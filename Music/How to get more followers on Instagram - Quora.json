            "answer_text": "If for some reason you need to gain followers, and you want them to be real people with active accounts, prepare to spend some time. Lots of time, I would say. Nobody will follow you just because you have some nice pictures (of course, it\u2019s kind of obvious prerequisite to even start the whole thing). People should also get know about you and feel that you are of some interest to them. So, you need to 1) find your target and then 2) let them notice you. You get their attention when you interact on their content in a human-like way. Simply liking some photos rarely helps, you\u2019d better leave the comment that proves that you are a real person yourself (no generic \u201cIt\u2019s awesome!\u201d or emoji shit, take some time and effort to master a custom message that shows why you appreciate both commented photo and entire feed of the person). Conversion on this method is close to 25% (my own observation) if you make good analysis on your target audience. Now, the numbers. If you have your own algorithm to quickly find potential followers, going through their feeds and interacting on their content might take 3\u20135 minutes. In half an hour you can show true attention to 6\u201310 people. Let\u2019s say 25% of them would follow you back - it means 2 real followers \u201cfarmed\u201d in 1/2-hour \u201csprint\u201d. Have two of such sprints a day, and you\u2019ll get 4 new real followers. If you do outstanding work to find potential followers and are able to write very good comments, you can boost the conversion to 50%. If your own feed is truly amazing and/or you already have a great followers/following ratio, it also helps. But if you just started, prepare to go the hard way until your Instagram karma starts working in your favour. Now sit back and think whether you want spending that much time of yours to boost some numbers that only slightly massage your ego and otherwise bring nothing for you. You can hire people to do this work for you. Let\u2019s say you find someone to \u201cfarm\u201d followers for you using the technique I described, and you pay them $10/hour. Then, 100 new real followers would cost you 5+ hours, meaning $50+. Growth is always exponential. The more followers you already have, the faster growth is. This means that reaching the phase of sustainable growth would require quite some time. If you only care about numbers, go the fast way and bring your $$$ to all those little agencies that would boost your numbers, just don\u2019t expect any quality in this kind of following. ",

Make a point to have your Instagram name in simple to discover places, similar to your page, facebook page, or bio of any online life. Find where most of your current supporters live and post around evening time during their time area. In the event that you are running on New York time post 8\u20139pm for the most raised extent of action as more individuals are on the application during these occasions.

Without any justifiable cause these channel have been shown to make more correspondence by methods for online frameworks organization media accounts. Partner with different records, and remark by and large! Virility goes the two particular ways, on the off chance that you need individuals to like your posts\u2014like theres. Answer to all messages, and remarks while staying dynamic on the web! Here are a few consistent principles, in no specific sales. These aren't any affirmation of getting significantly more true supporters, at any rate rehearsing any number of these should have a conspicuous effect. 1. Have a focus. You don't by and large need to hold quick to a tantamount subject, yet try to stick to an in vogue that is trustworthy. Check your profile/show and assurance none of the inages stick out (horrendous) or post of spot. In the event that you post food pictures or photos of your feline, ensure they're stunning pictures. 2. Remark and help out others you respect. Find clients accomplishing uncommon work and draw in with them, dependably. Be true. Clients who have a lower number of sweethearts (>3,000), and will without a doubt respond. Instagram is about the framework, and these are such affiliations that it's been established on. After some time, you develop an arrangement of clients, enjoying and remarking on one another's posts and supporting each other, and the get-together ends up being together \u2014 everybody benefits. 3. Go to an Instameet. This is an ideal system to discover near to clients who are enthusiastic about Instagram and photography. Clients that know you, truly, who you've met through Instagram will be your most noticeable publicists, and causes the experience of looking through your feed to appear, apparently, to be more lavish. These affiliations are incredibly novel comparing to accomplices, who you obviously know, considering, that are on Instagram and take diminish photographs of their feline. 4. Follow @instagram. Following Instagram is no attestation that you'll be included in a post or Suggested by Instagram, yet I feel it helps your chances. It will also keep wakeful with the latest on what top clients are doing, and you won't miss the most recent Weekend Hashtag Project (#WHP). 5. Partake in a Weekend Hashtag Project (#WHP). Every Friday, Instagram posts up a Weekend Hashtag Project (in the feed and on its blog), and each Monday it joins a great deal of the most inventive passages. It contrasts from week to week, and is as regularly as conceivable a verbalization or envisioned that clients are attempted to portray and tag with the hashtag. Regardless of whether you are barred, sharing can get your photographs before the eyeballs of the most remarkable clients, and can pass on new traffic to your photographs. 6. Use some hashtags, and use them sparingly. If you see a splendid or crafty hashtag, make a note of it and use it, on the off chance that it relates to your photograph. Adroit hashtag utilization can give your photographs even more equalization, and makes your photograph bound to be seen long after its posted. Forgettable, acclaimed marks like #photooftheday seem to have little impact other than making your posts look befuddled and malignant. In the event that you do a novel thing that is sharp, make your own hashtag, and rehash it. Regardless of whether it doesn't hop on, it's smooth to return and see the total of the posts you've done in that approach. In the event that I have further contemplations, I'll add them to this answer, in any case you can't end up being earnestly with following a few these. Any user might want to have a 1,000 real users, who are made sure about, dynamic and strong, than having 20,000 spambots who have 3 posts each. Reliably survey this when you're taking a gander at that sweetheart check! Instagram has been around for a long time \u2013 in any event in 'web time.' Furthermore, the stage keeps making. In fact, it was beginning late announced that there are 600 million individuals with an Instagram account, with 300 million of them utilizing the stage each day. In the occasion that you're a social media advertiser, this is raising news. With such a critical number of individuals utilizing the stage, there's a decent possibility that your normal interest get-together can be reached on their Instagram account. Additionally, in the event that you can make a gainful Instagram account that brags a mind blowing plan Instagram supporters, you'll have the decision to appear at your proposed interest pack constantly and adequately. Plainly, this by then sets the insecure issue of how to get more Instagram followers in the basic spot. Put forth an attempt not to extend. In this post, we will inspect how you can do only that. We'll look at two or three online life advancing ways of thinking that you can use, related to each other, that will have your Instagram supporter check developing all things considered dependably. Before the finishing of this post, you'll have the data that you have to go out and make a remarkable Instagram following of your own. We should start! Understand what substance accomplices with your gathering The basic development to follow in case you're doing fighting with how to get more Instagram fans, is to have a thought concerning who you need your Instagram supporters could be. Consider who you need to reach and what their mindset is. Understanding that will consider you to give your profile a 'voice' and will assist you with fining tune your substance endeavors and snatch some more likes per post. Exactly when you know who you need to reach and what they're figuring, you would then have the alternative to conceptualize how to make dazzling substance to pull in and please those Instagram supporters.

            "answer_text": "Gaining followers doesn\u2019t have to be hard if you play the game. The best way to learn is to observe those that have already figured it out\u2026 influencers! Regardless of niche, influencers have 3 things in common: They create a developed, unique editorial style.They represent a niche and leverage it consistently.They are community management experts!True, it might not sound easy at first but once you get a hang of these three things, followers will be coming to you. Here are some (actionable) tips to help you get started:  Balance promotional, educational, and entertainment/ inspiration posts. (This is called the 1/3 rule to posting.)Take advantage of the free tools out there to schedule & design your posts. (Buffer, Later, etc.)Establish your niche. This is crucial because there\u2019s so many users out there and you want to stand out. (For example, imagine you like \u201ccooking\u201d; that\u2019s really broad. Are you vegan? cooking desserts? cooking on a budget?? This is what defining your niche looks like.)Then use those keywords. Once you\u2019ve established your niche, then stick to it and use relevant industry keywords in your bio, your posts, hashtags (but not too many, it looks desperate.) This will bring coherency to your posting which attracts followers and\u2026brands!Collaborate with relevant brands! Doing reviews is a great way. It\u2019s all about creating mutual value.Transparency. If you are going to be working with brands, always prioritize transparent relationships for your sake and theirs.Vary your content types and don\u2019t neglect video!Run giveaways, contests, or other creative engagement boosters.Quality over quantity when it comes to posting.Engage your community: Always respond to comments, shares, and inquiries.Passion. You cannot force influence, it builds around people that are providing something valuable or entertaining. You\u2019re much more likely to succeed in this area if you\u2019re invested in what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s called authenticity. Brands take note of this, as well.What NOT to do? Buy followers or fake engagement. This drives away real followers and guarantees no genuine engagement on your posts. (More on that here.)  Answer based on my experience running an influencer marketing software company called Upfluence. We use advanced technology to help brands find the right influencers for their campaigns. Hope this helps and thanks for A2A! Vivien ",

            "answer_text": "If you just starting to learn how to get followers on Instagram, this tactics is best for beginners. Some Instagram newbies have seen their Instagram followers increase fast. I will share some tips and strategies on how you can start gaining followers pretty quickly. Just like Twitter, your bio on Instagram is there for the world to see. You only have room to write 150 characters in your bio, so you can\u2019t go crazy in this section. Remember that what you write in your bio and your tone should reflect the brand you\u2019re creating or solidifying. If you\u2019re a professional business or business professional then let your bio reflect that. I know that it can be tempting to use Emojis in your bio, but unless you\u2019re creating it for personal use only, try and leave them out. Emojis and strange fonts aren\u2019t all that great looking and tend to give a sort of spammy impression that can hurt your follower count. Some beginners like to join Instagram engagement groups, there are plenty of them: travel, beauty, fashion, fitness and etc. While it can be tempting to join the biggest Instagram engagement groups, the truth is you\u2019ll get a more targeted list of Instagram followers by sticking to your niche. In these groups, you can get followers and likes from people who have shared interests. But if you\u2019re serious about getting the attention, you should also return the favour by following fan pages for people who join the group. When you\u2019re just about to post an image with Instagram, there is a set of social buttons that allows you to post both in Instagram and then to social accounts like Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. You can connect your desired accounts and selectively post pictures to them. But doing this allows people to see that you post directly from Instagram. They can click on the picture and get taken back to your profile where they can easily follow you. This can help collect your following from your separate social channels under one roof where they can get to know you or your brand a little better. Follow people who like competing pages. To get that Instagram followers increase you need to find people who follow brands. Who are your biggest competitors on Instagram? Write them down. Then, browse their posts to see who\u2019s commenting on their posts. Follow them and engage with them. Keep in mind that when choosing competitors on Instagram it\u2019s better to go for the smaller brands. Why? Because if you were selling makeup brushes and trying to get people who comment on Sephora, there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019re not the right audience despite being in a similar niche. Bigger brands tend to have more customer loyalty. Before you post your first picture, you\u2019ll want to nail down who you want to engage. If you\u2019re a mom blogger looking to gain followers for your blog, then your target market is more than likely going to be other moms. Therefore, whatever image and corresponding description you post should have a bend towards that. (i.e. elegant, feminine, helpful, cute, informative, etc.) However, if you\u2019re a fitness trainer, then your market is likely going to be those interested in healthy living which can coverages ranging from younger people too much older ones \u2014 both male and female. Your posts should still reflect your message, and posts with inspirational quotes can be a big help when growing your follower base. Whatever you plan to do on Instagram, knowing who it is that you\u2019re trying to attract as followers will help you to post more effectively. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly let me clarify that the importance people and brands place on follower counts or the impressions their content receives is grossly overvalued. I can\u2019t say numbers don\u2019t matter, but the value everyone places on these numbers needs to be reconsidered. There is just too much emphasis on the width of engagement\u2014how many potential connections they make\u2014rather than the depth of those interactions which, in my eyes, is far more important. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have an Instagram account with a million followers or if you just created a new profile today, this is absolutely the advice I would give to anyone looking to build a more meaningful community on Instagram or online. The reason I feel comfortable answering this question is that I\u2019ve spent the last 10 years of my career trying to understand user psychology and reverse engineer attention into an engaged community online. This is not theory, it\u2019s practical advice that has worked for me and thousands of other individuals, companies, products, and brands. I started using these tactics on Twitter but obviously migrated them to Facebook and Instagram. No matter which platform comes next, this will be the behavior I deploy to build awareness, and more importantly, community online. The truth is, the way to win on social media is to actually be social! The number of Instagram followers you have means nothing if you can\u2019t build a community of like-minded people who care and engage. The only real way to do this from scratch is to become part of the conversation, you need to participate and engage with people who have the same interests as you. I came up with what I like to call the $1.80 Instagram strategy which translates to leaving your personal $.02 on the top 9 trending Instagram posts for 10 different hashtags that are relevant to your brand or business every single day. By the end, you haven\u2019t just left your $.02, but a full $1.80 of thoughts online in the specific category, niche or industry you want to become a part of. I\u2019m going to use the example of meditation. imagine that you are deep into meditation and have been practicing for years and now you want to build a business around meditation or grow your personal brand. STEP 1: FINDING THE BEST HASHTAGS TO FOLLOW The first thing you need to do is identify the 10 most important/relevant hashtags in your field. The best part about searching for hashtags is that you can quickly and easily identify related tags in your industry or niche. Once you search meditation, Instagram recommends related hashtags to follow. Spend time searching not only the most popular hashtags but lesser known hashtags that still relate and can make a real impact. When you find a hashtag, or better yet a post, the first thing you need to do is identify who that person is. Click on the post, identify the account, read their bio, look at their profile, understand their likes, dislikes, and activity. Read the copy below and engage, even if the account only has 190 followers but every single post that user creates has 60 likes and 20 comments, REACH OUT and leave your $.02. The thought that a low number of followers can be considered \u201cirrelevant\u201d makes no sense to me. You can have 10, 10,000, or 1,000,000 followers and all it takes is for one post to be noticed by one person to cause a social media chain reaction. The absolute number does not matter. One retweet, one repost, one link in an email is enough to get the ball rolling. STEP 2: LEAVE YOUR INSTAGRAM COMMENT $.02 FOR THE 1.80 INSTAGRAM STRATEGY Now that you\u2019ve identified the top 9 posts for your top 10 hashtags\u2026 it\u2019s time to leave your $.02 which means leaving your thoughts and trying to provide value where you can. If you see someone in the comments who has a question and you know how to respond, answer. If you love the post and admire the aesthetic, say so! If you have thoughts about the quote or the copy in their post, reply! If the image reminds you of another content creator, tag them. If you think a friend would benefit from seeing it, share it with them. Comment, like, engage, respond, share. These are the simple and easy ways you can leave your $.02. Realistically this shouldn\u2019t take any more than 2 minutes per post. You don\u2019t have to write a book or say something profound, you just have to engage and interact. That is what it means to be social. But please please please be authentic to yourself and the person on that post. We all know what a spam comment looks like. And if you really want to connect, send a DM to the creator. Mention the post and why you liked it. Respond to their story and say something valuable. Ask if you can help, collaborate, promote, etc. STEP 3. CONTINUE TO COMMENT, LIKE AND ENGAGE ON INSTAGRAM It\u2019s as easy as that. The overall process is incredibly simple. It\u2019s $.02 , on 9 posts for 10 hashtags every day. That all adds up to $1.80. No matter how much value you provide, this is still a game of numbers. You have to be willing to give yourself more at-bats. Everyone else is only leaving $.02. You\u2019re leaving a $1.80 Every single day. Even if that is only one new follower a day or 1 new idea about what works and what doesn\u2019t on Instagram. No matter what, I guarantee you will learn. You will learn something about the platform, about culture, about human behavior, about how people interact online, about empathy and humility and perspective, it\u2019s all there through this little process. It\u2019s leaving your $.02 and being part of a real community. So, start deploying the $1.80 strategy. You\u2019re going to drop $1.80 a day, two cents at a time, nine top posts, on ten different hashtags, every day. And that will slowly but surely build an audience that knows you and appreciates your content. You\u2019re going to leave $1.80 in karma, $1.80 in community, $1.80 in your thoughts. You\u2019re not there to say follow, follow, follow. The way to be discovered is to either put out great content, and have one piece go viral, or the way I like it, and the strategy that has always worked for me is to become part of the community. You will pick up three to four followers a day, which are meaningful. Not bots and spam, but meaningful connections. That means you\u2019ll probably receive 100 new meaningful followers in a month. Which means you\u2019ll put out a piece of content and if one of them is special, and one of the people that follow you has a bigger audience and decided to share it, then away you go. But that\u2019s not even the best part. You know what\u2019s so great about the $1.80 Instagram strategy? It\u2019s not that you\u2019re going to get exposure, or you\u2019re going to get some followers, or that you\u2019re going to contribute and be a great community member, but you\u2019re also going to learn. Because you\u2019re going to watch and consume, 90 pieces of content a day that are doing well on Instagram, which is then going to inspire and help you strategize the content that you yourself are going to put out on Instagram. That\u2019s a really good use of three hours a day. Let me know how it goes. If you liked this answer, say hi on: INSTAGRAM | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | SNAPCHAT | ITUNES ",

For example:-If you already have 20 followers then they are your permanent fix.If you increase +100 they are combined (stable/unstable) fix.Permanent + combined fix will make 120 followers which is your current followersWithin 2 days followers dropYou can expect to have 80 followers at the end of 2 daysHere 20 followers are permanent and 60 followers are stable which is a duo fix(permanent/stable).You need not worry about losing followers againIf you want to increase to 120 followers try to gain 200 followers and after unstables leave out you are left with a duo fixNote that the stable fix won\u2019t take much time to turn unstable and unfollow you if they find you unpleasant. I was able to get a duo fix of 1800 followers by gaining a combined fix of 2000 followers. Remember the more the followers the more the unstables in it.Please note the above terminologies are solely invented by me and hold no real meaning. I am referring to those to make this more easily understandable. When you gain followers by doing above method you accept that you treat all stable/unstable fixes as mindless beings and just a media of transaction/cash unless you want to create a permanent fix by getting to know them ",

            "answer_text": "The recent Google Panda updates have made mainstream news and the general public is more aware about internet advertising methods. I better recommend you PRO. It\u2019s well worth your time and effort to create compelling and engaging footage that will have your customers coming back for more. Today's best marketers know how to promote themselves, their companies, their products and services in such a way that their potential customers actually ASK for more information, or to be updated on changes in the industry. Through social networking, you can be at the same \"cocktail parties\" as your present and future customers. Within the broad umbrella term \"social MEDIA\" is social NETWORKING, the first of six genres. There are literally thousands of social networking sites (see graphic, right), so unless you have very unusual interests, you'd mostly likely want to sign up for the most popular social networks with lots of people, or do some quick research before signing up for a random site. But for every person or business that has a big, receptive following, there are thousands more that don't. Relevant Images caught by users's eyes give you more clicks and traffic than text ads whatever you write best in your ad. All you need is to hone your skills to acquire the traffic on it. Quite a few people have scrutinized the need of Instagram Likes. If you have not heard of the social networking site called Facebook then you have either been marooned on a desert island or living under a rock. Facebook members could organize and depose Mark Zuckerberg. In other words, it's usually best to join a site that already has traction, momentum, and lots of members. Often, on the best affinity sites, content is so \"rich\" (plentiful), deep and frequently changing that members can literally spend hours browsing the site, discovering more about that particular interest area, if it's an in which area they are heavily interested, like a hobby, sport or a group in which they're a member. Now anyone can share anything, and because people tend to believe what they see, false information can spread just as, if not more easily, than the truth. Now a prospective new follower will read this and know What this person does and Where he or she does it. If you are not adaptive, then you might be in trouble because social media in nature will change constantly. The bottom line is know what you are getting into before even accepting a connection on social media from a past love interest. Even the best business marketing strategies fail if you are targeting the wrong audience. In recent years, Instagram has come a long way from being merely a photo-sharing social channel to develop into an influential weapon of brand marketing and advertising. While the supply and demand shift for paid media becomes more saturated, it leaves an incredible opening for the brands that make great content to grow the right way. How to Get More Likes on Your Facebook Business Page is a million dollar question with a simple answer. 2. Get Brand Clarity. How to Ruin a Business Online if they Ripped You Off and Get Your Money Back! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to act all cheerful like all those big accounts are, and tell you that the key to Instagram growth is to consistently post good quality material, but then I\u2019d be lying. There is a lot more involved than simply just those two elements. A lot is going on behind the curtains where you, the followers, can\u2019t see. There is a lot of collaboration going on between big accounts. A lot of deceiver, fraud, etc. There are different types of pages. First, there are the video pages, then, the meme pages, and lastly, the text-based pages. For video pages and meme, it would boil down to these 2 elements: Hitting the Explore pageShoutoutsThe Explore page is that little magnifying glass-looking thingy at the bottom of the screen that when you go to, there are a lot of random pictures and videos from people that you may or may not follow. The way to get on the Explore page is to get a lot of people to like your picture immediately. When a person that you follow likes a picture, it will get recommended to you on your Explore page, typically with the text based on pictures you\u2019ve liked or based on people you follow. The key to getting on the Explore page is to first get a lot of people from the same niche (say, videos and memes) to like your photo. The reason that I say they should be from the same niche is because when a person likes a certain category of things and follows an account within that niche, it is more likely that they would like and follow other content from that niche too. So, say, if someone follows an account called Viral Videos and there is another account called Viral Content and another one called Flowers and Pottery, they are more likely to follow Viral Content if they already follow Viral Video. In order to get the necessary amount of likes to hit the Explore page, you have to do something. It\u2019s very rare that, suddenly, a lot of people from the same niche as you would start liking your content without expecting anything in return for that. For that reason, there is a concept called \u201clikes groups\u201d which is basically a lot of people from the same niche creating a group and asking the other ones to like and comment on their posts, and, in return, they will like and comment on the other person\u2019s post too. You can also do this through DMs, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a group. When a post hits Explore, it will be seen by a lot more people than the number of people who follow you. About shoutouts \u2014 shoutouts are basically when a person tells their followers to go and follow a certain account, usually in the same niche as the first account. In order to get a shoutout, you either haver to give the other person a shoutout too, or pay them money. You have to negotiate on that. However, for text-based accounts, it\u2019s a whole different story. These are the tricks for text-based accounts: Follow for followComment for followLike for followShoutoutsFollow for follow basically means that you go and follow a lot of people from the same niche as you, and since your username is usually fitting to your niche and they are interested in that niche, they will come and follow you in return for your follow. Following them does not serve a purpose for you, other than the fact that you want to get recognized by the people you follow, who might be interested in your content, and would follow you back. Comment for follow is a bit harder and more time-taking. It\u2019s basically follow for follow, but instead of following the person to get their attention, you comment on their recent post/s. Like for follow should be obvious by now. And you already know what shoutouts are, and how you can get them. The reason that hitting the Explore page does not work on text-based accounts is because Instagram\u2019s algorithms basically do not allow it. I don\u2019t know why, but that is what I have gotten from the experience of myself and other big and semi-big accounts. Yes, of course, there are other accounts in the niche of photography, music, etc, but (ironically) they are not as mainstream as entertainment accounts, and I don\u2019t really know much about them. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "A2A It\u2019s always nice to Aim for the top on any SNS. Well to get started on your journey to get maximum Insta followers, you can get it through following methods:- Social sites through buying them:- That\u2019s indeed the fastest way and it can help you amass high numbers rather fast. It will also help you get popular on Insta too. But it comes with a big drawback. Number one, they won\u2019t be your active followers so they following you and being active on your posts would be pretty rare and it actually brings down the credibility of your profile. I mean, just think what\u2019s the point of having so many followers without them engaging with your posts and stuff. Number two, They are expensive to purchase and not credible also, just fake ones, mostly.Posting good content:- This helps you gain true and active followers to your profile and let me assure you that it\u2019s really not easy. But you can do so by following certain ways like the ones below:-Post at the time where majority of your current followers are active. If your posts gain popularity then certainly they\u2019ll get more hits on Insta.Add tags on your photos which makes them different. Tagging your photos makes you cater to a niche audience which in turn, if they like you would continue to be very active on your posts.Find good content to post on your profile. Think about content which would make people want to follow. Think of something which you are passionate about.Ask for free shoutout from people who owns free shoutout pages.Remember in the end, amassing followers shouldn\u2019t be the only agenda for you to be on Insta. It\u2019s a good tool to have lots of fun with people on it. Enjoy the experience, that\u2019s what\u2019s matter. Follow the golden rule in life:- Rather then being socially active be active socially. Hope it helps ~ Vip$ ",

            "answer_text": "I am the founder of a social media tool called OneUp that allows you to schedule and automatically repeat your posts on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Instagram for only $5 per month. I am obviously biased, but I think it is the best way to get more followers on Instagram. Here are some of the features: Direct scheduling to Instagram from a computer - OneUp allows you to schedule and post directly to Instagram and Instagram Stories from a computer, no push notification necessary. Posting to multiple pages - For people who are posting to more than one social network at a time, OneUp makes it easy to post to FB Pages and Groups, LinkedIn profiles and pages, and Twitter accounts, Pinterest, and Instagram (including Stories) all at once.  Repeating post - OneUp gives you the option to repeat your posts automatically. This allows you to resurface old posts that otherwise would have never been seen again. Also for anyone that has a Facebook Group with daily themes that repeat every week (such as \"Make it happen Monday\"), OneUp makes it easy to entirely automate this.  RSS feed automation - If there are any blogs, publications, podcasts, or YouTube channels that put out good content consistently, you can add the RSS feed links in OneUp, then whenever new content is posted from those places, it is automatically shared to the pages you select.   Chrome Extension - Using the OneUp Chrome extension, you can easily schedule many images at once from any website, such as sunsets for example. You can choose which images from the website you want to post to social media, bulk update or individually update the descriptions and links for each post, then schedule them to be posted with a set interval (such as every 60 minutes), or choose custom dates and times for all of them.    Analytics - OneUp lets you see which posts are getting the best engagement.  Customizable UTM parameters - OneUp lets you customize UTM parameters so you can keep track of how your links are performing in Google Analytics.  Link Shortening - Connect your Bitly account and OneUp will automatically shorten any links and allow you to track clicks through Bitly.  ",

            "answer_text": "Today i will tell you how to get more followers on Instagram.  1. Share Images People Can Relate To If you check out the most popular Instagram accounts, you\u2019ll notice a common theme. All of their photos are something most people can relate to and connect with. They\u2019re personal, unique, and original. By sharing these types of photos, you\u2019re establishing a connection with your audience, which is the absolute best way to attract people to your account. In short, make sure your Instagram account is authentic and original. 2. Post at the Right Time Before posting anything onto Instagram, consider what time zone the majority of your audience lives in and what time they check their Instagram account. Because of its mobility, there isn\u2019t really a favorite time for Instagram users \u2013 engagement is high on Wednesday between 5 to 6 PM, while more people post on Thursdays Regardless, a majority of Instagram users log in when they have the extra time, such first thing in the morning, on their way home from work or school, or on Sundays. 3. Use Popular & Relevant Hashtags Search Google to find popular hashtags, which are used to organize photos. You can then use the relevant trending hashtags to you or your industry to gain more visibility for your photos, which should generate more interaction. For example, the top 10 hashtags are: #love, #instagood, #me; #like, #follow, #cute, #photooftheday, #tbt, #followme, and #tagsforlikes. While hashtags are an important asset when attracting new followers, you don\u2019t want to go overboard. Instead of posting an entire paragraph of hashtags, try to select one to three hashtags per photo. Any more than three will seem spammy.  4. Follow Others If you want to follow others, then you\u2019re going to have to follow them. This is a simple rule of reciprocation that is common on all social media formats. So, instead of just uploading photos and expecting people to come to you, you also have to put yourself out there. In other words, you have to be active. Search for users and brands that share your interests and comment, then like and share their photos. Follow Instagram stars and influencers and engage with them, or even ask for a shout-out. You could even look for tags containing tags like: #shoutout, #TagsForLikes, #ilovemyfollowers, and #follow.  5. Completely Fill Out Your Bio Your bio should be used to feature a call-to-action, branded hashtags, and links, which is a big deal in the quest for new Instagram users. It\u2019s this section where users will discover who you or your brand are and whether or not they will follow you. Don\u2019t, however, plead, sound desperate or come across as spammy. For example, do not include \u201cFollow People Who Follow Me!\u201d in your bio. You want to let users know who you are and why they should follow you. 6. Ask Questions in Photo Captions A simple and effective way to receive more likes on your photos is to simply ask a question in the photo\u2019s caption. Not only will this increase your amount of likes, but it can also increase comments. And, as we\u2019ve mentioned numerous times already, engagement is the best way to increase the amount of followers on Instagram. 7. Remember Why You Are on Instagram Before you get carried away and start posting all sorts of content onto Instagram, take a step back and remember why you joined in the first place. Why do you need more followers? Do you want to boost your ego? Are you looking to gain more exposure and feedback for your photography? Do you want to use Instagram as a promotional tool for your business? Understanding why you joined Instagram can help you attract new followers because you\u2019ll know the audience you want to target. This means you\u2019ll be searching and interacting with people in your niche, as opposed to casting too wide of a net. Another solid tactic is creating a call to action. By having a clear CTA, such as \u201cDouble-Tab to Like! \u201d people are more likely to engage with your posts since they\u2019ll be aware of what you want from them. Again, when you have more engagement, you get more exposure, which in turn, gives you the opportunity to get more Instagram followers.  8. Post Frequently, But Not Too Much Once you attract new followers, how can you keep their interest? One of the easiest ways is to post relevant and attractive photos on a consistent basis; usually a few photos per day is just fine. If you have hundreds of images to share, spread them throughout several days. If you flood followers\u2019 feeds you will not only have people unfollow you, your account won\u2019t be as attractive to new followers. 9. Use Filters & Apps Do you remember what made Instagram so unique and popular in the first place? Filters. It gave people a chance to personalize their images. And, the more original and captivating your photos are, the more likely people are to share and follow your account. Since Instagram has 20 filters included in its app, there\u2019s really no excuse for your photos to be filter-free. On top of filters, you can also make the most out of the various photo-editing apps to touch-up your photos before sharing on Instagram.  ",

            "answer_text": " Image source Hey-hey! Growing Instagram is probably the most discussed topic today! And I\u2019m sure everyone here wants to get more followers, right? But what do you exactly do to get started? Below I added some tips to get more popular on Instagram with spending no money. The first thing you should start if you want to move your Insta account to the top is to forget about all online services that sell likes and followers. Instagram has completely changed its algorithm for 2019, so any fake activity will not help you to become more visible.Actually, I think it's great news! Because now you have even more chances to promote your Instagram account for free and become recognized in your niche. So, the second step to getting more followers on Instagram is to identify your target audience. You should be confident in who your followers are and what they like to see in their feed. The third step you should do is to turn your account into a business one and connect it to your Facebook business page. It\u2019s pretty simple to do. Follow this guide to get an Instagram Business account: Create a Facebook business (not your personal) page.Go to the setting of your Instagram account and choose Accounts \u2192 Switch to Business Account.Connect your Instagram Business Account to your Facebook Business Page. Here\u2019s a great guide to this step: How do I link my Instagram account to a Facebook Page that I manage?The fourth thing to become visible in Instagram is adding the right profile information. Your name and profile bio must contain relevant keywords.  If you\u2019re a local business, adding your location in your Insta Bio will simplify the way to find you for your customers and increase trust. Also, you\u2019re allowed to add a link to your website, YouTube channel or another social network to your Instagram profile. Step five is all about your content. Here are the most important points: Be consistent (post every day). At least at the beginning you Insta journey.Post only high-quality content! Everything you add to your grid must be eye-catching, bright, intriguing and exciting.Provide value. Want people to listen to you and trust you? Be an expert.Tell a story. People prefer true stories more than advertising.Use the right CTAs. Interact with your audience. Don\u2019t be afraid of asking questions.Using the right #HASHTAGS is the sixth step on the way to your popular Instagram account. The main rule: Don\u2019t use the same hashtags for all your posts! If you use the same set of hashtags every time, most likely Instagram will consider your content as spam and decrease your reach. All you need is create about 7\u201310 sets of relevant hashtags and alternate them. It\u2019s also important to find hashtags relevant to your niche. I don\u2019t recommend that you use hashtags with 1 million and more followers. Add less frequently used but suitable hashtags and try to get on TOP for them. The next seventh tip to follow to get popular on Instagram is adding Stories! Add photos and videos to your Stories every day with mandatory location and relevant hashtags. Stories are the easiest way to expand your reach for a new audience. Stories, also great to interact with your audience with such features like Questions, Quiz, Countdown. The eight advice for getting more Instagram visitors is using live streaming and IGTV features. Instagram continues to promote these features and they give their users more impressions and reach. Constantly Like, Comment, Follow! It's a ninth tip. Use these actions for both your competitors and their followers. Yes, it\u2019s important that you interact with competitors in your niche too. You need to do this to be shown among the suggested accounts of your competitor.  The last but not least tip is to monitor your account statistics every day. For this, go to Insights and find out what time your followers are the most active, which of your content are most engaged and saved, where in the world is the biggest concentration of your followers. Good luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways, but first you need a base, to be able to build a base you must use websites like Befollowers dot com, you can get thousands to get even more organic, otherwise you will be ignored like the rest of us. Then I would highly recommend: Use hashtags This is the best way to be searchable. Look for some popular hashtags on you rniche and combine them with some less popular, but more specific. Add to your story with geolocation and hashtags Business accounts often underestimate the power of Stories. Use them! And add the geolocation and hashtag in order to appear in more searches. Follow your competitor\u2019s followers If they follow the competitor, most probably they will want to follow you as well. After you follow, you may want to like or comment to 1-2 photos, just to raise the chances to follow you back. It takes lot of time but it worths it. Interact with people\u2019s content You can search the hashtags you are interested in and then interact with the content. People will notice you and if your content is good enough, some will follow you. >>Some more advance tactics are: Engagement groups These are groups formed in Facebook or Telegram. You put content there and then every member interacts with it. This will get you high reach and more chances for people who discover you to be willing to follow. Get influencers to mention you Collaborate with influencers on your niche. They have a lot of followers, so if they mention / tag you, you will get a lot of exposure. Offer them something before you request a mention. Power likes There are services who sell Power Likes. These are likes on your content that come from large accounts, with content similar to yours. When an account with hundreds of thousand followers like your posts, they get much more engagement. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Be consistent All the above are some ways you can follow to reach your first 1000 followers but at the end of the day it all comes down to one thing: Consistency. You need to be consistent with the content you upload and the actions you take. Only then you will be able to see the number of your followers increase! ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to get more followers on instagram. The idea of Instagram is to connect with people and for other people to connect with you. So i'll give a few quick tips here. 1. Follow people/accounts who are interested in what you are interested in: note that popular accounts have so many people following them that they might not follow you back. However, accounts with fewer followers are most likely to follow back. Use Discover to search for hashtags that you are interested in. eg if you are interested in music, type in #music or the genre you want and you can find posts on them.  2. Be consistent with your posts. I have found that people like accounts that are active or else they unfollow. So decide if you want to post daily or hourly. Whatever works for you. Don't overcrowd though. I don't think you should post more than 4 times a day. 3. Post your relevant images. Some people say you should post your best images but frankly, even though that's a good thing, i have found that it doesn't matter so much as long as the image is relevant.Also, post pictures of you doing stuff! Reading, playing, dancing, hanging out with friends or family. People love that stuff. 4. Use (relevant/popular) hashtags. Very important. Just as you can search for people using hashtags, you want others to be able to find you too.   Do not buy followers.. That's for sure. Instagram is about connecting. Meeting new people. Seeing their experiences in pictures and being a part of it. You want your followers to be highly engaging. Not silent. That's why it's important that you grow your followers the right way. If someone follows you, then you know they are interested in getting to know you. Get an app like Crowdfire to unfollow those who unfollow you. Personally, I think that it is silly when people do that. Why did they follow in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my 7 tips to build a large and engaged audience on Instagram 1 - Never, ever buy likes or folowers from websites or use free apps. I know a lot of people on here are saying to do it, but trust me it\u2019s not a good method. These followers and likes are almost always junk and are never engaging. It\u2019s better to have an Instagram account that has 100 loyal followers that actually like and comment on your posts, than to have an account with 10,000 followers that never engage with your content. It\u2019s always so sad to see accounts with thousands of followers and only get 50 likes at most. This is a clear sign that you have junk followers and it will be almost impossible to monetize your account. 2 - Post Frequently and on a Schedule Instagram is constantly changing their algorithm for how they show pictures on news feeds. It is important to understand that the less engaging your posts are the less Instagram will show your photos and videos. So we want to share throughout the day so people see our posts and start engaging with them. If we post a few times a week, chances are people won\u2019t ever see your photos and eventually your account will be forgotten by them. 3 - Be Engaged Actually take the time to respond back to the people that leave comments on your photos. This shows that you are an involved profile and more people will want to start commenting, liking, and sharing your photos and videos. 4 - Share high quality and large photos Don\u2019t share low quality photos. Make sure they aren\u2019t blurry or pixelated. Also, start posting larger photos. Instagram now supports more than just their iconic square photos. We want our photos to pop and catch our followers attention. The larger they are the bigger the chances are that are followers will notice them and engage with them.  Here is a small account that I manage. Notice how the picture on the left takes up almost the entire screen and the one on the right is half the size. I posted the one on the left prior to realizing that larger images are working way better. Smaller images leave room for someone else\u2019s photo to appear underneath or above it, which means less attention will be put on our photo. 5 - Stick to Your Niche Stay consistent with what you post. If you are a weight loss profile don\u2019t post about basketball teams. If you are a travel account don\u2019t post about cute puppies. Post relevant photos and videos. This also applies to hashtags. Do some research. Go to your top competitor\u2019s accounts and see what hashtags they are using. We want to take advantage of Hastags. 5.1 - Hashtags Continued There is no true science to the amount of hashtags you should use, but they number I see most thrown around is eleven. Put at least 11 well related hashtags on your photos. And make sure to not put the hashtags in the description. This will definitely look spammy. Post the hashtags in a comment. As soon as you share the photo, comment on it by writing out the hashtags you chose. Don\u2019t worry, the picture will still show up in the search results. 6 - Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Collab Share other account\u2019s photos, ask them to share yours. Instagram is a social network, so be social. A growing Instagram growth method is paying for shout outs. (I know I said not to pay for followers or likes, but this is different. Most of the followers and likes you pay for are from fake accounts used just to like and follow accounts and do nothing else) Buying shout outs is a great way to build your following because you are reaching out to accounts that are showing that they actually have an engaging audience that are interested in what they post. Now, this can be a costly method for growth, but it is definitely something to consider. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Today, Instagram has become one of the most important tools of social media marketing, networking, and selling for a variety of brands as well as individuals. With time, it has gained a remarkable position in the digital marketing industry. Instagram, with more than 200 million active members and counting, is a platform for millions who constantly share and post over 60 million images/videos/ stories every single day. In terms of engagement rates, other social media platforms cover less than 0.1%, whereas, Instagram seems to reach on a high level with brand advertisements Whether you are a big brand or you are looking for a way to become an eye candy on Instagram as an individual, you should strive for the best. You can be a unicorn in the world of social media by your constant presence on Instagram, outperforming every other company or individual. You can create fresh content daily, use new and creative images, right hashtags, get engaged in conversations on your post, but still, you find your followers remains the same. You don\u2019t even remember the last time your followers went up. You can achieve this by working on the following tried and tested strategies. Make a checklist for applying these ideas on your Instagram profile, and see how you increase your followers and visibility on Instagram. Direct Message Engagement Group Create a direct message group of 20 people, having similar interests, with a high-quality audience. This is an effective way to start the engagement, and several Instagram accounts use this technique to help each other grow by liking and commenting on each other\u2019s posts. The more participation in an account, the more effective it is. To increase the followers organically, you\u2019ll need a minimum of 50-100 groups participating in the daily activities. Post viral content Look what is trending on the explorer tab on your Insta profile. You\u2019ll see a number of viral pictures and videos with thousands of likes and comments on them. You can find videos of daily hacks, makeup tutorials, bodybuilding, and many more on IGTV videos, presently the most popular one. Most of this content is called as the viral content, and this is a unique way to make a way out there. The more you post viral content, the more you have chances to get popular and gain thousands of likes on your Instagram. Be Smart with Hashtags For every post that you create, make sure to use relevant hashtags, as they will help people to find you easily. Being creative with your hashtags is all you need for a perfect start, but you must keep in mind that using hashtags that are unfamiliar to people will increase your chances of getting lost in the pond of fish. You can also be extremely specific with your hashtags like using long-tail keywords that are more intent to help you find the right people. However, if you use trending hashtags like #photooftheday #aboutlastnight, #instagood or the plain tags like #peace or #fun your chances of getting noticed by people, increases. To be good with anything, make sure to work on it every day. Instagram is a combination of creative images and descriptive content, so make sure to create an intriguing profile for your followers. ",

            "answer_text": "Instagram changes its algorithm on a very regular basis and its impossible to determine what brings you the most followers. But there are certainly few things that can help you increase your followers organically. Curated below are the some of the tips that really helped us blow our accounts. Niche Instagram knows what your account is about and who would be interested in your content. If you like a lot of dog videos and post a lot of content about dogs, it sure knows that you would be interested in dog videos and your content would be good for other folks who are interested in dogs. If its possible to pick a specific niche, go for it.Videos vs Image posts If your moto is to gain followers, post video content over image content any day. Currently Instagram suggests your content to other users who might be interested in your content. If any of your video goes viral then you will gain massive followers overnightRegular Posts Some say to not post too much content, but for us posting too much content is what gained us a lot of followers. Try posting during different times of the day and different frequency and see what really works for your accountFollow Unfollow Ethically it might be a wrong thing to do, but for your account to be visible it is really necessary that you have some amount of initial followers (around 2000) for instagram to start suggesting your videos to others. Do not go following anyone or everyone, make sure that you are following people in your own niche. Best to follow people who comment on others postsWe are currently managing 30+ accounts with a total of around 300K+ followers. Our strategy is very simple, we repost content of other users every 1 hour. To help us with the process we built an automation software that reposts content that we like every one hour. ",

            "answer_text": "To avoid getting banned by Instagram, you should know the Instagram\u2019s rules and restrictions to seem normal and not a bot. You shouldn\u2019t take too many actions in short time because Instagram may recognize you as a spam and it would ban your account if you keep doing a lot. First of all you should know that the limitations are not the same for all Instagram users and depends on different factors such as: The age of your Instagram accountThe number of your followersYour account\u2019s engagementYour account\u2019s activity Follow/ unfollow Following and unfollowing is count as the same actions. The daily limit is 200 a day. 10 follows and unfollows per hour would keep your account safe and saves your account from being suspended. Also, there is no limit on how many people can follow you. Remember to start slow and then gradually increase the number of following and unfollowing week by week. Make sure that you are not spamming Instagram. Likes The maximum number is 1000 a day. But it is not the same for all Instagram users. In order to keep your account safe and not locked out, you should be satisfied with less than 700 likes per day. Comments It is about 180 to 200 per day. Don\u2019t post the same comment over and over. Instagram recognizes duplicate comments, and it would punish your account for what you did. And don\u2019t leave emojis without text as a comment, they look like spam. Direct messages About 50 to 80 new conversations per day are the safe zone. Note: If you are a new Instagram user, your total action limit is 500 a day. This includes Like, Comment, Follow, unfollow. Also, you can send 20 to 50 direct messages a day. Hashtag Choosing the right hashtag would capture people\u2019s attention, and you\u2019ll get more Likes and Followers. But don\u2019t overuse them. You should use up to 30 hashtags per post. IGTV As you know, Instagram rolled out IGTV about a year ago which lets you share the video. You can create videos for up to 10 minutes, but some users can post up to one hour long videos. Story The story limitation is for users who share too many stories. You can add up to 100 stories. Story highlight Fortunately, there is no limit for story highlights. Tag If you are interested in tagging people, you should know that the maximum number is 20. Mention You can mention up to 10 Instagram users per post. ",

            "answer_text": "You can choose if you want to go the organic route (not spending money) or you want to spend money on promos and ads. If you don\u2019t want to (most people don\u2019t) then below you can read some of my advice that work really great on getting those initial followers and starting to grow. First of all, you need to have good content and post consistently (at least once per day). You need to choose a niche, and try to niche it down a bit especially in the beginning of your account (what I mean by it is you don\u2019t want to make general account where you posts selfies or your content is all over the place cars, travel, memes, motivational quotes, fitness, etc) you want to choose one niche like for example travel and than niche it down some more for example showcasing just beaches or mountains or Arial pictures, etc. It will be much easier to grow if you niche it down like that. Make nice profile picture, if your username doesn\u2019t look clean, short and kinda memorable, try to come up with a new username that does, write down good BIO explaining what your followers can expect and mention your niche if we use example of a niche from above you can do something like: \u201cShowcasing best beaches all around the world Every traveller loves gorgeous beaches\u201d add some emojis as well (it\u2019s easier to grab people\u2019s attention with emojis ) as you can see I\u2019ve mentioned two keywords beaches and travel.You also want to have good caption structure and do some hashtag research and write down several sets of hashtags (I usually use 25\u201330 hashtags, 30 is the limit set by Instagram btw).Post stories as well it helps engage with your audience and you get nice circle around your profile pic which makes your profile stand out moreNow the thing with Instagram is, you need to get the initial following in order to start ranking for hashtags and to grow organically. The best method that works right now to get those initial 1\u20132.5k followers (depending on your niche and quality of your content) is follow-unfollow method, you basically find a page in your niche that\u2019s bigger than yours and start following people who liked their recent photo, people get notification that you\u2019ve followed them, check your account and follow you back if they like what they see. You need to do this manually, especially since recent updates, don\u2019t try any bots and tools, that\u2019s the reason why most people fail with this method.If you have time you should also post meaningful comments on other peoples photos (especially those you are following) because it will help you gain more followers and also get you more follow-backs from the previous method.If you did everything right and post consistantly once you get initial 1\u20132.5k followers your account will start to grow on its own organically just from posting consistently. When this happens and you start ranking for hashtags, it\u2019s usually a good idea to increase the posting frequency because it will help you grow even faster.Once you hit 5k followers you can start contacting other similar pages in your niche to exchange shoutouts and collab which will help you get more exposure and accelerate your growth.Once you hit 10k followers, you get the swipe up option in stories (linking out) and you can start monetizing your account.Depending on how you execute this, you can grow pretty fast and completely free. I\u2019m currently growing a new account from scratch to 10k followers live on YT and showcasing exactly what I\u2019m doing if you want you can check that out: Equals Cash I started this 40 days ago, and the account has 4200+ followers currently with great engagement rate (2000 likes per post) and the growth is accelerating. It\u2019s pretty fast considering the account is completely new, and the niche is kinda competitive. I\u2019m also working on a lot of different projects and I don\u2019t actually have much time to dedicate to this one. If I had more time I would be able to grow even faster. Keep in mind that the first 1k followers are usually the hardest to obtain. After that, you will start experiencing the snowballing effect. I\u2019ve used this exact strategy to grow first 10k in just 15 days in 2019, while everyone is complaining about engagement drops. Hope that helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "We are living in digital era. Its one of the easiest era to build your business online without spending any dime, and grow to millions of followers. BUT, it takes efforts, consistency, uniqueness to be in the top. Growing thousands of followers for many different accounts, i have figured out some of the best ways that helps me grow Instagram followers in a fast and a organic way. Using these ways you can grow your account even if you have less than 100 followers to hundred thousands of followers within months. Below i am listing some of the ways using which you grow your followers, these tips not only helps you grow your followers but also to improve your profile engagement, brand awareness and have a good social presence. Content is the KING : Original Content : This is one of the most important reason for success of any big page on IG, Make sure you are posting original content, no one wants to see repeated content on all pages.Provide FREE value as much as you can : Remember, you can only grow if you are providing free value to the audience,audience will only follow you if they are getting real value which can make them smarter, happier, improve their life, get to know something new, learn something that may helps them in improving their career, earnings, better fashion tips, dress smartly, look confident etc.Relatable Content : One of the popular ways why many accounts attracts lots of audience is because they post content that the users can connect with, they feel emotional connect, similar thinking. So, try to put content that is easy to understand and people easily connected with it.Profile Optimization : Profile Picture : The first thing that any user sees whenever someone founds your content useful/interesting/entertaining is they look towards your profile picture, make sure to have a profile picture which depicts your brand, easily to read in small thumbnails if it has a text or a logo.Username : Try to keep it similar to your brand/name/business . Don\u2019t use too long usernames, keep it short and crisp. Try to avoid period or underscore in username.Bio : Bio plays an important role for every new visitor to page to whether scroll down to your page to see your content or not. Bio in points works best. First two lines of Bio are very important, you should mention what is your page is about, what type of content users will get to see in that page. Then after two lines, you can provide some additional information or Call to action, to follow your page or visit your link.Highlights : If you post stories, then you can categorize them in different highlights providing the best stories that you posted.MOST IMPORTANT TIPS : HASHTAGS : Hashtags are the most important factor for any account to get their posts reach to millions of users without spending any content. I see most of the users spend hours to create content, writing captions but hardly takes 5 minutes to choose their hashtags. You have to spend time to select them. Make sure that you are choosing hashtags related to your niche only. Don\u2019t change your hashtags in every posts, best way is to use 11\u201320 Hashtags, using same hashtags again and using 30 every time can make your account shadowbanned, don\u2019t select hashtags which have too much volume, try to use hashtags within 1 million posts, unless you have more than 10k followers, also don\u2019t use which have too low volumes. When you found hashtags which does good for you, make 3\u20134 sets of them and use them randomly on posts. The rules for hashtags don\u2019t work same on accounts, you have to figure it out what method works best for you.Users Engagement : There is no use of having thousands of followers, if your engagement rate is low. Its one of the underrated thing which most people ignore. Having a good followers engagement in your page, can really help you boost your post, have better growth and Brand Awareness. Try to interact with your followers as much you can. Reply every comment in your posts, ask them questions, Ask about their opinions, tell them to tag their friends that can be benefited from your post. Use stickers in Stories. Ask your followers to follow on Post notifications.Call To Action : Many of my clients complained that get despite getting thousand of likes, they are getting very less amount of followers or link visits or sales, this is because they don\u2019t add any Call to action in their posts or they try to use it in inappropriate way that makes them looks spammy. So, what i recommends is have a proper post caption, firstly mentions the what the post is all about or starts with asking a question, then proving value to the audience, details about the posts, minimum 2\u20133 lines. After that just simply ask them to give a follow if they want to see more of your valuable content, visit your bio link to know about you etc. REMEMBER, adding call to action is necessary to get better results, because, most of the people will just simply like your content and scroll down.Consistency : Many people complained even after following all the ways told my be they did not see any growth or get good results. When i visit their profiles, i saw that they did not have any consistency in their account. Sometimes they post in weeks, sometimes more than 5 posts in a day. This is what making your profile not ranking good. Instagram runs on smart algorithms that their developers spends years too develop and continue making changes everyday. So, the algorithms are developed in such a way that if the found users to be consistent on the platform, posting at proper timings, engaging with users, don\u2019t spam the platform, gets good results in the posts then the account automatically gets good rank in hashtags and on explore page.So, these are some of the most smartest ways to grow on Instagram at a good rate and get good amount of organic followers. My name is Umang and i have helped many users to grow their Instagram account to thousands of followers. I help people with Growing their accounts, Making strategies, Account management, content creation and getting the sales for their business. Feel free to drop me a message if you have any questions related to Instagram or get help with any of the services. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, mind the follower contract. People see your existing posts as a promise on what to expect from you in the future. If you\u2019ve posted 500 irresistible pictures of cats, and the person evaluating your profile just can\u2019t get enough irresistible cats in their feed, you\u2019ll be more likely to gain a new follower. This means that you must think about what your existing board is promising to new potential followers. (And when they start following you, you can\u2019t expect their continuous engagement if you radically or often decide to change the direction of your posts.) Now, some might say that \u201call posts are about me and my life\u201d. And that\u2019s fine if your life is interesting enough to attract new followers besides friends, family, and co-workers. Because \u201ckeeping all your ducks in a row\u201d might not be enough to compel a profile visitor to follow you. Now, some Instagram users have a huge following despite not focusing on a clear and concise niche. Celebrities are common in this category. If you want to use their Instagram strategy, then it\u2019s less about Instagram as a platform and more about figuring out a way to become famous. Others take the route of buying their followers. And buying likes on their pictures. Even buying comments from bots. But what\u2019s the point in posting pictures for a bunch of machines? And if you\u2019re only trying to impress your friends, don\u2019t bother. If you bought your followers, they\u2019ll figure it out. If not, maybe look into getting smarter friends? If your follower contract is tight, then it might be time to examine your hashtag strategy: First, look at how many likes and comments you get on average. Then, research hashtags that are relevant to your picture strategy and find tags where you can reasonably expect to have your picture visible on the tag page as one of nine top posts. For instance, if you have 50 likes on average, only use relevant hashtags where you only need 40 likes to be featured as a top post for that particular tag. If you use 30 carefully chosen hashtags and you get featured as one of nine top posts on all of them, you\u2019ll have a better chance of being discovered by people who are looking for interesting accounts to follow. If you\u2019ve taken a picture of a sunset and you get 100 likes on average, don\u2019t use the hashtag #sunset because you won\u2019t stand a chance on being featured on such a generic and common tag. As your average number of comments and likes grows, replace your hashtags for \u201cbetter\u201d ones continuously. Think of it as climbing a ladder of engagement. Now, as your gaining traction, it\u2019s not a bad idea to improve your content quality. If you don\u2019t get into this habit, you\u2019ll sooner or later hit your threshold. Despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d you might struggle to grow simply because your content isn\u2019t good enough. Next, turn your gaze towards the engagement economy. Lots of people will only follow you if you follow them back. Lots of people will only like your pictures if you, at least once in a while, like one of their pictures. The same goes for comments. Make no mistake about it: There are bots for auto-follows, auto-unfollows, auto-liking, and auto-commenting. But if you\u2019re looking to build true engagement, your engagement must be true as well. When you reach critical mass you won\u2019t be able to keep up and that\u2019s okay, but until then \u2014 engage with the community using the hashtags you\u2019re targeting. There you have it. Simple, yes. Lots of work? Yes, that too. ",

Otherwise the rest of the strategies are useless. Is the bio good? Are the last ~15 posts awesome? Is the logo good? Do they know what your page is when they land on it? Etc, etc\u2026Post daily or as often as you can (this depends what kind of account you have, it will be hard for a personal page). The more you post = more chances to be found. IG also favours active accounts in the algorithmGo to similar accounts to yours and repost their most viral content or best performing posts. If it went viral for them it\u2019s likely to go viral for youConstantly test hashtags. I use 20\u201325 hashtags per post and have 5+ sets that I rotate through. So in total I have at least 100 hashtags that I switch around and testLeave genuine comments on recent and related posts in your niche. This is very time consuming but everything helps if you\u2019re starting from 0Buy shoutouts. This is the fastest way to grow but obviously costs moneyIf you\u2019re over 2k followers do S4S with other accounts. I did 3 shout for shouts per day to get my first 100k followersFind engagement groups that leave genuine commentsMake your page better and truly unique from everyone elseCreate original content with your own logo on it. If it\u2019s good, other accounts will repost it and you get free shoutoutsConsistency, consistency, consistency. I stopped posting for a few months and lost all my momentum, even started losing followers. Keep this in mindAt my peak, I was getting 30,000 followers per month using these strategies. It takes a lot of work and consistency, especially now that IG is more competitive. Being different is more important than ever. Hope this helps! ",

This is my story of how I grew my Instagram page and how you can grow your Instagram page and achieve 100,000 followers in less than a year. Whether you're an Instagram novice or an Instagram expert, this guide and the accompanying video will help you get more Instagram followers. In the last few days of December, I set-up a page that originally was a hobby page to document my journey to financial freedom. However, over time Instagram became my answer to how I could achieve financial freedom. From hobby to side hustle to making a full-time income from Instagram, I was able to scale my Instagram page and grow my Instagram followers to the point where it produced me a full-time income. Here are some of the methods I used during various stages of my page's growth. 0-1000 Followers Going to hashtags related to my page, going to the recent tab and finding pages like mine with a similar number of followers. Then, I would like and comment on their posts, follow them and DM them so I could build real long term relationships with similar new accounts to me.Creating carousel posts rather than \"viral posts\". The first page would serve as a title page to force people to actually swipe all the way through my content. I'd end them with a slide that was a follow call to action.1000-10,000 Followers I used a special kind of shoutout called a target shoutout which I explain in more depth within the video.Doing shoutout for shoutouts with similar sized pages once a day on the feed (and maybe 2-3 on my story).I'd still post these more in-depth carousel posts to help differentiate myself.10,000-100,000 Followers I used a $5/day FB ads method to help me grow, these followers tended to follow less pages like mine than followers gained from shoutouts so the engagement rate was a little higher.Then I moved to target shoutouts and targeted pages with a high US audience to help make my page more monetizable and it was cheaper to target the USA this way, than with FB ads.I hope this helps anyone looking to grow their page on Instagram. Don't forget to check out the video that goes into how I grew to 100,000 Instagram followers in just 6 months in far more depth. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Create a clear strategy Before you begin to attract followers, determine what you want to tell them. Think about the main theme of your account and the goals you want to achieve with it. Create a content plan for the next month. 2. Investigate your competitors Find 3-5 main competitors and study them. How they attract and hold followers. What their actions and publications cause the greatest resonance of the audience. 3. Check the profile design Profile is the first and the main contact with new subscribers. Use keywords in the name and login. (These two fields are indexed in Instagram, so think about them well). Make the most of the Bio field. Specify a link to the site, if you do not have a website, then on a social network or blog. 4. Publish posts daily Accustom yourself to publish every day 1-2 posts. Thus, you will support the activity of the existing audience and recruit subscribers. Use posting on schedule to optimize the publication of content. The multifunctional InstaDao system has excellent opportunities for posting schedules. 5. Use the catchy photo Use only your photos. Take care of the image quality. Create an interest in people so that they click on the photo and read your post, and then go to the page and subscribe. 6. Add hashtags For each post, you can add up to 30 hashtags. Use not only popular hashtags, also hashtags with a more popular (more specialized), so you can go to the top easily. And still be sure to create your own unique 1-2 hashtag and add them to all publications. 7. Add geolocation Find out or think about where your target audience is and add the appropriate locations to your publications (even if the photo was taken elsewhere) 8. Use mass following and masses liking I always recommend using InstaDao. The application is connected to your account and it performs actions instead of you. For example, follows, likes, leaves comments, looks at the story.All this is done according to the tasks you have created. For example, the system processes followers of your competitor or audience by hashtag.Using the automation of activity will give you 500-1000 followers a month. For this result, $ 13 is a cheap price, i think. It was my basic advices for you. I hope it will be useful for you and somebody else too :) ",

The Instagram is linked to an online shop where you can buy some branded Not Your Girl gear and a few other items. We also used a bunch of hashtags on each post, to help the organic aspect of our growth.

Step 2: Gaining Instagram Followers \u2013 The Real Way Outside of using hashtags to tap into our potential audience, we followed pretty much Best practices for gaining followers the usual way. We looked at accounts that had a similar aesthetic to Not Your Girl, and went into their followers. We then followed some of their followers and liked some of their posts.  Those users then saw that we had engaged with them, and hopefully followed us back. We didn\u2019t go in and comment on posts or DM any of the people we followed, because we wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep that consistent with our bot. Step 3: Gaining Instagram Followers \u2013 The Bot Way We temporarily stopped gathering new followers and posting before we switched over to buying followers. This gave us a nice clean break when we went back to look at our results \u2014 there is no overlap at all between our bot results and our human results.  There are a lot of bots and services out there you can use to buy followers on Instagram. These types of services are abundant, and often seem pretty fake.

The images that you use should be copyright free .Post regularly - Regular posting actually helps you to reach you potential followers . Try to understand why would someone follow you if you are not give value to them .Use tags - Although Instagram allows you to use 30 tags , don't use more than 7\u20138 tags coz insta algorithm will consider it a spam which is definitely not good for your growth . Out of 7\u20138 tags ( or max 10) the correct proportion would be -1 tag with more than 10 million user2\u20133 tag with more than 100k user3\u20134 tag with 10 k userUse cities I your tags like New York, delhi or specific places like Manhattan , Times square.Pro tip- Don't make your insta account on travel , food or dogs as there are thousands of insta accounts on them competing for same audiences , Ex - if you want to make a traveling account make it country specific like Switzerland_destination, florida_fervor or India_vacation .

            "answer_text": "There are several rules you must observe to get more followers on Instagram. A. One is using hashtags. A lot of people take hashtags for granted and and look over using them. But the fact is that hashtags are created to get your posts seen on the explore of Instagram. In 2018, Instagram allowed a maximum of 30 hashtags on each pots. You\u2019d better use all 30 hashtags on each post so you will be visited and reached for more key phrases in search of Instagram. B. Another thing you must consider is scheduling your posts. You must post regularly and on a hourly/daily/weekly\u2026 basis. so that Instagram has a clue of when to crawl into your profile and bring your new contents out to be visible to the Explore. Plus, your audience know exactly when to await your contents. C. Add value to your followers. Only when a content is valuable people want to follow you to get more of that kind. By \u201cvaluable\u201d I mean anything that your audience is interested in. Some people might be interested in astrology, so if your Instagram account is adding value in this field to them, then they will follow you. Some people look for added value in reading \u201cyellow pages\u201d. So there is no difference. All you need to do is to find your niche, know your audience and give them what they want. D. You can automate your Instagram. Sometimes life gets too busy and you won\u2019t have time to spend time \u201cvirtually\u201d. Then an Instagram automation too (aka Instagram bot) might do you good. But look out for scam bots which might get your account banned. Study and research well before you choose one. A good and trusted automation tool must safe your account by observing all Instagram limitation and rules. E. Post stories and go live. This is what your followers will love most. People like to be invited to you most intimate and private moments and they will identify with you are a photographer, post a story or go on a live about the behind the scene of of your most popular works. This gives your audience a sense of being one with you. Wish you best of most active followers on Instagram\u2026 ;) ",

            "answer_text": "#1. Join Instagram Engagement Groups Are you just starting to learn how to get followers on Instagram? This tactic is best for beginners. Some Instagram newbies have seen their Instagram followers increase fast. What did they do differently? They joined engagement groups. engagement groups to gain followers on Instagram While it can be tempting to join the biggest Instagram engagement groups, truth is you\u2019ll get a more targeted list of Instagram followers by sticking to your niche. You can find engagement groups for travel, beauty, fashion and more. In these groups, you can get followers and likes from people who have shared interests. But if you\u2019re serious about getting the attention, you should also return the favor by following fan pages for people who join the group. I\u2019ve had friends get 2,000 new followers in only a couple weeks using this strategy. While it might not help with immediate sales, it helps you gain credibility early on so your Instagram page doesn\u2019t show that you only have 38 followers. This is more of a short-term strategy for your first few weeks on Instagram not a long-term one for getting Instagram followers. #2. Repost Others\u2019 Content When I was building my store\u2019s Instagram account, my entire posting strategy revolved around reposting other people\u2019s content. The only way to do this without getting flagged is to credit the original poster in your description, every time. Instagram has now updated their policy and you\u2019re required to ask for permission before reposting. When I first started, I\u2019d take screenshots and add the pictures to my Instagram. What really helped my page take off was the Repost app. It allowed me to start reposting video content on Instagram. One of the biggest home runs I had was when I re-posted a video that amassed 52,862 views, got 1264 comments and 9,147 likes. At the time, I didn\u2019t even have 10,000 followers so this was a big freaking deal. how to get followers on instagram with reposting Why\u2019d I repost other people\u2019s content instead of posting my own? Because I knew that it was easier to repost content. Plus, my visual and video content would never be as good as someone else\u2019s. Hey, at least I\u2019m honest about it! How did I know what to repost? I\u2019d look at the numbers. I was pretty active on Instagram so I\u2019d browse the list of hashtags I came up with and used daily to find the top performing posts that weren\u2019t posted by other fan pages (so not my competitors) but by individual people. I\u2019d then watch the videos and look at the pictures to see which ones I had the biggest reactions to. If I felt the urge to share someone else\u2019s post, I knew I had to repost it onto my page. So if you\u2019re just learning how to get followers on Instagram, this high-impact strategy is simple enough for a beginner. (You can use Instaberry to help you do this automatically) #3. Ask Customers to Share their Photos When you\u2019re just starting out, getting followers on Instagram will be a lot easier with customer photos in your feed. Why? It can help increase social proof. more followers on instagram If you\u2019ve never had a customer before, reach out to influencers in your niche with under 5,000 followers. I know the number seems low but influencers with few followers on Instagram want to monetize their accounts and will be willing to take pictures with your products at a much lower rate. You can also offer them an affiliate deal where they\u2019ll get a commission for every sale they score with their customer referral link. If you\u2019ve already had a couple of sales, reach out to customers and offer a free gift or cash incentive for taking quality images with the product they purchased. Offering incentives isn\u2019t going to be your long-term strategy but for the short-term while you try to build your brand, this can help you grow. As more customers start seeing customer photos on your Instagram, they\u2019ll naturally start tagging you in posts when they receive their products. If you comment on their post, repost the content and follow them you\u2019ll likely get them to follow back. Though some will follow you after tagging you in their post on their own. #4. Have a consistent style that hooks people in I know this sounds like one of those \u2018blah, blah, blah\u2019 ways to gain followers on Instagram. But it isn\u2019t. Here\u2019s why: people don\u2019t follow you because of the content you\u2019ve posted but because of what they think the future content you\u2019ll post will be like. Say you have a corgi fan page, every day you post cute corgi pictures and videos without fail. If Instagram users keep seeing your posts eventually they\u2019ll realize that you always post the cutest corgi content. So they follow you with the expectation that your account will always be more of the same type of content. Having a consistent style or theme is more than just a branding play, it\u2019s about creating an expectation for your Instagram account that your followers or potential followers can count on. They want to see more of the same type of content, every day. If you can deliver that consistency with every post, you\u2019ll grow your followers on Instagram at a faster rate over time. #5. Ignore the Hashtag Rules Many experts will tell you to only use 5 or 11 hashtags or some other arbitrary numbers. But when I was building my store\u2019s Instagram account, I ignored their advice and ran wild with it. I\u2019d copy and paste a list of hashtags from my phone onto my app. Then, I\u2019d sometimes switch it up to try different hashtags but eventually, I knew which ones usually worked best. Usually, I\u2019d go as close to or right to the max number of hashtags possible. 30. That\u2019s the magic number. Truth is, you add all those hashtags in the first comment. And as your page engagement grows, no one will ever see the first comment because they\u2019re too busy tagging their friend in your post. Sure, when you\u2019re starting out people might see it. But if the goal is to increase visibility, the easiest way to do it is to add more hashtags. As you gain followers, your posts will rank higher for those hashtag keywords giving you even more visibility. If your hashtags are niche specific, you\u2019ll increase your likelihood of being found by a relevant audience which will help you grow your followers on Instagram as well. So avoid generic hashtags like #love or #picoftheday if you\u2019re selling fashion, for example. ",

Get your Instagram Account Promoted on Buzzfeed To get that Instagram followers boost, you need to find a way to tap into a massive audience. And no one embeds Instagram posts into their content as much as Buzzfeed. A Buzzfeed staff member wrote an article about how she grew her personal brand as an Instagram influencer. She currently has almost 6,000 followers but the article she wrote on the platform might\u2019ve helped. Buzzfeed does have a Community section where anyone can post their own content onto their platform, though you\u2019ll need to follow their guidelines to build trust and to get visibility. Is Buzzfeed not right for your niche? That\u2019s cool. You can also use a tool called HARO where you get emails three times a day filled with requests from reporters who are looking to get content and expert quotes for their stories. Most allow a website link and social links. So you can hit two birds with one stone by getting a link to your store and Instagram account. #4. Ask Customers to Share their Photos When you\u2019re just starting out, getting followers on Instagram will be a lot easier with customer photos in your feed. Why? It can help increase social proof.

            "answer_text": "First the most important: post quality pictures, this is the base for everything. If your content isn\u2019t good enough, you won\u2019t get those likes which are needed for reach and followers. Be consistent with your feed and activity. Create a cohesive feed, Instagram is a highly visual place. Post regularly but find a pace that works for you. Don\u2019t try to post more often if your content quality suffers. Create good captions, make people want to comment your posts. You also need comments for reach and followers. Be active: like and comment other accounts you like yourself. DON\u2019T follow others in hopes of getting them to follow you back. Most of them won\u2019t follow you back and you\u2019ll end up following many unneccesary accounts and this will backfire in the future. Follow the ones you truly like and concentrate on engaging with them. Follow/unfollow is the ultimate worst option. Ask for story exchange from accounts similar to yours. Ask if they\u2019d like to share your account in their stories and then you\u2019ll share them too. Most of the people are open for story exchange. This will give you some extra exposure easily. Then you only need to be patient. Growth doesn\u2019t come fast in the beginning and the real fast growth starts after 3\u20135k if your account is optimised for growth. You get fast results with inorganic tactics but in long term these tactics will make it hard or even impossible to grow organically later. When you go all organic it\u2019s possible to gain 100\u2013500 followers per day constantly. ",

First of all be smart in picking the ways to gain more followers on Instagram. Post consistently According to Tailwind, a profile that posted 7 or more times a week will get more likes and followers faster than a profile that post less frequently. With Instagram\u2019s algorithmic timeline, consistency is the key to get your post seen by many audience and appear on top of the feeds. You daily audiences might end up be your new followers. Cross-promote your dedicated hashtag Use dedicated hashtags when it comes to Instagram caption ideas. Be more creative in that parts as it plays a huge role in gaining attention of the audiences. It might be a starting point to spark an interest to your daily audiences. Choose hashtag that seem to be optimal in number of getting maximum engagements and exposure. Participate in massively popular conversations Instagram is very much a community, and one great way to get involved in that community is by engaging with them in conversations.

Run a contest and then ask people to follow your account and Like or comment on the photo in order to enter the contest. You can try add a UGC (User-Generated Content) element to the contest whereby they need to post a photo of their own and use a specific hashtag along with following your account.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think anyone with any social media knowledge would say that you can increase your following (without buying followers) without having good, high-quality content. This means staying on topic (so if your account is about food or sports, don\u2019t share an outfit of the day post or pictures from your birthday party. Additionally, while instagram began as a place to share your iphone photos after sprucing them up with filters, the vast majority of accounts with large followings are sharing images that are professionally taken with DSLR cameras and edited in photoshop or lightroom. People are beginning to expect magazine-quality images that are eye catching, well-lit, and have good composition. Take an objective look at your grid, and ask yourself - \u201cWould I follow me?\u201d If the answer is no, take some time to figure out why, and delete any images from your feed or highlights that don\u2019t meet your standards. Another way to encourage people to follow you is engagement. It is, after all, called SOCIAL media. Make sure you\u2019re replying to all comments. Ask questions in your captions to encourage others to comment. Make it a dialogue more often than simply putting out content. This works in your favor for multiple reasons, as you can get information about what content people like, use it for research if you\u2019re offering products or services, and get yourself featured on the \u201cexplore\u201d page if you have enough engagement quickly enough for the instagram algorithm to feature you. That last benefit is why many people start or join instagram engagement pods, which are groups of people who support each other by liking and commenting on each other\u2019s content in hopes of getting featured on the explore page. Some say that engaging in all of Instagram\u2019s features make it more likely to have your content shown on the explore page. So if you\u2019re not already using stories, IGTV, and instagram live, I\u2019d recommend you do so! Other ways to get people to discover you are to make sure that you are tagging the locations of your posts, both in stories and in your grid. This way, other people looking at those locations can find your post, and if they like what they see, they may follow you. You can also use hashtags to help other people discover you. You can use up to 30 hashtags at a time. I would use a mix of relatively popular hashtags and more niche-focused. My strategy is to use the same set of hashtags for about half of my 30 on every post, and then to add some that are specific to that picture topic and/or caption. Hashtags work in the grid, but they can also help people discover you in instagram stories, so use them there, too! You can even shrink the hashtags down and hide them so it doesn\u2019t clutter your story image. A great way to start bringing people to your page is to go to theirs and start a conversation. There are some bots that will do this for you, however I caution you to avoid that, as I\u2019ve seen auto-comments be wildly inappropriate and offensive at times. For example, I\u2019ve seen tribute posts to a family member passing away where a bot comments \u201cAwesome shot!\u201d - yikes! So cringey! It\u2019s much better to take the time to go to the accounts of potential fans (for example, the people commenting on larger accounts in your niche, or your competitor\u2019s accounts), and liking a few of their pictures and leaving a genuine comment on a post or two of theirs! Another way to get more attention to your account is to ask your current following to tag people on your posts. For example, \u201cTag a friend who would think this is funny\u201d or \u201ctag someone who has been a great friend to you\u201d etc. You can also sweeten the pot by doing a giveaway related to your account\u2019s topic, requiring people to follow you to enter, with bonus entries for tagging friends, reposting your content, or sharing it to their stories. This, however, is not always the best strategy because sometimes people follow just until the giveaway ends and unfollow, or even go as far as making accounts solely for giveaways. Some people follow tons of people at a time, wait a few days, and unfollow (whether the person follows back or not). I don\u2019t recommend this, because I think on the receiving end, it is annoying. Many people frown upon it and I\u2019ve seen people complain about it. It may work, but I don\u2019t consider it a best practice personally. Overall, nothing beats having high-quality content and relationship-building, but a good hashtag strategy and outreach go a long way to boost a following as well! I hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "More powerful tips to get instagram followers instant : Here are some effective tips get more instagram engagement  Post consistently (at least once a day):- Visual marketing tool Tailwind studied more than 100,000 Instagram profiles in 2017 to understand how posting frequency affects follower growth and engagement rate. They found that the more often you post, the more likes and followers you get. According to the study, profiles that posted seven or more times a week (or at least once a day) get more likes and gain more followers faster than those that post less frequently. Try live videos, and Stories:- While Instagram started as a photo-sharing network, it has grown beyond just photos. With features like videos, live videos, and Stories, brands can now create many different types of content to engage their fans and grow their following. Here are a few compelling reasons to try posting these new content types: The average engagement for videos is growing faster than the average engagement for images3 Get creative with hashtagging:- When it comes to Instagram caption ideas, you need to look beyond the one-word, obvious hashtags. Sure, you want to use those, too, but mix it up and use hashtags to tell part of your story. Be funny, ironic, or outrageous--just don't be BORING. Collaborative workspace company WeWork is great at this, and they include a fun mix of Instagram content. * .Write an Engaging Bio: While posts are likely the first thing potential followers will see, your profile helps provide valuable information about your brand or connect with your audience. There are a few options you can go with, like Away\u2019s simple \u201cThoughtful standards for modern travel\u201d tagline. Or, you might include a more casual bio, Post at your best times:- After looking at more than five studies on the best times to post, I learned that there isn\u2019t a universal best time to post on Instagram. Instead, every brand has its own best times to post. You have yours, too! Timeliness of a post is one of the major factors in the Instagram Insights Followers Alternatively, you can use Instagram analytics tools like Iconosquare or Buffer for Business to find your best time to post using your Instagram data. This is especially helpful if you don\u2019t have a business profile on Instagram and, thereby, no access to Instagram Insights. Here\u2019s how the Iconosquare feature looks like: ",

            "answer_text": "Seven things to have in mind when growing followers on Instagram: 1. Put an accent to the attractiveness of your posts. Put yourself in a position of a typical IG user; you\u2019ll stop scrolling only when you see an image or a video that looks interesting enough. Regardless of the type of the content you post, you have to make sure that your posts intrigue your audience. So, focus on the quality of your content, because that\u2019s how Instagram works. 2. Instagram\u2019s algorithm favors the accounts that are active, i.e. that post often enough. In order to receive more followers and get more engagement, you should post every day if possible (but not too much, since some people will become annoyed if they see tons of posts by the same profile every time they log in to IG). 3-4 posts daily should do the work. 3. Some of the most popular (and the most profitable) topics or niches are: fitness, health, dating & relationships, self-improvement, pets, how to make money online, etc. If you fall into the some of the mentioned categories, chances are that you will gain more followers. 4. Look for the profiles (who post similar stuff as you) that have the most engagement (likes & comments) and the most followers, and see which hashtags they use. Now use those hashtags in your posts. Also, don\u2019t forget that the hashtags shouldn\u2019t be too general, but more specific. If you use very popular hashtags you won\u2019t be noticed, since thousands (or millions) of people are posting using the same ones. 5. Engage with the posts from other profiles you see on Instagram\u2019s explore page, regardless of whether they follow you or not. Like & comment on them. This also improves your visibility, and increases the chances for you to get noticed. 6. If you have a blog, a Facebook page, or a business website, put the link to your Instagram profile in all those places to increase traffic to your profile. 7. There are many online platforms that actually sell likes and comments, but the vast majority of them is useless since that kind of engagement is usually coming from fake accounts. If you could get numerous likes or comments from accounts that are real and active on Instagram, then you\u2019re on the right path. Instead of purchasing fake likes and generic comments (which Instagram doesn\u2019t like, so it can be harmful to your profile), the service called Fuelgram can provide you with a large number of real likes and comments coming from influential Instagram profiles. Since there you can also select an appropriate niche/topic (photography, lifestyle, travel, fashion), and buy likes coming from the accounts belonging to that particular niche, you will rapidly improve your post reach and engagement, which will get you more relevant followers organically.

            "answer_text": "1. Optimize your Instagram account Before you set out figuring out how to gain followers on Instagram, one of the most important steps is to have your account fully optimized. Think of your brand\u2019s Instagram bio as the \u201chomepage\u201d to your account. 2. Keep a consistent content calendar The worst thing you can do when trying to get followers on Instagram is to post content at random, haphazard times. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get users following you in the beginning, you don\u2019t want to make them forget they followed you in the first place. 3. Schedule Instagram posts in advance While the Instagram algorithm has changed to show users more content they like, posting at the right times can still give your posts more visibility by increasing the overall engagement they receive. 4. Get partners and brand advocates to post your content When you\u2019re learning how to get more Instagram followers, it\u2019s important to know the value of your audience. The larger your follower count grows (organically), the more buyers and interested customers you will have. 5. Avoid fake Instagram followers There\u2019s a huge difference between an Instagram account having fake and legitimate followers. It might seem tempting to simply purchase Instagram followers, but the backlash outweighs the perks of organic follower growth. 6. Showcase your Instagram everywhere How are people going to find an account unless you promote your Instagram? Make sure your Instagram account is listed with your website and other social networks. 7. Post content followers want While this is easier said than done, it\u2019s smart to learn what content your followers want to see. You\u2019ll quickly find on Instagram that some content performs better than others. This is why testing is so important. 8. Get the conversation started One of the best ways to make users aware of your Instagram is through conversation. According to the 2020 Sprout Social Index, consumers want to engage with visual-first content like photos (68%) and video (50%), followed by 30% who want to engage with text posts. Instagram is the perfect fit for this audience profile, pairing eye-catching visuals with captions that can be just as engaging when you perfect your Instagram caption copywriting skills. 9. Find hashtags that convert One of the most tried-and-true ways to get followers on Instagram is through hashtags. For years hashtags have served as an essential tool for discovery and allowed us to extend our social reach. As a marketer, you want to build your community by gaining followers and hashtags provide just that. 1o. Make your Instagram followers happy Last but not least, when you make your Instagram followers happy, you see the payoff in audience growth. We\u2019ve given you plenty of tips for brainstorming and scheduling content, so put them into practice in a way that feels real to your brand voice. In other words, avoid seeming needy, sales-driven or robotic. ",

            "answer_text": "What I love about Instagram is the community you can find and create. If you want to get more Instagram followers, there are many ways to do it, but they are not all equal. Some people choose to buy followers. I do not recommend this. To outside people checking out your account for the first time, that can make it look like you\u2019re getting a lot of traction on your posts. In reality, your individual photos won\u2019t have a lot of engagement, nor will it be authentic and community-building. Start by following people who are interested in the same things as you (fashion, food, travel, etc.) and like and comment on their posts. Don\u2019t spam them with emojis, but give positive feedback or encouragement. You can search for photos from a particular place, so find people who are posting from your city. I\u2019ve met a few awesome people this way, and have then been followed by Instagrammers whom I admire and who have lots of great content (as well as a lot of followers). Spend time taking good-quality photos and use an editing app like A Color Story (my favorite) or VSCO cam. Make sure your photos are bright and sharp. Over time, keep a consistent theme on your feed. Your top 9 photos will be the first thing someone sees when they come to your page, and it will look a lot better if you have a color scheme or use the same editing techniques on each photo. Be genuine, share what you\u2019re passionate about. It\u2019s better to work on making your little corner of the internet fun and reflective of you than get a bunch of followers. Don\u2019t get discouraged by slow growth. Make it for you. EDIT: P.S. hashtags are also a good way for people to find your photos. You can add a comment to a photo after you\u2019ve posted it with hashtags that are relevant to your content. Use area specific hashtags (like #texasig) or community based hashtags (like #myunicornlife). Use hashtags that have less posts so there\u2019s less competition, and don\u2019t get too general (like #love). ",

            "answer_text": "This is an all-too-common question here on Quora and other places. While there may be different tricks you can do to boost your followers, if you truly want to boost your account, it takes more than tricks. The amount of followers, while impressive, doesn\u2019t matter as much as your actual engagement. Of course, if you have 1,000,000 followers, it\u2019s a high likelihood you\u2019ll have a few thousand interactions. However, you\u2019re better off with 10,000 followers and 9,000 engaged, than 1,000,000 and 10,000 engaged. If you have a smaller audience that is more engaged, it means you have a more loyal following. You are able to remain more personal and provide better service. Of course, let\u2019s talk about how to increase followers and not by purchasing or cheating it. First you want solid content; consistent solid content. You want to make sure you\u2019re improving up on the content as well. Let people come along the journey. Now, we move back to the engagement part. I know I\u2019ve already covered engagement, if I haven\u2019t said engagement enough, I\u2019ll say it again, engagement. I\u2019m sure by now, this may seem like a bit of work to some and they\u2019ve already scrolled or moved on, but if you\u2019re still here, you understand its importance. It\u2019s building relationships, it is building a friendship/relationship with your audience. I\u2019m not talking about BBQs with your audience, though that could be cool, or different outings, but talking to your audience and connecting is a key point in building up a relationship. These relationships lead to support and collaborative efforts. The other night I was able to do some behind-the-scene photography onset of some films. It was my relationship with one person, and it has lead to a relationship with others I can work with. As I continue to grow my relationship with the different people and the people they introduce me to, I\u2019ll continue to be asked to do more work. Not only will I share the content I do for them, they will share my content and tag their friends. Also, through this process, I\u2019ll improve upon what I do and this can lead to more engagement as the content is shared, talked about, laughed about, and enjoyed. ",

            "answer_text": "ty4ta2a How do I get more followers on Instagram? With all social media the rules of success are fairly simple to state but they are all hinged on the single capricious luck of the dice being as one can do all the right things and yet still not have much of an effect, or conversely can be an alienating prick with thin content quality and still somehow capture some kitch quality that draws others to you. Barring an extreme demonstration of either good or bad luck, here are a few ways: Produce really good content.Champion a causerepresent an under represented group (similar to #2)Do something outside of Instagram which brings enough recognition that your name attached to an account gets you constant inquiry.Provide something that makes the life of the audience better for having received it.Network with others to create a pool audience to promote one another toBe whatever you are representing consistently and completelyHave the detachment to self promoteDont let #8 affect you contentFollow massive amounts of other people. A percentage of them will feel obligated to in turn follow you.Give meaningful feedback on the works of others.Specialize on something and cater to a crowd who enjoys that specializationThese are vague intentionally as they are not content specific. Take #4 for example: what you do could be a skill such a skydive in a wingsuit, a controversy like throwing your shoe at the president, or an accomplishment like winning a marathon, or an obscure occupation like biowaste cleanup specialist or an envied one like NFL Player or model. The specifics are irrelevant to the principles. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s lots of advice here explaining what you should do, so I\u2019ll give you one thing you shouldn\u2019t do: Don\u2019t use any bots or software to buy followers. Here\u2019s why: None of the followers you buy will interact or engage with you. Hardly any likes, no comments, and no valuable contributions.Your real followers will be able to tell. This reduces your credibility and makes you seem even less popular than before.You might be thinking, \u201cwhy not just buy likes and comments too?\u201d It\u2019s a pretty easy way to boost your posts, right? No. This will create a cycle where you\u2019re forced to buy more likes/comments on every post. If you stop, it\u2019ll be obvious the previous posts were boosted. The engagement you pay for through bots won\u2019t provide genuine value. The comments will usually be generic lines like \u201cgreat post!\u201d or thumbs up emojis \u2014 not real feedback. Here are statistics from a 4-month case study AdEspresso ran comparing real Instagram results to bot-run results (spending 100$ per month):  The real method (left) captured more than 3x as many visitors to the online store as the bot method (right). The bot method performed worse in visitors, sales, and engagement. The best way to gain real followers is to post more and increase the quality of your posts. Create a unique style that people will remember you by. Interact with other accounts and leave meaningful comments. Host giveaways and contests. Don\u2019t buy followers. ",

            "answer_text": "A-Neglect what follower sellers tell you. Never buy fake followers. 1-Instagram and also Facebook has developed an algorithm to differentiate between fake and real followers. Facebook did it a few years ago and in one night most of the pages lost lost thousands of this fake followers :) On instagram, if you have fake followers your posts will not be at the \u2018\u2019top post\u2019\u2019 section since the algorithm measures percentage of engagement, not the amount of followers you have. If you are posting interesting content for your audience, you can be still featured at top section (with less than thousand followers) which will bring you exposure and followers. 2- Avarage Instagram user can understand which accounts have fake followers and which doesnt have. How? An account with 10k follower can not have 100 likes and 2 comments per post :) I dont know why you want followers but lets say if you are doing it 4 the sake of r brand, think about what will your real followers think about you when they find out that you bought fake followers. They can easily think that you are a fraud, they will not trust you and wont buy your service or product. B-Engagement will bring you followers. 1- For engagement, post original, interesting content. Give reason to people to follow you. 2- 2 posts per day is really enough. Dont post more than 3 content. 3-Plan your posts before you post them. Later is a good and free app 4 that. The posts in your gallery should be both individually interesting and/or beautiful and be interesting and/or beautiful all together. New follower candidates will look at your gallery before they decide.Think holistic! 4- Engage with your audience. Keep this in mind: \u2018you can not get without giving\u2019. If you engage with them, they will engage with you. Engage with your potential audience also! It is not TV, it is social media. So interaction is a must! C-Use niche hashtags. Common hashtags like paris have millions of posts and it is impossible to be a top post. Moreover it is very hard to be noticed by someone there. D- Most importantly, you or your service or your product should be original if you want to have more than 10k followers. If there is nothing special, think about it and invent one :) There are millions of insta accounts producing excessive content and most of them are very similar. If you can create original content, sooner or later you will be noticed! ",

            "answer_text": " You have an Instagram account, you\u2019re posting regularly, you use #hashtags. Yet, no new followers are coming your way. I know how frustrating this can be, especially when you\u2019re working hard to build a solid personal brand and hope to eventually leverage your Instagram account to earn extra cash. There\u2019s no need to despair, however. There are several tactics you can use to boost engagement and build a larger following. First off, make sure you actually understand the basics. Yes, Instagram is fun to use, but if you\u2019re struggling with follower count and want to do better, you need to take time to figure out what really works on Instagram and what doesn\u2019t. There are several comprehensive online resources available. Once you\u2019ve got the basics covered, direct your attention towards ways in which you can improve your Instagram activity and reach a wider audience.  Make sure your profile looks good as a whole Creating amazing individuals Instagram posts is the first step towards grabbing someone\u2019s attention. Beyond that, though, you need to be mindful of how your profile looks overall. Your feed should have a cohesive look, as it\u2019s the first thing a potential users sees when clicking on your username. This entails having a captivating profile photo, an engaging bio, a well-curated feed, and coordinating cover photos for your Instagram highlights. It sounds like a lot of work, but it\u2019s worth it in the long run. Up your Instagram Stories game Stories generally have better engagement than posts, so you can use them to grab attention, share more about yourself, and reach a bigger audience: Consider using templates to make sure your stories look as good as possible;Use hashtags and Location tags - Instagram geo-locations and hashtags have their own stories attached to them, which are accessible to more people;Get creative and take advantage of all the editing features available on Insta stories \u2013 polls, questions, gifs, and so on.Write better captions A picture may be worth a thousand words, but when it comes to Instagram captions are just as important. Practice until you find your Instagram voice. It can feel weird at first, but you\u2019ll eventually get better. You can use captions to describe the pictures in details, offer behind-the-scenes information, share more about your personal life. Additionally, ask your followers questions! This will offer them a prompt to comment and help you start a conversation. Cross-promote your Instagram account Think about any other marketing channels you can use to promote your Instagram to reach more people. Maybe you have a YouTube channel? Twitter account? Newsletter? Lead your existing followers from there to your Instagram page. You can even include your Instagram handle in your email signature. Collaborate with others Whenever possible, reach out to like-minded Instagram users and see if there are any ways in which you can team up. Maybe you can host a giveaway together? Work on a project that would benefit you both \u2013 like taking part in a challenge? If you\u2019re shy about reaching out, consider interacting with more influencers in your niche by commenting on their photos/stories. Turn on notifications and make sure you comment with something relevant when they post something new. That way, the people who comment after you may click on your profile if they find your words inspiring or helpful. Invest in your account While you might not be willing to invest in promoted posts if you\u2019re using Instagram as a hobby, it\u2019s worth looking into ads when you want to bring things to the next level. Instagram is very competitive and ads can help you stand out from the crowd. You don\u2019t even need to have a hefty budget as long as you learn how to effectively target your ads to the right people. There are different types of Instagram ads available, from feed-style images to promoted Instagram Stories. You just need to figure out which one is right for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I wont make this answer very long so that you are able to gain much in a limited amount of time and not lose interest. So here are few tips to organically increase your followers :- Start using hashtags, as Instagram allows you to use 30 hashtags per post but it is advisable that you use a bit less. The hashtags should be relevant to your post and try using different hashtags for every post. You can always check which hashtag works more for you by comparing the engagement in different posts.Follow different Instagram profiles related to your business or interest. You should ideally follow 30 profiles per hour and it\u2019ll definitely yield a 20\u201330% follow back.Keep liking other\u2019s pictures and try leaving a cheerful comment on their pics. This will help in making them visit your profile and maybe return the favor.Post good quality pictures. The better the post, the more engagement it will generate.Try using hashtags like \u201clikeforlike\u201d , \u201cfollowforfollow\u201d , \u201cgaintrain\u201d etc.Use hashtags even in your stories. Instagram stories have proven to be a great success and have wide reach. You can definitely use stories along with location filters to reach more people from within your location.Post about 2\u20133 times a day, not more than that.Consistency is the key, post regularly and avoid giving long gaps (weeks) between posts.Try engaging more people by having CTA ( call to action) on your posts. For eg :- asking them to tag xyz, using the Poll feature of Instagram.Hope this helps. If you need more information, do let me know. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "I will make this short, and I will make this quick. There is only one way to do so get more followers on Instagram: Quality Content. I\u2019ll break this down. Fun Fact: The first photo on Instagram was shared by co-founder Kevin Systrom of his wife\u2019s foot and a dog in July 2010. Instagram is today the world\u2019s largest photo sharing up, and you know what they say about pictures right? It is worth a thousand words. Ever since Facebook acquired Instagram, it has only grown. You can share pictures, from right where you are with your friends, have your own pictorial blog space, and in recent times, you can go LIVE on video and post stories. Not only that, you can follow celebrities, see what they are doing and get the sense of actually knowing them. It is a world in its own. Instagram has attracted tons of marketers and influencers, and wherever there are marketers and influencers, there is always a need to have a large audience base online, whether it is for yourself or the businesses you are working with. Now, how to do you get a following? You look around, and it seems relatively straightforward at times, while at other times, it seems impossible. Here is my process of creating Instagram pages which gain high volumes of traffic and likes. #1. START A PAGE ABOUT WHAT YOU LOVE. I understand if a lot of your decisions would be driven by the need for money, trends you see around and trying to replicate what 500 other profiles are doing. There is nothing wrong in that. Similar ideas in the digital world can co-exist but can only sustain via passion. Let\u2019s say you are a Digital Marketing Professional and you know you can sit and talk about it for hours. Well, that is a great niche to be in. There are two reasons to start with what you love. You will remain active for longerIt would not feel like a chore#2. QUALITY REALLY MATTERS If you keep the quality high of your content, know that you have set yourself apart by 50% already. This quality is not just about good content, but unusual context too. Be informative and very very visually appealing. You will understand the difference over time, but to start, be sure your content is on point. #3. AUTHENTICITY People want authenticity. They want to be able to resonate with someone who is a lot like them. It brings in a lot of warmth. Half of the people we follow on Instagram is because yes, they are famous, but they are just like us. They think the same things; they spend their day the same way. Adding value to someone's life is all you need to focus on. Look at Gary Vaynerchuk; the guy has motivated so many people to bring the best out in themselves, only because he tells you what no one else would, and you love it. #4. HASHTAGS This is important. Platforms like Triberr allow you to know which hashtags are banned and which aren\u2019t. A lot of the fashion hashtags get scrutinized for no reason, so, be sure to use such tools. Usually, I tend to use up to 25-30 keywords per post. Opt for keywords which have posted, under a million. Anything over, you are sliming your chances, unless, you already have 200K followers. #5. FIND A COMMUNITY Whichever industry you are targeting, at least one other person is in it. Follow up and see if the situation allows you to work on s4s (share for share) basis. This will get you and the community member more exposure. #6. STORIES ARE AMAZING A lot of the major influencers on Instagram, do not want to disrupt their newsfeed with content which does not entirely resonate with their content strategy. However, some so many famous people have zero issues with reposting your story. Feature Each > Tag Them > Follow Up #7. ENGAGEMENT Ah, the most underestimated strategic move which many still find to be useless. Assuming that I visit your profile and comment, \u2018Your Feed is Amazing.\u2019 Have the courtesy to respond! In a minute, day, week, month or year, respond! #8. CONSISTENCY Finally, the last bit in the puzzle. If you have 1,000 followers on Instagram, and you become inactive, you are certainly going to see a decrease in your following. This is because people tend to follow you for a reason, which is content and if they don\u2019t see regular updates, they don\u2019t want to support you. Post at least three times a day, seven days a week, and you will see change. Instagram is not magic, and you are not a celebrity, yet. It takes time. Put in the effort. You\u2019ll be fine. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay so you want more Followers! Good If you think that if you have million of follower on your account then your account will be verified than maybe you are wrong. I assure you that if you buy followers than 99% Will be fake accounts, it\u2019s true that they will don\u2019t un-follow you but also they do not like any of your pic! Maybe rest 1% accounts will be real but believe me if they see your pic in their feed they will un-follow you at the same moment! LET\u2019S CONSIDER ANOTHER FACT: If you have 50K followers and only 60 likeS on your pic that\u2019s also not a good thing. Now you have to get Likes on your photos manually. And it\u2019s all waste of time. We all are not using Social site in a right way, Instagram & Facebook are made to share over happy & sad moment with our friends in a better way. They are made for entertainment. But we think it\u2019s all about likes,comments,followers. NO. if you had 100 followers and only 30 likes on your pics than that\u2019s not bad. Atleast you know all of them. They are real. I suggest you that if you didn\u2019t have a Business Account, then use it in Private mode.Use suitable hashtags it will give a real followers and believe me they will like each of your pics and also share them. If you want to famous by any Social Site then according to me YOUTUBE is right option for you. ",

Ill lay out the main points most im sure you have all read: Organized quality posts that make sense for your industryYour own content not the same stuff that people have seen (even if you dont think so, if its not yours its probs everywhere)Use the slide feature where you post several photos at once because this gets people to click and slide through and that metric is importantMake content that has either very little or a ton to look at, the human brain focuses in on this, stick to this as kinda sub themego into google and type in keywords that people may look up on IG and when the \u201csuggestions\u201d pop up write all of them down and use those words in your tagsWrite full descriptions not just spamUse lesser popular tags as your first tags then as you add more get more popular (but focus on the less main ones because they are easier to rank) - This tip is for newer accounts when you first get going (under 20k followers)Work with other pages, tag, and repost othersPost at least twice a week minimumCurrently about to start working on an IG for this account so if you see this post in a month or more from now check out www.theinsurancedictionary.com ",

            "answer_text": "Growing your account on Instagram is both difficult and time consuming, but with enough diligent effort you can inevitably grow your account steadily over time. Here\u2019s what I think you can do to grow your account without Hashtags (although I feel they are quite important to IG growth). First this is what not to do; Don\u2019t use Follow/Unfollow. I know.. I\u2019m going against what a lot of people say but hear me out. This method was great 3\u20134 years ago, before Instagram had such a sophisticated algorithm. Now it\u2019s almost inevitable your account will be labeled as a spam account. IG\u2019s system categorizes accounts based on 3 criteria; Spam, User, Influencer. If you\u2019re following and unfollowing 300, 400, 500 accounts a day, then the system realizes that this is not \u201cnormal\u201d human behaviour. Nobody really uses IG in that nature, unless they\u2019re a bot. IG hates bots and makes it an effort to shutdown those automated social media tools everyday.Another reason Why F/U method is not the greatest is because of it\u2019s basis; people will ONLY follow you back as a courtesy and not because they truly love your content. This doesn\u2019t build an engaged audience as they are mindlessly following whoever follows them. Then your account will become more of tool rather than a vehicle to share your content. 2. Don\u2019t pay for or buy fake followers. This is bad because it\u2019s something that is going to ruin your accounts engagement rate in the long run. ER (engagement rate) is the average likes+comments you get on your posts / your follower amount. Most decent engagement rates hang around 3%-5%. Now What you should do. Post Great content consistently. Social Media is to share content and it\u2019s the basis of what keeps these platforms alive. If you\u2019re not feeding your account with the fuel it needs to run properly, you can\u2019t expext any sort of decent following what so ever.Post at the right times. User apps such as UNUM (iOS/Android) to see what your best time are, so that you can get the most engagement and get more exposure.Create or get invited to DM Groups. Reach out to accounts in your niche and create what\u2019s called a DM Group. These are groups that are made on the app itself, 15 max, in which all participants agree to like+comment on each others posts as soon as possible.Use relevant hashtags. Hashtags are the basis of exposure on social media, as people that are interested in certain topics use them to look for stuff they\u2019re interested in. Start by looking at what tags accounts you look up to use and then start compiling a list of related ones. Make sure to circulate your tags as you don\u2019t want to be shadowbanned for using the same ones repetitively.Use these tips and I\u2019m sure your account will grow! ",

It is appropriate to post just 1\u20133 pictures each day. 5.Combine a group of pictures to tell a story A group(3\u20136) of pictures can create a more interesting story. It makes your pictures more attractive and therefore brings you more fans. 6.Post your pictures on peak time. Any pictures can be submerged by large amount of contents after being published 3\u20134 hours later.Normally,the peak time when many users are online is morning,noon and night,especially the night. 7.Follow randomly the users in recommended part About 1/3 of the users you follow will follow you back. As there is limitation of maximum 7,500 users that you can follow,so unfollow those who don\u2019t follow you back. ",

            "answer_text": "Instagram is all about showing off a way of life and using glamorous looking pictures to make your products and services incredibly desirable. While this is true though, it\u2019s also only one part of how you can use Instagram to succeed and grow your business. At the end of the day, you can have the most inspiring Instagram account in the world but if no one knows about it, you aren\u2019t going to be selling many products! So, the question is: how do you go about growing your Instagram account and how do you make sure that you find the right followers? Read on and we\u2019ll look at some of the best strategies you can use. Integrating Your Instagram With Your Existing Marketing Hopefully, you will already have some form of marketing and this will most likely involve a website, a Facebook account, Twitter and more. One thing you can do right away to grow your Instagram account then, is to bring in visitors from those other channels. One simple way to do this is to add a button on your website that people can click in order to follow you on Instagram. This way, the more people you bring to your website, the more you will be able to grow your Instagram account. This will then also work in reverse; so that as your Instagram account grows, you are able to send more and more people back to your website! Likewise, use IFTTT (If This, Then That) in order to publish your Instagram pictures straight to your Twitter account. You can also get plugins that will show your Instagram pictures in the sidebar on your website, thereby helping more people to see the kind of content you are sharing there. Ask People to Follow You! This sounds a little too simplistic to be effective but in fact that is exactly why this is such a good strategy! One of the very best ways to get more people to follow you on Instagram is simply to ask them to go and check out your page. Just say at the end of your next YouTube video: \u2018why not check out my account over at Instagram?\u2019. You can do the same thing with blog posts. Socializing At the end of the day, Instagram is a social media platform and that means that it is a communication tool. Use it as such by making sure to comment on photos that other users have taken or to like them. Research shows that Instagram users find it flattering when brands like their pictures. And chances are that when they are flattered, they will want to check out exactly who it is that likes their photos! Influencer Marketing One of the very most effective ways to grow on Instagram though is to team up with other creators and to promote each other. This is called Instagram marketing and when done well, it will give you instant access to a huge audience that the other creator has spent time growing. ",

Every other day is a good cycle.Go with one theme, or have a system with various ones, but something that's pretty to look at when your profile is viewed. The easiest way to do that is with filters.Interact with other accounts, leave comments and likes, you don't have to follow, but it'd help.If you have multiple pictures to post, don't post them at the same time. Spread them out in your cycle.Vertical pictures for some reason are more often interacted with, compared to horizontal ones.Post pictures in the best quality possible. Be sure to put some actual effort into pictures.Try to be original, with a certain idea. People like that.When editing photos, avoid watermarks.I guess that's all.

            "answer_text": "Instagram has an excellent user engagement rate in addition to being a lot of fun to use. It is actually a very good example of a successful startup company. Along with Twitter and Facebook, Instagram is one of the most startup-friendly of the all social networks out there for new businesses in numerous markets, but particularly for those whose focus is on visual services and products. So whether you are selling interior decoration services, handcrafted products or some other kind of service or product, Instagram can assist you with getting your startup better known and providing it with more visibility. Here are the following 10 Easy & Effective Instagram Marketing Tips: 1. Post a minimum of one to two times per day One of the best things you can do to increase engagement is to keep your Instagram feed active. If you have a lot of interesting videos or images to share you can post more frequently than that - many of the large brands that are active on Instagram actually post numerous times per day.  However you should allow at least a couple of hours in between updates so that your audience isn't overwhelmed with too much content, or even worse, make you seem spammy. After you have established your posting schedule, be sure to stick to it, so you can help build a feeling of expectancy. 2. Get the best use from your profile link Given the fact that Instagram allows you just one link - make sure that you choose it carefully. A safe approach for driving additional traffic to your website is to add the link to your blog or homepage of your website in your Instagram profile. However, whenever you have a new social media that you want to promote, or have an upcoming event or are planning on running a special campaign, you might want to use your link for directing your followers to a special landing page that you have set up. 3. Add hashtags and captions to your images Make sure your captions are concise and add relevant hashtags to blend in with them so that it is easier to discover your Instagram content. According to studies, more engagement is generated by posts that have about 10 hashtags compared to those with more or fewer hashtags. Keep in mind that if you use too many hashtags their power will be diluted and your followers may end up getting confused. 4. Carefully choose your hashtags  When you are using hashtags, it is important to find the right combination between using tags that relate to your start up, trending hashtags, and hashtags that are descriptive of the theme and content of your post. The most important thing is watching your hashtag closely as well as the engagement that is generated by them, and to tweak them over time as needed. 5. Take square pictures In Instagram it is easier to scale down and crop square pictures while making sure that elements don't disappear. So whether you are using your digital camera or phone on your iPhone to take your Instagram-bound photos, there is an option for taking square pictures on your device. 6. Respond to mentions and comments Like any other social network, when you connect with your followers and fans it helps keep your Instagram page lively and increases engagement. Whenever you are replying to comments, you should answer the questions in the order that you receive them, and when resolving complaints do you best to do so in a friendly way. Also, respond to thoughtful comments, even if there isn't much for you to add - it will show you care about and listen to your followers and help you get more likes for your account. 7. Make exclusive offers A very effective way to show your appreciation for followers and drive engagement is to provide them with Instagram-only exclusive offers that they can't get anyplace else. Get as creative as possible with these. 8. Run image-based contests Instagram is perfect for image-based contests since a high percentage of the users there are mobile and own convenient smartphone cameras. You can ask your customers to take pictures of themselves while using your product in unusual ways or share what their reaction was after they used your services. Contest are very social in nature and a lot of fun, so people will be very attracted to them, as long as you offer some freebies and nice prizes. 9. Curate content It is much easier to curate content on Instagram compare to other social networks. You can regramm interesting photos that are relevant to your niche that individuals and organizations share (other than your director competitors). You can also share images that your followers have instagrammed. 10. Use analytics for monitoring your numbers  Monitor activity patterns, regramms, comments, geotags and hashtags. Using the basic analytics that Instagram provides is a good place. You can always transition over to more advanced analytics later. Read full post here\u2026 ",

It's one of the most popular social networking sites on the planet. 1. Cross-promote your dedicated hashtag. That's nice that you created a #joesgarage hashtag for your company, but who knows to use it to share content about you? Make sure it's in your profile, but take the game offline and have it printed on your receipts, in print ads, on signage in your store and at relevant events. If you're on radio and TV, direct people to use your hashtag. Integrate online and offline campaigns by ensuring it's listed on your other social profiles, on your website, and in your email blasts. Don't just hope people will find it. Don't forget buy some followers from belcm dot com to attract another instagramer's. 2. Get creative with hashtagging. When it comes to Instagram caption ideas, you need to look beyond the one-word, obvious hashtags. Sure, you want to use those, too, but mix it up and use hashtags to tell part of your story. Be funny, ironic, or outrageous--just don't be BORING. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to do that. One of them - organic. But it means a lot of work building your personal brand and interacting on Instagram. You have to be aware of the content you are posting, you should keep the same style of posts because consistency is very important on Instagram. You have to be aware of the time you are posting (at which hours your post would be most seen and so on) as well as you have to do the research of hashtags and its meaning so you would be able to use it in a correct way. Besides, you have to follow a lot of Instagrammers for yourself, interact with them while commenting or trough DM and at some point, you\u2019ll see how your own Instagram community will start to grow. The second option would be Instagram automatization. Nowadays this is a very popular solution not only for business but also for independent Instagram users. Instagram automatization allows you to get more followers and interact in more ways faster than you would manage to do it by yourself. Of course, this solution comes with some tricks that you should know and it also requires some of your work but for sure it is one of the easiest ways to get more followers and engage more in your activities through Instagram. I would recommend you to read more about it in this great article that I\u2019ve found or reading this blog, so you would know more what do you need to automate your Instagram and how can this be achieved.

            "answer_text": "Gaining followers on Instagram can be really difficult and sometimes it feels like a mission impossible. I felt this too when I opened my Instagram account. Here are some tips that helped me: 1. Upload photos frequently - Having an Instagram account is like owning a business, you always have to stay relevant and for that, you need to upload photos. Let your followers know what is going on on your life. Try to upload photos about four times a week and stories once a day. 2. Buy followers- buying followers isn't a shame anymore, almost everyone that wants to succeed and become popular on Instagram buys followers. It is a great boost for your account, and although what many people are thinking, buying followers is 100% legal. I think that this is the easiest way to gain followers without spending too much time. 3. Use hashtags- hashtags can expose you to your target audience. This is really important because then, you can gain more new and organic Instagram followers.  4. Do follow\\unfollow- this is a common \"trick\" that almost everyone will tell you about - follow a lot of people, wait until they will follow you back, then unfollow them. 6. Share your account on other social media platforms - let your friends on Facebook\\ Twitter\\ Snapchat\\ YouTube know that you have an Instagram account and ask them to follow you. 7. Try to collaborate - tell your friends to upload a photo with you and ask them to tag you in it. It can expose you to your friends' followers and there is a chance that they will follow you too. So, I think that a combination of all of those ways can really help you as it helped me. If you want to buy followers, I can recommend my favorite supplier- GetFans, they are very professional and have great services.  Goodluck! ",

            "answer_text": "For me, the steps I have personally used to gain followers organically are just following people and liking as many post as possible. While with a 100 likes of post there are chances you gain 10\u201312 followers, out of which if you don\u2019t follow back, few of them may unfollow you. So keep it as a rule of thumb to always follow the kind of followers you want and let the others stay or find there way. With following people who may be interested in the kind of content or reasons for setting up an Instagram Account in the first place, you get follower-ship quicker and you will notice that the number increases faster than just liking people\u2019s post. How do you know the people to like: Use hashtags to follow people within your interest, location, age etc. Use hashtags effectively and like the post with the hashtags, you will find a quite number of people following back. If you are into business, just try follow people who are your competitors\u2019 fans, this has helped me boost the number of fans for my clients. You can also follow those fans following businesses similar to yours. I point of warning, do not pay to gain fans. One, they don\u2019t really know the kind of audience you want. Two, they wont give you quality audience suitable for you. ",

I will not tell you to not use hashtags (I use them too) - but you should think about \u201cHow to use them?\u201d. If you just use random hashtags you will maybe get some likes - probably not even that. Choose hashtags from feature pages in your niche - so you have a chance to get featured. If your content is not on point this will not work - but at least there is a little chance. To grow you need to interact with your audience - search similar (but bigger) accounts and engage with his followers - like their pictures, leave comments (meaningful comments!) and collaborate with them. But the first thing you should watch out for is your own content. If your content is bad there is no reason to follow you. (Except you use other methods that are basically cheating) ",

            "answer_text": "Instagram quickly outgrew its first impression as a fun app for kids and has become a serious content marketing, selling, networking and audience building tool for individuals and brands. It's one of the most popular social networking sites on the planet, with over 200 million active monthly members sharing 60 million images and 1.6 billion likes per day. Just how awesome is it? Engagement rates for brands on most social networks are less than 0.1%, but Instagram blows them all away. The average Instagram engagement rate for brands in a 2014 Forrester study was an epic 58 times higher than on Facebook.  You can't argue with numbers like that. But that's just average. And as I advocate across all manners of online marketing, you don't want to be average! It's not a dream or a goal. Sure, 58 times greater engagement than Facebook sounds great, but you can do so much better than that on Instagram. Whether you're a big brand or maybe just wondering how to become Instagram famous, I don't want you to strive for average; I want you to reach for the stars and become an Instagram unicorn. A digital unicorn is that magical, rare creature that outperforms all others by orders of magnitude. And you're going to accomplish this by working these eleven amazing Instagram hacks into your social strategy. Check out these attention-getting ideas for your Instagram captions, hashtags, profile, and more, and see what to post on Instagram to get more followers and way more visibility and engagement too. 1. Cross-promote your dedicated hashtag. That's nice that you created a #joesgarage hashtag for your company, but who knows to use it to share content about you? Make sure it's in your profile, but take the game offline and have it printed on your receipts, in print ads, on signage in your store and at relevant events  If you're on radio and TV, direct people to use your hashtag. Integrate online and offline campaigns by ensuring it's listed on your other social profiles, on your website, and in your email blasts. Don't just hope people will find it. 2. Get creative with hashtagging. When it comes to Instagram caption ideas, you need to look beyond the one-word, obvious hashtags. Sure, you want to use those, too, but mix it up and use hashtags to tell part of your story. Be funny, ironic, or outrageous--just don't be BORING. Collaborative workspace company WeWork is great at this, and they include a fun mix of Instagram content, too.  3. Participate in massively popular conversations. For every post, use a mix of topically relevant hashtags such as #woodworking for a carpentry company, for example, as well as trending, super-popular hashtags wherever you can.  The really specific hashtags are like long-tail keywords in that they show more intent and help you find the right people, but the universally trending hashtags like #instagood, #tbt, #photooftheday or even plain old #fun get you in front of more people in general. You need both to make it on a social network as big and noisy as Instagram. 4. Make the most of your bio URL. It's prime real estate on your Instagram profile... do you really want your bio to only link to your website homepage, now and forever? Yawn. Change it up at least bi-weekly and use that clickable link in your bio to drive traffic to your newest or most popular content. 5. Get descriptive with your captions. A picture is worth a thousand words, but you can't skip the words entirely. National Geographic is fantastic at using storytelling alongside their Instagram photos to generate engagement and sharing. While traditional media brands have dropped like flies, NatGeo has thrived across digital and become one of the top brands on Instagram, with over 50 million followers.  Like the other Instagram hacks I've included here, this is something you'll want to commit to working into your strategy over time, so don't worry if it feels weird at first. Your writing will improve as you find your brand's Instagram voice. 6. Go all in on influencer marketing. Visit the profiles of each person you've identified as an influencer in your space (AKA a person who influences the people you want to get in front of) and \"Turn On Post Notifications\" to be notified every time they share new content. You can then interact with them regularly and become one of their favorite people or brands.  7. Remove unwanted tagged photos of you from your profile. If you only want to feature the best user-generated content about you or your brand on your Instagram profile, you can. Now, you can't remove the tagged photos from the site entirely, by choosing \"Edit Tags,\" selecting the ones you want to remove and choosing \"Hide from Profile\" (you may need to confirm). It does the trick. 8. Approve photo tags before the content shows on your profile. Speaking of giving you greater control over which tagged photos appear on your profile, you can change your Instagram setting so tagged photos won't show unless you approve them first. You'll find this under \"Options,\" \"Photos of You,\" and \"Add Manually.\"  I'm trying to think of a reason why any company would NOT want to do this... Nope. I've got nothing. You should absolutely set this up to avoid potentially embarrassing situations. 9. Develop your own Instagram style. It's human nature to want to fit in, but on Instagram, you want to stand out. Indian beverage brand Frooti has developed such a unique visual content style, it's instantly recognizable every time a user sees a Frooti post in their newsfeed. Check it out:  10. Get local. See what's going on in a specific area (say, your neighborhood, a city you're targeting in ads, or even an event in a certain location) by going to the search page and choosing the Places tab. Then, type in the name of the place to see all geotagged posts for that location.  11. Remember your calls to action! Instagram, like other social networks, is a conversation, not a broadcasting platform. What action do you want people to take on your post? If you don't know that, start over and figure it out. Staples is great at generating engagement by letting people know exactly what they expect them to do with their posts (bonus points if you make it sound fun). Often, that call to action cleverly gets people to share or virally spread Staples' content. How to Get More Followers on Instagram [Summary] To get more followers on Instagram do the following things: Promote your dedicated hashtag on your other social profiles, on your website, and your email blast.Get creative with your hashtags. Be funny, ironic, or outrageous \u2013 but never boring!Watch topically relevant and trending hashtags. Join these conversations to get in front of more people.Use your bio link to drive traffic to your newest or most popular content.Write descriptive captions.

            "answer_text": "Hi there, No matter what your age is, getting more followers on Instagram is the same. The first and most important thing is for you to decide why are you using Instagram for, for what purpose? Is it for self-branding, connecting with friends, something else? And this is because you won\u2019t be having the same posting strategy but there is one thing that stays the same for each and every category: do not post anything that you wouldn\u2019t show to your parents. Why? because one day, and that is for sure, that is going to byte you back - when people searching your name for reference or when you apply for a job, whatever. Now, that I got that out, here are some basic tips I can offer: have a content strategy. Know how often will you post and whatthink about captions and are they inline with the photouse proper hashtags. Not the ones that are above several millions because your content will be lost among many others; use the ones below 1 milliondo the hashtag research, look for ones that are similar to the type of post you are putting out thereinteract with others from your niche, comment and like their postsshare your posts on other social media - facebook, twitter; if you have your blog, think of the ways you can implement Instagram posts in it (other than as a widget, that is).Be present.Let me know how it worked out for you.

That way, when people visit these, they may stumble upon one of your posts that interests them and prompts them to follow you.Don't post too frequently or unfrequently. Try to post at least once every 2\u20133 weeks and once per day at the most. People are more likely to unfollow you if they see that you're clogging up their feed with so many posts that they can't see anyone else\u2019s. On the other hand, it's hard to gain any followers if you are inactive and don't post very much at all.Follow accounts that interest you and comment on their posts. When others see an interesting comment, they may be prompted to check out the account that wrote it.Give other accounts with a similar amount of followers shoutouts and have them do the same for you. This could simply mean mentioning their username in the caption of one of your pictures. (Example: Hey, if you like my posts, you'll probably also enjoy @example123. Go give them a follow!)II hope this helped! ",

To gain followers on Instagram you need to work the mentioned things regularly. I read this Rs 100 rule somewhere which is quite interesting and it is free. I have started working according to this rule with the brands I handle and I have started to see a rise in the growth of the followers. Let us Start! Every day : Search for 10 hashtags.Find the best performing 9 posts for each hashtag.Post a relevant comment (which accounts for Rs 1 per comment).Create a Growth Analyzer Go to Audiences on Facebook and create a Custom Audience. Go to Instagram Business Profile and select Everyone who engaged with your business in the last 365 days. It may take around 1 to 2 days to show you the size of the audience. Track the growth of your audience every 10 days.  Use Relevant Hashtags Find those 10 relevant hashtags and 10 top performing posts for each hashtag. Go to the posts, read the caption & analyze the images.Now go to the profile from which the image is posted, read through the bio and scan the profile.Leave a meaningful comment in line with your business.Use those hashtags in your posts.Repeat every day.Note: Don\u2019t pick Very promotional content.Misleading content.Spammy content.Scan the posts and check whether the audience is liking the post. Boost It Away If you are doing the above, you are now engaging with relevant community and you have a good potential audience. Now you can also start putting money behind your posts.

If you're not into a specific niche, and want to promote your own page then you should try one in which you are interested. Consistency: Consistency is the key to success in every platform, post atleast 3\u20134 pics everyday. Best time to post is between 8am-10pm. Use related hashtags: Use 8\u201310 related hashtags but don't spam the post with irrelevant hashtags. Engagement: Post that creates engagements are most likely to gain you followers. Ask questions in posts and that will increase your engagement. Don't do it for every post. Stories: Most people forget to post stories, they just concentrate on posts. If you're posting stories they're likely to be seen in the feeds of your non-followers of same niche. If it's interesting enough, they'll surely follow you. Follow others: You can follow others and they will follow you back. Best practice is to search hashtags relevant to your topic and like, follow the people who are posting the same thing. Shout outs: Obviously there are paid shout outs, but you can exchange shout outs to gain each others followers. And this can build a good community. I'll update this if I came across some new strategies. Hope this helped. ",

Make sure that you\u2019re posting stuff that your audience will enjoy.Be real. People like pictures that look real.

            "answer_text": "Craft a great bio and profile Your profile is the backbone of your presence on Instagram, and a well-crafted one is key to growing your audience. Two-thirds of Instagram business profile visits are from non-followers. Your profile needs to convince those new views to click the follow button. They won\u2019t do so if your profile is unclear, incomplete, or unappealing. Here\u2019s what you can include in your profile: Name: Up to 30 characters, and included in Instagram search, so you may wish to include a keyword. Username: Make it the same as your other social channels. This will make it easy for your followers on other platforms to find you on Instagram. Website: The only place on Instagram where you can include a clickable link (aside from calls to action in ads or swiping up on Stories). Bio: 150 characters to convey your brand identity and show new visitors why they should follow you. Share engaging content Great content gets people to like, comment on, and share your posts. That engagement gives you an Instagram algorithm boost and helps you get more reach and new followers. Everything you post must be interesting to your target audience. Your goal is to inform, engage, and entertain them with content. Your visuals must be compelling and your captions engaging. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what kind of account you have. Is it for business or personal reasons? If for business, then you could try looking up accounts related to your topic and follow people that follow them. Because you are targetting a particular niche of followers who like your topic they will likely follow you back for similar content. You could also ask these accounts to give you shoutouts. If for personal reasons, you should try to follow as many people as you can that you actually know first, then look through their followers for mutual friends and follow them. Overall, you will gain followers as long as you are active on Instagram every day and are engaging with your followers and content. Engagement is really important because if you\u2019re constantly liking and commenting on posts, there are people who will take notice and want to follow you. I gained a lot of followers this way. Also if your friends post photos with you make sure they tag you so more people will see you and want to follow you. Hope this helped! ",

While inspiration can be found in other people\u2014it is a piece of them, it signifies them. On the internet there are so many people doing so many different things\u2014we have this idea that we should learn from everyone. This creates much emulation\u2014which differs from the vanilla creativity that might originate from someone left to their own propensity. People will follow you if they see that you are not another emulation. The stuff that you post is fresh and does not follow a model except of your own devising. It can\u2019t be traced back to a recent trendsetter\u2014because you are the trendsetter. When other people emulate you\u2014it will be traced back to you.

This works for Brands 4- Get shout-outs: Ask your friends to give you a shout-out through their profile. It shows credibility 5- Post frequently: This is a no-brainer. Nobody likes an inconsistent profile 6- Go Live: Going live is a great way to interact with people and adds weight to your authority 7- Use paid media: Use paid media like Visit to profile ads but do not invest heavy amounts. 8- Cross-posting: Last but not the least and an important point is to connect and cross-post your content on other social media channels too ",

            "answer_text": "Providing you with 3 best ways to get fast followers in Instagram. 1.Incorporate hashtags. Yes, hashtags. They\u2019re a polarizing strategy because it\u2019s easy to cross a line here, but the fact is, they\u2019re the best way to get your content discovered by new audiences, hands-down. People search for and follow hashtags for their favorite topics, and if they search for yours, your post will get in front of them. Your existing followers will see your posts in their newsfeeds, but your ideal post should include hashtags to attract the people who don\u2019t follow you. There are only two lines you need to be wary not to cross: Relevance. Whatever hashtags you use, make sure you\u2019re using them appropriately. If you try to exploit a hashtag that you don\u2019t fully understand, you could wind up alienating your audience or seeming ignorant. If you\u2019re in doubt, do your research. If you\u2019re still in doubt, drop it.Volume. Don\u2019t stuff your post full of hashtags for the sake of stuffing it full of hashtags. This turns users off almost immediately. Instead, select only a handful that you feel are most appropriate for your post.2.Tag people. This is more common for individual users than it is for brands, but tagging specific people can be a good way to increase your visibility, so I\u2019m counting it as part of the \u201cperfect\u201d Instagram post. For example, you could feature a contribution or a member of your audience specifically and call them out as a way to bond with them. It\u2019ll also make it likely they\u2019ll share it with their own audience: If that doesn\u2019t work, you can select specific people in your audience you feel the post would be relevant for, or if you\u2019re really strapped, you could simply call out the individual accounts of your employees and team members. The key is to include some form of engagement that makes your post more accessible. 3.Miscellaneous quirks. In addition to the best practices I listed above, there are a handful of other, less obvious quirks about Instagram that could help you craft the ideal post: Blue images get more likes. According to a recent study, images with blue tones tend to get more likes than those with red or other color tones. If you can, try to post more images with a sense of \u201cblue\u201d about them, with the color dominating the majority of the image\u2019s area.",

However, I\u2019d love to give you the techniques that I did to grow my Instagram account organically. (These are just bullet points and some points need more of an in depth discussion. Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions :)) Make sure your Instagram is fully optimized. Review your bio if it\u2019s missing some hashtags, keywords or location that will enable people to find you easier and faster.Determine the niche your account belongs to. Then follow similar accounts that fall into the same niche. Your account will then be featured as a suggested account to follow to people who are looking for relevant accounts within a specific niche.Content! Instagram is a visual platform. It\u2019s no secret that you should post high quality content on your account. People are more likely to follow an account if they find that the content posted on it is either relevant, entertaining, relatable, trending, valuable and informative.Be consistent in posting. Post at least once a day in your feed and stories. Don\u2019t forget to include a relevant number of hashtags to optimize the post. Location tags and branded tags help in exposure too! If you\u2019re posting everyday at 7am in the morning, stick to that schedule.Instagram\u2019s algorithm for 2019 has placed a huge importance on genuine and authentic conversations. Therefore, engagement, engagement, engagement is key! If possible, do not use bots to engage as it only attracts bot accounts or fake accounts. Consistent comments and reactions to other people\u2019s content will boost your account\u2019s exposure.BONUS TIP: There is this one technique that I watched from Neil Patel\u2019s videos. He mentioned that following 30 accounts within 30 minutes will increase your follower base. Upvote if you find this helpful. :) Thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "Instagram Hashtags Not Working Whilst hashtags truly are an amazing feature for getting attention to your Instagram posts, sometimes they just don\u2019t work. If you\u2019ve just spent a load of time coming up with the best hashtags that suit your image, only to find that they aren\u2019t working, it can be incredibly frustrating. This post will discuss the four possible reasons why your hashtags aren\u2019t working and how to fix them. 1. The hashtag you\u2019re trying to use is banned. Instagram is very sensitive about the content it lets people post on its platform. There are actually over 114,000 banned hashtags, and many of them will surprise you as they seem completely normal to most people. If your hashtags uses a controversial keyword, even if you think it\u2019s not that bad, it may be the reason why the hashtag isn\u2019t working. The best way to check if your hashtag is banned is to search for it on Instagram. If your hashtag shows up, then it\u2019s not banned. If it doesn\u2019t show up, then it\u2019s most likely banned:  2. There\u2019s a Bug With Your App Whilst Instagram usually works well most of the time, occasionally your app can develop a bug which stops certain features from working properly. The quickest way to get rid of any glitch that your app may be having is to reset the cache. It only takes about 30 seconds do this and it should fix any issue that you\u2019re having with hashtags. Here\u2019s how to do it:  As it explains in the image above, once you get to this page just tap \u2018Offload App\u2019 to clear the cache:  3. You need to re log into your account. If the cause of your hashtags not working is to do with your account, rather than your app, the relogging will refresh the data that Instagram has stored on their servers. Therefore, logging out and logging back in again is another potential fix for the problem. 4. There is a problem on Instagram\u2019s side related to hashtag posting. Sometimes, Instagram can have problems with their servers, which can cause certain functionalities such as hashtags to not work. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not much you can do about this, and you\u2019ll simply have to wait for Instagram to fix the issue. Fortunately, Instagram is pretty quick at sorting these issues out, so try checking again in 30 minutes or so. Conclusion So there you have it. These are all of the potential causes and fixes for Instagram hashtags not working. If you have tried all of the steps above, and none of them seem to be working, then it may be worth reinstalling the Instagram app as a final attempt to get it fixed. Also, you can try contacting Instagram\u2019s support team to see if they can see the reason for why your hashtags aren\u2019t working.I ",

If you don't have a problem with getting a ton of ghost followers and horrible post engagement then you can of course do that. Been there done that. The best way is to grow it organically using the best form of advertising on Instagram. Hashtags. If your engagement is horrible your chances of getting brand deals will be too. I found people who had similar works or posting that I did. Or had things that interested me. Most of the time these accounts had between 1\u201350,000 followers. I began to see that the biggest ones used similar hashtags and I started to adopt the ones they used. And of course it depends on what you are posting. If you are into art, find the biggest art pages. Modeling? Biggest modeling pages etc. A lot of these accounts have specialized hashtags. The best hashtags are the ones that are created in link with a giant account with 100k+ followers that repost creators videos or pictures. For example #OurMoodyDays is a hashtag that the account OurMoodyDays uses to curate content for its feed. Using that hashtag on your own page and being featured can be a tremendous boost in your following and will prove to be vital. I grew my account from 0 - 13,000 Followers at the time of this post in a little over 2 Months. Changing up my hashtags, collaborating and getting featured on accounts that had massive followers. Also I believe posting everyday or having some sort of consistency is a big way to grow a consistent crowd. Right now my engagement is upwards of 7% which is pretty good. You can find me on Instagram at \u2018FrederickDBarnes\u2019 and ask me any questions. Or if you found this helpful swing by and take a look! ",

            "answer_text": "1. Mayfair is the most effective filter. The researchers found that while #NoFilter is the most used hashtag on Instagram, the Mayfair filter is actually the most successful at encouraging follower interactions. 2. Sunday and Monday are the two best days to post. While Thursday is the day people post the most, Sunday and Monday are the two days where engagement is the highest. So if you want more likes and more followers, post things on Sundays and Mondays with a high number of hashtags. 3. More #hashtags increase engagement from followers We can all probably agree that few things are more annoying than when a #caption #is #literally #nothing #but #hashtags, right? But as it turns out, those kinds of posts do much better in terms of engagement than posts that only have, say, one or two. \u201cAccounts with less than 1,000 followers where a post with 11 hashtags received an average of 77.66 interactions,\u201d the report says. The message: the more hashtags you use, the better. 4. There is no time of day better than any others to post photos. Contrary to what might seem logical, there\u2019s no better time a day to post photos for maximum engagement. In terms of photo posts, Instagram pretty much produces the same levels of engagement around the clock, 24/7. 5. For videos, though, after-hours posts do much better.  The research found that for videos, the data is different. Videos posted after work hours, between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., by far have the highest number of interactions. ",

( Girls can give the best relationship advice as the problem created by some other girl)5. Likings ( started following just after seeing dp)6. Intelligence ( not everyone but yes there r few. and after reading one problem shooting answer one can't make way from her \u263a )7. Attractive tag line8. Faminish answers taglines ( this attracts girls a lot . girls like those who promote faminism so this makes other girls to follow)9. And sometimes to tease few girls whose comments or answers prick us so in order to gift further word fight few follow them. Kinda revenge ( it happens irrespective of gender though)Now think , do few of among these , happen to boys! no! not really.Eg: (let's discuss no 8 ) if a boy speaks something in support of males he becomes Resist a criminal and If a girl does the same in support of females, she is talking about Equality morality Dignity and lot more. And more hilariously most boys support girls on this than the boy, not because they don't like the boy's answer or they look for equality or faminism but they want the girls attention.So by this incident 2 thing will happen1. All the girls started following the girl instead of judging r8 wrng of her words2. No of boys also do the same...And the boy will stand there all alone..(Please forgive me if I noised lil intense ...) ",

            "answer_text": "There are 2 very important things to gain followers on Instagram. They are good, quality content and distribution. Good content means that the content is interesting to the audience you are targeting - it has to be valuable to them, about them. You won\u2019t get people to follow you if you post something that doesn\u2019t interest them. So it means that you should look at similar accounts in your niche and see what the successful and unsuccessful ones are doing and see the differences - then apply what works. And distribution - even if you have the best content in the world, it has to be found, so you have to distribute it - it can be with hashtags, shoutouts, engagement groups or powerlikes. But make sure that hashtags are relevant to your content and not spammy ones. Plus don\u2019t use the big shoutouts if you are starting out - the goal is to rank in the top posts and it won\u2019t be possible to rank in the big hashtags for you. And when you use shoutouts, powerlikes or engagement groups - make sure that those accounts have the followers from your target market, otherwise it will be very useless to use, because your content will be shown to the people who follow those pages. And one more thing - consistency. You have keep posting consistently - you might not see the results in the very beginning, but don\u2019t let it discourage you, because it could take some time to warm up, as IG doesn\u2019t want new accounts to start grow like crazy because many could be spam accounts. Or maybe you will start to grow fast right from the beginning. ",

It is better to have a hundred highly engaged followers than a hundred followers who are inactive. Quality over quantity. You will have it easy over the long-term.Cross-platform. Spread it to other social media accounts you have to a highly engaged audience and bring them over to Instagram.Pick a niche and stick with it. You can branch out later.Comment, like, and share others with other users to connect with them which creates a loose network.That is all I can think of for now. ",

            "answer_text": "So you want to get more followers on Instagram. There are tons of tips and tricks on the web telling you to post consistently, post at the right times use the right hashtags, etc. But let\u2019s be honest \u2014 these tips are extremely generic and don\u2019t work well, especially if you\u2019ve just started a new account. Hence, I\u2019m going to take this from a beginner\u2019s perspective. Starting from zero. If you\u2019re just starting out, organic growth is nearly impossible. You\u2019ll have to do whatever it takes to get your first thousand followers to kickstart your audience. Let\u2019s dive right in. 1. Join follow for follow groups. Joining follow for follow groups is one of the most underrated strategies you can utilize to grow your Instagram followers rapidly. Followchain, Reddit\u2019s r/Followback, and r/FollowForFollow are some examples of these groups. Follow for follow groups are basically places where you can self-promote your Instagram. Now you might be thinking \u2014 the people you follow probably won\u2019t engage much, or at all. Wrong. These groups reinforce the follow for follow strategy. What do I mean by that? These groups connect you with people in your niche who will not only follow back but engage consistently. After all, engagement is the most important metric on Instagram. So you don\u2019t want to be following people randomly. Instead, follow people within your niche to increase your engagement rates. Follow for follow groups allow you to accomplish just that. 2. Follow everyone you know on Instagram. Friends, family, acquaintances, etc. Ask them for their Instagram handle and follow them. People you know tend to follow back and engage more because they want to stay updated on your life. 3. Follow mutuals. Instagram has a feature where mutuals can be easily viewed under a user\u2019s bio. Typically, people are more likely to follow an account that has mutuals compared to someone that has little to none. This is because mutuals is a trust factor. The mutual feature also makes it easier to find an old friend\u2019s Instagram. They are more likely to follow you back as you\u2019ve probably met them in person before. 4. Un-private your Instagram account. Un-privating your Instagram account will increase the reach of your account. If your account is private, hashtags cannot be utilized as your posts wouldn\u2019t appear on the explore page. If you un-private your account, people are able to follow easily. 5. Don\u2019t post too much. Contrary to other people\u2019s advice; you shouldn\u2019t be posting too much. One post per day is more than sufficient. In fact, if you post too much, users will end up unfollowing you or muting your posts which will negatively affect your engagement rate. 6. Have a nice-looking feed. You have to have a decent-looking Instagram feed if you want to attract more people to follow you. Naturally, users are more attracted to following someone with a decent feed rather than someone who spends little to no effort in trying to beautify their feed. Moreover, a well-designed feed will give a lasting impression to someone who visits your page for the first time. 7. Constantly engage. In order to get more followers, you\u2019ll have to show that you actually care about your existing followers. Like and reply to every comment you get, consistently like and comment on other\u2019s posts, reply to every direct message, like posts with hashtags within your niche, and leave positive comments. These are just some steps to take to increase awareness for your Instagram and get more people to engage and follow you. Restrictions Please take note of certain restrictions on Instagram! Do not repetitively follow or direct message or you will be temporarily action blocked. The block can last for an hour, 24 hours, or more which will negatively affect your marketing efforts. Instead of following/direct messaging others repetitively, do them in intervals of 5\u201310 minutes. Bonus tips Be very meticulous on who you choose to follow (check their niche, engagement, following, etc. first). Constantly check, unfollow, and remove ghost followers to increase your engagement rates. You can do that by downloading apps on the app stores that track this. ",

            "answer_text": " People like to reply to what they feel connection to and want their reply gets seen and replied by you. So the first and most important thing to do to gain more followers, is to care about your current followers. So, they will bring more followers with them to your page by the word-of-mouth. If you look for quality followers (not followers who follow you, cuz you are a girl or because of invaluable and even obscene content, but for the value you add to them), another very crucial thing about getting more followers, is not to strive for getting more followers! It is true. The more you try to attract followers (by leaving invitation comments every where and paying to be seen), the more weird you might look. Instead, try to work on the quality of your page. Post beneficial contents regularly. Your posts must be easy to comprehend (videos and images are best) and raise in the minds of followers. This way they will start discussions under your posts. This is what Instagram LOVES and makes you bee seen by more people. One last but not least important thing is to be innovative. See what your opponents have posted and try to come up with a newer, more valuable and more comprehensive content. Or try to read and observe several articles and contents of your opponents and with all the information these contents provide you with create an analytical content. Also try to put your own perspective and opinion in. Actually, there are a lot of other innovative strategies fr gathering more followers on Instagram, but these three are the most important factors which if applied properly will lead to a great desired result.

Remember, cute doesn\u2019t always convert.Post quality, square cropped photos and videos that gives context to your product, service, or message.Use Instagram stories. These are displayed prominently throughout the Instagram feed and on your profile.Use Instagram Live. This can often trigger a notification to followers.Make the copy/headline clear, short, and too the point.Show your personality, uniqueness, and brand through everything you post or say.Immediately after posting a picture or video (and it\u2019s important that it is done immediately, so prepare before posting), add up to 30 relevent hashtags as a comment. Make sure the hashtags relate to your content or brand.Engage with other Instagrammers in your niche. Genuine follows, likes, and comments on pages with an audience similar to yours can pay off.Join Facebook groups in your niche that allow you to share content.

Well, this post isn't about \"How to boost your Instagram followers in a day\". This is about cross-selling. Cross-selling is important and if you're creating content but you aren't cross-selling, you're losing the game. I sell my LinkedIn on Instagram, I sell my Instagram on Quora, I sell my Quora on LinkedIn. Cross-selling increases sales by making customers buy more than they thought they would. For example, they all are following me after consuming my content on Quora. When they opened Quora, they wanted to consume content from Quora but ended up following (buying extra) me on Instagram as well. It also increases the retention rate and lifetime value of a customer (readers in my case). I'm selling content here. What are you selling?  Follow me on Instagram @yuganshchokra, LinkedIn, YouTube and Twitter. ",

            "answer_text": "You can find a ton of answers to this but what works the most are Be patient - I mean really patient, Instagram has killed the exposure that artists generally look for, it has become nothing but a pay-per-view kind of platform, so if you want to grow you instagram \u201corganically\u201d you have to put in a lot of effort and sometimes your efforts might not be reciprocated, but keep your head down and enjoy what you are doing, it\u2019s just another social media.Find a niche: Don\u2019t post random stuff on your Instagram page, if you are a model restrict your posts to your modeling, if you\u2019re a photographer, show off your work, but don\u2019t combine 2\u20133 different profiles into one.Be original: I\u2019ve seen so many people who are just copying each other in the name of \u201cinspiration\u201d, don\u2019t be that person. Be original, even if you\u2019re bad today, eventually you\u2019ll get better, but don\u2019t copy others\u2019 ideas and call it inspiration.Interact with others: As much as most people want likes/followers for themselves, it is imperative that you interact with others too. This way you maintain a relation with other artists which will help your Instagram to grow. Long story short, Be nice to others.Put in the hours: I know it sounds like a full time job, but you have to invest some time each day on Instagram for you to grow, from posting your content, interacting with others\u2019 content, replying to the people who interacted with your content etc., this will take some part of your time daily. So, be prepared to put in the hours.Hope these help :) ",

All of these growth hacks and methodologies you hear about work only for so long. Eventually, too many people hear about it and Instagram cracks down on it. The best thing to do is post content regularly, if not daily. Always use upwards of 25 hashtags. Make sure your hashtags are diversified. For example - maybe 10 hashtags have under 500,000 posts Another 10 hashtags for 500,000 - 1,500,000 posts. 5 hashtags for over 1,500,000 posts. And definitely interact and engage with similar profiles. ",

But you should have a special approach for this action, you should publish the understandable quality content. so others engage it when they find it. Keep it in mind, Whether your page is personal or business your content always matters; It is the critical part. But there are one billion using Instagram, so you will find a satisfying amount of followers even if you create total nonsenses, there are some features for you to become visible and findable by others: HashtagsFinding for relative peopleBeing active and responsiveHashtags are like search terms of google, suitable for showing you in the Discover tab of the app or various searches. using this feature in posts will make sense for Instagram\u2019s search engine to bring your posts up in search.

Hashtags: Look, there are many mets around right or wrong usage of hashtags. What I do, and is working good for me is; Using 10 hashtags.2 - 3 hashtags with 100k to 200k posts.7 hashtags with 10K posts.1 hashtag with maximum reach.I you are just starting your Instagram, try and use hashtags with less posts, try and stay in top 10 posts of the hashtags. Find a few hashtags and use them every 3rd day. What I would also recommend is, create a set of 10 hashtags and start using it. Engage with same category profiles: This is somehow very much important, this is how I do it; I engage with 10 profiles on daily basis.I make sure that I add value in their profile.By engagement I mean, I share, like and comment their work.Do it continuously, and make sure that you do it for long. Do not leave things. IG Live Do it. Do it as often you can. Make sure that you follow the following tactics; Go on live with big creators, do not worry there are people who replies and connects.If someone with less follower than you asks you for a live, do say yes.Make your questions ready. Do not look blank.If none of these works, you have a way to boost your instagram posts and increase your reach. Thats all for now. Hope it works for you. You can connect with me on instagram. I talk about digital marketing and business growth. ",

Identify influencers and if they offer paid promotion in your niche, just go for it 3. Post regularly on time when large number of your users are online 4. If you are any local business, try to add location while you posting 5. Always post HD pics for better user interaction 6. Identify what your competitors or influencers is doing. First follow the same strategy and then try your own strategy P.S do not use hashtag like like4like follow4follow. These kind of people will be of no use, as there main intention to increase followers and not engagement ",

You gain followers who are already interested in that theme which makes this effective.Before you go ahead and do step one, do this step first: Post visually striking photos. If you look at Starbucks, they are consistent with their drinks.Use relevant hashtags. It's easy and tempting to just use the most popular hashtags. However, I found that it's more beneficial to use relevant hashtags to reach quality users.Share each other. What I mean by this is finding someone similar to your theme and posting each other in your respective accounts to cross-pollinate your followers. Similar to influencers, but it's free! :)IG: @aj.c ",

If they look like they're worth following, follow them. Look for follower count and click it. This should show their followers. Look at profiles, like posts and follow. Use suggested follows if they're there. Continue to do this. On your own profile, post original pictures and stuff. Eventually you will get follow-backs from some of the people you followed. Notice other people's posts that have a lot of likes and get ideas for your own posts. Post with some bit of regularity. Colorful posts tend to do well. Interesting, engaging, and original content will give people a reason to follow you. ",

Share interesting images or photography that will attract others to like your posts and want to follow your account. Use your imagination when writing about your images you share, such as, information about the photo or a short story that goes along with it. If other Instagramers comment on your post, always thank them for the comment. Being courteous helps and can land you some extra followers along the way. My advice, stay away from purchasing followers on Instagram. Having a large follower number does not guarantee success, in fact\u2026 in the long run this way will hinder your account. Most Instagramers are wise to this type of number fluffing and will stay away from such accounts. Plus, these fake followers are usually caught by Instagram as spam and shut down. Learn to market yourself properly and you'll attract followers in time! ",

Now, what other options you have to do? Well, you can try to learn how to make videos. Videos are a great way to attract new followers to your profile. Next, you can ask/pay for some other pages with more followers to promote your page. When we talk about promotions, you can switch to the business profile, and start to sponsor yourself. Hashtags play an important role in Instagram. People search through hashtags to find their interested topics or activities.

You put all of your information on any account like yahoo messenger (which is what I use) or AOL (America Online which is what I used to use before that) to sign up and then you do the same thing on Instagram to set up an account there. Create a name for your page, you can use either your real name or make one up then start getting followers by posting pictures of yourself (or whatever you want to post) it's easier if you already have friends on another website like Facebook and Twitter (a lot of my followers on Instagram came from those) and then you build it up from there by using hashtags for whatever the picture you're using is like #selfie #food #clothes etc which will get other people to see it and that's how you get more followers.

Well, it\u2019s not actually a secret and you can use it with absolute ease. Just visit Instagram and head to the Search & Explore page. You will see hundreds of posts are ranked there which lead thousands of quality followers to different accounts and pages. So if you also want to get tons of real followers, you should also get your posts found on the Search & Explore page. And to do that, you just need to purchase some Likes to inflate the Engagement rate. You see, Instagram picks and shows posts on Search & Explore page based on their fast Engagement rate. So if you buy some real Likes and artificially inflate your Engagement rate, then chances are you will find one or two of your posts in the Search & Explore page. And they will do the job and bring thousands of followers and likes to your account. So get some awesome posts uploaded on your account and inflate their engagement rate. You will be having thousands of target audience coming to your page on a daily basis. Meanwhile, don\u2019t forget to buy some Followers to give your account a serious look. The Search & Explore page will drive hundreds of new people to your account, and to attract and convince them to follow you, you should have an appealing profile filled with followers. Then, only then people will think that you are sharing awesome contents, and most importantly, you are an authorative one of your niche. So they will gladly follow you and keep liking your posts. So buy some followers and likes to level up the game. There are many reliable sites like #Krootez which offer both Likes and Followers at a highly affordable rate. So I think it will be easier for you to use this secret hack and get success on Instagram. Hope this helps Cheers\u2026 ",

That might make sense logically, but truthfully, there\u2019s a lot of off platform shit you need to do first that\u2019ll help grow your followers on a platform like Instagram. For example, if nobody knows who you are, nobody writes about you, and you don\u2019t have a presence of any kind off platform, you don\u2019t have any sort of validation that people need in order to make the leap and trust you / follow you / want to invest in you. So you have to figure out who you are and what you\u2019re selling, do the usual marketing and PR thing, and plug and promote your Instagram within that. Once you have a decent following (let\u2019s say 1,000 active fans, but it could honestly be half that), then you can start focusing on all the on platform stuff like managing hashtags, regramming, interacting with more popular accounts, and in some cases, buying shoutouts and ads to promote the account.

You may increase your followers in the short term but they will do you no good in the long run. 3 things to do : 1 Post good quality content, i.e. good photos and good captions. 2 Include up to 30 hashtags in your comments. Some people make the mistake of going for the most popular hashtags,which is a mistake. For example if you are in the motivation niche if you use #motivation there are over 131 million posts. That is pointless as there is no chance of being found on the Explore Page. It is better to start with hashtags between 50,000 and 100,000 posts. One example is #motivationiskey with 91,000 posts. 3 Make meaningful comments on popular accounts in your niche. Don\u2019t just write \u201cgreat post\u201d . Make your comment relevant to the post.

Now, I list some actions to do, to unleash your page potentials and make everyone follow you. 10k is beginning and you have to think about 100k Instagram Followers and even more if you have a goal to grow your Instagram.

Your current followers find your content interesting and would share it with their friends. You can go viral with sharing. and this only can happen with high-quality content to stun people viewing your page.

It takes time, but when you find your way and understand your niche and media, then you will get your prize. You reach your goal. I love to explain some real examples of some of these rules.  The first part they see is your Profile Picture. If you are a Person, your profile picture should be a recognizable nice picture.If you are a blogger, a brand, an online store\u2026 Then your profile picture should be your logo.The logo should be clear, nice, recognizable, eye-catching, cool\u2026Consider it shows inside a circle.Look at below pic that shows how your profile picture should show, and remember transparent area is not showing. Keep it in the center.  The second part is your Profile Bio. Be coolBe clearTry to write just important info, use your niche keywords, and do not use lots of emojisAdd your website, your phone number, location and directionsAlso, you can share your current offers, discounts, campaigns\u2026    The Last Part is Instagram Posts. Use high-quality images/videosYou have to posts high quality, which attracts the eyes of the viewer, as many users are using new phones like the iPhone, Samsung, Asus\u2026 Which benefits high quality LED or LCD screens. So each Pixel should have optimum quality.Keep the Best Ratio. According to Later, generally speaking, your vertical photos should have an aspect ratio of 4:5.

This works best on accounts with 2-40 likes per picture and follow more people than follow them. You only need to like 5-7 picture and comment on one for this to work. Doing this about 1-6 people will follow back. You also need to be careful not to triger a ban on commenting,liking or following but doing this to much for an account your size I'd say start by doing the above to four people an hour and buold it up slowly. I have looked at your account. The photos are good quality. Some could be better but this will improve with time. ",

            "answer_text": "Getting Instagram followers was an easy task, till the end of 2018. Few months ago, many accounts noticed a drop in their account reach and impression, which resulted in a drop in post likes. So, many Instagram experts concluded that Instagram has introduced its new algorithm which restricts your post to show to other audience. The engagement rate dropped to 7 per cent. So in 2019, only way to get more followers depends on following factors Be Organic. Don't use bots and automations to boost up your likes and followers, otherwise Instagram will consider you as a spam and restrict your reach. As a result your reach will decrease.Try to post stuffs which attract audience. Dominate your style and uniqueness on Instagram.Don't use third party apps to increase followers and likes. Instagram allows you to promote your post by paying some amount to Instagram. This is a best way to increase your reach and impressions. Instagram charge \u20b940 to promote your post for 24 hours, \u20b980 for 48 hours, and so on.Be consistent. Post regularly and timely, when most of your followers are active.Use effective hashtags. Don't rely on broken hashtags which are related to pornography and violence. Use hashtags in sets of 9, 12 , 15. Don't overuse it. 10\u201315 tags are enough.Learn to wait. Nothing happens overnight. It may take months or years to build a strong followers base. And that too depends on your strategies and hard-work.Promoting your post is the best way to increase your account reach and impressions, which will result in a increase in your followers, which are 100% genuine. I personally suggest you to try a paid promotion on Instagram. ",

You could try following some popular pages that a lot of other people follow. I have personally noticed that doing so often gets me follow requests from people with similar interests. You could also try following some pages that share funny/interesting content and comment on those posts. Lastly, you could try and take the initiative by striking up a conversation with someone through the comments, although this might not always be considered polite - and you\u2019re not guaranteed to receive replies. If you\u2019re trying to gain followers as a celebrity/content creator Then the best way to engage your audience is to keep an open account where you post regularly, making sure you use the correct hashtags, so that your posts turn up in the \u201cDiscover\u201d section. Also try asking your friends to spread the word, and don\u2019t forget to use other social media platforms to turn your fans into followers. :) All the best! ",

Follow about 100 people every hour or two from followers of pages related to the one you're trying to grow. Be sure to get some kind of unfollower app to unfollow anybody that does not follow you back. Same goes for unfollowing as for following, so i'd recommend unfollowing about 100 people every hour or two. This way you can grow your base without spending money on ads and growth will be consistent as long as you keep it up. This may not be the best method out there, but it's worked for my page so far.

This are the steps I could recommend for your Instagram success: Think about your profile first. What is it all about. Is it for Fitness related or food related, whatever it is, give your description accordingly.Post daily at least 3 times a day with relevant Hashtags. If you publish from your Instagram app, whenever you write something with #Tag, Instagram will suggest you relevant tags accordingly. Choose wisely with proper relevancy according to your post & profile and you will see success pretty soon (By the way, at present, you can only choose maximum 30 Tags for a Instagram post).Use Instagram more humanly, like you find something over there and you appreciated it with a comment, like. But don\u2019t spam. If you genuinely feels that particular post is worth your attention, just like and save it to your collection and the same thing will happen to your Instagram profile too.Hope I have helped you in a certain way. Please let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. ",

They tend to just be photos from my everyday life (landscape photos, pictures with my friends, etc) and occasionally photos of my face. I know a few people who have seen a large uptick in their Instagram following, which they accomplish through: use of hashtags which are relevant to the photo they posted, having their account set to public, putting in a location for their picture, having a very aesthetically pleasing feed, posting pictures with people with larger followings and tagging that person, or asking friends with larger followings to tag pictures with you, marketing themselves in other spheres (for instance achieving some sense of fame which encourages people to follow their lives).

I am always confused when a person who just posts uninteresting content and selfies over and over again and has thousands of followers. As a curator or account holder you owe it to all your followers to put in work to make sure the quality is there. As well as being active in your niche's community. Talk to others, get to know your peers. Helping others can lift you up too. Whether your content is for a business or a personality it must have a combination of all these aspects.

Imagine people at work all stressed out and they happen to follow your page or even if they don\u2019t they found your video while scrolling on memes and videos and watch your video and made them laugh. there will be 99% chance that they will open your profile looking for more contents and when they find more meaningful contents or videos 99% of the time they will like or follow your page. for example: here\u2019s an instagram page Trendingsudden you can follow them as well if you want. from the start they started to post video content and they have had good amount of increase in their followers. so post something that people want to see not just about your business or product and services. have you seen meme pages or news pages how fast they get the followers. so social media is all fun for people who don\u2019t have pages for business runners it\u2019s always about business.

Instagram won't allow more than this. Follow top insta accounts with the highest number of followers e.g Selena Gomez Beyonce etc. And Magic will happen. Once you do this people start following you or liking your posts. Post images with high quality or write killing description. One of them should attract followers. Be engaged with similar accounts. Like them and they like back. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to increase the number of followers and attract active followers. If we think a little logically, just as other people's personal pages are not attractive to us, so our page when we put our personal photos in it is not attractive to anyone other than friends. So the first thing is to be able to make our page content attractive and useful to different people. To do this, we have to choose quality photos and videos for the subject we have, because the first thing that attracts the audience is the photo or video. In the caption section, we should write text that is related to the photo, video or topic that we want to provide to our followers and try to be short but useful. Because the Instagram space is more visual and people are more looking to see than to read. So good photos and text are very effective. After that, choosing hashtags can increase the display of your page content and show it to new people, because sometimes the question or request of people other than your followers can be in your post, which increases the likelihood that they will follow your page. In general, you can achieve your desire by observing the following points: 1. Optimize your Instagram account 2. Keep a consistent content calendar 3. Schedule Instagram posts in advance 4. Get partners and brand advocates to post your content 5. Avoid fake Instagram followers 6. Showcase your Instagram everywhere 7. Post content followers want 8. Get the conversation started 9. Find hashtags that convert 1o. Make your Instagram followers happy ",

Do your quick research and find 10\u201315 competitors or similar accounts to yours. Check their like-to-follower ratio, you want at least 10% of your competitors\u2019 audience to be engaging with their content - that means that their followers are somewhat real.

You\u2019ll get their attention, they\u2019ll visit your profile, and hopefully follow backUse RELEVANT hashtagsCheck-in and include your location in posts whenever possiblePost at optimal times (see chart below). 7. Tag friends in images and posts, when appropriate. 8. Download Crowdfire or Followers+. These apps will help you decide who to follow or unfollow. Crowdfire also has a feature which allows you to copy/target followers of other IG accounts (competitors, like-minded businesses, friends with large followings, etc.). The last time I checked Crowdfire had to remove the feature temporarily because of issues with Instagram\u2019s API though. ",

Content belongs to the people who create it and Instagram, in their terms and conditions of use, forbid any breach of copyright. NOT ONE SINGLE sharing app is authorised by Instagram for this reason. Don't be a dick, create your own content. Engage with others, like their posts, comment on them, be nice. Don't beat a thief like the guys from Autogram. ",

This doesn\u2019t mean clickbait pics and videos but rather high quality content. Next you have to go and search your top 10 hashtags in your niche and comment on other peoples content and looking to help and interact as much as possible. It will take time to do this but it will ensure you that you will be bringing in real followers rather than people looking for you to follow them back. 1 active follower that interacts with your account is better than 100 followers that are only there in your followers number.

Its like YouTube, having followers is not enough, you need to have views and view time. Same concept. 2. Just by posting and sitting on your behind, waiting for followers to find you will not work either. Hope this helps. I suggest you follow Gary V and read up on official Instagram functions.

Just this week Instagram announced they will be cracking down on that practice. Meaning if you did buy followers and IG sees that you gave your login information to a 3rd party for the purpose of buying followers you will actually see your numbers DROP. Second, the follow/unfollow is an old/tired practice. People on IG are aware of it and actually do notice if you follow them just to boost numbers. Don't be surprised to see your numbers go up and down as they do the same to you. The rest of that list was solid. Hashtags, posting often, tagging friends, Geo-tagging works well too. Bottom line, don't obsess over numbers, if you want to be seen on IG feeds, engagement is way more important than follower count. \u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f ",

Same applies to any kind of page ie. fashion bloggers, photography, etc. This will not happen overnight it will take time.

This method is against instagram policies and your account can be blocked or suspended by instagram.
