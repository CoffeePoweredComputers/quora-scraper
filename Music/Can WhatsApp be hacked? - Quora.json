            "answer_text": "How can WhatsApp be hacked and what to do to avoid it Cybercriminals can use different techniques to steal access to your WhatsApp account. And once they do, in addition to being unable to use your profile, the information you have stored on that platform, such as your conversations, could fall into other hands. One of the ways that this can happen is that a cybercriminal, who knows your WhatsApp number, seeks to verify that account on another device. Of course, if you do, that account will no longer be available on your cell phone. But for this to happen, the system asks for a verification code that arrives by SMS or voice call. And if you received a message like that, you would realize that there is something strange but it could happen that the user who seeks to hack your account, when requesting to log in to your WhatsApp on his cell phone, asks to receive the code by voice and if you do not answer that call with the code, it will be recorded in the answering machine. \u201cIf it is requested that the message arrives by voice message and the user (the true owner of the account) does not answer because he is at the cinema or sleeping, for example, the code will be saved in the answering machine of his mobile. And in many cases, the password to access the voice answering machine that is by default is very easy to deduce. So if the user did not modify this password, the attacker could easily access the verification code in order to log into WhatsApp from his smartphone, \"explained Luis Lubeck, Eset's security analyst, in dialogue with Infobae. It should be remembered that it is possible to access the cell phone answering machine from a landline telephone, hence an attacker can easily resort to this technique. Once the answering machine is entered in this way, you will be asked for the password to the answering machine which, as already mentioned, if it was not modified and is the one that is by default, is easily identifiable. In other cases, criminals use other methods, based on deception and other forms of social engineering, to get the account owner to inadvertently provide the verification code. \"In some cases, an SMS is sent through a user contact who has previously been hacked with a message that says, for example: 'You received a code by mistake on your cell phone but in reality, it is for me, can you give please? \u00b4. As you get the message from an acquaintance, you trust and give him the code, without thinking, \u201dLubeck emphasizes. Once the attacker managed, by whatever method, to take control of the WhatsApp account, activating the second authentication factor to shield the account and regain access becomes very difficult. To make a claim of this type you have to contact the platform directly and verify the identity and that what one says is true is quite complex.  Here, the recommended precautionary measures recommended avoiding falling into these types of traps: 1. Activate the two-step verification by entering WhatsApp in the \u201cAccount\u201d section, located within the \u201cSettings\u201d or \u201cConfiguration\u201d section -depending on the device model. 2. If you receive a message that provides a verification code, avoid sharing it with third parties by any means. It does not matter if a supposed friend or acquaintance requests it: everything can be a hoax. 3. Remember that the platform does not ask its users for information through messages -SMS, WhatsApp, or other messaging services- or through phone calls. 4. If you receive a WhatsApp message from an unknown user, it is advisable to block and report the user through the options that will appear on the screen. 5. Check regularly on which devices WhatsApp Web sessions are open, and avoid opening sessions on shared devices. 6. In case of being the victim of a maneuver of this type, notify your contacts and report what happened before the corresponding authorities. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever recieved a message from any of your contacts that reads something like this ; Hello I'm having trouble and asked WhatsApp to send you my sms code ? Well, if you have recieved such from a friend,his/her line had most likely been hacked ,and the hackers were trying to do same to yours. A recent research conducted in Australia showed that in 2019 alone, Australians have lost almost $90, million. The figures rose by 62% during the period the COVID- 19 lockdown lasted,with one in every 6 social media user falling victim. According to the research conducted by sodware security provider,Nortonlifelock,this was common across, WhatsApp,Tik-Tok and.instagram,getting even more young people when considered themselves to smart to be scammed How is this possible ? WhatsApp is a messsging application linked to your mobile phone number .The app.os designed to be used on one device at a time, With an advanced end to end encryption that only allows sender and recievers to see the messages Any attempt to login in from another device requires a 6-digit verification code that only the owner of the sim card has access to. When the hacker tried to access your WhatsApp account from another device the app prompts for the 6-digit code . Niw,this is where you to be alert .the hackers will try to get the six digit verification code by any means They could claim to be calling you for any reason and then request the code to verify that you really own the sim card.Or they could claim that you are the beneficiary of some windfall and they need the code to confirm. The sad part of it is that as soon as you fall victim,all your contacts become potential victims as well, because they now utilise the access to send a WhatsApp message to them. The mesaage could also be asking them for their verification code ,personal or financial details,or it could start out as a romance or online dating where the victim is roped into believing that he is in some sort of romantic tryst. Your WhatsApp account can be totally stolen or hacked as long as your attacker knows your number and can have a quick glance at your phone screen. Your iPhone doesn't need to be unlocked they don't need your WhatsApp password or your email address and they'll probably get an archive of all their WhatsApp chRs ND call logs as well ojcd they've hijack the account \u2022 News WhatsApp update is bad need for iPhone users \u2022 The best password managers: Protrct your online account \u2022 New:28 Antivurus products share nasty foaw that can brick PCs,Mac. This attsch would easily work against co- workers roommates,spouses,classmates and so on .it would even work against someone your are having lunch or coffee with or your boss All your target needs. Is for you to leave your location alone for a few seconds such as when you to to the bathroom.Software247 atAol .com security researcher walked us through this process in a blog post on (April 20) and honestly, it seemed too good to be true .But we tried it ourselves, and much to our horror ,it totally worked .at this point would normal tell you to protect yourself with one of the best password managers softwares or some of the best Antivurus software.But this rather ridiculous security hole doesn't involve password or malware Fortunately theres any easy way to avoid this kind of attack : You need to enable a PIN or your WhatsApp account one that you'll need to enable when porting your account to a new phone . You might want to also disable text messages previews although we know that totally inconvenient . I hope this helps . ",

            "answer_text": "Point #1) Whatsapp canNOT be hacked because it cannot be installed on 2 separate machines at the same time. This holds good for most of the modern chatting Apps. The moment you install whatsapp for the same cell number on a different smart phone, the older version is wiped out. Hacking means getting access to somebody's private data such that the person never realizes that he/she was ever hacked. Point #2)Ask yourself why do you need to hack somebody's private messages. If you are thinking to do this for your married or unmarried partner then keep in mind that, spying on somebody's private life may very well push the offenders behind bars. This is true in most of the countries of the world. Point #3) Hacking in general is a difficult topic and generally is a result of exploiting a loophole in a computer software/system. One successful hacking technique does not last long. The moment it is diagnosed, developers put a fix in place. Hacking needs in-out knowledge of a software system + the techincal expertise with teh involved technologies. July 2020 Update: \u201cWhatsapp for web\u201d is an in-built feature of whatsapp. If you have logged in to your whatsapp using WhatsApp Web on a PC browser, the session may have remained saved there(for a few days). People with access to that PC can see the whole of your whatsapp using this. However, it will work only for a limited time(a few hours or days). The only prerequisite is that your cellphone should be ON with an active internet connection. Now, this is not hacking in a true sense. However, it does the job of occasional eavesdropping on somebody\u2019s conversation(most likely a family member). ",

There are many ways like installing a spy apphack the mobile phone of the victim itselfUse vulnerabilities in whastapp to hack it etc.The use of spyware is nothing new and you will find many tutorials on the internet or even qoura so lets move on to the other topics Now lets see how hackers really like to snoop into your mobile.When you install a an unknown apk you actually might be opening a backdoor to your device using which thw hacker can get every single data from your device (even your whatsapp chats and media ) An app no matter how secure is still vulnerable because there might be something someone has missed for so long(a bug). Hackers often like exploiting these vulnerabilities in the app to gain important data. As i am writing this on september 8,2020 , today morning i came across four recently disclosed vulnerabilities in whatsapp which could have been exploited. So you must always nothing is secure(atleast not for ever). If you really ant to know more about how hackers expoit these things and how someone can hack your whatsapp , i would recommend going through a book named Certified Blackahat by Abhishake Banerjee and Abhishek karmakar. You can learn many things as it might violate the terms and conditions of Qoura. ",

Whether it would be a technical or a social vulnerability, it can be exploited. If people find security flaws in the software, exploit it in certain ways and abuse it for their malicious intents, I see no reason why that cannot be done. However, it is probably a majorly complicated issue to get into the application, and multiple layers of security protecting it don't make it easier. Another approach is Social. Either phishing or another form of getting employees credentials or access to development devices. If you can\u2019t do it directly, you can always attempt another approach. I would assume that there are security measurements for such issue as well. But it is not all 100% safe. Additionally, I recommend reading other answers here as they are equally insightful. ",

So what \u2018WhatsApp\u2019s security team\u2019 do is, they increase the level of security to an extend, that hacker has to spend huge amount of resources and time to hack WhatsApp. And trust me, the security is strong enough, to stop any average joe form hacking WhatsApp. So if your WhatsApp account is compromised, it\u2019s more likely that, the suspect has access to your device. Hacking WhatsApp conversation wirelessly is not possible. There are few whatsapp hack tool like WhatsApp Sniffer or methods like spoofing mac address which claims to Hack whatsapp conversation.

Though I\u2019m not going to give any hacking tips but would like to directly answer the question, yes it can be hacked. Any software can be hacked. When you use an application all does in the background is just transmitting information through combination of 0\u2032s and 1\u2019s. That\u2019s what all softwares do. Hence all it takes is decoding those encrypted methods which are used to transmit the messages will obviously enable hacking any of the respective software. But doing so is actually difficult, though not impossible.Software makers spend lot of money providing data security of their users and hence protecting their privacy. So of course it won\u2019t be that easy to hack. But you can think currently someone somewhere is sitting and trying to find a loop hole to break into it. :) ",

But the question is always asked wrong, it's not about if something hackable or not, its about whether it's feasible to hack it or not. It all boils down to the benefit to time ratio. If you benefit too little by spending too much time and resource to achieve it, then there is no practical sense to hack. Every security measure that is designed right for any system, always depends on this key feature. Make it non feasible to break into the system. I will put forth a very practical example, people say that MAC\u2019s are very safe and don't need antiviruses as they don't get infected. Do you think the brilliant hackers/ programmers out there are so incompetent to not hack into the system. No that is not the case, the point is MAC\u2019s are less vulnerable partly because they are less used in comparison to a Win box, hence a hacker with malafide intentions would gain much more return on his investment of time by creating a malware for WIN. Even if he writes amazing code or finds a real tricky bug in MAC OS, his work won't pay dividend to him as the machine installed with MAC OS is very less comapred to WIN, and thus his intended target audience decreases and so does his potential scale of harm.

Its almost impossible to hack their site because they are multi billion company with modern equipment, brilliant engineers, high talented security or hacking professionals employed.

Whether it be the students using WhatsApp, Zoom, Google Meets etc to attend classes, employees working from home or even normal users on various social media apps. With almost little to no outside activity, more and more people are spending extended amounts of time online, leaving them prone to cyberattacks. Already cyber crimes have increased in frequency since most common people don\u2019t have extremely high-end cybersecurity installed on their home computers. Now, the Maharashtra Cyber has come out with an update for WhatsApp users and how they could be open to conmen hijacking their accounts. What Is Maharashtra Cyber Warning About? The nodal agency for cybersecurity and cybercrime investigation in Maharashtra, Maharashtra Cyber, recently posted about a modus operandi that hackers were using to gain access to WhatsApp accounts in India. *This article was originally published on ED Times* ",

What you need is copy a sim, insert in your device.Install whats app, enter that sim number, get OPT (as you have copied sim so you\u2019ll get a message in this number).Enter OPT. Sync. DONE.Cons for this is : The actual user will also get the opt so if that person is smart then he\u2019ll login again and your account will be blocked. This cycle can go on until a complaint is filed for sim copy.Simultaneous two whats-app can\u2019t be run so either your or their whats-app will be stopped.You can just extract messages and cannot use it forever.",

Moreover the Whatsapp using using crypt8 encryption for storing messages locally. for crypt8 decryption we require the private key associated with the particular account. which can be obtained only if the mobile is Rooted ( works only with android). So none of the methods known to be working to hack whatsapp. Biggest challenge is whatsapp can run only single session so no chance of logging in on other device without notice of the user. Recently whatsapp changed its authentication process they added many techniques to authenticate the device previously only mac address is validated to login. Now they are validating the serial no. , mac, device ID, device name, what not everything in the build.prop . So cloning the application with data also wont work. ",

This server has very little security and hence can be hacked very easily. I recommend to use some Android application like leo privacy app developed by Leomaster. There are two ways to hack a WhatsApp device: through IMEI number and through Wi-Fi. WhatsApp doesn\u2019t have a very secure server, so avoid using WhatsApp when on Wi-Fi.Generally, Android and Apple devices that use WhatsApp do not have any security. It is Blackberry devices that are extremely safe as they use their own server, while others use the WhatsApp server.So, generally, avoid using Wi-Fi for WhatsApp, if and whenever it is possible. ",

You might be able to use a keylogger to record typing and then have it sent to your phone. Now have it be HACKED and remotely use It? Not sure, since Whatsapp depends on your phone number and usually needs you to be connected to use it at all. So generally speaking, no, but it can be spied on. ",

They might record activity of your phone and may also read your messages sent or received.Always see that a chat is whether end to end encrypted or not?

We have not developed a sharper eyesight, a more sensitive olfactory system, a more powerful muscular apparatus, and so on. As a matter of fact, our physical faculties are in general less advanced than those of our animal relatives, so it was not an improvement of the primary modelling system that explains our increased brain volume. It is highly likely, therefore, that the brain increase that took place in human evolution was largely due to the development of those new faculties that collectively make up our second modelling system, the system that eventually gave origin to language. The main point is that this new system was a genuine novelty, something that no other species managed to evolve. We are facing therefore the same problem that we encounter in all great events of macroevolution: how did living systems give origin to real novelties? A useful clue comes from another macroevolutionary event: the origin of the first animals. In that case the starting point was a population of cells that could assemble themselves in countless different ways, so how did they manage to generate those particular three-dimensional structures that we call animals?
