            "answer_text": "Orchestration You are assigning the composer\u2019s notes to instruments without changing anything, except you can change and add octaves where necessary. You cannot leave out any notes unless you are eliminating an octave double, and that only when necessary. When changing or adding octaves, you cannot change the order of the outside voices, i.e., the top voice MUST stay on top, and the bass voice MUST stay on the bottom\u2014you cannot cross any voices above the melody or below the bass. You generally do not change voicings, voice leading, or add/delete notes that the composer did not write, unless you are certain that it was only technical reasons that prevented him from doing so himself. In some cases, counterlines or sustained elements that were not evident in the original work may be extracted from existing harmonies and assigned to an instrument. These \u201cnew\u201d elements are justified by the voicing leading in piano pieces being obscured in many cases, and there is the sustain pedal to take into account. Examples include Ravel\u2019s orchestration of Mussorgsky\u2019s piano piece \u201cPictures at an Exhibition\u201d, and Ravel\u2019s orchestration for orchestra of his own piano piece \u201cPavane pour une enfante d\u00e9funte\u201d, though there are aspects of this last one that put it more in the domain of transcription. Often the term \u201corchestration\u201d is co-opted in certain commercial areas to mean different things. For example, in film and show work, the person named orchestrator could be anything from a proper orchestrator (such as Jonathan Tunick for Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Broadway shows, or John Williams\u2019 film orchestrators, who work from detailed sketches) right up to a full arranger or even co-composer, who takes the sketchiest of musical information and creates a complete work out of it. In some pop circles, the term \u201corchestrator\u201d is misused to mean an arranger who writes for strings, e.g.; \u201cHe is orchestrating a Beatles tune\u201d to mean arranging it for orchestra. I suppose they think there is a connection between \u201corchestra\u201d and \u201corchestrator\u201d, so by this logic if he was writing a concert band arrangement he would be \u201cconcert banding\u201d the Beatles tune. Transcription You are adapting the piece to fit a new instrumentation, the way the composer WOULD have done it, had he written it for this group. Figurations may change, certain registers may be re-assigned where necessary, and voicings could change if the original does not suit the new ensemble. Examples include Brahm\u2019s \u201cHungarian Dances\u201d for orchestra (originally for piano), Arthur Frackenpohl\u2019s transcription for woodwind quintet of Joplin\u2019s \u201cMaple Leaf Rag\u201d, and the version of Horace Silver\u2019s \u201cNutville\u201d arranged for the Buddy Rich Big Band (originally for jazz quintet.) Arranging You may change or create from scratch, as necessary: phrasing and ornamentation of the melodyaccompaniment figurescounterlineschord voicings, harmonic progressioninstrumentationform, construction of the piece as a wholekey, octavebasically anything, while keeping the melody recognizable. Strictly speaking, even as original a work as J. S. Bach\u2019s \u201cJesu, Joy of Man\u2019s Desiring\u201d is an arrangement, since it was based on an existing melody and only the accompaniment and counterlines are Bach\u2019s own. Historically (say, before the 20th century) the meanings of the terms \u201ctranscription\u201d and \u201carrangement\u201d were reversed; the transcription requiring more artistic input and the arrangement staying close to the composer\u2019s ideas.

            "answer_text": "(A2A) Well \u2026 I\u2019d say that orchestration is more complex, with more invention and generation of new, separate parts rather than harmonizing of existing parts or melodies. It\u2019s probably a spectrum of complexity and invention, with orchestration on one end, and arranging on the other. Edit: I may be wrong.
