            "answer_text": "I have kind of a mixed feeling about it. I do think Ariana Grande is a great vocalist and obviously she\u2019s very attractive and sexy. BUT what I don\u2019t like is her portrayal of feminism. \u2018God is a woman\u2019 is obviously a feminist inspired song, undermining the stereotype of God normally being portrayed as a man. Okay, I do get it and I don\u2019t have any problems with this either. HOWEVER although Ariana Grande likes to portray herself as a feminist, the image she portrays of being a woman is a) wear tons of make-up in order to look as sexually attractive as possibleb) wear bunny or cat ears like models used to do in Playboyc) make clich\u00e9 sexual poses in video\u2019s What I\u2019m saying is: Ariana Grande on the one hand confirms with the image of a woman being portrayed as a sexual object, on the other hand she complains that women are being portrayed merely as sexual objects to men. If you ask me, this latest song \u2018God is a woman\u2019 has a lot to do with clever marketing. Madonna knew nothing sells as good as controversy and provocation and the reason we\u2019re talking about this song here is a sign this strategy works. It has all been done before by Madonna who also created a mixture between feminism, sexuality and religious influences in \u2018Like a Prayer\u2019. In a live show she even crucified herself as Christ knowing it would stir up comments. So, although the song in itself is \u2018not bad\u2019 I think Ariana Grande gives a very clich\u00e9 view on feminism. On the one hand, she confirms to the image a woman should look like a supermodel, including oversized fake nails, fake eye-lashes, hair extensions, the typical pin-up, merely a body for a glossy men magazine, on the other hand she complains about women being sexually objectified.

            "answer_text": "I like the song a lot and i don\u2019t really understand why people are so offended. It is clear that the song is about women empowermant but about the video and the idea \u201c god is a woman\" i think that \u201c god \u201c is more of a metaphor . So many cristians but not only say that it is about blasfemy . \u201c god\" referes to an ultimate power most because of he's many definitions and forms wich caracterise same idea of an omnipotent omnibenevol entity . The song isn't a manifest about religion but more about gender equality. Ariana plays her role really well and her voice is pleasant , the lirycs is well taught and it does not deserve the amount of hate that she's getting. It is also true that religion play a major role in this problem but this is a diferent topic. ",
