            "answer_text": "Definitely not. I know lots of producers who have both gone to school for theory and music production, and many who haven\u2019t done either. They\u2019re all pretty decent. If you\u2019re looking for someone to work with, find someone that works with you, is excited to work with you, and understands your style of playing and recording. Some people can just \u2018get\u2019 production, while others need the theory as foundation. As well, it makes a difference as to who the producer is working with. If it\u2019s musicians in a band, it\u2019s easy to just say \u201cplay that again with more juice\u201d versus recording classical musicians who want/need specific instructions like \u201cplay that Bm7 to F bar in staccato.\u201d Still, I\u2019ve worked with some people who can explain to classically trained artists what they need to do, simply, and without theory. All in all - it will never hurt you to have some knowledge of musical theory - but there are successful producers who don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: No, you don\u2019t need to know music theory to make good music. Some people just understand how to make music work without knowing actual music theory. Long answer: Not necessarily, although it depends on the kind of music you want to make. I am a musician and although I do know music theory, I don\u2019t typically use it to come up with things. Once you\u2019ve played music for awhile, you sort of just know what sounds good. If you\u2019re just trying to create something cool and fun, especially with today\u2019s music, you can get away with pretty much anything. If you were trying to make an homage to Bach or something like that, yes, you should know music theory so that you can understand what they were doing and how they were doing it, but even then I wouldn\u2019t say you need to know it because some people can just hear specific patterns or tendencies in music and can replicate them without actually knowing what was happening on the page of written music. It\u2019s very much dependent on the person making the music. ",

Take any of the greatest artist and even some of the producers from the years before the 90\u2019s and many or even most I dare say have any music theory education and yet they produced some of the greatest music ever. Some like George Martin who most likely understood music theory all too well just tossed it out the window when working with the Beatles because they flew in the face of music theory and broke just about every rule on their way to becoming the greatest band of all time. I have been writing songs, performing and even producing music for many years and I never studied music theory nor could I care less in ever learning. Those who can make music and those who can\u2019t study music theory and criticize those of us who actually make music. ",

Simple examples: If you play a progression of Am, C, G, Em, you are using your knowledge of music to create an oft-used progression. This is not only theory, but an application of theory. There are zero successful musicians since the time before Bach that doesn\u2019t know the above progression along with myriad other simple progressions. A drummer knows to count to 4. Once again, there are zero drummers in the entire history of music who don\u2019t know this fundamental truth of rhythm. Do you, who plans to work with musicians, really want guys \u201cwho know no theory\u201d to look at you like a moron for not even knowing the basics? Of course not. So, yes, learn some theory. You don\u2019t have to be jazz-level theory, but you have to at least know the basic. ",

But theory is one of the most useful things you can learn if you want to produce music to the best of your ability. It\u2019s also necessary if you ever plan to talk to and work with other trained musicians, composers, arrangers or producers. Learning simple theory is one of the most useful things you can do as a music producer. Knowing the building blocks of music will allow you to make music with more intention, and take your music further than just \u201cwhat sounds cool\u201d. Music theory has been developed over hundreds of years and is still developing, and there is a reason that music students undergo rigorous music theory and analysis courses. Can you have a conversation with someone who speaks a different language? Maybe you can get a general idea across, but the conversation would be much more interesting and effective if you learned their language. Music is the same way. If you ever plan to effectively communicate your ideas to others in the music industry, music theory is an essential tool you should learn in order to be understood and, ultimately, taken seriously in the industry.

However, when latterly he decided to turn his hand to classical music, he lacked the requisite theoretical knowledge and expertise. Therefore, he engaged professional classical musicians such as Carl Davis and the late Richard Rodney Bennett to assist him. Classical music is historically theoretically conceived through the medium of staff notation. That makes it innately more complex because more intellectual processes are involved in that conception.

If you are heavily involved in Vocal Arranging, Composing, and Arranging the composition I strongly recommand picking up some music theory because it helps you analayize each section of song when arranging. Understanding harmonic relationships is very important. Vetern Record Producer Ron Fair is similar to Quincy Jones that not only has a great ear but a strong music theory background as he's very good at Arranging for strings and vocal arranging. ",

The interviewer first showed a clip from a recent concert, which showed the bassist doing a very complicated bass solo, sitting alone on a chair in front of the audience, one-handed, while up-ending a jug of whiskey onto his face as the crowd erupted into cheers. The camera panned back to show the studio, and the interviewer chippie asked, \u201cWHERE did you learn to play the bass like THAT!\u201d Then the camera dollies in to a close-up of the bassist\u2019s face smiling hugely as he intoned,\u201dJew\u2019-lee-ards!\u201d The wildest, most esoteric, least-establishment type of playing starts out with a firm grounding in the basics.

Even this though simplifies as I am very confident that Sinatra worked very hard on improving his abilities which means that whether he read a book on being a better singer or listened to great singers (in the hall or off a recording) he was learning theory. Theory is merely ways of expressing what works and why.
