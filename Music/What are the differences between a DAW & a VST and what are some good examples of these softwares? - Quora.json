            "answer_text": "I have an application called Reaper. It is a DAW \u2014 Digital Audio Workstation. When I boot up Reaper, I can chose to access various plug-ins I have downloaded over the years. One of them is FreeEQ, a cute little three-band EQ from Eric Sounds. That one is a VST \u2014 Virtual Studio Technology, a format for audio plug-ins. Reaper will also host AU (Audio Unit), JS, Rewire, and several other kinds of plug-in. Among the VST I have is the Aria VSTi. That little \u201ci\u201d stands for \u201cInstrument,\u201d and the Aria Player is a Virtual Instrument; a sampler player that itself hosts compatible libraries. In this case, three of the orchestral and band instrument libraries made by Garritan. ",
