            "answer_text": "Most rappers don\u2019t have a normal perception of drugs. Most grow up in a drug world where everything around them is based on drugs. Gangs form to protect drugs. People get robbed to buy drugs. People sell drugs to have a quality life. In their world, drugs are viewed as an unfavorable way of living. When rappers write songs about drugs it\u2019s alost like a way of giving tribute and letting the people they grew up with know they aren\u2019t alone. If it\u2019s not that then they are letting others know that they are at the top of the drug scene and others can do it too. Drugs are a way of life for a lot of people in this world. ",
