            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of people saying that she doesn\u2019t write her songs and that is completely untrue. To conserve her integrity as an artist she does credit many different individuals who have HELPED her in her creative process, but this does not necessarily mean she doesn\u2019t do any work. Beyonc\u00e9 works with like minded people who know the messages she tries to get across. She knows what she wants a song to be, and she may just need help to get to that place. Having songwriters help you develop a certain way of writing a song is not the same thing as having them right the song for you, and it shouldn\u2019t be said that the songs she makes are seperate from her and not of her creative talent.

            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t go into detail because, frankly, I do not have the time to write out the name of each person involved in every song she has ever produced! However, in short, she participates in the song-writing process. As far as I\u2019m aware, she has influence over her songs and will assist in the writing process, but never writes them on her own without any help whatsoever. Now, this isn\u2019t to say that other writers involved don\u2019t simply act as editor for work she has written herself, but she would need to confirm this. ",
