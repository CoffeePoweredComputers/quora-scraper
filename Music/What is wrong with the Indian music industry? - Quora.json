            "answer_text": "The problem with India's Music Industry is that there is actually no music industry in India! Look at the title of this video, for instance:  It is so nonsensical for anyone to think that mentioning the name of an actor is more important than the name of a singer. What are you expecting from me as a random person who watches this video? I would obviously assume this song to have been voiced by Jacqueline Fernandez. And btw, what do Tiger Shroff, Disha Patani, etc have to do with the song, honestly? Oh, but you had no space left even to write the singer's name. T-series is itself a music label, and a distinguished one. Still, they barely contain any respect for singers. And people would call the song as 'Jacqueline's Ek Do Teen', even though that girl had nothing to do with the creation of the music for the audio. So atypical to call it 'Sherya Ghoshal's Ek Do Teen', right? This is a prevalent case. Maybe because in general, there is lack of collaboration for independent music, and musicians only work only under other films and labels with singers almost only doing playback and not making their own music videos. All of this might seem normal to you, I am not surprised. But the truth still remains that although we have so much talent in our country, artists often don't get the respect they deserve. A musician's dignity is no less than that of an actor's. JUSTICE FOR INDIAN SINGERS! ",
