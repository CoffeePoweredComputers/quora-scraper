            "answer_text": "Is buying vinyl records a good investment ? I would say not. Enjoyable yes. I am a qualified Accountant in the UK who collects records and is now selling part of my collection. We all buy or rent music because we like it, we enjoy the listening experience and the effect it has on us, That is our prime objective. We also gain some enjoyment from the collecting experience. If due to a change of circumstances or tastes we wish to reduce our collection consider the medium we initially spent our money on. Spotify or downloads are in effect rentals, we cannot sell and are sunk costs. CD\u2019s have some second hand value but as I have found not very much. The only medium that has some reasonable second hand value is vinyl. So to get some of your initial costs back vinyl is the one. I have numerous thousands of vinyl singles and CD\u2019s up in my loft that I need to sell. The vinyl comprise chart singles and LP\u2019s of bands that were popular in their day. the singles I may get 10p/15c each and the LP\u2019s \u00a31/$1.50. The CD\u2019s maybe \u00a31/$1.50. Firstly they cost more than the realisable value and then if you consider the time and costs involved to sell either on say ebay or discogs and then trips to the post office. These were not a good investment and probably end up in a charity shop. However I have vinyl records that I bought second hand that have considerably increased in value over time. What they generally have in common is that they are all second hand 45\u2019s, didn\u2019t sell a lot, either by somebody famous or the item was rated in that particular genre, and they seemed a lot of money at the time. Far more importantly these purchases were made before selling platforms became popular in the UK. All my good investments I bought over the counter from sellers who were not IT aware. My advice to a new collector is not to treat them as an investment but just enjoy the music, and vinyl is always best. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a record collection and the value of it gained a double percentage number in the last 5 years each year. But as a record lover I have no intention to sell it anytime soon. You can check the value if you have your records entered in your Discogs-profile. If you think about investment, there are a couple of things to consider, for example: The more a record is wanted (i.e. popular) the better the chances are, the record will be more valuable - check for example here: Discogs - List of most wanted records: Explore Vinyl on Discogs\nDiscogs - List of most popular records: Explore Vinyl on Discogs The above two links show you particular releases - you have to dig in every one of them and figure out, if you have the pressing from the right year and country, the condition etc. to determine it\u2019s value. The second very important question would be: How do I get rid of them in the most economic way? Let\u2019s assume you have 100\u2013500 records and you want to make them to cash. If you sell your collection as one collection, only dealers will come up with a price which will most likely be 50% or less under the value that you would get if you sold the records individually. If you sell the records online individually, there is a lot of hassle involved. I am not going deeper into this as you might know what\u2019sw necessary to sell something on ebay or any other c2c website, I just want to pint out that appropriate packaging is crucial to a good record deal. In the end the answer is basically always the same when it comes to collecting. If you do it just for the money, you\u2019ll certainly fail. If you do it for the music and in the end you realize, you have a record that sells for 100$and you only paid 15$ enjoy the profit. If you want. ",
