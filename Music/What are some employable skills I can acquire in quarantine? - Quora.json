            "answer_text": "There are many employable skills that you can acquire so I can name some that you can learn: Problem-solving skill: If you were struggling to solve your problems before quarantine, then you can learn to solve them now. Such problems could be your messy room or unfolded laundry in your closet. So make sure to solve these kinds of everyday problems as they will give you a sense of responsibility to solve your problems and this will help once you\u2019re employed as employees do indeed work a lot for any store or company.Oral communication: If you were struggling to speak before the quarantine, there are a few ways to fix them. try making a speech for yourself to speak any speech and say it in front of no one as a start. then, when you start feeling comfortable talking, try doing the speech in front of your family and if you are successful in doing so, then you are good to go as your family are human beings so talking in front of others would be a piece of cake as well. I\u2019m not sure if my way might actually help and if it doesn\u2019t then check out some youtube videos talking about how you can communicate with people more effectively. Communication is a big part of many entrepreneurs and employees in other businesses.Resource management: Managing your resources is a big part of many businesses and companies as running out of them may lead to the loss of them. If you are struggling to do this, then try this. Imagine that you\u2019ve run out of most of the food, water, and other resources that you\u2019ve saved for the COVID-19 pandemic. Your resources are now scarce and so you must go to the supermarket to buy supplies and food for your family. What must you do? First of all, we must list the necessary supplies and food that you need. Then, you make a prediction or an estimate of how much money you need for this. And lastly ( this may be optional ) decide when you\u2019re going to the supermarket so that you will successfully be able to buy the things you need as the products there might be finished by the time you arrive at the supermarket. Now that you were successfully able to plan this out and now you got your foods and resources that you and your family needed, you now have to manage these resources such as how much to eat every day? which ones to start with? and so on. This is how you manage resources and it is very crucial for businesses.These are all I can think of. Of course, there are many more skills to learn but I personally think these 3 are the most important. So yeah, there you have it! ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many actually, but I personally now learning about Digital Marketing from Udemy. The platform itself is not free, but there are selection of material that you can choose based on your personal interest, starting from entrepreneurship to mathematics. Yet, to answer your question, I will suggest you to google skill that is mostly required at office so you could set your direction.
