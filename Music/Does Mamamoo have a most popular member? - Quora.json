            "answer_text": "As an international Moo Moo I cannot say what people think in South Korea but using sources and charting I have made some estimates. MAMAMOO is just one of those groups who\u2019s member\u2019s popularity changes often. I believe the most popular in Korea is probably Wheein or Hwasa right now. Wheein\u2019s solo song \u201cGoodbye\u201d charted very high on Melon and in Korea. Wheein fits the Korean beauty standard well and I haven\u2019t seen anyone, not even netizens say anything bad about her. If you read the Korean comments you see that they praise her beauty and her voice. Solar used to be the most popular because she was on WGM (a popular korean show) and fit the korean beauty standard. She\u2019s not as high as Wheein since netizens tend to hate on her because she\u2019s the oldest member. Another really popular member is Hwasa as many have mentioned. She might also be most popular now in Korea since she eats a lot and goes viral, has lots of deals etc. She\u2019s confident, has a great and healthy body and her recent solo \u201cTwit\u201d was very popular! Someone else said that she\u2019s the only one who gets to be controversial- it is true but they all are to some extent. Since Hwasa doesn\u2019t fit the typical Korean beauty standard she fights back and that gains her more fans. Moonbyul is probably the least popular in Korea, (though as a Moonbyul stan I have no clue why) I think it is because the other members have now become more popular. Ever since Wheein got rid of her bangs she\u2019s been more recognized for her looks. Moonbyul used to be more popular but now she\u2019s more popular internationally. Overall, Mamamoo is a great group who have so much talent- they released their new song \u201cHip\u201d that has a hard choreo and addresses their haters, they can sing very well (They recently won Queendom, a show against other girl groups) and can rap! I wish people would become true fans and love them for more than their looks. Internationally its Hwasa/Moonbyul, in Korea its Hwasa/Solar. They are all beautiful, inside and out! ",
