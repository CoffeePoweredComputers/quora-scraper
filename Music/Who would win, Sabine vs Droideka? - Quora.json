            "answer_text": "Depends on the terrain. Sabine\u2019s no Jedi - she can\u2019t dodge (or block) blaster bolts that are as powerful as that of a droideka. Over flat terrain with no cover and a good distance between them, the droideka wins. But, if Sabine can find some cover, she wins. See, the shields the droidekas have are deflector, not ray, shields - they block blaster bolts, not solid objects. So if Sabine can throw a thermal detonator (miniature, please) under the droideka, the droideka is dead. Generally, in the kind of situations we see in Clone Wars or Rebels, there\u2019s plenty of cover. So Sabine wins. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming she had or could get to cover, I\u2019d bet on Sabine. She utilizes a myriad of explosives, which can exploit many weaknesses of droideka shielding. Droideka shields cannot repel slow-moving physical objects, which allows the droid to move slowly while still engaging its shields. This allows mines to destroy them. Explosives can also be slowly rolled under a droid. Falling debris from another explosion can also crush a droideka. Also, if the ground is destabilized, and the droideka falls over, its shield disengages and it becomes easy to destroy. Without cover to defend against the droid\u2019s blaster fire barrage, Sabine would most likely flee to a more tactically advantageous location, and them employ any of the above strategies. ",
