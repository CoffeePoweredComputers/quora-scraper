            "answer_text": "I've seen him (them) twice before, and would absolutely see them again. My Mother surprised me with tickets to a Marilyn Manson show for my sixteenth birthday. The show was 18+ but she somehow managed to photocopy and then alter my birth certificate in order to get me into the show. She's a pretty cool lady. She wanted to go too. He's an amazing performer, very engaged with the audience's reaction to what he's singing or doing. As far as the music goes, the whole band was excellent and the songs are just that much better when you and everyone around you is screaming the words. I suppose both times I saw him, he was very \"into\" the performance. As far as the show aspect, there was lots of throwing water at the audience (I caught a bottle), simulated sex with a microphone, tearing at his clothing (not to mention costume changes worthy of a satanic drag show), an anatomically correct female automaton walking around stage with a serving tray which was later assaulted and torn apart, cannons that shoot glitter and black confetti. You know, a little something for everyone. The last time I saw them was probably six years ago, and the band members have changed since then. But if you like the music, you'll have a good time. A word of caution: don't wear your shiny new bondage pants that have spikes on the pockets. Security will not like it, and you and your mother will have to run down Colfax Avenue to borrow a steak knife from a diner in order to saw the spikes off & make it back to the show just in time. Very punk rock. ",

Long time ago\u2026.Didn\u2019t really like their music, didn\u2019t know much about the guy nor their music\u2026 But after this mini concert I\u2019m still digging their music. Won\u2019t go as far as saying I\u2019m a big fan now. But certainly like their music. The concert itself was rather explicit. Lot of bodily fluids, lot of screaming but besides all the insanity also a really good performance and really good live music. They are real pro\u2019s, despite all the weird stuff that looks to be totally unplanned (but is in reality probably planned out entirely). In the end Manson smashed his guitar and threw part of it into the crowd. The crowd went wild! Except for the one person who actually catched the piece. With her head\u2026. The poor girl was knocked out and an ambulance had to drive through the crowd to pick her up and bring her to hospital\u2026. That most probably wasn\u2019t planned. But still, it was something to never ever forget. ",
