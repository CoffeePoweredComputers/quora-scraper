            "answer_text": "There are currently numerous fan bases that it\u2019s tough to choose which one has the biggest number. This is because not all fans register themselves as fans on social media sites. However, based on reports and social media sites, these fanbases can be presumed as having the biggest fan bases. BTS from South Korea  Image credit: en.wikipedia.org  This South Korean boy group has gained worldwide fans (also called BTS Army) that come from the all four corners of the globe; from the U.S., Brazil, Thailand, South Korea, Mexico, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The last country, Philippines, have the most BTS fans. This big fanbase can be proven by the number of RTs, and engagement they have obtained from social media sites, such as Twitter, Facebook and others. One BTS Tweet typically gets retweeted from thousands and near to a million within a few minutes. They have invaded Billboard as well, for topping the Billboard Social 50 Chart. Their song dominated this chart for 48 weeks. Recently, they were also accorded the Top Social Artist award at the Billboard Music Awards and the first Asian Band to be on the Top 10 of Billboard 200. To date BTS has 15.6 million followers on Twitter, more than 5,062,055 subscribers on their YouTube channel, BANGTANTV. There are millions of views for each video. That\u2019s why I ranked BTS as #1 because there are still millions of unaccounted BTS fans around the world that are not officially members of any BTS fan club. Here\u2019s their most popular video, \u201cFake Love\u201d. BTS (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) 'FAKE LOVE' Official MV If social media is our basis for the number of fans, the other music personalities with the biggest fanbases are Katy Perry (11o M Twitter followers), Justin Bieber (107 M Twitter followers), Rihanna (89 M Twitter followers), Taylor Swift (85.6 M Twitter followers), and Lady Gaga (79 M Twitter followers). For rock bands, Guns N\u2019 Roses has 6.37 M Twitter followers, the most so far, of the legendary bands. Aerosmith has only 2.07 M, while Journey has 246 K, and Def Leppard has 785 K. Being a singer, I hope someday I would gain as much followers as these phenomenal performers. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the request. The answer here is that CURRENTLY the biggest fanbase in the world is BTS\u2019s fanbase named- ARMY- (All caps, cause we\u2019re not military\u2026 though some ARMYs have served their respected countries and we respect the armed forces enough to use BigHits trademarked fanbase name) Stands for Adorable. Representative. M.C. for Youth. We\u2019re the biggest fandom on the planet and we\u2019re still gaining members. We are also the most active fanbase in the world as well. We engage with each other, BTS, and even other musicians on a daily basis. Something related to BTS trends at least twice a day and this is just on twitter. They\u2019ve beaten every record\u2026 hell they set a record and beat themselves. The exact number is unknown but considering how global they are, it\u2019s safe to say ARMY is well over the over 22 million who follow them just on twitter. They also beat the Beatles record for most #1 albums in 2 years(Beatles had 4 number 1 albums in just under 2 years, BTS hit that sooner with 4 Album in under 2 years), and they got the same record as the Beatles for same number of Albums in 1 year( 3 #1 albums to be exact). Hope this helps. And again, thanks for the request. ",
