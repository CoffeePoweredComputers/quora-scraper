            "answer_text": "Original Question: Isn't Moses technically the first human in the Bible? Technically? Do you mean as mentioned in the order of the books in the current Bible? If so, no, that\u2019s Adam in Genesis 2:20. Moses doesn\u2019t appear until Exodus 2:10. Do you mean as mentioned in the order in which the books of the Bible were written? If so, again no, no-one is certain which of the books was written first, but it was either Amos, Hosea, 1st Isaiah, or Micah, all written in either the late 8th century BCE or the early 7th century BCE. Neither Genesis nor Exodus was written until the 6th century BCE. But\u2026 Neither Moses nor Adam were real people. They\u2019re both entirely mythical and both of them are contained in entirely mythical stories written by Judahite scribes at the time of the Babylonian Exile and at least in part being adaptations of much earlier myths from Mesopotamia. Adam wasn\u2019t even a person in the original Hebrew texts of Genesis, his name being a later anthropomorphisation of the Hebrew word adamu meaning \u201cof the earth\u201d, the story being of how the ignorant people of the time believed that life on Earth arose. It was perhaps being written to remind the Judahite people who were in lifelong exile of their cultural and theological beliefs relating to their believed creation. The entirely mythical story of the Exodus was most likely written to give the same Judahites in lifelong exile, a sense of hope that one day a heroic character, Moses, would arise who would lead them back to their homeland. It was probably set at an undefined time in Egypt so that the Judahite\u2019s Babylonian captors wouldn\u2019t see the story\u2019s real meaning, that only being understood by the Judahites themselves. No evidence for any part of the story has ever been found. So sorry, Moses most certainly wasn\u2019t the first human in the Bible; he wasn\u2019t even a real human, just a fictional one\u2026 The first (earliest) person in the Bible for whom there\u2019s any non-biblical evidence is the Egyptian Pharaoh Shishak (also known as Sheshonq 1) who ruled in the 10th century BCE and who is mentioned in 1 Kings, written in the 7th century BCE.

            "answer_text": "No. Although Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible, he is not mentioned in the story until the second chapter of Exodus. There is no reason to believe that he was the first human by either a Biblical or historical perspective. Note that in the book of Exodus before Moses is even mentioned, a list of names of his ancestors is mentioned first, not to mention the account of his parents who after they gave birth to him, hid him for 3 months to protect him from Pharaoh, who ordered all the Hebrew boys to be killed, and when they couldn't hide him any longer they put him in a basket and floated him down the river where Pharaoh\u2019s daughter found him and \u201cdrew him out\u201d of the water for which she gave him his name Moses which means \u201cdrawn out.\u201d ",
