            "answer_text": "People lack empathy for two main reasons. First, empathy can make a person vulnerable. With the usual exceptions, people have a natural desire to connect with others and fit in with groups. Empathy can help identify with others and this can be the beginning of bonding. Empathy does not guarantee, however, that one will actually be accepted by others. Individuals and groups have practical and selfish reasons for being unable or unwilling to reciprocate to the empathy of others. Empathy unbalanced by other social skills can look \u2018too eager,\u2019 overbearing or needy. Second, our postmodern society has far more demands on our empathy than any previous society the world has even known. With the advent of telecommunications, our reach beyond our immediate environment has gone from being exceptional and extraordinary to massive and ordinary. The average person today is exposed to more information about the world around them and demands for response from people and entities unknown than in previous societies. We are connected and have a greater social and even global awareness than ever. One effect of this is information overload. We literally cannot respond on an emotional level to the horrible slow motion atrocities happening in this place on the globe, the rapid and unbelievable events happening in that place, things happening locally that impact our lives, things happening nationally that may or may not impact our lives, our mothers cat, our father\u2019s medical conditions, our own work schedule, the upcoming wedding of a friend and the problem our kid is having at school and the demands of Quora. Humans are incredibly adaptive and we may not even notice that we are allocating our sympathy and worry and wonder and joy and concern and irritation all over the world for events ranging from pure abstraction (will Bitcoin continue to rise?) to relevant, but speculative (is this rice really organic? does it matter? it would be great if we had universal healthcare in the US like in Russia) to immediate and overwhelming (do I really have the qualifications for this job? am I a good parent?). Such pressing demands on our attention and particularly on our empathy can drain us in ways we can hardly understand and force us to prioritize our emotional capital in a number of ways from disciplining our internet usage to deciding not to give a crap about the problems in Argentina or focusing on our child instead of worrying about if we really need to get / would be able to get a better job in the near future. Our vulnerability to information overload and untested / unmeasured ability to prioritize our limited emotional capital can result in a lack of empathy towards others in our immediate social experience for the sake of focusing on ourselves. This can be seen as both reasonable and selfish, depending on how over extended a person is and the reasonableness / unreasonableness of social expectations. Sometimes we get irritated when people don\u2019t respond to our SMS instantly and conclude that others don\u2019t care anymore when in reality the person\u2019s phone may be switched off. Sometimes we get mad at others about politics that are a world away and have no immediate relevance to otherwise immediate relationships. Sometimes we are so engrossed in the \u201clikes\u201d high of social media (Facebook, Quora and others) that we neglect family and friends with more challenging and complex demands on our emotional state. The first and second reasons collide more often than not. To practice empathy, one needs to understand the state of their emotional capital, to shift emotional resources closer to the immediate and personal rather than the distant and abstract and to pay more attention to people rather than to devices. Generally speaking, if we are good at empathy in up close and personal situations, we will be better able to manage our \u2018extended\u2019 empathy for things farther away without having to resort to living in a cave or throwing away our mobile phones. Its a lot to ask, but the rewards are also pretty obvious. Better empathy results in better emotional health and a greater maturity in dealing with our own emotional response. We may become more accessible to others or, in some cases, more appropriately guarded in our emotional interaction with others - in both cases to have healthier relationships with greater understanding of personal space, our own emotional needs and those of others and a sense of confidence about what is worth caring about and what is not.

            "answer_text": "I read once, that empathy is actually a survival strategy. It makes sense if you think about it. I am not my sister, but when my sister is happy it\u2019s like I\u2019m happy. If my sister is upset, it feels almost as bad as when I\u2019m upset. If my sister is actively working towards something, then I do whatever it is in my power to do for her to be successful. Why? Because I\u2019m bonded to her, and the emotions she feels, I feel to a lesser extent with her. It\u2019s a hugely motivating force over which I have very little control. I suspect, that if push came to shove, I would be willing to give up my life if it meant hers would continue. The same is true for a lot of my family members. Biologically speaking, it means that my genes (or ones that are very similar to mine) continue on down the line. In a tribal sense, this also makes sense. If I sacrifice my life for the sake of the tribe, then the tribe (who are all genetically similar to me) will be able live, and continue to propagate, if not my genes exactly, then ones that are very similar. But, it seems to me, that a side effect of this system is that it works too well. We don\u2019t live in a tribal world anymore where the only people that we\u2019re likely to come across are the same people that we are distantly related to. I\u2019m not just bonded to family members, but too a bunch of other people that have come in and out of my life. This pesky bonding habit even seems to extend to animals and inanimate objects. When, my dogs stupidly attacked a porcupine up in the mountains, I not only willingly carried one of them for miles back down the side of it, but was paid almost $1000 dollars to get the hundreds of quills taken out. Why? Well, because their pain was my pain, and it felt horrible. But, what happens when you\u2019re in an environment where empathy backfires? Say, for an example an abusive parent who uses your tie with them as a tool for control/punishment. The type of parent, that might kill the pet rabbit you loved just to punish you for some minor transgression. Or, maybe you grew up in an area where there aren\u2019t enough resources, or there is war, and everyone is following the most primal/basic instinct that we have - survival. What if that survival comes at the expense of other people? If you\u2019re an empathetic person, then how do you justify that? In those environments trusting someone and empathizing with them can lead to you or the people you care about getting hurt. The ability to bond becomes more of a liability than anything else. In those situations you might learn to shut it off, and what\u2019s more you might even begin to develop contempt for the people who don\u2019t in order to justify your own continued existence. To you, they come across as weak, and deliberately out of touch with reality. You might also develop a highly refined ability for self-deception. It wasn\u2019t your fault that those people weren\u2019t smart enough to figure out that you were screwing them over. They should have been more like you, and the other survivors. In fact, maybe that abusive parent killed that pet rabbit, in the hopes that it would toughen you up to make sure that you survived later on down the road. Then, what if someone were to step in, pull you out of that environment, and tell you that everything you ever learned about people and how to relate to them is wrong. All of the social codes/rules of interaction you ever learned don\u2019t work, and in fact they make you into what society deems to be a bad person. What do you do then? Suddenly up is down, left is right, forwards is backwards, and nothing makes sense. If I were lucky to be smart enough to figure out how to adapt and get by, it would always be with the sense that I was an impostor in a world built for people not quite like me. If I wasn\u2019t, or if I was too set in my ways to change, well, then I might just go on preying on people. ",
