            "answer_text": "Let me tell you my story regarding your question. Atually not mine, but his: When I was a kid, I always hang around my mothers family that lives in the countryside. That was one of the greatest gifts life could offer to me. I had an uncle that loved everything about life. He was so eager to do exciting things. He clearly was a **badass** in my eyes. The thing is, he was paralyzed from the chest down. The story goes like this: In the year that I was born (he was 25yo) , he had quite a stupid accident at work. He was on a night watch at some factory. There were two guys guarding the place: my uncle and another dude. Around midnight, the other guard thought that it was ok to play with his gun. It wasn\u2019t! He shot my uncle accidently in the spine and from that moment on, he couldn\u2019t walk ever again. I remember every day spent with him was so fun and beautiful. My grandma\u2019 was taking care of him and everybody loved him. He was quite a complicated person because he demanded so manny things from life. There wasn\u2019t anything that could stop him. My family modified a quad, so he can ride it. One day he left in the morning and came back 150 miles after (around 12h). I know it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but it truly was for him. He was smiling a lot, making a lot of shitty sexual jokes, that I could not understand at that time. I always felt I was more mature at 12yo, than him at 37. We fought a lot. I would always tease him with so many things, knowing he can\u2019t get up ( I was a stupid kid ). Now, that I think about it, he was my best friend. He really was my best friend. We insulted each other. We had deep talks about life. We played a lot ( every game you can think of that can be played by lying in the bed ). I\u2019m so angry right now because I\u2019m not the best writer in the world and I can\u2019t portrait him in his joyful, glorious complexity. And I\u2019m so angry that I took him for granted. I never thought that he\u2019ll go away, even though my mother always told me to appreciate the time I spend with him more. So.. Here comes that day. It was springtime. I remember repairing and tweaking something on my bike, like a lot of 14 year olds do. As I was outside, I heard a quiet crying inside the house that started to be more and more obvious. I rush in his room and everything seemed odd. He said to me that he was going to die. I remember it clearly: \u201c**I\u2019m dying and this time I\u2019m sure about it! **\u201c. Even though he was crying and beeing serious, I could not believe him. I remember saying that he\u2019ll be fine and to not worry about. At that moment, he calmed down. Two days later, when I was home (not at my grandparents), he was feeling sick and my grandma\u2019 called for an ambulance. He was rushed to the hospital where he died two days later because of a renal blockage. I can\u2019t get out of my head the sadness he expressed 4 days before he passed away. He wanted so much to live and do exciting things. I\u2019m so sad that I did not believe him in that moment. That I didn\u2019t say to him that I loved him so much. That I was just standing there and thinking he is just a \u201csissy girl\u201d. I was so naive... And now he is gone for 8 years. He knew he was going to die, even though he was not feeling sick when he said it to me. He was not afraid of dying. He was sad that he couldn\u2019t enjoy life more. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you think that a person can know when they are going to die? Answer: Yes. It seems obvious that the terminally ill can know that they have little time left. But perhaps the more interesting question is can some individuals sense that they are going to die? My girlfriend (of nearly a dozen years) died in the Spring of last year from complications due to diabetes. For privacy reasons, let's call her Amy (not her real name). Amy was not at all in good shape when she was admitted to the hospital. It took a few weeks, but eventually she regained coherence and it looked liked she might recover. I'll admit though that I had my doubts. This time was different from all the last. From her hospital bed, Amy had a telephone conversation with her brother. I was in the room with her. During the conversation, Amy was very emotional, in tears, and told her brother several times that she was sorry, although she would not say why. I was to later find out first hand from her brother that Amy had never once apologized to him in her entire life. He questioned whether she had a sense that she was going to die. For the remainder of that day, Amy acted as if she expected to be released from the hospital in a few days. She was making plans. Knowing her as I did, I believe that she was in denial. That was the last night that Amy was coherent. In a few days, she was gone. I really do believe that Amy sensed that she was going to die, but there was no way that she could know for certain. That same last night, she told me some things that she's never told me before. She also told me that she loved me and asked me to tell her father and brother that she loved them. I did. So, I do believe that some people sense when they are going to die. However, I'm sure that there must be very many cases when an individual senses that they are going to die, but they recover. ",

            "answer_text": "Back in my much younger days, I was working as an orderly in a hospital, trying to keep the wolf from the door and accumulating sufficient resources to pay my grad school bills. I spent most of my time on a surgical floor, which is, on the whole, a good place to work in a hospital. The patients frequently were admitted looking pretty healthy and fit; they\u2019d get their appendix removed or their sinuses rearranged, or whatever malady needed cutting (woops! I meant resectioning), received a bit of help for a couple of days, and left again looking pretty healthy and fit. Then there was a lady, whom I shall call Cassandra* for reasons that will become obvious. She had her gall bladder removed. Nowadays, that\u2019s done with lasers as outpatient surgery, leaving nary a mark or scar. Back then, it required maybe four or five days of hospitalization followed by six weeks or so of rest at home. But it was considered routine with a relatively low risk of complications. However, when this middle-aged woman came out of recovery back to her room, she was convinced that she was going to die, and she declared that fact to anyone within hearing distance. The staff took her very seriously. Granted, medical diagnostics have made huge strides in the meantime, but it wasn\u2019t exactly the Middle Ages. No one could find anything wrong with her. Nurses told me that Cassandra\u2019s skin was a little clammy, but nobody found a heart problem. Still, she insisted that she was on her way out. Note that, as I remember it, Cassandra was asserting her imminent death and wasn\u2019t asking for any treatment, whether general or specific. She just knew it was about to happen. I went home after my shift contemplating her curious behavior, but work on an MA thesis was waiting for me, and she dropped out of my mind for the rest of the evening. When I reported for work the next morning, Cassandra wasn\u2019t there any longer. She had passed away. To the best of my knowledge, and I must qualify that I didn\u2019t have an inside track with the doctors, a physical reason for her death was never clearly identified. Did Cassandra have a specific medical reason for predicting her own death? I don\u2019t think so. If she had one, surely she would have told the staff who were desperately looking for the cause of her mindset. Did she feel something non-specific in her body that triggered an awareness of imminent death in her mind? Possibly, but, if so, it was something that she was unable communicate to nurses and doctors. Did Cassandra have a mystical insight into her condition based on a spiritual intuition? Even though it was a Catholic hospital, those matters were beyond the capacity of the medical staff to evaluate, and they did their best to try to help her. Is it possible to just plain will yourself to death? Once more, I\u2019m clueless, and I don\u2019t think, from what little material that was accessible, that she would have had a glaring reason to do so. That\u2019s one experience that seems to support the idea that some people can know that they are on the verge of death without plausible external reasons to confirm their claim, except when it is too late. It was all just a little on the spooky side. *Cassandra is a woman out of Greek mythology who was cursed with the ability to make true prophecies that no one would believe. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I have never died (thank God!) so I cannot attest to this. All sarcasm aside, I have had three relatives pass away, two whom I was very close to, whom I believe had \u201cpremonitions\u201d before their death. For example, I had a cousin who died in a car wreck on her way from Texas to California for college. Prior to leaving, she made sure she saw all of the family & friends she could & gave many of them personalized cards telling them how thankful she was for them in her life, etc. She was 19 when she died this & prior to this had told many in the family that she felt she would not live a long life\u2014hence why she followed her dream to go off to college in California. My mother died unexpectedly 3 days after Christmas. Prior to her death, she made it a point to travel out of state to visit family she had not seen in years (normally her Christmases were just spent at home with close family). She also made amends with my maternal grandmother whom she had had a rocky relationship with. Do I believe she felt something was off & she may be leaving the Earth soon? Yes. The last one is my maternal grandmother who became ill unexpectedly & placed on life support (ie she was intubated but was fully conscious). I stayed with her for almost 2.5 months as my mother had died alone & my maternal grandmother was terrified to die alone. I was going to make sure that did not happen to her. Two days before her telling me she was \u201cready to go\u201d (ie to come off the breathing machine) she wrote that she wanted all the family to gather. I have an 88 year old grandmother who was once this grandmother\u2019s mother in law. My maternal grandmother insisted she see her. My great grandmother arrived from a 5 hour drive on a Wednesday morning to stay the night in the ICU with us. The next morning my maternal grandmother woke up & wrote \u201cI am ready to go.\u201d Whatever it was that gave her the peace she needed to move on had arrived. So yes, I do believe in premonitions.

            "answer_text": "I have had very vivid, morbid dreams since I was about four years old. Sometime in the early months of 2018, I had another strange dream. I was sitting in my bath tub alone. The lighting was very dim and unusual. It had somewhat of a blueish hue to it. I was sitting with my knees pulled up to my chest and my arms wrapped around my knees as if I was hugging my legs. I looked down and noticed that I was sitting in roughly two inches of dark, red blood instead of water. Then I started to look around me at the walls of the bath tub. There was blood smeared all over in a fashion that looked like someone with bloody hands had been aimlessly grabbing at the walls. I remained very calm and never spoke a word during the dream for some unknown reason, and then I woke up. Fast forward to November of 2018. I had found out at the end of September that I was pregnant with my second child. When I returned for a check up in the beginning of November, no heartbeat could be found on the ultrasound. My doctor determined the baby had died and opted to allow me to naturally miscarry at home. Before my second pregnancy with my son, my first pregnancy had been ectopic and was found, thankfully, on the morning of the same day my Fallopian tube ruptured resulting in emergency surgery to remove the tube. So, I had never experienced a natural miscarriage before. The doctor explained that there would be a much heavier blood flow than a person normally experiences with a period along with very painful cramping. I returned home very sad and nervous, but tried to accept the loss as best as I could. A few days later, while lying in bed, I felt a gush of blood and decided to go sit on my bathroom toilet to wait out the heaviest part of the bleeding. After about twenty minutes, blood was still pouring out of me like a faucet had been turned on. I climbed in the bathtub because I was starting to feel very weak and the toilet had filled with more blood than I could handle seeing. All of a sudden, blood clots the size of baseballs started coming out along with the steady flow of bright, red blood. The blood clots clogged the drain of the bath tub, and the tub started to fill up blood. Flashbacks of the dream I had earlier in the year filled my mind. I started to feel so weak and lightheaded that I couldn't hold my body up any longer, and I ended up slumped over the side of the tub. I began to lose feeling in my hands, arms and legs. At that point, I told my boyfriend to call 911. I was taken to the emergency room by ambulance, still bleeding and passing even larger clots the whole time. When my vitals were taken, my blood pressure was 60/40. I was rushed in for an emergency D and C. The doctor told me later on that she had to sweep my uterus seven times to clear all of the clots and other matter from inside. If I had waited thirty more minutes to call for help, I would have bled to death before having time to get the D and C. I'm also very fortunate that the incident happened on a Sunday. If it had happened on a week day, my boyfriend would have been at work and I may have fainted before being able to get to my phone to call for help. My two year old son could have been alone in the house with my dead body for hours. The doctor still does not know what caused this to happen, as I tested negative for ectopic and molar pregnancy. I truly believe that my dream was a prediction of my possible death, so I see no reason why other people couldn't have the same experience in one way or another. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know. I don't even know how we could test all situations for that; not all deaths are the same. There is probably something at the neurobiological level playing a role. I don't know if it would be similar across the different ways to die; is it different in a medically assisted death as opposed to stroke or heart attack and is it different still for someone who has struggled with cancer or other chronic disease? I really don't know, but I am following this question in case someone out there does. I CAN speak from some personal experience; but nothing I have learned can actually answer your question; at LEAST not in a way that provides 1 solid answer. I have been resuscitated on 3 different occasions; it was a different feeling immediately prior to each time. My experience with death have all been drug related; once was a result of a bad reaction to anesthesia. I knew I was dying for different reasons, I had different feelings, but I knew death was coming. The only consistent thing was the feeling of being dead. It was always this dark emptiness where all you have are your thoughts. The first time I knew I was dying / losing all vital signs. My body just felt heavy. I knew I was dead when I couldn't hear anybody, everything was black and everything was gone. I just got to heavy to stand, then too heavy to keep my eyes open, then everything went away. The second time I knew I was dying when I could actually feel that my heart wasn't doing a good job, I lost control of my limbs, I tried to talk to get help, but I couldn't. I just slowly got lower to the ground and when I got to the ground, before it went black, it felt as though I had knives in my heart and lungs; I remember feeling terrified and feeling relieved when the darkness came. The most recent time I felt a freezing move up my body from the waist to the head. The freezing sensation then went in all the orifices of my head and froze my brain heart and lungs. Once again I was paralyzed and couldn't even get a whisper out to warn the doctors in the room. (This is the time I died in surgery ) I was a again in the black space. This time I had a 3 year old at home and I was living a good lifestyle, being good to myself and others. All i could think about was not being able to be with my child and also about him not having his dad. It was the probably the worst I felt in my life \u2014 and I was technically dead. My emotions were never as crushed as they were in those brief moments; which felt like eternities. I have never been so happy to see people as I was to see all the medical staff, plus about 5 extras that weren't there before, all welcoming me back. It changed me. So I guess I kind of answered your question. I know I am dead when my consciousness gets trapped in a place where the only thing that exists are my thoughts and emotions. I would imagine that if the thoughts and the feelings were to go away the same way my senses did, then that would be when I would know I couldn't be brought back. But in terms of there being one moment when someone knows; I think they just know. But this is something we can't test because we can't actually ask a dead person how they knew; and no family would allow their dying loved one to have their brains wired up to make sure we can capture all the data at the time of death. I really don't know. I think it's different for everybody. I had really never thought of it. The question I have thought of is this; If I had been a believer in any sort of divine afterlife; would my experience in the dark zone have been something different? I have heard other accounts of people being brought back to life that were drastically different than mine \u2014 If we were to have switched beliefs about deaths; would our experience after death have also switched with our beliefs? I have just completed a course in palliative care; I asked those questions in class and I think I melted everyone's brains. I wish I could leave you with a better answer; rather than just some of the questions that plague me on a daily basis. I use to not question it as much; but now I work with people who are dying, so it gives me more motivation to think about that kind of stuff. I would ask Quora those questions\u2014 but it seems as though questions involving theism vs atheism seem to go a bit sideways here. Anyway; I hope this helped in some way. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. When I was in Vietnam in 1966 I was an assistant machine gunner. My gunner\u2019s name was \u201cLittle\u201d Jimmy Smith. He was the smallest Marine in the battalion. He humped that M-60 all day without a whimper. He sometimes carried other guys gear in addition to his own. We were moving through the \u201cArizona Territory\u201d south of Da Nang. Elephant grass 6 to 8 feet tall, cut you like a knife. We always rolled our sleeves down before moving through this stuff. It was about 1045 & already hotter than hell. Units ahead of us were getting in firefights as close as 2 yards apart. Earlier that morning Jimmy had said to me, \u201cPerk, I\u2019m gonna\u2019 die today\u201d. I told him to shut the fuck up & not talk like that. Around 1105 the gooks opened fire on us. Smitty and I, along with 2 ammo bearers moved up. Smitty was giving a base of fire in support of other grunts who were moving on line. His last belt was getting short & I turned around to get another can of ammo. While I had my back turned the gun stopped firing. When I turned around\u2026..Smitty was laying on his right side with blood pumping out of his carotid artery. He was looking me in the eyes & the look seemed to say, \u201cSee I told you so!\u201d. There was nothing I could do but watch my friend die. I couldn\u2019t pinch off the artery because blood is too slippery & I couldn\u2019t get a grip on it. I screamed for \u201cDoc\u201d. The corpsman arrived and tried to put a clamp on it. It was too late and Smitty died. S/F Marines! Gunny Perkins ",

In cases where the person is in hospital, a doctor may tell him that he might, or even will, die from the malady. Others know it interiorly. How seems to vary. Some people are informed by an interior voice, like Gerard Majella. I recall reading, when or where escapes me at the moment, of a man who stepped off the curb, intending the cross the street, fell backwards, hit his head on that curb, and died. The evidence for such events being foreknown by that man seems to indicate, death, as it were, took him by surprise! I DID have a strange experience in one case! I was busy drafting, these were the days before computers and AUTOCAD, when a new person was hired. He seemed an elderly gentleman. There was not much speech between us for that first week. We were too busy! I learned at bit during those days, however. He was an older gentleman, probably late 50\u2019s or early 60\u2019s, had a family, had fled, I think it was Guatemala with his family, where he was a well-known architect. His family consisted of wife, son and daughter. On that last day, of course I had no idea of what was going to happen, we spoke extensively. One thing I recall him saying, had to do with his youth. As a young child he would often serve the Mass. On those days he would call the people to Mass by ringing on of the large bells in the Church tower. All one had to do was pull on a rope in order to produce the sound. This ne enjoyed immensely! We had gotten back to silence and work, when someone came up the stairs, [we were in a room on the second floor], and remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s like a church in here!\u201d I had felt too\u2014like a strange stillness, like the presence of Angels! Soon it was lunchtime. I had brought mine with me, but Felix, [for that was his first name], but Felix had given his prepared lunch to his son, and went out of the office in order to get something to eat at one of the nearby restaurants and eateries. He never came back! We were told later that as he walked on the sidewalk, a crazed individual drove his truck up onto that sidewalk, killing Felix and injuring another! From the office windows we could see a body covered by some kind of cloth. Remembering our last conversation, and the remark made by that visitor, even today, can give me the shivers! Although there is no evidence that Felix knew he would die that day, someone did! ",

One morning, when I was 17, he emphatically told me to swing by his house before I went to school. He was boarding a flight to Florida that day to spend the week looking at horses to buy. I got to his house, and he said \u201cI need to show you something.\u201d He took me to his front closet, and in the sleeve of his raincoat was $5,000 cash. He said, \u201cIf anything happens to me, you take this, this is yours, and don\u2019t you tell anyone about it.\u201d I kind of laughed and said \u201cPapa! What do you think, your plane is gonna crash or something?!\u201d He said \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s just in case.\u201d I kind of rolled my eyes like \u201cSure\u2026\u201d A few days later, on 2/11/2009, I came home from school, and when I got upstairs to my room I saw out the window that a police car had just pulled up out front. Sure enough, the officer started walking towards my house, and I went down to open the door. \u201cAre you related to Raymond? It seems he may have passed away down in Florida.\u201d My heart sank. It was my absolute worst nightmare. I later found out that he\u2019d been complaining of chest pains to his friends, and that he was supposed to go to the doctors, but decided to reschedule for when he got back from his trip. He knew he wouldn\u2019t make it back. ",

They usually feel but it's typically not painful and if it is it's for a short while. Usually upon decease they immediately can't remember because they instantly feel energy. I know this from personal experience since I flatlined a few years ago. I was actually pissed they brought me back. However, I knew why. Wasn't done with my duty here on Earth yet. And yes, it is explained by entities of your existence, the things you've done in your life and if you've completed your mission here. If you didn't, they send you back in one way or another. By that I mean either you wake up in the same body or are reborn in another. If you are accepted to be ready on the other side you are always given the opportunity to return, it wasn't my preference but I wasn't accepted on the other side since my mission had not yet been completed. And yes, you DO see your loved ones on the other side. However, just so you are aware, if you are considering suicide you are almost guaranteed to have to return and often right where you left off in your previous life, so I don't recommend it. There are few exceptions to that, as there are exceptions to everything, however, that is not a gamble I would make. It is an outright law to not do so, and yes, there ARE laws about that on the other side. If you would like to know about my personal experience, I would be happy to say\u2026 .. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember that in 1987 I heard that the daughter and granddaughter of some very dear friends was ill. Nobody gave me any details, but I must have overheard that Stacy was rather ill. She was just about the most perfect young lady I'd ever met \u2014 an exceptional student, a very caring and friendly soul. She was 15 years old. On July 4th I was playing in a small band with her father and grandfather when she turned up to listen to the end of our little recital. This was in California, where I lived for about 20 years. I'm English and was probably the only Englishman she knew. She absolutely loved asking me about England and asked whether I would be visiting that year. I told her that, yes, the next week I would fly to England and spend a couple of months there. She said that she would love to go and I replied that it was too late that year to organise anything for her, but the next year, if her parents would pay her airfare she could come with me and I'd show her round the UK. She replied that it would be lovely, but she wouldn't be able to go as she was going to die in six months. She didn't say \u201cabout six months\u201d but just \u201csix months\u201d. Note that this was July 4. I couldn't believe it \u2014 she looked so well \u2014 but she lifted her curls and showed me an enormous scar almost right round her head. She told me that she was dying of brain cancer. I was absolutely horrified! The next day I bought her a lovely book of photographs of the UK. I saw her from time to time over the autumn and saw her grandfather every Wednesday evening, as we played in the same orchestra together. He kept me updated as to Stacy's condition. On Christmas Day I was invited to a big party at his home \u2014 there were about 15 guests, and about 5.00pm he told me that, if I wanted to see Stacy, I should go to her house straight away. When I arrived I was very distressed. She had had a severe stroke, caused by the tumor, was paralysed except for one hand and arm, blind, unable to speak, as her throat was paralysed, but she knew my voice so I sat next to her and held her hand. She kept stroking my hand and fingers, then, to try to comfort me, over and over again, she would lift my hand to her lips and kiss my hand. I was with her for a little over an hour. On my 47th birthday, ten days later (4th January 1988) she died. Exactly six months to the day from July 4th. Today, 31 years later, I still can't forget that dreadful episode. She was 15 years old.

            "answer_text": "Yes. I believe this to be true. My Grandma actually wrote a note in the hospital telling everyone she loved them but she was dying. She had been doing fine, and she took a crazy turn and deteriorated rapidly. My Mom told me and my Dad she was ready to go, she did not want to live the way she had been. She had told my Dad two weeks prior, \u201cwell this is all water under the bridge now\". As soon as I heard her tell me she was ready, I knew she would not get better. My sister, and this is the hardest, because she is the youngest sibling. She was an alcoholic, she had been sober, relapsed, and been sober again. Our Mom died 3 months ago and my sister had been taking it hard. I would call her, and maybe get a hold of her once a week. Well, the day before she passed, she actually called me back on my way to work. She told me that she was having trouble eating, and we talked. I had to head to work, and I told her I would call her soon. She assured me she was ok. Just not able to eat. The next night my Dad called and said she had died. He told me she seemed upbeat after we spoke. It made me feel a little better that we had talked and I know that she knows I cared. We had not talked a lot due to her drinking and me being sad that she was doing bad. I believe she knew that she was not doing well, and she called me, and felt ok because I would always answer her and I cared. So, yes, I believe most people know when they are going to pass. ",

He helped me overcome my anxiety,my fear of failure . He believed in me and genuinely praised me (I've never been praised, not even by my parents). Three days before he died was our last lesson. We only chated actually ,he asked: what will you do if you fail? I answered :move on and keep trying. And then told me he was really happy that I was his last student. He always told me a quote from the Odyssey \u201cwhat's important is the journey, not the destination \u201c. My parents went there the next day (my mother worked there ) he told her ,that now I am capable of living a fulfiling life and that I will definitely find my way and become the best person I can. Also he told her to tell me goodbye ,that's when my mom and I knew he wouldn't have long. She also witnessed him holding the bible while sleeping,crying and praying a lot. Next day I experienced my first death in my adolescent life. When my mother called me to tell me that the person that helped me overcome my depression and anxiety died. I felt my knees cut in half. The air suddenly became very heavy and I couldn't breathe. I cried my heart out for hours . I never really knew that death was so sudden and awkward,how a human could just stop existing. Nothing prepares you for it. So ,as far as i know,yes people know when they will die,at least a week before. P.S. I forgot to mention that he wasn't very religious,that's why my mom realise it when he was praying and holding the bible. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways in which it is possible to know when you will die, though how accurate such knowledge turns out to be is another matter. For example, there's a cheerful website which allows you to calculate your own life expectancy based on factors such as weight and alcohol consumption. The result is conveniently displayed on the face of a gravestone and a death clock allows you to see the remaining seconds of your life pass away as you watch. Apparently I have just four years to go but I'm not unduly worried because the date given for my death is the mean average for a wide range of possible dates. A month ago I visited someone in hospital, the doctors having told him and his wife that he would never come out. It is possible to know the approximate date of your death by medical diagnosis, though in the case of my friend he's out of hospital and slowly recovering. If you really wanted to achieve greater accuracy than that available from doctors, you could determine the date of your own death by devising a plan to commit suicide, though not all such attempts are successful. One further possibility for knowing when you will die is receiving a premonition of death. Although this sounds spooky, its more about a spontaneous intuition which is in itself a common experience - sometimes we get to know a thing without being aware of how we know it. A woman I used to talk to quite regularly had a strong premonition that she would die at a certain age and it caused her a great deal of anxiety. She believed that she had been cursed and could not overcome her fear in spite of counselling. Although stories of such intuitions proving to be true are relatively common, many who have them do not die at the age foretold. In general, intuitions can be helpful, especially in the making of decisions, but they are not necessarily reliable and need to be tested by a good reasoning process. So, yes, there are a number of ways in which I can know when I will die but for various reasons this is not a certain knowledge. The point for me is that I could be run over by a bus as I cross the road tomorrow morning. My life is finite and therefore I need to use the time I have left, not simply as well as I can but in ways that contribute to the joy, care and well-being of others. ",

So, yes, some know. Curiously, they were all at peace with their coming death. I've also had a patient will himself to die. He and his wife come to the hospital, him having multiple symptoms, but he looked in good health and walked without difficulty. He was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I don't remember what kind of cancer, but it was sure to be a drawn out, painfully long death. His wife doted on him and he was equally concerned about her and how his illness would affect her. He expressed this worry to at least three nurses and a couple of other staff. He said that he didn't want her to suffer the pain of his slow death. This was on a Friday. He died on Monday. Remember, he walked into his hospital room and climbed in bed without assistance. I'm convinced he willed himself to die, out of love for his wife. They were a beautiful couple, their love for each other plain to see. ",

            "answer_text": "We do not know our death time, therefore you shall be always prepared to face death in the next moment!! The effort in achieving the grace of the Lord is the most important goal of human life. This point will be realized when the human being is in the last minute of this life cycle because at that time of juncture, the upper world starts appearing practically to the eyes through the arrived messengers of Lord. Unfortunately there will be no time for spiritual effort at that juncture, even though realization comes. God told me the following two verses and asked me to memorise these two verses ten times a day so that the mind will be fixed on God. The first verse means \u2018At the time of death the last knowledge dawns to the mind by which the human being realizes that for those whom he has spent his energy and lifetime, are unable to protect him from that moment onwards. The Lord who can protect is not arriving then because no time and energy was spent for Him\u2019. The second verse means \u2018When the time was there, this realization did not come and when the realization came, there is no time. By this the human being undergoes silent suffering, which is the agony\u2019. Lord told me that every human being will be given this last knowledge and this agony in the last couple of moments. I started remembering these verses every day ten times and the result of their memory is this wonderful divine knowledge. When the soul embedded by subtle body leaves the gross body in death, there will be inconvenience in the exit of the soul. This inconvenience gives some pain because the soul was so far attached to properties(welath) earned by it and to its family members. To leave all these in one instance permanently gives lot of pain. That is the last minute in which the fascination to wealth and family exists, which is known by the soul in death. As much fascination you develop with these worldly bonds in your life, so much will be the pain! The inconvenience in leaving the gross body is just like removing a tight shirt from the body. The fascination developed to this gross body is this inconvenience, which also joins the pain. The two names of the gross body as deha and sharira always remind you that one day the gross body gets destroyed. Deha means that which is burnt in fire (dahyate iti). Sharira means that which decomposes into five elements in case the body is not burnt and buried (shiryate iti). Whenever, you refer your gross body, you must use these two words so that your fascination to it does not grow much. Apart from the above said pain, lot of intense pain is also developed as I explained in two verses above regarding the last flash of intelligence and last agony subsequently developed. This pain is far greater than the pain received by soul due to the inconvenience in relieving itself from gross body. To understand this clearly, I give an example: One person is travelling in a bus, which was crowded much and the person felt lot of inconvenience and pain in the journey. After reaching the next city, he attended an interview in which he failed since he could not answer any question. While travelling also, he knows very well that he is zero in the subject and will certainly loose the interview. He is attending the interview forced by his parents and hence the journey is inevitable. The pain caused due to inconvenience in the journey is far lesser than the future pain imagined due to certainty in loss of coming interview. Hence, the pain in the inevitable death is far lesser than the pain to be received in the hell in the immediate future due to absence of protection from God, whom the soul never cared. The cared family cannot protect the soul in the hell. Knowledge of this topic and its frequent memory in life will help any soul in developing care to God and in reducing fascination to these worldly bonds. The state at your death continues after that also Even after death, a bonded soul remains bonded with this world only and such soul wanders between hell, heaven and earth only Remember that you can\u2019t achieve anything extra after death. Whatever you attained while you are alive here, that much only follows you after death also. If you got salvation from worldly bonds and caught God in human form here, you are a liberated soul and you will be attached with God in energetic form also in the upper world since energetic incarnation is the same human incarnation. If you are fascinated to worldly bonds here, you are not a liberated soul after death also and continue with the same worldly fascinations. Due to the severe fascination to worldly bonds here, you will wander on this earth as an evil spirit (ghost) only. Since you have neglected the human incarnation, you can\u2019t be attached in the energetic form of God there due to same repulsion of common media. Hence, death has no specialty, which is like a gate between here and there. Therefore, learn the truth and follow the spiritual path here itself to attain anything here itself while you are alive. If you are misguided to think that something different will be achieved by you after death, you are simply fooled. Even after death, a bonded soul remains bonded with this world only and such soul wanders between hell, heaven and earth only. ",

            "answer_text": "It's hard to be sure that someone suffering End Stage Dementia (or any other mental issues that separates reality from delusions) is aware they are dying. It is reasonable to assume that the brain (somewhere in there) is capable of detecting game-ending circumatances or a fatality. The brain therefore begins dealing, as best it can, with the fact that systems are failing in such a way that there is no winnable strategy to keep the body alive no matter what the brain commands in its attempts to compensate for organ failures or other losses. Someone who's been in a car crash and is awake and cognitive enough to understand that their leg is behind their head, their arm is completely gone, their guts are hanging out, and the car they were driving is wrapped around a pole\u2026 then yes, that person can probably reason out that they have a small chance of survival. Then there is the prisoner who is strapped to a table waiting to be put to death by lethal injection. That person knows they are dying because there is no reason other than an impending death for them being in that situation. If people who are calmly lying in bed, waiting for the end to come, is what you mean\u2026 I believe they know they are dying but the \u201cknowing\u201d takes different shapes, I think. Some stories draw a picture of the dying taking on a meditative state - purposely \u201changing on\u201d until the favorite pregnant niece shows up to say goodbye. Some other stories show the dying spilling some pertinent truth just before expiring. I believe people \u201cknow\u201d they are dying just like people know they're about to throw up and / or pass out. You know. ",

My dad was in his 80s broken hearted. I would go there 4 days a week. Stay there. We talked so much about life. He told me lots abought when he was a soldier. I sat up many night listening to music. Watching tv documentaries. We had a special friendship. But he was Really missing his wife. He used to write her letters in his dairy. My sister used to visit and his sister who lived in USA. So dad was never without company. But when he was 90 he knew life was passing by. We talked about death in a positive way. He said he didn\u2019t want to live to 100. He was an amazing man. He was respectful, he wanted the best for his daughters through life. Worked hard paid bills. Loved racing and always joking about things. I think this was the positive way he was. He always content and positive and grateful of life. Loved planting flowers . Love nice food. Loved company. He was chatty. He didn\u2019t want to die he was so much loving life. In his 90 his eyes started to fail. Up until then he could still read without glasses. Read 100s of library book. He used to say I\u2019m fine I can still see my beautiful daughters. He had a nun come round visit him from church. He died one sunny morning birds were singing. We will miss him but the time I spent with him taught me so much. He used to say to me (every thing will happen at the right time) don\u2019t wait for things to happen. Be patient. Sadly missed. Saying goodby was hardest part. But death comes to us all. Appreciate what you have. Enjoy the time you have. ",

Stephen Hawking was not expected to see his 25th birthday.  The first two examples that I gave are tragic. While, the third one, as you might know isn\u2019t; since Stephen Hawking is well and alive these days. Now, death is something we all fear. And it\u2019s natural to do that. But what\u2019s the use of knowing our death date beforehand? Is it going to decrease our fear? Are we going to be able to do something about it? No, you can\u2019t do anything about it. In fact, if I tell you that you\u2019re going to die at the age of so and so years, you\u2019ll get tensed and overcome by grief. You\u2019ll feel that it\u2019s not enough time. You\u2019ll hate yourself for not using your past life in a judicious way. This is what patients with terminal illnesses experience. Tragedy, grief, sadness etc. Out of a hundred such people, only one or two are able to get over it, and live their leftover life to the fullest. Randy Pausch is one such example. Do watch this video:  The point I\u2019m trying to make is that it is absolutely useless for us to know the day we\u2019re going to die. It\u2019s much more beneficial and motivational to believe that you can die any second now. Death should be a pleasant surprise, not a burden for you to carry with you, your whole life. To quote Mahatma Gandhi: Live as if you were to die tomorrow, learn as if you were to live forever. A real piece of wisdom. Now, I\u2019d like to ask you a question: Do you want to know your death date? ",

One autumn morning, me being iconically stubborn, put on my shoes, and (literally) hobbled down the stairs, I then started throwing up and my heart rate went to 200bpm and a 40\u00b0C fever, I decided hesitantly perhaps maybe not go to work and go to the GP, so I got there and after a few tests, I was informed I could have sepsis, literally within minutes I started throwing off blood clots to my arteries and one in my spleen, so I was taken to hospital and had all the tests and antibiotics and 1001 questions, it took a few days for them to diagnose me. fast forward a bit and I had a heart surgery to repair the valve that was being eaten away by bacteria, and I do believe that if I didn't decide to go to the GP that morning and at that time on that day, and hadn't the blood thinners and antibiotics at that exact time, I'd be dead by now, fun fact; I don't have a pulse in my right arm!

I have seen many people at the end of their life, I have held the hand of many while they took their final breath. You absolutely know when you are going to die unless it\u2019s an acute event that happens in your sleep like a heart attack or a traumatic event like an accident. Even those there will be a few minutes when you will know you\u2019re dying. For me it\u2019s part of life and I have no fear of death. My mother planned her death, in fact she lived her entire life in preparation for her death. Her funeral, what she would wear in her coffin, what would be served at the funeral lunch. She spent her last few weeks in a wonderful hospice in Ireland with nurses she called her angles taking care of her. No fear that anyone could see, she held court with family and friends and passed away peacefully. Sad but not bad. I have witnessed people with terminal illnesses terrified of death, fighting it. Torturing themselves trying to avoid it, or worse their families torturing them trying to avoid it. You can\u2019t stop death when it\u2019s your time to go. Most people don\u2019t think about death much even when they know it\u2019s not going to be long. Children with terminal illness are amazing I\u2019ve seen them comforting parents family and friends. When your time is near you\u2019ll know. I wish you peace of mind when that time comes. ",

            "answer_text": "My mother was terminally ill with Cancer, and near the end. I had a 2 week family trip to National Parks planned, and told her I was canceling it. She promised me she would be OK, and insisted that I go. After a week she was in a hospice, and when I checked in with family members around Noon (this was before cell phones). I was told \u201cYou better get home now.\u201d I was in Marble Canyon, AZ with a broken down rental car. I was able to get another car at 3AM, driven from Salt Lake City (many thanks to National, sincerely), and got to Phoenix about 10AM. When checking my family of 4 in for the flight, the counter attendant said \u201cSorry, we are over booked. (I had reservations but had not yet purchased the ticket.) I did not say a word, he just looked at us, and said, \u201cLet me talk to my supervisor.\u201d We got on the flight. (Thank you Delta.) Now back to the point, during all of this, my mother would periodically wake up, and say \u201cIs Bill here yet?\u201d When my siblings said \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cOK, I will wait.\u201d She was choosing the time of her death. When I did arrive, she woke up to see all of us holding her hands, and sighed, and died soon thereafter. Yes, sometimes you know when you are going to die, and you can even choose to delay it, at least for awhile. ",

Usually when you're that sick, you don't mind dying. However, I did read about a Christian man (we'll call him Howard) who was in his 80's and received a message from God that he was going to die within several hours.  So he and his wife got the house 'company ready'.  Then she called all the family and close friends, inviting them to come on over and say goodbye, while he sat serenely in his easy chair in communion with God.  The family and friends began arriving, filing in line for a few last words with Howard in his living room.  He was alert and feeling well, in fact he had no illness or disease.  There was gracious communication and goodbyes with each guest.  When all were gone, his wife sat with him, her last minutes with the husband of her youth and her best friend in the world.  He gave her comforting words as they sat hand in hand, and then they just fell asleep. When she awoke, she looked at her Howard.  His head was against the back of his easy chair, and the look on his face was joyful and filled with peace.  She took his hand again, and it was cold.  Howard had peacefully passed on to Heaven while she dozed in the easy chair next to his. ",

My childhood friend Cassandra Cline was killed by an alligator in Hilton Head, South Carolina last year. She has 2 sisters, a mother and husband. My twin and I had to give messages to the family. Cassie told me she knew her time was coming. A few months before she passed, she told her husband that she was going before him. He's 13 years older than her. She told us to tell her family she wanted to be cremated. She wanted each one to have her ashes in a necklace locket. They granted her wish. Her family validated her messages. Cassie was talking about death and her leaving before everyone. It was like she was preparing them. She was the sweetest soul. She told me she's still a teacher in the dimension she's in. That death is just a new life. They needed her, that's why it was her time. Her family and husband are destroyed by her leaving. I pray for them everyday. R.I.P. beautiful angel. ",

He had half and threw the rest away. He wheeled himself into the living room, took off his glasses and hat and threw them in a chair. He then said\u2026thank you and passed. Onanother passing my dad asked me to get my siter whi had just left the hospital room to go home. I caught her at the elevator and said\u2019da wants you\u2019. When she got back to the room he gestured for a good nite kiss. She did so and left. She was not at the elevator and he was already gone. She had mussed the passing of another sibbling and it bothered her quite a bit so he made sure it didn\u2019t happen again. My brother was dying in the hospital but would not let go\u2026another brother was on his way from the other side of the country. The doctor said more than once\u2019i don\u2019t know whats keeping him alive\u2019. Soon as brother from across the country entered the hospital the ailing one passed away.

I mean not all people know the time of their death but some do know Some people have a very gr8 psychic ability and intuition power they r actually blessed by God\u2026 Personal experience-My mom was going through a surgery and that day she felt somewhat uneasy altho she had underwent several surgeries\u2026that day she felt like she literally gonna die she shared her feelings with me a 7th grade gal I was MOM INTEARS TOTALLY BROKEN\u2026 Howsoever she went in comma and was almost like a dead but it was an unnatural death so I think Goddesses ,people\u2019s prayers , namaz,temple visits, fast , cancellation of bdays had worked out And my mother was reborn n alive Benediction:) Latest example tho irrelevant in some way But Amitabh bacchhan sir on twitter shared about his feelings of uneasiness and then suddenly we heard of Sridevi's demise\u2026this is due to ability to absorb and interpret frequencies and sense aura vibes of a person to whom we are spiritually/emotionally connected\u2026 :\u2014) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. My uncle just died, a few days before his 87th birthday. He had been begging his only child, my cousin, to visit him, but she had a hip replacement and wasn\u2019t able to travel. They lived 300 miles apart. His wife was very concerned, he was weak and in pain and just kept praying for enough time to see his daughter. As soon as the doctor gave her the OK to travel, her husband drove her to her father\u2019s bedside. They talked for hours. They had breakfast together in the morning. She says, she gave him permission to go on. He seemed to need that from her. Then she got in the car and headed home. Fifteen minutes later, he died. He had just been holding it off so he could see her. This is one of several times when I have seen a person who clearly knew he or she was dying, and *needed* to accomplish something before they would let go. I am convinced that people do know when they\u2019re going to die. ",

She was dying and told my mom \u201c i would not mind going if it wasn't for Tony.\u201d When my mom took ill she spent her last 4 months at our house. She knew when she was going. She was telling everyone she loved them, then laid down and passed. 2019 my 26 year old son died of cancer. We had no idea he had cancer. Not sure if he knew or not. Luckily i was off work on short trem dissability. The morning we took him to the hospital, at this time he had already had a few surgeries, i had been staying with him. He was sitting in his chair and said\" it hurts.\u201d I said \u201c what hurts?\u201d He said \u201c this angel stuff.\u201d Also there is a book we got from hospurus that explains the stages of death. I forget the name. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that some people know that they are going to die. My paternal grandfather; left everything in order on his desk. That day he went fishing with a friend. He was suppose to throw out the one boat anchor. His friend was turning off the motor and throwing out the other one. As far as the family knew he was doing well health wise. He had a heart attack and he was gone. The family discovered all of his paperwork was in neat stacks with notes explaining different things that would need to be done. I believe he knew and just didn\u2019t want any of us to worry. With my second husband, I believe that he knew what was happening long before the problems started and didn\u2019t want me to worry. He was diagnosed with cancer and nineteen days later he was gone. After my second husband passed away; while preparing things for his memorial service, I found that he had left out several of things that I needed for the memorial service. I believe that our body\u2019s let us know when something isn\u2019t right. I believe that our brains get us started on doing some of the things that need to be done before we go. ",

Obviously I don\u2019t know either way, but first principles tells me that it\u2019s unlikely for the simple reason that there\u2019s usually no point to knowing. That\u2019s assuming it\u2019s not a warning of danger ahead, a possible death that might then be averted. That would be very useful. But knowing you only have a few moments left to live? There might be some circumstances where you might then take some action to save others. It doesn\u2019t require much bravery to give your life when you know it\u2019s just about over anyway. There is one thing that I\u2019m told is quite common, and in my mother\u2019s case it was certainly true. When people are very ill and on their deathbed, even if they\u2019re full of drugs and haven\u2019t been particularly together for some time, there\u2019s frequently a moment near the end where they become very lucid. Why this happens is unknown, but it\u2019s as if the body has a little bit of life energy stored up for the end, and when it\u2019s needed, just for a chance to tell loved ones goodbye, that\u2019s when it\u2019s released. Doctors might have a better explanation for that, but I personally don\u2019t think we need one. ",

It was a poem posing questions about heaven and included lines about all the pain he\u2019d had in his life, asking if heaven was more fun than earth, an apology to his parents standing by his casket, and concluded with the line\u2026 \u201cBecause I\u2019m tired and I think my Savior is ready to play.\u201d Meaning Jesus.

He had been begging his only child, my cousin, to visit him, but she had a hip replacement and wasn\u2019t able to travel. They lived 300 miles apart. His wife was very concerned, he was weak and in pain and just kept praying for enough time to see his daughter. As soon as the doctor gave her the OK to travel, her husband drove her to her father\u2019s bedside. They talked for hours. They had breakfast together in the morning. She says, she gave him permission to go on. He seemed to need that from her. Then she got in the car and headed home. Fifteen minutes later, he died. He had just been holding it off so he could see her. this can be one of many instances when We have seen someone who clearly knew she or he had been dying, and *needed* to perform one thing before they'd let go of. I'm convinced that folks can say for certain when they\u2019re gonna die. ",

I\u2019m aware every time I lose capacity, every time an activity becomes more difficult, there are many signs doctors can\u2019t read because they can\u2019t review 24hrs of every day, so they look for key events and compare them to create an average. I\u2019m not even near the average. I don\u2019t go to hospitals- I already have a nebulizer, the correct meds, 6l of oxygen available. The only thing they can do is put me on a ventilator which I refuse and this on my DNR order. When I lose the last of my ambulation capacity it\u2019s time to go.

I\u2019ve seen hospice nurses who talk to patients whose death is imminent and they appear to be in a coma-like state, because these nurses believe that, at some level, the dying patient may be able to hear, at least something, and hearing things like, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to let go\u2026\u201d or \u201cI/We love you and we always will), etc. Nathaniel thinking that to people dying and also to those comforting the patient, it is their individual beliefs whether the patient may be aware of their imminent passing.

I was gaping at a stranger who appeared to have my features, eyes open, face up, turning purple on the ground at my feet trying to figure out who they were, why they resembled me and why were the dead. Moreover, where did they come from? I was alone on an Alaskan island, what was this corpse doing under my feet. Before I could come to grips with this sudden horror I heard a great voice and turned to see it. Jesus was not so pleased with me and began to admonish me for things I'd said & done on this difficult planet. I went from disoriented to enraged and engage Jesus in a fight. Without a word, I was frozen in paralasys unable to move, except my eyes, I could blink. That was the beginning of a big 6\u20137 hours discussion with Jesus Christ, which ended with my bending knee, repentance and His forgiveness and my restoration. I am alive, made whole, demon-free and testify that which He has done for me to anyone who will listen. No, I died instantly, so quickly that I had no idea it had happened to me, it was so odd being alive in the spirit world, seeing other creations and sprit beings, demons and human creatures, that I thought at first that my mind had snapped.

If one is formally diagnosed with a terminal disease then one probably has a reasonable idea of \u201chow long they\u2019ve got\u201d, though diagnoses tend to be probabilistic and expressed in terms of how long people who have experienced the same disease survive over a given period of time. Then there\u2019s Quality-adjusted life year and stuff like that. It\u2019s a complicated and easily misunderstood area. In cases of sudden and unexpected death, it\u2019s very rarely expected, oddly enough. Some people do appear to have presentiments of death, though I\u2019ve never seen a rigorous study of the phenomenon (but by the same token, haven\u2019t really looked). Presumably William Pitt the younger who announced \"I think I could eat one of Bellamy's meat pies.\" and then dropped dead, didn\u2019t sense his imminent death, whereas Oscar Wilde might have done if he actually said \"this wallpaper will be the death of me - one of us will have to go\". Traditionally, one greets death with the phrase \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you so soon\u201d! ",

            "answer_text": "I have a few stories. One was my dad. Three were case studies of true cases. My dad was a devout Christian. He was undergoing cancer treatment when he kept announcing the King was waiting for him. And he started looking more cheerful. At that time he was not what we would call terminally ill. But he kept saying the king was on horse waiting for him. A few weeks later he died. He wasnt terminally ill. He just slipped away in hospital. The other cases were all the same. It was not an actual study on their death but more of chief complaint and why an ambulance was called. In all three cases, just prior to a cardiac arrest, otherwise healthy people suddenly stopped what they were doing and started screaming and beating people around them. This prompted people to call the police and ambulance cos they have suddenly gone crazy. But all three cases there were updates while ambulance was en route and in all three cases after the screaming and beating of people, they were unconscious. Ambulance arrived and conveyed as cases of cardiac arrest. I admit freaking out a bit reading of these cases. And if there were reports of someone screaming before fainting I usually mentally prepare for the worst. ",

I am not sure about being aware of one\u2019s impending demise by a few days but my experience would indicate that humans, like animals, know when they are about to die. Sometimes they will tell you they are going to die now and sometimes they know they will die in the next few hours. While working in Africa a patient\u2019s death was often heralded by the patient saying \u201cI want to say my prayers now\u201d. The first time I heard it I dismissed it as superstition, until a mature nurse explained it to me. The patient was right. Subsequently I took it very seriously and tried to prove them wrong. My own personal experience was similar and I had great difficulty persuading the physician whose patient I was that something was seriously amiss and needed immediate correction. ",

            "answer_text": "Studies have shown that many people know when they are dying. Sometimes long before a terminal diagnosis is made. It is sort of an internal clock that tells us when our bodies are failing. These people are more likely to make peace with themselves and others and put their affairs in order. They tend to accept death more easily. Other people stay in denial about their fate to the end. Studies show that these people have more pain, suffer more, and have less peaceful death. It is good to accept that death is a part of life, embrace rather than run from it as early as possible. Also people with some sort of spiritual belief have less problems with death. Cultivate an understanding of our finiteness and how that fits with your concept of spirituality early on, and death will not be so frightening. ",

If you\u2019re in a hospital and relatives you haven\u2019t seen for years are suddenly crowded around your bedside and crying, then that might be a bad sign for your longevity. Sometimes people just get a feeling. Sometimes you\u2019ve got your foot wedged into some train tracks at night, the train is bearing down at top speed, and that too is fairly predictable. But I wouldn\u2019t try to predict the end of your lifespan by natural causes if you are a young and healthy person (by which, in this case, I mean without any health conditions that might shorten your lifespan, like cancer or cystic fibrosis). Just live the best life you can, see a doctor for checkups regularly, do healthy things, eat and drink healthy things, and avoid things you know are unhealthy (cigarettes, for example). This will not 100% guarantee a long life, but it is generally the best that humans can do given current medical knowledge. At the very least, living a healthy lifestyle will make the years that you do live feel much better, and may even cause you to meet a partner for some of those years (say, if you work out at the same gym on the same days, or use the same track or road for jogging).

When it was her freind's turn for a reading the Tarot reader froze up. It was like she had literally seen a ghost. She flat out told the woman her death was imminent. Like knocking at her door. That she needed to \u201cget her affairs in order\u201d, etc. She started crying and ran out in a panic. Her freinds told her to blow it off. It was just entertainment. To take it with a grain of salt. But the woman was badly shaken and couldn't dismiss it. She even called off work for a couple days and stayed indoors. A few days later she worked up the courage to go see her sister in the next town over. On her way there she was involved in a serious car wreck and passed away in the hospital a few days later. As if death had stalked her the whole time. Some things defy any logic or explanation. ",

We are challenged in this world to fully inhabit the dream that is life. It is just a dream. Fill it with color and meaning, and then wake again to a new life. Live without fear, live merrily, for life is but a dream. Death is greatly misunderstood. It's as if we only can see a room lit with sunlight and we allow ourselves to believe that in darkness the room ceases to exist, or we cease to exist. Death is a simple state of transition, a change of state no more important than water turning to ice then to water again. We know from physics that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Your soul has always been here and will always exist. Your flesh is a temporary house, meant to please and amuse you, and as a vehicle for growth. It's your full life cycle; spirit to matter, to spirit again and again. ",

So they sent him the heart hospital and some of his stitches had come loose and the valve was leaking. They never intended to re operate but gave the impression and sent him home to get stronger for the operation. He gradually got worse and finally went to the hospital. I was in the room when the heart doctor came in. He told him to sit up so he could listen to him and when he did he told the doctor you better do something quick I am dying. His heart stopped and they brought him back but he was on life support for 5 days before passing away. ",

Or perhaps it\u2019s the comfort of having a loved one nearby that makes it easier to go. It\u2019s quite common (at least in my experience and my family\u2019s). On the other hand the presence of loved ones can sometimes hold a person back who is more than ready, but needs for their loved one(s) to actually leave before they pass away, as if that was what was holding them here beyond their time.
