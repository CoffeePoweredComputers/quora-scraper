            "answer_text": "The money supply is the total stock of notes, coins and bank deposits in the economy. If money is destroyed (taken out of circulation) and not put back in by the Central Bank, then the overall money supply in the economy will fall. There will be less money circulating. Prices will tend to fall, and the value of the remaining money increase. If the money supply falls, it is likely to cause deflation (falling prices) or at least reduce the inflation rate. In theory, reducing the money supply shouldn\u2019t have any effect on real incomes or real output. However, in a situation where the money supply is falling, it could cause a fall in aggregate demand and lower economic growth. If consumers notice a fall in the money supply (e.g. through lower nominal wages) they may lose confidence and because they fear lower incomes or unemployment start saving a higher percentage of their income. Even falling prices can have the effect of reducing spending: If prices are falling, consumers are more likely to delay purchasing them \u2013 until they are cheaper. This causes a lower aggregate demand.If prices and wages are falling, the real value of debt increases. It becomes harder to pay old debts back with falling wages, therefore this also causes lower economic growth.In recent years, deflation or very low inflation has created significant economic problems in both Japan and the Eurozone. It is all about maintaining the equilibrium as it it's true for all elements in the nature it is also true for the economical aspects of our life.

            "answer_text": "If a significant number of currency notes are destroyed then it means that too few money will chase too many Goods & Services in the market. The value of money will increase & inflation will nosedive. It may even go into negative territory i.e. deflation. Goods & Services become cheaper and their demand will be negligible. ",
