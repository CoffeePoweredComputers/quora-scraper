            "answer_text": "Depends on what you are playing or streaming. And are you already paying for a subscription service? If so, that\u2019s your answer, right? Anyway starting there - I assume the two most popular are Spotify and iTunes. I used Spotify for years and mostly loved it. I finally gave in and switched to Apple Music because of integration issues with my iOS devices. And actually I\u2019m a fan of the Apple Music app on my iPhone & iPad - but iTunes for Windows is a pain and slow. It\u2019s usable - just clunky - I can\u2019t help think it\u2019s at least partly due to the ongoing \u201capple vs. microsoft\u201d feud bullshit. To answer you question though - I\u2019ve used the following player for Windows for over 15 years. (since it was called media jukebox) JRiver Media Center I\u2019ve tried tons of them and this, for me, is hands down the best. At least it was - or is for now - but it\u2019s for large collections of LOCAL music files (mp3 or whatever format) - it\u2019s not for streaming. At least not with the big players - no spotify or apple music (iTunes). Which seems like a dead man walking\u2026 I still use it because I have a huge collection of mp3 files that i\u2019ve meticulously nurtured for decades and i\u2019m reluctant to abandoned it. (iTunes match at least let me sync/upload those files which worked okay. It doesn\u2019t organize things the way I like but it\u2019s alright. Spotify didn\u2019t offer anything like that.) Finally - JRMC does a lot more than I use it for - it\u2019s a full on media player - i just don\u2019t use it for anything but music. Oh and I recently got their app for iOS which allows me to stream my music library from my Windows desktop to my iOS devices which is awesome. Anyway - there are tons of decent players for Windows out there - the best one for you? Hard to say\u2026 This looks very interesting (but way spendy!)Roon Labs Community And here\u2019s a bunch of info:Comparison of audio player software - Wikipedia Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "As much as I HATE ITunes, it might be, to me the best music player for Windows. But not for the most obvious reasons. It can scan your whole computer and organize your music pretty Accurately. It'll place songs that either just have an artist name or title in the correct place and make things so much easier. Ive used Groove Music, but it's organization sucks! VLC Player had always been great. It's ability to play many different audio files no matter the distinction places it in the must have app slot, but to me the sound suffers a bit. Especially since it comes with its own volume control (which was set on max when I recently downloaded it and all I could here was distortion hell coming from my speakers.) Now, like I said iTunes has many flaws. Constant updates, a need to be signed in to access purchased music, internet access to get proper album covers. The list goes on. Don't even get me started on the sound quality! Once imported a project of mine that was all wav files and they sounded horrible the way iTunes read them. But the organization is superb. And if you're just looking to zone out to music as a background who cares for the sound quality that much? ",
