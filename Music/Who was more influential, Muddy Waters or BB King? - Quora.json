            "answer_text": "In general? Or for me? I\u2019ll go with for me since everyone gets their inspirations differently. I love both of them, they both have their own little something to give, but the most influential for me was muddy waters. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love BB\u2019s vibrato, and he has one hell of a singing voice. The man was truly larger then life. But, he was a little too polished for me. Everything seemed to be a little too perfect. That was the opposite of Muddy. Muddy was more raw. The deep delta blues feel was dripping all over his style, slightly sloppy, but just unmitigated. It was the war of polished Chicago blues and the delta blues, and that delta deepness just spoke me. His song writing felt more like he was doing it for him rather then everyone else. Nothing to prove kind of deal. That idea of music resonated with me throughout life. I am always drawn to the ones that don\u2019t seem to care what others think of them and just do what they do with no apologies. It\u2019s that kind of rawness that we have been missing over the last decade. Sure there are a few bands and people out there, but their changing of styles and seemingly spotlight grabbing has left me not feeling the same. Muddy was a pioneer, so was BB, but for me, Muddy was more the real deal. The ones that don\u2019t get massively huge are the ones I tend to generally go for, they are the ones thay generally inspire other to be more successful. Think the Pixies with Nirvana. The Pixies were a huge influence on Kurt, not many people were into the Pixies at the time, but we all know how Nirvana turned out. So, between the two, they are both blues masters that have their own to give to another willing to listen, Muddy just spoke louder to me. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "BB probably had more commercial success. He surely has influenced almost any musician, especially guitarists who desire to play the blues. Muddy may or may not have had the commercial success of BB(I really don\u2019t know), but as far as musicians aspiring to be blues players, I would rate them as equally influential. Listen to musicians such as, SRV, Joe Bonamassa, and many more. They also influenced each other as well as many of their peers. Listen to Buddy Guy and hear how they both influenced him. ",
