            "answer_text": "The YouTube-based music critic Anthony Fantano once did a video in which he discussed people\u2019s suggestions for the most annoying songs. He noticed that the suggestions usually had two things in common: they were 1) catchy and 2) void of any other merit. The point was that not all catchy songs necessarily become annoying, even if they are played a lot. Sometimes they have additional details in the music and lyrics that make repeated listens rewarding. Instead, songs tend to become annoying when they are catchy and become popular (and thus get played a lot) but don\u2019t reward these repeated listens and instead become tiresome, if not irritating. The Black-Eyed Peas weren\u2019t mentioned but I think that describes them rather well. At their best, they wrote catchy throwaway pop-rap songs that you put on for a party atmosphere. But the songs were never musically interesting, and the lyrics were lowest-common denominator when they weren\u2019t being outright dreadful (\u201cI met a girl down at the disco / She said hey hey hey ya let\u2019s go\u201d). Hate is too strong a word, but other than the times I had a fleeting interest in some of their hits, they were never my cup of tea. Another angle of criticism came from those who saw pop rap in general as a betrayal of what hip hop was supposed to be. They believed hip hop needed to be an edgy, anti-commercial genre. This has faded in the years since, as more pop music has been influenced by hip hop. ",

There even used to be, perhaps still is, a restaurant \u201cThe Black Eyed Pea\u201d and I love their entire menu. I\u2019ve never met anyone, not a single person, who hate Black-Eyed peas. Now you can say you know at least one person (me) who loves Black-Eyed Peas! ",
