            "answer_text": "Loudness and pitch are two different things. For a speaker, loudness correlates to how much the speakers moves. The more the speaker moves, the more intensely it creates increases and decreased in air pressure. Increases and decreases, at the frequencies speakers can create, is sound. The loudness is simply how much the speakers moves back and forth. So at a low volume, the speaker moves a certain amount. If you turn up the volume, then the speaker gets louder the more you turn it up, to the limit of the equipment. The frequency stays the same while the speaker gets louder because it is literally making the same wave shape, just at smaller and larger scales of power. Frequency is when that shape changes. So, a 1khz sine wave has a certain shape, and a 500hz sine wave shape has a longer wavelength. Both of these holding at their respective frequencies can be played through a speaker at various loudness levels. In fact, music is one complex waveform made up of all the various sounds, and speakers can reproduce that. Speakers are cool. ",
