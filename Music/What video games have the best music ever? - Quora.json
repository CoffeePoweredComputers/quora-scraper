            "answer_text": "Arc the Lad: End of DarknessMain Theme Let\u2019s start it off on a happy note. This song evokes images of a simpler time in gaming. A time before gritty reboots and deeply flawed protagonists, when the good guys were good and the bad guys needed to be stopped. It\u2019s unfortunate that music of this style helps establish a setting that would be considered almost childish by today\u2019s standards, but I just can\u2019t help but feel good when I hear the swell of those trumpets through the last half of the song.Composers : Koji Sakurai / Masahiro Andoh / Takayuki Hattori / Yuko Fukushima Suikoden Celtic Collection, Volume 2Time of Calmness This one may be a bit of a cheat on my part, as this version of the song never appeared in any of the Suikoden games. However, it is an official release as part of the brand, so I\u2019m going with it. I could have chosen any number of songs from the three celtic releases, but Time of Calmness is \u2013 hands down \u2013 my favorite. The first half is a mellow burn, reminiscent of the first game in the series when your hero returns to his wartorn home city where the once joyous theme is now just a haunting echo. But when the song opens up midway, it does so with gusto.Composer : Miki HigashinoArrangers : Yoko Ueno / Yuji Yoshino / Yuko Asai / Shigeyoshi Kawagoe. Command and Conquer: Red AlertHell March Red Alert was a silly, silly thing. It was a real time strategy game set in WW2, with time travel and giant Tesla coils capable of destroying armies. And by silly I mean awesome, of course. While this is not the best song on the list, and the only metal one, it wins a spot by being perfect for the game it was in. The song is dirty, mean, and I always feel like I should get a tetanus shot after hearing it. My only complaint is the superfluous dance remix sounding thing at the end \u2013 but honestly, I don\u2019t remember ever hearing that in the game, so maybe it was added for the soundtrack release. I could be wrong!Composer : Frank Klepacki HaloMain theme When you\u2019re developing a game to be the flagship of an entire console, it\u2019s probably best not to neglect any aspect of it. As a result, the Halo theme is an incredibly polished and professional piece of music. This is the version from the first game in the series. Later versions added wailing guitars and piano parts, and they sound pretty good\u2026 But I believe this to be the purest version. To everyone\u2019s surprise they decided on a new theme for the fourth Halo game \u2013 but it just doesn\u2019t have the same majesty as the original and its various reincarnations over the years.Composers : Martin O\u2019Donnell / Michael Salvatori Pirates of the Burning SeaTides of Fire Who doesn\u2019t love swashbuckling to pirate songs? Pirates was a mediocre game; still, my friends and I had some fun with it for a while, and the soundtrack still gets play in our game room now and again. Sadly, most of the songs are disappointingly short.Composers : Adam Gubman / Adrian Decker NierHills of Radiant Winds I\u2019ll admit I never played Nier, but the music is too good to exclude it from the list. The music was composed specifically for the game, but without any relation to what the game is about. In fact, elements of the game were later altered to better fit the music provided. Seems like an odd way of going about it to me, but the end result is wonderful. There is a general theme of melancholy that seeps into every song on the OST. Even those tunes which seem to have everything necessary to be upbeat, somehow end up sadder.Composers : Keiichi Okabe / Kakeru Ishihama / Keigo Hoashi / Takafumi Nishimura Beyond Good and EvilHome Sweet Home Some songs are just plain beautiful. Beyond Good and Evil was a great game, which for various reasons failed upon release. With a strong female protagonist (IE fully dressed) named Jade, your task was to stop the destruction of your world from an alien invasion, while armed with little more than a stick, a camera, and your journalistic integrity.Home Sweet Home was the piece played over the end credits, while the camera panned slowly through her lighthouse/war orphanage home, over children\u2019s drawings and photos of well-earned happier times. Very moving.Composer : Christophe Heral JourneyNascense The 1981 release of the album \u201cEscape\u201d marked the height of Journey\u2019s popularity. With hit songs like \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d and\u2026 wait, that\u2019s the wrong Journey.Journey \u2013 the game \u2013 was released in early 2012, and it is one of the best ever arguments for video games as works of art. The soundtrack is no exception: the idea was to \u201ccreate music that would be dynamically changing while still containing a composed emotional arc.\u201c No easy feat, it turns out. Music development took three years \u2013 the entire development cycle of the game. Three years may seem like a lot of work for a game that can be played through in an afternoon, but the experience is something I would recommend to anyone.Composer : Austin Wintory World of WarcraftSeasons of War Quitting Warcraft is a bit like trying to leave the mafia. Even now there are forces trying to drag me back to it, despite my protests. I think they might be getting the wrong idea from the fact that I still listen to songs from the original soundtrack so often, but come on\u2026 This song has all the hallmarks of a winner. It has so much power \u2013 as is appropriate for a game with \u2018War\u2019 in its very name \u2013 and that final series of sorrowful notes sends a chill up my spine every time.Composer : Jason Hayes Shadow HeartsThe Fate I\u2019m a sucker for a sad violin. Almost as much as I am for an angry fiddle. I can\u2019t recall ever hearing them in the same song before, but it perfectly frames the emotions as the music flows from sadness into anger, and then moves into what could only be described as vengeance. Toss in a mellow acoustic guitar and some powerful female vocals, and it makes for a very solid work.Composers : Yoshitaka Hirota / Yasunori Mitsuda Mass Effect 2Suicide Mission One of the first bits of advice I ever received about writing a story was that your protagonist will often need to be beaten down. Once he or she has nothing left to lose, then the stage is set for a truly meaningful comeback. In this case, the song itself is that comeback. This song represents the act of rising up out of the blood and ashes, to do what needs to be done. It\u2019s unstoppable, growing ever more and more insistent \u2013 even when it seems impossible that it could possibly continue to do so.Composer \u2013 Jack Wall BeatmaniaAvant-Guerre The Beatmania series is complicated. The gamers are tasked with playing the music provided, using a 7-button analogue keyboard. The higher the difficulty selected, the more difficult the music piece becomes. That is where Osamu Kubota comes in. Over the years he has provided a wealth of amazing short piano works to the series to really challenge the hardcore players. Fans of the series work very hard on being able to master songs like this one, practicing for hours at home so they\u2019ll put on a good show at the arcade.Composer : Osamu Kubota Valkyria ChroniclesOpening Cinematic For a turn-based strategy game fought with tanks and guns, Valkyria Chronicles had an art style and plot-line that were surprisingly beautiful. The whole game is presented with visuals that feel like a sketchbook, despite being 3D rendered. The love story is very well written, and avoids most of the tropes in Japanese storytelling, which don\u2019t translate very well to a western audience. I\u2019ll admit I might be a little biased in putting this song so high on the list, but it\u2019s a lovely piece either way.Alternately, I would have loved to add Rosie\u2019s theme, as sung by Hedy Burress in the English version, but the entire scene is a massive spoiler.Composer : Hitoshi Sakimoto BastionBuild That Wall (Zia\u2019s Theme) I could have included the entire soundtrack, really, but I had to pick one song. Bastion is an indy game released in mid-2011 to rave reviews. The game-play is enjoyable enough, but it was the music and narration that really sold it. I\u2019m not even sure how to describe the soundtrack. It has a southern blues twang, a massive string section, as well as heavily sampled beats which I\u2019m normally not a fan of. It all comes together perfectly in the end.Zia\u2019s Theme isn\u2019t a very good representation of the soundtrack as a whole, but it is the most iconic and poignant song from the game. It appears at first to simply be a melancholy little ditty from a lonely survivor. As you play on, it becomes clearer that it is actually a call to war between the underground people and the wall-building ones above ground. Such a pretty song, yet with such a brutal implications\u2026Composer : Darren Korb SkyrimDragonborn In many ways, the Skyrim theme is a bit derivative of number seven on this list, and maybe even inspired by it. Still, everything about this song is massive. An aggressive male chorus, a booming orchestra, and chilling, distant female vocals punctuating the pauses\u2026 Every time I hear it I just want to go out and punch a dragon in the face. I really have to give them credit, too, for writing the entire song in the fictional language of dragons created for the game.The song has spawned countless covers by fans and professionals alike. From heavy metal to acapella, and just about everything in between \u2013 including a couple of surprisingly good rap versions. When so many different people agree that a piece of music is amazing, where else could it belong but at number 1 on this list?Composer : Jeremy Soule ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people have mentioned the work of Jack Wall, Chris Velasco, Chris Lennertz and Clint Mansell on the Mass Effect trilogy, so I won't mention it again. However I haven't seen much mention of composers like Kelly Bailey who scored much of the the Half Life 2 and its episodes, which is regarded as benchmark for games, even almost 15 years after its Half Life 2\u2032s release. A few tracks stick out in particular from Half Life 2\u2019s score, one of those being Triage at Dawn, as I think it accurately captures the despair of what it would be like living under the boot heel of the Combine occupation on the planet during that time. The chilling tone seems to drive home that people are no longer free, and that they are being forced into a gentle genocide by the Combine.  Another is far more upbeat, Something Secretly Steers Us, which serves to really motivate the player when they reach the end of Highway 17 and have end up running afoul of two dozen or so Combine soldiers, and their gunship air support. I really gets sets the tone for what can be a frenzied race between the top of the lighthouse and the ammo crate containing the rockets, all while blasting combine bullet sponge soldiers directly into the afterlife.  I've not seen mention of the likes of Israeli composer Inon Zur, who scored critically acclaimed hits like Dragon Age, the first Crysis. I will be focusing on the former for this answer, as it is a truly marvelous collection of music. The opening theme is somewhat haunting, combining brass, string and percussion to create a score which is both heroic in some aspects, and demonic in others. Rather fitting for the game, in my opinion.  Now, I mentioned Crysis, and while Crysis did indeed have a great score, I found it to be easily the weakest between the four games. So I will mention the seemingly awe inspiring result that was the work of none other than frequent collaborator of renowned film director, Christopher Nolan, Hans Zimmer. To say that the work that Hans Zimmer put into Crysis 2 makes the game so good is quite frankly an understatement. While Zimmer did not score the entire game, the tracks he did score have become instantly identifiable.  This track sends many a shiver down my spine, and mated with the trailer of Alcatraz decimating an entire task force of CELL PMC troops with all of their equipment really does hint at how much of force to be reckoned with a skilled soldier in a Nanosuit is.  Prophet\u2019s Journey, also composed by Zimmer captures that while the battle has been won, the war for humanities continued existence has only just begun. The Zimmer\u2019s expert use of string, percussion and wind instruments is well known in his cinematic scores, however this gives the player a truer sense of accomplishment, and this is an easter egg presented upon completion of the single player campaign. Now, I\u2019ve mentioned a lot of older games, and while I said I wasn\u2019t going to go on about Mass Effect, I meant only the original trilogy. Mass Effect Andromeda, while the games quality in terms of story and animation was shall we say questionable, I think a few parts of the score were something special. Composed by John Paesano, this is about the Mass Effect-y as this game got. But John\u2019s score really saved Andromeda from being a complete disappointment.  Okay, I\u2019m almost done, I mean it, just one more. Joel Nielsen. The name doesn\u2019t ring many bells for a large number of people, however he used scored Black Mesa, a long (I mean long, like really long, think like over a decade long) awaited fan made remake of the original Half Life. I know you must be groaning, but just listen to it, you will not be disappointed.   Transcendant, as its titled plays as the player wakes up after being teleported to Xen. Upon arrival, they are greeted by a breathtaking vista that truly in all its glory is alien. Thanks for reading, and listening. ",
