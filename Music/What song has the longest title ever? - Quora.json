            "answer_text": "Looks like Jamie Winterhalt gave a good answer to this question. I wouldn\u2019t have known what the longest published song title is. However the longest one among my favorite songs is probably this one: I Don't Want Nobody To Give Me Nothing (Open Up The Door I'll Get It Myself), Pt. 1 by James Brown  One difference between this song title and the ones on Jamie Winterhalt\u2019s list is that it was not made to purposely be long and absurd. It is a real, serious title. Some people take this song as being some kind of anti-welfare diatribe showing that James Brown was right wing, but I don\u2019t think that was the case. The key is in the line \u201cOpen up the door.\u201d It\u2019s hard to \u201cget it yourself\u201d when when the door is closed and locked. Perhaps the second longest song title among my favorites is: It\u2019s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll) by AC/DC  EDIT April 23, 2019: Actually a slightly longer one is: When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You  ",

            "answer_text": "My favourite \u201clong title\u201d song is \u201cSeveral Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict\u201d by Pink Floyd (one of their stranger early numbers). But this is only the 26th longest published song title, according to 100 longest song titles. Apparently, the longest title is \u201cRegretting What I Said to You When You Called Me 11:00 On a Friday Morning to Tell Me that at 1:00 Friday Afternoon You\u2019re Gonna Leave Your Office, Go Downstairs, Hail a Cab to Go Out to the Airport to Catch a Plane to Go Skiing in the Alps for Two Weeks, Not that I Wanted to Go With You, I Wasn\u2019t Able to Leave Town, I\u2019m Not a Very Good Skier, I Couldn\u2019t Expect You to Pay My Way, But After Going Out With You for Three Years I Don\u2019t Like Surprises\u201d by Christine Lavin, which almost takes longer to read than to listen to!
