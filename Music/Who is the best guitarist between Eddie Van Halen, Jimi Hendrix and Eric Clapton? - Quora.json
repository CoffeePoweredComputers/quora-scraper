            "answer_text": "\u201cMy chops are not as fast... [but] I just learned more on what was in my mind than what was in my chops. I learned a long time ago that one note can go a long way if it's the right one, and it will probably whip the guy with twenty notes.\u201d \u2013 Les Paul \u201cDifferences of opinion... [are] part of collaborating with another human being. But music is not a competitive thing. I don't want to deal with someone who's in competition with me, I want to work together and make music.\u201d \u2013 Edward Van Halen \u201cI like to play with people who can play simple and are not threatened by other musicians thinking they can't play. And that eliminates 99 percent of the musicians.\u201d --Neil Young There\u2019s something in me that resists the whole competitive thing, who\u2019s better, who\u2019s faster, who\u2019s on top. (Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m surrounded by amazing musicians in my hometown(?)) A lot of it comes down to taste, and more importantly, to what really resonates with you, as a listener, and as a musician. What kind of a guitarist was B.B. King? Not flashy, certainly. Not fast, not a rule-breaker. But he could say more with one note than Yngwie Malmsteen could say with a hundred (and no, I\u2019m not putting down Yngwie Malmsteen! I\u2019m simply pointing out that virtuosity isn\u2019t everything). B.B. King lived the blues, and that experience informed every note he played. Similarly, David Gilmour isn\u2019t a flashy player either, but he knows how to communicate, through his playing, which is something I really respect. In short, it\u2019s not how you play, but what you\u2019re saying with what you play. If you\u2019re shredding up a storm but not saying anything of consequence, people may think, \u201cwow, that was flashy!\u201d but an hour later they probably won\u2019t remember a damn note. I respect Clapton a lot. I respect Eddie a lot (RIP!)\u2026 But, I will end with this: of all the guitarists that were hot tickets when I was a kid growing up (Clapton, Townshend, Mayall, Page, Zappa, and many others (all of whom I love, BTW)) it was Hendrix that inspired me to pick up a guitar, and learn to play it.

            "answer_text": "First of all, Eric Clapton is not even remotely part of the argument. Jimi Hendrix (as a lefty) had to re-string a guitar and teach himself how to play it because there were no left-handed guitars at that time. Eddie (God Bless his Soul) was an AMAZING guitarist. Long ago, I thought he was the greatest, BUT I watched a video with David Lee Roth that completely changed my mind. While he was in no way trying to criticize Eddie\u2019s talents, he brought to light the fact that when Van Halen was on the rise, they began using equipment that would allow them to take an enormous amount of \u201ctracks.\u201d So, they could record the song as a band on 8 tracks, then let Eddie record solos on the remaining 24 tracks, and then splice them together to make unheard-of guitar solos that could never be duplicated. Then, Eddie went home and tried to figure out how he could splice it all together for the live performances. I love Eddie. But he doesn\u2019t hold a candle to Hendrix. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t find the video to link it to due to the overwhelming videos being posted in the last few days, but it is out there on youtube. RIP Eddie. ",
