            "answer_text": "There\u2019s music that is relatable to your life (such as current events/personality trait/opinions on something) and another type is the one that you can\u2019t really blend into, but you just love it. For the relatable pieces, it feels like opening doors that reveal an abandoned place that you didn\u2019t know existed in your soul. You\u2019ve forgotten your capability to hold that much \u201cweight\u201d deep inside, but now it\u2019s all coming back, sometimes so suddenly it hits you hard like an explosion(Goosebumps, eh?). In a way, I guess you could say at the end of hearing anything of this kind of music, I feel like they help you develop a \u201cnew you\u201d by opening your eyes to the \u201cold you\u201d. For pieces that are \u201cirrelevant\u201d, they can still be a favourite because I see it this way, the music is some sort of an invitation card. An invite into a world where you can put yourself in other\u2019s shoes and view reality from their perspective, in their fantasy. This kind of music teaches me to be understanding and prioritise empathy, knowing that the world is a strange place and we\u2019ve all got eyes and ears but to each of us, it\u2019s a lot of different sights and sounds. About instrumental songs, now these ones are a truly amazing. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re better than those with lyrics, but this type is a rather mysterious one that really displays and embraces the power of the sound itself. It\u2019s similar to those cartoons with barely to zero amount of dialogue but they\u2019re still funny and intense and immersive. They just make you feel. You don\u2019t know exactly why. How does a combination of several levels of pitch and volumes bring you somewhere else? I like to think that music was not created for people to wreck their brains and try to explain how it works in our minds. Believe it or not, this unknown plays a big role in making music as thrilling as it is relaxing. It was just for us to enjoy. Willingly accept it and love it. ",

            "answer_text": "Music is a way for me to release inner emotions that are weighing me down at that moment. If I\u2019m angry I\u2019ll listen to rock music and afterwards it\u2019s like my anger came out thru that song and then I feel calm. If I\u2019m sad about something or feeling hopeless I listen to my \u201chappy music\u201d and it makes me feel optimistic again. \u201cSunshine\u201d by Jonathan Edwards is my go-to in those moments. Thank you for asking me! ",
