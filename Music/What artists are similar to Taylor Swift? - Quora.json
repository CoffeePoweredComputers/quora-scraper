            "answer_text": "That is an interesting question. Taylor Swift started making low key country music and grew into a famous country artist. If you want to know what music is like her original music, we could probably say Carrie Underwood or Tim McGraw are similar artists to Taylor Swifts original music. Later in her musical carrier she integrated into the pop scene with catchy songs. In those days, artists like Adele, or Katy Perry are somewhat similar. She then found herself in the Pop scene, making electronic and pop music. Most famous artists these days make this kind of music like Ariana Grande, or even some Shawn Mendes songs could relate to hers. No one really has the same music, and it really depends on your style of music to find out what fits you the most. Taylor Swift has a bunch of songs with a wide array of Generes. Shes done her mix in mashups and collaborations with artists. I would personally look into the artists shes done collaborations with, you are bound to get some good results. ",
