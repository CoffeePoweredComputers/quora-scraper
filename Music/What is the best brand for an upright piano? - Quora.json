            "answer_text": "Either Kawaii or Yamaha are good brands for upright pianos. I have tried both, and the Kawaii pianos sound a bit more mellow; whereas, the Yamaha pianos have a brighter sound. I have not tried a Steinway upright piano before, but I would imagine that a Steinnway upright would be of exceptional quality. Steinway has a reputation for making the most beautiful grand pianos, which professionals all over the world perform on. The only thing is that they are quite expensive. If you want to by an upright piano to practice your pieces on at home, a Kawaii or Yamaha upright would be great brands to look into. You can save your money and put it towards your savings to buy a baby grand piano once you get really serious :) ",
