HAVE THEY EVEN HEARD OF SOMETHING KINDA CRAZY?OR CANDY? Blue lemonade, Mr. E, Little little, butterflies, Rookie, Kingdom Come, Be natural, Automatic, ice cream Cake, Dumb Dumb, Oh boy, Wish tree, Rebirth, One of these nights, Lady's room, happiness, Happily ever after, Peekaboo, Perfect 10, Moonlight Melody, My second date, Look, All right, Hit that drum, power up, really bad boy, bad boy, Mosquito, Zoo, Hear the sea, Red flavor, You better know, I just, or even Russian Roullette, or Lucky girl or Bad dracula and more songs I can't think off of the top of my head, THESE ARE ALL BOPS. If you say otherwise then we can't be friends. Nah I'm kidding. I have listened to a lot of kpop group discography and I can confidently say Red Velvet has the best discography in my opinion. I am sorry for you didn't get the answer you're looking for because it is impossible to say Red Velvet's discography is bad. Their producers and composers have won grammy awards and Red Velvet's concept is so diverse that you wouldn't ever get sick or tired of their music. ",

I don't understand why you think it is bad, because they're all unique and really catchy. Some of the best: -You better know, Zoo -Time Slip, Campfire, Lady\u2019s Room ect. -Let\u2019s be honest The perfect red velvet repackage is their best album so far. Each song is worth the listen and I've never regretted getting the whole album. There is more, so give them all a listen! It just might not be your style, and that\u2019s ok. I respect that. Have a good day! ",
