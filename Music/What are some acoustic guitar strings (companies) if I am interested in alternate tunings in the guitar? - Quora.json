            "answer_text": "I have a 1998 Langejans WGC6 handbuilt guitar which is played in standard as well as multiple alternate tunings. I have used GHS, Elixirs, D'Addarios, coated & uncoated strings very successfully. Since I play on a worship team I am always based around A440 cycle tuning. EADGBE. So, I tend to use 11\u201353 or 12\u201354 gaged strings which are considered lights or medium lights. If however, you plan to tune down a full step / 2 half tones, DGCFAD or even lower like a C tuning, you may want to upsize your string gage to a heavier gage. Guutarists like Phil Keaggy, the Avett Bros or Leo Kotke often tune down a full step to make it easier to sing for 2 hour concerts and / or to make their instrumentals sound much fuller. They tend to use heavier gage strings which keeps the string tension on the neck/bridge similar to standard tuning tension. It also lets the do bends etc comfortably. One point to keep in mind. If you plan to drop your tuning down such as above, be sure to take your guitar to a reputable luthier for a proper set up. Changing gages or using lower tunings will require a professional neck & truss rod adjustment which is best left to an expert. Also, the nut slots may need to be made wider and the bridge saddle may require attention. By all means, call or email your particular guitar's manufacturer for advice. Different tonewood combinations also may affect what strings sound/work best as well. In my case, I always gravitate back to D'Addario's for my Langejans. Del Langejans, who built my guitar told me that over his career he evolved to \u201cvoice\u201d his guitars specifically for DA strings. This was a result of his design philosophy of how he made, shaped and placed the bracing inside his guitars. The resulting tone is his artistic license or signature that makes his guitars so desirable and sets them apart. If you have a Taylor, Gibson, Ovation, Guild, Fender or a Dean, you'll find the manufacturer has done the same thing. Bottom line, any string manufacturer will be fine although all strings are not equal quality-wise. Don't be afraid to spend a little extra on high quality strings. You may find the cost is offset by longer life, less breakage and fewer string changes. Coated & Cryogenic treated strings last much longer with little change in string tone. Plan on having to experiment a bit to find the tone, gages and features that work best for you. Above all, have fun. Playing guitar is so rewarding in many many ways. ENJOY! ",
