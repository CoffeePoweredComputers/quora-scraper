            "answer_text": "Elvis famously picked up a guitar as an 11-year-old in Tupelo, when his mother, Gladys, purchased a guitar for him for his birthday from Tupelo Hardware. Elvis Presley, American Roll & Roll icon, began playing guitar at a young age. It is said that he was taught by Brother Frank Smith, a young black minister at the First Assembly of God Church in Tupelo, though Brother Frank notes that Elvis already had a guitar method book when he first came in contact with him. It is also said that Brother Frank taught Elvis the A,D and E chords which were needed to play \u201cOld Shep\u201d, a tune that a very young Elvis learned and eventually sang at his first public performance, a Mississippi State Fair talent show. Elvis had relatives who played and undoubtedly he was shown things about playing by them. ",
