            "answer_text": "TLDR the Korean market is more sophisticated and values talent/skill over mass appeal. Tbh, not super qualified to answer this. I\u2019ve never been to Korea nor do I understand k-pop outside the context of international appeal. But his question has been sitting here and I\u2019m a fan of IU. The thing that stands out to me about IU is she\u2019s the best selling artist in Korea and continues to top various categories in melon. However, she\u2019s almost unknown in the US. Some argue it\u2019s because lyricism is a primary factor in her Korean popularity and thus the true beauty of her songs can only be understood by one who knows Korean, but I think there\u2019s more to it. I wouldn\u2019t say IU is influential (though I\u2019m sure she is) but rather indicative of the difference between the Korean music market and the international market. IMO, the artists that do well in Korea are incredibly talented musically. Their song structure is significantly more complicated, the messaging is deeper, and production cleaner and more exact. Take palette\u2026 it\u2019s in the key of C which seems simple enough, but the song actually starts on the IV in the key of F. Lydian mode? The tempo is around 100 which neither fits into trap/hip hop or EDM tempo ranges. The lyrics are about fighting others expectations and aging. It\u2019s like growing up but a little more subtle. The best parts are how her melody interacts with the keyboard licks. On the other hand you got k-pop like Blackpink which is just trap+EDM about superficial romance (not that the songs aren\u2019t catchy!). IU is also a solo act in a sub-industry of groups. There are no foreigners brought in to appeal to international markets, she doesn\u2019t have to sing in multiple languages, and holds her own throughout the whole song. If BTS and Blackpink are popular in international markets b/c they represent assimilation and globalism, IU represents a Korean nationalism. IU is a feeing of cultural superiority from a older aristocratic standard of art- that music is good when it displays talent and challenges our conception of good music; as opposed to a democratic standard that values the number of streams above all else\u2026 ",
