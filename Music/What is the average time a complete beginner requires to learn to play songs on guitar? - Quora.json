            "answer_text": "The time required to learn a song depends upon a number of factors. First, how long have you been playing? This in itself is the underlying gauge to how long you will take to learn a given song - assuming it isn\u2019t Eric Johnson ability level required. Second, how well developed is your ear - essential to hearing things correctly if you are learning \u201cby ear\u201d without a chart. Or, you\u2019re dealing with charts. But you still need a reference - the recording - to gauge other elements like the rhythm, feel, timing, et cetera. So, still some degree of ear training is required. Third, knowledge of what is required to actually play the song involved. This will include the above ear-training, good rhythm skills, time keeping skills (because if you play with other people, they expect you to know how to keep good time). But we are more emphasizing technique, chord knowledge and scale knowledge. So, given all the above factors, how long does it take to learn a given song? Okay, the timeframes I am mentioning refer to knowing the song and sounding good, not exactly how quickly you get the idea. Most songs you\u2019ll get the idea within an hour or so, depending on the above factors. If you have been playing less than a year, you should be able to play songs like Have You Ever Seen The Rain by Credence Clearwater Revival, Yellow Submarine by the Beatles, and similar tunes within a week and sound pretty good. If you have been playing for up to two years, you should be able to tackle songs like Love Potion #9 by the Searchers - including the solo (very easy), That\u2019ll Be The Day by Buddy Holley, including solo, and similar songs in about a week. Other songs like Banana Pancakes by Jack Johnson can be in this group. If you have been playing for two to four years, some Led Zeppelin tunes should be pretty easy by now, Whole Lotta Love, Immigrant Song, The Ocean, even Heartbreaker in something around a week or two. The harder the song, the more time you need to allow. Include some Deep Purple stuff, Iron Maiden and other similar bands. The solos will take longer on some songs, depending upon how difficult they are. Songs like Blackbird by the Beatles should be easily apprehended within a couple weeks. Beyond four years, you should be able to tackle more complex songs. But again, you have to allow for time and possibly learning new techniques or different applications of known techniques as part of the process. This is just a general guideline, by no means comprehensive, and it is also dependent upon how much you practice, whether you are learning on your own or taking lessons, and other factors that will affect your progress and ability to learn songs well enough to have them sound good when you play them. You have to know your ability, knowledge and willingness to dedicate yourself to learning the song well. This will dictate everything, show you what you need to learn in order to play a given song that is \u201cjust out of reach\u201d, or whatever you may lack that prevents you from playing a given song. On average, though, assuming knowledge and ability for a given song, you should be able to get the basics within a few hours, and then solidify them within a week. Solos can take a few days to a couple weeks or more, depending on how complicated they are, to come into sounding really coherent and sit right when playing them in the context of the song.

            "answer_text": "To me your question raises several issues: average time, complete beginner, learn guitar, practise guitar, play guitar, choose songs, learn songs, play songs, songs, without a teacher, with a teacher and so on. I can't address these all in one answer but I would alert you to four stages of attaining your goal. And some helpful resources. Stage 1: Choose the song. How long is it? How fast is it? How tricky is it? How does it make me feel. How much do I really like it? Do I like the song or domes somebody else that i like really likes the song? etc. This is a whole topic in itself. Stage 2: Learn the song with 32 learning steps and 23 recalling steps per chunk (How to learn the melody, learn the lyric, learn the chords, learn the bass line separately in small chunks to learning tempo---say MM40 in your metronome) Stage 3:  Train the body to perfectly play the song gradually from learning tempo to performance tempo; say from MM40 to MM120.  This is an 80 beat per minute gap to bridge so conservatively, allow 1 day per incremental beat so allow 80 days to train your body to play the song perfectly at MM120 and at every metronome mark in between.  Stage 4: Perform the song. To at least one other person. == Like you, parents of my children guitar students want to know the average time their child will take tolearn and play a song. For them I produced a video called How Long For My Child To LEARN A Guitar Song that you can find here:    I also showed them in detail the 32 learning steps for any chunk of music on guitar in a video called Vertical Guitar Lesson Study for your Child available here:    The video that might interest you the most is the one entitled How Long For My Child To PLAY A Guitar Song available here:    While these videos are framed for child beginners and their parents, they are musically and guitaristically relevant and valuable to any adult guitar beginner. == What might interest you most is the Song Training Calculator spreadsheet that you can download at the bottom of the last linked page. You can enter in the basic parameters for your song: the start tempo, the goal tempo and you target weekly tempo increase as well as the number of days per week and minutes per day you will set aside for guitar song training. For example, if you want to move a song from MM40 to MM120 with a weekly MM increase of 6 beats per minute, then it will take you 13 weeks to get there. If you set aside 6 minutes a day, 6 days a week, you will have played 49,968 bars or 199,872 beats over that period.  If your song was 96 bars long you will have repeated the song 520 times. Because most plans start with optimistic assumptions there is also a scenario variance setting which allows you to enter either a best scenario or worst scenario (or any scenario value). For example if you set a variance of 90% then it would take 15 weeks to reach your goal. If you set it to 110% you'd get there in 12 weeks. This Song Training Calculator will help you to answer your own question about average times for learning and playing songs on guitar?  Hope this helps. ",
