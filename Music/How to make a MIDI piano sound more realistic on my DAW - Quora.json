            "answer_text": "Use a MIDI keyboard with preferably semi-weighted to weighted keys. Use it to enhance feel and for its natural dynamics How you play the keyboard is up to youAvoid quantizing, or if you have to, use very little of it.Naturally, Humans make mistakes. Quantizing is more \"robot-like\" in that it perfects mistakes. To make it sound natural or human, just play the notes you want the best way you can... You're human after all, so even if you are talented, your timing will be slightly off on parts, and that's ok!Use a high quality sound libraryThe higher the quality of the sound library, the greater it sounds, and the less tedious mixing you have to do. You know it's a great sounding library if it sounds high-quality, and if it requires a minor basic mix to absolutely no mix at all. A high-quality sound library will also be sensitive to how you play the MIDI keyboard.Suggestion: Native Instrument's Kontakt Player and their various pianos. If you don't have the luxury of a MIDI keyboard, mess with the note velocity and note placing/timing. It's time-consuming and requires patience as you will be doing a lot of trial and error ",

            "answer_text": "I will give a tip that i use in ableton, mostly i use this technique in genres where it has to be pretty snappy to the grid, EDM and Pop-esque music. Also always use this one when im on the go and cant use a keyboard to play notes in. Ableton has a midi effect called Velocity, where you can set lowest and highest value, aswell as introduce randomization. This i dial to taste, and you already hear difference, as no note will ve played the same. To ramp realism up more, i then set straight groove to the midi clip, go to global groove settings (down left above info bar, two ~ stacked icon) and there are quantization and randomization. Depending on the tempo ill set quantization either to 1/8 or 1/16 and dial in randomization to taste. Now the clip has turned into robotic performance, that will never repeat exactly the same. Subletly, this brings up dynamics and human flavour to music. You can then either record part to a new midi clip, or keep it as it is. See if your daw has similar options. ",
