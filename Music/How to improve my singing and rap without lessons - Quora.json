            "answer_text": "Well, I assume you are talking about pop singing and not opera (rap goes with pop but certainly not with opera). Although the study of the light vocalism of pop is much less demanding in difficulty and duration of lyrical singing, it is still something that must be studied, son. So I also recommend to you what I usually say to those who ask me about opera singing: in singing and in music in general there is no self-study, I'm sorry. I don't know anything about Rap. Maybe in that case, since objectively the music is absent there, you can learn something by listening to those who do it but if it is singing in a broad sense I confirm what I told you. ",

Sing your own music only.And don\u2019t do rap. Rapping is not singing. Rap is talk. You need to sing, not talk. ",
