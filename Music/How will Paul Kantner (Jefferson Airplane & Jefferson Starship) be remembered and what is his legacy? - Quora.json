            "answer_text": "For a brief moment in history, May, 1969, there was no bigger band on the planet than Jefferson Airplane with Balin, Slick, Kantner, Kaukonen, Dryden, and Casaday. That was the year when music collided with LSD and nobody was better at negotiating that in music than Jefferson Airplane with Grace Slick's great vocals. Kantner was important as founder and key member of the group, which went into the Hall of Fame alongside Pink Floyd in 1996. If there is a sound track of the 60's, Kantner and Jefferson Airplane are a significant though short chapter in it.  Interestingly, Kantner and the Starship were scheduled to appear in the Medina Ballroom, about three miles from my home, tonight. Although my friend who works there tells me that he was probably too ill to performt, they did feature him in their ads (BLUE OYSTER CULT & JEFFERSON STARSHIP (THEY WILL STILL BE PLAYING TONIGHT) - Tickets - Medina Entertainment Center - Medina, MN - January 29th, 2016).  There is a growing sentiment that there might be a Medina Curse. Just last month, Scott Weiland of the Stone Temple Pilots died days just before his Medina appearance and the October performance of Three Dog Night was cancelled when lead singer Cory Wells died unexpectedly causing them to cancel their Medina date.  It's time for the Medina to bring back Ted Nugent. ",
