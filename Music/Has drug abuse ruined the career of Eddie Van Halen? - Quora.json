            "answer_text": "I think his own ego & poor decisions made with his brother regarding their band ruined not only Eddie Van Halen\u2019s career but also sullied the band name as well. I don\u2019t know if substance abuse has much to do with it. When you treat your band mates poorly it will eventually catch up with you & bite you in the butt. Incidentally, Sammy Hagar & Michael Anthony are more active musically & more visible than Van Halen nowadays. Kind of ironic considering Sammy Hagar had a good solo career, but nothing as huge as Van Halen before he joined them. Now Sammy Hagar\u2019s side projects & albums with his bands The Waboritas, The Circle, & Chickenfoot keep him & Michael Anthony busy while Van Halen can\u2019t even get started again. When Van Halen does get together & play they sound horrible. ",
