            "answer_text": "These are the movies,posters and scenes, that are copied from Hollywood movies. Thupakki: \"Thuppakki (2012) dialogue inspiration from Taken (2008)\" Endhiran: 2. South India's one of the biggest blockbuster \" Endhiran/Robo (2010)\" plot inspired from Hollywood's John Malkovich starring \" Making Mr. Right (1987)\". Also it took inspiration from I Robot plot too . Endhiran poster looks similar to Terminator series posters & also its robotic design may get inspired from I Robot .  It has also been noted that there is well praised scene in Endhiran where Chitti Robo finds the black sleep.We can see the similar scene in I Robot as well where Will Smith finds the wrong one from a group of robots.May be its coincidental but just thought to mention those similarities too. And also, try to see this movie. Inspector Gadget:  The whole story is same as Endhiran. Deiva Thirumagal: 3. Tamil Super Hit film \" Deiva Thirumagal (2011)\" was adapted from Sean Penn's Oscar nominated flick \" I am Sam (2001)\". It has been also noted that this film was already been unofficially remade in Bollywood as \" Main Aisa Hi Hoon (2005)\".Also in the tamil version famous song \" Papa paapa \" was shamefully copied by G.V.Prakash from a cartoon named \"Robin Hood (1973)\".  Devar Magan and Nayakan: 4. Tamil Cinema's all time Masterpieces ' Kamal Hassan's Nayakan (1987)' & Thevar Magan draws inspiration from the Hollywood's master piece ' The Godfather (1972)'. Although it has already been stated that Kamal Hassan's Nayakan partially based real life story of Varadarajan Muniswami Mudaliar.But this film got heavily inspired from Godfather 1 & 2. Nayakan Scenes Inspired from The Godfather :  Kamal Hassan's getup and gestures inspired from Marlon Brando (The Godfather). After the death of Marlon Brando ( Vito Corleone) ,and during the christening Connie's ( Marlon Brando's daughter) son ,AL Pacino orders to kill other dons. In Nayakan , after the death of Saranya ( His wife ), Kamal kills other dons in Mumbai during last rites (Pindam Karaithal ) and there are many scenes which proves that the film is the tamil adaptation of The Godfather.Thevar Magan scenes inspired from Godfather : In Godfather , Marlon Brando death scene while playing with his grand son and similarly Sivaji Ganasen's death scene in the movie Thevar Magan while playing with his grand daughters. Even though the essence of those scenes are similar , the style and construction are different.There are also another scene inspiration for Rajni Kanth's Annamalai , Rajni hits his sister's husband for torturing her . There is a similar scene in Godfather too where Al Pacino does it. Gajini: 5. A.R.Murugadoss's Blockbuster\" Ghajini ( Tamil/Hindi ) \"were the uncredited adaptation of Chris Nolan's First kind of Master piece to get placed in IMdb Top 250 \"Memento (2000)\"  Just like Batman says \" One man's tool is another man's weapon \",that's true in this case .The Tamil director made two films from a single Hollywood flick & earned a name for himself in Bollywood as well & this also gave decent platform for actress 'Asin' to enter Bollywood. 6. Bahubali:   8. Baby: (upcoming movie)  9. I  10. Kaththi  11. Uthama Villain:  12. Vishwaroopam:  Source: Log In or Sign Up - Facebook. Thank you\u2026. :) ",
