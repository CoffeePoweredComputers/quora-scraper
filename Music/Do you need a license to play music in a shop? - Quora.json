            "answer_text": "Have you ever witnessed a store or shop without music? How boring it is right? Good music always attracts visitors and keep shoppers engaged which increases sales opportunities in the shop. Yes, you need to obtain a license to play music from the copyright societies by paying a nominal amount as per their rate card. PPL and Novex has top music labels from the Indian Music Industry which includes Zee Music Company, T-Series, Eros Music, Sony Music India, YRF and many more So it is always recommended to take both PPL and Novex License and avoid getting into any copyright infringement.

            "answer_text": "You have not said where you are, but in the UK you do not need a licence as such, but you do need to pay royalties for the music, even if that is a radio station you are rebroadcasting. Contact the PPL PRS to get one. If you only pay music that is either copyright free, or that you have the full copyright to (such as something you created), then you don\u2019t need to pay them. Good luck proving that, though - they can be very aggressive. ",
