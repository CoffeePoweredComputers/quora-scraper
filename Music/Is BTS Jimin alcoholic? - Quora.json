            "answer_text": "I personally don\u2019t think so, ofc on Vlivs we have seen him drink the most out of all the members and he has stated he likes drinking beer. I know we do not see what goes in behind the camera but I just don\u2019t think he is. I mean he\u2019s 22, being in your early 20s is like prime time to drink.like say your in collage, do you know how many collage kids drink? A lot, but most of them are not alcoholics. Both of my brothers are 22 and 23 and they go out to parties and go to bars a lot and drink cause that\u2019s how a lot of people have fun. But my siblings are no where near being alcoholics, there just having fun being in there early 20s. And maybe that\u2019s what Jimin likes to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026.You are very lucky that I got your question! LOL\u2026.Actually today I was watching some BTS vidos and I saw in YouTube about Park Jimin\u2019s alcholic habit. I would say that not only Jimin but none of the BTS memebrs are alcoholic. Jimin once said that whenever he gets too much stressed, he drinks wisky or champage. Well, it\u2019s true because if you ask to any person, he/she will surely say, they drink when they stressed. It\u2019s true though. And we all know how much BTS work in a day. Even more than we can imagine. They have to do voclal, rap, dance practises for hours. And Jimin being the Main Dancer, has to concentrate so much in dancing which surely makes him exhasuted. So I think he drinks only to take away his stress and exhaustion. Thats all\u2026.. ",
