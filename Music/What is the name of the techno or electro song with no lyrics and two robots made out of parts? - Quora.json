            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a German band (whom I absolutely love) called Kraftwerk (\u201cPower Plant\u201d) that has a history of setting up the stage for robots. When they began, they would disguise themselves as robots, with thick make-up and \u201crobotic\u201d gestures, but also using dolls to represent them:  This is an updated version of the same video concept (I still prefer the original):  In the early nineties they had a show called \u201cThe Mix\u201d in which they didn\u2019t actually show up, but only robots that really \u201cdanced mechanically\u201d to a prerecorded tune:  Problem is: You can\u2019t describe Kraftwerk\u2019s music as \u201cmusic that lift you up\u201d but rather as \u201cmusic that kills down your mood and convince you that this post-modern world is going to be ever shittier\u201d.  Korrekt? ",
