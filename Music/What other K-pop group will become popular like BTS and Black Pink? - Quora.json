Maybe they\u2019ll become really big one day. As for boygroups I hope ATEEZ becomes the next big thing after BTS. NCT is another group that comes to mind,but it\u2019s just too many members and I\u2019m pretty sure people won\u2019t be too interested due to the facts that it\u2019s sub-units and a lot of members(I still love you NCT). But yeah ATEEZ definitely deserves all the popularity and fame. Well these are the groups that I would like to see become just as popular as BTS and BlackPink. Now I don\u2019t know who will most likely come on top we just need to wait until that day comes. ",

            "answer_text": "No group will EVER pass TWICE, BLACKPINK, and BTS in success and popularity. ( I mention TWICE because I want to emphasize how successful K-pop groups are. ) Never. Why? They have outsold records. They have the biggest and most iconic hits. (Cheer Up, D4, Wings Album) They are the most successful groups. BTS might win a Grammy, maybe! Blackpink have been one of the first girlgroups at Coachella. TWICE outsell every.single.album. TWICE literally win award after award for their songs. In just 1 day they can literally outsell. No group will ever pass those 3 I mentioned. NEVER. This is a fact ok. But there will be little brothers/sisters that can take on records --> records. But they will never be as successful as those groups. Have a Sana.  ",
