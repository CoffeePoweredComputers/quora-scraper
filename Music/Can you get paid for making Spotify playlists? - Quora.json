            "answer_text": "I must say something important. There MIGHT be indirect ways to monetize it (*), but asking for money to include any artist\u2019s track in your playlist is illegal. However I know that several curators do that, and I get messages on a regular basis asking for money that range from \u201c15 dollars to just listen my track\u201d and \u201cif I like it, I include it\u201d up to 100 dollars a track. And I am talking about playlists that (a) don\u2019t have a great number of followers (say 10.000) from which you still have to check how many are actually listening. Or didn\u2019t you know that you can buy fake followers? It is clearly against Spotify\u2019s Terms and Conditions of Use. Concretely: The following is not permitted for any reason whatsoever: (\u2026) selling a user account or playlist, or otherwise accepting any compensation, financial or otherwise, to influence the name of an account or playlist or the content included on an account or playlist.(*) Having said that, you have legal ways of monetising your playlists indirectly, for instance: Make a Patreon page and say your supporters that you are creating playlistsMake a landing page where you talk about your playlists and music taste, and include adds thereimagination is your limitJuan Maria Solare ",
