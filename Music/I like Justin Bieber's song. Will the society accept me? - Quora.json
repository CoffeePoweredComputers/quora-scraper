            "answer_text": "Why are you concerned? People are different in their likes, dislikes, interests, and dreams. I will go out on a limb here and tell you that society does not care what songs you like, nor do they care about the hair you like, or the type of pet you would like to have. Incase nobody told you, society is extremely self centered. I\u2019m not saying that is right or wrong, just that it is. I saw one of the other answers mentioned homosexuality, and I will expound on that a bit. People do not care who you sleep with. They only care when it is against what they believe and are forced to face it in daily life. I know many raise the moral dillema and God and scripture, and whatever\u2026 But why would they be angry about a lifestyle they were not forced to be confronted by? Is anyone not able to sleep because 2 people of the same gender are somewhere on earth at that moment having sex? Truly?! I know that I don\u2019t care what people do, as long as no one is being forced against their will and as long as I am not required to take note of it. \u201cOh its Friday at noon, mark and john must be going at it.\u201d I hate to say it this way, but who the hell cares what song you like? More imporntantly why are you concerned? I won\u2019t have an issue with it unless I see a headline stating that someone was held hostage by a crazed Beiber fan and forced to listen to Baby on repeat for 7 days straight. Even then I may not think much about it beyond that\u2026 So by all means, get your beiber on! ",

So what? Suffice to say, society, your peers, your friends, others and suchlike will have their subjective opinions. You\u2019ll be fine and much more respected if you stand by your values and preferences. ",
