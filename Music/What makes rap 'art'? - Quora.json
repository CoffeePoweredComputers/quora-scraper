            "answer_text": "By definition, art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination. This can mean that ANYTHING can be art as you see fit! Personally, I believe rap is art because it expresses emotional concepts (and not just your typical angry rara stuff). The instrumental gives you a setting and the artist performing is the tour guide. I also view it as an audible painting too. ",
