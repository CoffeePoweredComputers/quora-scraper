            "answer_text": "If you prefer clarity and detail, the Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 can be regularly picked up for a price less than $200 (retail price: $400). They are triple balanced armature driver in-ear monitors which has a driver each for bass, mids and treble.  I picked up a brand new pair for about $130 recently. While fit is an issue for some TF10 owners (the housing is pretty large), and mids with the stock cable aren't exactly the best, the issue can be easily remediated by use of an after market cable which can be purchased for as low as $40. Another pair worth considering in your budget is the Phaiton PS 200 ($200) which scores exceptionally in all departments and has a very pleasing sound signature.  Some other earphones you might also want to look into are Fischer Audio DBA-02 ($160, but availability is a bit of an issue), Sunrise SW Xcape ($80, again availability is an issue) and MEElectronics CC51 ($80) which offer fantastic value for money. I would ONLY recommend Etymotics if you like absolutely flat response, analytical earphones. They don't make for fun listening at all, but do offer very accurate reproduction of sound. Head-fi, the audiophile community has a fantastic thread summarizing the IEMs mentioned above:http://www.head-fi.org/forum/thread/478568/ ",
