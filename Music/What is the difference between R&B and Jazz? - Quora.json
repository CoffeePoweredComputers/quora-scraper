            "answer_text": "both genres obviously share a common ancestry with an older form, the blues. in their time lines, r\u2019n\u2019b emerged roughly two to three generations after jazz did. it was largely a creation of a northern migration, mostly within the u.s., from the original cradle of blues and jazz, which went on between the two world wars, the industrial boom of the second world war, and the early cold war period. jazz musicians were among the earliest migrants, getting their start before the great war, using the same routes, the river, highways, and railroad, to many of the very same places like Chicago. the 1950s saw r\u2019n\u2019b emerging as a popular music, bebop transforming to post-bebop post-modern jazz, and the first generation of what the u.s. calls \u2018baby boomers\u2019 coming of age. it\u2019s why both jazz and r\u2019n\u2019b are associated with the reform movements for civil rights and the Viet Nam war. it\u2019s possible something similar to the r\u2019n\u2019b we know could have evolved without the big dose of urban influences, which included jazz, but musicians being as fluid and mobile in their choice of workplace as they are, we\u2019ll never know. we\u2019re reminded of their consanguinity every time there\u2019s a jazz arrangement of an r\u2019n\u2019b tune, or of course one adapted in the other direction. hip hop uses samples of classic jazz recordings, for that matter. the distinctive \u2018motown sound\u2019 from Detroit came from jazz musicians, and the city is associated with many great players through the years. if you listen closely to arrangements on the recordings of r\u2019n\u2019b classics, you can often distinguish the Det made recordings from those of Memphis or Muscle Shoals or Philadelphia. as for what differentiates the two genres when we experience them, here\u2019s one reductionist model, and better qualified musicologists might have something more sophisticated. for r\u2019n\u2019b, the rhythmic foundation provided by two specific instruments, the bass and the drums, has narrower parameters for providing the pulse, and its syncopation is more structured. the structure is very close to Afro-american church music, usually cited as a principal source for r\u2019n\u2019b, also closely associated with the civil rights movement of the early 60s. improvisation is a secondary priority in r\u2019n\u2019b or church music. jazz simply permits more liberties, far more with some practitioners.
