            "answer_text": "This answer assumes the OP is not a musician but just a regular joe/jane who wants to try recording his/her singing voice AND that this person is not just being overly self-critical. While I appreciate the kind manner in which most folks here responded, they leaped right past the most obvious solution based on the question as it is posed: the OP\u2019s voice sounds horrible when recorded because he or she actually can\u2019t sing. This is a rather common phenomenon in modern times due to technology allowing us to sing along with recordings, which covers up how terrible most people sound when they \u201csing.\u201d I assume that it still occurred before Edison invented the phonograph but less frequently, as the only other way I can think of to achieve this effect would be singing in a group, like in church, where the sound or pitchiness of the voice is masked by other voices. Yes, it\u2019s sad but true: the other answers here point out a valid phenomenon in which both our speaking AND singing voices sound different out in front of us that they do in our heads. As a professional singer, I typically stand in front of a wall, about a foot away from it, and sing right at it when I\u2019m warming up or working on a particular sound; it allows me to really hear myself in the \u201creal world\u201d and not just my own head. The sound reflected directly back at your ears from the wall is the closest thing you\u2019ll get to hearing how you actually sound, unless you were to setup a microphone in a decent room and sing into it with headphones on. In my mind, the only way to resolve this is to a) get a more detailed question (what does the OP mean when he/she says \u201csound?\u201d Is it a pitch issue? Is it a tone issue? Or what?), or 2) have the OP go to a professional voice coach/instructor and sing for that person; they\u2019re usually pretty honest about how good one\u2019s voice is or if one can actually sing at all.

            "answer_text": "All of the above answers are good ones. I'll add something I noticed myself. I've been recording since I was in high school, but mostly other people. I sang in bands that pretty much never got recorded, and when I was recording, mixing, etc. it was for others. I eventually got more serious about doing my own music, and I found for a long time that I didn't like my recorded voice. All of the scientific reasons are correct, and for the purposes of simplicity, let\u2019s assume that you actually do sound good to other people and you\u2019re not just fooling yourself singing in the shower, etc. So it\u2019s how your hear from within versus how your voice as others hear it. The one thing I ran into, as both a singer and a some-time recording engineer, really amounts to a weird psychological thing... it's kind of a singer\u2019s version of \"the uncanny valley\". That's a term from computer animation: we're fine with animated people up to certain point of realism. Then they start to get kind of creepy... if you've ever seen \"The Polar Express\", that's a good example. After a bit more realism, we accept them. I think there's kind of that valley in hearing a singer -- when it's not you, you'll accept it. As it gets close to you, as you know it's you, but it's not the way you hear yourself, it kind of freaks you out. Fortunately, you can get over this by listening to yourself. Lots. When I have four or five vocal tracks, 5-10 or more takes of each one, on a project, I get pretty used to what I sound like. I used to do lots of overdubs or effects, but at some point realized that it wasn't me (well, not always), but my brain's rejection of the not-quite-me, that was the problem. So stopped doing that, did a few things with no overdubs (harmonies, sure, but plenty of lone vocal parts), and pretty much grew to accept it. It's also important to have a good quality recording of yourself. As others have mentioned, that's good room acoustics, that's a good performance, that's using good quality recording gear that's set up correctly. At some point, it's even the case that you may find specific microphones that flatter your voice (and by extension, those that do not). I have a kit of 20+ mics that helps here, but that's not usually necessary if everything's set up well. Read More 10 Creepy Examples of the Uncanny Valley ",
