            "answer_text": "It was said that she earned this title because of her many accomplishments but not everyone felt that way. From what some of our parents told us they read about her and some who had worked with her, since the start of the Supremes Diana Ross was also known as the HBIC of the group which later tied her to the name \u201c The Boss \u201c as well. Diana Ross boasted of class but many saw her as dictatorial and commanding . I have never been a fan of Diana Ross but I cannot take away her accolades because she deserved them, but she earned the title on a personal level as well as a professional one. It is a character flaw in part, meaning that the title wasn't given totally as a compliment, it has been said that she was always on the come up by any means necessary, so even I have to admit that she truly earned the title of \u201c The Boss. \u201c as ",

            "answer_text": " Diana Ross was called \u201cThe Boss\u201d following the release of her 1979 album \u201cThe Boss\u201d and her 1979 hit single \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Diana could also be assertive, dominant and directive as she found her feet in the world moving further away from the influence of Berry Gordy and Motown at this time in her life [she signed with RCA in 1981], and she could be pretty bossy herself, hence the name of the 1979 Album and Single stuck. I believe Diana quite liked this nickname. NB. Diana made a guest appearance on Sesame Street in 1981 where she rang \u201cBelieve in Yourself\u201d to Big Bird.  Bird Bird , whether as a result of nerves or an error, or perhaps even deliberately, went to call Diana Miss Ross, but instead called her Miss Boss ! ",
