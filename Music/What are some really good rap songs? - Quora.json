            "answer_text": "This question is impossible to answer exhaustively since I haven't listened to all of hip hop. Also, there are many ways to judge a rap song (lyrics, beat, flow, story, messaging) and different elements appeal to different people.Given these difficulties, I will choose songs made by artists that I know well where the artist's particular skills are used to their fullest. Notorious BIG - Me and My Bitch A real, hood, and heartfelt love song.Showcases Biggie's excellent narrative abilities, adept use of shock value, and his use of simple diction to create intricate rhymes.Ice cube - It Was a Good Day An apt description of the perfect day in the life of a gangster in Los Angeles.Cube cleverly exposes the world to the myriad of dangers one may encounter in South Central, LA by describing a day devoid of these pitfalls.Jay-z - Song Cry A catalog of a failed relationship, seemingly told from experience.Shows the more introspective side of Jay. Still talking about himself, but in this song he is being humble and pensive instead of simply being boastful.Eminem - Rabbit Run A relentless rhythmic representation of determination.A great example of Eminem's ability to combine technical mastery with emotion to create an intense listening experience.LL Cool J - I Need Love The first successful hip hop love song.Showcases L's versatility (listen to this after \"Mama said knock you out\"), and is an example of hip hop's potential for broad appeal Lupe Fiasco - Dumb it Down A masterpiece that decries the trend toward less complexity (aka \"Retard Rap\") in hip hop.The rhymes are dense, and each verse has a meticulous structure that underscores the content.Unlike other songs that complain about hip hop, he offers a solution to the problem in the song (and, by extension, with the song itself).Nas - One Love Nas writes a letter to his homie in prison.He paints a vivid picture of the perils of hood life as he updates his friend on what has been going on in the neighborhood since he got locked up.2pac - So Many Tears A song about the pain endured through his lifetime.This is 2pac as his introspective best, exposing the world to much of the pain he and many others in similar situations have experienced.Talib Kweli - Africa Dream A powerful commentary on the state of black America and hip hop music.Shows off Kweli's agility, poignancy, and  commitment to meaningful hip hop.Mos Def - Mathematics A mathematically themed catalog of world injustice.The mighty Mos Def uses numbers and mathematical phrasing to rhyme, delight, and enlighten.Cee-Lo Green - Sometimes Poetic musings on life lessons, creativity, and self-actualization.Cee-Lo's exhibits his ability to excel in different forms of expression, combining idioms of spoken word, hip hop, and narration.",
