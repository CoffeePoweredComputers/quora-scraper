            "answer_text": "Human being are special and very different from anything else that exists on the known planets , We have GIFTS ,ABILITIES,POWER,that is not with anything else and because of this we have special advantage ,or strength over other things. one of he most researched topics or question is what is our ultimate goal/need/want as a human being?Sometimes it has been described using the Marslows Hierachy of needs etc with one of the outstanding outcomes in most of these being happiness ,satisfaction. Keera was 24 years old ,she loved soccer ,by love means she spoke the soccer language even more fluent than the coach the players ,during one of the soccer events she sat next to this nerd looking gentleman who later ended up to be a special person to her ,he was educated ,young at 27 he was working on his PHD with a second masters course aside ,he loved soccer ,music from his music player and fishing.We all know by now this is headed to be a love story unfortunately its not ,now keera was excited to meet Mr Nerd and they talked for hours with no signs of boredom. Keera and Mr Nerd were over the moon for each others company ,when they stopped me and asked me to take a photo of them in the neighborhood as i walked home from the gym i said to myself this is my ideal couple they looked close laughed so loudly and happily on the road shared music from an Mp3 player and at some point they seemed like they were dancing. I took hundreds of photos on each of their i phones and they smiled with lot of gratitude ,i walked away saying to myself where are these perfect gentlemen .Keera may have missed a step and all i heard was a THUD!!!!!!!!!!!!and the Mp3 lay on the jogging path in pieces ,Mr Nerd was screaming his heart out about the volumes of music he lost with his player is in pieces ,as he bend to pick up bits of it,Keera struggled to get up from the ground and looked injured ,Mr Nerd was drinking fruit juice that was not sealed in its cup and so it all spills on Keera\u2019s white Chelsea jersey . At this point i had rushed back and was approaching them when Keera screamed now look you ruined my 670$ jersey with your st******juice ,her knee was bleeding ,but she didn't seem like she noticed ,and so would not stop yelling at Mr Nerd about her dear soccer jersey her favorite team blahablaha Mr Nerd yells back you started it you broke my Mp3 player all my music is gone. i will cut this short to drive my point at home .When Keera left the house that morning she was so attached and in love with the Chelsea jersey because she loved soccer she loved that club she loved her jersey even more it brought her close to the one thing that brightened her days . Mr Nerd cant cook,cant read,cant go to the toilet unless he is with his music player ,and that morning he downloaded his favorite MJ album to make the day more memorable . Both guys had their most treasured and loved item on them and shared about them when they first met with Nerd talking about his playlist and Keera about her collection of various jerseys for different seasons etc .But at this point Keera cursed how ugly her outfit was,that she will never wear it again how she hated going anywhere meeting anyone etc she was spitting venom of the misfortunate event ,Mr Nerd was less bothered with his newfound friend\u2019s injury and went on and on lamenting about his lost music.Both scenarios they instantly get crushed and reduce the energy and excitement they had for soccer and music but now it seems like its been taken away from them forever .That is how we are as humans we have power to decide how to react to situations ,the ability to handle situations and the gift to identify the best for us .that is how we end up sort of loosing love instantly for what we had initially .I hope this is helpful.

            "answer_text": "The universe is based on polarity. \u201cLove me or hate me, both are in my favor. If you love me, I'll always be in your heart... If you hate me, I'll always be in your mind.\u201d Your focus, no matter the intent will draw you to something in love or hate. It is only a matter of moments when one can be turned from the arms of love into hate due to relations breaking if not mindful and careful with the heart. Preoccupation leads to destination, no matter the reason. ",
