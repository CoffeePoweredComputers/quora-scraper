            "answer_text": "1.Led Zeppelin-Stairway to Heaven The poetic storytelling nature of Robert Plant's lyrics combined with Jimmy Page's brilliant musical composition places \"Stairway To Heaven\" as the number one rock song of all time. Mr. Page's arrangement of a dramatic crescendo type development with the song passing through stages along the way lend to his (and John Paul Jones) influence by classical music. His guitar solo in this song is one of his greatest played with undeniable passion and ease. \"Stairway To Heaven\" is a legendary song composed and performed by the greatest rock musicians of all time, Led Zeppelin. Jimmy Page one of the first guitar heroes, along with Ritchie Blackmore, Jimmy Hendrix & Eric Clapton, had wrote one of the most iconic guitar solos of all time. Plants vocals were amazing as they were progressive. The progression of the song is what most sticks out as it schizophrenically transitions from smooth, calming folk music to extremely emotional & groundbreaking hard rock/heavy metal.  2.Queen-Bohemian Rhapsody When the writer of this song, the late Freddie Mercury had come into this studio with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the rest of the band had thought of it foolish, bizarre and odd---but went along with the \"Fred thing\"---now it is a masterpiece that has withstood time, even more than thirty years old----nothing, and no one has come close to re-creating something so tongue-and-cheek, innovative, and still makes teenagers want to bang their heads and air-guitar while driving. Simply one of the best.  3.Pink Floyd-Comfortably Numb While other 70\u2032s songs such as Bohemian Rhapsody, Hotel California, and Stairway to Heaven are great songs, Comfortably Numb is also a genius composition. The opening notes are beautiful but melancholic and set the stage for Pink's story (the main character in the album, not the musician.) The music shapes the journey of a troubled rockstar struggling to get through his every day life. That combined with brilliant lyrics, a heartfelt chorus- \"I have become Comfortably Numb\"- and guitar solo that sends a shiver down your spine, this is truly a song worthy of being called one of the best songs ever. I'll say it again, Comfortably Numb is an absolutely genius composition.  4. Bob Dylan-Like a rolling stone An exquisite piece of poetry. The surreal nature of this work results in it requiring many revisits to truly understand its meaning. even on the thousandth visit you find yourself suddenly realising what the artist is trying to tell you. It questions the very nature of society and the way it looks towards certain trends.  5. Lynyrd Skynyrd-Free bird If i had to describe this song in a single word it would be \u201cEargasm\u201d. \"Free Bird\" also achieved the No. 3 spot on Guitar World's 100 Greatest Guitar Solos. It is used as a finale by Lynyrd Skynyrd during their live performances and is their longest song, often going well over 14 minutes when played live. It is considered to be Lynyrd Skynyrd's signature song. The song\u2014half ballad, half up-tempo guitar solo\u2014quickly became a staple for Lynyrd Skynyrd at their live performances. Many recognize its 5:12 triple guitar solo section that closes it out. It often turned into an extended jam session at concerts. The band would consistently play it as the last song of every show, as it was their biggest crowd pleaser. Overall the song proved to be a huge hit for Lynyrd Skynyrd and it remains a fan favorite to this day. It is also a classic rock radio staple. It has become something of a humorous tradition for audience members at concerts to shout \"Free Bird\" as a request to hear the song, regardless of the performer or style of music. The phenomenon began earlier in the 1970s with The Allman Brother\u2019s Band \u201cWhipping Post\" and Deep Purple\u2019s \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d but then took off with \"Free Bird\" by 1979. On Skynyrd's first live album, 1976's \u201cOne more from the road\u201d Van Zant can be heard asking the crowd, \"What song is it you wanna hear?\" The deafening calls for \"Free Bird\" lead into a 14-minute rendition of the song. Kevin Matthews claimed to have further popularized it in the 1980s from his Chicago area area radio show.  It\u2019d have been better if you would have specefied the genre :P Thanks for A2A :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you asked me this question 100 days in a row, I could easily give you 100 different answers. I suppose I could come up with some seemingly \"objective\" criteria, but ultimately it comes down to something extremely subjective: what song most stimulates the pleasure centers of my brain. But what the heck, I'll give it a shot. A great song has most (or all) of the following factors going for it (in descending order of importance):  Emotional impact (are you riveted while it's playing? Blown away when it's over?)Does it succeed in its intended purpose? (If it's trying to be a tearjerker, or a party tune, or a political statement--how well does it achieve this goal?)Melodic and/or Rhythmic Sophistication (does it avoid cliches? Did that chord sequence or key change or tempo shift make you snap to attention and think \"Huh--didn't expect that?\")Lyrical content (Yes, lyrics are important, and obviously lyrics can be a huge part of the emotional impact of a song. I love great lyricists like Bob Dylan or John Prine. But for me melody always comes first. There are songs that I've loved for decades that I still don't know the lyrics to, and it doesn't bother me a bit).So given the above criteria, it's no surprise that Brian Wilson often occupies the top spot for me at any given time. Here are three amazing songs, all pretty different in intent, with lyrics by Tony Asher, Van Dyke Parks, and Brian himself, respectively: God Only Knows - Tom Petty once said that putting this song in the same ballpark as a Bach piece \"wouldn't be out of line.\" I just wish that last round would repeat for about a minute longer...  Surf's Up - this was to be the centerpiece of the aborted Smile project, but when it imploded it took another five years for the song to surface. Decades later Smile was resurrected to a rapturous response from critics and audiences alike. A solo piano version of this was featured in a \"Leonard Bernstein bestows his blessing on rock\" TV special in 1967. I love Carl Wilson's amazing vocal on the first section, and Brian's vocal on the second half.    'Til I Die - An incredibly moving meditation on mortality, and Brian's simple lyrics fit the song perfectly (much as John Lennon's lyrics do in Because). Brian does all the vocal parts until the very end, when the other Beach Boys join in to great emotional effect. Just devastating!  Wichita Lineman - (performed by Glen Campbell, written by Jimmy Webb). Possibly the perfect pop single, with a chord progression that looks absolutely crazy on paper but works like a charm when you hear it. The sense of longing, of being bound by duty to be separated from a loved one, has never been expressed so well.   Darkness, Darkness - The Youngbloods (written by Jesse Colin Young). This was a bold choice to open their Elephant Mountain LP in 1969, since its dark subject matter (written from the perspective of a heroin-addicted Vietnam soldier) was quite uncharacteristic for the jug-band, good-timey Youngbloods. From the opening strains of David Lindley's modal fiddle, to the way it slowly builds from a folky acoustic vibe to a more restless mood, to a full-out cry of pain with distorted electric guitar, make it one of the most stunning works in rock. The whole album is one of the undiscovered treasures of 1969--indeed, of any year!    Goin' Back -  The Byrds (written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin). A terrific performance of a song that expresses a world-weary adult's regret for all the forgotten joys of childhood. David Crosby hated this song so much he left the group, proving that there's no accounting for taste!  OK, that's a very small sample...in about 15 minutes I could give you a completely different list! ",
