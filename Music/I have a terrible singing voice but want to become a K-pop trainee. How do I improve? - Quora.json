            "answer_text": "Well hello there, im not a kpop trainee and definitely not a singer but I've loved music my entire life anf i have studied music practically not professionally so here are some tricks which helps singers or kpop trainees.  Breath from your diaphragm \u2013 take a deep breath into your belly, not your chest.Open your mouth \u2013 if you want to project and be heard, you need to open your mouth. It sounds simple, but many people do not practice this.Blow bubbles \u2013 this is a great exercise to practice sustaining your breath when you speak.Ground yourself \u2013 squeeze your muscles or sit on your hands. When you\u2019re physically connected, you come from a much more stable base from which to speak. Your voice, as a result, will sound more confident and grounded.Play with your vocal range by singing in the shower \u2013 yes, you read correctly!Go up the stairs and down the stairs \u2013 read a poem or piece of prose. Start low, and then go high with your voice, then go low again. This is great for people who speak very monotone \u2013 adding more vocal range helps you to be more engaging and interesting to listen to.Go fast and slow \u2013 similar to the exercise above. Practice reading something reallyfastwithouttakingabreak\u2026and then. Slow it. Right. Down.Use your hands \u2013 I find that when I gesticulate with my hands, I come across more energetic. If you naturally don\u2019t gesticulate a lot, that\u2019s ok. Instead, focus on relaxing your body.Play with resonance. Low resonance makes us sound a bit more nasally (it\u2019s the \u2018a\u2019 sound in \u2018cat\u2019). It\u2019s great for cutting through noise and getting people\u2019s attention. High resonance is more rounded (think a British accent), which makes us sound warmer, comforting and approachable.Cape, crown and headlights \u2013 a NIDA trick I learned many years ago. Listen to the episode as I take you through the exercise!Believe your voice deserves to be heard. Yes, your mindset is so important for tying all of this together. If you want to build your self confidence and self worth, and be more effective at talking about yourself Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "I can give o\\you a few vocal warm-up videos to help. but it is really just practice. One thing I see a lot of people get wrong when they are trying to sing is that they just keep singing the song over and over again. What you need to do is take maybe 5\u201310 seconds of the song at a time and keep on practicing that until you can record it and like how it sounds. If you struggle with the high notes make sure that you practice those EVERY DAY. this really helps because you are training your voice to go higher and if you do it every day you should see improvements Now for vocal warmups Zzz (basically go up and down a scale making a z sound like a buzzing one everyday)      of course, these are just a few and you can search up vocal warm-ups on youtube for more. I hope this helped you! ",
