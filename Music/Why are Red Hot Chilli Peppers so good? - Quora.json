Say, if that person was primarily into a completely different genre, like jazz, reggae, folk, salsa, classical, industrial, samba or hip-hop, and, besides, thought that RHCP and any other music like it just plain sounded terrible. Would that person, then, somehow be indisputably wrong? I mean, really, what kind of question is this?? What kind of answers are you expecting to find here?? Are you trying to make some kind of statement along the lines of \u201cOMG how are RHCP just so AWESOME?!?!\u201d Or, are you genuinely in doubt as to which elements of RHCP\u2019s music that their listeners are into? While I can only speak for myself, I like RHCP because their music makes me in a good mood; because I like their distinct, unique sound, and because they rock. But I can\u2019t possibly elaborate on why any of these elements appeal to me. So, once again, I implore of you to ask yourself what kinds of answers you\u2019re expecting to find here. Because I see this type of question far too often here, and to me it just seems subversive to the entire concept behind something like Quora. ",
