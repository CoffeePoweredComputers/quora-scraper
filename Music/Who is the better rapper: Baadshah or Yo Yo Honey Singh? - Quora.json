            "answer_text": "I don't know why but few people gave Rubbish answer to this question. I agree that Naezy , Divine, Brodha v, Emiway are excellent rappers but till now they are not commercial success (except Divine). I know that hip hop is not about commercial success, but to be hit you need to know the taste of people . And complete rap songs are not as successful in India as Desi Hip Hop. Actually Desi hip hop is fusion of pop and rap. Honey, Badshah, Millind Gaba do this fusion and so they are hit. (This was just for people who were writing shits about Honey and Badshah) .   Now coming to the question. Lets comapre both of them side by side through their best songs . Honey singh DESI HIP HOP SONGS BROWN RANGBLUE EYESHIGH HEELSLOVE DOSEANGREZI BEATSUPERMANCALL AUNDIDESI KALAKAARPARTY SONGS PARTY ALL NIGHTRAAT JASHAN DIDIL CHORIPARTY GETTING HOTBREAK UP PARTYALCOHOLICSUNNY SUNNYJHONNY JHONNYLUNGI DANCEONE BOTTLE DOWNANKHON ANKHONKUDI TU BUTTERDOPE SHOPELAKK 28YAAR NA MILEYCHOTE CHOTE PEGGBADSHAH  DESI HIP HOP SONGS : KHOL BOTTLE FT.

Both are Equally hit. But Honey has made much more songs than Badshah. And he didn't made just songs rather he makes Anthem. Rapping skills :  Honey songh : Honey singh raps in a singing style ,But :He rapped really great in International villager. For example Brown Rang, High Heels, DOPE Shope , Angrezi beat, break up party, chaskaSuddenly he shifted to party song, he rapped less and sang more for example: Party all night, lungi Dance, Jhonny Jhonny, yaar Na miley, Ataa mazi satakli (his worst song), sunny sunny .In between , he gave few songs which were fusion of HIP-HOP and POP , like Blue Eyes, Isey kehte Hip Hip , Dheere Dheere .He released his 3rd album Desi Kalakaar which had awesome HIP-HOP songs like Desi Kalakaar (title track) , love Dose , Stardom and at the same time it had great pop songs like Chal Mere Ghar, Daftaar ki Girl .Honey has amazing rapping skills but he prefers to singing over rapping .  2. BADSHAH: HE RAPS IN HARD VOICE WITH VERY CATCHY LYRICS AND VOCALS. HE HAS RAPPED IN ALL HIS SONGS.BUT PROBLEM IS HE USES WORD BABY TOO MUCH .HE ONLY RAPS ABOUT FIGURE, PARTY AND DANCE SO ALMOST ALL HIS RAPS SOUND VERY SAMEStill Badshah is no doubt a great rapper in terms of popularity and success. Its very difficult for me to say who is better because both are hit and successful. Saying any one of them better will be injustice to other one.        But still yo yo Honey singh is the man who introduced rap to masses in India and inspired many upcoming talents. He is the man who single handedly changed the entire music culture of India and brought a revolution in Indian Music Industry . So I'll prefer this Man:  This video has everything that Badshah copied from Honey Singh . CHECK THIS LINK  Thank you so much!! UPVOTE \u261d, if you are A yo yo fan . ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Depends on who you ask. Majority of the rap these people do revolves around parties, alcohol and girls. Both compete to make sillier songs. However, it should be noted that Badshah is capable of writing good raps. Not great, but good. Check Baatcheet, Bandook, Inception. Honey Singh is a DJ/Music Composer turned rapper. His music is better than Badshah's. He is doing it for more time, and supposedly he too had written good raps.  Check Bhagat Singh remix, Jatt Soorme. Among these two, I believe Badshah is better. But end of the day both are just doing commercial party songs, so can't expect much quality. ",
