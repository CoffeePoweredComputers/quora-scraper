            "answer_text": "Same with me bro. This is my opinion after speculating about this issue. I think when you uninstalled it and install it back at the moment, Tiktok\u2019s update has turned out;-Mic\u2019s removed-Layout features have taken away-Limiting the effects and;-some few features(comment down below if I missed something) It\u2019s the same with the Musically before Tiktok\u2019s existed, at first there is no problem until I uninstall it (cos I got tired of using it) when I thought of using it again and reinstall it. There are features that had lost like, (1) you can\u2019t pick your own sound on your music playlist, (2)when I post my video privately, the video became really poor in quality and the same result even if I saved it to files. (3)The sound of the video is less timing and convenient in use(4)the Musically app itself had gone and replaced it to Tiktok. What I believe is that Tiktok is very selective to its users as if when you are not active anymore, it will tend to take away the features you wanted in the future. ",
