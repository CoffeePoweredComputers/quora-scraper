            "answer_text": "nobody knows 100% for sure but you also have to know Zimmy.. Many the speculations are true he did come off of a tour. maybe he was tired I don't know Bob does not like giant public performances people have known that for years. there's a reason he recorded an MP3 of something and gave it to them.. perhaps out of respect Bob didn't want to also be spotlighted on the great Bob Dylan the man who brought folk and rock together is here tonight. if you notice Pattie Boyd wasn't there either. it's also a possibility that Bob wasn't invited. Bob has never come out and said publicly the reason why he never attended the early 2000s concert for George.as for me and other surprise to the fact that Leon Russell was never invited either. think of his unbelievable version of beware of darkness.so we can basically speculate all we want but you mainly have to look into the mind of Bob Dylan would he have even came? you never know but the fact that he recorded a great cover of something and sent it to them definitely shows George was in his heart but people grieve in different ways perhaps he did not want to come maybe he was invited but he just didn't want too.

            "answer_text": "Dylan has never publicly stated why he did not participate. His then-current tour concluded a week prior to the tribute concert, so there was no conflict with dates from that. He was tentatively expected to take part, but about two weeks prior to the event, he announced without further explanation that he would be unable to be there. Possibly he was simply too exhausted from his own tour to perform, or maybe it was just too emotional for him. Or perhaps he was just \u201cbeing Dylan\u201d and decided the best way to honor his friend was not to get on a stage in front of the world, but to do so in other, quieter ways. Dylan did do a version of \u201cSomething\u201d during his tour in George\u2019s memory. ",
