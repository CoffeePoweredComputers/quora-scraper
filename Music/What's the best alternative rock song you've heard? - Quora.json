            "answer_text": "So, so many to choose from... So, I'm really lenient when it comes to the Alternative genre.  You see, I grew up in a time when hair-bands & classic rock were the norms for anything other than pop.  Until one day, I found this radio station that played rock that wasn't like the others.  The station was a small independent called KROQ in Pasadena, Ca. Man, that changed my whole world: I digress - My best Alternative song comes from 1979...  1. Yellow Pills - by 20/20 - that one popped my cherry... Older, but I think notable songs are as follows (in no particular order):Chamber of Hellos - by Wire TrainRock This Town - by The StraycatsBlister In The Sun - by the Violent FemmesI Will Follow - by U2Schism - by ToolRooster - by Alice In ChainsRing Of Fire - by Social DistortionShe Sells Sanctuary - by The CultPlush - by the Stone Temple PilotsUnder The Milky Way - by The ChurchThree Strange Days - by the School Of Fish 1979 and Disarmed - by the Smashing PumpkinsBlack & Yellow Ledbetter - by Pearl JamCome As You Are - by NirvanaTake A Picture - by FilterShould I Stay Or Should I Go - by The ClashJane Says - by Jane's AddictionPrimary - by The CureShe - by Green dayWhat's It Like - by EverlastMexican Moon - by Concrete BlondeAnything, Anything - By DramaramaThe Kids Aren't Alright - by The OffspringBizarre Love Triangle - by New OrderBring Me To Life - by Evanescence I Need You Around - by the Smoking Popes I hope these newer songs are going to get as much mileage as the ones above:Lazy Eye - by the Silversun PickupsAin't No rest For The Wicked - by Cage The ElephantRadioactive - by Imagine DragonsEvery Stone - by Manchester OrchestraHurricane - by Ms MrMadness - by MuseWelcome To The Black Parade - by My Chemical RomanceAfraid - by NeighborhoodMisery Business - by Paramore1901 - by Phoenix ",
