            "answer_text": "You have asked who sings better and not whose lyrics are better. If it would have been the case then Eminem would have taken a clear victory. Now let us examine their energies in songs. Eminem not only gives brilliant lyrics but also has gutted emotions in them at the same time his various songs depicts different emotions. He has various different attributes in different songs. Listen to Kim, when i am gone, lose yourself, my name is and headlights and you will feel the difference in his voice. Now we move towards the Canadian kid. All his songs have same genre and exceptionally same voice and enthusiasm, more or less he sings the same song. Although both of them are talented, but Em is far much better(according to me). Stan's rule over beliebers. ",

Its like asking Tiger Woods to play Cricket \u201c(I know you hit the ball, lets see if you can hit this one.)\u201d There is no connection, collaboration between these two people.
