            "answer_text": "Montessori is all about tapping into a child\u2019s natural inclination to learn. The classic toys that Montessori methods inspire are favorites of ours for this reason. Here are 11 of the best Montessori toys for a baby's first year, along with some tips on how to use them. 1. HIGH CONTRAST MONTESSORI BALL FOR BRAIN EYE CONNECTION  The soft Montessori ball is thoughtfully designed to be easy for babies to grasp and move. Moving a ball from one hand to the other is an important skill that your baby will develop \u2014 one that requires dexterity and enhanced coordination across his body. We recommend organic cotton for safe mouthing. Ideas for play: Practice eye tracking with babies 0 - 8 weeks by slowly moving the high contrast ball in front of your baby\u2019s view.During tummy time, have your baby reach for, grasp, grip, squeeze, and mouth the ball.Roll the ball back and forth in front of him to begin learning about how spheres move.At the end of month 6, your baby may be able to find objects that you partially hide under a blanket, pillow, or furniture. You can start to play hide-and-seek with the ball.2. CLASSIC WOOD RATTLE FOR TRACKING SOUNDS  Sometime in month 4, your baby will start to look for and track the sources of sounds he hears. He\u2019ll recognize the sound of his rattle, for instance, even when there are other noises in the background. Understanding that objects (and people!) can make sounds is an early lesson in cause and effect. This classic rattle is made with sustainably harvested wood and safe non-toxic water based paint. Ideas for play: Shake the rattle near your baby\u2019s face; keep rattling while moving it past his eyes until he notices the rattle\u2019s making a sound and starts tracking the sound with his eyes.For an early lesson in math shake the rattle in a rhythm\u2014e.g., Shake, shake, pause; shake, shake, pause\u2014and then vary the pattern. He\u2019ll soon be able to tell the difference between the number of shakes he\u2019s hearing.Help your baby shake the rattle and learn that two shakes feels different from three\u2014this helps him start building associations between numbers, sounds, and movement.3. HAND-TO-HAND TRANSFER DISCS FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN  Passing an object between two hands is a step babies work toward for months\u2014getting it right involves coordination across the center of his body. Skilled hand-to-hand transfer won\u2019t happen until sometime between months 5 and 7. It\u2019s the basis for later motions such as dressing himself, eating with utensils, holding crayons, and running. These joined discs are a Montessori classic: they help babies practice manipulating an object in one hand and eventually passing it to the other. Ideas for play: At first, your baby may grasp other things (like rings or rattles) while struggling with the discs, since holding them requires him to build up new fine motor skills.Holding the discs by month 4 is a major accomplishment for any baby\u2014don\u2019t worry if it takes some practice!4. ROLLING BELL TO ENCOURAGE ROLLING AND SCOOTING  When your baby plays with this classic Montessori rolling bell, he discovers new ways to coordinate his senses: the feel of the wood when he\u2019s grasping it, the sound it makes when you or he rolls or shakes it, and how it moves when it\u2019s rolling along. Ideas for play: Roll the bell just out of reach during tummy time to encourage him to reach and scoot.Use the bell to encourage him to roll over.Lay him on his back and place the bell just out of reach.Make the bell ring.Watch as he pulls his legs up and starts to roll over to the side where the noise just came from\u2014and eventually all the way over onto his belly.5. CLASSIC FIRST PUZZLE FOR FINE MOTOR AND PROBLEM SOLVING  The first circle puzzle helps your baby develop fine motor and problem solving skills\u2014his hands and eyes work together when he removes the puzzle piece. He\u2019s also working on shape recognition at the same time. The circle shape is the best for first learners. We love this puzzle because it is made with sustainably harvested wood and has a baby friend inside. Ideas for play: Long before your baby learns how to put the puzzle piece in, he can pull it out.Have your baby practice grasping the knob and pulling the piece out and then show him how it fits back in.Let him explore the two parts of the puzzle by mouthing them and banging them together\u2014banging objects together requires your baby to use both sides of the body at once, which is a very important skill.You can cut out and adhere pictures of family members or pets for a surprise inside.6. MONTESSORI CUP TO PROMOTE SPEECH DEVELOPMENT  Offering real world glasses, cups and pitchers to babies is a long standing Montessori tradition. Speech pathologists agree - they prefer babies to use open cups when possible, as they help babies build the muscles in the mouth that are used to form sounds (and also lessen drooling). Ideas for play: Introduce the cup to your baby once he's eating finger foods.Start with water, and model drinking from the cup for your baby.At first, your baby may just pour the water out, or drop the cup on the floor\u2014he's learning about pouring, containing, and gravity by doing this (remember that the next time he drops something messy!).Keep introducing the cup with a small amount of water at mealtimes and eventually he will begin to enjoy drinking from it.7. THE OBJECT PERMANENCE BOX - LEARNING OUT OF SIGHT DOESN'T MEAN GONE FOREVER  Between months 6 and 9, your baby can remember objects from one appearance to the next. A ball dropped inside the box is only gone for a moment\u2014which helps your baby learn that when objects can\u2019t be seen, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re necessarily gone forever. This concept is called \u2018object permanence\u2019 Ideas for play: First, show your baby how the box works by holding the ball and then dropping it through the hole.Help him try\u2014if the ball misses the hole, see if he reaches to try to get it.Resist getting the ball for him immediately\u2014he will develop his gross motor strength by reaching across his body while sitting.He\u2019s practicing grasping and releasing on purpose as he tries to drop the ball in the box (a skill he will continue to develop throughout his first year).If your baby doesn\u2019t seem interested at first, try again later\u2014 babies learn to love the box at different times.8. TREASURE BASKET FOR NEW REAL WORLD DISCOVERIES  This Montessori classic encourages your baby to explore and make new discoveries independently. Your baby craves touching, handling, and mouthing new and different things (especially objects from real life). You\u2019ll soon find out that there\u2019s an endless stream of objects inside your home and outdoors that are often more interesting to him than actual toys. Ideas for play: Place a few everyday objects in the basket.Change the objects regularly to keep the basket interesting for your baby.Think about categorizing types of objects\u2014round things, square things, fuzzy things, things that jingle\u2014to help him build associations.Feathers, rocks (large enough that she can\u2019t fit them in his mouth), pine cones, seashellsRibbons, pieces of fabric, large buttonsA baby toothbrush, a makeup brush, a clean paint brushAll sorts of balls! We especially love natural wool felt ones.Note: Be sure to watch your baby so that small or crushable items are not mouthed. Also, pay attention when babies are around objects with handles, e.g., utensils such as whisks, brushes, and wooden spoons.9. MONTESSORI EGG CUP FOR BUILDING CONCENTRATION AND COORDINATION  The wood cup and egg will help your baby learn to use both sides of his body at the same time\u2014a skill that\u2019s important for things like getting dressed. He needs lots and lots of practice using both hands at once to build the speed of communication between his brain\u2019s hemispheres. As simple as it is, the egg cup is physically fascinating to babies. Ideas for play: In the beginning, your baby will probably just enjoy banging the egg and cup together\u2014this is also a way to use both sides of the body at once!See if he can dump the egg out of the cup at first\u2014 eventually he'll work out how to put the egg in.Show your baby how to set the egg in the cup and then take it out again.Have your baby hold the egg in one hand, and the cup in the other, and encourage him to put them together.Have him try to repeat your action\u2014if he doesn\u2019t, help guide his hands while standing or sitting behind him.10. PINCER PUZZLE FOR FINE MOTOR SKILLS  Between months 10 and 12, your baby learns to grasp small objects with his thumb and index finger\u2014this is called the pincer grasp. This puzzle is designed to help him practice and reinforce this motion. Ideas for play: Once you notice your baby trying to pick up small objects with two fingers like puffs or cereal, offer him the pincer puzzle.Guide his hand and explain how to remove the wood cylinder from the block, and how to put in back in.Once he's playing with the puzzle confidently, set the block further away from the cylinder as a new challenge\u2014one that works gross and fine motor skills at the same time. 11. SLIDING TOP BOX FOR PROBLEM SOLVING AND HAND AND FINGER STRENGTH  While your baby plays with the sliding top box, he\u2019s building hand and finger strength as well as developing his hand-eye coordination. He\u2019s also working on problem solving skills\u2014figuring out how to move the lid to find the ball inside. Ideas for play: Let the ball drop into the hole, and ask your baby \u201cWhere did it go?\u201dLet him watch you slide the lid to reveal the ball.You can drop other objects in the box\u2014or put them in and slide the lid to hide them\u2014your baby will be so proud of himself when he can do this on his own!",
