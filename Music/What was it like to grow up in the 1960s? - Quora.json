            "answer_text": "I was born in the late 1940s and turned 12 in 1960. First, there were two 1960s; 1960 thru 1963/64 and then beyond. The first three years were a continuation of the 1950s, no real difference. I don\u2019t recall \u2018Duck and Cover\u2019 in the 60s, that may have been a 50s thing. Rock and Roll was in a tailspin, all we were getting was Frankie Avalon, Fabian and such. Some of the \u2018doo-wop\u2019 groups were still there but the hard rockers weren\u2019t around. Plastic was the thing, everything was covered in plastic. The new space age material. I asked my Mom once why she covered everything in vinyl. She laffed and said, it was the thing everyone was doing. There was no AC. The only place you could find AC was in a movie theatre. JFK was President and the press loved him in the way that they loved Barack Obama. For most of the press he could do no wrong, nor could Jackie or any of the Kennedys. The press had endless stories of touch football at the Kennedy compound, The Kennedy children and the Kennedy brothers. So everybody played touch football too. Viet Nam was still a distant police action; it did get press coverage but it was mostly of the Viet-Namese. American cars ruled. Automotive engineering was a different world from today. The things were fucking hugh and ran like Giant sloths. Bench seats front and rear that could fit a family of nine w/o a hitch. Gee, I loved those seats. Plus I was small enuff to ride in the shelf under the rear window. The National Highway system was copied from the Nazis and had just got under way under Eisenhower. So when you drove inter-city or inter-state it was on two lane blacktops for much or all of the way. Air travel was just beginning and people still traveled by train. Imagine telling your friends today that you\u2019re taking a train to California or New York. Air travel was a different world from today. Every passenger was treated like a prince or princess. And the staff all had Hollywood good looks. BTW, no searching or security at all. I remember (latter 60s) buying a ticket at the airport and walking on to the flight. Often we got to walk onto the tarmac to board. All the staff smiling and greeting us like we were royalty. Smoking was allowed everywhere and the booze flowed on the flights. Folks dressed to fly. It was an occasion. The only foreign cars I recall from the early 60s was the occasional VW beetle or Mercede Benz. Japanese cars are still in the future- at least on the east coast. Back on the ground, there were supermarkets (remember I\u2019m a city kid) but not as large as today. I remember we did much of our food shopping at neighborhood stores. A loaf of bread was 15 Cents, a hamburger at a local restaurant was 25 cents. A pack of cigarettes was 21 cents. And a newspaper was 4 cents. I remember some of these prices because as a kid I was often sent to a store to buy these items. My Mom would go to the A&P and buy a week or two of groceries for about $20. The groceries would be loaded into one or two big, paper bags which it was my job to carry. The big grocery chains in NY then were A&P and Bohacks. Latter there was a cute girl teenager cashier at the Bohacks who would let me buy any amount of stuff for the price of one item. How did I ever fuck that up. A pair of Clarks Desert Boots was about $5. In NYC, nobody wore blue jeans; That was farmers\u2019 clothes; That\u2019s gonna change soon. A 45 RPM record (top 10) was about 50 cents. Elvis was no longer on the charts as he had been drafted. Many young men went into the army or other military as there was still a draft of two years active duty. Fellows would volunteer for the draft to get it out of the way. But you could only volunteer for the draft in the army. There was no draft for other branches of the military. Racism was alive and very healthy. God save the poor black man that ventured into a white neighborhood. I have spoken to many black men, my age, that told me they would turn down jobs or other opportunities rather then venture into some white or ethnic areas. And the reverse was true. I remember being told not to go into certain black neighborhoods and recall being stopped once by a group of young blacks about something but nothing came of it, I was about 11 or 12. In NYC, at least, suburban flight was beginning, and every once in a while a friend or relative would move to the suburbs- never to be seen again. It was also the beginning of traffic jams. We played in the streets and parks all day and well into the night. Me? As long as I was home for dinner I was cool. It was not unusual to be out with your friends all day. Seeing your parents for the evening meal and then out again. Also, this was when extended families lived nearby so you had cousins and friends all around. Then JFK was shot and a month latter came The Beatles. LBJ was President and Viet Nam loomed ahead. Everything Changed. When JFK was shot it was a week of national mourning. Think 9/11. Everything closed, except churches. All schools, businesses, gov\u2019t offices, etc. TV was Black and white and it was 15 hours or so of news coverage of the assassination, funeral, transfer of power. BTW there was no 24 hour TV back then. Everyone was solemn, no joking around and everyone in the country assumed that everyone in Dallas was guilty to some degree. Premarital sex was still a big no man\u2019s land. As a teenager, we would dream about making-out or coping a feel. Holding a breast while while making out was heaven and you had to work for it. Weeks and months of being the BF. Finger-fucking was always beyond me. If your girl got pregnant, you got married that week. Dropped out of high school and got a job. Every year there was a couple that disappeared and folks would whisper that some girl was in \u2018trouble\u2019. Then came the Beatles and everything changed. Then Civil rights protest, and Viet Nam. Now begins the 60s people talk about. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, the 60s spanned the ages of 6-16.  I was a serious kid. I was raised to do my homework and all that good stuff. I remember looking back, that everyone looked older than they really were in the 1960s. Everyone dressed relatively formally. I don't know why I was wearing a suit in this picture, I was probably on my way to some conference or something. As I said, I was a serious kid. My nickname was \"Old Man\" for a while.  I was so serious, I actually supported Nixon in the 1960 election. I laugh hysterically at this when I think about it today.  I thought Kennedy was not serious looking enough and that Nixon was somehow better looking.Actually, in the above picture, I was probably ordered to wear a suit by my Democrat parents and write \"I am not a Republican\" 100 times longhand. Westward Migration: I moved from Ohio to California riding in the back of  Studebaker Lark VI station wagon with my sister and my bulldog, Buddy. The Studebaker Lark a brand of car that doesn't exist anymore.  Stationwagons are mostly a thing of the past too. Photo: Station Wagon Photo GalleryMy last memories of Ohio were of me shoveling snow from the sidewalk in our Columbus home.  I was age 6. Cold War: My dad worked for Lockheed in Sunnyvale, California initially, then the Lawrence Livermore Lab. Dad mentioned we would be likely targets in the event of a nuclear attack. We were well aware of the possibility of a nuclear attack. Bay of Pigs: I remember clearly laying on my back in my bedroom in Sunnyvale, CA watching every plane fly over head thinking about the possibility that Communists from Cuba were going to bomb Sunnyvale.  I took this threat seriously, as I took everything else. We did Duck and Cover drills in school, looking much like this: Photo: LOOKING BACK \u2013 Duck and Cover Space Cadet: I watched every Mercury, Gemini and Apollo launch on Black and White TV. I got a Cape Canaveral activity set for Christmas one year. I was that much into space. Photo: The transformation of the living room into a 'digital hub' I remember the day John F. Kennedy was shot.Our teachers got all serious at school, we were sent home early. Of course, we all walked home alone, because that was what we did in those days.I remember the day Martin Luther King was shot a few years later.I learned about the day Malcom X was shot when I read the autobiography of Malcolm X as a freshman in High School. I remember the day Robert F. Kennedy was shot. My dad woke me up from a dead sleep to give me the news. I watched the Beatles on Ed Sullivan, and bought my first of 100s of vinyl LP albums when the Rolling Stones released their first album, and the Beatles released Sgt. Peppers. Rock and roll was everywhere, hair got longer, and the hippies moved in ... Much to my parent chagrine.  In fifth grade my parents didn't let me watch StarTrek (because Science Fiction was a waste of time) until I convinced them that my sixth grade science teacher was really discussing the plots of StarTrek every Friday. I'm the fat one with the crewcut in the red striped shirt in this picture.  I had a major crush on my fifth-grade teacher. The guy with the cowboy hat used to give me wedgies. I was a nerd and paid the price.From age 7-17, I rode my bike, alone, across Livermore to go to swimming at a public pool located at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.  I rode this bike everywhere, in every kind of weather. My parents would have been locked up as negligent these days, given the amount of time I spent wandering alone around the Livermore Valley. Every few years, I got to tour the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. The highlight of the tour was the tour of the computer center. I fell in love with computers there.   Photos from Flickr - Photo Sharing! I rode my bike to high school, a couple of miles away, carrying my saxophone on the back tied on the baskets with bunji cords.I was a Cub Scout and Boy Scout for much of the 1960s, eventually arning the rank of Eagle. I got the atomic energy and electronics merit badges, along with about 21 others. Here I am with my scoutmaster, Mr. Rache. He was a county sheriff.  These badges prove how early I became a nerd.I built a nuclear reactor model for my Junior High Science fair. Nuclear power was a big thing in Livermore, as everyone's parents worked for either the Lawrence Livermore Lab or Sandia Laboratories.I was on a canoe trip on the Russian River in Healdsburg California the day Armstrong stepped onto the moon. I actually wore this uniform to junior high school in 1969. I would have been crucified today on social media.  One of my best friends growing up was gay. I didn't find out until I was in college. It didn't change anything between us, but by that time we rarely saw each other except at reunions. He was in Boy Scouts, but nobody really thought much about sexual orientation at the time. It was something that was whispered about here and there, but nobody would have dared to imply they were gay. Times were very different. More recently I have joined the groups that are working to remove the gay prohibition from the scouting organizations and have considered turning in my badge if things aren't changed in the near future. At school we danced to the Doors, the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Turtles, and the Monkees, Paul Revere and the Raiders, and countless other 1960s bands. TechnologyTechnology I had a rotary phoneCalculator hadn't been invented yet, so I learned to do math the hard way. And I used a slide rule. I got a massive desktop calculator as a college gift from my parents in 1973.  We didn't have a microwave, but we had SPAM, TANG, Powdered Milk, and Jello molds at every festivity.We didn't have Cable TV. It was available, but my parents refused to let us watch more than 1 hour of TV daily. We had to do other things, like ride our bikes unsupervised for hours every day, as long as we were home in time for dinner. We didn't have an air conditioner until 1968 or so, despite living in the rather hot Livermore ValleyAnd, wrapping things upAlas, as with many of us, many things changed radically in the 1970s. Here I am, getting ready to climb Half Dome in Yosemite in 1971.  Credits All photos, besides those noted as coming from other sources are from family photo albums.",
