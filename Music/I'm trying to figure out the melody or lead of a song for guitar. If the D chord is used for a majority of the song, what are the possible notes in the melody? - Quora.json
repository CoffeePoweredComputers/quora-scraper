            "answer_text": "If the song is in the key of D, then the notes of D Major Scale are D E F# G A B C# The typical chords that you would see in pop song in D would be D, E min, F# min, G, A (or A7), B min, C# dim And their 7th chord variants. And chords with suspensions, like Dsus4, A7sus4, etc. Plus chords outside the key here and there. Maybe B, E, F# major chords for example. Either way, writing melody depends on style. For any chord, at any point in the song, if you are going for a pop sort of sound, then melodies that have the root, 3rd, or 5th as sustained notes will sound fine. And using other notes to connect them. If you want jazzy sound, then melody notes that - in reference to the current chord - are the 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th (or altered version of those, like #11, b9, #9, etc) will get you more jazzy melody. That doesn\u2019t mean in jazz root, 3rd, and 5th are\u2019t used in melody, just using these other tones often enough is what makes jazz melody jazz melody (well that, and the time feel and harmony). In pop music you also use other tones beside root, 3rd, 5th. 9ths, 11ths, etc here and there. But the key is \u201chere and there\u201d. You dial in whatever spectrum you want, ranging from total poppy-ness to over the top jazz, by deciding the \u201chere and there\u201d part. And either way, no matter what notes you have for the main, sustaining melody notes, using other notes from the scale to connect your melody is what makes for interesting melody, whether connecting with 8th notes, 16th notes, etc. Think about how people sing. They don\u2019t just hold notes for one measure at a time. They are articulating, adding liveliness. So in the end, make sure you end up with melody that feels alive. ",
