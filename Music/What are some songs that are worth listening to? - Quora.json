            "answer_text": "This all depends on taste. Now, if you would like to know more about how we acquire our music taste I recommend you to read Beau Sharbrough's answer on \u201cHow does one acquire his/her music taste?\u201d. I like to listen to alot of different music genres. When I was younger I used to listen to Dutch musicians mostly. Now, I do not know if music in a foreign language is appealing to you, assuming you're not Dutch, nonetheless I will name a few. Het Is Een Nacht \u2014 Guus MeeuwisAls Sterren Aan De Hemel Staan \u2014 Frans BauerOnderweg \u2014 AbelRossane \u2014 Nick & SimonHet Land Van\u2026 \u2014 Lange Frans & Baas BWhen I hear those songs on the radio today I still enjoy them, even though I wouldn't play them myself, on a CD-player.. Or record player or Spotify (or whatever media player you prefer). My father plays guitar. I believe this heavily influenced my music taste. My father grew up in a different time, so he often plays older songs. I am proud to say that I can recognize almost all of them. There are some artist I have embraced from the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s. I'll, again, name a few: Doolin Dalton \u2014 EaglesTranscendance \u2014 SantanaTrue \u2014 Spandau Ballet(They Long To Be) Close To You \u2014 CarpentersCocaine \u2014 Eric ClaptonLast year my mother gave me a record player for my birthday. This opened a whole new door for me. I discovered so many new music. When I played the first album, Simple Dreams by Linda Ronstadt (to be honest, this whole album is worth listening to), the tears stood in my eyes. Not because the album was so sad, but because I was so happy with the gift. I wanted it for so long, and then the sound\u2026 it really is different then MP3's. Some songs I love now, that I discovered on my vinyl-journey: We're All Alone \u2014 Rita CoolidgeOn The Run \u2014 Jon GibsonIt's My Life \u2014 Bon JoviWake Up Little Susie \u2014 The Everly BrothersPeacemaker \u2014 Kool & The GangI really recomand listening to all of them, so you can create your own music taste. Now, offcourse there are some other songs worth while mentioning. Here are random songs that are worthwhile to listen to: The Lion \u2014 James Bell X Bitch \u2014 Meredith BrooksDansa (Don't Quit Dancing) \u2014 Massada Can't Get Enough \u2014 Bad CompanyDer Kommissar \u2014 FalcoDrink A Beer \u2014 Luke BryanKein Liebeslied \u2014 KraftklubVivir Mi Vida \u2014 Marc AnthonyCorona \u2014 Louderdales Infinity \u2014 Guru Josh Project For now, enjoy. But remember there is more amazing music out there. This little list isn't everything. ",
