            "answer_text": "Just go through the pantheon of classic rock, and you won\u2019t get very far without running into some covers- many of which are gonna be from the blues realm and from early rock and roll. The Beatles did Little Richard and Chuck Berry covers, among others. The Doors did tons of blues covers, and famously covered Brecht/Weil\u2019s \u201cAlabama Song\u201d, and even did some jazz stuff in the early days. The Grateful Dead did dozens of blues, folk and Chuck Berry covers. Jimi Hendrix did Bob Dylan covers, among many blues and rock covers. We could be here forever discussing Led Zeppelin\u2019s covers and interpolations of famous blues riffs (polite way to say stealing, haha!) into their songs. The repertoires of Joe Cocker, Janis Joplin, Jeff Beck, Clapton, and especially The Rolling Stones are chock-full of fantastic covers. Really, anybody who came into prominence in the 60s and 70s almost certainly did covers from the genres that directly influenced it. Sometimes even the covers became more popular than the original- \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d is Bob Dylan, but we all know Hendrix\u2019s version more familiarly, I\u2019d reckon. Now, are there artists famous for doing covers exclusively? Yes, but not a whole many. There is definitely something to be said for originality, but when you start out you gotta play covers so people will listen. Some people keep running with it, take Three Dog Night for example- almost entirely a cover band that gave songwriters like Hoyt Axton, Laura Nyro, Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson some early exposure. Sha Na Na does all doo-wop covers. Dark Star Orchestra is all about keeping the Grateful Dead experience alive. Some groups are cover bands that cover artists in the style of other genres- take Dread Zeppelin for instance doing the Zep songbook in reggae. Even though he\u2019s a parody guy we could even loop Weird Al into the mix as a cover artist, though song parodies take creative licenses in their own ways for humorous effect. I think most popular artists do covers of songs they enjoy, and covers of popular songs, but it\u2019s harder to find really popular cover bands on a national level. Many regions and neighborhoods have popular cover bands, or in a similar vein tribute acts- where not just the songs, but the entire aesthetic is adopted. Back in the older days, songwriters would write songs for particular artists to do. People up in the Brill Building and Tin Pan Alley would write up catchy pop tunes and shop it around to different artists until somebody took interest and recorded it. Think of singers like Sinatra, Frankie Valli, people in that vein. They seldom wrote their own songs, but they have definitive versions of those songwriter\u2019s compositions. Is that covering? In a sense, yes, but is it truly a cover if you\u2019re the first person to perform it? Not exactly. In the jazz world, so much of the culture is based on knowing the standards- songs that literally everybody covers. Much of an artist\u2019s creative and improvisational acumen is weighed against how they interpret a standard. Covering is almost a requirement, to show respect for the elders that came before you and to show how you like to play their songs. Many people cover old tunes in modern ways, some choose to kick it old school. Jazz is all about being original, but when people are trying to appraise your skills, it\u2019s difficult to really do so on an original composition because they have nothing to compare it to. All the jazz greats did covers, everybody contemporary and up-and-coming today cover many of those same tunes the greats did. It\u2019s even more so in the classical music world. Rarely do you go to a piano recital to hear original contemporary classical compositions- as cool as they are. You go to see Lang Lang or someone like that for their interpretations of Chopin, Mozart, et. al. That\u2019s also interesting, because where jazz covers involve improvisation and the performer\u2019s own musical interpretations of the work, classical interpretations are almost entirely based on feel- tempo, dynamics, etc. Other than some Mozart pieces, there\u2019s very little ad-libbing and improv in classical to my understanding, so to have a truly signature reading of a piece takes a very serious emotional investment and deep focus. But yeah, covers are a hugely ubiquitous phenomenon in all styles of music- people like to hear, and musicians like to play what they know they like. And playing covers influences and begets original pieces as well, so it\u2019s all part of the process! ",

            "answer_text": "Johnny Cash has been suggested by a few, so I'll contribute Ryan Adams. He does a huuge amount of covers and famously released a reworked version of Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 album, covering each song in his own country style. It's a great album and even made me go and listen to some of the original (never thought I'd admit to liking a Taylor Swift song but blank spaces is really great). Ryan Adams - Blank Space (The Daily Show) In the mid.00s he also threw out an album of orignal songs that covered popular indie rock stylings of the past 20 years. It's called rock and roll and each song covers the sound of a popular band/sound such as the 80s vibe of the smiths, the lowfi indie of the strokes, standard rock of oasis etc. Kind of an interesting take on covers. Apparently he did that in a couple of weeks over a dispute with his label. Some of the songs are really good though. He also does a lot of covers when playing live, including having fun with the crowd and throwing in Bryan Adams songs: \u201cthis ones for the people who got tricked into thinking they were coming to a Bryan Adams gig\u201d. Two of my favourites are Manic Street Preachers who do a lot if covers as Bsides and play covers live at virtually every gig (eg. Randrops keep falling on my head, umbrella) and the clash (police and thieves). Shout out to bob dylan for probably being the most covered artist of all time. ",
