            "answer_text": "Now, I\u2019m just answering this because reading the other answers, I thought everybody was a little too hyped up. Let\u2019s take a step back and relax. To answer your question well, I\u2019ll take it slow. First, you used the word \u201cartist\u201d, in your question. As the other answers show, that word is quite a dangerous one to toss. I personnally think, regarding any artist in general and not just Jennie, that the word \u201cartist\u201d can mean MANY things. Basically, its all about what you define as an \u201cartist\u201d. If you think that singing and dancing well, as well as expressing feelings and thoughts through artistical work (that might not be your own) is enough to be called an artist, then yes, Jennie definetly fits this category (and you can add in it all asian idols, too). I\u2019m not expressing an opinion here, just making things clear. Now, to answer while regarding Jennie of BP as an artist, my answer would be: \u201cwhat do you mean by BIG?\u201d. In terms of popularity, she isn\u2019t. -(we all know that trophy would fall in the likes of PSY, BTS, EXO or Big Bang\u2019s lap)- In terms of artistical ability\u2026 She isn\u2019t either, or isn\u2019t yet: I mean, she sings well, dances well, looks good... But then again, so do thousands of other people. In terms of uniqueness or musicality, she doesn\u2019t, at the moment, qualify either. So\u2026 In short, she\u2019s not the GREATEST KPOP ARTIST EVER, in most opinions. However, she probably is in the eyes of some of her fans, so we can safely say that this question cannot be perfectly answered, either. All the same, she still deserves credit for what she does, and her standing right now on the international entertainment scene. I see a lot of hate going on against BP, and I feel as if their \u201clack of hardwork\u201d is overrated. Lots of love from a BTS Army! ",

            "answer_text": "No, and no. She is a rapper, an avarege one not a top. She is not a singer. She dresses nicely. She is not an artist and of course not of the biggest anything. I am not trying to put her down but it is the truth. There is a BIG difference between being an artist and let\u2019s say\u2026being an idol. Some idols may be artist but not every idol is an artist. She is an avarege idol. Her rap is not that amazing. Her singning is nothing, we should not judge actuallly because she did not sing. Her dancing is kinda okay. That is Jenni, and it is not bad. Being an artist mainy relates to creating. You cheography a dance, not just practise and doing it, then you make art. You write songs, good deep songs, you make art. You sing as nothing else in the world matter, than even when you sing the same song forever you still bring out emotions of people, you make art. I don't have an actual definition of the word artist but I believe it is one who is unique, distinguished, creative, and Jennie is not. ",
