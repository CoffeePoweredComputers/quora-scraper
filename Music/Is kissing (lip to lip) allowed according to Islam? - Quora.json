            "answer_text": "If you are asking about a Muslim man and his wife kissing after marriage within their privacy, their religion has nothing to do with them kissing each other on lips. If they feel comfortable kissing each other on the lips, their religion doesn\u2019t prohibit it. But if it\u2019s for any other reason like unmarried Muslim couple kissing, or same-sex Muslim people kissing or even traditional (heterosexual) married couple kissing but not in private, well it would just depend on where and how they grew up. In this case, the religion will have an impact but a greater impact will be the environment (conservative or liberal) within which they grew up in. ",

There are specific ritualistic movements and prayers that are said. Charity or alms-giving (Zakat) - Each year a Muslim should give money to charity (Usually 2.5% of their savings). If a person does not have much money, they can do other things instead. Fasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm) A pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) - Muslims should go to Mecca on a pilgrimage. They should do this at least once in their lives. A person does not have to make this pilgrimage if they cannot afford to, or they are physically unable to (Though they can get someone else to go on their behalf). ",
