            "answer_text": " In one way or another, it\u2019s about desensitization. It uses the sexual act of \u201cfisting\u201d as a metaphor (\u201cturn around and take my hand\u201d\u2026 \u201cfinger/elbow/shoulder deep in the borderline\u201d\u2026 \u201cthis may hurt a little but it\u2019s something you\u2019ll get used to\u201d\u2026 etc.). But Tool\u2019s lead singer, Maynard James Keenan, has historically been known for his scathing commentary and critiques on society\u2026 not one-dimensional, perverse shock-lyrics. So the sexual theme here is almost definitely a metaphor. That metaphor, to me, is desensitization: the protagonist, or humans in general, are constantly searching for more\u2026 never satisfied and always pushing the envelope. This desensitization could also be linked to something more specific. It could be how people seek stronger drugs, wilder sex, and crazier adrenaline rushes just to feel anything at all after a while. It could also be a metaphor for drug addiction, detailing how it gets worse and worse and \u201cscrews you\u201d even more over time. Then again, it may also be how media desensitizes us to violence. One way or another\u2026 I know MJK is NOT simply writing a song about fisting. There\u2019s symbolism there, somehow tying into desensitization or destructive progression of drugs or desire. Tool is a great band, and MJK is a talented lyricist/songwriter.  ",

            "answer_text": "The Tool song Stinkfist is a metaphor, based on buttsecs of course. Specifically using the hand, hence the title. In the song, the lyrics say \"Desensitized to everythingWhat became of subtlety?\" The metaphor is our own lack of satisfaction when we get what we want. We always want more. The metaphor starts in the verse \"Finger deep within the borderline\" Tool is saying at first a finger is good enough. By the last verse, it's an elbow within the borderline. EDIT: I was trying to be subtle. It's about fisting, dude. ",
