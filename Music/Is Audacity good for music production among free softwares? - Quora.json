            "answer_text": "In a word, no. If you have a music track, a narration track, and some sound effects that you want to turn into a mixed soundtrack, by all means use Audacity. That is what it is designed for. If you want to actually produce a music track that someone would think is good enough to use in their soundtrack (and might mix into it using Audacity) then you need a Multitrack Digital Audio Workstation. What musicians refer to as a DAW. The differences are too numerous to list. Most importantly, When you add an effect in Audacity, it\u2019s embedded into the audio permanently, and then you can listen to it. If you don\u2019t like it, you can use \u201cUNDO\u201d and adjust the settings but once you decide its OK and add a second effect, you can\u2019t leave the second effect on there and change the first. You have to undo the lot and start again. If you get it right, it\u2019s pure LUCK that you did everything in the right order and to the right level. In a full DAW effects process the sound as you listen to it. That means you can add some delay, and reverb, then add compression, then adjust the EQ, then change hte reverb, then take off some EQ, then increase the delay volume or change the repeat time, then take the compression out again\u2026 and that\u2019s what you need to be able to do to get professional results. Experiment until perfection arrives. Don\u2019t use Audacity to create new music. It\u2019s like using a chainsaw to chop vegetables. Messy, inaccurate, and any good results arrive by pure chance after a lot more failed attempts. ",
