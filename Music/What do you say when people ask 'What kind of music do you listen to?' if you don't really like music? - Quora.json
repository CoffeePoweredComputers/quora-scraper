It\u2019s not my thing, so honestly I have no opinion on it.\u201d \u2026.or you could invent some big fantastic lie about childhood trauma that resulted in the inability to hear differences in tone, making all sounds equal, and therefore all music is lost on you anyway because all you can hear is rhythm and volume changes, and you could then expand upon how sad it makes because your mother(God rest her soul) used to sing you this specific nursery rhyme, and now you can\u2019t even imagine it anymore(\u201c\u2026it\u2019s gone, right there on the edge of memory, where I can almost reach out and touch it, but gone, gone I tell you, gone!\u201d), and late at night when you can\u2019t sleep, and you\u2019re alone with the crickets and ticking of the clock, the reminder of this tortures your soul, and it is then that the tears come, and you know the breakdown is upon you, but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it\u2026. \u2026yeah, just stick to being honest, seems far more simple in the long run.
