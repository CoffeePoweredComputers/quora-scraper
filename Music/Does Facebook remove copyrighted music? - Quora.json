            "answer_text": "If you post cocpyrighted music on FB, or any social site, the protocols are as follows: The copyright holder has to find your infringhement and report it. Some sites will contaxt you to ask if you wish to dispute the claim\u2014others will just pull your submission outright. The big copyright licensing people use bots to roam sites like YouTube to find infringement sso they can kill them. On FB, the likelihood they\u2019d find your music is smaller since they\u2019d have to have access to all your stuff-so if your privacy settings are not \u201cpublic\u201d they\u2019ll not see them. Also, if you\u2019re using a link to, say, YouTube, then they\u2019ll just have to go complain to YouTube and that will kill your link. The odds you\u2019ll receive any legal action as nil. ",
