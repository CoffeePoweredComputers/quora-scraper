            "answer_text": "\u201cEleanor Rigby was Paul\u2019s BABY; I helped with the Education of the Child\u201d. [ Music by The Beatles, Sarcasm by, well, you know\u2026]. Eleanor Rigby is my favourite song off the Avant Guard MeisterWerke \u2018Revolver\u2019because it was so utterly unexpected & \u2018Anti-Rock\u2019. After hearing Eleanor Rigby, for the first time, I exclaimed: \u201cThis is not Rock, this is\u2026the FUTURE!!! Paul, (John & George) sang backup. Think about it? It\u2019s a pulsing song propelled by nothing but angular staccato strings\u2014its Jimi Hendrex\u2019s \u2018Purple Haze\u2019 for the high brow Vivaldi set\u2026 Why is Eleanor Rigby \u2018Anti-Rock\u2019? First, it\u2019s not a Love Song by any stretch of the imagination. Who but The Beatles would DARE write a song about the marginalization & Loneliness of Britain\u2019s Elderly, in 1966, and get away with it? \u201cDave (Clark), I give it a 1, you really can\u2019t dance to it and it\u2019s so depressing\u2026\u201d Second, there is not a single Rock Instrument played on the track yet you can still stage dive & head walk to it!!! FYI, I always hated the gimmicky Revolver version; you want the 2015 remix off of ONE. Fifth Beatle George Martin scored the piece for an OCTET as influenced by Bernard Hermann. Maverick Recording Engineer Geoff Emerick wanted the song to be the opposite of \u2018Yesterday\u2019 so he went for close miking of their instruments which, in 1966, wasn\u2019t done \u2705. How did the Octet react? In unison, they slid their chairs \ud83e\ude91 back\u2014which caused an exasperated George Martin to scream \u201cSTOP MOVING THE CHAIRS\u201d!!! The Octet recorded the song 28APR1966 and the song is as beloved & exciting to hear 54 years later. The Sixties were the height of Rock with the 80\u2019s it\u2019s Swan Song. It is said that Chuck Berry died of a broken heart when His love child (Rock) died in Y2K after a long illness. R.I.P. Rocky Road, or is it Rock & Roll? Or is it Rock Island Line, the 60\u2019s were such a blur to me\u2026 Martin\u2019s OCTET: Tony Gilbert, \ud83c\udfbb violinist, Sidney Sax, Violinist , John Sharpe, Violinist & Juergen Hess, Violinist Stephen Shingles, Viola, John Underwood, Viola Derek Simpson, Celloist, Stephen Landberry, Celloist.
