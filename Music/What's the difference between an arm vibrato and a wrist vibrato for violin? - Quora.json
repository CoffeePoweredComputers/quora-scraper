            "answer_text": "Vibrato is a complicated subject. There are books devoted solely to the subject. That said, I\u2019ll offer a general response. Simply put, arm vibrato uses the left arm as the mechanism to generate vibrato. Wrist vibrato uses the \u201cwrist\u201d as the mechanism to accomplish this. That said, I should add that \u201cthe use of the wrist and the arm while producing vibrato should be treated as a consequence of the finger activity\u201d [1]. One could argue that they each have their pros and cons, but in reality, the best vibrato - in my opinion - consists of a combination of the two, and depending on the musical context, I may lean towards one type of vibrato over the other. Nevertheless, the wrist and arm work in unison, as a result of the impulse generated by the first joint of the finger. This is my view, and training, which argues that it helps to avoid unnecessary tension (but I won\u2019t open that can of worms and debate that here.) The best musicians do not use one hard-fast form of vibrato. They apply whichever they believe the musical context demands. Sometimes it\u2019s fast and narrow. Other times, it may be slow and wide. Sometimes you want the very tip of the finger, sometimes you want the fattest part of the finger. Sometimes you want just a hint of vibrato, which could be slow and narrow, or fast and narrow. It all depends. Nevertheless, the general answer is that arm vibrato uses the arm to generate vibrato, whereas wrist vibrato uses the hand to generate vibrato.

            "answer_text": "There are three different parts of your hand that move when you vibrate - an arm, a wrist and a finger. A skillful violinist should be able to separate these parts to fit the desirable vibration style. An arm vibrato is when you move your arm with wrist and fingers loose. You can image a tree waving with the wind - movement of the arm is causing wrist and fingers movement. A wrist vibrato doesn\u2019t need the arm movement - you just wave your wrist like you\u2019re waving goodbye (sideways, not up and down). This is a little bit harder, because it requires separation - wrist can\u2019t be stiff, but fingers must hold on to fingerboard quite tightly. Since adding a wrist movement can be very beneficial for developing variety of vibration speed and ambitus, I would recommend practicing it in a slow manner, preferably in third position. Separate the wrist, don\u2019t move the arm and wave the sound slowly up and down, by a semitone or so. If you start feeling comfortable with it, you can start speeding up. ",
