            "answer_text": "Indian classical music system does not recognize PhD as any degree. Rather, they have Visharad, then Nipun followed by Aacharya as qualifying degrees. If one wishes to do a PhD in music instead, he/she has to take admission in a college/university that offers B.A. in music or, B.Music, and then follow it with M.Music and then a PhD just like any regular candidate of any other course. Noteworthy here is that, Visharad, Nipun or Acharya are not recognised as valid degrees in most universities. ",
