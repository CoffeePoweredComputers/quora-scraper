            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Music is not a commodity. Let's just get that straight. At least not to the fans anyway. Otherwise, ticket sales and merch would be the same prices across all acts. So an unsigned act that no one has heard of would charge as much to go see as an established act everyone has heard of. Us fans are willing to pay more on our favorite artists, which is basically the reason Justin Bieber has his own nail polish and perfume line. Business, on the other hand, particularly tech companies have disrupted music sales by pretty much making all singles the same price and all albums the same price. This wasn't always like this.  Before iTunes, a big single from say Jay Z would be $3.99, while a single from a lessor known act would be $.99. Can you imagine that? To a non Jay Z fan that seems kind of unfair. Keep in mind you were still getting a physical product, a cd, so labels could get away with this. What iTunes did, as you pointed out, is comidify the music buying experience making it more fair to the fans and less fair to the labels/artists. They could do this because after Napster, the internet commidified music making its cost to distrubute $0.00. Labels were scared. Scared enough to sell their music for $.99 a song while Apple takes a 30% cut. Now that digital songs, these bits and bytes of 0's and 1's had a \"fairer price\", streaming service could price their payouts accordingly. Though it still isn't exactly transparent how much streaming services such as Spotify are paying labels/artists. As an interesting aside... while iTunes did stabilize music pricing, the unintended consequence was ever increasing concert ticket sales. Perhaps some company could fix this? ",
