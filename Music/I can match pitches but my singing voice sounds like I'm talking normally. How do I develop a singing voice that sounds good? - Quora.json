            "answer_text": "Two ideas. First, listen to an opera singer and try to mimic it. Experiment with different mouth and throat positions until it sounds similar. Repeat with broadway style, then pop, then \u201ctalking\u201d like you do now. Feel the difference. Second, if you can\u2019t quite get the opera or broadway sound, try a \u201cbreathing tube\u201d or a short piece of PVC pipe about half to 3/4 inch in diameter. The way this works is you just shove it down your throat (make sure it\u2019s not too short so you can get it back out). The goal is to move your throat out of its way so that it doesn\u2019t touch your throat. If you fail, you\u2019ll gag. No harm, just a bit uncomfortable. The exercise of widening your throat and moving it out of the way will strengthen the muscles used to create powerful singing. Once you get the position, the rest is from the belly. The top of the throat stays open and the pitch is created at the bottom in the space between the two clefts of your collar bone. One thing I\u2019ve learned by singing like this is that it takes much more strength and control in the throat just to create the right shape than most people realize. If you\u2019re doing it right, you\u2019ll start to fatigue in about 10 seconds. And a 2 minute song is surprisingly hard until you get those muscles in shape. ",

            "answer_text": "Having a singing voice that sounds like your speaking voice isn't necessarily a bad thing. Barbershop-style singing actually encourages this to some extent. You have more experience speaking than you do singing. Most people know better, even if subconsciously, how to make themselves heard while speaking than while singing. If your singing voice truly sounds like your speaking voice, you've figured out how to incorporate your natural resonance in your singing. This is one of the goals of vocal instruction in barbershop: incorporating one's natural resonance into one's singing. Try barbershop! If you have truly incorporated your speaking resonance into your singing voice, they will gladly accept that and help you improve other aspects of singing. ",
