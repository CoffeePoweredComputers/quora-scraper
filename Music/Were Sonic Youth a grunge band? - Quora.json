            "answer_text": "No, Sonic Youth were recording almost 10 years before Grunge emerged. Their brand of Rock was influential on Grunge acts and indeed Nirvana supported them on the 1991 tour just before they became well known but they are of an earlier era and not Grunge. There certainly was some mutual admiration between the older Sonic Youth and the younger more grunge orientated acts, they released a split single for instance with Grunge pioneers Mudhoney. But Mudhoney never played guitar in Glenn Branca\u2019s avant garde orchestras unlike Thurston Moore & Lee Ranaldo. Sonic Youth emerged at the tail end of the No Wave scene in NYC and are a punk influenced band. They played alongside hard-core bands, recorded for a hard-core label SST but provided a noise rock template for many of the more adventurous punk and post punk influenced bands to move beyond hard-core, Dinosaur Jnr & Husker D\u00fc being two of many.  Death Valley 69 with No Wave stalwart Lydia Lunch I wouldn't get hung up on the Noise Rock, description of Sonic Youth who draw upon a wide range of seminal bands from proto punk stalwarts like the Velvet Underground, Stooges and the Modern Lovers, the finest 70s punk acts like Television, Patti Smith, the Ramones, Black Flag & the Voidoids, cult acts like the Fall, the Swell Maps, John Fahey, Jazz acts like Derek Bailey, John Zorn, Beefheart and Sun Ra and the obscure Crime, Jack Ruby. They have a much wider palette of musical influences than most genres of Rock music, never mind other rock acts. While l have a soft spot for Bad Moon Rising, their reputation is built on the twin guitar attack of the three 80s albums that followed EVOL, Sister and Daydream Nation. And unlike many alternative rock acts that sign to a major label their quality output continued into the 90s when they signed with DGC. Nirvana also took Sonic Youth\u2019s advice and signed to Geffen and Sonic Youth did show some Grunge influence on some of their earlier DGC albums.  Teenage Riot They also influenced many alternative rock acts that followed in their wake, there are few of the challenging late 20th Century alt-rock acts that aren't influenced by this band PJ Harvey, Nirvana, Pavement, God Speed You Black Emperor, Mogwai, Slint, Tortoise, Sleater Kinney, My Bloody Valentine, Tortoise, Sigur Ros and a truckload more. Sonic Youth are not a \u201cgrunge act\u201d they are a singularly unique 80/90s American alternate rock phenomena and could almost be a sub genre of rock in their own right. Influence wise they are the anti-U2, if Black Sabbath & Neil Young are the fathers of Grunge, Sonic Youth were Grunge\u2019s big brother and opened rock to a range of alternative directions beyond that of the heritage and more mainstream acts.

            "answer_text": "no. dirty is the closest they ever came to grunge, and even then it doesn\u2019t sound like nirvana ever did. sy weren\u2019t super into teen angst and didn\u2019t cater to that demographic for the most part. art rock is really the only thing i can really describe the youth as. hold on\u2026 so the internet describes grunge as: a style of rock music characterized by a raucous guitar sound and lazy vocal delivery. but i\u2019d say this is incorrect. kurt cobain\u2019s voice was not lazy. FUCK sonic youth are not grunge. they\u2019re noisy but not raucous. there\u2019s a big difference if you have the time and/or care, take a listen to dirty (1992 album by sonic youth and their closest flirtation with grunge) and then sister (1987 album which i\u2019d say encapsulates sonic youth) and then tell me if they\u2019re grunge ",
