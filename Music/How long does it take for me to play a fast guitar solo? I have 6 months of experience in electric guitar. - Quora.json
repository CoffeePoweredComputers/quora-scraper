            "answer_text": "Well to play fast you need to play slow. First of all, if this is just you wanting to improvise a solo and you want to do it quickly, ensure you are familiar with numerous techniques that you can actually change around and use to your advantage. What makes a unique fast solo, is what you decide to use. It\u2019s really a question of \u201cwhat does it take to play a fast guitar solo?\u201d Also, factor in that you need the equipment. The best example is being like, having a JEM-7V and only having a little \u00a350 fender amplifier that really doesn\u2019t sustain at all. Good luck playing fast on there. Additionally you could always opt for an effects processor and a cheap amp so you can get those tones (it won\u2019t be the same as getting the real deal though - it won\u2019t sound as natural. If it\u2019s learning an existing one, I\u2019ll direct you over to Kiko Loureiro. He has a \u201cguitar techniques\u201d page where for a small fee, you can access some things. Some stuff is free, but when I looked, he had some really good stuff for learning, including techniques and exactly HOW to practice. He advertises it on Instagram every so often. (i am not affiliated with kiko in any way, i find his stuff useful, and so recommend it.) So really, it\u2019s down to your dedication, and choice on what to learn. ",

            "answer_text": "The honest answer is it will take as long as the time you put in practicing. You also have to accept that some people are naturally gifted and will learn quicker. Someone will always appear better than you (in your mind) Pick a piece of music and play it slowly then speed up. Take your time. If speed is your thing go on youtube and look for someone like Steve Stine who is a phenomenal player. Look for teachers who are graded to teach electric guitar level 8 if possible. They will teach you the correct technique. Or just put your favorite records on and learn em the hard way by ear, that\u2019s how I did it and I have been playing for over 50 years and learning everyday. Enjoy the journey ",
