            "answer_text": "Apparently, it does. 90% of the time I don\u2019t remember my dreams which is a good thing cause I guess I mainly have nightmares anyway. Yesterday I played music for my hair to grow overnight while I sleep. Before we start I think you\u2019ll should know I have this irrational fear of keeping the doors locked in my house cause that sure keeps burgers out.(sarcasm) I just have to have the doors locked or this happens. In the dream, I wake up to someone banging on the door. I go to look and I see this head of pink just jumping up and down banging on my door. It\u2019s legit a monster trying to break into my house. Of course, that's how all my break and entry dreams are. Lots of monsters crowd around the three doors to my house and as they bang on it and just go crazy the locks slowly slide open. I'm always terrified of what might happen if they manage to unlock the car. If you die in a dream would you die in real life? To me, it\u2019s so scary and it felt like I spent hours holding the door lock in place trying to ignore the pink monsters increasing banging on the door. I'm actually crying just typing this out. I don\u2019t know why I'm so scared of that but I am. It\u2019s not always a house either. I might wake up in a car to a monster, always a monster, trying to pull the door open. Or like in Percy Jackson where monsters can smell out demigods? yeah, like that. They always follow me and the one thing keeping me away from them is a door with a lock. I\u2019m still researching what a monster could symbolize in a dream. 2 years seems like more than enough to get over this. Lesson learned though, no music while sleep. It really is just setting you up to remember your worst nightmare. ",

            "answer_text": " Sleep researchers have found evidence that music can improve your sleep for people of all ages. It\u2019s not just babies who love to listen to lullabies as they drift off to sleep. Relaxing to music can even be helpful for those with sleep disorders yet there is still much to be learned about how exactly music affects you during your sleep. Listed below are some interesting insights that not all humans are the same. For example: Music is frequently used as a pleasant way to wind down before going to sleep. People vary widely in the types of music they fall asleep too.An online survey was conducted where there were more than 600 different people who participated. Three in five people said they never used music to help them get to sleep. Many of these people were the younger age group who we would think we more than likely by the ones listening to music more.During this survey, people clearly had their own ideas about the best music to fall asleep too, including 14 different musical genres and 545 artists.It is likely however, that calming types of music would be particularly good for eliciting certain sleep benefits.A study presented at the European Society of Cardiology found that Yogo music at bedtime may improve your heart rate variability. Although nothing is proven, listening to meditative music before going to sleep can impact your cardiovascular health in a meaningful way.Not only can listening to music before sleep improve health and the quality of your sleep but also the ability to enter your dreams. Dream that include music tend to be emotionally positive.To sum up, researchers say that their findings support the hypothesis that content of dreams is largely a continuation of a person\u2019s thoughts and concerns in waking life. Therefore, if you are the type of person that spends a lot of waking time singing, playing an instrument or actively listening to music etc your likelihood of having a dream including music is higher. So to answer your question, YES I believe that listening to music before you sleep can help prevent your dreaming turning into a nitemare. ",
