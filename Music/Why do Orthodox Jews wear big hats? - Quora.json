            "answer_text": "Not all of us do. Sometimes I wear a baseball hat with one of my favorite National Parks, or something like a Stetson Cruiser or a Santa Fe. There\u2019s no regulations about this- it\u2019s cultural. I spent a significant amount of time in the U.S. west and my family is from Eastern KY. I went to an orthodox synagogue* one time with a friend to Louisville, KY. (The \u201cbig City\u201d in eastern KY.) He was from N.Y. and Florida. He was sure I had the wrong address. He asked if there were Jews here. A man answered, well, \u201cI am , but I\u2019m not sure you are.\u201d He was in overalls and a hat. It is cultural and is dictated by local norms. An excellent Book is \u201cCoalField Jews: An Appalachian History\u201d by Deborah Weiner.",

            "answer_text": "Our dress is traditional and identifies us with particular subgroups within Orthodox Jewry. A careful observer can tell a lot about a person by the type of hat they wear and how they wear it. The shape of the brim, whether it is bent down or up, as well as the style help us to dress as our peers do (much like every other society on earth) ",
