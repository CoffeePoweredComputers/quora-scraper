            "answer_text": "Hello!!! Yes you can, go for it!!! Lisa from Blackpink was the first foreign trainee and idol at YG entertainment. She said when she first came to South Korea all by herself, she didn't know any word other than \u201cAnnyeonghaseyo\" which means \u201chello\". Now she is fluent in the language. Other trainees and staff weren't allowed to speak to her in any other language other than Korean. Lisa said this maybe one of the reasons she learned so quickly. Lisa trained for 5 years so I think YG made sure she was fluent in Korean since she was the first foreigner there. You will have to work hard, but in the end it is worth it. It's better to make sure that you know basic Korean so that you can communicate with your fellow trainees and instructors. I hope you got your answer, Have a great day, Lumiere belle ",

            "answer_text": " Theoretically not. Most big entertainment companies in Korea are open and if you get selected as a trainee, it is most likely that you\u2019ll have to follow courses to learn Korean. Many idols became trainee without speaking Korean, such as recently Sorn (CLC), or Prince Henry Mak talking[1] about his past experience: \u201cI'm the alien here,\" says Mak. \"Sometimes they joke around and I don't understand.\u201d And anyway, whatever your dream is, don\u2019t stop at the first barrier, just do it!

If you do get into the company they will teach you Korean and if you are a minor they will teach you academic lessons like math, history, etc. I hope this helps you out. ",
