Anyone who thinks Billie isn\u2019t the beautiful queen she is just back off. The thing is you see all these fake people and say oh she\u2019s pretty, but guess what those are people are fake. Billie is herself and doesn\u2019t care what you think about her and if she\u2019s cute or not. Noo she\u2019s just naturally beautiful and doesn\u2019t try to flaunt it.   If you still don\u2019t think she\u2019s pretty I just don\u2019t even know what to say. ",
