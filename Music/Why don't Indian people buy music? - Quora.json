            "answer_text": "We bargain for 5 bucks  with the vegetable vendor for potatoes.We go to supermarkets with our own carry bags just because they charge for carry bags now. We prefer body deodorants over perfumes even though we know the deos don't provide all that freshness and aren't even long lasting/strong like perfumes, just becuase they are wayy cheaper. We made chappal a fashion because nike was too cool (and too expensive too).Ever wondered why Linc gel pens were a huge hit? Yes. They cost 5 rupees and wrote like an Add gel pen.We sell raddi (trash) and those 80 bucks. Happiness had a measure. We don't spend money on cleaning appliances. The long kurta I had discarded years ago is now shredded and used as a cleaning cloth.  \"But a song costs a maximum of \u20b915?! Aren't you hypocrites?\"is your counter argument, right? Yes, we are. We only bought audio casettes before because there wasn't any other way out. Even then those twin casette recorders came as a boon.  We would buy Nestl\u00e9 Alpino and Cadbury Dairy Milk Silk for my child but for songs? No way. Hell if somebody would've offered Chocolates for free, would you have declined and asked him to put a price tag to it? Of course, the Music Industry is at huge losses. By huge, i meant very huge. But who cares? Long story short, we just don't think something like Music could be a commodity. Piracy Zindabad. (Hail Piracy). PS: I purchase songs. At iTunes. My friends call me an elitist. </sarcasm>But I do get these pangs when I can torrent the whole album of Mtv Unplugged at 320 kbps quality put up at iTunes at a price of \u20b9110 per album. But then, what about the sound engineer who worked so hard, what about the music director..well.. They should be paid the due. Music directors and artists are paid separately. But the sound artists at the recording co. aren't. ",
