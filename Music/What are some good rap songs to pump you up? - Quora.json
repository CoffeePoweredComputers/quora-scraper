            "answer_text": "Ok these will all be from one artist, (sorry) but they are great songs, which are lyrical and hype. Yes it is Denzel Curry, and he is getting sleeped on hard. Here are some good hype songs, Sumo, Percs, Equalizer, Ult, G**k, Ultimate, and Hate Government. Remember although these are hype songs this doesn\u2019t mean they are not lyrical a particular reason I love Denzel. also let me give a shoutout to a up and comer BBno$ although not as lyrical as Denzel he makes great hype music. Who Dat Boi, Lit like a Candle, Run it up, Ferrari Fitness. **** The whole imperial album is very good and I would recommend **** ",
