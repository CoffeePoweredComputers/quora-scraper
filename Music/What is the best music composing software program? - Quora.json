            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The other answers I see here focus on notation software, but I wasn\u2019t immediately sure if that was what you meant by the question. If that IS what you meant, there are already some good suggestions here, to which I\u2019d add Sibelius as a suggestion purely because that\u2019s what I use (predominantly because it\u2019s made by Avid, who make Pro Tools, which I also use, and the two integrate seamlessly with one another). To add a different perspective (the one I assumed you were angling for before reading the other answers), I\u2019ll discuss the use of DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) for songwriting. The vast majority of commercial/professional songwriters today tend to record/produce songs as they write them, either with the assistance of a dedicated engineer/producer or by themselves if they have engineering chops themselves. Working this way allows songwriters to experiment with various elements including instrumentation/arrangement, structure, melody, harmony and lyrics extremely effectively; capturing ideas as they go with the ability to easily edit, chop and change things around if they so desire. There are three programs/DAWs in particular that dominate the field for this kind of application. These are: Pro ToolsLogic ProAbleton LiveIn all honesty, no one of these programs is objectively \u201cthe best\u201d: they all have strengths and weaknesses for certain applications but essentially all do the same thing, and a competent user will be able to produce professional results with any one of them. The program you prefer ultimately comes down to personal preference in consideration of factors like workflow, UI (user interface) and certain features depending on the type of music you are producing. Traditionally, Pro Tools has been viewed as the \u201cindustry standard\u201d but in my experience this situation is rapidly changing, with more and more writers opting for Logic or Ableton instead. Pro Tools is phenomenal for working with recorded audio and in my opinion is still the optimal choice for editing and mixing. At the writing stage, however, these are not necessarily key considerations for many people. It is also fairly expensive and is so feature-rich that there can be a steep learning curve for beginners/non-technically minded writers. It is available for PC AND Mac. On the other hand, Logic comes with a superb set of stock instruments and effects (like Space Designer - a brilliant convolution reverb) that makes it ideal as an all-in-one solution for people who might not already own or wish to purchase additional plugin packages, and is very affordable at \u00a3200. It is also highly intuitive and easy to pick up, as Apple products tend to be. However, since it is an Apple product, PC users are out of luck since it runs exclusively on Mac OS. Like Pro Tools, Ableton Live is available for both PC and Mac. It is a different proposition from Pro Tools entirely, however; less focused on traditional audio applications in favour of loop-based production which makes it ideal for many types of dance music production. Personally, I find this way of working a bit limiting, though - you can often tell just by listening to a track that it was written in Ableton because less-proficient users commonly fall into a pattern of working section by section, building up each part as they loop. This, in my opinion, can result in disjointed-sounding tracks that fail to transition in an interesting way. At the end of the day, as I mentioned earlier, it all comes down to personal preference. It would be great to get some clarification over what exactly you were looking for with your question - I\u2019ll be happy to go into more detail and help you out as best I can. In the meantime, I hope that I have given you a satisfying brief overview of the three most popular programs for music writing/production available today. Feel free to message me or reply in the comments if you\u2019d like clarification on anything I\u2019ve said or have further questions. All the best, Benedict ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend Sibelius for score editing (classical music and people who like to get more into the traditional aspects of music). A close second is Finale. The choice between the two depends on personal preference, and if you need to get really into the details. A lot of what I have to say can be found in answers to similar questions like What is the best musical score editing software for polyrythms? If you\u2019re interested in working with sheet music, staves and clefs and all that, programs specifically catering to classical music exist. I\u2019ve heard from other composers in university that the score features in popular DAW software like Cubase and Logic Pro are more limited, but if all you intend to use is the piano roll, then software with strong MIDI capabilities (Ableton, FL Studio, Logic, and Cubase are the most accessible and thus, most popular probably in that order) is the way to go. I want to add that I don\u2019t have much writing experience with Cubase and Pro Tools, but that doesn\u2019t at all mean they\u2019re unusable. Hans Zimmer (movie composer for, among others, The Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean, basically every Christopher Nolan movie) is frequently cited as solely using Cubase, and many others will use Pro Tools or Digital Performer (made by Mark Of The Unicorn or MOTU, Mac exclusive, very similar to Pro Tools) for film scores. For software where you compose into and edit scores and sheet music, the two most popular by far are Sibelius and Finale, and the free option is MuseScore. I only have experience with these three, but others seem to be making an impact (Forte or MagicScore) or are developed by heavy-hitters in the audio industry (like Steinberg\u2019s Dorico, or PreSonus\u2019 Notion, which has an iOS app that sets the bar for classical music). MuseScore is free, but thus has no business model and is developed by independents and volunteers in the online community. The desire and effort is there, but without revenue there\u2019s no army of developers working fulltime on a solid program, and there\u2019s no standard to meet, so the software is somewhat buggy and limited. Finale\u2019s users seem to be the most dedicated of any software, with a general feeling of \u201cFinale is the best and anything else is inadequate\u201d. Finale I would say is likely the most powerful, but very unintuitive and tedious to work with. Sibelius\u2019 users seem to be the most realistic, and figure that Sibelius can do everything they need it to, and easily, \u201cit just works\u201d. I prefer Sibelius. Finale has long been the standard (it\u2019s been around since 1988, Sibelius was first available in 1993), but Sibelius Software notably was purchased by Avid Technology in 2006. Avid are the makers of Pro Tools, long the industry standard for recording music. ",
