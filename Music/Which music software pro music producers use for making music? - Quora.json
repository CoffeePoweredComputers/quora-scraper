            "answer_text": "A lot music producers use pro tools, logic, reason, mpc, ableton, and native instruments. There are plenty of others as well but those are some of the most well known ones. Also I wouldn\u2019t focus so much on what the pro\u2019s use, a pro can use anything. I would focus on finding what resonates with you and just practice non stop. Anybody listening to your music won\u2019t care what you used, they just care if it\u2019s good or not. Youtube also has plenty videos on how to use equipment too, that can be very helpful. ",
