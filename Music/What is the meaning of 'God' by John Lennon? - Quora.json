            "answer_text": "John Lennon's \"God\" | A Triptych // A Song in Three Parts [Panel One/Part One] God is a concept by which we measure our pain.I'll say it again: God is a concept by which we measure our pain. Marx: Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soul-less conditions. Psalm 34:18 \"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.\" Psalm 147:3 \"He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.\" Revelation 21:4 \"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain.\" [Panel Two/Part Two] Men have many idols. Religion is an idol. Politics also an idol. Rock and Roll, like religion, has it's idols. We make these things our gods. Lennon is disavowing these. I don't believe in magicI don't believe in I-ChingI don't believe in BibleI don't believe in tarotI don't believe in HitlerI don't believe in JesusI don't believe in KennedyI don't believe in BuddhaI don't believe in mantraI don't believe in GitaI don't believe in yogaI don't believe in kingsI don't believe in ElvisI don't believe in ZimmermanI don't believe in Beatles The Beatles will be the focus of part three. He finishes part two saying the only thing he can be sure of is himself. The only thing he can believe with full assurance is his own existence...and Yoko. I just believe in me...Yoko and me. [Panel Three/Part Three] The cult of the Beatles has gotten out of control.This project is finished. John is moving on. He's asking the listener to move on as well. And that's reality. The dream is over. What can I say? The dream is over.Yesterday I was the dream weaver. But now I'm reborn.I was the Walrus. But now I'm John.And so dear friends - you just have to carry on. The dream is over. He uses pseudo-Christian terminology, \"I'm reborn.\" (\u201cBorn again.\u201d)Baptised in the water of Yoko. And resurrected as John.Remember that John the baptist was a prophet.Some who idolize Lennon see him as a prophet of sorts as well.(Why else would we be analyzing this song.) There is much more to say. I think this covers the basics. ",

            "answer_text": "It is my belief that John Lennon was a deeply wounded man who struggled, through his music, to identify his demons. As often the case with sensitive artists, he tried various methods while exploring his psyche. Alcohol, drugs and therapies were his tools to divulge his inner turmoil. Listening to \u201c GOD, \u201c I hear him pointing out the many ways people have of beating around the bush. The line, \u201c I don\u2019t believe in Beatles, \u201c is his way of turning the past over to memories. The last refrain seems to state that the sixties are over and done with and tomorrow\u2019s reality beckons. The dream is seen as being over, but in reality, the Beatles\u2019 music is immortal. ",
