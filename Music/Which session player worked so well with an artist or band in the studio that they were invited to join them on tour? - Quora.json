            "answer_text": "Michael Bloomfield and Al Kooper. Both played on the sessions for Bob Dylan\u2019s Highway 61 Revisited album and both were invited to tour with Dylan in his first live electric band. Kooper became Dylan\u2019s organ player for several 1965 dates, including the Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield played with Dylan at Newport and also with the Paul Butterfield Blues band at the festival. Both performances were considered heretical and controversial by folk purists. What is not widely known, is that Bloomfield was also a guest member of the Butterfield Band at that point, having previously been a studio session sit in. Dylan wanted Bloomfield to tour with him, but Bloomfield opted to join Butterfield full time. ",

            "answer_text": "Session guitarist Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter was made a full time member of The Doobie Brothers in 1974 after Steely Dan retired from touring & after guest work on their albums \u201cThe Captain & Me\u201d in 1973 & \u201cWhat Were Once Vices Are Now Habits\u201d in 1974. His full member stint began with the \u201cStampede\u201d album in 1975 & ended after the tour for the \u201cMinute By Minute\u201d album in 1979. Session guitarist Larry Carlton was also made a full member of the jazz/soul band The Crusaders in 1971 & toured & recorded with them through 1976, then sporadically after. While a member of The Crusaders he still carried on as session guitarist playing on albums by artists such as Steely Dan & Joni Mitchell among many. He was probably the most active guitarist of the \u201870s & is on so many great albums of that & other decades since. His story is quite an interesting one which includes recovering from being mistakenly shot in the throat outside a recording studio by a teenager & not being able to play a guitar again until paralysis in his left arm had healed. A very nice guy who is very appreciative & kind to his fans. ",
