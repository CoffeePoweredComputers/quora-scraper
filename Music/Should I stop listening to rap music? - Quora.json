            "answer_text": "If you want to stop, you stop. You have to listen to your parents a lot, but the fact that you're (mentally) old enough to have a Quora account, means that little choices like this are choices that you should take yourself. Music can make you think and change your emotions, but have you ever heard of someone shooting up a school after a Notorious B.I.G. listen? Or someone overdosing on cocaine because of a Pusha T song? No. It\u2019s your choice. I don't really care whether you stop or not, but don't let other opinions influence that. You're a grown person. Don't take those words too strongly. Don't go out and buy a house, drink twenty shots of vodka, screw a prostitute in Denmark, and birth a child named Antonella. Do whatever the fuck you want to. Yes, I do curse a lot. That's not me liking rap, it's me being birthed in a poor Venezuelan family. The fact that I\u2019m related to a former MLB player that attacked multiple farm workers with a machete should tell you that alone. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe you should just focus a little more on being a better son and then your question becomes a moot point? Try to swear less. If you're around friends and just goofing around, then whatevs. But around most adults or in public, it just makes you look ignorant or like the punk ass teen you may actually be. Parents are going to be a pain in the ass to some degree. But you can play the game and keep them on your side. Pick your fights\u2026swearing should not be one of them. Rap has influenced me positively throughout my life. Don't try to be a gangsta\u2026 you'll just look like a clown and/or get in to trouble. ",
