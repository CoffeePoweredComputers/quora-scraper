            "answer_text": "The \u201970s were like 2 decades. The early seventies had great bands still from the 60s and early 70s. There were too many to count. I there is one good hard rock band today there were 50 then. Then rock died and you had bands like Styx, REO Speedwagon, older burned out bands like Deep Purple. Then you had Disco and horrible pop songs. Kind of like today. But the second half of the \u201970s had riches of great Punk and then later new wave bands. So the 70s started with Led Zeppelin and ending with the Blondie, Talking Heads, Ramones, The Clash. Pretty good variety. Steve Dahl the first hardcore shock jock who was from Chicago coined the term Disco Sucks. It caught on. Then in the middle of a White Sox doubleheader at Comiskey Park, they had a promotion called Disco Demolition. They were going to blow up and burn Disco records. Tough thugs from the Southside (the White South Side, fyi) were buying Disco records to destroy. WAY more people showed up. The records blew up and the fire dept had to show up and the Sox forfeited the 2nd game. Hell, people were using records as Frisbees. That was a rough fricking park back in the day. But after Disco Demolition disco just seemed to quickly fizzle out. Thank you, Steve Dahl! Disco Demolition will Youtube up. You had the great Jimmy Pearsall commenting on the destruction. Harry Caray was Jimmy\u2019s partner. Harry must have left the scene. Jimmy was a great Red Sox player and he was too honest of an announcer. We BiPolar types are usually too honest. ",
