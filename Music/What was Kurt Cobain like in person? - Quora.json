            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure, but by most accounts he was shy, respectful and alternated between high intensity and very low energy (pointing to a likely bipolar illness diagnosis). He was imbued with brilliance, perhaps even some genius qualities (many seem to say he was a sub-par musician, but this isn\u2019t the point; like Lennon, he had the gift of channeling authentic feeling without censure or agenda, an incredibly rare talent, that of a true bluesman\u2014Leadbelly\u2014and this authenticity is why the world responded so massively\u2014Here listen to my bleeding, cauterized, toxic soul on my sleeves\u2014combined with his ability to constantly live in the \u201cwhole is more than the sum of the parts,\u201d which is a creative ability characterized by integrating unseen relationships to create a global sense that flows like blood instead of analyzes overthinks ). Listen to \u201cSomething in the Way,\u201d and unplugged\u2019s, \u201cWhere did you Sleep Last Night\u201d and you will see what I mean. Many will say he was just full of bullshit, and we was, knew that he was, and yet when it came down to the creative process, anything but. Generally, when kids are unwelcome or emotionally abandoned, endure bullying or endure a harsh divorce, they can develop a highly resentful, cynical and hateful view of their fellow humans, especially those who didn\u2019t suffer these deprivations. Without intervention, it can create a miserable life, crystalizing into rejection of culture as a life value, and surely understandable as part of his identity if these were true variables. And yet, such an identity is at core unhealthy, because while the narrative fits the experience, the lifestyle produced only results in bigger problems, for example consolidating an identity around being a victim that dropping out is cool, and engaging in substance abuse. How massively ironic and hypocritical crazy making it must have felt when this very identity incurred previously incomprehensible levels of success, fame and wealth\u2014the very thing his experiences informed him he should hate the most, which he wanted, but could not accept due to his history of devaluation\u2014quite possibly the seeds of a narcissistic problem. People with pathologically narcissistic traits are widely condemned for their emotional abuses, lies and manipulations, but having these traits is probably one of the most painful conditions a person can have. The problem originates early, with inconsistent bonding between mother and child (the core of adult insecurity), a combination of a temperamentally sensitive child (nature, genetic predisposition) growing up with parents who are very low on the emotional intelligence scale (e.g. do not provide consistent emotional attunement. For example, kid comes home and tells dad he fell off his bike, dad says, not looking up from his paper, mindlessly, \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t hurt yourself\u201d), resulting in a pervasive sense of feeling ignored or being not authentically seen/understood). A complex developmental trauma results, one that can only be coped or survived by replacing the actual self (insecure, shame-based, devalued and self-loathing) with a false self, which manifests in two identities: the Overt (overtly grandiose, entitled, exploitive) and the Covert (shy, ashamed, victim for the world). Both of these presentations have one core goal in mind: to manipulate others into regulating their self-esteem for them, because they are unable to do so. Kurt\u2019s image, of a tortured, self-hating artist covertly worked for him in the small local scene until something untenable occurred, the massive fame and success indicated above. By using the unhealthy persona to build Nirvana\u2019s image was much more than a marketing strategy; it was a vital reflection of his inner anguish. Only now the stakes were much higher. He was exposed, with millions calling on him to perpetuate the false image, he expressed as a lie all along. Rock stars who have this kind of problem face a unique burden, because their false self, which normally would be outrageously incongruent to the average person (hopefully resulting in constant feedback their arrogance, entitlement and manipulation will not be tolerated\u2014leading to healthy changes) is instead validated by millions, an irresistible source of temptation, however ghostly. But like a house of cards, the vital ruse comes crashing, and when that happens, when the person with narcissism loses their false self, the result is probably the most severe form of emotional suffering ever (Million describes this as the \u201cfailed narcissist,\u201d an awful inner experience which is the closest approximation to imminent physical death a person and endure). Gus Van Sant\u2019s movie about Kurt, \u201cLast Days,\u201d is fairly accurate I think. Sometimes those of us who burn twice as bright burn half as long. Maybe that\u2019s just truth, a truth of the human condition. ",

            "answer_text": "I never met him and like most first heard of him when\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" exploded from nowhere onto our screens.I've read most reputable books on Nirvana and Kurdt Cobain (those of you who know your stuff will get that) and purely based on an opinion formed from those books, he would have been the sort of person I detest. He came across as anti-anyone who was successful in high school (be it sport, academics, or generally kids that worked hard).He loved to play the 'misunderstood' youth and embellished many stories about his hardships purely for attention.He came across as a very talented artist, yet had a twisted side and found things like masturbating onto his own artwork so that 'his DNA' was part of the art, hilarious and people wouldn't know he had cum on his paintings.He had an obsession with things that most people are horrified by. (He had a VHS tape of the R. Budd Dwyer tradgedy - which was a live press conference in 1987 where the treasurer of Pennsylvania shot himself in front of the news crew) and used to play this tape over and over and enjoyed showing people who came to visit.He came across as a sook who often looked to get out of hard work. Yes he did work hard at a part time job he had in a store I believe, and he did try starting up a cleaning business at a young age, and he worked very hard with Nirvana.He had Nirvana planned to a T and worked hard to project the image of 'not giving a fuck' and desperately wanted to be famous in the beginning, although didn't want to be seen wanting this, and this ultimately led to his demise.In my opinion if Dave Grohl didn't join the band we wouldn't know who Nirvana were.He was dirty and disruptive, couldn't give a shit about other people's property or life really.He was undeniably talented as a unique musician and songwriter although his guitar ability was sub par. Andy Wallace deserves more credit than he has been given with Butch Vig.This is all my opinion based on what I've read and summised. ",
