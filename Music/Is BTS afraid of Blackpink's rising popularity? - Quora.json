            "answer_text": "I don\u00b4t know what goes through their heads, but I\u00b4m pretty sure they aren\u00b4t. As a fan of both I can tell you they are in very different moments in their carers. BTS has an already impressive catalogue of music and now seem more focused on experimenting with it and expressing their artistic side through music, they are a very well stablished group and don\u00b4t really need popularity. A very good example of this is MOTS 7, where you see them reflect on their life and journey and also experiment not only with music, but with dances as well, they don\u00b4t try to be popular, they try to innovate. Blackpink on the other hand just had their first album (only 8 songs) released. Their catalogue is still pretty empty and most of their songs sound pretty much the same. Until last year, they could\u00b4ve still been considered rookies because of their lack of performances in total. They are trying to establish themselves as artists and finding their own unique sound. With the change of CEO in YGE they seem to be getting the chance to do so and I honestly think that they have a very bright future ahead of them, I don\u00b4t doubt they have the talent and the drive to achive great things! While they sort of compete in the same market, they are in very different places carer wise and are successful enough so that their whole success doesn\u00b4t hinge on them being only popular. ",
