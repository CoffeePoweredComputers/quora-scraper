            "answer_text": "A2A I think that, perhaps, when the band is good, the name becomes good\u2026 whether it was a good name or not. I think Fall Out Boy is a proper stupid name (same with My Chemical Romance); but then, I've never had a very high opinion of either. Queen could have been a silly name; REM and U2 could have been ludicrous names; hell, The Beatles could have had an idiotic homophone of a name\u2026 but these bands were so iconic that we began to associate the superiority of music with the names. In fact, I don't believe I can think of one band whose music is shit but they somehow have a really cool band name. ",
