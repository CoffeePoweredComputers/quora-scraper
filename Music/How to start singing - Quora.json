            "answer_text": "Here are some tips to get you started for your musical journey. This approach is only for western songs and not classical ones. Since this is your first time, pick a song which is easy to sing. Don't go for songs which have high pitch yet.Once your song is decided, listen to it very closely. Identify the pattern of the beats and tune.Do not try to sing along with the song if you're really interested in improving your singing skills.Memorise the verse, and try to sing with all the components that you registered in your brain in step 2.If you feel you're messing up the tune, listen to that part again and break down your approach to master each and every line.Be patient, it's just the start.If you feel you're getting better, record your voice while singing. You'll come to know about remaining loose ends.Once you're done, send the recording to your friends and ask for honest opinions. You can also perform in front of them.Once you've mastered a song, change the song and repeat the steps till you no longer need anyone else to correct your mistakes.Or you can just hire a music teacher.Cheers.

            "answer_text": "Have you seen The Sound of Music?  Do re mi?  You can start with learning a basic scale.  Singing starts with talking on pitch.  You basically use pitch when talking already, so all you need to do is change your pitch to match the note as you talk though a song.   It is fine to try and match pitch and sing along with music that has words, but don't try to copy their style or exact sound.  Aim for a straightforward method, until you build confidence in a solid basic singing voice first.  You want to sing like you, not like somebody else.  Everyone has a unique vocal instrument, no matter how similar or unique your voice may or may not be to anyone else's.  Ideally you would take lessons or join a choir or group that can help you, and you can always do book and video learning for some basic concepts and to train your ears to hear how others sound.  To hear how you sound, you can record yourself, and then a teacher can help guide you on how to produce consistent, clear, resonant sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Would you be open to learning how to play the guitar? Also, what type of music are you most interested in singing?  If you're interested in singing contemporary music, I would highly recommend learning basic guitar. It may take you only a few months or less to get comfortable with the basic chords. After that, you will be able to look up chords for most songs and accompany yourself. If you'd prefer to sing other genres like classical or jazz, then most likely you would need to start taking voice lessons or post a craigslist ad looking for someone who wants to practice piano (or another accompanying instrument). I think there are probably a decent number of random strangers who would be open to such an arrangement, particularly if you live in a city. You could also specify people who are interested in performing at low-pressure venues. I returned to singing mainly because I was playing guitar often, and wanted to be a more well-rounded performer. I started taking voice lessons and also playing piano to accompany myself. ",

But yes as you have already said that you have some basic knowledge about singing try to revise things you have learned and once its done. Find out what can be learned next, there are many youtube channels and videos that provides free singing lesson try to follow them( I personally follow ones that have an substantial number of subscribers but its completely depends upon you)And as per instruments are concerned download apps from playstore that gives the sound of the basic instruments like keyboard etc. I know the original sound may differ but it is an cheap and easy way to start with atleast they will provide basic scale practice atleast. Once it's mastered and you still feel to improve further an music teacher can then take you to the next level. But as you just want to sound good even regular practice of what I have recommended may help. I hope it helps. Thank you for reading. ",
