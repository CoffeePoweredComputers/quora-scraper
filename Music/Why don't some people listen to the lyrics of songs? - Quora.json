            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a few reasons. I think it\u2019s mostly get caught up in the melody and the beat and just go along with it and don\u2019t take the time to process the lyrics through our language centers in our brains. Simply put, we are hearing the lyrics, but not listening to them. In other words, we do not engage with the music (as we would in an active conversation) but we just passively hear it. For example, I recall way back when the song \u201cBrick\u201d by Ben Folds Five was on the radio (1997: I just looked it up). I probably listened to it for a full two or three months (off and on on the radio or the video was on TV) before I suddenly paused and really listened to the lyrics and suddenly realized it was about a guy taking his girlfriend to get an abortion the day after Christmas. Wow. Didn\u2019t change my appreciation for the song, but I was suddenly more mindful about what he (and other songs) were saying. BTW: Back in the old days, radios weren\u2019t as good as they are now. It was a little harder to hear the lyrics. For example (and this is a big one): I saw the movie Grease when it came out in the theaters. It was one of my sister\u2019s all-time favorite movies. She played the soundtrack nonstop one summer. Then, decades later, my wife and I go to the Grease Sing-Along movie (the movie with animated song lyrics on the screen: if you get a chance to see it, go \u2013 the lyrics are well done and funny). And then the lyrics for \u201cGreased Lightning\u201d come on the screen. I had \u201cheard\u201d this song countless times. And this was the first time I realized just how dirty those lyrics are. \u201cYou know it ain\u2019t no sh*t we\u2019ll be getting lots of tit in greased lightning\u2026 you are supreme, the chicks will cream\u2026 you know I ain\u2019t braggin\u2019 she\u2019s a really pussy wagon\u2026 greased lightning.\u201d WOWZA. Quite an eye opener, I must say! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I love this question. My answer? probably not typical . . . I love music because it is \u2018kin\u2019 to proverb, psalms, hidden meanings, and pieces (sometimes broken) of Life himself/herself. Those of us who \u2018listen to lyrics\u2019, are more hungry for understanding, than American Band Stand dance swagger. ( I do like to dance too, but I can \u2018really dance\u2019 when the \u2018understanding of the song pushes the buttons within my heart, gut, soul, and belly button.) Most others? I tend to understand just listen to music and the words they never hear, because it only plugs into their brain hard-drive . . . and misses what is hidden below their \u2018neck\u2019.  I guess? the same reason that most can\u2019t plug into the things of \u2018the Spirit\u2019, their brain just files it in the \u2018thinking and filing dept. of their brains . . . and they do not have the desire to \u2018digest\u2019 it within their soul. (got more important stuff to do ya know . . . buy stuff, go places, and figure out where to spend the money that they don\u2019t really have . . . but the love of adoring what that money could do is more fun for them. OK, gawd, I\u2019ll shut up now. That\u2019s what I sniff, anyhow. Will that give a bit of \u2018twist\u2019 to the question and answer too? Hey, you have a great day. from \u2018Cubby\u2019 and then? their is the \u2018failsafe\u2019 version.  ",
