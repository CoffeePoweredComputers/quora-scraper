            "answer_text": "Well, King of some category sometimes not subjective. Its a title given to unanimously the best of the best group/person in the category, someone that stands out from the rest. The king (father to be more precise) of Classical music is Johann Sebastian Bach, King of Pop is Michael Jackson and King of rock is Elvis Presley. The people mentioned based on every single aspect made them the King of their respective categories. So who is the King of K-pop? Well based on criteria of being near perfect and being on another level to the rest in terms of music only, it would be Big Bang. They separate themselves from the rest of K-pop acts in terms of musical style, album/record sales, concert tours you name it. Each member of Big Bang all have successful careers and they are the ones who fused western influences into K-pop shaping up the style of music K-pop is today. That\u2019s a fact. Plus they have consistently done so at the top level for more than 10 years and counting something which Big Bang is the first and only group to have been able to do. Many acts tend to disband after around 7 years and even if they don't disband, they do not reach the same kind of success they once had, for example, Super Junior who reached major success with hits like \u2018Sorry Sorry\u2019 but never reached that success again thereafter. Moreover, Big Bang is the Idols of Idols. many of the current acts notably BTS have been influenced by Big Bang and have taken what Big Bang has laid out both domestically and internationally and developed it to another level, hence their major success in the U.S (I personally think BTS is very unique and in terms of influence have eclipsed Big Bang). However, if it wasn\u2019t for Big Bang, K-pop artists and K-pop itself would not have developed into what it is today, which is why they are so respected by many K-pop acts. Hence, no matter how many groups are out there who have done well or are doing well, the structure of the current K-pop market has factually changed with Big Bang\u2019s success and because of that they are the people current K-pop acts look up upon (just look at interviews about other groups talking about Big Bang). Therefore, from an objective standpoint, the Kings of K-pop are Big Bang. ",

            "answer_text": "Hard to say but in my opinion it\u2019s: BTS & Bigbang   Both of this group have ENORMOUS impact that no one can come close to. The start from nobodies and they became legends BTS- Paved the way for K-pop to become big in the west. BTS became the only group in 50 years to have three number one albums on the Billboard 200 charts in less than 12 months, joining the ranks of The Beatles. They are the first group in Billboard history to spend five weeks at number one on the Billboard Artist 100 chart. They are also the first Asian act to win the \u2018Best Pop\u2019 Award. They also became the 1st Korean Group to perform at the MTV Video Music Awards.And many more they are also the #1 group in Korea (nation boy group) and many more Bigbang- They are recognized as one of the most popular bands in the world, having surpassed 140 million records sold. They are the first and only k-pop group to won the best artist from the world in 2016. They are also won the most influential group in Asia. They also invented lightstick. Bigbang are the act with the most digital hit songs in history, Their album hot issues (2007), Stand up (2008), Remember (2008) and Alive (2012) were also cited as one of the most digital albums in history and many more SO STAN BIGTANG FOR CLEAR SKIN!!!   As you can see both of the group have endless amout of achivements. Both start from nothing and became legends so i don\u2019t think one is better then the other bigbang are the kings of 2nd gen BTS are the kings of 3th gen and one day it gonna have the king of 4th that will continue the legacy and so on. I mean every king end up being detrone. Nobody can be a king forever So VIP\u2019s & Armies stop the fanwars both are King!!!   (English isn\u2019t my first languague so don\u2019t attack me plz) and it\u2019s my first time answering to a question so i hope you enjoy!!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 ",
