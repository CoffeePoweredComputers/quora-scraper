            "answer_text": "Yeah. It's not even that hard, you just need to learn how to position your bow. Let\u2019s say you wanted to to play C# (2nd finger on the A string), and E (first finger on the D string) Tilt your bow so it's touching both strings. It might seem easy but often you'll miss one and end up with a scratchy sound. Put as much pressure as you normally would. I personally think it's harder to play it well from open D to open G and open A to open E but that's probably just me. It's easier to practice with open strings first since it's easier to know how/when to reposition your bow. Hope this helped :) Bai~ ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s called double stopping. Playing two notes simultaneously is not too hard - those notes will be on adjacent strings. The curvature of the bridge makes playing three or four at once not strictly possible, although you can first strike one or two lower strings and immediately after then play higher strings. This leaves the lower strings resonating whilst the others are played. Enjoy your music ",
