            "answer_text": "They had so many songs that featured 12-string guitar that it\u2019s almost like making a list of most of their mid-period stuff. But I\u2019ll make that list. A Hard Day\u2019s Night. Actually, I\u2019m not too excited by the song, which I\u2019ve heard too many times, but the intro and the fading ringing 12-string at the end elevate it to brilliance.\u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Spoil the Party.\u201d One of Harrison\u2019s greatest solos in this song.\u201cWhat You\u2019re Doing\u201d is a nice Buddy HOlly pastiche with a great little 12-string guitar figure going through it.Speaking of Buddy Holly, the cover of \u201cWords of Love\u201d is feast for 12-string guitar lovers.And \u201cEverybody Wants to Be My Baby\u201d has two guitar solos. (I think that\u2019s twelve string, sound like it to me.)Ticket To Ride. This 12-string guitar is just one piece of this incredible song.\u201cIf I Needed Someone\u201d is lovely post-Byrds Beatles.\u201cRain\u201d\u2014great guitar, great bass, great drums, great vocals.",
