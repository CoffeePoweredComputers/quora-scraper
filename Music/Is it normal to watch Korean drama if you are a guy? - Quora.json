            "answer_text": "Liking Korean dramas is just a sign that the guy likes romance, cute things, and shows both soft and hard sides. Korean dramas are generally pretty well balanced. There\u2019s some action, mystery, and comedy, mixed in with romance and cuteness - it doesn\u2019t have to be over the top, either. Dramas are youthful. They blend worlds, between reality and fantasy - dramas like W, and crossovers between the past and present. They also teach compromise and acceptance between young and old, in relationships, with family, between friends, between colleagues. There are opportunities for forgiveness, and struggles for characters to find themselves. Dramas lend themselves to sufficient character development, so that you get to know what different personalities and individual challenges are, and learn to find perspective with real people. There\u2019s nothing unmasculine about them. I\u2019d say there are better displays of masculinity in the shows than what you might see every day. Maybe they are sometimes sprinkled in, so that you appreciate the gentle, but firm, manilness more, as opposed to outright stereotyping, but it depends on the drama. Things like Healer and City Hunter that are more action based are pretty manly, compared to a number of dramas with Lee Jong Suk, where you get this boy-man, or man-boy, someone who is young, but has quite a tough side, a very romantic side, a slightly aggressive side, and also a very cute side. I\u2019m a woman, and the thing I like most about Korean dramas is the masculinity balanced with a tender, caring side. Men and women are not perfect, they always do some things wrong and need forgiving, and in dramas they can showcase humanity by collecting all the things that make women and men swoon, and combining them with elements of entertainment like action and comedy, even dark personal history, historic events, and all kinds of dangerous things, to bring people, couples, friends, families, together, in the end. I wish my husband would enjoy them, I always have to watch by myself. Not that I don\u2019t enjoy watching them by myself either ;) He doesn\u2019t fit the profile, I guess. Stubborn and generally unbending, not particularly demonstrative, the moments where the ideal comes in are sometimes few and far between, but maybe my expectations are too much affected by the dream guy ideal that you get in dramas. Men can learn from Korean dramas. The bad guy doesn\u2019t get the girl. The bad guy isn\u2019t very happy. The bad guy lives a lie. Heck, no wonder men with a heart want to watch the guy who is good, honest, caring, and doesn\u2019t live a lie, get the girl and live happily, or, not get the girl, but love the girl enough for her to be happy. Even melodramas have heart. I just can\u2019t manage them because I get too depressed :D ",

            "answer_text": "I happen to be one of the many male fans of Korean dramas, and yes they do exist as couple of people on this thread pointed out. There were male fans of Korean dramas that exist even before Dramafever and Viki was founded. Here's an old article from early 2000's: Korean soaps lure unlikely audience and I'll quote: On a recent Saturday night a group of white, middle-class TV fans gathered at a Northwest Side cafe to watch the final episode of their favorite show and to say goodbye to a cast of ethnically homogenous characters who had come to feel like friends. Their names, however, were not Joey, Chandler, Phoebe or Rachel. But rather Jang Geum, Jung Ho, Geum Young and Joong Jong. \"We got about 500 e-mails from people who were not Korean but who were fans of the show,\" says Kwang Dong Jo, vice president of the station that is also known as KBC-TV. \"We never expected that the non-Korean Americans would be watching these shows.\" But they were, each falling into it in similar accidental ways and getting hooked. \"I was flipping through the TV, and there was this historical drama with subtitles that I just started following, and I got hooked,\" says Darinka D'Alessio. \"My husband originally would walk past while I watching and say, 'You're nuts,' but now he is sucked into it too.\" Even some of the Hollywood producers/directors (dominated by men) have acknowledged the power of Korean dramas shown in this video below:  Also the producers of The Walking Dead have also announced they'll do a pre-apocalyptic K-drama that take place in South Korea: Robert Kirkman and Skybound Announce Korean Drama, Five Year - IGN \u2018Walking Dead\u2019 Producers Set Pre-Apocalyptic Korean Drama Series With Viki 'The Walking Dead' producers to shoot Korean drama From Variety article: David Alpert, Skybound president and co-founder, said he and Kirkman have long been fans of Korean films and TV shows. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be launching what we hope is the first of many collaborations with the Korean entertainment industry,\u201d he said. The \u201cFive Year\u201d story \u201chighlights the intense interpersonal moments that Korean dramas capture so well, and sets them against the epic backdrop for which Skybound has become known.\u201d and from IGN article: Five Year is a passion project of Alpert and Kirkman's, as they're both fans of Korean culture and K-Dramas, and wanted to find a way to tell a story in that format and setting with their own twist. \"We've really just been in love with the content that's coming out of Korea. For us, it's just been a question as to how do we do something, how can we participate. We're two American guys who love Korean culture and entertainment, but aren't fluent in Korean, we're not part of the Korean entertainment community; what is it we can bring?\" he said. \"We had a property that was something that spoke to our brand -- I think we're known for telling epic stories, things that have a giant sense of scale and scope -- and were figuring out where's the intersection between that and what K-Dramas do so well, which is really just the absolute maximum emotion out of these characters interacting.\" So there are male fans of Korean dramas. I hope these help. ",
