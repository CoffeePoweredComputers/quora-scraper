            "answer_text": "Thanks for AAA No and I really hope I do. Why? He can sing. Like really he can, have you seen him on billboard charts. He dethroned himself recently twice and became the first person to do so with his song \u201cDespacito\u201d.His songs are beautiful and melodious. His live acoustic performances are to die for.Even so that the then US President Barack Obama invited him along with many reputed artists to sing at the White House.( 2011)He is very grateful to us and even though he is a human being and gets tired of always being in the spotlight and acting a certain way he still meets his fans randomly and talks to them.He did peed on a bucket and unfortunately had papparazis snapping him at that time and apologized for it too. Just like many actors and artists and many humans, he did something wrong and not forgettable but not really harmful to any other human being but he apologized the right way.He never called his fans animals.He never slut-shamed anyone on Instagram.He has a beautiful song \u201cLove Yourself\u201d which has now crossed 1 billion views and to this date one of my favorite songs. His vocals are amazing.Bonus: Also he meets underprivileged and poor children whenever he can or mostly children because he thinks they are real to him. They talk to him as a friend and not as Justin Bieber. Really who wouldn't want to meet him. ",

These days he promotes his devotion to God and has close ties with Hillsong United. The paparazzi still stalks him around, but he definitely has his composure now and lets them flow as trivial annoyances. Sometimes he even responds to some of the stupid questions they ask and realizes its their job to do so. I like the kid. He seems like he really wants to change the world. And help people. He\u2019s a goofy kid too, you should check his stories out on instagram. Some of them really make me laugh. You can\u2019t really blame him for the fame. ",
