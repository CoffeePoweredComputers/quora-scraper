            "answer_text": "Voices have two main parts: chest and head. The middle voice or register is an almost equal mixture of the chest and head voices.  A well-trained voice will have a mix of head and chest  in all notes of your range. Lower notes will of course have more chest and higher notes will have more head-but the muscles that control the head and chest voice are engaged throughout your range if you are trained properly.  Vocal training involves learning how to coordinate the muscles so that the two voices are NEVER separated. It is that separation and the lack of coordination of these muscles that causes the \"breaks\"-those places in the voice where there is a definate change in the tone quality. A singer with breaks will end up sounding liek two or three differet people when they sing. The tones in the \"breaks\" are usually the notes that the untrained or undertrained singer fears singing-they tend to crack on those notes since that is the point where the muscles aren't working together. It is for this reason that voice teachers will work with the student to get the middle voice in shape before extending the vocal range in either direction. A trained middle voice is a good indicator that the muscles that control head and chest are coordinated enough to start to extend the range of the singer. Higher notes are almost all head, so you will get the sense that the sound is exiting through the top of your skull-thus, the term, \"head\". But in reality, both chest and head voice muscles are working. The chest muscles add enough color and warmth to those higher tones and add weight so that those tones don't sound piercing or shrill or\"baby\" like. A woman singing high notes in pure head is very unpleasant for this reason. Lower notes feel more like they are settling in your chest, but in reality, they aren't-what you are feeling is resonance. Again, your head voice muscles are also working-those muscles add warmth to the tone so it doesn't sound harsh and overly heavy. Think of a Broadway belter, or someone like Alanis Morrissette for an example of someone who sings purely in chest-it is a harsh, chesty sound. Someone who sings entirely in this manner will probably not have a very developed head voice, and it will sound weak and/or shrill when they try. A trained voice with no breaks is what is called the \"even\" voice. The even voice has no changes in consistancy of tone throughout the singer's range. Listen to people who are trained classically-particularly, professional opera singers-there is no place in their voices where there are any breaks. Classical training specifically eliminates the breaks, which is critical for classical singing. ",
