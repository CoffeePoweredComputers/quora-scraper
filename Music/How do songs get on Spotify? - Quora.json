            "answer_text": "To get your music on Spotify, you need to work with a distributor, or with a record label who already has a distributor. They handle all the licensing and distribution, and pay your streaming royalties. If you don't currently have a distributor, check out the provider directory to see preferred and recommended distributors that meet our standards for providing quality metadata and protecting against infringement. Each service is unique, so be sure to do a little homework before picking one. Most charge a fee or commission. Note: If you want to submit music for playlist consideration, it must be unreleased and submitted early. It\u2019s best to pick a distributor that allows you to set a release date at least a week in advance. Once your music is delivered to Spotify, you can claim your profile on Spotify for Artists. -Ernestas from Virra Marketing ",
