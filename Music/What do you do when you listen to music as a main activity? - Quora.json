            "answer_text": "To be honest, I cancelled music for a bit to give my mind a break. I felt like my brain was on drugs or something. They say that when you do something for too long, or too much, sooner or later your\u2019e going to become addicted or depend on it. I ultimately felt like I was starting to become dependent on music through so much consumption and I couldn\u2019t allow myself to think my own thoughts. Its a huge dopamine rush and I would find myself bored without it, so I decided to take a break for a while and ease my mind so that I can think properly. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I would do everything with music playing in the background. I would basically live my life as if I was inside of a music video 24/7. Everything from waking up, to taking a shower, eating & sleeping. Going out or even just staying in. I loved music and adored it because it engaged my actions and didn\u2019t allow any room to get so caught up in my feelings too much. I would live out someone else\u2019s life Music is a great thing for sure, but its even better when you decide to break away for a while ",

            "answer_text": "I listen to a lot of audiobooks when working\u2026 as most of my work is manual or repetitive. When I walk, to the stores or a couple of miles to reach a train or with the dogs - anytime I walk alone - I listen to music. When I read I ALWAYS have appropriate music and it\u2019s almost all from film scores. I re-read all of the Conan stories from the DeCamp and Carter era (Yes, I know the original R.E. Howard material is all that has any literary value, but I grew up with Lancer paperbacks) I listened to Basil Poledouris as well as other sword and sorcery film scores. When I read a book of essays on 2001: A Space Odyssey, I had the soundtrack album + the Alex North score + miscellaneous Ligeti. I have playlists for Tarzan and other pulp jungle stories, for Doc Savage and other pulp adventure and another for retro science fiction\u2026 I just re-read the first couple of Dune novels and used a playlist of the Toto score, Lawrence of Arabia, Zimmer\u2019s Blackhawk Down score\u2026 I recently read a couple of noirish exploitation novels first published as Gold Medal Original paperbacks and generated a playlist containing a lot of Ronald Stein music from \u201950s exploitation films, but garnished with some Alex North and Elmer Bernstein film music.
