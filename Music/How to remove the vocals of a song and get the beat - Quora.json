            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, this is one of those things that you\u2019ll actually have to put forth effort to accomplish. Basically, like Joshua A. Pfeiffer says, you\u2019ll need a DAW at the absolute least. Then, you\u2019ll probably need a plug-in that will do what you want. Here\u2019s the easiest guide I can give you to try to accomplish this. REAPER | Download Reaper is going to be your DAW. Don\u2019t listen to anyone else. Don\u2019t even try Pro-Tools at this point. Reaper or bust baby!! I\u2019ve used Cubase, Audition, Sonar, Pro-Tools. Nothing comes close, in my opinion. Its not as popular as some of the \u201cAAA\u201d DAWs on the market, mainly because its created by one dude. Its an Indie DAW!! How cool is that!! You get 90 days FULL FUNCTIONALITY and its only 60 bucks after that with over a year of full updates included. If You\u2019ve never used a DAW before (All of this is going to be a lot harder) here\u2019s a quick up to speed for your introduction to Reaper. Its followed by tons of tutorial videos and a great community to back it up . REAPER | Videos NOW THEN!!! You still with me??? Without moving on to some awesome plug-ins that will basically do this for you. You may be able to do this. Spread the WAV file wide with built in Stereo Widening. Then, slice and dice!!!! Take out the middle mid-low frequency. Basically neuture the track. You might get a little bit of bleed over and it\u2019ll sound crappy but there you go. OK, anyhoo\u2026.Plug-Ins are your friend!!! Onward and upward!!  Use ADX VVC!! Here\u2019s a video showing how to use it in Reaper. Closing Arguments: There is NOT going to be an end all app that you can feed audio into and take out the vocals. This is the path you must take unless you know someone who knows a thing or two about this stuff. These have fairly steep learning curves so, be prepared to pay attention during the tutorials otherwise you will be lost as all get out. Especially during the part when you\u2019re setting up your audio interfaces. Pay attention to where your outputs are going. These things are almost set up like actual hardware so, it really doesn\u2019t hold your hand through a lot of it. GREAT tutorial videos though. You\u2019ll need to learn how to mixdown back to whatever format you want so, keep that in mind. I actually have no problem whatsoever helping you out if your actually willing to learn how to do this. I WILL respond if you have questions. Good Luck!!! ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s pretty tricky and requires a lot of knowledge. There is this one thing called \u2018Phase cancellation\u2019. But you will require the original dry vocals of the artist. You would have to apply the effects to the vocals in precisely the same way and cancel the original track with the vocals. This video might help but just do it in reverse :  Another way would be to recreate the beat from scratch or just buy/download the instrumental. Phase cancellation is a pretty complex process and untill and unless you know what you\u2019re doing, you might end up with some really bad results. Once a song has been mixed and mastered, it becomes pretty hard to extract the vocals from the original track. It is certainly achievable and not impossible at all but the time, energy and frustration just isn\u2019t worth it. Instead, just recreate the beat from scratch. It\u2019ll be far more easier and effective. ",
