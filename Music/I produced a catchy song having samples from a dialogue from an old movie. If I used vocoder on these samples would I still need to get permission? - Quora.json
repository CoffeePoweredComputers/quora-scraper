Vocoder or not (and why not just use a formant filter\u2026 did you pipe the audio right into the mic or what?), you'll need their permission. The good news is that provided that you're respectful and not trying to steal something of genuine value from them. \u201cThe Force will be with you. Always.\u201d is going to be harder to secure rights to than will be \u201cYou came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.\u201d (even though the second one could really work for a pumping dance floor track\u2026 but I digress ). Also, securing the rights to samples may seem like a headache up front, but it's not nearly as bad as trying to secure them against court-ordered sanctions if your little track suddenly gets huge. That'll take the wind out of your sails really fast. Often, they'll only require credit and perhaps review (how you handle the second quote above, for example, could make that one go either way). They're not going to look for royalties or any financial compensation unless it's something like the first quote above where literally you'd be profiting from one of their most iconic pieces of audio. In the future, consider recording a friend with a good voice saying a line that sounds like it came from a movie, throw in some effects, and nobody will know it's not from a movie\u2026 they'll just think that they can't recall what movie it's from. I've seen that done dozens of times. ",

Then you won't have to worry about anything coming back to bite you later. Eventually, as technology increases, it will be harder and harder to escape copywriter infringement. Just be up front and you will be fine. ",
