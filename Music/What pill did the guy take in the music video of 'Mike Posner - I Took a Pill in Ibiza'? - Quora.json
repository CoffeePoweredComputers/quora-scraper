            "answer_text": "\u201c It was sort of a mystery pill. I was already under the influence of alcohol at the time. I had written a song with Avicii that week in Sweden called \u201cStay with You\u201d and he was playing in Ibiza so I said, \u2018I will just go there with you,\u2019 because I was already in Europe. I don\u2019t have like a regular 9\u20135 job \u2026 so might as well go to Ibiza, right? I had never been there before. So I went. We were at his show and I was drinking at the time. (I don\u2019t drink anymore, but I wasn\u2019t playing and I had no responsibilities except for enjoying myself so I was taking some vodka shots and probably some whisky if I know myself.) And I just sort of moseyed out into the audience to watch Avicii spin from their point of view. I would go back and forth between the backstage and the VIP area and then where the actual kids were. And most people didn't know who the f*** I was in Ibiza except for this one guy who recognized me. He was like, 'Are you Mike Posner?' and he was all excited. He holds up this little bag of pills and is like, 'You want one?' And drunk Mike Posner was like, 'F*** it, yeah.' So I took one and I had never done that before, and I felt amazing. Then when I came down I felt 10 years older.\u201d \u2014\u2009Mike Posner explaining the inspiration for the song, August 2015. ",

            "answer_text": "I asked myself several time what pill it was, but there are many substances that can give you a great feeling but drop you badly at the end, and hence I would never take them. Seeing folks after festivals needing HTP or something to get their serotonin back up points to XTC. If there is a hung over feeling, sluggish, maybe acid.But the 10 year older feeling my guess was XTC. At least for a few hours he felt better about himself. He seems to have an issue with confidence.
