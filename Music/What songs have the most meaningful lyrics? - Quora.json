            "answer_text": "In recent times, when lyrics like, \u201cthen she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt\u201d exist; songs by Troye Sivan have some really meaningful lyrics. The 22-year-old Australian singer writes his own songs along with Alex Hope and a few others. Take any song from his debut EP to his latest track, you'll find some really deep lyrics which are not just enjoyable but also make you ponder over them for a good duration of time. His every song is a quest for those who enjoy finding what the lyrics actually mean. But for me, this one from his third EP, 'Fun' is one of his most lyrically outstanding song. Here it is. Well, don't you want to see the world, boyAll the countries and their stars, boyJust don't look them in the eyes, boyYou just gotta' take their lives, boyLet me take you for a drive, boyOh, I swear you'll feel alive, boy It's quite a general perception that this song is about having fun with your friends. But, no, this song speaks how glorious wars are thought to be. And how young boys are trained to feel patriotic towards their motherland while they kill people particularly in the Middle East. All you gotta' do is trust that I'm being trueAnd do it for the people who love you These lines clearly justify that the young new soldiers are made to trust their leaders that killing a thousand other people just in the name of protecting your own people, your loved ones, isn't a thing to be ashamed of. They are told to let go of all the doubts and do it for their country. Let's go have funYou and me in the old jeepRidin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seatFun, you and me in the Middle EastShootin' at rocks bullets cockedIn the mid-day sun These lines are conflicting. Troye is trying to say that wars are anything besides fun. These lines are a mockery of how countries, particularly, Israel and Palestine are brainwashing young boys into becoming soldiers. Listen to what I tell youYou'll see, my sonNow you know what you gotta doLet's go have fun The word \u2018son' itself describes how young and immature the boy is to percept the realities of a war and the harsh consequences of it. The leader is mending his mind to think killing his enemies is a glorious duty for his country. When you're standing on the line, boyDon't go looking for goodbye, boyYeah, you gotta set them free, boy'Cause you know that's what they need, boyYeah, you're gonna make them proud, boy'Til they put you in the ground, boy The recruit is told that no matter how many deaths of fellow soldiers he face, he has to be focused on killing more on the other side. That's the ultimate revenge. Setting the local public free and bringing democracy is helping them towards a better future. He is brainwashed that he's actually helping the people he shoots. He's told that even if he dies, he should be content that all his loved ones will be proud of him for his services. The song was written when Troye was 18. So that pretty much sums it all, I guess.

Like a Rolling Stone, Bob Dylan (from Highway 61 Revisited)Once upon a time you dressed so fineYou threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you ?People'd call, say, \"Beware doll, you're bound to fall\"You thought they were all kiddin' youYou used to laugh aboutEverybody that was hangin' outNow you don't talk so loudNow you don't seem so proudAbout having to be scrounging for your next meal. (chorus)How does it feelHow does it feelTo be without a homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone ? You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss LonelyBut you know you only used to get juiced in itAnd nobody has ever taught you how to live on the streetAnd now you find out you're gonna have to get used to itYou said you'd never compromiseWith the mystery tramp, but know you realizeHe's not selling any alibisAs you stare into the vacuum of his eyesAnd say do you want to make a deal?  [chorus] You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clownsWhen they all come down and did tricks for youYou never understood that it ain't no goodYou shouldn't let other people get your kicks for youYou used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomatWho carried on his shoulder a Siamese catAin't it hard when you discover thatHe really wasn't where it's atAfter he took from you everything he could steal. [chorus] Princess on the steeple and all the pretty peopleThey're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it madeExchanging all precious gifts But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babeYou used to be so amusedAt Napoleon in rags and the language that he usedGo to him now, he calls you, you can't refuseWhen you got nothing, you got nothing to loseYou're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal. [chorus] ==============================================Everybody Knows, Leonard Cohen (from I'm Your Man)Everybody knows that the dice are loaded Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed Everybody knows that the war is over Everybody knows the good guys lost Everybody knows the fight was fixed The poor stay poor, the rich get rich That's how it goes Everybody knows  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking Everybody knows that the captain lied Everybody got this broken feeling Like their father or their dog just died Everybody talking to their pockets Everybody wants a box of chocolates And a long stem rose Everybody knows  Everybody knows that you love me baby Everybody knows that you really do Everybody knows that you've been faithful Ah give or take a night or two Everybody knows you've been discreet But there were so many people you just had to meet Without your clothes And everybody knows  Everybody knows, everybody knows That's how it goes Everybody knows  Everybody knows, everybody knows That's how it goes Everybody knows  And everybody knows that it's now or never Everybody knows that it's me or you And everybody knows that you live forever Ah when you've done a line or two Everybody knows the deal is rotten Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton For your ribbons and bows And everybody knows  And everybody knows that the Plague is coming Everybody knows that it's moving fast Everybody knows that the naked man and woman Are just a shining artifact of the past Everybody knows the scene is dead But there's gonna be a meter on your bed That will disclose What everybody knows  And everybody knows that you're in trouble Everybody knows what you've been through From the bloody cross on top of Calvary To the beach of Malibu Everybody knows it's coming apart Take one last look at this Sacred Heart Before it blows And everybody knows  Everybody knows, everybody knows That's how it goes Everybody knows  Oh everybody knows, everybody knows That's how it goes Everybody knows  Everybody knows  ==============================================Fucking Hostile, Pantera (Vulgar Display of Power)Almost every day I see the same face On broken picture tube It fits the attitude If you could see yourself You put you on a shelf Your verbal masturbate Promise to nauseate Today I'll play the part of non-parent Not make a hundred rules For you to know about yourself Not lie and make you believe What's evil is making love and making friends and meeting God you're own way The right way  (Chorus)  To see To bleed Cannot be taught In turn You're making us Ohhhh Fucking hostile  We stand alone  The truth in right and wrong The boundaries of the law You seem to miss the point Arresting for a joint? You seem to wonder why Hundreds of people die You're writing tickets man My mom got jumped -- they ran! Now I'll play a public servant  To serve and protect By the law and the state I'd bust the punks That rape steal and murder And leave you be If you crossed me I'd shake your hand like a man Not a god  (Chorus)  Come meet your maker, boy Some things you can't enjoy Because of heaven/hell A fucking wives' tale They put it in your head Then put you in your bed He's watching say your prayers Cause God is everywhere Now I'll play a man learning priesthood Who's about to take the ultimate test in life I'd question things because I am human And call NO ONE my father who's no closer than a stranger  I won't listen  To seeTo bleedCannot be taughtIn turnYou're making usFucking, fucking, fuckingFUCKING HOSTILE!
