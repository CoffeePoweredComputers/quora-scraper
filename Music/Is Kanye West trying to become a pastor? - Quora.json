            "answer_text": "Kanye is obviously unpredictable. If he is affiliated with Joel Osteen, my guess is he would not want to pastor an inner city church of 100. It would be go big or go home. But the pastoring business is not easy, even for the big name prosperity preachers we all (justifiably) like to criticize. You have to have a message, great organizational skills, and know how to stay on point, and keep your feet out of your mouth. I don\u2019t see that happening for West in the near future. But one never knows these days. Personally, I wish him well. Paul the Apostle wrote, \u201cwhether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached, and in that I do and will rejoice.\u201d ",
