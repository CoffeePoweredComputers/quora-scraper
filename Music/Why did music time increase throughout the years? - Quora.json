            "answer_text": "Can you please rephrase your question as it really doesn\u2019t make any sense. I simply don\u2019t understand the question as it is written. The only thing I can think of is why has there been a music explosion over the years and if that is what you are asking then I do have an answer for that. First of all when it got to a point where everyone had a TV then there were several variety shows on TV that included musical acts and eventually shows like American Bandstand and Soul Train where groups could showcase their music. Fast forward and then cable TV came along and with it networks like MTV and VH1 and that furthered the reach for music even further and also spawned the music video. Fast forward again to the internet and now you can reach people all over the world and now most music is either heard on the internet or downloaded from the internet. This has pretty much destroyed music store that once could be found all over the same way Pay Per View and Net Flix destroyed video stores. ",
