            "answer_text": "Crosby, Stills, and Nash was a supergroup \u2014 arguably the first supergroup in rock and roll history. When the group first came together in mid-1968, all three members were, or had been, members of established and popular rock bands: David Crosby was a member of the Byrds, Steven Stills was part of Buffalo Springfield, and Graham Nash belonged to the Hollies. All three played guitar, sang, and wrote songs for their respective bands (Steven Stills was also an accomplished keyboardist). According to legend, the three were at a party at Joni Mitchell\u2019s house, and when Crosby and Stills performed a new song that Stills had written, Nash joined in singing harmony. The three quickly realized that they sang beautifully and almost effortlessly together, and the genesis of the new band began. The three formed the core of the new band, and they released their first, self-titled album in the spring of 1969. Stills played the majority of the instruments on the album \u2014 lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar, and keyboards \u2014 and session musician Dallas Taylor added the drum parts. The album proved a massive hit, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash were established. Later that year, as the group began planning for a follow-up album, the band looked to hire a full-time keyboard player for the group. Stills wanted to enlist Steve Winwood, but he was too busy with other projects. So Stills turned to his former Buffalo Springfield bandmate Neil Young, who agreed to join. Interestingly, the new supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young shot to international prominence before they even entered the studio to record an album. They set off on a long, multi-city (and international) tour, that included a concert in Chicago\u2019s Auditorium theater and some rock festival that their manager talked them into performing at. That festival, of course, was Woodstock, and CSNY\u2019s set at Woodstock included a total of 16 songs, both acoustic and electric, and with and without Neil Young. The four finally entered the studio in late 1969 to record their first album, \u201cDeja Vu,\u201d which proved a massive hit, and included songs written by each of the four members, and featured lead vocals from each of the four members. It reached the #1 spot on the U.S. and U.K. charts, and spawned several singles, including their cover of Joni Mitchell\u2019s song, \u201cWoodstock.\u201d And after that, the magic essentially ended. The group would get back together for a brief tour in 1974, but with supreme talent comes supreme ego, and after two months, they again went their separate ways. Over a decade later, in 1988, they would re-unite to record \u201cAmerican Dream,\u201d a satirical look at the state of America and American politics. \u201cRolling Stone\u201d magazine damned it with faint praise by labeling it \u201cinteresting,\u201d and though it showed flashes of their formal brilliance \u2014 especially in the Neil Young song \u201cThis Old House\u201d \u2014 it was otherwise rather pedestrian. About a decade later, CSNY would release their final album (to date), \u201cLooking Forward.\u201d The critical reception was decidedly mixed, and the album sold miserably. All of this is by way of answering the question: CSN existed as a group both before and after Neil Young joined them, and Young\u2019s contributions to the group could best be called sporadic. Though Young\u2019s presence certainly contributed to their fame, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, their success was, by and large, not determined by Young\u2019s presence, and their successes and failures \u2014 fueled by massive clashes of ego and a heavy dollop of drugs and alcohol (and a prison sentence for Crosby \u2014 had little to do with Young. Neil Young, on the other hand, is the farthest thing from a \u201ccult artist.\u201d He achieved fame and success before joining CSN, and he achieved even greater fame and success on his own and with Crazy Horse.

            "answer_text": "Crosby, Stills and Nash\u2019s debut was such a large seller that we can safely assume that their popularity would have endured for some time with or without Young. What Young\u2019s arrival did was raise their public profile further and give new dimensions to the writing as well as a rockier edge. DEJA VU would certainly have been a different sounding record without Young. Young\u2019s own solo success was surely only a matter of time. AFTER THE GOLDRUSH was released on the back of his success with CSNY, but may well have been a huge seller regardless. Around this time, an album titled SWEET BABY JAMES by a hitherto unknown artist became huge. ",
