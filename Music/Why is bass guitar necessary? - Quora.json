            "answer_text": "Why is bass guitar necessary? First, it\u2019s not true that the bass sound \u201cis not usually heard.\u201d The closest truth to that is that there are times when you would not realize it\u2019s a bass that you are hearing, but if the bass stopped, you would notice a significant difference immediately. There are other times when the bass part is absolutely vital to the song. Power trio rock songs are based largely on blues. In both blues tunes and power trios\u2014such as Cream and the Jimi Hendrix bands\u2014you don\u2019t even have full music without a bass. Take this classic blues tune and try to imagine it without a bass:  Now listen to Jimi Hendrix play that amazing guitar intro to Machine Gun, from the Band of Gypsys album. Great intro. But could you really listen to that guitar alone for the full 12-minute jam without Billy Cox\u2019s bass behind him, giving him a foundation to play over? There is no way anyone could say the bass in this song is \u201cunnecessary.\u201d  Another example from classic rock is much of the music of The Who. Listen to the rock opera Tommy. Great guitar work, excellent drumming, but you\u2019ll notice that John Entwistle is playing an actual musical part most of the time, not just thumping on a bass line that sounds like the bass drum but with tone. Paul McCartney often played bass parts that were vital to the song too. Here is a summary of some of those bass parts:  It\u2019s true that there is music where the bass part is just thumping on a root-fifth and not adding much. But even then, you would sorely miss that low end if it weren\u2019t there. In fact, your ears would tire of the incessant jangly guitars without those low notes to provide contrast and a foundation. Another example is when the bass kicks in on the second verse of a song. Are you seriously telling me when that bass kicks in, you don\u2019t feel the song move ahead in a way that just would not be a complete song without that added bass line? Maybe the first verse sounded pretty good to you without that bass. But it would be monotonous without it, and you would likely tire of the song before it was over if you didn\u2019t have a full spectrum of sound, from low end to high. If you really think the bass is unnecessary, you\u2019re listening to the wrong music, the wrong bassists, or just not listening. ",

            "answer_text": " If you look at the chart, above, you see the response ranges of instruments and human voices. These are the ranges in which the instrument produces sound, including harmonics, not just the notes the instruments can play. Nothing but bass guitar goes right down to the bottom. In principle you could have a bass drum that went that far, and an orchestral drum could, but drum kits have tighter bass-skins for a more defined sound. If you have a bass guitar and a vocalist, you have covered all of the frequencies that an ordinary adult can hear. What\u2019s more, the range where the bass guitar is weaker are the important ranges for the human voice. When the bass guitar locks with the drums, you get the solid, powerful sound which is synonymous with rock and pop music. Guitars and keyboards can add flavour, texture and excitement to the sound, but the sound of rock is established by bass and drums working together. Advances in technology mean that some bands can do without bass guitar. If you have the bottom end of an acoustic guitar turned up, and a good microphone on the kick drum, you can cover everything down to 64 Hz. This won\u2019t give the big sound of rock, but in many environments it will be fine. The White Stripes do this, as do many garage bands. However, bass notes develop over greater distances than treble notes, and if you play them too quickly, they get muddled up in the room reverb. Bass guitar is about playing a few notes with absolute perfection, rather than a lot of notes. The bassist should try to create repeating motifs which can work throughout the song, as this engages physically with listeners or dancers in a way which interrupted bass cannot. These need to be simple and consistent. When I\u2019ve been asked to listen to a band to give advice, the issue (which is why they asked for advice) is more often bad bass than anything else. Guitarists playing bass don\u2019t usually get the simple, consistent method right\u2014they want to embellish and play across the rhythm to make it more exciting. Guys on the PA often turn the bass down. On one occasion we found that the main PA speakers had been switched to upper only mode for use with subwoofers\u2014but there were no subwoofers. Inexperienced PA users leave the -100db reduction switched on, because they\u2019ve heard it is \u2018better\u2019 for vocalists and guitars. ",
