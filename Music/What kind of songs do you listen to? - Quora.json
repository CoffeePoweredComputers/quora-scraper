I also do enjoy some flavors of pop (Christina Perri, Jem, Imagine Dragons, Melanie Martinez, Weyes Blood), Latin pop (Juanes, Cafe Tacvba, Carla Morrison) and I love classical music (Chopin, Debussy, etc) especially when I'm playing it.

            "answer_text": "I tend to listen to a lot of music that sounds like the Beatles. There is a whole subgenre of independent music that is Beatlesque, and most of it is unknown to the general public. If you\u2019re interested in the Beatles sound, I\u2019d recommend Jellyfish, Mike Viola and the Candy Butchers, the Nines, Susanna Hoffs, Bleu, Jason Falkner and David Myhr. Of course, power pop overlaps some here, but the artists I\u2019ve mentioned tend to be a little more McCartney than Lennon - i.e., lighter with fewer power chords. Other than that, I still listen to 80s music. I grew up in a rural area so I missed out on the whole post-punk/college radio movement. I still have a lot to cover. ",

In Electronic - I really like Brazilian Bass, a different style of deep house. This style is very characteristic and famous in Brazil, hence the name. Song examples:   In Rock: I am into to the classics, but I hate heavy rock. All for the chill rock. Examples:   In Jazz: Brazil has some great music. And probably on top of the ladder comes Bossa Nova. I am not sure if you can call Bossa Nova a sub genre of jazz, I consider it it\u2019s own genre, but some people find it easier to relate to a known style such as jazz. Examples:   Hope you like them! ",

I mean it's not like if you don't understand the language or their culture it becomes shit. Anyway, So honestly I do not listen to much of K-Pop except BTS. Answering the question, I listen to songs that make me happy, not emotional. I listen to songs that make me love me and not someone else. I listen to songs that make me keep my eyes open and appreciate my surrounding, even the wall, not making me close my eyes and think of the past memories. Of course a part of the fandom are toxic and I get it if you hate K-pop bcoz of their fandom. But honestly every fandom has some toxic fans and since K-pop has a huge fandom, naturally the numbers are more. But the songs have really amazing lyrics, all deep and meaningful. I listen to such songs. Apart from BTS there's another song that's my kind \u201cFight song\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "A very interesting question! I see answers here that approach the matter from totally different perspectives. For example, one put it in terms of where he found the songs. So I may as well put forth yet another view: These days, I\u2019m thinking that my feelings toward songs have less to do with what I like, and are more about what I hate. Hate is a strong word, and my use of it here is fully intentional. There is music I really do hate, and this reflects the way I\u2019m recently encountering thinking that I hate in all of life, as I explore the world of ideas more widely. You may find this mysterious. I wish I could clarify. I\u2019d like to give examples. But now I\u2019m going to say something that may frustrate you. I\u2019m going to say I\u2019m going to avoid examples. For now. That\u2019s because this is breaking news in my life, and if I were to tell you more specifics, I might be saying things that I\u2019d have to walk back, just a little farther on. Sorry, but I\u2019ll just have to leave it at that for now. Yes, there is lots of music I do listen to because I really do like it, and usually for quite light-hearted reasons. In fact, some of it is frankly sappy stuff. I know it\u2019s only rock and roll, but I like it\u2026Those tastes of mine have really not changed that much since, oh, age 20 at the latest, and mostly much earlier than that. But then there are those truly awful songs that say things I seriously hate\u2026 ",

One of the best movie of Bollywood!) 2. Yu hi nhi tujhpe dil ae fida hai( I am biggest fan of Arijit ) 3. Le aiha bengalia se dawaiya, devar kari ghaat and many more( selected Bhojpuri songs) 4. Fifth Harmony, Clean Bandit songs. 5. Derni\u00e8re danse ( one of the most famous song on tiktok sung by artist named indila) 6. Bhaag bhaag sher aaya, kadak ban, move, mercy (I am raftaar, honey badshah, bantai fan) 7.
