            "answer_text": "I started on violin, so fretless bass was not an alien concept to me. (Different fingering obviously.) Even so, I have two fretless basses and 6 fretted and I use the fretless perhaps 15% of the time. There is an initial challenge in playing a fretless instrument but consider all the high school kids who play a stringed instrument in the orchestra. It\u2019s hardly impossible, even for a person with average talent and time to devote to it. The bigger issue is what and where you\u2019re considering playing. Fretless isn\u2019t limited to Jazz and Fusion only, but it is relatively rare in pop and rock and at least as rare in country. You might use it in Latin music, but I mostly see double basses, at least in Latin Jazz. I\u2019ve showed up at rock sessions with a fretless and been told to put it back in the case. If I don\u2019t have a fretted with me (I always do) please leave. I\u2019ve found that a lot of hard core rock/Metal types don\u2019t like (what they perceive to be) the sound at all. Interestingly, these are often the same people who tell you to put the 5 and 6 string bass away. That is to say: genres where the \u201clead guitarist\u201d and singer are the entire show. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t play hard rock with a fretless \u2014 see videos of Jack Bruce for that. He puts a fretless Gibson to great use. (In fact, that\u2019s why I got one many years ago.) You can also, as another poster says, not have that buzzy sound often associated with fretless as \u201cthe\u201d fretless sound. Of course you can always create your own sound. Master it, find the right people to play with and there you go. My conclusion: if you know what you\u2019re going for and have considered the limits, by all means start with fretless. On the other hand, if you\u2019re not sure, start with a fretted bass. As someone remarked, and I\u2019m inclined to agree, you can probably show up almost anywhere with a stock Fender (fretted) P-Bass and fit in. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone would instinctively say NO after reading this question. For an amateur bassist, talk about playing fretless is high level stuff, names like Jaco, Alain Caron and Steve Bailey start popping in your head. And you start thinking about how fretless feats are out of your league and expertise. But if you think hard for a while after reading this question, learning a fretless bass is not that difficult for a beginner. To a beginner, learning to play the bass (fretless or not) is gonna be a hard task anyway. A beginner should begin fretless if they like the sound and start with a lined fretless bass. I think, It is more difficult for established fretted bass players to switch to fretless, they would have to redo their fretting hand technique, which (though not impossible) is a hard task. I struggle with the same but don\u2019t plan to give up any time soon. ",
