            "answer_text": "To get repost your own track there\u2019re many way to excute it. I\u2019ll share some tips for you to get many reposts at below. I think it\u2019s safe and fast!  1. Buy SoundCloud Plays, Repost. Getting your tracks played more is essential for drawing new followers. People are inclined to listen to your tracks if they see plenty of other people listening. An effective way to achieve that boost is to purchase SoundCloud plays. There are many providers available online that offer different plays packages. Some providers can deliver 1000 plays for as low as $3.5, see our reviews of the top providers to find the best deal for you. Carefully research each provider before purchasing SoundCloud plays. Go beyond the prices and look into the quality of other services they have. You should also consider the additional services they offer, like followers and likes. By the way, i'll share you a company that i'm using to buy plays and other services because they have event Buy 1 Get 1 Free. I bought many plays of them and nothing any matters hapenning. I think it's the best provider to refer. 2. Comment on related SoundCloud tracks Connecting with other SoundCloud artists within your niche is an effective way to build a network for attracting more followers. Commenting on their tracks is one of the easiest ways to do this. It also makes you more visible to other artists\u2019 listeners, drawing them to your tracks. The key to making this strategy effective is leaving high-quality comments that would lead to a conversation between you and the track\u2019s owner and fans. Feel free to comment about their track\u2019s technical aspects or other topics that would be of interest to them. Do it in a constructive manner to leave a positive impression and encourage them to respond. Once you have established an ongoing conversation with other artists and their audience, you will inevitably draw them to your own music. When directing them back to your tracks, make the action a part of your conversation. You can, for instance, present your tracks as a reference for them. This encourages them to see what you offer. 3. Connect with bloggers Reaching out to music bloggers can increase the visibility of your music outside of SoundCloud and attract new followers. There are plenty of blogs out there that cater to your specific genre. These blogs are often on the lookout for new acts to feature, giving you a good opportunity to catch their attention. Talking to vloggers is just as important: When submitting your music to blogs, prepare a good pitch for it. Talk about any interesting stories behind your tracks or aspects of your music in general. This will make you stand out from other submissions that the blogger is reviewing. Having an impressive SoundCloud page is also important since you will be linking back to it in your pitch. Put your best tracks on the front of your profile for the blogger\u2019s benefit. You can also purchase some followers to boost your page\u2019s prominence and create a better initial impression on them. 4. Post on music forums and Subreddits While social media is the dominant online promotional channel for musicians nowadays, forums are still invaluable for drawing new SoundCloud followers. Reddit, in particular, remains a popular place for people to find new artists to follow. The site has dozens of active music subreddits, including one dedicated to SoundCloud. Before submitting your tracks to any forum, familiarize yourself with their posting rules. You also don\u2019t want your link posts to look spammy. Instead of just dropping your SoundCloud link, provide some context around it. You can talk about the inspirations behind the track or its technical aspects. This serves to pique readers\u2019 interest and get them to click the link. As it is with social media, engaging with other forum members is essential for making your SoundCloud page and tracks more visible. On Reddit, for example, actively responding to comments can increase your upvotes and place your posts higher in the post lists. Keep your engagements genuine and interesting to turn these upvotes into an actual following. 5. Connect with influencers If you are promoting your SoundCloud page and tracks on Twitter, getting influencers to tweet your links will give you a big boost. One way to employ these influencers is through sponsored tweets. Here, you pay influencers to recommend you music to their followers. Sponsored tweet campaigns vary in cost depending on the popularity of the influencer and the scale of the campaign. To get the most out of sponsored tweets, you should have the right influencers. Look at how passionate they are about the kind of music you have. This will tell you how effective they are at promoting your music to their followers. Additionally, this can give you an idea of how receptive their followers will be to your tracks. 6. Make a music video Creating music videos is always an effective means of drawing attention to your SoundCloud tracks. Use your videos to cross-promote your Soundcloud page on other social media sites by adding a link back to your profile, or the featured track. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some ways. The fast way is to use a soundcloud scheduling tool to auto repost your own tracks, a good soundcloud bot should be safe to use and can effectively increase streams. And, fortunately, I have found such a bot, the one I consider as my best SoundCloud bot. The software has an amazing feature that schedules any tasks to automate. This feature allows the user to automatically schedule reposts by selecting a track link, a date to start, accounts to use, un-repost after a certain amount of hours, comment anything at a random time on the track and like the track all at the same time automatically. You can take a screenshot of of the page as either proof or as a reminder of how you had it set up. You can use our default template or create your own template(s). The stream tool makes your music easier to hear than other music. From sharing tracks, to initializing interactions with other users, to finding users who are interested in your music style. It brings you real followers, real likes, real comments, real scripts and real reprints. ",
