            "answer_text": "Yamaha Saluto is an attempt by the company to woo middle class buyers. Yamaha Saluto 125 is ofcourse better than than its 110cc version. Look wise the Yamaha saluto 125 cc offers racing patterns and stylish fuel tank panels and 4 different colour combinations. On the other hand Yamaha saluto rx110 is a workhorse for daily commute and traffic conditions. It also costs around Rs15k less than Saluto 125. If power and looks are the concern, better go for Saluto 125 and if mileage and price is the concern Saluto Rx110 is preferable ",

            "answer_text": "If you ride in city saluto Rx is what is required.not suited for long rides.82kmpl mileage. if you ride in city , highway some long rides go for saluto 125 remember.saluto 125 has got 78kmpl it is always better to have two motorcycles one for city riding one for long and highway rides .The Price difference between the two saluto is merely \u20b910000 both bikes are better than hero and Honda bikes with exceptional mileage .Hero and Honda maximum mileage is 74kmpl .TVs radeon gives 69kmpl.so Yamaha saluto is worth considering provided you choose the correct model . Blue core technology is better than Honda HET so forget Honda ,hero,TVS. Bajaj platina gives good mileages 80kmpl but I would avoid it due to quality and reliability issues.. so choose your variant all the best ",
