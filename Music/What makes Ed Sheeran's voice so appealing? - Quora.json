            "answer_text": "To me, what makes Ed Sheeran appealing as a singer is not merely how nice his voice sounds, but also how it relatively sounds much rawer and more passionate compared to most extremely manufactured and overproduced pop music nowadays. Ed also needs no Auto-Tune to be able to sing really well, which ultimately makes his music a lot more perfect in all its imperfections, and even if there are traces of pitch correction, it is highly minimal. At the same time, Ed is not a classical or highly trained singer but his fantastic musicianship and songwriting makes him a really solid and diverse artist. You want groovy tunes that you can dance along to? Check out Sing and You Need Me, I Don\u2019t Need You. You want some ballads? Photograph and Lego House give you that. Cheesy love songs with a huge dose of melancholic strain? Listen to Thinking Out Loud, which in my opinion is one of the best love tunes written in the past decade. These details, to me, are really what made his voice extremely appealing, and he definitely deserves the fame that he has obtained as a singer, having paid his dues as both a singer-songwriter and performer.

Raspy and it\u2019s not even smooth but he\u2019s always on pitch. His voice is the sound of a country side breeze. It\u2019s cool and groovy like a fast jazz music with some mixed of blues. Emotions behind it. Every lyric. Every residue of line. ",
