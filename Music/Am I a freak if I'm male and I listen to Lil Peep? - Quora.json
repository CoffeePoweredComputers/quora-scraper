I know that PROMANTIC seems significantly inspired by Peep and his good friend Bexey. Everyone has their own music preference, so if you like Peep, then you\u2019re not a freak. You shouldn\u2019t have to think that if the music your listening makes you happy my guy. So to sum it all up, guys who listen to Lil Peep should be protected, as they are amazing specimen who have wonderful taste in music. ",

The music is ok but the lyrics are vulgar, and cynical, if you want to hear that listen, it is an alternative to the mainstream yea too freaky for me.
