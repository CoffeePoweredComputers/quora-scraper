            "answer_text": "There are several answers to this question.  1) No symphony is hard to conduct because the conductor makes no sound---so how can anything be considered \"right\" or \"wrong\"? If the solo flute flubs an entrance, lots of people might sit up and say, \"wait, what??\" And if the conductor gives a cue in the wrong place, and the orchestra players respond to it, the audience usually blames it on the performers, not the conductor. The maxim in orchestras is: \"Play well and the conductor gets the credit; play badly and the orchestra gets blamed.\"  2) Every symphony is hard to conduct if you do it well. In the same way that singing a simple melody is very, very difficult, conducting a transparent piece like any of Mozart's symphonies, requires great attention to detail from everyone on onstage. Conducting Rite of Spring, as Bali Sani suggested, is actually not as hard as it seems, because any orchestra that can play it well has probably performed it a lot and doesn't need much from the conductor to sound good. Of course if you're a newbie conductor, and teaching this piece to a student orchestra, well, yes, then it's all uphill.  3) Any symphony that is being premiered is very difficult to conduct. We all know how Beethoven's 5th sounds, but what does Composer X's new work sound like? What is this newly-invented notation? Where does the orchestra need the conductor's  help? Where does the conductor need to get out of the way? It's a rare conductor who can absorb all the nuances of a brand new piece of music and help the orchestra get through it in limited rehearsal time. Leonard Slatkin excels at that. ",
