She did. Some of you younger folks may not realize or understand what high regard so many artists hold Iggy Pop. He deserves it. The only other example that comes to mind is Paul Stanley giving props to the fans\u2026\u201cI WANNA TELL YOU\u2026YOU\u2019VE BEEN A DYNAMITE AUDIENCE AND YOU DESERVE TO GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE\u2026LET\u2019S GO!\u201d ",

Personally, I love when bands do cover tunes. Especially if they change it up a little bit and don't play it the exact way it was written note 4 note. It's really great to hear a band put its own take on a song you like. ",
