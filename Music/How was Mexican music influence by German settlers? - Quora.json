            "answer_text": "Not much by German settlers but by the Spanish that conquered the indians. Who listen to new music and experimented with european instruments to produce and evolve in their own style as they developed different genres in mexican music. The music patterns and rhythms are similar in certain mexican genres, to the german, the reason mainly being the exposition to new instruments and therefore rhythms and styles as the european brought them into America. M\u00e9xico has a m\u00e9dium to large amount of musicians and composers, all with different styles, lifetime and experiences. In each  their own, traveling and exposition for various reasons to these instruments and rhythms would be the answer. ",
