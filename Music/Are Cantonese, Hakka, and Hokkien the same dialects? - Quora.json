            "answer_text": "I may say no. I speak both Cantonese and Hokkien, but I can only understand a little bit of Hakka , which means we use the similar grammar . Basically, Cantonese, Hakka, and Hokkien are Chinese, but we can speak Mandarin Chinese with the people when travelling to different parts of China. As most of them can understand Mandarin Chinese, you dont need to worry about language issue if you know Mandarin Chinese. In China, Mandarin Chinese is a mainly used language. It\u2019s pretty normal that most of the people from different areas speak Mandarin Chinese their own accents. But Chinese consists of 56 languages/dialects from different Peoples that are from different parts of China. ",

You can check their iso in the following link, if they are with the same langauge iso code, then quite likely they have different iso code.

Cantonese originates from Guangdong province in China, while Hokkien originates from Fujian province and Hakka from Northern/Central China (before migrating to Southeast China). They all have many differences in pronunciation, grammar and even writing (I know for a fact that Cantonese has some dialect-specific characters, not too certain about Hokkien/Hakka but if they did I wouldn\u2019t be surprised).
