            "answer_text": "Well, that was their tagline. And the fact that they had a tagline says much about the band. Not very punk, right? I really don\u2019t think the legacy of The Clash has aged all that well. Muiris Mac Cartaine gives a really nice summary of who they were, and what they stood for, in her answer to this question. Emerging from the punk scene in the U.K., they broadened into ska, reggae, dub, and funk. They were political activists, with leader Joe Strummer and manager Bernie Rhodes socialists. Rhodes was very adept at creating and maintaining their image as outsiders and agitators, and Strummer a passionate and charismatic voice, and they found a wonderful political foil in Margaret Thatcher. And a sympathetic press to carry their message and praise their music. Musically, The Clash was inconsistent. Their early punk records featured great energy, but are mostly memorable for the politically charged lyrics (and yeah, I love I\u2019m So Bored with the USA and Tommy Gun). London Calling is their one great album, a mash-up of styles with many of their best songs (Clampdown and Guns of Brixton being two of them). Aside from some great individual tracks (e.g., Magnificent Seven, This is Radio Clash, Police on my Back), the rest of the catalogue doesn\u2019t hold up real well. And yes, I include the entirely of Combat Rock in that comment (aside from Know Your Rights and Straight to Hell). And I also note they did quite a few cover songs to fill out their records. As to their influence, in my mind their reputation has diminished over time. They were an early leader of London Punk, but certainly not in the league of the Sex Pistols. There are many songs of their peers that I prefer to listen to these days (give me The Damned\u2019s Neat Neat Neat every day over Tommy Gun). The fusion of world music styles was solid, but there were earlier originators (e.g., Talking Heads) and many bands that were consistently better at it. All I know is that I rarely pull out music from The Clash these days, and I was a big fan back in the day. I still listen to The Jam regularly, and remain inspired by the brilliant songwriting of Paul Weller \u2014 more and more, I see Paul Weller as the logical next step in songwriting from Ray Davies. Ultravox\u2019s Vienna still sounds amazing and groundbreaking, 40 years down the road. LA punk, from X, to the Minutemen, to Black Flag, still grabs my attention. As does 70s Bowie. The punk-plus-music dynamics of the Pixies in the late 80s. Hell, Van Halen\u2019s debut fused hard rock with punk energy, and remains wonderfully vital today. RIP, Ed. So, what remains of The Clash? One great album. A number of excellent individual songs, in a number of different styles. Bands that originated in the late 70s and early 80s that were inspired by the Clash, and improved upon them. And a whole lot of marketing hype. But broadly, they are a garage band version of The Police: huge deals back in their day, but nowhere near as important as they seemed at the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A  The Clash were different, they sought to make a difference to their young listeners amidst the high youth unemployment and social problems of the 70s. Their lyrics still ring true to this day but the only band that matters was just a polemic they used to make them stand out from the crowd.  The Clash are still picking up fans 40 years after their debut and matter to a select few in a way that other 70s corporate rock groups like Foreigner, ELP, the Eagles & (California era) Fleetwood Mac never will (Yeah l know they\u2019re all talented, great harmonies - Feck them). Their debut album is hard loud and fast and available in two versions the original UK & the amended US version. London Calling is one the greatest rock double albums but all their other albums have great tracks. They\u2019re far from the only band that matters but they are one of the few 70s bands that are still relevant today. While the Pistols were about nihilism and the Ramones celebrated teenage life, the Clash aimed higher and were about trying to empower people to change their world. That fecked up world still needs to be changed and the Clash are still a band that matters.
