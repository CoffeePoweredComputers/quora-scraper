            "answer_text": "Everyone will answer this question with a question, \u201cBetter in what way?\u201d Let\u2019s adjust the question a little bit. Who would have an easier time playing the other\u2019s music, a jazz guitarist or a rock guitarist? A lot of very popular rock songs are very easy to play on guitar. Rock and blues are the musical forms that get the most people to pick up the instrument in the first place. Songs as different as Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car,\u201d John Mellencamp\u2019s \u201cJack & Diane,\u201d and Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s \u201cCrazy Train\u201d all use the same chords (A, D, E). Any remotely competent jazz guitarist can play these songs. I imagine jazz has similarly simple songs. Certainly \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d if you consider it jazz, isn\u2019t harder than \u201cJack & Diane.\u201d The music diverges after that. A rhythm jazz guitarist has to master a lot more chord forms than your average rock guitar player. Rock\u2019s heavier distortion can make complex chords sound cacophonous, so power chords rule. Can a jazz player handle Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cIron Man?\u201d Yes. I\u2019d say that a successful jazz guitar player is better at guitar than a guitar player in a band like Nickelback. But when you get into the rarified air of the top musicians in the respective styles things change again. Could John McLoughlin create the \u201csoundscapes\u201d of acts like Radiohead or The Smashing Pumpkins? Maybe not. And at the same time, as much as I like their playing, Radiohead and Corgan can\u2019t do McLoughlin\u2019s job either. Can a jazz guitarist play Yngwie Malmsteen? No. Not that Al DiMeola can\u2019t play as fast as Yngwie - he probably can. But at this level of speed and complexity, does Al really know the Phrygian mode as well as Yngwie? How about his sweep picking? But that isn\u2019t to say Yngwie can play DiMeola either. Their skills probably converge on \u201cMediterranean Sundance\u201d and I\u2019d pay for that ticket. Consider Steve Vai. Can DiMeola play \u201cYankee Rose,\u201d \u201cShy Boy,\u201d \u201cWhispering a Prayer,\u201d or \u201cCall it Sleep?\u201d With practice, sure. But he\u2019d probably never be comfortable in it. The clip below is of Vai and DiMeola playing a DiMeola song. Here you see that while Vai can easily play the notes, he\u2019s still Steve Vai playing an Al DiMeola song, whammy bar and all. As far as I know, the two don\u2019t perform a Vai song together but I\u2019d love to hear them together on \u201cThe Attitude Song.\u201d  Does Eddie Van Halen sound like he\u2019s struggling with jazz chords and voicing in Big Bad Bill (with his father btw)?  And how fun would it be for EVH to sit in on a track like Russell Malone\u2019s below - no distortion. Would he hit a home run? No. Like Al DiMeola playing Steve Vai, or Steve Vai playing Al DiMeola, this isn\u2019t what he does. The vocabulary is different and EVH could not rely on familiar licks and runs. But Van Halen is a very underrated rhythm player who grew up around his father\u2019s jazz musician friends - hearing him sit in with Malone would be a lot of fun.  At the same time, I\u2019m not sure how many jazz guitarists could pull off \u201cCathedral,\u201d \u201cSpanish Fly,\u201d or even \u201cLittle Guitars (intro).\u201d After posting my original answer I stumbled on this clip of GE Smith (SNL Orchestra) talking about the time EVH sat in on the show. This is Eddie playing nearly impromptu jazz (blues). 30 Years Ago: Eddie Van Halen Jams on 'Saturday Night Live' And we haven\u2019t talked about other shredders like Paul Gilbert, Buckethead, and Joe Satriani, players like Jeff Beck and Frank Zappa who really crossed boundaries, or a player like Alex Lifeson. So there you go: at the easiest end of the \u201cclassic songbook\u201d of each genre, rock is easier but not necessarily by much. In the middle, jazz is harder because the chord forms are much harder. But as you move up the complexity of each genre, what you find is phenomenal musicians who develop techniques, licks, and an \u201cear\u201d for their own genre and personal style. Some guys would have an easier time crossing over to the other style, but as a rule the jazz guitar player couldn\u2019t just walk into the best rock guitar setting and dominate. A final thought: regardless of genre, Ralph Macchio is clearly the greatest guitar player who ever lived\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026.. in my humble opinion, what makes a musician great is how they create a mood or convey a feeling with music. Our ancestors beat on drums, so music is already a part of everyone\u2019s creative background. After all isn\u2019t it creativity that separates us from all the other life on earth? Just thought I would include you drummers too. Jazz players use complex chord structures often to create a scene so to speak. While a rock player will use more single note melodies. Rock guitarists use many more different timbres that jazz guitarists. I believe that the genius lies in the simplicity. It\u2019s easy to play fast, but most people can\u2019t comprehend all of those notes. Therefore, it has doesn\u2019t paint a picture as well as something simpler. Need proof? Beethoven\u2019s fifth symphony. That beginning is something almost everyone has heard before, and it to me it sounds sort of dark. That is to say say, a sunny day family picnic isn\u2019t what I think of when I hear it. So\u2026. if you look at the top 100 selling albums of all time, most of them are rock. To me that means more people identify with simpler melodies than complex ones. Not that complex melodies are easy or can\u2019t convey a feeling just as well. Just saying simple melodies appeal to more people than complex ones. 2 of the top 10 albums are Pink Floyd. The wall is number 3 (zep 4 is only a few albums ahead of it) and dark side of the moon is number 10. David Gilmour is all about very simple, slow melodies. Therefore, he appeals to the masses. Gilmour also plays \u201cnoise\u201d really well. He doesn\u2019t even need notes to convey a feeling. Just listen to \u201c\u201cone of these days\u201d or \u201ccareful with that axe Eugene\u201d Conclussion, one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever seen any guitar player do was when I saw someone use their fingers down the side of a classical guitar to make a galloping horse sound, including the Doppler affect. Didn\u2019t use any notes or even touch the strings. Pure genius. ",

            "answer_text": "Rock and Jazz have different goals. My neighbor once asked me over a backyard fire pit, \u201cwho was better Clapton or Hendrix?\u201d I chose not to finish a music degree as a trombone major because I didn\u2019t like the idea of music, or any other art, as a contest. Is Rembrandt better than Van Gogh? I never describe guitar players with the athletic term \u201cfast\u201d. The answer to my neighbor is Clapton was better at stuff he practiced and so was Jimi. A comparison between jazz and rock guitar assumes the goals are the same. Rock music has been referred to as \u201c3 chords and an attitude\u201d. I would add to that the minor pentatonic scale. Literally millions of people on Youtube have adopted rock as their own because technically it is easy, repetitive and fun. Some rock players have advanced past this, but mostly still remain in familiar \u201cinside\u201d bluesy lick driven territory. The music is familiar, girls dance and the band gets paid. Eric Clapton mimicked earlier players and still does. Stevie Ray Vaughn was an awesome rock and blues guitarist but was nothing new IMO. While most rock guitarists are satisfied with rock, some get bored and want to expand. It is the same reason Bebop happened. Players in the swing bands got bored with repetitive swing music. Expanding means more harmonic colors, more exotic rhythms, more room for elaborate and personal melodic concepts. Jazz is a more cerebral discipline that requires more ear training, learning and practice. No one is ever finished learning jazz. To me jazz is more art form where rock is more performance. Rock players are lost trying to creatively play over changes and implying harmony with exotic scales because they have not developed the ears or vocabulary for it. At the same time I can\u2019t imagine any of the great jazz guitarists having the swagger and showmanship to play with the Rolling Stones. I don\u2019t think they compare. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to argue this endlessly with my jazz teacher in high school. I am a massive proponent of rock music and that man soured my interest in jazz from an early age. Jazz musicians can be great awesome people, but there is a certain tier of jazz musicians that consider jazz \u201cthe only music.\u201d This attitude is myopic to say the least. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Jazz is a bit of a dead language. It\u2019s not commonly played and is certainly not spread as much as rock or even country. When I listen to or play jazz, I feel like I\u2019m cave diving. Looking for the gems that I can bring back to my style and my playing. Brass tacks time, and here\u2019s what I hate to admit, if you give a jazz guitarist a rock lead sheet, and \u201crock equipment\u201d then they\u2019ll probably be able to play that music in a much shorter amount of time than the opposite. If you give a rock guitarist a jazz lead sheet and some \u201cjazz equipment\u201d than most rock guitarists will struggle a bit longer and it will take a bit more for them to get the jazz stuff down. Here\u2019s the thing, any great rock guitarist will take the time to study and learn some jazz. It\u2019s great stuff to learn because it will help your brain grow. I like to revisit \u201cThe Real Book\u201d from time to time, and if I spend a few hours playing through jazz sheets, I\u2019ll come out of it feeling more confidant about playing rock music. I have to introduce my big \u201chowever\u201d moment. The largest selling music in the United States is actually country music. Any serious jazz musician would scoff at that fact, and probably return to his snobbery, but therein lies the biggest problem of all. Musicians tend to get lost in studying and forget that music is about connecting to people. No matter how technically proficient an artist becomes, the bottom line for musicians is whether or not the audience is moved by the experience of a performance. For my money, I would rather be part of an AC/DC performance than see the worlds greatest jazz guitarist. Julian Lage, as amazing a guitarist as he is, often plays music that goes right over my head. So the question you\u2019ve asked is truly not as black and white as it may seem on the surface level. I hope this doesn\u2019t disparage anyone from following their heart. If you love jazz, you should play jazz, and likewise if you love rock. It never hurts to take the things you like most from many different genres and combine them, so I hope that anyone who reads this feels rejuvenated and delves into new music they haven\u2019t played before.

            "answer_text": "Yes, most jazz guitarists are better. That\u2019s because jazz is much harder to play. Jazz requires learning 100\u2019s, and sometimes even 1000\u2019s of chords, whereas in rock, you can get by with 3\u20135, and if you\u2019re a good player, 20\u201360, or a 100 at most. Many jazz chords are also hard to finger, you have to stretch your fingers all over the place, awkwardly, to finger the difficult chords, and that\u2019s why a lot of guitarists give up on learning to play jazz. There are some hard chords like that in rock music, but only a few, and most players who do that, or compose with those, know how to play jazz, and are borrowing a jazz chord. For example, George Harrison, and Eric Clapton, both have some difficult chords they use in their songs, but both of them have long fingers, and big hands, that can easily play those chords, and both studied jazz guitar playing, though they didn\u2019t try to become jazz players. Jazz is also far more complex, musically. A jazz song, whether it is a pop jazz standard, by Cole Porter, or someone from that pop jazz vocal era, can have 5\u201325 chords for every line of lyric sung, while most rock songs will only have 1\u20133. Progressive Rock songs tend to have a lot of chords, and are an exception, but most rock doesn\u2019t have that many chords, and country, bluegrass, the blues, etc, -all the pop song formats tend to have no more than 5\u201310 chords, per song to play, while a jazz pop vocal standard song could have 10\u201330. A more complex jazz composition, by John Coltrane, Mile Davis, Dizzy Gilepsie, etc., is going to have hundreds of chords in it, usually. There are exceptions, with some simple compositions, but they are the exceptions. To play jazz on guitar, you have to know all the hundreds of chords, and be able to do all the fingerings well, without buzzing, and stumbling, and you need to know how the jazz composition works, the music theory behind it, so you can keep up with the rest of the improvising ensemble you play with. You have to know all your scales well, to play your leads. That\u2019s a lot to know, and practice, whereas in rock, it\u2019s far simpler, and easier, to master playing rock music. I love rock, because the melodies can be beautiful, and a good guitar player can do all sorts of cool stuff, like varying the rhythms in the strumming, varying between arpeggios and chord strumming, and also using all sorts of effects on the electric guitar, and creating exciting tones and textures, through smart manipulation of your techniques. But as a guitar player, I can tell you that the skills involved just immediately make most jazz guitarists better on their instruments. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d There are accomplished guitarists in both genres, musicians who have studied music for years, have played every scale imaginable until their fingers bled, can compose masterpieces, perform complex pieces live flawlessly, and have 4.0 GPAs in Masters and Doctorate degrees. There are some in both genres who are brilliant musicians without ever taking lesson number one. And both genres have hacks who just happened to be in the right place at the right time with other compatible players who all have the right chemistry. I fall into the last category. While I have not attained commercial monetary success, I have been on the receiving end of many positive accolades from the local musicians I have played with, and also from some very well known San Francisco Bay Area musicians. I call myself the exception to the drummer rules: I show up to rehearsals, shows, and sessions on time and sober, and stay that way.I have quality gear and reliable transportation.I have never locked myself inside the van.And despite being very single for most of my adult life, I was never homeless, (except for only six months 12 years before taking up the drums at age 39, and immediately after a prolonged bout with cocaine, which I have not used in 30+ years.)Which brings me to an old joke: Q- What's the difference between a jazz guitarist and a rock guitarist? A- One plays 3000 chords in front of 3 fans while the other plays 3 chords in front of 3000 fans. And one for good measure: Q- What's the difference between a jazz musician and an extra large pizza? A- The pizza can feed a family of four. Rim shot! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are a guitarist taking guitar lessons and you are learning your favorite heavy metal guitar solos, you soon discover that some of them are easier than they look. Bending a string with the fingers or a tremolo bar isn\u2019t hard. A lot of solos are made up of various arpeggios, often played, say, four times, then moved up a note and played again. Once you are used to playing the riffs fast and clean, you can plug them into a lot of songs whether or not they have anything much to do with the melody. Even with bands like the Grateful Dead, a lot of that pretty soloing is primarily scales, and the amazing thing is the way the solos from the various players criss-cross. A lot of rock songs with astonishing solos use only a few chords and have pretty simple melodies. Many depend on various pedals and volume to impress people. Okay, I\u2019m talking to open-minded aspiring rockers here. Listen to how the long dead jazz guitarist Barney Kessel plays this eighty year old classic by George Gershwin, combining chords and single strings to create a beautiful solo.  Never heard of him? He was one of the top session men in The Wrecking Crew in L.A. in the sixties and seventies and played on a LOT of rock songs you love. You can buy that transcription for $2. If you sit down with it and devote yourself to learning it, and a bunch of other songs Leduc has transcribed, you will lean an immense amount about how guitars work. I\u2019m not saying you need to play this kind of music. But if you are ABLE to play like this, don\u2019t you think you will be able to create much more interesting solos in your own band, with the volume and distortion? Don\u2019t you think you will become a much better guitar player? Here\u2019s Kenny Burrell playing a Harry Warren tune from 1942. You can learn so much from playing this.  Remember that Clint Eastwood movie \u201cPlay Misty for Me\u201d? Here is Joe Pass playing \u201cMisty.\u201d Another great session man and jazz guitarist. He used to write a monthly column in \u201cGuitar Player.\u201d He uses a lot more scales in his solos than does Barney Kessel. He had a big influence on a few of the guitar gods from the eighties.  One of the most melodic of guitar solos (well, actually, three melodies, three solos, at once\u2014two lead guitars and a lead bass) in rock is found is the version of George Gershwin\u2019s \u201cSummertime\u201d played by Big Brother and the Hilding Company, from their great album \u201cCheap Thrills.\u201d (Janis Joplin sounds great, too, of course). Catch the solos at the beginning and in the middle.  Joe Pass\u2019s jazz solo is similarly melodic:  As guitarists, we can grow in a variety of directions. I spent years essentially playing the same basic chords with a few barre chords. Then I played fingerstyle blues. I never went toward classical. I wanted to learn jazz, but never managed it until recently. But I\u2019ve also been studying gypsy jazz, bossa nova, choro, Western swing, and a lot more. Expand your horizons. Learn wherever you can. For example, you might recall a band called The Doors. They had a song called \u201cSpanish Caravan\u201d that began with an exciting passage of flamenco guitar. It was the first flamenco I\u2019d ever heard, and it amazed me. I didn\u2019t study that, but it would have been fun. Spread your wings! Cross-pollinate! ",

If by \u2018better\u2019, you mean having more technical and instrumental skills and a greater repertoire of chords, scales, and improvisation ideas and techniques and melodic invention, jazz guitarists are probably without peer. If you mean the ability to perform solo without an accompanying orchestra or band and still play all the parts (rhythm, melody, accompaniment) simultaneously, then classical, jazz and some folk /fingerpicker players would be at the top (check out Joe Pass, Martin Taylor, and Tommy Emmanuel). If you are looking for rhythmic complexity, you would look for African, Art Rock and Jazz players to wow you. If you are looking for simplicity and expression, I\u2019d say its Blues players. If you like a lot of distortion and interesting sound processing and effects, then Pop and Rock players are your thing. But even there, you can\u2019t compare today\u2019s Rock musicians with Rock musicians from 30 even years ago, because modus operandi and priorities have changed. Personally, I don\u2019t think a discussion on \u2018what makes people feel something\u2019 comes into this. You would have to reframe the question. People respond to different music emotionally because they have developed their tastes and have had experiences, but that in itself doesn\u2019t validate a musician being better in terms of skill or even in terms of communicative ability. Taste and opinion never trump facts. Let\u2019s use the example of language: if a majority of adult people only respond to the most basic and fundamental stories that are written at a 6th grade level, you don\u2019t make the claim that the author must be a genius of storytelling - instead, you rightly express your concern that the population has lost something, a level of sophistication and critical thinking you expect them to have. In our society, we are able to observe an ever-decreasing capacity to have profound human interactions and experiences due to a dependency on digital technologies, and our musical experiences have not been left unscathed by this. Also, culture and subculture influences what is meaningful music to people. There\u2019s a well-known story of a missionary wanting to show Africans Beethoven\u2019s 9th symphony and he had them all gather around and started to play the phonogram. After a while, one by one, they got up and left. When questioned about their departure, they said that they were waiting for the music to start, but it never did. To the missionary, Beethoven was great music because it was his culture. ",

            "answer_text": "I sense a bit of musical snobbery in the posts I am seeing here, namely, because the music is \u201ccomplex\u201d, it is better. No, not true. I am a classically trained keyboardist. Classical music is very complicated. Many rock guitarists (the excellent ones) have been classically trained. People who say they are simply playing scales and then move up a fret or two and repeat are being dismissive. Yes, many guitarists are taught what is referred to as box patterns, and for this reason, many guitarists do sound the same. This is true for both rock AND jazz guitarists. The problem I have with jazz music is that a lot of it in my view is contrived, particularly chord structure and timings. I like well structured music. Well structured music holds up better throughout the piece. Jazz is too loose, and when you have some of those odd timings, I do not see any cohesiveness to the music. Sorry, I just don\u2019t. Listening to these clips, were really so annoying. It is actually considerably more difficult to improvise within a 4/4 timing than say 11/8. Again, when I see people dismissing that, it strikes me as musical snobbery. And I am sure there will be those who will accuse me of the same thing. So be it. I will say something that I am sure will rankle some. You can\u2019t be a good jazz player unless you have studied and studied well, classical music and theory. Classical gives the foundation to all. Satriani was mentioned, where it was stated he teaches jazz to his students. I like Satch a lot. He was first classically trained as was Steve Morse, Randy Rhoades, Ritchie Blackmore, Jan Akkerman, Steve Howe, Michael Schenker, Yngwie Malmsteen, Uli van Roth just to name a few. The reason why I prefer what rock guitarists do to what jazz guitarists do is one simple reason. Emotion. Jazz guitarists are simply too much of technicians. They play the notes, but there is no emoting. What\u2019s the point of music unless you play with feeling and get your listeners to feel something? Take someone like Al DiMeola - very technical player, but lacking in feeling. His playing does nothing for me. As to the rock guitarists mentioned here\u2026just remember, it was guys like Blackmore, Akkerman, Howe, Beck who laid the foundation for the guitarists of the 80s and 90s. As an example, Malmsteen said, that after seeing Blackmore playing Baroque runs and Bach in concert, that is what inspired his musical journey. Blackmore studied Bach. His playing is not simply pentatonic blues scales. They are classical and middle eastern scales, arpeggios. He invented the sweeping technique (like Steve Hackett invented tapping and hammer ons). Currently, Blackmore is playing wonderful acoustic guitar now, doing amazing technical things while enhancing the music. Akkerman followed the same path. Howe, basically played classical music throughout his career be it on acoustic or electric guitar. Just listen to his work in Yes. Rock music may have started out being simple (50s, early 60s), but became very complicated (prog rock anyone?). So, to say and imply only jazz is complicated, give me a break. It\u2019s that snobbery at work. Another point, sometimes the simplest music is the best. IMO, Toccata and Fugue in D minor is Bach\u2019s best piece of organ music. From a technical point of view, it is fairly easy to play. But, there is such grandeur in the piece, the harmonies are superb. Music does not have to be \u201cdifficult to play\u201d to make it great. That is a misconception I see a lot of out there. I will take guitarists such as the ones I mentioned over any jazz guitarist. They are technically skilled players with solid training and foundation who also play with emotion. Of course, this is all subjective. It all comes down to what one prefers. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer yes. Longer answer involves the comparison of languages. Let's say you brush up on your Spanish that you learned in High School for that trip to San Juan. You look at all your sentences and phrases and you feel confident you can get around with the locals. Well the truth is just because you can order a drink in Spanish or tell the taxi guy where you wanna go, you probably haven't worked on it long enough to be able to sit with Old man Javier at the local coffee shop and get deep about life. Same with Jazz. Eric Clapton sitting in with Wynton Marsalis is like the gringo trying to mix in up with the locals in San Juan\u2026 you really have to know the Jazz language to be able to work your way through complex chord changes. Rock, for the most part, consists of only a few forms .. I IV V, I vi ii V, etc they don't get too intricate.. and for solos the rock guitarist\u2019s go to is the minor pentatonic. In Jazz you Melodic Minor, half dimished, super locrian, etc So yes, for the most part, not all, but most Jazz guys are way better than rock guitarists for knowledge .. or language of music On the flip side MOST straight up jazz guys when asked to rock out or funk out they just can't do it. They're stuck in Wes World and you hear them try and they have zero feel for it.. again thats a language they don't understand ",

            "answer_text": "Depends. Sometimes Jazz guitarists are better in rock guitarist or even metal guitarists but sometimes many rock or metal guitarists are better than most jazz guitarists. But in general term of technique , speed and skills Jazz guitarists are better than rock guitarists in most cases but not way better. For example, Django Reinhardt in his time was one of the best guitarists and still is.  How he manages to play with two fingers is unbelievable. Guitar designer Les Paul is also known for his speed and technique,  Look at how he picks his guitar, how he changes his scales, he even used sweep picking while playing it. But many reock guitarists like Johnny Ramone have been good guitarists but not technical like jazz guitarists  He was known for his fast downpicking, high distortion uses and many palm-mute and power chords. But he\u2019s been a rhythm guitarist for most of his life. On the other hand guitarists like Ritchie Blackmore have been very technical, fast and skilled.  Ritchie Blackmore experimented with different genres. Rock, classical, blues etc. But we could say he is a rock guitarist. Pretty much guitarists like Joe Satriani are also very technical and skilled.  How he used whammy pedal, I don\u2019t think most jazz guitarists could do it. Conclusion: So, usually jazz guitarists are more technical, skilled, faster, I mean better than rock guitarists. But there are many skilled rock guitarists who can\u2019t be compared with jazz guitarists. ",

            "answer_text": "Jazz guitarists are guitarists who play jazz using an approach to chords, melodies, and improvised solo lines which is called jazz guitar playing. The guitar has fulfilled the roles of accompanist (rhythm guitar) and soloist in small and large ensembles and also as an unaccompanied solo instrument. As guitarists, we explore new and different styles of music in an effort to satisfy our curiosity, utilize our creativity, and improve our technique in the process. We\u2019ll compare the genres of rock and classical guitar in an effort to understand some of the foundation techniques that can inform our own playing. Now that we\u2019ve compared some fundamental differences (and a few similarities) between rock and classical guitar, some food for thought: There is no single instrumental technique that is objectively better than any other; rather, the value of a given technique can only be judged insofar as the technique achieves the aesthetic goal of the music. Thus, if a pick helps you create the sound that you\u2019re looking for, so be it. If you require finger style or hybrid picking to find your sound, then that is what you should use. The second one is that the audience for rock music is much, much larger than for jazz. That is an equally \u2018no duh\u2019 statement as far as I am concerned. I am a huge jazz fan, but aside from summer festivals with a bunch of groups, audiences that break into the \u2018thousands\u2019 are reserved for names like Metheny or Corea or a few others. The hybrid message is what seems to have spurred discussion. I have read through page after page micro-analyzing the monstrous complexity of rock music by tossing out one or two examples, saying that \u2018jazz is the same\u2019 based on the written chords being similar to rock music, and so on. It is stunning the amount of anguish, energy, passion and angst generated by what amounts to a humorous little quip on a graphic. ",

            "answer_text": "I read an interview back in the 90\u2019s of an American jazz guitarist. He was asked about what he thought of Van Halen, Satriani, Vai, and his answer struck me : \u201cthese guys sound good, it\u2019s a pity they don\u2019t play anything complicated\u201d Edit : it was Jimmy Gourley. This was an interview for a French magazine, can\u2019t remember if it was Jazz Hot or Jazz mag\u2019 And I remember that my guitarist friends were shocked and went on \u201cwho does he think he is?\u201d, \u201cthat old fart couldn\u2019t bend a note if he wanted to\u201d and so on. But he was right : he was not talking about difficulty, but about complexity. Rock music is in essence relatively simple, harmonically and rhythmically ; it is the energy that counts and make it alive. The guys I mentioned above added their fair share of virtuosity, but they didn\u2019t make their music more complex - and they were certainly right, because they have an audience. If they started jamming on Donna Lee or Along came Betty, they\u2019ll quickly lose a part of their aura\u2026 The fun fact is that a lot of them can play jazz. A guy like Satriani can of course play jazz, he learnt it and teaches it! In the end, I don\u2019t think it is that important. I remember a friend of mine who was a classical guitarist and regularly played in jazz bands. He certainly stuck out, and was not exactly appreciated. It was not due to his playing, that was evidently flawless and enough swinging : it was because of his attitude ; he always seemed to show some disdain for his fellow musicians. It was not about them, it was about the music. He wasn\u2019t even conscious about that. Well, back to the attitude : French (crazy) guitarist Christophe Godin explains the difference between a jazz guitarist and a rock guitarist\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "If your question was \u201cIs there more to learn to become a Jazz guitarist than a Rock guitarist\u201d I would say yes, there is. We don\u2019t need to learn all those inversions and extensions to improvise. We can get away with a Pentatonic. Does that mean Jazz guitar players are better? No. Here are some reasons why. Just because Rock guitar players don\u2019t need to learn minor 11th chords, it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t know them - or could learn them in a very short time if they needed them. What really makes a difference is the individual player not the genre.Difficult and better are not the same thing. I admit, I can\u2019t improvise when the key keeps changing, the meter is odd and the extensions added to the chords keep blurring the key, if there actually is one.How the hell do Jazz players do that? Yet, I wouldn\u2019t consider myself inferior to someone who can do this in anyway. I didn\u2019t learn those things because I have what I need to express myself. It would be great if I could improvise like a Jazz guitarist, but since it doesn\u2019t fulfill my goals I\u2019m not putting in the time. 3. The relative simplicity of the music is usually compensated for by other things such as technical complexity. Once again this depends on the individual player. Ever heard Ynwie Malmsteen or Steve Vai? Rock can get as difficult as that. Bottom line, you need more musical knowledge to play Jazz, but the variations within both Jazz and Rock (sub-genres) are huge, and the difference between each individual player are even larger. ",

            "answer_text": "Though I shudder at comparisons between players, in the broader (stereotyping) world of music, a jazz player of any instrument will usually be the more . . . \u2018accomplished\u2019 musician, due to the necessity of studying music theory. True, there are jazz \u201cear\u201d players who don\u2019t bother, but once someone asks you to play a 13th chord, you better know what it is. But guitar is an exception to most rules. Learning music on guitar is a little like trying to learn English using crossword puzzles. It is difficult to make sense of the linear structure of theory when you have to deal with frets running one way and strings running the other. So, at times, a jazz guitarist will appear that hasn\u2019t a clue what the theory behind their music is, but not often. A guitarist often starts with chord patterns printed over the melody line of what is called a \u201clead sheet.\u201d When you hit a chord you don\u2019t know, you figure it out and practice it until you can play it smoothly in the song. Same thing happens in jazz, but then you will want to move up with the big boys. That\u2019s when the manuscript score paper comes out and before you know it, you\u2019re slogging through the circle of fifths or learning why you might want to sharp the 11th in that chord there, buster. So, maybe not in terms of technical prowess, but in the musical knowledge department, I would venture that MOST jazz guitarist are better musicians that many rock guitarists. That being said, it is rumored that the players in KISS all have music degrees and figured out how to make a monster rock band and a lot of money. The letters in their name form the anagram that said it all and is followed by most players who dance blindly down the commercial path: Keep It Simple, Stupid. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s all down to technical ability for each genre. There are only really a few guitarists that have successfully wandered over to different genres to become masters of all. I\u2019m going to use one example only for you. Gary Moore - well known as a heavy rock guitarist from eh 80\u2019s. What many people don't know is he started with blues at the age of 15 - he was so good, he attracted the attention of arguably one of the best blues players ever, Peter Green. So, Moore made all his money from heavy rock and blindingly fast solo\u2019s for the mid to late 70\u2019s, and influenced many of of the worlds greatest players who are out there now. He continued with a good heavy rock career all the way through the 80\u2019s and is considered one of the best metal guitarists of all time. But, Moore literally stopped playing rock overnight and in the early 90\u2019s started playing blues only \u2026 of course, this was a disappointment for many of his fans, but he then found fame as a blues player, and is now considered one of the finest blues players of all time if not the best. But what many people don't know is that he was a great Jazz Fusion guitarist, playing with the successful Prog Rock, Jazz Fusion band Colosseum 2 from 75\u201378. Can he play traditional jazz - bearing in mind he is a metal guitar god, THE blues guitar god (most blues players of note themselves cite him as the best), one of the first great jazz fusion guitarists \u2026 well take a look at this and tell me if he\u2019s any good at pure Jazz  Of course, he\u2019s not the only guitar player that crosses genres with ease. Eric Clapton was a blues master, but he also had fabulous skills with reggae, and other genres. I suspect, being a good guitarist with 40 years experience, and having played in several bands, some known, others not, and played session, to be a master of all genres would be difficult as there are so many. But rock and jazz are not really that far apart, so someone with the time and good theory knowledge should be able to cross those two without any problem. However, what would be awkward for the jazz master would be the use of all the little bells and whistles a rock guitarist has, like the wham bar and the different sounds you can work with pedals - the amp settings and what you can do with them, using the volume control to its best, etc. Unless you have some experience with eh genre, you cannot just cross over just like that - I can attest to that fact from personal experience.

            "answer_text": "Well, of course a jazz guitarist would say we are. But one objective reason why this is probably true is: we work way harder at being better guitar players, right from the start. Rockers can be very impatient - mostly they want to get to the bar, play and get the applause (and get laid) without any regard of how much work goes into doing just that. There are exceptions I\u2019ll discuss below. Jazz guys start by learning to read music, studying theory and learning hundreds of standards. We spend lonely nights and weekends practicing complicated solos, practicing comping, practicing improvising over more and more complicated chord changes. I\u2019ve been doing this for over 3 decades now, and I think I may be getting kind of decent at it. Probably not, though. Some rockers have a jazz player\u2019s discipline and skill - guys like Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen (ETA and their antecedents, Stevie Ray Vaughn and Steve Vai) have a jazz mentality, even with a rocker attitude and style and spirit. Sure, I like their music - why wouldn\u2019t I? And it\u2019s never a good idea to state one is better than another as a fact when it comes to music or any art. That\u2019s not how art works. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you want to get your message across. Today I was working on Coltrane changes on a turnaround, but yesterday I was trying to cop Clapton\u2019s take on Hideaway, which I double checked against Freddie\u2019s version. Most of my time is spent studying jazz - Joe Pass, Bird, Benson - but to get too far removed from the blues is to lose contact with the roots of the music. I can tell you, unequivocally - and I\u2019m good enough to fool a number of the people for a fair amount of the time - that Jimi Hendrix could make me look like a fool. Sure he can\u2019t play Donna Lee, but he could nail the blues 6 ways from Sunday. You can connect with your audience - and that\u2019s what all music is about, regardless of genre - in a number of ways: intellectually or physically. [i.e., through their brains or their balls.] - and there are an infinite number of gradations. And each individual listener has any number of gradations. What tingles me may not tingle you, physically or emotionally. So who\u2019s better? Who\u2019s listening? Some people are only moved by, say, Stevie Ray Vaughan - and he was a monster, hugely talented - and some people only get moved by Miles Davis on Kind of Blue. Ever checked out Mozart? That mutha could nail it. I\u2019ve read the other answers and agree with them all, and I\u2019ll shut up by saying that music is the language of the gods, and they don\u2019t care about your accent.

            "answer_text": "The boundaries blur as the decades pass. I was in a jazz band with 5 bass players; one on sax and clarinet; another, a rock guitarist, on jazz guitar; a third on keyboards and various brass instruments; a fourth on drums (another rock guitarist who this time started in classical guitar); and the fifth on trombone, flugelhorn, and the actual double bass in the band. Drums and double bass were the youngest, being veritable puppies and only in their early fifties. By the time musicians get to these sorts of ages, they have had plenty of time to fiddle about with different instruments. Some people stick with their original instrument and others pick up various things. Of course some people are just straight-out talented, and bass player 3 was a very hot keyboard player who had been in a few big-name Australian rock bands, and been thrown out of most of them due to his difficult personality. He did leave the jazz band after a final gig in which he was even more red-hot than usual. The double bass player thought he was showing off and went home after the first set, but I just sat in the background and enjoyed playing along to this red-hot virtuoso at his best. So are jazz guitarists better than rock guitarists? Well, jazz and rock are two separate things, and the hot players are probably pretty good at both, provided (this is important) that they enjoy and have a good feel for jazz and rock. There is more going on in jazz, but you underestimate rock at your peril.Join a jazz band and a rock band and find out. You'll wake up one day with grey hair playing an instrument you never would have expected. but it's all good fun. Jazz is fun. Rock is fun. ",

To be a good Rock player, you are not required to understand a whole lot in the way of theory and such. So, in understanding things better, yes, Jazz players tend to be \u201cbetter\u201d. But there are a good number of Rock players who are quite well versed in music as a whole, understanding theory and able to read notation. You\u2019d be surprised. And, to be honest, there are a fair number of Jazz players who cannot read notation, and learned along the way from other players the things required to be good at playing Jazz. You\u2019d be surprised how many. So\u2026 let\u2019s be honest. As a general rule, Jazz players can adapt to Rock easier than a Rock player can adapt to Jazz. So, there it is.

Jazzers have the edge but there are no doubt a few Jazz greats with little formal training; there are certainly Rock greats with lconsiderable theory and formal training. Speed \u2014 edge to rockers \u2014 perhaps. But since speed (sometimes sans accuracy) isn\u2019t common in Jazz, who knows. Building a sound pallet without FX - Jazz; overall sound pallet considering only end results, could go to rock. And on and on we go. I do metrics for a living and so I can say that we can only compare if we have a consistent set of requirements and measurable outcomes to go by. I play mostly blues and Jazz and freely concede that I\u2019m not a very credible rock guitarist or bassist. I\u2019m not \u201cfast,\u201d more interested in interpreting a song as a group rather than a note-for-note rendition punctuated by a free form solo, etc. I don\u2019t view any one instrument as being the lead instrument. And while I concede that vocals will always reign in popular music, I like instrumental music at least as much. In my world, there\u2019s no missing notes because that\u2019s an acceptable compromise in getting the speed up. Nor can I cover up anything with volume, distortion or other FX. Whole different ballgame than rock! ",

It\u2019s usually a mess because they\u2019re used to approaching the instrument differently. With a clean sound, you have to force sound out of the instrument. With a distorted sound, you have to control the instrument as you\u2019re trying to play it. Each one is a skill unto itself, and if you don\u2019t work on it, you won\u2019t be good at it. That said, jazz simply requires a more complicated musical vocabulary for basic proficiency than rock does (and I say that as a rock guitarist who was trained in jazz). Having a jazz vocabulary certainly helps my rock playing to a greater extent than having a rock vocabulary helps my jazz playing. But both do contribute to one another at the end of the day. An interesting follow up question would be \u201cAre fusion jazz guitarists way better than both jazz and rock guitarists.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It feels kinda strange saying it, but: yes. Typically a jazz guitarist has put much more time into studying harmony and getting to know their instrument than a rock guitarist. Pick a random jazzer and a random rocker and the jazzer almost certainly is going to be better at most things than the rocker. A good jazz guitarist can usually imitate a good rock guitarist very well while a rocker would have no hope of improvising over a set of modulating chord changes; they probably also would have a very limited set of voicings to comp with, possibly not knowing at all what to play over e.g. an F#7#11. On the other hand, I\u2019ve known a few jazzers who sound hilarious trying to play rock music; really weak, trying to \u201cskee-bop-a-do\u201d over some heavy stuff, not having enough raw energy or stylistic exposure to do it right. However, I\u2019m sure that they could if given a month or less to focus on the style while I\u2019d be surprised if a rock guitarist could do a convincing improv on even an easy jazz tune after a month.

The average jazz guitarist has more knowledge and chops than the average rock guitarist. I could play guitar in a punk rock band and be very successful, with the kind of skills you can develop in about 3 months. I would argue that you should not be called a jazz guitarist unless you have knowledge of many, many chords and the ability to play over complex key changes, etc, whereas for rock, you don\u2019t need to know much to be successful. In today\u2019s world, rock guitar is not what it used to be. I\u2019m sure there are still varieties of rock where virtuoso soloing is happening, and of course that can go to an extremely high level, but to my knowledge, rock guitar is devolving mainly. I\u2019m sure there are exceptions though. But the question is not \u201cIs Every Rock Guitarist Inferior to Every Jazz Guitarist?\u201d All this said, I still like rock more overall than jazz, and I listen to rock more than jazz. There are not that many jazz guitarists that I really like, but Pat Metheny was my number one guitar hero for about 20 years. I also am a big fan of Al di Meola from his late 70\u2019s era. When I listen to jazz, usually there is no guitarist. Rock without a guitarist is so strange, it\u2019s almost funny. ",

            "answer_text": "My question for you is what will you get out of the answer to this question? Are you going to base your entire guitar career around the answer that you deem worthy? Jazz players play harmonically dense/coloured chord voicings, technical melodies and solo through chord changes using lots of arpeggios and modal approaches etc.. Rock guitarist chords are generally less harmonically coloured, sing their melodies and solo with the blues scale, arpeggios and they also play modes and other more coloured scales. I think jazz guitarists enjoy the challenge of getting busy on the fretboard where rock guitarists can kick back and play their part and wail a solo now and then. Also I didn't touch on riffs. Jazz riffs can float into blues land and can be a little more rhythmically complex and rock riffs are all largely very pentatonic heavy or don't stray too far from the maj/min scale. Better isn't the right word. Appropriate to the style and fitting in with the band is a more interesting way to look at it. Learn both and see what resonates with your more :) ",

The Jazz guy plays dry & clean in multiple keys & run around the the \u201cCircle of 5th\u2019s\u201d. Rock bands play in 1 key, most have no clue what the circle of 5th\u2019s are let alone utilize it & have a bass, rhythm & lead guitarist as their band & most songs have no real melody. A Jazz guitarist plays all part by them self with complex chords\u2026Chord/Melodies. The rock guy is elementary school & the Jazz guy has a PHD! Let me give you 2 guitarist for starters (who have both passed\u2026RIP!) & if you cannot stand listening to either of them you do not understand music & their brilliance\u2026Allan Holdsworth & Wes Montgomery.

Most jazz players have a fairly sound command of music theory, most read because so much jazz is in print and so much of it is played on instruments other than the guitar and isn't in TAB. As a jazz player I have been able to accept many gigs in other genres simply because I have my theory together and learning the nuts and bolts of the new style was that much easier. It is true that some elements of jazz guitar require a technique that is way beyond that which is encountered by most rock guitarists. Take chord solos. The book of Joe Pass\u2019 Chord Solos for example is a collection of his transcribed chord melodies. Playing these requires a phenomenal technique. Creating them requires a true virtuoso. ",

            "answer_text": "A super advanced jazz player would technically be better yes but they may not be able to be rock guitar well. Ideally, you want to have knowledge of basic jazz theory and some chops with chords and soloing because it would really enhance your rock playing. Allman Brothers loved Miles Davis and his Kind of Blue album where there is a ton of soloing. That's why they were so good at soloing in their rock stuff!! Now if you are including metal in the rock genre, then that would rival the jazz theory and advanced music concepts. But ya, rock guitar is more simple than jazz guitar so a pure rock guitarist wouldn't get as advanced as a jazzer. Note that I'm not referring to \u201cbetter\u201d in terms of style. That's completely preferential and subjective and has nothing to do with \u201cbetter\u201d. ",

In some other things, they are not (on average) for the same reasons. \u201cBetter\u201d is a matter of opinion when it comes to music. I mean sure there are different technical aspects you can evaluate (like how many notes per minute they can play or how many different techniques they can incorporate) but for the listener, those might be a bit trivial. Usually listeners only care if it sounds good (and sometimes: does it look cool). I do not think there is a genre that would dominate all the possible ways of measuring \u201cbetterness\u201d. But both jazz and rock guitarists do play in a genre that seems to appreciate virtuosity. So in both genre\u2019s you\u2019ll find players so good that they\u2019ll pretty much excel at anything. ",

While agreeing with others that a jazz musician will probably have a deeper knowledge of music theory and all those arcane 5 note chords\u2014 that is just one direction to go deeper. My criteria for judging a musician is: has she or he gone in a new direction, perfected and explored some new area of musical expression, and brought that to an audience in an accessible way by connecting emotionally with their music? There are so many different ways of doing that. While I actually prefer to listen to jazz guitarists, I can appreciate somebody like Jimi Hendrix too. What he is doing is incomprehensible to me (from a technique point of view, since I don\u2019t play electric). But he\u2019s a genius nonetheless. There is simply no way to say he is better or worse than Django Reinhardt. ",

            "answer_text": "1.) What do you mean by rock guitarist and jazz guitarist?    Interestingly, to reach a definite answer, the identification of what a rock guitarist and jazz guitarist would need to be determined.  Considering how both genres of jazz and rock have evolved,  it's difficult to identify a jazz guitarist and rock guitarist due to vagueness and generalization.  One would have to determine how far the \"rubber-band\" should be stretched for the definitions of a jazz guitarist and rock guitarist.  How about the guitarist Larry Correll who plays straight ahead jazz, and fusion? Or Jimi Hendrix, a guitarist who plays rock, but has been evaluated to have some blues and jazz elements in his playing? Or John Lennon, who is a singer/songwriter and rock guitarist? How about a jazz guitar legend such as Wes Montogmery and a beginner rock guitarist who has been playing for 6 months? How do the above answers/questions fit with the definition of a jazz guitarist and rock guitarist? 2.) The answer to your initial question depends on whom you are asking. I would also like to say that while listeners might be able to pinpoint a few areas that they like to listen to in either a jazz or rock guitarists such as \"catchiness,\" \"applied music theory,\"  \"innovation,\" or \"virtuosity,\" a key area that determines someone's music choice to be better, worse, same, or something else also depends on a psychosocial dimension: The reinforcement of one's self identity concepts such as their public self, private self, real self, etc.  According to this study, there is a correlation between personality and music preference: http://psychcentral.com/lib/preferred-music-style-is-tied-to-personality/So the answer to your initial question also depends on who you are talking to.  Reflecting on this topic, I sometimes wonder myself whether there is such a thing as a consensus or definitive answer to music questions like this. ",

This happens with almost all of the music questions. Three anecdotal observations that doesn\u2019t necessarily answer the question but which matter, I think. I don\u2019t have figures, but my strong guess is that more jazz guitarists are classically-trained. This doesn\u2019t make them better in and of itself but in increases the chances that they have greater technical proficiency.My sense is that a jazz guitarist needs to know more to be generally effective. As in, knowing more chords, more positions in which to play them, etc.I do think that what you have been doing for a long time, in many cases, makes you better at that thing. I wouldn\u2019t want Billy Gibbons replaced in ZZ Top with any jazz guitarist, for example.",

Their sense of musicality was more developed. They had a much better sense of which chords and sequences of notes would fit together in an emotionally moving way. Jazz guitarists remind me more of mathematicians than musicians. What they play may look elegant on paper, and may be deeply appreciated by fellow jazz fans, but as far as moving the larger audience musically, they're just not as good. ",

A standard rock guitarist would struggle with relatively simple jazz tunes. In fact, many jazz guitarists make their living playing as session or touring musicians for pop and rock acts.

Some of the more traditional jazz band guitarists are awful on speed, rakes and tremolo picking though to the point they can\u2019t play rock. In general, rock is pretty easy to play though. It\u2019s power chords + a pentatonic solo. Really good guitarists really don\u2019t have a lot of trouble playing anything. The difference between jazz and rock is in jazz the guitar is accompaniment, in rock, it\u2019s lead. And jazz uses chord scale. So you see a chord and you play the scale to the chord. Most other music works on the reverse. It\u2019s generally going to be easier for a jazz guitarist to play rock music than vice versa outside certain genres like shred, prog rock, some technical death metal and the more technical end of djent and mathrock where speed and precision is key.

From the idiomatic view, jazz in general has much higher requirements technically to pull off, which many others here have mentioned. Where I disagree with what some have mentioned here is that rock has a broader sound palette, and rock an easier structure. Both have now bled over into each other that there are rock bands that apply some frightening levels of jazz chops and approaches and jazz outfits that has applied rocks most terse characteristics (e.g. Living Colour, Screaming Headless Torsos, Helmet, Decoding Society, Allan Holdsworth, Burnt Sugar, GoGo Penguin, etc) ",

But it is a generalization and there are many modern rock guitarists with just as deep knowledge and technique as the best jazz players. There are virtuosos in all genres that have incredible skills. Good players will normally be able to play a variety of styles. ",

Some examples would be Larry Carlton, Lee Rittenour, Russ Freeman, Grant Geissman. Larry and Lee both started as first call studio guitarist on pop and rock sessions but ultimately moved onto solo careers that gradually became jazz music. All these guys can go toe to toe with the best jazz or rock guitarist. The true great guitarist has mastered every style of those who came before them and developed their own style. Finally I must say that Steely Dan was the first rock band to fully embrace jazz. Larry played lead on many of their songs. The chords that Dan used are very much jazz and playing their songs is extremely difficult compared to most rock songs. ",

Jazz harmony is much more complex than traditional rock, pop or blues forms. Someone who has spent a lot of years of their life playing rock or blues find it difficult to keep up with a jazz band. But the reverse is also true - someone who is accustomed to playing jazz often has difficulty getting the right feeling in other styles of music, they end up being \"too busy\" or incapable of getting into the groove. So although a jazz musician might have an advanced conception of harmonic structure, they might not sound good playing with a reggae or rock band. ",

The consistency of having to play against such compositions tells me that a musician has to have a strong aptitude to understand and play in such a song. Think of it as being an engineer and having to solve for some abstract design or solution. That\u2019s not to take anything away from Van Halen, Clapton, Mayer, Vai, etc. If they had put in the time I\u2019m sure they could have succeeded.

Being a good jazzer generally requires a much greater knowledge of theory and the ability to play across key changes and time signatures and much more complex harmonic structures. Being a good rocker requires a great feel for the groove,  a knowledge of blues-based music, the ability to bend notes with great accuracy and an understanding of amps and effects that jazzers generally don't need. Of course, these skills are not exclusive to each style. I would say that the average jazzer is better educated than the average rocker but being great at either takes a lot of work and commitment.

Jazz is slow and all about the groove.  Jazz is more based around playing complete chords in different keys and sequences. Rock is more based around power chords and guitar solos. Being a rock guitarist myself, I'm more biased towards rock guitarists. But I've seen some amazingly talented jazz players at shows: Paco de Lucia is the best I've ever seen. His ability far surpasses my own and he's legendary. He's phenomenal hands down. ",

I had just learned a piece from one of my favorite bands and had practiced it all week until I had it down cold. After playing it for him he looked me right in the eye and asked \"do you want to be a musician or a technician?\" He explained to me that there are many great technicians in the world. They can play fast, sight play, play any passage upon hearing it once, run scales and passages up and down like they were nothing. He also told me that they were not musicians but rather musical masturbators. Bob Dylan is a great musician, Neil Young is a great musician even though they are not very good technicians. ",

As far as technique goes, each style has techniques that require dedication in order to master them. So again, I wouldn\u2019t say one style is better than another; they\u2019re different. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the same as asking what is the best guitarist of all time. To compare two things you need to define methods and metrics to it, what is hard to do with musicians and probably any kind of art in general.  You could judge them by their techniques, their musical theory knowledge and going in details in all of them and would still be vague. Judging a musician is judging his soul and how good his brain can transform theory in music, and how good they can transmit their feelings. So basically comparing them is comparing the feelings they are transmitting for you. So instead of who is better, I think the best way is asking yourself what you like the most to hear and why. Which are the rock or jazz techniques, time measures and scales that makes you appreciate it? The guitarists I like the most are the one that exploit amazing techniques, such as speed picking, sweeps, two-hand playing, tapping and strings skipping in different styles and still putting a great amount of musicality. And also the ones that can mix different styles like playing Jazzy and they are soloing in a rock song. Guthrie Govan, Paul Gilbert and Joe Satriani are some of the guitarists I appreciate the most.   ",

Listen to \u201cRace With the Devil On Spanish Highway\u201d. Try and box that into one genre. Further, none of these guitarists, I believe, would try and box Hendrix or SRV into one \u201cstyle\u201d or another despite the volume; they would just appreciate the beauty of their playing . Try not to categorize or \u201cbox in\u201d players. Personally, I just know that I love to hear those six strings regardless of whoever is playing or whatever they are playing! My 2 cents. ",
