            "answer_text": "What Michael Jackson did as an artist to influence music probably suffices to fill multiple books. But let's name the main points.  He was one of the few in his time to be a complete entertainer. He was a songwriter, a great singer and a dancer. His perfectionism is a benchmark used for any dancer even today. The concept of music videos as short films is one of Michael Jackson's greatest accomplishments. You know, the way music videos often have this sort of story they tell? Well, that's thanks to good ol' MJ.In the 80's MJ's \"Motown 25\" performance and the subsequent sales of Thriller almost singlehandedly kickstarted the music industry, which was getting sorta dusty at the time. MJ made MTV the success it is today, and moreover, through his sheer skill and success, moved it to integrate black music in the channel. He effectively broke through a racial barrier, which has made it possible for pretty much all African-American artists after him to even get on TV.Michael Jackson popularized the Robot, break-dancing and many other dance styles. He also invented a lot of cool moves, although the Moonwalk is not one of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                To sum it up,  MJ  took elements from all the greats before him, condensed them to one entertainer, added copious amounts of his own individualism and innovation and thereby became the man he is.",
