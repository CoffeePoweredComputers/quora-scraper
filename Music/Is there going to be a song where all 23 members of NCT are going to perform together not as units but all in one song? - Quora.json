            "answer_text": "Most likely yes. In the vlive with all 23 members there was a segment where the members looked like they were in a zoom call. There was a teacher that was explaining NCT 2020. During the explanation Haechan said (not exactly this is based off of my horrible memory lol) \u201cTeacher, is there going to be a song that's performed by all 23 members?\u201d and the teacher responded with \u201c\uae30\ub300\ud558\ub77c\uace0\" which can either mean \u201clook forward to it\" or keep waiting. Seeing that Haechan specifically asked the question and from the way the teacher answered I think it's highly likely we will indeed have a performance with all 23 members. Now if this turns out to be the case, it's probably going to be similar to black on black, heavily dance and performance focused. It'll probably be around three minutes because anything more than 4 minutes similar to black on black would be seriously exhausting. So this means es the popular members will be center, yes line distribution will be trash, and yes SM will treat some of the members like back-up dancers\u2014but to be honest there's nothing we can do about it and I actually feel like resonance pt 1 was very very fair compared to what we've been getting in the past. I guess what I'm trying to say is folks, look forward to the rest of NCT 2020, and please let's enjoy ourselves instead of fighting and complaining. The End. ",

            "answer_text": "As of Tuesday, October 13th, 2020, we don\u2019t know. The answer is most likely yes if their schedules align with each other. NCT has 23 members and I believe many of them are busy with many projects besides NCT 2020. I do hope so, because it would be a smart move but also depressing because we know obviously Taeyong, Mark, Lucas, and other popular members would get screentime or center. People may accuse SM of favoritism despite cool choreography. Yet if they were able to hide NCT 2020 under our noses, then they might be hiding this too! ",
