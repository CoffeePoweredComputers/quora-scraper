            "answer_text": "Because she had limited vocal abilities and a limited stage presence. She made her debut at 16 in Las Vegas where all the Jackson children performed together in the late \u201870\u2019s. The Jackson 5 were past their glory days , their album sales were already in decline but they did sell out venues. Joe Jackson tried to form a girl band with his 3 daughters Rebbie, La toya and Janet. Rebbie is in fact the most talented of them, clearly she had the best voice of all the Jacksons , besides Michael of course but she married at 18 to a devout Jehovah Witness. Thus, she could not focus on her career. Like almost all the Jackson kids Rebbie married very young to get away from her overbearing father, Tito and Marlon also married at 18, Jermaine at 19, Janet also married secretly at 18, though her marriage was later annuled, Jackie also married in his early 20\u2019s. Her father was so upset that he refused to give Rebbie away. Janet starred at tv sitcoms in the \u201870\u2019s and early \u201880\u2019s . It was her father\u2019s idea that she became a singer instead of an actress though she has successfully starred in many films. Janet was offered roles in Jerry Maguire and the Matrix but she declined due to schedule conflicts. The girl band with the Jackson girls , unlike the Jackson 5 who were extremely successful,had no success. Rebbie released an album with songs written and produced by her brother Michael , with modest success. Janet\u2019s first two albums were massive flops. She fired her father and hired John MacClain as her manager and had gigantic success since 1986. Objectively Janet is not much of a singer, she is a second soprano, big deal, but she is an incredible dancer, extremely hard working and she does put on a good show. La toya on the other hand, who incidentally and surprisingly as a child was painfully shy, very timid, a devout Jehovah Witness and her only friend was her mother Katherine , fired her father Joe Jackson and hired Jack Gordon, a mentally ill , abusive mobster, who took advantage of her , abused her, beat her, took all her money, forced her to marry him in Las Vegas, brainwashed her against her family, made her strip for Playboy, write a tell all book on her family, made her pretend she was a psychic, and in general made her a joke. By the time , she divorced Jack Gordon in 1998, she was broke, owed millions , thus she had to file for bankruptcy , she was too old to rebuild her career and she was considered damaged goods. La toya met Jack Gordon at the 1984 Grammys , her father hired him as her assistant and he accompanied her on a business trip to Japan , where he took her passport and stole her money. He died of cancer in April 2005. He terrorised La toya who was petrified of him and did as she was told , hence she wrote a book badmouthing and disgracing her family, posed nude for Playboy, alleged Michael was a paedophile for money etc. La toya visited Neverland for the first time in May 2002, when Blanket was 3 months old . How could she know even if Michael did indeed molest kids in Neverland? She was in Europe during that time with Jack Gordon who smelt money and sold molestation stories to the Press for 500.000 $. She had no contact with her family and by then she had not seen Michael in years. Even the tabloids paid them nothing when they realised that Latoya was lying. The only ones who made it big in the Jackson family were in fact Michael and Janet. Jackie, Rebbie, Tito, Jermaine, Rebbie, Latoya all tried to kick off singing careers but had little, if any success at all. They were not half as talented , hard working , ambitious , driven as Michael and Janet. La toya had a difficult life , she experienced domestic abuse by Jack Gordon , she had very limited talent and a lot of controversy. By the time she was free of Gordon she was too old to pursue a career. If she had made different choices nobody knows how things would have turned out for her. She was not very talented though. ",

            "answer_text": "Plain and simple Latoya just didn\u2019t have it. I watched a few of her videos and found them to be sort of cheesy. I think that she was more contrived, she looked like she was trying to hard to be sexy or to appear as though she had talent. She wasn\u2019t a natural like Janet who has \u201c Stage Whip Appeal. \u201c, she didn\u2019t exude an aura that would capture audiences. Michael and Janet had that \u201c It. \u201c factor that makes you a star, Michael more so, but Latoya has never had that quality, she just never had what it takes. Michael and Janet were truly the most talented in that family, hands down. ",
