            "answer_text": "Based on the presumption that a traditional sociopathic personality profile; it being constituted by the comorbidity of ASPD and NPD, with impulsivity and reactive responses leading to a more aggressive passional behavior, different from that of a psychopath\u2019s which is lacking the intense rush of emotionality and presents a more calculated \u201cthick skinned\u201d approach to problem solving, even when violent(not aggressive). I don\u2019t like the terminology nor do I agree with what it\u2019s based on, since it is all very vague and(pardon my french) half assed research. However the main difference, as far as I can tell is wether it\u2019s an act of violence or one of aggression. Narcissists are not necessarily psychopathic or sociopathic; generally speaking they present antisocial traits, but these are not what defines their main disorder\u2019s symptoms. Yet, within that antisocial tendencies of narcissists, we can appreciate both callous and cold instrumentalist violence and passional impulsive aggressive reactiveness. What you refer to as sociopaths, I take it as an allusion to a more extreme manifestation of antisocial behavior, now theory says that all psychopaths and sociopaths are narcissists, which to a point could be of some value of truth, but still overly simplistic. But, and here is the real answer, narcissists can be\u2026triggered by specific stressors(also why I don\u2019t believe correlation means causation in NPD and ASPD) while some sociopaths act violently without the justification of an external stimuli, they simply use violence as another tool to navigate their way towards whatever end they may have. Narcissists don\u2019t use this type of violence, they have fits, or like you called them \u201cNarcissistic rage\u201d, it is similar, if not to the same extent of violence, but only when something is pushing the narcissistic susceptibilities and it is that which throws them into the very volatile state of mind. There really is no definitive answer, because there really is no definitive definition of what any of those terms mean. So I hope this helped. Sorry if it\u2019s rushed and convoluted, just managed to get a few minutes to try and answer this. ",
