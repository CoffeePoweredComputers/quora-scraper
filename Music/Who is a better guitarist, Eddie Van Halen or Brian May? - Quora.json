            "answer_text": "Who is a better guitarist, Eddie Van Halen or Brian May? This is like asking \u201cwhich is better, the apple or the orange?\u201d Each are equally excellent guitarists in their own rights. Eddie\u2019s playing is kind of raw, in-your-face, partying rock-n-roll.  Whereas Brian\u2019s is more melodic, soaring, and relaxing-on-the-couch-with-a-blunt style rock-n-roll.  And both are adept in each one\u2019s own style. Each one has his own unique sound which makes them easily identifiable. Even if you\u2019ve never heard the song before, when you hear Eddie, you know it\u2019s Eddie and the same goes for Brian. And no matter which one you are listening to, you will still pick up your \u201cair-guitar\u201d and jam along until you pass out from the massive head-rush each guitarist gives you.

            "answer_text": "That's like comparing apples to oranges! They're both great guitarists just in different ways! Eddie was the first of the modern day innovators and virtuosos and practically invented shredding! Brian May is not as much of a guitar acrobat as EVH but he has a very distinctive tone and expressive style that is all his! Brian May's contribution to Queen's sound is ever bit as important as Eddie's was to Van Halen\u2019s! ",
