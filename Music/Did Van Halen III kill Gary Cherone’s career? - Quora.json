            "answer_text": "It was certainly an opportunity to maybe resurrect his career. Gary played in the band Extreme which came on the scene in the late 80\u2019s. They\u2019re a very talented band featuring a dynamic duo of talent with Gary\u2019s powerful vocals and entertaining stage presence. Gary had a lot of good dance type moves when performing which made him entertaining to watch but he also had a real dynamic vocal range as well. Nuno Bettencourt was the lead guitarist and was no slouch as a vocalist either. In all rights, Nuno could be a decent lead singer on his own but he was a very accomplished guitarist. The rest of the band was also very very talented. They were kind of a cross between glam rock and funk. IMO, Extreme was a victim of identity crisis during a changing time in music. Their second album \u201cPornograffiti\u201d was their breakthrough album. Their second single release \u201cGet The Funk Out\u201d is actually very interesting. It\u2019s got Nuno\u2019s hard driven guitar sound but is actually more geared towards \u201camped up dance music\u201d which is kinda cool . Gary has always had decent lyrics but can frequently use too many words to express his thoughts in meter. Their third single release was the killer though. \u201cMore than Words\u201d was an all-acoustic ballad which at the time was popular on the radio. Featured some great harmony between Gary and Nuno but the tune got blasted by hard core rockers because of their \u201clook\u201d and Nuno\u2019s edgy guitar skills which lended itself more towards a hard rock genre. Whatever the case - that videowas on MTV all the time to the point of ridicule. It gave them a very soft perception. Their 4th single release nailed the coffin shut. \u201cWhole Hearted\u201d which is a decent enough song but again using acoustic (this time 12 string). For listeners it fell in the same soft rock bucket of \u201cMore than Words\u201d as softer, love Type song. Sadly enough - their two most commercially successful singles really alienated their Intended (hopeful ) new base of fans (or who they were trying to look like) in the early 90\u2019s. Maybe those songs were really who they were or maybe they were pushed to do something radio friendly but whatever the case, it was a career directional mistake. Now come along Van Halen III. Honestly , it could have been a fit. Gary is a great singer. In fact he was accused of sounding a lot like Sammy on that album. Eddie needs a musical collaborator. He always has. In the early days, it was Roth and Ted Templeman in the studio that helped shape and mold Ed\u2019s ideas into fully formed songs. Keep in mind that Ted Templeman (a legendary producer was with VH all the way through 1984). Then the breakup with Roth. At that point Sammy was able to Really help collaborate well with Eddie to shape ideas into songs. Sammy has a knack for knowing how to develop hooks. They used a lot of different producers after that ; Mick Jones from Foreigner, Don Landee (who has engineering credit for most all of VH\u2019s Roth era albums), Andy Jons (legendary British producer and brother of legendary producer Glyn Jons). By the time, VH brought in Gary - Eddie was starting to go through serious substance abuse issues. He had a lot of people in his ear about taking control of his band, not needing a good producer, thinking about ditching Michale Anthony, his marriage had ended. They had changed management prior to Sammy leaving. While I\u2019m sure Gary auditioned well (singing the hell out of their old catalogue I\u2019m sure). VH 3 was Eddie\u2019s project from start to finish. Gary didn\u2019t turn out to be the same kind of collaborator as Roth or Hagar. While he is a collaborator, His style in his lyrics, his delivery and phrasing just wasn\u2019t a great match for Van Halen who had always been this \u201cparty-band\u201d persona. Not to mention that the music of the songs themselves were probably some of the weakest Ed ever created (there again -because this was Eddie\u2019s project to do everything HIS way - he even sang lead on once tune which was God awful) In the end - kinda sad for Gary. Victim of bad timing. If Ed had been cleaner and if they had used a tried and true producer like they had in the past (maybe go back to Templeman, Landee or Jons) - the outcome could have been different. It probably did damage Gary just a bit but he wound back up with Extreme and seems happy there playing to the relatively small base of Extreme loyalists that have been around for a long time. Gary is a class-act guy. Never spoke a bad word about any of it which in my book - makes him a classy guy because he could have thrown VH (and Eddie ) completely under the bus for what a shit show things were in that camp at the time. I\u2019m sure he wondered what the hell he had gotten himself into ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how ruthless we want to be in our assessment. Van Halen\u2019s Balance (1995), reached #1 on the Billboard charts in the US, sold 3 million copies, and represented some effort to expand the band\u2019s sound. But it was easily their least memorable album. Van Halen were in a lull. Likewise, Cherone\u2019s career was essentially moribund when he joined the band. He hadn\u2019t had a hit album since 1990\u2019s Pornograffiti. Extreme\u2019s III Sides to Every Story (1992) only sold 700k records. So two acts that were struggling united and released a not-very-good album. (I\u2019d say that Josephina is an interesting hybrid of Eddie and Extreme.) Did it sink Cherone\u2019s career? You could argue that he didn\u2019t have one: AFAIK no one else in 1996 was picking up the phone to ask him to join their band. He certainly had more to prove than Van Halen. Might other bands have called if he had never joined VH, or if III was better? Maybe. Both acts certainly missed a shot at redemption. ",
