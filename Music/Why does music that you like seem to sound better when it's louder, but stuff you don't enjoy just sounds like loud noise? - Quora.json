            "answer_text": "Careful not to damage any ear drums but louder music has more energy behind it. The stuff that you don't enjoy is probably classical music or jazz because humans want music that's easy to catch for the ear and that is not complicated in form and harmony. Most humans want music that's easily stimulating and focuses more on groove however they aren't patient enough to understand the message behind these more complicated types of music which relate to life more since life is complicated itself. So people want the \u201ceasy\u201d world not the complicated one we are living in right now no matter whether they consciously think that or not. That's the way it is. It's easier to filter the chaos in the world in a few categories rather than treating them all as separate unique events and trying to find order amidst the chaos which is the job of all scientists.
