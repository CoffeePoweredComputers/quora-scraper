            "answer_text": "Option 1: If you have the means to study under George Massenburg at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada, or Susan Rogers at Berklee College in Boston, you could expect to have a mind altering educational experience that would change your life forever in ways you never could have imagined. One word of caution would be that in today\u2019s commercial music environment, it\u2019s very possible to over invest in a University education and graduate with more debt than you can hope to earn back and quite possibly more knowledge of elaborate techniques and extravagant recording equipment than you\u2019ll ever see again at \u201cstreet level.\u201d Nevertheless, if a program such as this is accessible to you, the personal rewards would surely outweigh the costs even if the monetary rewards fall short. Option 2: Some of the more affordable and accessible University music programs can have grave drawbacks. I taught such a course at a local University and walked away feeling like I was wasting the student\u2019s time and money. The department was mired in political gamesmanship, showcase mentality, profit and prestige over quality. They could raise $400 million at the drop of a hat to build an extravagant new building complex but $600 to repair a crucial piece of studio gear was out of the question. Much like the public school teachers who buy pencils and paper for the students out of their own pocket, the professors had to either pay for repairs or do without anything that broke. The catch 22, whether it be a YouTube tutorial or an expensive college is that it\u2019s hard to tell the difference between the bogus and the legitimate until after you have the expertise, in which case you no longer need the information. Option 3: Find a studio that does the kind of music production you\u2019re interested in and ask the engineer if he\u2019d be willing to do some private lessons with you. I\u2019ve done this with a few students over the years and thought it worked out quite well indeed. The way we worked was to have the student record his band in his basement studio and then transfer the recorded tracks into the workstation here at my studio. For the lesson, I\u2019d go through various demonstrations of how to work with the tracks, answer any questions and sometimes we\u2019d go off onto an interesting tangent. In cases where the student\u2019s tracks were poorly recorded, I\u2019d have him try again with suggestions and we\u2019d discuss any improvements or lack thereof at the next lesson. It was hands on for the student with the lessons tailor made to fit his needs and interests. In this case, I felt I was giving the student something he could really benefit from. Option 4: If you\u2019re a good self-starter and a hard-core do-it-yourself-er, I\u2019ll offer you an outline for a course of self study that you can modify to fit your own needs. First Semester: Read, read, read. Here\u2019s a link to Music Books Plus (formerly Mix Bookshelf), where you can browse hundreds of books on music production from beginning level to advanced. Pick any one or two that perk your interest and get started. Even if the ones you choose are not the golden nuggets of the craft, each one will help you become better informed about where to look next. Pro Audio Subscribe to Tape Op Magazine. It\u2019s free. Just sign up, dive in an read whatever strikes your interest. Subscribe to Tape Op For some technical reading, I have a couple of links below that will take you to a small treasure trove of information that is not widely known. The first is free access to the owners manuals for the Waves brand software plug ins. For the self-study, you can just skip over or lightly scan the parts that describe how to operate the software. The treasures I speak of will be found in the closing chapters of some of the manuals, where quite a few of them have extensive essays on theory, history, application, tips and tricks for using some of the most essential audio processing tools. This is not internet blog material, but rather good solid, authoritative information written by people who really know what they\u2019re doing. Download Manuals | Waves As an example of what to look for as you browse the manuals, I\u2019ll point specifically to the owners manual for the Waves Renaissance EQ, where Chapter 8 (starting on page 21), is titled, \u201cAn EQ Essay with Wonderful Tips,\u201d that is written by Craig Hutchinson, a designer for Manley Labs. Browse through the manuals and look for chapters like this. You can even download the PDF to keep on hand. https://www.waves.com/1lib/pdf/plugins/renaissance-equalizer.pdf One of the most thorough and authoritative free resources I know of is \u201cMic University\u201d offered by DPA microphones. The information provided here is generally more factual and true than some of the most revered books on the subjects offered. Highly recommended. Pick and choose whatever you like and please note that there are eight pages of titles, about 48 articles in all: Microphone University Next, a DVD course by Alan Parsons, which for 99 bucks complete is so downright dirt cheap for what you get it\u2019s ridiculous: Alan Parsons' Art & Science of Sound Recording If the material in the links above intrigues you, fascinates you or in any way leads you to want to know more, while not leaving you especially burned out and glazed over, then you can approve your own passing grade and move on to Semester 2. Semester 2: Hands On. You\u2019ll need $3000 - $6000 to set up a very basic personal studio in your home. This is about half the cost of a semester of University tuition, plus you get to keep the equipment if the endeavor shows promise. If things don\u2019t work out, you can at least recover 40% of your investment in books and equipment on eBay. As far as choosing studio equipment, you can Google search the various vendors of home recording gear. The sales staff can help you piece together an appropriate system and your first semester reading will have given you enough understanding of the language and concepts to carry on a coherent conversation with the sales rep. By this point in your self-study course, you\u2019ll need to decide whether you want to commit to Pro-Tools, Apple Logic Pro, MOTU Digital Performer, Steinberg WaveLab, FL Studio, etc., as well as choices for your audio interface, additional software, accessories, cables and studio monitors (etc., etc.). However you decide, your central platform is not a make-or-break proposition. If a clear decision fails, just pick one and get started. Most software Digital Audio Workstations come preloaded with software bundles for compression, EQ, Reverb and software synthesizers and virtual instruments. Once you\u2019ve figured out how to make your setup operate, start recording anything and everything you can legally put a microphone in front of or generate sounds, phrases, songs, etc., with the virtual instruments. This can be music but it doesn\u2019t have to be. You can practice and learn about EQ just using white noise, synth loops or even recorded traffic noise. Whatever you choose for material, practice, practice and practice using the Audio Workstation and the processor plug-ins. Tweak the plug-in software through all the possibilities from the most extreme to very subtle to get a sense of how they operate with respect to your reading material. Even without musicians at your disposal you can experiment with sound design, synthesis, looping, sequencing, and so on. Semesters 3 and 4: Bring other people into your studio with some attention to the schedule of progressive levels outlined below. Once you\u2019ve gotten a good hang on how to operate your studio setup as well as troubleshooting unexpected technical snags in a timely manner, it\u2019ll be time to bring some people into the studio and start recording anything and everything that you have time for. If you can sing and play, of course, you can record your own tracks to learn with. Keep in mind that music is not your only option. There are poets, storytellers, lecturers, book readers and all sorts of voice narration prospects to work with when your studio space and resources are limited. Many of them may need custom backing music tracks for their project - <wink, wink, hint, hint> During this entire learning phase, you will be the studio owner, studio manager, producer, chief engineer, mix engineer, mastering engineer, chief technical advisor, scheduling coordinator, and in many cases, the studio musician and even photographer and videographer. Smile! As you work, the roles of each of these job descriptions will become evident. As with any long term learning endeavor, start with the easy and progress gradually toward the difficult. Beginner friendly projects will incorporate mostly electric and/or electronic instruments, software synthesizers, samplers, software percussion, loops and beats. Within your first year, you should be able to use these kinds of instruments to produce and mix songs or backing tracks that are at least acceptable and possibly excellent.Level of difficulty increases somewhat when we bring the human voice into the picture. Let\u2019s say we give that another year of practice and development. Some voices are extremely mic friendly and will just sail through the process. Others will stretch your chops to the limit.The third level of difficulty comes up when we start recording acoustic instruments, which can be further complicated by your acoustic environment. A short list of the easiest of the acoustic instruments are brass, woodwinds, hand percussion, mallet percussion (marimba, xylophone, glockenspiel) steel pans and pipe organ. Unfortunately, these may be rare in a studio that\u2019s new to the market.Small rooms are especially challenging for recording acoustic instruments that are normally heard in large rooms. A short list of these: trap drum set, any large drum such as tympani, djembe or orchestra bass drum. Orchestral harps as well as Celtic harps are also tricky to work with in small rooms. The hardest to work with in small room environments are acoustic guitar, violin, bagpipes, sometimes mandolin and dobro and perhaps the most challenging of all, acoustic piano whether it be upright or grand.Keep in mind that the most profound influence affecting the clarity and quality of your recordings is the competency of the musicians. Given all the technical tools we have at our disposal, this doesn\u2019t make sense until you find yourself working with a group of highly competent musicians and everything just falls into place as if by magic. Ironically, the farther you progress up the career ladder, the easier the job becomes. For supplementary study, search out interviews with George Massenburg, Susan Rogers, Bob Ludwig, Roger Nichols, Steve Albini, Phil Spector, Berry Gordy, Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd, Geoff Emerick, Tony Maserati and Tom Lord Alge. These people are the masters of the craft. They\u2019ll be mostly talking about their general approach and philosophies rather than offering technical \u201chow to\u201d advice. To close, I\u2019ll give you a link here to one of the best of the best. If I ever get around to writing a book, the title will be, \u201cSusan Rogers Is Nothing Short of Amazing!\u201d Her philosophies and approach to music are golden information. With some luck, this link to a high quality presentation might prompt YouTube to suggest other videos that are also of high quality.  Good luck and my best wishes to you for success as a music producer. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know and neither does anyone else here. Ask God when you see him. Bar asking God, here\u2019s my journey to making good music in more electronic genres such as hip-hop/rap, RnB, pop, and EDM: Learn your DAW. Or maybe get one first if you don\u2019t have one. It\u2019s pretty easy to learn your daw. First, spend an hour or two trying to make a song and learn your daw, then check out a tutorial for your DAW, then keep pushing your knowledge and DAW until you hit the limit for your DAW. If you don\u2019t have a DAW, I suggest Garageband, Logic Pro X, or FL Studio. The DAW I use is Garageband since I\u2019m broke and Garageband is an extremely capable system as long as you know how to use it; it gets a bad rap from the number of idiots who put a few loops into it and think they\u2019ve made a song. It took me years to learn Garageband because I was stubborn and didn\u2019t want to listen to any tutorials. The plus side to learning your DAW on your own like I did is complete mastery over your DAW, the downside is it takes a long time.Learn arrangement. One guy here suggested making a basic pop song, which is also how I started, though I didn\u2019t really intend to do it. For arrangement, it is fine to use loops since it will help you learn layering also. The worst thing you can do is just loop a kick and a pad for two hours and say \u201c I\u2019m a Trance producer\u201d; yeah right, you\u2019re just too lazy to put any effort into anything.Learn how to speak music producer. I was about to go onward when I realized a lot of terms I\u2019m about to use are gibberish to your average person. A few terms you should learn are mixing, mastering, producing, beatmaking, engineering, sound design, vst, daw, au, wav, mp3, sampler, plugin, mixer, artist, rhythm, vibe, flow, feel, midi, flip, sample, loop, placement, eq, compression, reverb, limiting, distortion, clipping, db, lufs, rms, saturation, harmonic exciting, and exporting.Learn how to produce beats. Now you might be scratching your head saying, \u201c wasn\u2019t that what I did in the last step?\u201d. My answer to that is no. Beatmakers don\u2019t put a few loops into a track, arrange it and call it a day. Using MIDI, beatmakers/producers make their own melodies, drum patterns and layers. If you find your DAW\u2019s included sounds feel limiting, as they do to most people, then this is your time to install new sounds on your computer and learn more about your DAW. Some great free VST\u2019s are Dexed, Tyrell N6, and all of the Komplete Start Collection. Seriously though, those are all great VST\u2019s. I upgraded your collection by 3000+ sounds, you\u2019re welcome. This is all about creating the rhythm, feel, and vibe of your track. This is the first layer that all songs are built upon. No vibe, no song; it\u2019s that simple.Learn basic mixing. I usually mix while I make a beat, so this step is usually combined with the previous step, but it\u2019s important as a separate element too. Almost all of your beats at first will be too loud. I suggest putting the fader for your lead instrument at around -10 to -16db, put your kick drum fader at -8 to -12db, and put your bass at -16 to -23db. Keep in mind I make rap music, so I suggest you lower the volume of the bass and kick by -5db for EDM, but especially pop music. Learn at minimum how to use EQ, Compression, and Reverb.Learn more advanced mixing techniques. Eventually, you will hit the limit of what basic mixing can do, so you learn more advanced mixing. This includes multiband compression, automation, stereo enhancers, and plugin chains.Learn sound design. Learn some basic sound design. Learn how to create and manipulate sounds within your VST\u2019s, how to manipulate sound outside of your VST\u2019s, and how to create your own sounds from existing sounds. I suggest learning how to manipulate kick samples first because most kick samples suck with the song you\u2019re trying to make (3rd party plugins are a lifesaver). Secondly, you should know how to make things sound wider, which is achievable by a big plugin chain, or one plugin like Wider, which I vastly prefer. Thirdly learn to make an 808 unless you\u2019re making rock or country, since 808\u2019s are easy and fun to make, and in electronic genres are widely used.Learn how to record vocals. Now you might be thinking, \u201cwhy would I do that? it\u2019s sooo easy\u201d. You\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s not as easy as you think it is. Mic placement, room placement, which room your recording in, vocalist, comb filtering, and proximity effects are all things that someone must think about when recording vocals. Also, the actual microphone you use deserves thought into it too. The crappy mic on your earbuds won\u2019t work, the mic on your computer won\u2019t work, and the mic on your phone won\u2019t work. If you are serious about not having crappy vocals I suggest you get a good quality microphone, which good USB mics fall into. Personally I use an AT2020 USB microphone, which gives excellent sound quality if you know how to use it. I suggest you stay away from yeti mics since they have so much fuzz, it\u2019s near impossible to get good recordings.Learn how to mix vocals. Your raw recordings suck. My raw recordings suck. Only pros have raw recordings that are great, and they still process their vocals. You need processing on your vocals if you don\u2019t want your song to suck. You should learn and research multiple vocal chains and learn how to assemble a custom one for yourself. My personal vocal chain is a noise gate, high shelf boost, surgical EQ, Vocal sweetening, exciter, compressor, tonal EQ, compressor, chorus, reverb, compressor, and limiter. If you think my chain is too daunting, I suggest using a noise gate, surgical EQ, compressor, Tonal eq, reverb, and a compressor as a basic vocal chain. You don\u2019t need to use either vocal chain but I highly suggest you use my personal vocal chain or create your own well-honed vocal chain if you want to achieve professional or near professional-sounding results.Learn to master. Congrats, you made it to the final step! You\u2019ve exported your beautiful professional-sounding mix and now you\u2019ve compared it to a professional record. And your song sucks in comparison. The reason your song sucks is because of one final, crucial, step in your production journey. You need to properly master your song. Either you can pay a pro to do it, or you can learn to do it yourself. Personally I suggest you learn to master yourself because it will make you a better mixer, artist, and producer, even if you end up just getting a professional to master it. My mastering chain is a harmonic exciter, EQ, Multiband compressor, Soft-clipper, EQ, limiter, Limiter no.6, lufs meter, frequency analyzer.There you go. That is how you can teach yourself music production. Hopefully, it will take you less than 4 years. ",

            "answer_text": "You can, definitely. But at some point of time, you'll be needing a mentor who can guide you regarding what the \u201cright\u201d approach is and what's a \u201cwrong\u201d one. I'll tell you about myself. I started doing music production 11 months back. I used to learn through YouTube and started off pretty good. But the main problem that I faced with time was that I would get \u201c10+ different methods\u201d to do a specific thing from different people (YouTubers) when I would search for that topic. Now how do I know which one to follow and which one to not? Should I make a judgement based on the reviews? Absolutely not! So I decided to join a crash course thing and learn audio production under him for 3 months. The benefit of that course was that now I could differentiate between what the right approach was and what wasn't. I got to know the logic behind everything there which encouraged me to devise my own methods to produce a song and experiment with the sounds. And the most important thing that I realised after that course was that more than 90% of the people on YouTube don't know anything about audio engineering and are just sharing random concepts in order to gain views or to show that they know how to produce. Hope it helps. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "I am 22 Now, and I have learned music production at home at the age of 18. Its been 4 years and now I have been making all types of amazing music (EDM, Progressive  House, Tropical House, Indie Pop, Future Bass, and Rnb Soul), etc. It depends on how much time you put into it. It may take days to understand a single music term and how to apply it. Alan Walker says it took him over a year to understand music production. Music Production is real easy when you don\u2019t give up and you ought to know a little bit of music theory so you can survive in the long run. Steps to learn music production at home:- 1. Youtube is a king of source! go to youtube and search about your DAW(Digital Audio Workstation) and first learn how to use DAW I have learned FL STUDIO, you can use any DAW.Secondly, search for your favorite artist and their music remakes like \u201cMartin Garrix High on Life FL STUDIO tutorial\u201d by doing you will understand in-depth about where the counter-melody goes where you need an arp, etc.2. Practicing is the key. Don't ever take shortcuts, and know that producing can be very difficult. You will need to be patient and willing to persevere, even when you're having trouble translating what's in your mind (Take a little break and put it again or just explore and learn it in-depth from youtube or google)3. Learning Music Theory Pitch: how high and low a note is.Rhythm: the length of notes and breaks.Scale: notes palette of the track.Why notes sometimes match or sound \u201cwrong\u201d.How to make variants from a melody.How to chain your notes to have a good melody.4. Understanding Basic Music Structure IntroVersePre-chorusChorusBreakdownDrops5. Mixing and Mastering Here the real game starts of sounding professional and premium it all depends on your mixing how you setup you mixers and get the clean sounds so better you learn mixing from some of the channels i know on youtube are (In the Mix, Arcade, Produce Like a pro, Servida and Pyramind, etc)6. Conclusion (Most Important) \u201cBe Original\u201d Do not use loops and samples you can use them but don\u2019t be dependent on them. Music takes time and good execution. It depends on your vision and understanding. Be Patient and Good Luck. Regards, VIDIT MEGHWAL ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming that you know nothing about either music theory or audio engineering\u2014the two dominant composite parts of music production\u2014here's a quick-start guide (key words that I recommend Googling/YouTubing will display in bold; look these up as you see fit to kickstart your self-education): Download a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). A Digital Audio Workstation will be your means of synthesizing sound quickly and within a space that facilitates fast edits and instant playback of your progress at any point in your projects. Think of a DAW as Photoshop for music artists. Bringing audio from analog instruments into your computer will come later; the best thing to do first is loosely familiarize yourself with the tools used to electronically manipulate sound, which will limit you creatively to MIDI clips and YouTube rips (note: there is nothing whatsoever meaningfully restrictive about that limitation). That said...Learn basic music theory, also known as the science of wooing cochleae, using your DAW to apply what you learn as you go. While knowledge of music theory is literally optional for aspiring music producers, it can help pull you out of uninspired ruts along your way to mastery\u2014perhaps even more frequently thereafter. Approaching creative problems logically (when possible) keeps you productive during temporary impairments. Part of your music theory education must include listening more attentively to your favorite music, your least favorite music, and everything else in between and otherwise. Skip this part, and you'll be qualitatively identical to the annoyingly clueless writer who obviously doesn't read.Learn how to write a pop song. Hear me out. Frankly, becoming an expert at a given DAW makes you an expert at that DAW. Likewise, becoming an expert at music theory makes you an expert at music theory. What you're striving to achieve is expertise in storytelling. Music production is nothing without the world's demand for structured musical expression. So learn how to structure musical expressions before you learn how to express yourself musically (for the same reason that you bought a house before buying furniture). I recommend studying and learning how to write pop songs because they're simple, moronically predictable samples of undeniable musical coherence. Trust me, the pursuit of Mozart's songwriting secrets is an endless journey compared to figuring out what lands most often in music charts. You'll have a much better time spending less time mastering something of genuine value that will serve as your foundation for every bit of subsequent progress.Learn all about sound design. You'll quickly realize the value of sound design savvy when your perfectly structured song with beautiful melodies, epic crescendos and chilling harmonies is still boring as hell.Get involved with a music production community. Do everything and listen to everyone. Find a hobbyist/budding professional who really impresses you, and kindly network with and/or through them to the point where you find a mentor figure. Once again: do everything and listen to everyone. Your first couple of years will be lumped together by a future you into a duration you'll look back on fondly as 'that time when you sucked at music production'. Mentors and peers will keep this duration endurable and fulfilling, therefore short (relatively).This really is only the pre-surface, but you should know now how to proceed from here. Leave with this in your head: everything that you learn will be pointless if ever and while you're unwilling to work. Proof that the thought of becoming an expert at anything is widely romanticized can be found in the vast number of people who tried and quit within practically the same gesture. They're consumers; we're producers. That's how the world works. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question, if you mean producing your own music it's about finding your own unique sound and sculpting songs that play into this. Things such as tonal choices, certain rhythms, song structure, lyrical content. You need to find things that create cohesion from track to track but don't all sound like the same song. Music production is the ability to put together ideas and make a song sound like it was \u201cmeant to be\u201d. If it is producing other people's music, you need to have enough experience, vision and knowledge of music concepts to help a band achieve their full potential. Producers are able to make artistic suggestions and descisions that help a band sculpt their sound. Producers also know how live/performed music translates to a recorded format. Some bands don't realise that their stage sound is probably a bit different to their recorded sound and the studio recordings require a bit of tweaking here and there. Either way you kind of need to know enough about common pop instruments in a playability and tonal sense to be able to produce music that is decent. In opposition to that it is also about knowing the \u201cgenre defining characteristics\u201d that you or the band you are producing are going for OR producing music that pushes boundaries and mixing/matching things that you think sound cool. It's all about being unique and original and paying homage to previous artists that may have influenced you or taking an approach that challenges things? Learn how to analyse song structure, pick tones, learn chords, learn different guitar sounds, learn bass approaches. Mess with drum beats and try to find good samples. Learn how vocal harmonies work. Listen broad and then narrow things down. Be able to zoom in on things but also appreciate the music as a whole. Grow, learn, meet people and surround yourself with like-minded individuals and groups/bands. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Whether you are musical instrument player like(Harmonica,Guitar,Piano or Fluet) ,Singer or DAW user. There are many practical steps tips , you can take to advance toward your Music career goal . My personal suggestion is that you should take a paper and pen and write all the points answer in paper. Over the years, by observing musicians make their way in the world, I\u2019ve noticed certain kinds of thinking and behavior that works well. I\u2019ve distilled these habits into the principles below. These are lifestyle recommendations, ways to think about and deal with the world. 1. Know yourself\u2014-Know both your strengths and weaknesses. Know what you have to offer the professional world. Get feedback from colleagues, teachers, and mentors,fans. Their suggestions and advice can help you chart the path that\u2019s best for you. 2. Get to know your industry\u2014\u2014Get savvy. Your research should include both talking to colleagues and mentors as well as reading about the arts and the music profession. Stay current by reading relevant music trade journals, blogs, and websites speci\ufb01 c to your particular areas of interest. Reading this book is a great start! 3. Network\u2014\u2014get out and exchange information and ideas with others. When you share career and job information with colleagues, they reciprocate. Networking happens everywhere: at rehearsals, backstage at concerts, in supermarkets, at party and at most social gatherings. Even if you are shy, you can \ufb01 nd a style of networking to suit your personality. 4. Research your options\u2014\u2014Information leads to opportunities. Read other musicians\u2019 bios for ideas about grants, competitions, festivals, and performance possibilities. You can \ufb01nd bios on musicians\u2019 websites, blogs, CD liner notes, and in concert programs. Check online for local arts calendar listings to \ufb01 nd out what other musicians at your career stage are doing. Make research a habit: schedule time each week to catch up on what\u2019s going on in the profession. 5. Cultivate an attitude\u2014\u2014Be positive,\ufb02exible, and professional. Keep your ego in check; you need to be able to deal well with both rejection and acceptance. People want to work with those who are pleasant, optimistic, and inspiring. Remember that your attitude is a big part of your professional image. 6. Assess your interpersonal skills\u2014\u2014Clean up your act. We\u2019ve all suffered disappointments and dif\ufb01culties in life. Get whatever kind of help you need by asking your loved ones. Tips on Tuning Up Your Interpersonal Skills \u2022 Before going to sleep each night, think back over the day. Review your behavior and interactions with others. Ask yourself what you would choose to do differently. Be honest. Envisioning new patterns of behavior is the \ufb01rst step to making positive change. 7. Think like an entrepreneur\u2014\u2014 This means thinking creatively about what you have to offer and how you can put your musical skills and experience to work, creating opportunities for yourself. Spend time brainstorming with friends and colleagues. 9. Have both short-term and long-term goals \u2014\u2014Articulating your goals is important. You can\u2019t get somewhere if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. Having realistic short-term goals, for each month or each week, will help keep you focused and motivated. Meeting short-term goals is the best way to work toward your long-term dream. At the end of each chapter there are practical prompts to help you determine your next short-term goals and action steps. 10. Feed your soul.\u2014\u2014How do you recharge and renew your creativity? What inspires you? Pay attention to what helps recharge your imagination and what helps keep your spirit alive. Whether you rebalance by attending to your spirituality, your family life, favorite hobbies, or by communing with nature, make sure that you are taking good care of your spirit. Remind yourself of why you got involved in music in the \ufb01rst place. Your most basic reasons for being in music are crucial factors to keep you moving forward in your career. Keeping tabs on your motivation\u2014on the essence of what music means to you\u2014should help sustain you throughout your career. ",

And it\u2019s a good idea to learn the basics of music theory and songwriting terms.If you just want to make your own music, pretty much any DAW software like FL Studio or Logic Pro will suffice. Either way there is no substitute for knowing what the hell you are doing. Get a book on the software and just crush that book until you know the software front to back. Get a few midi capable synths so you can get experience syncing up audio tracks and MIDI. This is an often overlooked skill. One of the ways that I vastly improved my production skills was to set a goal for myself. I resolved to write and record and finish one song every week for a year. This forced me to learn how to make fast decisions. And get the tracking, overdubs and mixdown done in sn orderly fashion. I made a lot of bad songs! But you can learn from mistakes. What doesn\u2019t work, what does, and what surprises you. ",

The people doing the production had often been doing it for some time, and would probably have worked their way up from a tape operator, via being an engineer to becoming the producer.

And it\u2019s you that\u2019s in charge or your home studio. You may need to do this without the opportunity to work your way up in the recording studio, often without anyone to guide you at all. So, you may be unsure about whether you can learn music production on your own. Can I Learn Music Production on My Own? The answer is yes, but you need to to find the right resources to help you.

Become familiar with all the features and what they do. find a youtube channel that does tutorials on how to do stuff with it, and try to do some. It might be hard or confusing, but the only way to get better at something is to keep trying. If you can try learning it with friends, too. That way you have other people that can help you find new tricks, and all that stuff. Multiple minds working at something is better than one. Be Patient!! Unless you are a God, it takes a considerable amount of time to become proficient at music production. A lot of people will say \u201cdo music every day if you can.\u201d I agree completely with this. You will notice gradual improvement as the months pass. Good luck ",

I learned every DAW available which gave me more options creatively, I learned music theory & how to apply it, I studied the musical techniques of those who inspired me to want to learn music production in the first place, I took advantage of the tools available to me on the internet like tutorial videos, & I also read alot then applied the knowledge I gained from the books I read & general reading i did on music production forums.

Make it sound calm or wild or however you want, but play with it and keep trying to improve and build on it. Then when you get tired, you\u2019re done. Leave it and go do something else. The next day, repeat this process, and if possible, try using some different techniques. This attempt will probably not sound great either, but the point is to improve from day one. In reality, days 1\u2013100 might all be on the same level of quality, but keep at it! Persistence is key. Not over days or weeks or even months, but over years, you will refine your technique and develop your own style. This is how I\u2019ve taught myself music prouction. I\u2019ve been at it a little over three years now, and there\u2019s always something more to strive for, but lately I\u2019ve reached a significantly higher level of quality relative to what I have been capable of, and that is a very rewarding feeling.

Alternatively, you can go to a public college or university and finish a degree in audio production, which will qualify you not only to work as a music engineer but also in broadcast radio or TV, live theater and film, advertising. Yes it cosgts money, but you\u2019d have access to the latest tech and to people who will provide the performances that you can practice engineering. ",

I think that the best way to learn music production is in a way in which it's fun for you. The reason why I say this is because I have always been an avid reader. For me, it's a pleasure to pick up a book or manual and learn to do something, it's rather simple as all I have to do is read, interpret and do the process. Unfortunately, my method is not pleasurable for everyone. Others may insist on having an individual physically showing them or others and also myself might prefer videos. Learning is a simple process of finding material that fascinates you and then practicing what you've learned. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re a totL beginner i would say panning intrument tracks to create a stereo mix (bass/ snare drum/ kick drum/ lead vocal in the centre of the mix and guitars/ keyboards and backing vocals panned to different degrees left and right to ensure that they fill the stereo field. Secondly I would recommend using parametric eq to cut frequencies from the tracks to avoid competing freauencies. Low cut to remove unneeded freauencies until a track starts to sound thin and boost (gently) any frequencies needed to help the particular track sit in the mix how you want it. That\u2019s my recommendatiins for starting out - Panning Eq (low cut unneeddd low end and gentle boosts if needed). ",
