            "answer_text": "It's just a law of nature, like gravity. Specifically when you learn to sing, you get those natural harmonics (overtones) working FOR you by proper vocal placement. Which can only be achieved with the help of a good teacher. Happy hunting. Try good local University music departments, but bring your checkbook ! BTW, the only way to learn proper technique is one on one real time. Yes it costs money. Doesn't everything ? ",
