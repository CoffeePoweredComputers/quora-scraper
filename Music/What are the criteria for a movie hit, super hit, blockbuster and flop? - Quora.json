            "answer_text": "Piles of money. The bigger the piles, the bigger the hit. Think of it this way. Say the pile of money it took to make the movie is the size of a small car, maybe a mini Cooper. This is what the size of the profit pile must be for the movie to be successful. Most movies have two such piles, the second being the cost of marketing and distribution. A hit movie would return a pile of money the size of a pickup truck. Anything smaller would be a moderate success. A super hit would be the size of a semi tractor trailer and a blockbuster would be the size of a freight train. A flop would be anything that comes back with a mini sized or smaller pile. My analogy works as long as you keep in mind that the size of the initial vehicle determines how big the final vehicle must be. If its initial pile was only the size of a kid\u2019s toy car, but it returned a pile the size that pickup, it would be considered wildly successful. Think Blair Witch. A rule of thumb I recall is that a movie needs to double its cost to be successful. That\u2019s why the analogy uses two minis as a start. But a film like The Last Jedi is not considered a hit unless it makes back much more than that due to the notoriety of the brand. The Last Jedi is expected to have such success, Star Wars did not. There\u2019s a nice listing of production budget vs. box office here: Movie Budgets, Most Expensive Movies, Most Profitable Movies, Biggest Money-Losing Movies The two biggest flops on that list are The Lone Ranger and John Carter.

            "answer_text": "As Todd Woods already said: money. Money plus media coverage, to be more precise. If we\u2019ll simplify it to the formula, we\u2019ll see, that for movies with budgets over $50mln: Movie that earned more than 4x budget+marketing - is a super hit. Movie that earned more than 2.5x budget+marketing - is a blockbuster. Movie that earned more than 1.5x budget+marketing - would be a minor success. Movie that earned less than budget+marketing - would be a flop. Movie that earned less than 3/4 of budget+marketing - would be a box office bomb. For movies from $1 mln to $49mln: Movie that earned more than 2x budget+marketing - is a hit. Movie that earned more than 1.3x budget+marketing - would be a minor success. For movies under $1 mln: Movie that earned 2x budget+marketing - is a great success. Movie that earned more than budget+marketing - is a big success. Movie that received distribution and earned at least something in the office - is a success. ",
