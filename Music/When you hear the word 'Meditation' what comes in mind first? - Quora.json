            "answer_text": "The word \u2018meditation\u2019 brings to mind construction of an inner space for oneself in the outer world. If the outer is compared to a sharp\u2014thorned - petalled rose, always in the phase of drop-bloomed despair, the inner is compared to a fresh-blooming Lotus, ever fragrant in the joys\u2019 breeze of Compasionate Care! By polishing the jewel (the mani) within the lotus, lo and behold! \u2026it appears as if the white lotus has taken on a red blush, generally associated with romantic roses! And soon I see that that outer gena rosa now bends toward the-lotus nelumbo almost as if they wished to pair! Thus Now in the second phase of mediation, the celebratory Dhyana, I continue to polish the jewel within the bloom and again, looking through half-close eyes- I see that the shape of my lotus has taken the roundness of a crusted rose and indeed emits a fragrance resembling the latter when in fact it blooms for the lovers of Song of Songs-radiant joy! In the end, when exiting from the samadhi I check the thorns of the rosa-wood- homologized with the outer world of the senses - and behold, the thorns previous piercimg like bloodying spears of despair, now seemed like triumphed gold-laden stamens, announcimg the victory of wine over water , heaven over earth, sukha over dukha and- almost blinding!- resembling but unearthly mirth as the petalls,revived and jubilant mixed with the leaves of the lotus and both (I now see to my great astonishment!) appeared to dance to the Music of the Spheres! After such nights of epiphanies I now see the Outer-World\u2019 but as a Theophany of the Inner! Whether \u2018in \u2018 meditation\u2019 or \u2018out\u2019 all reality carries the fragrance of the Purnam, the Whole, viz. Adha-cum- idam..the systole! Should I reveal more or simple remain dumb, dancing the phalka of joy and allowing the sun -strokes of the many, bringing the moon -coma of Bliss, reading but one love note, written in the hand of Kvan Yin, the compasionate Goddess of love, waving the medicine -herbs of Hers and His, adinfinitum!

            "answer_text": "My honest belief about meditation is that most people are faking meditation. I have never meditated in my life ever, in the traditional sense of the word. I have done a lot of pondering and deep introspection to look at my own psyche and to learn about it. By understanding my own psyche and looking at others\u2019 behavior, I have learned about mind in general. I really do not believe in trying to control the thought process forcibly. I do not believe that, that will ever work, nor is it even possible. There are about 500 different schools of meditation and if they can measure their success by how many out of 100 practitioners achieves enlightenment, I would say that the success rate is low. ",
