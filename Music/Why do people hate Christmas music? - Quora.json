            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give a perspective of someone who only heard this \u201cChristmas music\u201d for the first time in adulthood. Personally, I don't hate Christmas music per se. I hate the ten or so specific Christmas songs every retailer feels obligated to play in a loop from late November. And I did not hate them the first ten times I had to listen to them. I did not like them (I generally don\u2019t care for the 50s music, I can\u2019t tell Bing Crosby from Buddy Holly, and I\u2019ll take Pink Floyd over Elvis any time), but I did not hate them either. But, over time, they got old and then they got grating. And I started getting annoyed by the atonality of \u201clittle drummer boy\u201d, or the ridiculousness of songs about \u201cone-horse open sleighs\u201d played when it\u2019s 70 F outside, there\u2019s not a single horse-drawn sleigh for hundreds of miles in any direction, and most of its listeners have never seen one except in pictures in any event. I\u2019d be less peeved if they at least allowed some variety. Would it kill them to play \u201cWenceslas\u201d or the Carol of the Bells once in a while (preferably in the rendition by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, but I\u2019m not picky?) Anything but the loop of \u201cdrummer boy\u201d / \u201ctwelve days of christmas\u201d / \u201cjingle bells\u201d / \u201cjingle bell rock\u201d / \u201csilver bells\u201d/\u201clast christmas\u201d / \u201csilent night\u201d and then back to start.

            "answer_text": "Personally at least, I don\u2019t hate Christmas music. I hate the kind of Christmas music they play in public. It\u2019s mostly very lounge-y, bland music that get very repetitive. Although there are many Christmas songs they play, due to genre choices it sounds like one really long one that just gets so incredibly old. They never play any classic Christmas carols, I can only assume because there aren\u2019t many uber-famous covers of them, and instead they play much newer, much blander music. I don\u2019t know, I kind of despise Michael Buble myself and that\u2019s like, 86.7% of what they play. If anyone wants to know what kind of Christmas music I do like, by the way, it\u2019s mostly carols, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society. ",
