Playing music on your computer does not necessarilly transmit it over Zoom. Check your settings, make sure that your Zoom is not broadcasting your system sounds. If it is, then yes, your music going out. You could also just text one of your classmates and ask, yeah? But that would be the thing to check. If your mic is picking up the music, or if your Zoom is configured to broadcast your system sounds, then your music could be going out over Zoom. I don't know much about Zoom, but on Skype, you can control whether anything playing on your system sound board goes out over Skype. There must be a way to do it on Zoom too. ",
