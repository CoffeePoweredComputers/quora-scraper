            "answer_text": "What do you mean by containers? The record cover or the record sleeve? The cover is the cardboard with cover art and the sleeve is the paper, plastic, or paper/plastic sleeve the record goes into before going in to the cover. Records are not usually salable or have a small fraction of the value without the cover. The records would be only be salable without a cover if it\u2019s a VERY RARE record that\u2019s desirable. They\u2019re sellable without the sleeve if they were desirable records but it would be a lot of work to sell them. You probably should sell them to a used record dealer or donate them to Goodwill.
