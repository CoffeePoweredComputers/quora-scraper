            "answer_text": "According to the official charts, From Me To You Please Please Me was number one in most charts published at the time, in 1963. An exception was Record Retailer, where it peaked at number two, behind The Wayward Wind by Frank Ifield. Several years later, the UK record Industry and the BBC agreed to recognise an official chart. The one produced by Record Retailer, since renamed Music Week became the basis of this. Record Retailer charts were then retrospectively recognised as the Official Charts back to when they started. This means that Please Please Me has gone down in history as a number two single. ",
