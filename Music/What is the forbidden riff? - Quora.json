            "answer_text": "The \u2018forbidden riff\u2019 is a guitar shop in-joke which began in Denmark Street, London, in about 1973. Guitar-shop workers were fed-up of hearing beginners butcher Stairway to Heaven, Whole lotta love, and various other standards, and then look around for admiration. What\u2019s worse, the people who came in to try out Stairway were well-known as the ones least likely to buy a guitar. So they put up a list of \u2018forbidden songs\u2019, which included the aforementioned, plus some other classics. These lists were copied from shop to shop, and the lists got extended. Smoke on the Water is one of the earliest non-Zeppelin riffs, Seven Nation Army is the most recent to have achieved the doubtful glory of making its way onto them. There is no standard list. If you look like you are going to buy an instrument, most guitar shops will let you play whatever you like. However, if you come in every week with your mates, try a few guitars and play one of the listed songs, they are likely to point to the list on the wall and tell you \u2018time\u2019s up\u2019. What makes these particular riffs and intros especially annoying is: Every beginner guitarist learns themEvery beginner guitarist acts like they think they are the only ones ever to learn themBeginner guitarists usually play them badly.Experienced guitarists are less likely to randomly try out instruments, and more likely to play something interesting that the shop owners haven\u2019t heard before. Want to know if you impressed someone? It\u2019s when they start asking you for advice. If they don\u2019t, you didn\u2019t impress them, no matter how much they say \u2018really good mate\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve heard all day\u2019. Guitar shop workers are mostly guitarists, and they are extremely hard to impress.  Inexperienced guitarist interested in trying out a few guitars, so that his mates can hear him play \u2018Stairway\u2019. \u2026walks into shop. Guitarist: \u201cExcuse me, is it ok if I try\u2026 the guitars?\u201d Shop worker: \u201cHmph\u201d \u2014 points to a couple of cheap guitars with strings caked in grime, which are kept especially for this purpose. Guitarist (sits down. His mates stand up to look in awe): \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been working on. You may recognise it.\u201d Begins first chords of Smoke on the Water. Gets as far as the end of the riff, and immediately switches to Stairway to Heaven. Gets lost at the bit where the mellotron comes in. Guitar shop worker is desperately hoping he won\u2019t hum the mellotron part, or, even worse, whistle. Switches to Seven Nation Army. Guitar shop worker: \u201cThat\u2019s really great mate. Good on you. We erm, well, actually have a policy against those particular songs. Can I interest you in some new strings? Or maybe a pick? I\u2019ve got these stickers you can have for nothing.\u201d Guitarist gets the message, and heads off with his mates to hang around on a street corner.  Experienced guitarist intent on buying a guitar. \u2026walks into shop. Guitarist: \u201cIs Dave in?\u201d Shop worker: \u201cHe\u2019s in the back. Shall I get him for you?\u201d Guitarist: \u201cThat would be really good \u2014 hey didn\u2019t I see you playing at the Guitar and Grog pub last week?\u201d Shop worker: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. With my band the Dead Pigeons.\u201d Guitarist: \u201cFantastic. Dave, you said\u2026\u201d Shop worker: \u201cOn it.\u201d Dave: \u201cHello mate. What can I do for you today?\u201d Guitarist: \u201cI\u2019ve come into a bit of money\u2014not much, mind\u2014 and I want to buy something a bit special\u2014but, I need to say, I really need you to go out on a limb for me on the price. Can you help me on that?\u201d Dave: \u201cWhich guitar was it?\u201d Guitarist: \u201cShow me the one you\u2019d buy.\u201d Dave: \u201cWell, there is a guitar which is a bit special, but we\u2019ve already cut the price right down.\u201d Guitarist: \u201cDave\u2026! It\u2019s me. You\u2019ve got to help a musician.\u201d Dave: \u201cWell, I suppose I could look at the label with you. Yeah, I think we might be able to do something here. But just for you, mind. Don\u2019t go telling anyone else.\u201d \u2026 Negotiation continues. Guitarist eventually leaves shop with a guitar priced 20% below the marked price, which is still 20% more than Dave bought it for. Dave swears that Guitarist is almost bankrupting him. Guitarist swears that he\u2019ll be eating bread roll for a month to pay for it. He then puts the guitar in the back of his Mercedes and drives off.  Experienced guitarists know that the most important part of buying a guitar, assuming it\u2019s the guitar you want, is getting to the right price. Playing forbidden songs, spending the entire afternoon \u2018just trying it out\u2019, or anything else which will annoy the staff, are all eating into the discount. Make friends with everyone. Make your mind up quickly, pay, and leave. And don\u2019t play Stairway. Ever. ",
