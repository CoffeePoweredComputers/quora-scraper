            "answer_text": "I don't normally field requests like this, as I am not the sort of musician at all likely to be hired as an American Idol judge or anything of the kind, but I went against my own habits and had a listen, and also briefly checked out a couple of your other covers.  Your voice has a pleasant, imminently listenable, and inviting quality. If you enjoy singing, you should keep doing it. The basics of the technique are all there, and the pitch is really quite good most of the time; you have a good ear.  Something about the diction, the way the language comes across in your singing, sounds a bit off to me. Without hearing you in person or in a higher-fidelity recording, it's difficult for me to say much more about that. Perhaps you could work with a coach on this? At times, you do not sound fully in control of your own voice from a technical standpoint. The singing seems to come off the breath support at inappropriate times now and again, resulting in occasional pitch problems and some wobbly inflection that you probably don't intend. I love that you take certain risks in your singing, as this shows creativity and originality, but you need to work to develop the technique to really support those risks so that you can realize your intentions fully and confidently.  I agree with Timothy Christian Liu that the expressive quality is at times a bit monotone; this was less the case in a couple of other tracks I listened to. Part of it seems to be the way you're imitating that particular singer, and part of it is probably also just the recording quality.  Remember, practice makes better, so keep at it! And congrats for putting yourself out there to be rated. That takes guts. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I agree that it is thick-skinned to put yourself out there for critique. I coach voice professionally and work with therapeutic recovery of voice, too. I've also co-produced various new artists for a few labels, and written for BMI. I formulated a philosophical principle that I apply to music performance: A great voice can do even a bad song justice, but to do justice to a good voice, it takes a great song. To evaluate voice,  I analyse different domains . Here is my professional criteria for voice evaluation. 1. Technical: all technical aspects, mechanical production of voice, production of music when there is a backing track, posture, breathing2. Innate: the natural quality, range and technique habits of a singer, any indications of unusual vocal quality and range or damage, how they move when they sing, is it difficult to control the voice or not, are there issues the singer wants to tackle, what they want to develop, what they want to \"get rid of\".3. Inherent: what the singer has learned or copied or even practiced, with an instructor or autonomously, whether they had choir or ensemble work, what they self-studied, who they emulate or want to emulate4. Marketability: niche, style, genre, singer's \"loook\", any professional resources (coaches, studios, producers, distributors, online hit counts and comments, unit sales, recorded touring/performance experience, fanbase, etc.). I alway ask a client to do this self-assesment according to this criteria, then I do mine, and we meet up, answers questions to gain clarity, and match our evaluations as a diagnostic approach. So, I would encourage you to do this for yourself, now that you have gotten great critical feedback from others and an overall \"pleasant\" impression.  Personal official impression: definitely keep going in music, but find a vocal coach to extend your range, breath control and dynamic; also work closely with another producer to handle sound engineering issues that might not be doing justice to your voice. I didn't check to see who composed the music and lyrics for this track, but they're quite good, in my opinion, nice structure, nice pace, lyrics flow well and make sense. I like the hook. ",
