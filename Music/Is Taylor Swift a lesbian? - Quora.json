            "answer_text": "That is highly unlikely. Just because her personal life has long been a basket case (in stark contrast to her professional life, btw) doesn't mean she isn't into men. Now, she could be bi. But apart from the unsubstantiated rumors about her and Karlie Kloss, there's zero solid evidence of her having any romantic interest in women. EDIT: And then the Nashville Eyefuck happened. Who knew Reputation was her Listen Without Prejudice? Well, apart from her queer fans, who quickly recognized it as being a very, very gay album. There is no heterosexual explanation for \u201cGorgeous\u201d or \u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied\u201d, and \u201cReady For It?\u201d reads like a kinkier, more aggressive \u201cFreedom \u201890\u201d \u2014 you know, the song where George Michael was trying to tell us he was gay without actually coming out. It seems to me that at least some of her relationships with men were real, probably including with Joe (awkward\u2026). But consider this: Taylor\u2019s contract runs out in November, and she has all the money and leverage she will ever need. Taylor\u2019s mic-melter of a performance of \u201cDress\u201d was blatantly and shamelessly targeted at Karlie, the woman queer fans have been linking her to for years, and someone at E! News felt emboldened to make an explicit link on Twitter. (And you better believe that shit was cleared with Legal in every way that mattered. Maybe they even got direct permission on the QT.) The body language in that selfie, the fact that Karlie left with an obvious hickey, members of the Kloss family following Kaylor fan accounts\u2026 there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that this was as close to a public coming out as possible, with just enough plausible deniability to keep some of Taylor\u2019s dumber fans fooled for a couple more months. I still think Taylor is bi, and possibly polyamorous. But unless Taylor or Karlie decides to sue E! For outing them, I think the case is proven: Taylor\u2019s here, she\u2019s queer, and we better get used to it.  Edit after Miss Americana: Because of her \u201cgay pride\u201d comment while discussing the \u201cME!\u201d video, I am now 100% sure that she\u2019s a lesbian, not bi. There\u2019s really no other interpretation \u2014 she came out in the documentary. Now is she still with Karlie\u2026 we may not know for a while. But she\u2019s officially out in a way even straight people can understand. ",

            "answer_text": "No she is not a lesbian because she have dated many guys in the past. She just have a lot of friends that are girls. When she goes on dates she goes with a guy. I think if she was she would tell the media because she had a lot of confidence past the years. Also since they have legal gay marriage in all 50 states I think she would have more confidence especially when a lot of people are supporting it. Since a lot of people are becoming gay/ lesbian or bi after they legal gay marriage in all 5o states. I don't think Taylor would be shy about it because she had talking about her broken heart in basically all her songs why should be scared about telling the media. ",
