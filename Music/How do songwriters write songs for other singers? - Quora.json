            "answer_text": "Great question! First of all, it\u2019s a myth that professional songwriters always write from personal accounts in their lives. Songwriters draw inspiration from their lives, the lives of friends and family, stories they\u2019ve read, on and on. In fact a famous songwriter once said, If I actually lived through everything I wrote about, I would have been dead long ago. Keeping that in mind, it should be a little more clear that professional songwriters know how to take a story or theme and make it their own. Or in other words, they understand how to take a story that isn\u2019t directly personal and bring to it an intimate emotion that makes it feel like it belongs to the person singing the song. Maybe to better illustrate what I\u2019m saying, let me tell you how we wrote songs for Selena Gomez. Back around 2008 just as Selena was being signed to Hollywood Records, my writing partners and I were just coming off of a success with Miley Cyrus. So we were asked to write some songs for Selena. When we sat down to write a song called \u201cFalling Down\u201d, we didn\u2019t know much about her. I had a track (instrumental) I had created based on the direction the label had given us. Ted Bruner had come up with a melody and title that we liked, and Gina Schock was working to come up with lyric ideas that supported the title. I went online to read about Selena, what was going on in her life and what stories were getting a lot of attention about her. The rumor at the time was that she was dating Nick Jonas (I think it was Nick, but it was definitely one of the Jonas brothers). If the stories were true, it was a quick romance that didn\u2019t go well. While Ted and Gina were going back and forth with lyrics, I was throwing out bits of the story I was reading from news outlets, fans, gossip, whatever. Anything I said that stuck out or caught their interest, they wove it into the lyric somehow. In the end the song had a kind of loose intersection between Selena\u2019s quick romance and the trappings of Hollywood stardom. When she got the song she loved it because she could relate to the lyric. Interestingly, Selena wanted to write songs with us but the label refused. She would come in and track vocals, but they wouldn\u2019t let her write the songs. They felt that if we all got too chummy writing with her, the album would quickly get out of the label\u2019s control. That had happened to them previously with another artist, so we never wrote directly with her. We ended up with four songs on that album, and we just drew from things we read about her to create the lyrics. So being able to write songs for other singers is just part of the skill set that professional songwriters must develop. And often, once an artist gets a song that they like, they may go through and personalize a lyric further.  ",

            "answer_text": "All I know is how *I* do it.  I may start with a singer in mind. Let's say Norah Jones. I will listen to a recent body of what she has out. I may google her and see what's happening in her life. Don't want to write about growing up in California if she grew up in Texas, or about the joys of marriage if she just got divorced. When I'm done- I have to be able to hear her sing it.  I will typically get someone who sounds like the artist if I'm making a song demo to PITCH. Many artists are extremely insulated and the only way to get your song to them is for a rep/agent/producer/publisher to HEAR them cutting the song. So I put the bread crumbs close together. (Many good session vocalists on demosinger.com) Another thing to consider is range. I can pitch a two-octave spread to Martina, but not Miranda.  But mostly I just write from my heart and hope my passion makes a way for the song!  Good thing I love the process best- because this is something you can really be passionate about even if you don't get a cut!  It's so much fun! If you have a local singer approach you- see if they want to be involved in the writing process!  It's fun to cowrite with artists even if they don't write they are full of ideas! I hope that helps?
