            "answer_text": "Update July 2018: FL Studio 20 will work on OSX. The learning curve is about the same maybe slightly in favor of FL Studio. Logic just has more features but to get started you should only focus on the essentials. Logic Pro X is a superior program for audio editing . FL studio has a slightly faster work flow but is mostly midi based. The platform is also a major consideration as FL studio works only on windows while logic only on Mac. Most current genres of music ( I.e. EDM, trap, dub step, future )use FL studio For composition. Plus the stock sounds in FL studio Will make your tracks sound like the hits on radio without too much tweaking . ",

            "answer_text": "I actually think that Logic Pro is much easier. If you\u2019re used to a traditional track system (like Garageband, Logic, Cubase, or Pro Tools has), then the FL sequencer can take a little bit longer to wrap your head around. As others have already mentioned, it all comes down to what kind of workflow you\u2019re looking for. I recommend trying both. ",
