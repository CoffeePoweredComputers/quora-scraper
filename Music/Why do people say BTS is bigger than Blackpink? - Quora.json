            "answer_text": "Bluntly put, it\u2019s because they are. Views and streams aren\u2019t always an accurate determination of someone\u2019s reach or success. Some argue that BlackPink is more popular based on views, but that\u2019s not really true. BlackPink are still rookies no matter what their fans and YGE think. They\u2019ve been active (and I use that loosely) for 2 going on 3 years. BTS has been around officially since 2013 and technically before that as trainees and individually as well. While BlackPink does have separate works from their time as trainees, the amount in their discography can\u2019t be compared to sunbae groups like BTS. BP literally has 9 songs officially to their name, 10 if you count SOLO, while BTS has over 90 songs all together. Plus, and this isn\u2019t to be an ass, BTS broke records without a big name. BlackPink was highly anticipated due to being from YGE, not necessarily because of their skill. If they came from a smaller label, no one would probably hype them as much and they might not have experienced any success at all. BTS on the other had came from a small label and their debut was surrounded by controversy (Glam). They\u2019ve broke records despite that and grew. To me, BlackPink was highly revered due to label stanning, not because they had their own fans. Label stans are huge on supporting any group from the label they bias, even if they wouldn\u2019t like the group had they been at another label. With that said, BTS has a much bigger and wider spread fanbase. This isn\u2019t to upset Blinks or say there aren\u2019t any around the world. But in all honesty, there aren\u2019t as many as people think. Even just looking at where YouTube streams come from will show a rough estimate of their popularity in certain countries. BlackPink doesn\u2019t have that reach while BTS does. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they are in fact, bigger then Blackpink. I suppose you think they are bigger, because they have more views. Well, they do have more views, but I think this is because Blackpink has way less songs, so fans are forced to listen to the same songs, while BTS has like, 200 songs. I also think it also DDU-DU-DDU-DU has more views then DNA because DNA was released in 2017 while DDU-DU-DDU-DU IN 2018 and DDU-DU-DDU-DU is their latest song. Views is literally only thing Blackpink defeats BTS in. If we compare the social media that they have in common, BTS takes the lead except for IG. Which makes sense, since BTS doesn\u2019t have individual Instagram and isn\u2019t really active on Instagram. Just like Blackpink isn\u2019t really active on Twitter, BTS isn\u2019t active on IG. Blackpink Twitter:  BTS Twitter:  Blackpink vLive:  BTS vLive:  Blackpink Facebook:  BTS Facebook:  Blackpink Amino:  BTS Amino:  Blackpink Quora:  BTS Quora:  While Blackpink has a lot of views, BTS has a lot of international fame. BTS is without doubt, the most know worldwide. Blackpink is getting there, but BTS has even won awards like the Billboard Music Awards. A lot of artists recognize them and a lot of Western artists like them, like Camilla Cabello and Charlie Puth. Let\u2019s look at the album achievements of their latest albums, Kill This Love and Map Of The Soul: Persona: Kill This Love:  Map Of The Soul: Persona:  Look at this, BTS has multiple albums on there and the most sold album ever is from them: List of best-selling albums in South Korea - Wikipedia Now let\u2019s look at some other things:              But the groups aren\u2019t that comparable. BTS has been in the industry for 3 years longer then Blackpink. Blackpink not even have a full album but BTS has around 200 songs. BTS has done way more collaborations, went to more awards shows and done so much more stuff. So people say BTS is bigger, because BTS is actually bigger. I am no way hating on Blackpink and I\u2019m not looking down on their achievements. ",
