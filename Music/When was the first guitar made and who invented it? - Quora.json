            "answer_text": "Original question: Who created the first guitar patent? Probably William B. Tilton. The standard acoustic guitar design has been around for centuries, long before the first patent laws were written to protect inventors\u2019 rights. There have been a huge number of innovations that improved on the original guitar - bracing, tuners, saddles, bridges, truss rods, etc. - and then there are innovations in amplification from the first use of steel strings to resonator cones and then onboard pickups and full electric guitars. C.F. Martin & His Guitars, 1796-1873, a book by Philip Gura, discusses a US patent #8,338 by William Tilton from 1851 for bracing techniques for violins, guitars, and other stringed instruments to increase the strength of the top, Patent #10,380 from 1854 for the innovation of a guitar tailpiece that further improved string tension. Tilton also received Patent #14,378 from 1856 for a circular metal disc in the soundhole, plus another patent that covered slanted alignment of the wood grain for improved tone. These are probably the first patents that specifically call out guitar applications. Walter Carter\u2019s The Martin Book: A Complete History of Martin Guitars discusses the early days of the C.F. Martin Company, describing the earliest instruments with an option for \u201cpatent screws\u201d used on 2 instruments sold in 1836 when Martin was a merchant in New York rather than a producer. These are elaborate scrolled tuners similar to those found on violins, raising the value of the guitar by 50% compared to wooden pegs. ",

Over 500 years ago you had the viola da mano and the viola da gamba. One was for plucking and one was for bowing.

The first patent for the electric guitar was awarded to George Beauchamp for a guitar he made with partner Adolph Rickenbacker in 1931. A lot of other inventors and guitar makers were working on electric guitars at the same time. Famous electric guitar makers included Les Paul who pioneered the solid body guitar made by Gibson Guitars. In 1951 Leo Fender invented the Fender Telecaster. This guitar, together with the Gibson Les Paul, the Fender Telecaster, and the Gibson SG would make solid-body electric guitars hugely popular.

What we know is that, with the exception of the nylon-strings, (it had gut strings back then) the first guitar resembling the guitars we have today, is the classical Spanish guitar. Original from Spain, the guitar evolved from the guitarra latina of the 16th century, that had a slim, waisted figure, 4 courses/7 strings, viola tuning pegs, and round soundhole. By the 18th century the guitar had evolved to having 6 single strings, a broader body design, and back tuners replaced the pegs. Antonio Torres is known to have done many of the body changes that led to todays modern guitar. ",

Pictured below are some of the precursors to the modern guitar:         ",

An Arabic fretless instrument with 5 strings. It was brought to Europe by the people of Caliphate of Cordoba (1017\u20131024). The first guitars had also five strings, and the low E was added afterwards. Unlike the oud, the guitars were fitted with frets. The eastern music uses scales which involve intervals smaller than semi-tones, so fretless instruments are needed. The western music uses semitones as the smallest interval so frets of semitones were the standart for stringed instruments. ",

I\u2019ve heard that the origin of the word guitar is \u201ckithara\u201d, which was, I believe, an ancient Greek lyre with a tremolo. But then again there are may other words that claim to be the origin of \u201cguitar\u201d. I think the thing to realize is that the guitar is really a very simple instrument. It\u2019s multiple strings strung across a fingerboard fretted at half steps. Most cultures in the world came up with something like this independently, and more likely than not in most cases it comes down to parallel evolution rather than common ancestry. ",
