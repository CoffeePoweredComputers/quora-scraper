            "answer_text": "To be blunt, rock and roll was born out of the experiences of Black Americans who, being excluded from mainstream life and \"The American Dream\", created an art form that spoke of their joys, sorrows, pain, and hope. It's roots were established in the spiritual music of the slaves, and in the blues that resulted from living under \"Jim Crow\". It was fashioned in blood and pain and fire, shaped with love, and was the primary outlet of their expression for many years, as it developed into jazz, boogie woogie, jive, and then (through artists like Little Richard) became the rock and roll that people all over the earth could identify with. It is truly Americas greatest cultural resource and export. ",

            "answer_text": "As with an attempt to define any musical genre, there are some basic descriptions which may be applied, but those rules are never hard and fast. In the case of rock and roll, it is generally viewed as: originating in the 1950s as an amalgam of various genres, predominantly, blues, R&B, and country.driven by a drum-based backbeat in which emphasis is placed on beats 2 and 4.played on electric instruments, including guitar, bass, and keyboards.As I said, though, as soon as one tries to define a genre, someone will \u201cbreak the rules\u201d and stretch the definition. For example, in the mid-\u201950s, artists like Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Fats Domino were generally viewed as some of rock and roll\u2019s fundamental artists, but were piano-driven instead of guitar-driven.
