            "answer_text": "Step 1 RECORDING THE SOUND DIGITALLY: First you'll need to get the sound itself into a digital recording. If your Casio has any output jacks (RCA, headphone, etc), you'll want to connect the keyboard via the appropriate cable to a computer. This can be done with an audio interface or, depending on the computer/device, the cable might plug-in directly (which would probably be the case for a headphone jack and a standard laptop/desktop computer). If there\u2019s no output jack on your Casio, then you will need to record the sound with a microphone from the keyboard\u2019s speaker. This can be a really cool way to get the sound as well. If you have to go this route, there are obviously many different things to consider RE: microphone choice, equipment, etc. But to keep it simple, any microphone will do. Again, you might be able to use a USB microphone, or a traditional microphone plugged into an interface, which then connects with your computer. I think the easiest way to think of your microphone approach is to use the analogy of a digital camera: You can take any picture you want with any kind of camera. However, the better the lens, the higher the digital resolution, the better the processor and the combination of these factors will result in a clearer, \u201ctruer\u201d picture. Some cameras are also better for specific situations. Recording with microphones for digital is pretty much the same. Whether or not you care about velocity, just make an individual recordings for each sound, and label them for their appropriate pitch and velocity. If you want to save time, you can only record a few pitch/velocity samples, and then when you move into step 2, have the software automatically re-pitch the samples to run the whole length of a keyboard (or beyond if you want to go above and below typical piano octaves). Step 2 GETTING YOUR RECORDINGS INTO A SAMPLER: Well, this part of the answer has a massive potential for solutions, and none of them are wrong. But what you will need to do now is to take your recordings into a sampling software and map them to the keyboard, drum pad, or device that you\u2019d like to trigger those samples. Companies like Native Instruments have whole suites of sampling software (Battery is one). Most Digital Audio Workstations like Apple\u2019s Logic, Ableton\u2019s Live, and many more have built in sampling plug-ins that assist in mapping out the sounds. I\u2019d recommend finding the software that suits your needs / budget and not get bogged down by choice yet; get your samples mapped and have fun creating ASAP. YouTube is an obvious choice for learning the ins-and-outs of the softwares you could use. From here, non velocity sensitive samples will quickly and easily map across a virtual keyboard. Each bell sound would then correspond to the appropriate pitch and note on a piano roll. Being in a digital space, you could then map each note to a drum pad, external sensor, or whatever your heart desires. I hope this helps - go out there and make some sweet, sweet music. PS - There is hardware that exists that can automatically do this for you (I think Arturia and Korg make such hardware samplers). Depending on your motivation, there might already be a sample of your particular keyboard out there. I\u2019d recommend doing it yourself, to maintain a sense of personal agency in acquiring and using the sound, but it\u2019s up to you! Happy hunting! ",

            "answer_text": "Connect the audio output of the keyboard to your sampler or PC, hit record, and then play your keyboard. Then, you\u2019ll have to trim the silence from the beginning and end of each sample. If you need a free audio editor for Windows, try Audacity. It\u2019s really good. You say it has only one velocity sample, but then you say it has multiple \u201clayers\u201d including hard and soft. Not sure what you mean. ",
