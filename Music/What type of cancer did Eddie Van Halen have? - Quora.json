To answer the question, Edward Van Halen had cancer of the tongue diagnosed in 2000. He had 1/3 of his tongue surgically removed, and the cancer reportedly spread into his esophagus. So this was reported widely as \u201cthroat cancer\u201d. There was a rumor out there that the cancer had relapsed and that EVH was getting regular radiation therapy in Germany to keep this in check. I guess at least the first part was true. Recent reporting indicated that he just died with brain metastases. EVH early on attributed the cancer to his habit of holding picks in his mouth; many others attributed to his years of smoking and drinking. Its possible human papilloma virus (which is associated with some throat cancers and most cervical cancers) was a contributing factor. ",
