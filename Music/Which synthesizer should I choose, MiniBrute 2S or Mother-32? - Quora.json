            "answer_text": "I own both and while I can\u2019t tell you which you should buy, I can point out what\u2019s different about them and what I like about each. Mother-32 pluses: You get the classic creamy Moog sound that you really can\u2019t get anywhere else, especially at this price. When making simple patches and with minimal use of the patch bay, you can get great sounds without a huge learning curve. The patch bay is fairly easy to understand (I had never used patch bays before I got my M32), and there are nearly unlimited creative ways to use it, if you want to go down that rabbit hole. And why wouldn\u2019t you? On the down side, I never liked the sequencer very much. Too fiddly for me and too many button combination pushes to get into the different functions. I also found the Moog doesn\u2019t always play well with other modular gear as far a pitch CV goes. MiniBrute 2S pluses: Killer sequencer functionality that lets you sequence not only pitch but also other parameters. Lots of knobs to twiddle, more feature-full envelopes, and a nasty sounding filter for aggressive sounds. Patch bay is large and pretty easy to understand. In the end, they are both awesome instruments and a good value. To me it all boils down to the sound you are going for. I am lucky enough to have both so I didn\u2019t have to choose. ",
