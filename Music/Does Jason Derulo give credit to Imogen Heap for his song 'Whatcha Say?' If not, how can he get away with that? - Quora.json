            "answer_text": "No, he does not, at least not in the sense that it isn't \"Whatcha Say by Jason Derulo feat. Imogen Heap\". However, it is widely known that the chorus is from her track Hide and Seek.  The method used here is called sampling, where only a certain part of a track is used. Typically whoever wants to use a sample pays the original writer/artist a sum to use it. If the sum is high enough, the writer/artist may willingly relinquish their right to be given credit. According to Imogen Heap's Facebook page (which may or may not be legitimate), Imogen Heap did in fact give her permission for Jason Derulo to use the sample. That being said, I don't know whether he credits her inside the album book where all the other musical credits are typically listed. (Personally, I have no desire to buy the album and find out.) ",

Rotem, legally acquired a license to the sample prior to the song's release and that she was extremely happy with the terms of her compensation. Imogen Heap does not receive a \"featuring\" credit pursuant to the terms of this agreement. Heap is credited as a co-writer in the official publishing information, along with Rotem, Derulo, Kisean Anderson, and J-Lex. When I saw her in concert, she specifically gave a shout out to Derulo and \"Watcha Say\", and she expressed how happy she was that \"Hide and Seek\" has, in her words, \"taken on a life of its own.\" In short, the sample is licensed and legal.
