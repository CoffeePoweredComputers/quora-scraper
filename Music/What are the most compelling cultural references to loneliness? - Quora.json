            "answer_text": "I'm a big fan of the \"Alone in a Crowd\" meme. Sometimes, one feels loneliest surrounded by others, not by oneself. This brand of loneliness penetrates the deepest because one can overcome solitude but not loneliness in a crowd. Company cures solitude, but no cure exists for feeling lost and adrift in company of others.  This soul-crushing form of loneliness takes on many meanings when we consider it in the context of our lives.  \"Alone in a Crowd\" as an allegory for contemporary life. I find this meme so compelling because of its prevalence in contemporary society. In our busy, increasingly urbanized lives, to-do lists, rather than friendships, dominate our lives.[1] Urbanites, young and old, rush to and from home and work, oblivious to the lives surrounding them.  You can see these themes in postmodern literature and art. American Psycho (Bret Eaton Ellis) proves a great example of the side-effects of urbanized loneliness. Patrick Bateman trolls the New York City streets and trading floors, never truly connecting with anyone. This sheer isolation metamorphoses into psychotic numbness that leads to his murderous rampages.  \"Alone in a Crowd\" as a representation of depression.  Depression crushes the soul because it's all in your mind. It's a disease that you can't muster the energy or desire to treat. You feel utterly alone and misunderstood. When loneliness becomes a disease, it's called depression.Many depressed people report feeling alone in a crowd.  We see this feeling in action in several contexts: In Titanic, Rose feels overwhelmed by others' presence and the unyielding feeling that nobody crew about her. The feeling becomes so powerful that she runs out and almost kills herself.In Sweeney Todd, you can see that nobody cares:    An excerpt from a personal anecdote:Many times in life I have felt all alone even in the company of others. It just is the way life is. We come into the world alone and we leave the world alone and in between we live our life trying our best to fit in and find our way.[2] \"Alone in a Crowd\" as a metaphor for outcasts and oddities. Loneliness can also mean difference. Sometimes the difference takes ta physical form such as gender or race, sometimes it takes an internal form such as social class or religion. Regardless of form and shape, differences can make us feel like the people milling around us cannot understand our world. If the mainstream society does not accept you, you are alone in a crowd. Conforting people--normal people--surround you, the interloper, the oddity. Rejection breeds loneliness.  Sometimes the loneliest place on earth is in a crowd. ________[1] Robert Putnam argues that civil engagement and social clubs have reached an all-time low in America, endangering democracy.

            "answer_text": "My favorite cultural reference to loneliness is the Japanese horror film, Kairo, remade into a horribly American horror film \ufeffPulse, which is fun, but does not have the lasting impression that \ufeffKairo will leave on you. I think what sets \ufeff\ufeffKairo apart from it's American counterpart and what makes it an exceptional visual essay on loneliness is the context of the societies that the two films were made in.  In the Japanese society, overcrowding is becoming the norm, but with it, so is the \"alone in the crowd\" theme that Cristina Hartmann mentioned above.  So with that societal background, the film becomes even more haunting as people \"die\" or become ghosts in the machine, even when they are not alone. Initially, the play is on people who are alone, but as the film progresses, two of the protagonists slip away from the mainland and end up on a ship somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, looking for a place that hasn't been touched by this widespread internet haunting.  The final shot is the two of them in a room and one turns to ash (as everyone who is haunted does) while the other talks about being alone, with only you, my best friend. It's very haunting because even caring, loving, fighting for her friend doesn't keep him from feeling the same loneliness that consumes everyone in the film. The other fascinating little visual cue in the film that is partially a side note and partially an explanation of what is happening, is a computer science experiment that is tracking \"ghosts in the machine.\"  For those that don't know, the term refers to bits of code in computer science that stick together for reasons unknown to the programer or anything else.  They don't effectively do anything, but they are an anomaly because they are unplanned and effectively create themselves. This computer science experiment shows a visual indicator of these ghosts as white dots on a black stream, that never touch each other no matter how much they move around. (Note: I may be mistaken about this detail as it's been awhile since I've seen the film.  They either never touch, or when they do they disappear, and I can't remember which).  The point though is that we (humans) are social animals and we are heading into a period in our progression as a species in which we are having a harder and harder time socializing in real, physical interactions. Oh, and the American film doesn't go into any of this subtext, so just rent the Japanese original...unless you just want a kind of creepy end of the world flick without subtext, in which case rent the American flick.
