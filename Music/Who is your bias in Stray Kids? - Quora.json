            "answer_text": "\u00bb First of all, I love all of them and most of them are good bias wreckers but my appreciation/ admiration for each go on different extents and reasons so here we go~\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc96\u2728 8. Yang Jeongin (I.N)  \ud83e\udd8a Let's start off with honestly, I.N was the member I found weird & a guy that I didn't understand the hype however the more I watched crack videos & programs the more I loved his personality & pics. It was then when I knew why he was being hyped up although. . . . I still don't like his voice but I don't hate it, I still can listen to it. It's just I don't know what to feel about it, more room for improvement since right now he doesn't excel in any factor but I hey he has improved so much so I'll give him that. ALSO HE LOOKS CUTE IN BRACES STFU!! \ud83e\udd2f 7. Hwang Hyunjin  \ud83e\udd99A certified drama-llama and the skilled dancer of the group that certainly deserves to be center despite the group having no center position. I have more saved pics of this guy than my bias lmao, his rapping has a good flow and has a spectacular dancing style but I feel more connected to the others. IDK there's that I guess. 6. Christopher Bang (Bang Chan/CB97)  \ud83d\udc3a Best leader to date. Love how interactive he is on VLives & in public spaces, astounding producer and songwriter; he is also handsome yet cute as well at the same time although his vocals & rapping can be bit of a hit or miss for me but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate his hard work/efforts. He really does care more for his members than himself and I wish he could rest a bit since his fatigue can be a problem for him during performances or recordings. 5. Seo Changbin (SPEARB)  \ud83d\udc30 He may be low on this list but man\u2014this guy is one hell of a bias wrecker I swear. The moment he raps, I forget who tf my bias is. He also looks very comfortable doing aegyo considering he does it all the time when no one asked to along with Felix sometimes. He seems chill & relaxed, definitely an idol I can vibe with since he doesn't overreacts plus he has a lot of patience for his members. A monster member of the group, change my mind. CHILL BUT ENTERTAINING.\u270c\ufe0f 4. Kim Seungmin  \ud83d\udc36 While I'm aware that the other members ranked lower on this list have released more content or have more fun moments than him, I just really love the fact he is cute & handsome at the same time. His vocals are my favorite in the group and he could also be a sub-rapper, YES; I really love his sarcastic and \u2018idc/idgf\u2019 nature towards the members, I would save more pics of him except if his HD pictures actually flood my timeline than Hyunjin & Chan (l don't mind tho). He could really be my bias if I can see more moments of him than the others <3 3. Lee Minho (Lee Know)  \ud83d\udc31 He is no longer my bias as you may know due to the fact someone else WRECKED me. I love his weird behavior & dancing skills like we need more of that hun, he really caught my attention since I find his personality really appealing and entertaining. While I do love his dancing and actions, I'm not really a fan of his singing. I have developed more interest now at my bias but I still love him though, he still has the best technique in dancing in the group. NEW YORK SHITTY YEAH\u2014!! \ud83d\ude4c 2. Han Jisung (J.ONE)  \ud83d\udc39 This pesky rodent is such a well-rounded idol in the industry right now istg. I love his chaotic & funny behavior like I love him for his humor and all. His singing is also really good but I prefer his melodic & lyrical rapping more. He also always flood my timeline so I notice him more, he's such a frickin meme especially when he acts bored in most interviews. He really is an entertaining member of the group and never fails to make me laugh. He also always look good in every picture so I have no choice but to save it and fill my storage, he is a definite meme material that comes in with hidden talents y'all. 1. Felix Lee  \ud83d\udc28 So where do we begin people?? I just recently changed my bias because of this boi, Felix is a massive ball of sunshine and no one can tell me otherwise. I really like his behavior & rapping although his raps aren't the best but it does add depth to their songs. His dancing is very viral-dance inspired (lmao) his behavior is also really relatable and is most definitely meme material as well like Han. He's a funny member and he also always looks honest with his feelings, his smile really could end World War 3 if it happens; I also love his pictures or posts since it not always filtered or just a selfie, he always show what's he's doing. His dancing seems very relaxed and flawless which is really my taste, also he does the bare minimum effortlessly and the next thing you know he's a trending meme format in the fandom. He does stuff I find cringy ASF but it's not cringy when he does it, so biased lmao\u2014\ud83d\udc96 \u00bb I still love all of them by the end of the day and also it's really hard to stay with a permanent bias in the group, I know no one asked but here's how my bias cycle went: \u2022 Hyunjin \u00bb Chan \u00bb Jisung \u00bb Minho \u00bb Felix\u2728 ",
