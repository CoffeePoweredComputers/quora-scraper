            "answer_text": "I use to sell beats and stopped selling them since 2008 and here is why. Most beats for Non-Exclusive license right now are going for $25 to $35 a pop esp beat stars. From my perspective, selling beats has very little value by todays standards as most Artist's want to pay the least amount of money as hardly anyone is willing to pay $100 for a beat. Sure $25 on a Non-Exclusive license can add up, but it takes a lot hard work and devoting your time, marketing and branding yourself when you can be spending more time as a creater making music. Some people have made a decent amount of money selling beats online but the vast majority are barely scratching the surface a few hundred bucks here and there. When I was selling beats at the time, I felt there was very little value in my work as I needed to advance myself to the next level. I encountered my very first Artist in 08, that sort of opened up the door to me to production. He's a very experienced Artist that's been in the music industry as he previous worked with Sean P-Diddy Combs back in the early 2000s. At the time, I didn't know what it ment to be a Producer. My first Artist taught me the ropes of recording and Vocal Production as he taught me how to structure songs, stack vocals. We produced and recorded our first song togther in the studio, and from that point I quickly transitioned from a Beat Maker to an acutal real Record Producer. We kept working together over the year's and I continued to work with more local Artists in person in the studio that help refind my sound. I'm alot more involved in the production process as I help the Vocalist get the best vocal peformance during the recording sessions which is very important as a Producer to help realize the Artist's vision. I charge a fee per Masters as my Producer Agreement is structured that the Artist pays me 50% of my Production fee at the beginning of the Recording Sessions and the other half upon completion of the Masters the finished record with vocals, mixed and master. For local Artists, I work with a budget as studio projects can range from $100-$1,000. Most Audio Engineer\u2019s charge around $35-$40 hour per recording session. I'm also make money from back end royalties from both Publishing and points on the album. Right now, I'm getting into the Sync licensing business for Film, T.V. Commerical for placing songs which is a lucrative avenue. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a tough call. Typically, my friend would charge a couple hundred dollars for it, extra for a mastering session with all of the vocals or other instrumentation added and compressed, and also make a contract with everyone involved in the making of the song signing that contains a clause of making a percentage off of every purchase of the song or radio play. Pretty much when the artist gets money from it you should as well get part of it. So determine with everyone else involved how much the song is reliant upon the beat (usually a good deal, ~25 to 33%) and then draft a contract and sign that shit. Make copies and send them to family members for safe keeping. ",
