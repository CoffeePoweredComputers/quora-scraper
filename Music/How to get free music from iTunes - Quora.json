            "answer_text": "iTunes does offer a free Single of the Week to showcase a new artist. If you open up the store and look below \"New Music\" and above the \"Movies\" you should see it. That's the only way you'll get iTunes music without paying.  If you want songs for free, there are legal sites like NoiseTrade and Bandcamp that smaller artists use to distribute their work. If you want to get songs that are on iTunes without paying for them and you can't get them from a friend, there isn't a legal way to do that. I don't like pirating music, so I'll let other answers talk about that. ",

            "answer_text": "Legal Answer: Buy iTunes Match service at $24.99/year. After that, iTunes will sync your entire music library with iCloud. So if any of your tracks gets deleted, iTunes will download that track from iCloud. Best part? No matter how shitty the quality of your original track was, it will download in iTunes Plus 256 kbps quality which is also DRM free. Not so legal answer: There are a lot of websites that offer genuine purchased iTunes Plus tracks as free download, but the only catch is that you have see a few 5 second ads to get the downloaded link.

            "answer_text": "Why don\u2019t you want to pay the artists for their work? It usually takes me at least 6 months of hard work to get a song ready to be distributed. Of the 99 cents you pay for the song, I get 2 cents. So what you are saying is that 6 months of my diligent, hard work is not worth 99 cents to you? And you want to cheat me (and other artists) out of 2 cents? That is a low blow. I hope you get a huge fine for pirating music. ",
