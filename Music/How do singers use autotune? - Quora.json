            "answer_text": "Depending on the style it can be used as an artistic effect, or as an aid to sound more in tune. If you are trying to sound more in tune(e.g. most singers), you set the autotune to the same key and scale you\u2019re singing in. The key and scale you\u2019re singing in should also be the same key and scale as the instrumental. After setting that up, they raise or lower the retune speed to make the autotune do more or less work. The more work the autotune is doing, the more robotic it sounds. Contrary to popular belief, autotune does NOT make a bad singer sound good, in fact it can make them sound even worse! After setting the autotune, mix engineers often manually fix specific parts that sound weird. Since it\u2019s automatic it will not be perfect every time which is why this is often needed. Artists like T-Pain and Travis Scott use autotune differently than a normal singer would, they in fact sing off key on purpose on specific parts(not the whole song!) to trigger the robotic sound to add flavor. Sometimes they\u2019ll sing only slightly off key if they want to keep a relatively natural voice with some slight autotune. ",
