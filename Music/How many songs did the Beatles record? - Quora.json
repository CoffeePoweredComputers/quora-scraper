            "answer_text": "This is a chronological list of songs The Beatles have released officially, starting with The Quarrymen. Found on The Beatles Anthologies. Sound effects, Snippets, Reprises etc. I will not include, just the songs. That\u2019ll Be The Day; In Spite Of All The Danger; Hallelujah, I Love Her So; You\u2019ll Be Mine; Cayenne: 5 songs With Tony Sheridan, 8 songs recorded all in all, with only 2 solely by The Beatles. Ain\u2019t She Sweet; Cry For A Shadow: 2 songs ~ +5 = 7 15 songs were recorded at the Decca studios of which only 5 were released on the Anthologies: 5 + 7 = 12 Now The Beatles at EMI Studios. Their first two singles appeared on their first LP Please Please Me. With the inclusion of \u2018How Do You Do It\u2019 on the Anthologies, would add up to 15. The One After 909 was recorded around this time, but I will include that later on the Let It Be album. 12 + 15 = 27 From Me To You single, 2 songs, and With The Beatles LP, 14 songs, She Loves You single, 2 songs, I Want To Hold You Hand single and 2 previous songs sung in German, (not counted) makes 20: 27 + 20 = 47 A Hard Day\u2019s Night LP had 13 songs. With \u2018You Know What To Do\u2019; \u2018If You\u2019ve Got Trouble\u2019; \u2018That Means A Lot\u2019; on Anthology 1 makes 16. Beatles For Sale had 14, with Leave My Kitten Alone on Anthology 1 making 15: 47 + 16 + 15 = 78 Long Tall Sally EP had 4 songs not put on any LP. Help! LP had again 14 songs. \u2018Bad Boy\u2019 was recorded too ending on Oldies But Goldies. 78 + 19 = 97 The single \u2018Day Tripper\u2019 2 songs; Rubber Soul LP 14 songs, makes 16. \u201812-Bar Original\u2019 wasn\u2019t a song, more like sound effects. Together with Revolver and the Paperback Writer single, and 16 songs: 97 + 32 = 129 The first phase of The Beatles over, we move onto the 2nd phase, starting with the Sgt Pepper LP and Penny Lane single. Penny Lane single, 2 songs; Sgt Pepper LP 12 songs. Sgt. Pepper reprise and the ending snippets not included. 14 songs. I will include George Harrison\u2019s songs later on Yellow Submarine LP. 129 + 14 = 143 All You Need Is Love single, 2 songs; Magical Mystery Tour EP, 6 songs, \u2018Jessie\u2019s Dream\u2019 and \u2018Shirley\u2019s Wild Harmonica\u2019 are not The Beatles, even though they wrote them. 8 songs: 143 + 8 = 151 Lady Madonna single, 2 songs; Hey Jude single, 2 songs; \u2018Christmastime Is Here Again\u2019 (on flexi disc), released on the Anthologies: 151 + 5 = 156 The White Double has 31 numbers all in all. \u2018Revolution 1\u2019 is a different mix to the B side of Hey Jude. \u2018Revolution 9\u2019 is just sound effects, and \u2018Take Me Back\u2019 is just a snippet. So I will cut down to just 28: 156 + 28 = 184 There are a small number of Esher Demos which have been included on two or three albums in the 1990\u2019s till the present day. These will include \u2018Sour Milk Sea\u2019; \u2018Junk\u2019; \u2018Child Of Nature\u2019; \u2018Circles\u2019; \u2018Not Guilty\u2019; \u2018What\u2019s The New Mary Jane\u2019; \u2018Los Paranoias\u2019; \u2018Teddy Boy\u2019; \u2018Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Medley\u2019; \u2018Mailman Bring Me No More Blues\u2019; \u2018Come And Get It\u2019 \u2018Goodbye\u2019. I will include 12 of these: 184 + 12 = 196 Yellow Submarine LP includes, \u2018Hey Bulldog\u2019; \u2018All Together Now\u2019; \u2018Only A Northern Song\u2019; \u2018It\u2019s All Too Much\u2019. 4 Songs. Let It Be LP has 11 songs on it with the inclusion of the \u2018Fly On The Wall\u2019 snippet single. I will just include the 11 songs: 196 + 15 = 211 And finally \u2018Abbey Road\u2019 with 17 songs: 211 + 17 = 228 So there you have it - 228 songs. Then there are the two double albums of the BBC recordings and the Love album. Choose what you want from there. P.S. I almost forgot to mention the Ballad Of John & Yoko single, 2 songs, and The Anthologies 2 new Lennon songs that made 2 seperate singles. That is four more added to my editing. Making it 232. If you see more that I forgot, let me know ",
