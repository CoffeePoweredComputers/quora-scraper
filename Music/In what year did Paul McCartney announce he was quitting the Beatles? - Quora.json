            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t really Paul.. From the stuff I\u2019ve read throughout the years John Lennon sort of sealed the deal. Yeah, they\u2019ve always made threats about it but never really went through with it but John Lennon made that official in 1969 then in \u201870 McCartney left but I know and read the band was having problems since the early 60s. The White Album, was the last album they did together. I know things got shaky after their manager, Brian Epstein, died from an OD. I know that Lennon was bad with heroin which caused tension and Yoko was an added problem but she wasn\u2019t the reason they broke up, as some might say. She wasn\u2019t liked though. McCartney, Lennon, and Harrison, were all writing music and very good at that, so they went other ways creatively. I know they released, Let it Be, after they broke up but that was only released later but made before the white album, I believe.. They had problems with dividing the Beatles, so lawsuit tension was a factor of them not performing together until \u201882 I believe, but Lennon was already dead. However, I know they used samples or his voice or something from his unreleased music(don\u2019t quote me there not sure if it was from an unreleased song and/or album, or if it was a released album and song wasn\u2019t used.) when he died.

            "answer_text": "As has already been pointed out, Paul McCartney announced he was leaving the Beatles in April 1970. However, he did not rule out working with them again in the future. But in July of that same year, he wrote a letter to Melody Maker in which he definitively stated the Beatles were finished (I believe there were further disagreements he had with the other three subsequent to his April 1970 announcement). In late December of 1970, he filed a lawsuit to dissolve the Beatles as a legal entity. ",
