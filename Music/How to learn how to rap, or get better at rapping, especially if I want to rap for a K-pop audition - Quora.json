            "answer_text": "I would definitely study into it if you\u2019re a girl, you\u2019ll notice k-pop rap style is a lot more unique in comparison to Western rap when it comes to girls rather than boys. The pronounciation is done in a particular way to give off \u2018swag\u2019 in the Korean language. Like most of K-pop, the rap focuses on perfection. What I mean is is that if you listen, you\u2019ll notice their diction and pronounciation of each individual syllable is always distinguishable. I\u2019d study the rap styles of YG artists, BTS, ATEEZ, G-IDLE and similar groups that hold strong raplines. You\u2019ll start to see similarities but more so between the girls than the boys. I know some rappers tend to pronounce some syllables with a Western-American pronounciation as K-pop is influenced by this style. For example, the syllable \uc694 (pronounced like \u2018yoh\u2019) would be said more like an American accented, \u2018Yoe\u2019 To really understand it, I\u2019d go back to it\u2019s roots. Try looking into groups like Seo Taiji and Boys, 2NE1 and Epik High. Finally, study how the girls or boys are taught on survival shows, you\u2019ll see they give some good constructive criticism on shows like Produce 101 which could come in handy. ",

            "answer_text": "Like any other skill, you need to practice. A lot. Rapping is a skill that requires a great \u201cin-built\u201d rythm, so first you have to work on that. Then, take any song you like, find a lyric video and put it on the lowest speed play possible. Rap over it until you get the hang of it, then slowly increase the speed until you can do it on the regular speed.When you\u2019ve mastered that, do it without the song, record yourself and see your mistakes so you can learn from them and improve your rapping. And then, take an instrumental (just instrumental) and rap over it, to see your rythm, your intonation, and other small aspects. Fighting. ",
