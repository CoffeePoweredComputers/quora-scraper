            "answer_text": "First of all the system of functional harmony was fully developed during the Baroque. Before 1600 composers were still writing polyphonic music in the church modes (Dorian, Phrygian etc.). After 1600 monophonic music and the major-minor tonal system became more dominant. Rameau wrote his Treatise on Harmony in 1722. The chords of a pop song today are still indebted to the harmonic developments of that era. Classical composers of the twentieth century were often influenced by Bach. Heitor Villa-Lobos combined Brazilian folk music with Baroque in his Bachianas Brasileiras. Dmitri Shostakovich wrote fugues in a neoclassical style. Sometimes songwriters can choose to use instruments or progressions that were typical of the Baroque. In the late 1960s there was a genre Baroque pop. George Harrison\u2019s piano solo in In My Life (1965) was played at double speed to sound a bit like a harpsichord. An actual harpsichord was used in Donovan\u2019s Sunshine Superman (1966) and Van Morrison\u2019s Cyprus Avenue (1968). The introduction to Procol Harum\u2019s A Whiter Shade of Pale, played on a Hammond organ, is reminiscent of Bach\u2019s Air on the G -String. A more recent example is the album Foreverland (2016) by The Divine Comedy. The song Catherine the Great evokes the 18th century with harpsichord and brass instruments. So the influence of Baroque on today\u2019s music is bigger than you might expect.  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a musicologist so I\u2019m not going to embarrass myself by trying to give you a technical answer, but I hear baroque music in modern popular music a lot. Firstly roughly one in ten pop songs is just Pachelbel\u2019s Canon in D. Including the Village People \u2013 Go West, and the Pet Shop Boys cover of it and the football chant adaptations of that prevalent throughout English football stadiums (\u201cone nil to the ing-er-land\u201d)\u2026 when people turn your music into football chants, the influence can\u2019t go much further. I\u2019ll hand the floor to Rob Paravonian here:  I also can\u2019t listen to this or the Stevie Wonder song it sampled without hearing Bach\u2019s prelude in C minor from WTC book 1:  And of course there are parts of the legacy which are less cryptic. Henry Purcell\u2019s march for the funeral of Queen Mary II was revived in the Clockwork Orange soundtrack by Wendy Carlos, which deadmau5 paid tribute to with this:  I\u2019m sure there are countless more examples, but those are the ones that always come to mind first.
