            "answer_text": "One Piece refers to one of the central plot elements and also one of the central mysteries of the series. The Great Treasure of One Piece is the legendary treasure owned by the King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger, better known as Gold Roger. It is said to be of unimaginable value. \u201cMy Treasure? Why it\u2019s right where I left it. It\u2019s yours if you can find it. But you will have to search the whole world!\u201d Those were Roger\u2019s final words before he was publicly executed in Loguetown. What was meant to serve as an example to prevent others from becoming Pirates, instead sparked what became known as the Great Pirate Era. Roger\u2019s last words inspired many to travel to the Grand Line in pursuit of dreams greater than they ever dared to imagine. 20 years later, Monkey D. Luffy, inspired by his idol, Red Haired Shanks seeks to find the One Piece and become the next King of the Pirates. He has recruited many individuals throughout his journey, and has faced many challenges along the way. To this day, he remains determined, to find the Great Treasure and become the Pirate King. There are many theories going around as to what One Piece is, however only Eiichiro Oda, the author of the series knows what it is. After years of speculation that the treasure was the journey itself, Oda has confirmed that the treasure is a physical reward. Hope this explains why the title of the show is One Piece. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the final objective for the pirates in the OP universe is the greatest treasure, One Piece Previous Pirate King, Gol. D Roger said he left all of his treasure there (many pirates thinks it should be Raftel). That last words of his before death sentence execution have sparked a new Great Pirate Age That treasure is known as One Piece. One have to reach Raftel, the last destination in the entire Grand Line, to be qualified as Pirate King. (your power and politics matters too) The reason why Gol. D Roger refuses to take the treasure is because of his health. Maybe the treasure is not great wealth. Maybe the treasure grants wielder absolute power to rule the world. Unite all the kingdoms and nations together as ONE. It could be combining all the nations into a large piece of land. But the politics between all the nations is chaotic, so there is no point in that. Judging the creater of the Manga said there will be a greater war, many magnitude bigger than that in Marinefold. Makes me think that One Piece is definitely not money, it is power to unite the world Well that\u2019s my take on the Theory TLDROne Piece is a \u2018treasure\u2019 for pirates to find ",
