            "answer_text": "In addition to her decision to define her singer persona as old soul, she looks old because of her stylist who wears her like someone over 30.  And as her songs carry the same old soul vibe, it matches perfectly with the songs like When We Were Young\u2026 And I think it\u2019s weird too that someone in her late 20s wrote a song with that title.   I like her clothes and find them fancy however her on-stage style makes her look much older in the eyes of normal people. Lastly, in her normal life, she doesn\u2019t dress up like that.    ",
