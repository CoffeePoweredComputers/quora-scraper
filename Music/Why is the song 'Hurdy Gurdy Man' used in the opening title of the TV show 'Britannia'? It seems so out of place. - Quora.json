            "answer_text": "It\u2019s perfect for the show on so many levels. Creepy,cool and Celtic. And aren\u2019t the Druids like hippies? The song is not as hippy-dippy happy as it seems in the first lyrics. Rather, the theme of the song fits with the Roman conquest and accompanying brutality. Note the second lyric: \u201cHistories of ages past unenlightened shadows cast/Down through all eternity the crying of humanity.\u201d Humans keep repeating warlike behaviors throughout history. We never really evolve. ",

            "answer_text": "I thought that at first, but then its hardly a documentary is it? It\u2019s camp, modern style seems to fit quite well with Donovan\u2019s old hippy time song which he apparently bought off the writers for the cost of a flight to London. Britannia is NOT Game of Thrones, once you accept that it\u2019s quiet good fun. Daft but fun. Could have done with Neil Marshall directing though. Julian Rhind-Tutt actually looks and sounds like Kings Road 1968 so Donovan sounds pretty apt. ",
