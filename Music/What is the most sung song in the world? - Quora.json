            "answer_text": "If all the translations of Happy Birthday into other languages are considered, I'd go with that as well (generally sung to the exact same tune). However, if we are saying it is a different song if the lyrics are in another language, then I'd guess the Chinese national anthem. With over 1.3 billion in population, and with the song being sung at every national holiday and all sporting events, I think there's a decent chance it eclipses any song sung in the English language.
