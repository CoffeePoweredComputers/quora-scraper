            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you. It sounds miserable. People always tell you that you need \u201cbalance\u201d, but what does that mean? A lot of people think of studying as whipping the mush dogs inside. \u201cGo, go! Keep going!\u201d Well, you\u2019re just leading those sled dogs to burnout. And also misery \u2014 physically and emotionally. Emotionally you suffer because maybe you don\u2019t whip the dogs hard enough and you don\u2019t make it as far. Did you just not whip them hard enough? What a terrible way to treat the dogs who depend so much on you! Plus, puppies. :( Who could whip puppies? What you don\u2019t realize is that you\u2019re actually hurting yourself that way. You wouldn\u2019t hit puppies, why would you hit yourself with that berating behavior? This is only compounded by the fact that science classes \u2014 especially foundational ones, trust me here from my own experience \u2014 aren\u2019t meant to give you all of the knowledge at once. It\u2019s like you\u2019re getting some of the information each time a little by little with each pass. You\u2019ll only get sad with this way of thinking in virtue of how the classes are instructing you. Additionally, your body is going to take a toll. Take it from me \u2014 I study 5\u20136 hours a day every day a week. Your shoulders hurt and your neck starts to kill you. Get ready for some Thermacare heat wrap usage; I should buy stock in it\u2026 So how do I get through it all? I try to be mindful. That means for me knowing when I\u2019m being way too hard on myself and hurting puppies so to speak. I set some time out for mediation.I exercise and I do yoga. I listen to podcasts and try to learn from peaceful and balanced people (DharmaSeed is my favorite).Why not start with some healthy habits that you don\u2019t know you don\u2019t like? Start doing beginner meditation every day. That\u2019s a good first start. It\u2019s going to help prepare you for the rigors of studying. I think it\u2019d be silly and detrimental to go from 0 to 60 on this with your study habits. You\u2019ll get frustrated with all of the self-flagellation and it\u2019ll pan out to nothing. Work in increments and start the little things before the big things are introduced. Just try to establish an exercise or mediation habit for a week. Wake up 30 minutes earlier each day. Give yourself little victories along the way, and then introduce yourself to bigger and bigger challenges. As for study skills, Cornell note-taking method is a popular one. I myself use the Pomodoro timer and study in 20 minutes increments with 5 minute breaks. That won\u2019t be the hard part, though, consistency will be the hard part. Start practicing consistency, and you\u2019ll be well on your way! ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know the situation, but don't. That is the fast track to burning out and getting sick of school, learning, and yourself, especially if you jump into a rigorous study schedule you aren't accustomed to. Do not simplify yourself and pretend that is all you are worth. Studying is important, and I would recommend you make a schedule forcing you to study a few hours a day; however, you shouldn't forget you have a life outside of school. If you want to improve your grades talk to your teachers and find out what skills you're lacking, then turn in all your work. If you really need it, get a tutor. More outside that seems excessive, but again, I don't know the situation. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I dont do god in my life, but if it suits you, perhaps the monastic life might be an option. One of the best things that some religions offer is the ability for people to dedicate themselves to nothing but learning. Sometimes monasteries are one of the few places that see \u201clearning for the sake of learning\u201d as a decent way to pull your weight within the community. It\u2019s a pity the rest of the world doesn't see it the same way. Even monks need IT and someone who can advise on physics these days. Just a thought. ",
