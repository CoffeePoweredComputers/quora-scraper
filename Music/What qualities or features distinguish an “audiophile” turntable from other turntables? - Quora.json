            "answer_text": "An Audiophile turntable is basically designed to optimize sound quality and is usually a Zero compromises type of product.  These turntables are generally quite a few steps above in quality and price of the mass-produced, usually plastic-bodied turntables.  Audiophile turntables are designed to operate as precisely and as smoothly as possible. Their platter and motor will spin with minimal to no variation in speed, possible vibrations and resonance. reducing wow and flutter. The motor will be very stable and have high torque output. The platter tends to have more mass than the Hi Fi turntable. Turntable engineers tend to use heavy materials and design heavy platters. Not only are they less prone to being disturbed by vibrations, but they also have inertia on their side.  Even the New Technics SL-1000RE-S Reference Turntable System weighs in at over 40kg, does not use plastics and, its platter weighs about 8 kilos and has a triple-layered construction of brass, die-cast aluminium and rubber (for damping purposes). Technics also claims an astonishingly low wow & flutter figure of 0.015%. This is their 50th anniversary turntable and is designed to \u201ccompete\u201d in the big leagues. And to control the speed of the motor the engineers have opted for an external power supply, which uses a switching circuit with noise filtering and a precision digital servo system with an optical sensor to detect speed variations. This outboard power supply offers 33.3, 45 and 78rpm speeds and allows subtle adjustments down to 0.01 of a revolution per minute. I mentioned this turntable because it is a good example of the length the engineers from Technics went in order to turn their usually more \u201ccommon\u201d turntables into an exquisite \u201cAudiophile Grade\u201d machine.  And several other manufacturers also have their \u201cAudiophile Grade\u201d turntables. Another good example would be the Thorens reference turntable.  In Audiophile Turntables the tonearm is also usually switchable and will operate with the lowest amount of friction possible. The turntable plinth will have vibration absorbers or better built-in mechanisms used to dampen and absorb unwanted vibrations either from the motor or from possible nearby interference coming from other parts of the sound system and/or any other possible source for the mentioned vibrations.  They may also provide the possibility to add other arms so you can use or test different cartridges and different arms.  Audiophile Turntables go the extra length to provide the most stable environment so the needle is able to pick up the vibration from the grooves in the record most accurately with the least possible outside interference. It is obvious that after that, the sky is the limit and some brands may go a bit \u201cover the top\u201d  But the aim is always the same. To provide the most stable machine money can buy  For example, the Air Force Zero is the largest, heaviest and most expensive turntable by TechDAS. It has a total weight in excess of 500 kg because it incorporates a primary chassis, a platter base, and five-platter assembly with a combined mass of 118 kg with three of the platters are made of stainless steel, and the third and fifth are made of cast gunmetal and power-sintered tungsten respectively. The TechDAS Air Force Zero costs around US$350 000, excluding tonearm and cartridge and is one of the world\u2019s most exclusive turntables.  Bottom line. Audiophile turntables are usually in a very different league from the more conventional Hi Fi turntable. This does not mean you can not have a very good performance with a more \u201cmodest\u201d Hi FI turntable.  There are plenty of good options on the market such as the Rega on the image above. You are just trying to compare two products that really usually have no possible comparison.

            "answer_text": "There is no specific definition\u2026 However, in general, an \u201caudiophile product\u201d is one that provides good performance - especially in that it sounds good. In the case of a turntable, a good quality turntable should NOT introduce any sound of its own into the playback process. You should NOT hear speed variations, or noises leaking through from the motor into the audio signal, or distortion at certain spots on the record because the cartridge is being held at slightly the wrong angle, or anything like that. You also should not find that your records wear out because the stylus pressure is too high or the stylus is being held at the wrong angle. While many of these things are the result of how well you adjust your turntable, a good quality turntable will make adjusting them properly simpler, and remain adjusted correctly once set up right. With a poor quality turntable, you may find yourself unable to adjust it to perform well, it may drift out of adjustment over time, it may introduce speed variations or funny noises while you play albums, or it may wear out or otherwise damage the records you play on it.
