            "answer_text": "It is possible (though unlikely, given the lack of live phone calls on music radio stations today) that you are hearing the radio station\u2019s profanity delay \u201cramping-up.\u201d With the exception of very old units, radio station profanity delays have a feature designed to make them almost undetectable to listeners. The feature works as follows\u2014when the delay is started up or comes out of being \u201cdumped,\u201d the audio that comes out of the delay is subtly \u201cstretched out\u201d in time. The listener, at first, hears audio that is live, but gradually, a time lag develops between what comes out of the station\u2019s studio console and the instant at which listeners hear that audio. Eventually, the audio coming out of the console does not reach listeners until 7\u201310 seconds later. ",
