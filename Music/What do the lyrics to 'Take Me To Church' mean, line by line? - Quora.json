            "answer_text": "\u201cMy lover's got humor His girl is kind of an asshole and has a dark twisted sense of humor She's the giggle at a funeral She\u2019s inappropriate Knows everybody's disapproval And gives no fucks what people think of her I should've worshipped her sooner It took him awhile to get used to her and realize how great she is If the Heavens ever did speak So great, that if the angels and God were to comment on her, they\u2019d say She is the last true mouthpiece\u201d She keeps it real and has no filter. She\u2019s probably considered trashy by his stuck up religious family or peers. Every Sunday's getting more bleak As time progresses and he learns more about his religion and the agenda they push he sees it differently and realizes A fresh poison each week It\u2019s not good, but poisonous and hateful 'We were born sick, ' you heard them say it TheY teach we are destined to fail and have some mysterious entity supposedly controlling everything. There\u2019s no way to change your destiny My church offers no absolutes hes realized this through her rebellious spirit and brutal honesty, so he\u2019s become his obsession and his truth. She is the answer to why he is here She tells me 'worship in the bedroom' She doesn\u2019t believe in worshipping something you can\u2019t see or interact with but he can shower love and attention in her bedroom The only heaven I'll be sent to She thinks heaven is bs Is when I'm alone with you And our time we live now, is our one chance to find our own heaven. For her, heaven is being with him . I was born sick, but I love it She embraces her deviant dirty instincts Command me to be well She wants to be dominated Amen. Amen. Amen here he\u2019s agreeing very much Take me to church Take me to bed I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I\u2019ll do whatever you want and don\u2019t care if it\u2019s true. I\u2019m yours completely I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife I will open up and be vulnerable. I\u2019ll tell you things about me that you can use against me later Offer me that deathless death So when you break me down and I hate you or just don\u2019t care enough about you and die inside, although my body lives on Good God, let me give you my life I\u2019ll do anything for you. You may have my soul if it were a thing I could give If I'm a pagan of the good times I\u2019ll hang on to our happiness as long as I can My lover's the sunlight She is the only thing that can light his world or send him into darkness To keep the Goddess on my side he\u2019ll work to get her whatever she wants She demands a sacrifice He will sacrifice his time, body, health etc to earn enough To drain the whole sea To get her material possessions that she wants Get something shiny Big ring, jewels, nice car, big house, spoil her Something meaty for the main course Some people might have to suffer for her to get all these things That's a fine looking high horse And he can see where people may try to speak poorly of his means to an end What you got in the stable? But everyone has skeletons We've a lot of starving faithful When you buy things from 3rd world countries with low pay and no worker rights, you are just as guilty of greed and selfishness That looks tasty Cuz you want it That looks plenty Lots of everything. More more more This is hungry work When you start being greedy, you\u2019re never satisfied. You\u2019re always hungry\u2026. So he is telling the story of where this is going and where it ultimately ends up. At the end of the day, we are all greedy bastards ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cMy lover's got humour She's the giggle at a funeral Knows everybody's disapproval I should've worshipped her sooner If the Heavens ever did speak She is the last true mouthpiece\u201d The author is beginning to describe his lover and set her up as a pagan god who is authentically divine and worthy of praise. Every Sunday's getting more bleak A fresh poison each week 'We were born sick, ' you heard them say it The author is criticizing Christianity, characterizing the message of original sin as fresh poison distributed each Sunday. My church offers no absolutes His new religion, the worship of his lover, is flexible and not restrictive like Christianity. She tells me 'worship in the bedroom' The only heaven I'll be sent to Is when I'm alone with you She prescribes worship and it is sex. He describes this worship as the true heaven. I was born sick, but I love it Command me to be well Amen. Amen. Amen Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife Offer me that deathless death Good God, let me give you my life The chorus is a scathing critique of Christianity, where the parishioner is said to assume the role of a lowly dog worshiping a false religion. Confessing sin is seen as an opportunity for the clergy to take advantage of the parishioner. The last two lines are sarcastic. If I'm a pagan of the good times My lover's the sunlight To keep the Goddess on my side She demands a sacrifice To drain the whole sea Get something shiny Something meaty for the main course That's a fine looking high horse What you got in the stable? We've a lot of starving faithful That looks tasty That looks plenty This is hungry work This part is a bit more difficult. I think the author is describing his lover as demanding lots of sex in order to be satisfied with his \u201cworship.\u201d He juxtaposes this sexually fulfilling relationship with sex starved faithful Christians, who might look at his relationship with some envy. Anyway, that's my best go at it. Let me know what you think. Also just to clarify, I'm a Christian myself so I'm not personally on board with the message of the song. ",

            "answer_text": "Genius.com has an entry for Take Me to Church, with some info and quotes from Hozier himself. Overall, Hozier said this about the song: \u201cIt\u2019s about sex and it\u2019s about humanity, and obviously sex and humanity are incredibly tied. Sexuality, and sexual orientation \u2014 regardless of orientation \u2014 is just natural\u2026 The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love.\u201d The line-by-line notes are available if you follow the link above. If there\u2019s a specific line you wanted to know about I can copy it here, but it wouldn\u2019t help you much to copy the entire song since it\u2019s easier to reference on Genius. ",

            "answer_text": "You really need to understand pagan religion and the process of sacrifice aswell as popular pre Christian attitudes towards sex and death. There is no point interpreting this songs without that knowledge. The lover mentioned is a goddess. Possibly Ishtar, and she literally demands an animal sacrifice. The Christian concept of \u2018Sin\u2019 is ciriticized in the song. And the Christian concept of the divide between the secular and the sacred is heavily scrutinized. ",
