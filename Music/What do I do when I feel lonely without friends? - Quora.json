            "answer_text": "Did you ever read or hear of, \u201cHow To Be Your Own Best Friend\u201d? That\u2019s a start. The problem is that you may end up being your only friend. Ask yourself, why are you friendless? Could it be that you prefer your own solitude to the company of others? If so, congratulations. That\u2019s a decision you\u2019re entitled to make. But if you\u2019re truly lonely for others\u2019 companionship, you must go where people are. They used to say that churches were the last refuge of the friendless. Now that\u2019s the \u201ctwelve step\u201d programs. Is there a library reading group near you? A civic group that could use your voice? Is there an animal shelter that could use a hand? Can you volunteer in any way? Not knowing you or where you live I\u2019m ill-equipped to recommend. But I do know one thing: You must get out of your house. Start with phone calls & Internet contacts to establish aquaintances with mutual interests. They will connect you with activities needing your help where you will meet others, potential friends. An old man of my acquaintance used to say, \u201cIf you want to catch fish, you have to hang your hat with fishermen.\u201d Now I do not advocate fishing. But the meaning is clear. I would commend to you Proverbs 18: 24: \u201cA man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.\u201d Good luck & best wishes in your search. Peace, Comfort, & Joy, SAS ",
