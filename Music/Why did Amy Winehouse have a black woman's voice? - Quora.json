            "answer_text": "First of all, there is no objective \u201cblack woman voice\u201d, there\u2019s just a stereotype of it to which we\u2019ve grown accustomed to, modeled after several singers and the musical genres they fell into. She didn\u2019t, as far as I can tell. She had \u201cblack\u201d phrasing and singing style, but in a blind test, I doubt you\u2019d mistake her for a black singer, like a gospel singer or something. She absorbed the phrasing and style of the music she liked and listened to, and chose her repertoire accordingly \u2014 a bit like Joss Stone. I don\u2019t think their voices are \u201cblack\u201d \u2014 in a general sense, of course \u2014 they\u2019re richer in the higher frequency range, and therefore can be more \u201craspy\u201d than your typical black singer stereotype, who to my ear features more even harmonics. Among men, Tom Jones is a similar case \u2014 in part of his range he might be mistaken for a black singer, other times he sounds different. ",
