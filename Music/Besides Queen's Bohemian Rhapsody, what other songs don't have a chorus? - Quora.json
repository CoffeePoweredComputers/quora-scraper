            "answer_text": "Bohemian Rhapsody isn\u2019t the only popular song without a chorus. It is an unusual song, because its form is unusual. The word \u201crhapsody\u201d hints at this. Instead of having two or three main tunes, it keeps unfolding into new material. There is a word for this structure in German - durchkomponiert- which is rendered in English as \u201cthrough-composed.\u201d Here are some Beatles\u2019 songs without a chorus: A Hard Day\u2019s Night And I Love Her Norwegian Wood Here, There and Everywhere When I\u2019m 64 Honey Pie Each of these songs has verses and a bridge, but no chorus (Honey Pie and Here, There and Everywhere also have introductions. ) If I Fell is also like this. Its form can be outlined thus: Introduction Verse 1 Verse 2 Bridge Verse 3 Bridge Verse 4 Coda [ending]  Tom Jobim\u2019s song, The Girl from Ipanema also has a verse verse bridge verse format:  But some songs that have this same form Tune 1 (Tune 1 again) Tune 2 Tune 1 (also known as ABA or AABA) do have a chorus. One example of this is Puttin\u2019 On the Ritz, which has a repeated chorus and a changing bridge, functioning as a verse. ",
