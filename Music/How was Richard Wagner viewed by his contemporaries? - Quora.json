            "answer_text": "Wagner has always been a composer who has drawn sharply contrasted opinions. In fact, in the 2nd half of 19th century Germany there seemed to be two camps, and you couldn't be in both: You were either for Wagner or Brahms. Wagner's devotees included Liszt and Hans Von Bulow while on the Brahms (conservative) side were musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Clara Schumann. Elsewhere, composer and critical views on Wagner can be demonstrated by what they said:Rossini's famous comment was: \"Mr Wagner has beautiful moments but bad quarters of an hour.\"Tchaikovsky was \"bored\" by Wagner's music, while the critic Eduard Hanslick said of the Tristan prelude: \"With scrupulous avoidance of all closing cadences, this boneless tonal mollusc, self-renewing, swims ever on into the immeasurable...\" That's the bad press, but it has to be said that Wagner's influence on a subsequent generation of composers was enormous...far greater than that of his critics, even Brahms, whose influence was relatively minor. Composers like Mahler gave him an elevated position in which he was accorded an almost  godlike status.  There is a story of a woman who boasted to Mahler that she had turned down Wagner's sexual advances.  Mahler flew into a rage, saying that she should have been honoured that so great a man had shown an interest in her. ",
