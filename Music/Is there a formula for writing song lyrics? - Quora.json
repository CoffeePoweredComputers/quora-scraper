            "answer_text": "No true formula, per se. But there are certain classic song forms and compositional devices that are proven to work, for powerful reasons that are grounded in human needs and human character. For example, you need to understand basic song forms and how they each work better for different types of lyric content: AAA, AABA, verse/chorus, blues. You should understand rhyme schemes, metaphor, how to write lyrics that sing well, how to set up and develop a storyline, how to leverage the power of repetition, etc. There are plenty of good available books and materials you can study.

            "answer_text": "There is no true formula. Lyrics could come from any source stretching from a single line that happens to branch out mentally into a full set of lyrics (my first composition for my current project) to putting music under a Romantic-era British sea ballad that\u2019s been forgotten by everyone but upturned-nose English scholars (The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, lyrics by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, music by Iron Maiden). In reality, you just have to try to wait for lyrics to come to you first, and eventually, your formula will follow. ",
