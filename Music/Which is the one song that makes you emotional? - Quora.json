            "answer_text": "You just said it, didn't you?The entire Rang de Basanti soundtrack, as a matter of fact. I love Roobaroo, for example. The lyrics are beautiful.Then there are songs like Dil He Chhota Saa, Maa (from TZP),  Behti Hawa Saa Thaa Woh.There are even more in English. Green Day for example, is a punk rock band, and yet Wake Me Up When September Ends is one of the most touching songs I've ever heard. Billie Joe Armstrong himself started crying while singing it once. Then there's Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd.And so many others.But hey, that's what music is supposed to do, isn't it? :) ",
