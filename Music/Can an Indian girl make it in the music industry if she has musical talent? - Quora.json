            "answer_text": "Well in short Yes! But music industry is kinda tricky. Make sure that you completely understand how the music industry works. Being a full time musician, here are few things that I'll mention : Industry produces audience compatible stuff. That simply means that it doesn't really matter if you are into pink floyd\u2026. You'll have to sing ( assuming girl's a vocalist) munni badnam hui if that's what audience is into.There are all the kind of people in industry. Extremely talented and artistic as well as simply money minded.Your priorities should be clear. Industry tries to adjust you when you try to be a part of it. Eg kapil sharma went Mumbai to be a singer and turned out to be a comedian.It can be really hard to get into industry with no established contacts.Awareness is the key.Ps I prefer being an independent musician because it helps me to be genre specific.
