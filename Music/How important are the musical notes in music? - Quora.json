            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say you are a musician in the 10th century. All the music you know is stuff that you have heard others play. If you want to learn a song, you have to find someone who knows it, listen to them (you may only get one shot at this) and memorize it. This is eactly what mistrels and minnisingers did before some monk had the idea to write a squggly line above a line of text to show how a melody went. That was the beginning of written music that centuries later became the system of staves and notes that we currently use. No composer could have written anything more complex that, say, a two-part round, let alone a symphony or opera. And there would be no other way to pass on music from one generation to anothert except by rote. In short, musical notes are just as important as words. Now, there are a lot of people who can\u2019t read or write, and there are a lot of musicians who can\u2019t read music, just as there are some cultures with no system of written music. But the body of written music exists for the benefit of anyone who wants to recreate to sound ideas of someone who wrote it down. Just as the body of literature is there for anyone who wants to share an idea. ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re as important as the script for a movie or play. In fact, that\u2019s what a musical score is: the script for a repeatable performance. Having a score isn\u2019t equally important for all types of music and performances. Folk music, for example, gets passed down by memorization, participation, and imitation from each generation to the next. Choral, ensemble, and orchestral music with many different parts that are played together is too complex for that. It needs a score to serve as an authoritative reference point for everyone, and to clearly define the work in every detail. Solo classical pieces are also too complex to learn without having something to read them from, although a lot of solo performers memorize the score in the process of learning it. Many composers and musicologists can read scores like books and hear them in their minds without a need for instruments. That\u2019s like reading a stage play silently and visualizing the performance. Improvised performances tend to have scores too, but they tend to be more sketchy, with written instructions, passages of notation, and designated places for free improv with a repeating accompaniment.
