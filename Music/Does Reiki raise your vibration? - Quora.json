            "answer_text": "As someone who learnt & used Reiki only for the purpose of self healing; for at-least 8 years before I went on to become a Reiki Master coz I was guided to help others, I would surely say it sure does raise your vibration! Absolutely! Especially with powerful Holy Fire Reiki energy. I have literally woken up from sleep in the middle of the night, with tears of an unnamed emotion (which I now realize to\u2019ve been gratitude) flowing down my cheeks & my heart expanded with a feeling of \u2018feeling so loved\u2019 that nothing else mattered. Reiki is pure light & light cannot but uplift ones vibration. That\u2019s its nature. There is no other way for it to be, since nothing lower vibrational can be part of the light:) However, that being said, how soon or how deeply or how often u feel a raised vibration & its all round effects will always depend on what u are seeking to heal or lighten & where you are in that journey. The deeper rooted the things that create darker within us, & the lesser the healing work we\u2019ve done or received, or lesser spiritually attuned we are, the more work it will be. Coz the light energy goes deeper & deeper to first clear & bring the hurts & the pains out; hitting at the core of the cause. This can often temporarily cause what\u2019s called a \u2018healing crisis\u2019 where more of what\u2019s being cleared away or worked upon will be felt; such as depression or anxiety or physically discomforting symptoms like headaches or ungroundedness etc. To be filled in with light; the unresolved hurts & traumas first have to be pushed out, through love. Unlike, what many people believe, Reiki, just like anything else is committed work, esp when one is working on healing deeply, in order to reach deeper & deeper & more & more lasting stages of an uplifted vibration of peace, harmony, & joy. Its essentially about bringing one to a state of energy & chakra balance. It\u2019s not a one session all done magic wand! However, even with all this, people often feel deep peace even in a first session. Please feel free to read more on Reiki if u like, on my blog https://antahsaara.com/41/ ",

            "answer_text": "Reiki will raise OR lower your vibration depending on what you need. Reiki helps rebalance your energies therefore it adds neutral energy to the auric layers as necessary bringing each one back into balance. Some auric layers may be moving sluggishly, therefore, the Reiki would help it become faster. But other layers may be moving too quickly, in which case the Reiki healer will attempt to use the neutral energy to slow it down. So, Reiki doesn\u2019t always raise your vibration, it steadies it and creates a balanced you. For more information, see my website Tas Readings. ",
