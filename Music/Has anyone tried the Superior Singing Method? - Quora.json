            "answer_text": "This man and his business are very shady and will extort you if you let him. I unfortunately fell prey to his scam. At least I learned a lesson. Somewhere during the purchasing of his product, he sneaks in a monthly recurring fee. I do not remember ever agreeing to a monthly recurring fee, which means he hides this in small print. This is not right. I emailed regarding the situation since he had taken out nearly $300 dollars of a service I did not knowingly agree to pay for. The lack of understanding or compassion that I received made it clear that he does this constantly. I have also seen others complain about the same thing on another review website. He hopes that you do not see the monthly charge, and he will not refund you when you have realized the mistake. This is not an honest way to do business. It\u2019s technically \u201clegal\u201d I suppose but it\u2019s absolutely immoral. The best part is that when I asked what the monthly subscription offers, he realized that I didn't have an account where I could have used the services, so he made me a new account. Even with direct proof that I have never used the services, since I never willingly would have subscribed to a recurring monthly fee, even then, he would not refund the subscription charges. I never asked for a refund on the Superior Singing Method since I knowingly and gladly (though I now regret it) paid for. I just asked for a refund on a service that must have been sneakily placed in the fine print. I accidentally subscribed to recurring service once, and the company understood the situation and refunded the mistake. Aaron does not treat his customers the same way since he seems to operate with the infamous recurring subscription fee scam. It is an honest product with a dishonest and hidden stipulation. There are other vocal coaches and vocal training programs that are just like hm. Do not give your money to someone who bases a large portion of his profits on unassuming people. It is not honest. In a world that is full of scammers and liars, give your money to people who mean well. ",

            "answer_text": "I finished the Superior Singing Method course three years ago, in early 2015, and it was really the kickstart to my singing. It did not only promise, but also delivered a tremendous improvement in my singing and made me confident, for the first time in my life, to sing in front of other people when I play music. Here's what I liked about the course: + I felt constant improvement starting from around week 2, and I just kept getting better. I am now proud to sing my favorite songs in front of people \u2013 which is something I never even dreamed about a few years ago. + It's a very high-quality course from a world-class vocal teacher with a large YouTube following. Trustworthiness you just can't get when taking lessons in the neighborhood. + It's affordable! At 99$, for the price of just two lessons with my face-to-face New Orleans vocal coach \u2013 I got 8 weeks full of daily lessons and exercises that have proven to make me improve way faster. + The structure of the course is easy to follow and will motivate you to improve and to keep going. The members area is built in a professional level as well. + You can watch the course from your tablet or mobile as well. + It's very time-efficient. You don't have to drive somewhere for a lesson. You don't have to wait for it to come in the mail since it's accessible instantly from everywhere. The lessons are short and to the point. About 15 minutes a day and you're done \u2013 and that's really all you need in order to see massive improvement as long as you're consistent. (of course that if after the warm ups you'll also sing a couple of songs so it will make it even more practical for you and you'll improve even faster. + The course comes with a large PDF e-book that summarizes all the points and tips from the course, something which I found helpful to refer back to even long after I finished the course. + They offer a bunch of follow up courses to take your singing even farther \u2013 I took the one called \u201cSuperior Harmony\u201d where I improved my ability to sing along with other people, recognize different musical intervals that sound best when singing together, etc. + There's a 60-days full money back guarantee in case you don't dig it.

            "answer_text": "I have not tried it. And the reason I did not try it is because in my first exposure to Mr. Anastasi\u2019s promo (the one where he addresses the viewer from inside the empty Greek Theatre in Los Angeles), he tells a lie in order scare the viewer and to make his course look like the solution to their fear. The lie? That the \u201csinging tips and tricks\u201d videos that other vocal instructors post on YouTube will harm your voice. This is a wholesale lie. I have experience with several individuals who post instructive vocal content on YouTube and not only do these mini lessons NOT cause harm, but the instructors usually, if not always, inform the viewer how to avoid harming their voice. There is also another point that bothers me: There is only one video online of Anastasi singing\u2014it\u2019s from 2007 and it\u2019s okay but his vocal performance\u2014not dynamic, kinda lifeless\u2014would never lead me to think \u201cHey, I should take lessons from this guy.\u201d On the other hand, the instructors who I follow online (Mark Baxter and Ken Tamplin mostly) can really sing and there\u2019s plenty of video evidence. Aaron Anastasi might be a good singer but he\u2019s a Superior Marketer. Many marketers tell casual lies. The best ones don\u2019t. ",

It's not the best course I ever tried (I also have an offline singing course), but overall I think it the most reliable online course for singing.

You can get/download all the course materials through the member area on their website.  The creator Aaron Anastasi give his customers not only a singing exercises but also give them a diet guidance, what to eat and what to avoid to make your singing level better.

It's a mix of info that would be broadly considered false in the singing community, laughably oversimplified facts, and good fundamental basics of singing. Maybe 10% is in that last category. Personally I'm against these sorts of systems, and think they're usually scams, because there isn't a lot that's proven to get you good at singing for relatively little money, other than voice lessons. You'd just get more bang for your buck from a single voice lesson than from this whole course. ",

            "answer_text": "I do appreciate the view points of David and I feel that most of what he has said is true. However, this specific course \u201cThe Superior Singing Method\u201d does not sound a bluff to me and the source of this course is quite credible enough for justifying it. Aaron Anastasi, the founder of this course, isn\u2019t a self proclaimed guru or something. He has lot\u2019s of experience in this field, has worked directly with many Gammy Award winning producers and has a lot of recognition specifically in this field. Throughout his career he has taught lessons of singing to many and people have appreciated his lessons greatly. Although I haven\u2019t tried this course myself because I am not really into this stuff. But based on the above stated fact I am convinced that this course might be worth trying. And if you are looking for any detailed perspective then I suggest you to read this article The Superior Singing Method - Best Singing Lesson Online? - Hobbiesphere. I have personally read this one thoroughly and am willing to recommend a thorough read of it to anyone who\u2019s interested in purchasing this course. ",

Yesterday my credit card company sent me a notice by email that this company was trying to charge my credit card - without my authorization! I immediately tried to go to their website where I bought the program from, thinking I can find their contact number to tell them to stoping doing so, and it turned out that their website is DEAD - everywhere you clicked, it was linked to a dead web page. So I guessed this company was out of business. But I am very disappointed about their final attempt to charge my credit card for something that they are no longer offering. ",

Well, then, it sounds like YOU\u2019ve made a bad mistake.\u201d There are a few people who are positive, but I suspect they don\u2019t know about the continuing charges or are paid to promote it.

Aaron starts from the absolute basics of breathing techniques and correct posture and gradually builds it up to advanced teachings. I have noticed quite a bit of improvement in my voice's range, agility and power. I would strongly recommend it. Good luck with your singing endeavors! ",
