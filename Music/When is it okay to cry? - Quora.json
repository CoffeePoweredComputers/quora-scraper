            "answer_text": "We cannot completely take note of ourself as to when it is okay to cry, but it is okay to cry. If you find there is a need to cry, it is okay. If you have been maintaining some views that it is not okay to cry in public, at least we can control crying. Somehow, controlling it would help us because we follow certain rules in social ethical procedures. That is the only positive reason we can conclude for not crying where people witnessed it. We wanted our crying private. We could even continue our expressive personal belief and not control crying once we remembered the reason why we have to cry. So, cry, it will lessen the internal pressure brewing. We are not superhumans to not \u201cbleed\u201d when hurt by situations we cannot control. While there are bad reasons to cry, there are also good reasons to cry, that is, when we are happy. Some people cry because of happiness. They could not contain their emotions that crying is the only way to lessen the pressure of a welling emotion. It will make us calm within. Whether the reason for crying is bad or good, it is okay to cry. Credits : unsplashed  ",

            "answer_text": "Whenever you really need to. That may seem like a prosaic answer, but that\u2019s honestly what I think. If at all possible I think it\u2019s in one\u2019s best interest to remove him/herself from any public viewing when you gotta vent your sobbing. If someone feels enough pain to cry then that\u2019s what they should do and avoid any unnecessary scrutiny or judgment from witnesses who will not know how to respond or who will respond with apathetic, unkind, disparaging reactions or simply tone-deaf cluelessness. No one hurting to the point of tears should suffer any extra burden of an audience unless it can\u2019t be helped or it\u2019s perfectly fine with you. I remember when I lived in Moscow and was going through a very tough emotional time and I was crying on the subway in front of all these strangers. It didn\u2019t matter to me and that\u2019s what I needed to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost any time. And, of course, there is crying and there is crying. Full uncontrollable sobbing at a funeral is fine. It is not so fine in a classroom as a student full of other students. It is best to go outside and not become the subject of everyone\u2019s attention. As a frequent cryer, I have cried in front of an entire high school faculty and in front of an entire classroom of kids (several times). All those were appropriate. If your crying takes away someone else\u2019s moment, it is best to try to hold it back. If your crying is part of a moment, cry away. One more note. If the crying is impossible to stop, it is always \u201cokay\u201d. It is just not always okay to remain where you are when this happens \u2026.but, I would venture to say that most of the time it is okay to say put. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. Let me share a story here. It was a viva that was going on. We were 6 students giving that viva. There were two questions shot to us by two faculties. I was confused with first question and every time I kept telling them the wrong definition. The second question was a trick question. And the others answered wrong. But my answer was correct. Post that one faculty told the other one that I'm a good candidate, to which I politely disagreed because initially I had messed up. To this the faculty reacted by asking to fail me. Without even one moment tears started flowing. I couldn't even think of what was happening around me because I was too focussed on me failing in the subject part. I believe no one plans to cry. Its an emotion. Do you really think and plan before you smile or laugh? Its as natural as breathing. Of course you can control your emotions with practice and I now realise that in my viva I cried for no reason at all but I learnt controlling my emotions, only when required. I believe every feeling must be acknowledged and that's how you can live a normal and peaceful life. This aspect is very well shown in the animated movie : Inside Out. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I think that crying is a great release of stress and emotional turmoil. It's normal to cry with frustration, sadness, grief, happiness and sometimes anger. A person who forces themselves to withhold crying misses an opportunity to release stress and maybe move forward emotionally. If you stifle emotion, it could rear its ugly head at inappropriate times. You be the judge when and where it's appropriate to cry. Hopefully, it's not too often with sadness. ",

Like its ok for guys to use women for money? Manners, respect, waiting for sex, .....just a few....lol ",
