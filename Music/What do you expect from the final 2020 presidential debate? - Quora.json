            "answer_text": "Well first of all, I expect trump to come up with another attempt to call it off. He knows that he doesn\u2019t have strong enough arguments on many of his positions, and is very vulnerable to attack on his covid response and his tax avoidance in particular. But he also discovered last time, that a strategy of trying to bully his way through the debate and avoid those issues by constant interruption, played REALLY badly with the public. If it does go ahead, I suspect the tactic from trump might be to do what pence did in his debate - literally answer a different question than the one asked. He\u2019ll also try to use the whole \u201cHunter\u2019s laptop\u201d nonsense to discredit him. ",

Funny, they heard him say White Supremacy and the KKK, but they forgot the KKK because they are trying to associate White Supremacy with Trump. They don\u2019t mention the KKK, David Duke, Byrd, and the boys in pointy hats. ",
