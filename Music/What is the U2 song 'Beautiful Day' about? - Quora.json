            "answer_text": "From Walk On: The Spiritual Journey of U2 by Steve Stockman:  Beautiful Day was an interesting opening track for All That You Can't Leave Behind. The last track on U2's nineties catalog, as the entire world seemed caught up in a frenzy of apocalyptic doom and gloom, fearful about the ending of a millennium, was \"Wake up dead man.\" It was as though Jesus was in the tomb after his crucifixion, lifeless, with the disciples letting go of all hope. John Lennon's words \"the dream is over\" come to mind. \"Beautiful Day\" is like an ecstatic proclamation that Peter and James might have sung just after Mary had come back to the disciples' hiding place with the resurrection news. The biblical image used may be the dove going out from the ark to bring back the leaf that informed Noah that the old world had ended and a new one could begin. But even that depicts the whole celebratory mood of dead man waking up and a whole new Kingdom being birthed. The album and the Elevation tour would see a new resurrection shuffle of mood in the U2 camp. ",
