            "answer_text": "If he survives, Ezra would be 23 during ROTJ, Sabine a little older. TFA is set 30 years after ROTJ with Rey being 19 years old which would mean Ezra was around 34 when she was born. The numbers may work but when asked Pablo emphatically said No, Rey is not their child. Some fans are just hookup happy. ",
