            "answer_text": "Most popular DAWs, FL studio, Logic, Ableton Live, all have the same main functionalities. They may have some differences in the user interface (Ableton may be a bit more well suited for live recording, FL studio has piano roll features, etc.) but these all effectively do the same thing and won\u2019t limit you as a musician. Additionally, all three are heavily used and have many resources, tutorials, and forums related to their use. I would look for some quick tutorials on the basics of each before deciding which one you want to purchase, to see if you have an outright UI preference for any of them. If you are looking for a free DAW to experiment with before taking the leap into one, you might want to look into Garageband (comes free with a Mac and is basically a simplified Logic), Ableton Live Lite (stripped down version of Ableton Live), or Audacity.

            "answer_text": "I found lmms to be quite good starting out, but immediately got fl studio once I had the chance. INVEST IN FL STUDIO!!!. Seriously, if you buy fl, you'll get lifetime free updates as long as you have your login. Using FL Studio as a beginner helped me a lot, especially since there are more and better tutorials on it. So by all means go ahead and use lmms if you can't afford fl. But if you're serious about producing, buy FL. Trust me, your workflow will be much better, and it's easy to get the hang of, as long as you watch some tutorials ",
