Satan cannot have the soul of anyone who has put their faith in Jesus, so he must settle for taunting them. \u201c Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil\u2019s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\u201d Ephesians 6:10\u201312 Never take on the devil by yourself. Put on the Armor of God and declare the name of Jesus. \u201cResist the devil and he will flee.\u201d Sincerely, Karen ",

You get good at your job, you try to help the boss make the place work better, and he tosses you out because he\u2019s afraid you're trying to take over. Ungrateful bastard! Wouldn't you be pissed off? Just \u2019cause he's the boss, he thinks that makes him God? ",
