            "answer_text": "One Direction is an incredible band (yes, still a band, you can fight me over it). Where do I even start? Okay. Before we get into music, we have to talk about the boys in general. They're all really kind, genuine people. Their love for their fans runs deep, and they never stop thanking all the girls and even guys that have supported them along the way. They're almost always respectful (I'd say more Harry on this one though, man is a saint when it comes to kindess and being respectful), even towards people that have hurt them or the Directioners. I don't think fame has changed them. They are still the loving, compassionate, amazing people they were on the X Factor and early, fetus 1D days. I love love LOVE the fact they keep track of what is going on in the fandom and take the time to interact with the Directioners. It's amazing and shows how much they really do care about all the support they have received. Music. Their music really speaks to people. They have all sorts of different sounds. Such as FOUR, which has a more laid back acoustic sound. Made in the A.M. is more gentle. It's hard to describe the feeling that you get while listening to the boys sing. There is just something magical about it. ",
