            "answer_text": "I was just going to post the same. However, I tend more towards thinking there are 3 styles:  Slowdive fully utilized the elements of reverb and layers into an ethereal style frequently termed Dream Pop. If I had to pick a Slowdive song, 40 Days is good, but I think \"Alison\" is there most representative of that scene. Though my favorites are \"Richard\", \"I Believe\", and \"Avalon II\" Ride - Ride was also shoegaze, but had much more of an influence from/ and on Brit Pop. Bands like Galaxy 500 and Moose, etc.  Their song representing shoegaze the most (in my opinion) is \"Vapour Trail\", it's just amazing. I tend to classify My Bloody Valentine in their own category - Not as pop as either other two, especially far removed from Brit Pop. I feel they inspired a full host of shoegaze artists that wanted to experiment with noise, reverb and off pitch effects. \"When You Sleep\" sums this up perfectly. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd like to go back a little farther.The Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Never Understand\"   I saw this band during their first tour in the U.S. and this song was the first song I ever heard that used noise in this way. It was unrestrained and with an absence of control compared to the epic expanses of bands like Ride, MBV, and Slowdive. It formed the basis of bands I gravitated towards for the rest of my life. ",
