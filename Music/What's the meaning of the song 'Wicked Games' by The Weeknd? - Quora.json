            "answer_text": "It's about addiction (sexual and/or drugs), self hate, lack of self esteem and inability to cope with the day to day challenges this world deals everyone on an everyday basis. This song is about tragedy and being down on your life in general. Using others (the prostitute - that aint no stripper), drugs and all. The fame part is the power trip that every man - be he a politician or not - seams to believe he possesses over women and objects ... Giving money for sex is a power trip. ",
