            "answer_text": "Well, the distribution of music, at least in the U.S. (not sure about other countries, but I know this is how it is in my country), is governed through policies dictated by \u201cfair use\u201d. Basically, if the label doesn\u2019t give direct permission to stream the recording, then it cannot be streamed. Just like, when a singer samples another song, per copyright law, the singer has to get permission to use the sample from the other artist\u2019s song. Thanks for reading this short and sweet answer on Quora. ",
