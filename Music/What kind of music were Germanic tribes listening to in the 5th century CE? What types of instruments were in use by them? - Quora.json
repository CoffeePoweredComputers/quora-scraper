            "answer_text": "Now, I am not a music scholar by any means but there is not a heck of a lot of surviving material written about Ancient music and I am pretty certain that there isn't anything written down about fifth century Germanic tribal music. Hildegard von Bingen is the earliest named composer and she lived in the 12th century. We have zero idea what it actually sounded like because we don't know what kind of tuning system they used. Likely it wouldn't sound quite right to us in modern times because we are used to twelve tone equal temperament, which basically finally became a thing thanks to J.S. Bach, although the ancient Greeks gave it some thought. Your tribesman may have used pentatonic, heptatonic, ten tone\u2026 or who knows what. We do know about Roman and Greek music to a degree and there are some surviving fragments of their music notation and pictures (mosaics)/sculpture of instruments and musicians. We can make some guesses at Roman music based on the structure of surviving poems and lyrics and the fact that they basically ripped off the Greeks. Ancient Greek music forms part of the basis of our modern musical system/language. As for instruments for these tribesman\u2026probably some woodwind or flute-like instruments. Romans had flutes distantly related to modern ones. They had reed woodwinds too. Whistles, pan-pipes and maybe some bagpipes\u2026 Romans had those. Certainly drums and various percussion instruments. Also rattles and the like. Think rain shaker or maraca like things\u2026and of course voice. Voice is the universal human instrument. Maybe, maybe, if the tribes or their neighbors had been in contact with Romans some of the stringed instruments like lyres (which the Romans stole from the Greeks) or cithara might be around. The Romans also had a fretted lute like instrument similar to the pandura. Maybe something with a fingerboard and frets. Music and instruments tend to get around in history. Fifth century Germanic tribes probably had different instruments or variations of other ancient instruments that are forgotten about or evolved in parallel but it's all conjecture because no one wrote it down. Germanic tribesman probably wouldn't have \u201cbrass\u201d instruments like the Roman horn or the tuba, which was a tubular trumpet like thing, because metal was ridiculously valuable or in the wilds. Same for cymbals. Bronze for example would have been far too valuable in a large amount to be used for an instrument unless it was for a king etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Remember what happen when the barbarians where at the gate? It is quite possible that they used the same musical instruments they took from the spoils of overrunning Roman civilization during the 5th Century. As far as musical instruments It has been documented that the Lyre was the most important string instruments of the Germanic tribes although we can only guess at what tuning was used as there is also influences from the Celts. The other Roman instruments such as percussion and horns were used in battle for bugle calls. Not sure what the Germanic tribes did for fun with these instruments but they also had heroic songs and tribal chants. ",
