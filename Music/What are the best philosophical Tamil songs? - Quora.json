Kadavul Thantha ...from Maayavi  Secret of Success from Boys  Ok. Vijay is following trend of Superstar and MGR of singing philosophical songs as intro songs in his recent movies. But this one is ARR special   Satham illada from Amarkalam. Meaningful lyrics.  Following song is about betrayal. I haven't come across any song or movie that is close about betrayal and pain of betrayal by closed ones.

I will try to recall some from the top off my head:  1.NINAIPPADHELLAM NADANTHU VITTAL..(Nenjil Or Aalayam)    2.MAYAKKAMA KALAKKAMA (Sumaithaangi)    3.BUDDHIYULLA MANIDHARELLAM (Annai - J.P.Chandrababu)   4.PIRAKKUMPODHUM AZHUGINRAAY ( Kavalai Illadha Manithan)    5.PARTHA PASUMARAM (Thiruvilayadal)    6.UNNAI NINAICHEN PAATU PADICHEN (Apoorva Sahodharargal)    7.MARANAATHAI ENNI KALANGIDUM (Karnan) :This song can be considered the quintessence of Bhagawad Geetha, in lyrical Tamil.   8.MANITHAN ENBAVAN (Sumaithaangi)  Philosophical songs need not be only sad or pessimistic, but they can be inspirational or optimistic too.   9.THOONGATHEY THAMBI THOONGATHEY ( Nadodi Mannan) I wonder how Sharanya Sunderamoorthy missed this ;-)   10.THOLVI NILAYENA NINAITHAL (Oomai Vizhigal)    11.OVVORU POOKKALUME (Autograph)    12 KANAVU KAANUM VAAZHKKAI (Neengal Kaettavai) My personal favorite,and mother of all philosophical songs,imo.
