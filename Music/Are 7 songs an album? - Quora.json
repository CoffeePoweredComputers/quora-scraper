            "answer_text": "Yes, there are albums with 7 songs, some with even less. It may depend on the length of the tracks, 7 songs at 3 minutes is only 21 minutes which is a bit short for an album, but it still could be one. There is an album by the Pet Shop Boys called Introspective which only has 6 tracks, but each track is an extended mix and over 6 minutes long. ",
