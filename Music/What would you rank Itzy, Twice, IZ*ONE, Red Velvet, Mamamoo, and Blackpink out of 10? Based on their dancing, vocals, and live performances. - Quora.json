            "answer_text": "There are many answers to this already but I thought it\u2019ll be fun if I tagged along and rate these talented groups. I\u2019ll also be adding some more categories to spice things up a little bit. So here are my opinions on these talented ladies: *I decided to not rate Iz*One as I don\u2019t follow them that much THE SCORING 9\u201310 = Exceptional 7\u20138 = Great 5\u20136 = Solid 3\u20134 = Weak 1\u20132 = Don\u2019t Even _________________________________________ TWICE Vocals : 6/10I think TWICE have very reliable and perfect vocals for a KPOP Group. You have Jihyo their power main vocal that adds that extra umph to songs and Nayeon who can take on any chorus that\u2019s given to her, also voices like Sana which I think is the perfect cute kpop voice cause it\u2019s actually endearing to listen to. But other than that I don\u2019t think they have any standout vocalists that can give them a higher rating. Jihyo, Nayeon and Jeongyeon are great though but the others are just decent. Dance : 9/10TWICE has one of the best female kpop dancers up their sleeves and a great dance line in general with dancers like Mina, Sana and Jihyo. Other than that they are also mostly synchronized yet shine in their own ways which I think is a huge plus. Even their weaker dancers like Dahyun is still a very clean dancer and I wouldn\u2019t even call her weak. Live Performances : 9/10TWICE has really great energy and stage which makes their performances a worth to watch. Facial expressions and charisma are great and you can see the members really enjoy performing for the audience, the chemistry they have is also popping on stage. Overall these girls are great performers. I noticed they had a bit of a slump with their stage presence but I think it\u2019s reasonable as they have been seriously overworked. Stability : 7/10TWICE members are pretty stable when performing their songs. It\u2019s just when they\u2019re given more challenging lines they tend to avoid it or not execute them as well which makes me lessen their rating. Despite this they still get the job done and none of the members are fully incapable of being stable so it\u2019s perfectly fine. Rap : 6/10Chaeyoung is a really talented rapper and I wish JYP would let her utilize her true potential someday and give her proper raplines. With that said I think Chaeyoung really saves TWICE in rapping because aside from Chaeyoung there\u2019s not much to say about the other rappers like are Dahyun and Momo. I think Momo has potential yet JYP won\u2019t give her raplines and with Dahyun I think she\u2019s just too much of a forced rapper but she\u2019s still decent though. Overall : 7,4/102. ITZY  Vocals : 5/10Yikes I\u2019m sorry for the very low rating but this is my opinion so feel free to disagree. I think Lia\u2019s a very talented singer who\u2019s just constantly given lines out of her range, but I do have to agree that she may not be that much of a Main Vocalist Material. Yeji and Chaeryoung are relatively stable singers that gets the job done, with Ryujin & Yuna I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to say about them as they primarily talksing. Still they are rookies so room for improvement is still there. Dance : 9/10Itzy\u2019s biggest strength lies in their dancing. All of them are very talented dancers even their weakest dancer Lia is still pretty good. 3 of them are Main Dancer Material with Yuna as a very strong Lead Dancer, add that with their synchronization and you have one heck of a dance group. I personally don\u2019t think they have some of the best dancers in the industry but they are all very close in dancing skill which makes them the most cohesive female dance group there is. It\u2019s the perfect balance. Live Performances : 6/10The synchronized dancing is really satisfying to watch and it pulls you to check more of their performances not to mention the Rookie energy they exude. But that\u2019s the problem, I think they need to spice things up a little bit as they tend to just stick to the script and call it a day which is not bad per say but it can be sort of boring and predictable to watch sometimes. Stability : 6/10Pretty much all the members are stable and can handle their lines decently. I hate to say it because it\u2019s not really her fault but Lia might need more work as she tends to struggle with her highnotes sometimes. Despite being rookies they\u2019re still somewhat stable overall. Rap : 5/10Their rapping aren\u2019t that spectacular but it\u2019s still solid overall. Ryujin does her job well enough as the Main Rapper and Yuna should be the designated Lead Rapper from now on cause she has so much potential for rapping. Yeji, Chaeryeong and Lia are also considered rappers but I think there\u2019s really no standouts among them but it still works in general. Overall : 6,2/103. RED VELVET  Vocals : 9/10Was there ever a doubt? Wendy is one of the best singers in the third generation which alone should explain their rating but then you have Seulgi as a poweful Lead Vocalist and a bunch of talented vocalists like Joy, Yeri and Irene that overall makes them a strong vocal group. Aside from that they are also able to harmonize well which is a huge plus and the runs & riffs they do are just chef\u2019s kiss. No complaints. Dance : 7/10Red Velvet has some intriguing choreography and you need some real good dancers to pull them off. Luckily they have Seulgi who\u2019s such a fantastic dancer and of course the beauty with the underrated dancing skills Irene. Their dance line I\u2019d say is strong but the other dancers are average but still great nevertheless. They are also able to be pretty synchronized with their dancing nowadays which gives more edge to their dancing prowess. Live Performances : 7/10They aren\u2019t the best at Stage Presence but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s bad in general. Seulgi\u2019s charisma mixed with Wendy\u2019s energy enhances their performance making it very enjoyable to watch. Joy can also be such a gem in some performances, same can be said with Yeri & Irene. Overall the three of them just lack in consistency but I\u2019d say they make up pretty good performances overall. Rap : 4/10Yup we just hit Red Velvet\u2019s weak spot \u201crapping\u201d. For someone who doesn\u2019t even like rapping I find Irene to be a good enough rapper but still lacking in general. I\u2019d say idol wise their rapping isn\u2019t really as bad as people make it up to be. Yeri, Joy and Wendy are overall a bunch of good Idol Lead Rappers which definitely helps the group as a whole. But in general they still lack a really strong rapper to pull off impressive raps. Stability : 9/10Red Velvet can be really stable on performances despite their songs being more on the difficult side. Their songs in general has a few riffs & runs and I\u2019m surprised they still manage to do most of them live not to mention the highnotes they have to do and luckily they nail those notes. Overall : 7,2/104. MAMAMOO  Vocals : 10/10It goes without saying that Mamamoo is just filled with crazy talented singers. All of them are basically fit for a Main/Lead vocal position which makes them a very strong vocal group. Those powerful and robust chest belts are done amazingly by Solar and then you still have Wheein and Hwasa with their amazing melismas not to mention Moonbyul. Most of their songs just gives me goosebumps because of how vocally talented they are. Dance : 5/10Mamamoo isn\u2019t a group that is specialized in dancing but they\u2019re still pretty good dancers especially Wheein and Moonbyul. In every performance they are able to make up their more raw dance moves with their amazing stage presence and rythm to the music. I think they are all natural dancers who are just less polished compared to other groups. Live Performances : 10/10Mamamoo gets a perfect score and there\u2019s a damn good reason for that. For me personally their performances are the least artificial compared to most groups as they are able to connect and hype up the crowd with their amazing energy and facials. They bring so much flavor to their performances especially in award shows so it would be a crime to not rate them this high. Stability : 8/10The members of Mamamoo are definitely stable while singing live. I really wanted to give them a higher rating but because of their easier choreography I think there needs to be more showcase on how stable they can be for more accurate proof. Nonetheless they still get a very high rating because of how well they execute their lines especially knowing that most of them fall more to the challenging side of singing. Rap : 9/10Moonbyul is one of the best female rappers this newer generation has to offer. Of course there are a few other girls here that have also written some raps but not to the extent of Moonbyul, she has the best lyrical credibility out of these groups and her delivery with that deep voice is just golden. Aside from her we also have Hwasa here who\u2019s not half bad and brings much of her own character to her raps which can make up for lack of technicalities. Overall : 8,4/105. BLACKPINK  Vocals : 5/10Blackpink isn\u2019t particularly known as a group with strong vocals hence why the low rating. Even though they aren\u2019t technically that proficient they still go for that signature YG sound that I personally think adds more crisp to their singing. Each members voices are very distinguishable and the diversity of it is what makes them still platable and enjoyable to listen to. Dance : 7/10Lisa may not be the best of the best but she\u2019s still one heck of a dancer and does her job well as Blackpink\u2019s main dancer, for Ros\u00e9 she\u2019s honestly one of the strongest female lead dancers in this newer generation which makes a very formidable dance line. Jennie and Jisoo is okay but none of them standout in a bad way so their dance performances can be very enjoyable to watch. I just wish they would start to do more challenging choreographies. Live Performances : 7/10If they are able to keep up the consistency they did at Coachella they\u2019d have a way higher rating, but even then I still don\u2019t think what they have now is remotely bad despite what many people say. To me the members put together just exude a charisma and aura that I can\u2019t explain, somehow YG did something right for once by making such a bomb ayuss chemistry for stages. Many may disagree with that but I still stand by that Blackpink are a bunch of bad b\u2019s. Stability : 4/10They\u2019ve definitely seen improvement here and there but it\u2019s still not much, I rated them this low because I also took account that they had way much more time compared to other groups to improve yet it\u2019s still in need of some work. Their choreos are easier and when it\u2019s someone\u2019s time to sing they are given more easier dances (like just sassing it up by flailing) but they somehow still struggle on keeping a stable note. They gon\u2019 do a comeback on Friday though so I might get a clown award later on. Rap : 8/10As they come from YG entertainment it is expected for them to have excellent rappers. I believe Jennie & Lisa are amazing rappers that just needs better opportunities to showcase their skills like given awesome rap lines and chances to write their own raps. While I do think they aren\u2019t quite on par with their seniors they are still formidable Idol Rappers who are deserving of this rating. Overall : 6,2/10TL:DR MAMAMOO : 8,4/10TWICE : 7,4/10RED VELVET : 7,2/10ITZY : 6,2/10BLACKPINK : 6,2/10Again this is just my personal thoughts and there might be many incorrections so feel free to tell me about it in the comments!

            "answer_text": "These are my ratings with reasoning. Please respect my opinion! Mamamoo  Vocals: 10/10 I think it's pretty obvious why I put their rating as 10/10 for vocals. All the members are amazing vocalists and could each be the main vocalist in any other group. Dance: 4/10 Dance is something Mamamoo does not specialize in. I'm not saying they're bad at dance, but they're choreographies are very simple and no one knows them for dance. Rap: 8/10 Mamamoo has one rapper that represents them in rap, Moonbyul. She writes a lot of lyrics for their songs, and has a good flow. Hwasa is also a decent rapper. Live Performances: 10/10 I think Mamamoo's live performances are something else. They're live vocals are spot on, and they are very creative with the lyrics live also. Stage Prescence: 7/10 Because they're performances are often more lighthearted and fun, I gave them a 7/10, but when they have charismatic stages the stage prescence goes up. Red Velvet  Vocals: 9/10 Red Velvet is also a great vocal group. Each member has a very distinct voice and I think it's what they're most known for. Dance: 6/10 Selugi and Irene are powerhouse dancers and the other members are pretty decent. Rap : 4/10 Red Velvet is definitely not a rap group. They aren't too steady while rapping, and don't have the best flow either. Live Performances : 7/10 They're live performances are nice too watch. A little boring at times, but Seulgi brings in a lot of stage prescence to the group. Stage Prescence : 6/10 Like I said before, Red Velvet's are nice but a little bit boring also. Twice  Vocals: 6/10 Twice has Jihyo, Jeongyeon and Nayeon, all decent vocalists. But the rest are not on the same level. That is why I chose to give them a 6/10. Dance: 8/10 I don't even need to say this. Oh well. Momo. I won't forget Mina, Jihyo, or Sana either. The other dancers are not bad either. Rap: 5/10 Don't get me wrong. I think Chaeyoung is a great Rapper. She even writes her own lyrics. But other than her and Dahyun, there aren't any strong rappers in the group. Live Performances: 8/10 I really enjoy Twice's live performances. They are quite refreshing to watch, especially with the newer concepts. Stage Prescence: 9/10 Twice has a lot of stage prescence and charisma, and it attracts a lot of people, fans or non fans. BlackPink  Vocals: 5/10 BlackPink doesn't have the best vocals. I think it's mostly because they weren't trained properly, so their voices sound forced a lot of the time. Dance: 7/10 Blackpink is a good dance group. They're choreos are nice to watch and learn, and they perform them well too. Although the members are not on the same level as Lisa, they work well together. Rap: 9/10 Blackpink is a rap group. They have two of the most renowned rappers in the 3rd generation. Live Performances: 6/10 Blackpink's live performances are okay. They could be more energetic, but there's always more room to improve. Stability: 4/10 I know many Blinks will disagree with me, but Blackpink is not a stable group. They can't maintain breath easily, and they're overall sounds is not good. IZ*ONE  Vocals: 8/10 I really like IZ*ONE's vocal line. They sound very fresh, which is kind of like their concept. Dance: 9/10 IZ*ONE is one of the most synchronized groups out there. They also have Chaeyeon, probably one of the best 4th gen dancers right now. Rap: 5/10 IZ*ONE isn't trained as well in rap as the other skills. Yena is a decent main rapper, but she sounds like your average Main rapper. Live Performances: 9/10 Because IZ*ONE's dances are so synchronized, it makes the live performances so nice to watch. Most of the members also have a lot of energy. Stability: 7/10 IZ*ONE is pretty stable. There's still a little bit of shakiness in their voices, but they'll get better over time. Itzy  Vocals: 5/10 Itzy is not a vocal group. They have one good Vocalist, Lia, and then the rest are average or below average. Dance: 9/10 Itzy is a dance group. They're choreographies are so well choreographed, and they have a contrast of power and fluidity in their dance. Rap: 7/10 I don't think any of the members are individually exceptional at rap, but combined they make a good rap team. Live Performances: 9/10 Like I said earlier about their dances, Itzy's dances are really nice to watch, and they're very charismatic on stage. Stability: 5/10 Itzy is still not a very stable group. They're only stable member is Chaeryoung, and the rest sound very shouty. Over time they will improve their stability. Hope you enjoyed my rating! ",
