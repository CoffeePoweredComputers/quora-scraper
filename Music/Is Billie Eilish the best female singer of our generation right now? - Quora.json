            "answer_text": "(Were you being serious? I sure hope not. But I\u2019ll give you an answer anyway)   Objectively speaking, she is far from it. Or at least based on what she\u2019s shown us so far. I\u2019m gonna list everything impressive about her singing: She has good breath controlShe has a good rangeShe has alright techniqueWhy she\u2019s not the best: She can\u2019t project her voice very wellHer voice isn\u2019t versatileShe lacks powerOr at least this is based off of what I\u2019ve seen. She also hasn\u2019t reallly experimented that much which you\u2019d think she woulda done by now. There are many artists who can do so much better at all these things. (Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato and Jessie J all come to mind). (Keep in mind, I\u2019m not a vocal coach of any sort. This is just based off of knowledge I\u2019ve picked it from Vocal Coach REACTS videos of my favourite singers)  Anyway thanks for reading :) (I do not own this image, thank Google Images) ",

I\u2019m not depressed or anything so her songs kind of just creep me out and I know a lot of adults who feel the same way that there kind of just so slow and strange that it\u2019s hard to like. ",
