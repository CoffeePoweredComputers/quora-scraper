            "answer_text": "The reason is simple. The production of sound through an open tube requires air to be blown perpendicular to any one of the open faces of the tube as we generally do with the pen caps to produce sound in class to irritate our teachers(i have done that a lot).  What happens is that a standing wave is generated across the the tube whose wavelength is just double of the length of tube. If for an instance the flute has it's blowing hole and the next open hole 10 cm apart, then sound of wavelength 20cm (hence frequency 1650 Hz) will be produced. So, as the distance between the blowing hole and the open hole is varied by closing and opening the holes at different distances , sound of different frequencies is produced one at a time and the musician plays the air instrument be it a flute, a trumpet, a saxophone etc ; all work on the same mechanism. If air is blown with greater force then sound of greater frequency(second octave or the next overtone) is produced ",
