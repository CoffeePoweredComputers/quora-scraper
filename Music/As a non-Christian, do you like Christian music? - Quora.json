            "answer_text": "I grew up with classical music in the house, and two parents who sang in both church choir and in the community choral ensemble. They sang everything from the obligatory Handel\u2019s Messiah every Christmas, to Milhaud\u2019s King David (we got Vincent Price to do the narration), to Mozart\u2019s Grand Mass in C, to Beethoven\u2019s Missa Solemnis (of which my father, a tenor, said, \u201cThat deaf bastard was lucky he never had to sing this!\u201d, referring to the very difficult ending of the Gloria). . . So I grew up with plenty of Christian music in that sense, and I enjoy it still. As for contemporary Christian music. . . I used to have to drive across the western United States, several times a year, in a pickup truck with a tapedeck and a radio. And by the time I\u2019d hit New Mexico, I\u2019d usually played all my tapes and desperately needed a change. . . but there were long stretches of New Mexico where the only radio stations I could get were either country music stations (which, at the time, were all playing LeAnn Rimes\u2019s \u201cHow Do I Live\u201d fifty bazillion times a day), or this statewide network of contemporary Christian radio stations called M88. So sometimes, for a change, I\u2019d find an M88 station and roll through Moriarty or Gallup or Tucumcari cranking, oh, Plankeye and Third Day and Rebecca St. James and World Wide Message Tribe, back in the day. . . . . . and what always struck me was that it all sounded exactly the same as what was on the secular pop/rock stations. You could match up almost every song on Maximum 88 with a close analogue on the secular charts. It was like Darwin contemplating Australian mammals. Third Day sounded to me like they\u2019d gone through Creed\u2019s garbage looking for songs (and Creed always sounded to me like they\u2019d gone through Pearl Jam\u2019s garbage looking for their songs). When there was a brief revival of swing music, with secular artists like the Brian Setzer Orchestra and the Squirrel Nut Zippers getting airplay and charting a few hits. . . the Christian music industry came up with the W\u2019s, who obligedly cranked out a swingin\u2019 single whose chorus went \u201cYou are the Devil and the Devil is BAD!\u201d repeatedly. There was Christian grunge, Christian female singer-songwriter Lilith Fair-type stuff, and one night at 3 in the morning I came across Christian death metal. (Lyrics: grraggghhrrr rrhgraaggghhh aargghhraaggg JESUS ghhraawwrrgg!!!) At the time, what struck me about the whole listening experience was that the industry was taking what is, supposedly, the most revolutionary message in the history of mankind, and packaging it so that it perfectly conformed to the standards of the world. Sociologically, it showed that at least some American Christians live in a sort of mirror world that\u2019s exactly like the secular world except it\u2019s all about Jesus. So a kid can go to Christian schools that will teach Christian math and Christian biology, and play Christian video games, and listen to Christian grunge and Christian emo, and go to Christian music festivals and Christian haunted houses at Halloween. . . precisely like his counterparts in the secular world, except with everything branded as \u201cChristian\u201d. And while M88 did relieve tedium on long drives, I was never moved to seek out any of the artists I heard. EDIT: And I forgot to mention: Old hymns can be beautiful\u2014\u201dOh! For A Thousand Tongues To Sing\u201d, or \u201cCome, Thou Fount Of Every Blessing\u201d, or \u201cThere Is A Balm In Gilead\u201d, or \u201cGuide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah\u201d. . . . On the other hand: \u201cPraise songs,\u201d or anything that involves raising your hands in the air? Barf. ",

Classical music or opera, which often was written to express religious themes? I like quite a few. Contemporary music with religious overtones but no specific Christian message? Certainly, especially if we're talking about Johnny Cash or the older U2, even some Flyleaf and Jars of Clay. But actual Christian music? Like the put your hands into the air and your heart into the prayer kind of music? I don't see any point to it. Some of it doesn't make me puke, but why would anyone not believing identify with a song about belief? And hell, I say this even though I'm pretty sure I still know all the words to Jesus Freak. It's the same reason I don't enjoy rap music about money, drugs and anonymous hookups\u2014it just doesn't have anything to do with the way I do or want to live my life. Oh, and on all counts, Creed and Sandi Patty are the worst things Christians have ever done to music, and you should all be ashamed! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written before about the Indian version of secularism. One aspect of it was that my school, with 99% Hindu students, celebrated Christmas Eve every year by decorating the corridors with paper cut-outs of holly and Christmas trees, little stars of David and angels. We would be treated to a half hour-long play by our fellow students enacting the story of Mary and Joseph and the three kings who visited the baby Jesus in his manger in Bethlehem. Interspersed were the beautiful carols from our student choir.. \u201cSilent Night, Holy Night...\u201d \u201cWe Three Kings of Orient are..\u201d Every one of us knew and loved these songs. They were spiritually uplifting. A good man was born, and the world celebrated his birth. And then we would have a speech that talked about the values of Christianity. Charity. Bearing good-will to your fellow human beings. About how \u2019twas a season of joy, of hope, introspection, family, prayer and love. Then more choir songs.. \u201cA holly jolly Christmas\u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s beginning to look a lot like Christmas\u2026\u201d Followed by the story of a certain reindeer.. \u201cYou know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen\u2026\u201d We were children and a finale with Santa was inevitable. The fattest lad in eight grade squeezed into the red costume of that beloved midnight marauder and handed out presents to kindergartners from a huge red sack. He danced around the audience, and the choir rang out.. \u201cYou better watch out, you better not cry\u2026\u201d As a non-Christian (atheist, actually), I can safely say Christmas carols are a form of Christian music I deeply enjoy.

But a couple Christian music songs that I still enjoy include:  Show You Love - Jars of Clay  Breakfast Song - Newsboys  Colored People - DC Talk - This one has a pretty universal message too.  Be of Good Cheer - Petra And of course is this cover of U2\u2019s Sunday Bloody Sunday by Christian band Pillar, that I actually like more than the original.  ",

But Baroque pieces such as Jesu, joy of man\u2019s desiring by Bach, or obviously Handel\u2019s Messiah, are great. I also like the older Christmas carols (Silent Night, yes; Rudolph, no), and there\u2019s a very comforting simplicity in church hymns. You can almost always predict the intervals, and they\u2019re not challenging to a untrained singer. I like the music of the pipe organ, whether it\u2019s Christian or secular. The ending of Jerusalem is absolutely spine-tingling:  I\u2019m also particularly fond of the Finlandia hymn (\u201cBe Still My Soul\u201d) as sung by Izzy Cooper (apologies for the video quality):  ",

On my primary Spotify playlist, I have Jars of Clay, Creed, and Skillet (I also have EVERYTHING Collective Soul\u2026marginally Christian, but it\u2019s there). I like good music.

There are a few exceptions though, especially if you loosely interpret Christian Music to include music that is written by Christian artists, but that\u2019s cheating! My favourite Christian Band is Stryper.  This criminally underrated group tried to unite two peoples who hate each other under a common flag of black and yellow. Metalheads and any sort of religious types rarely get along, but Stryper forced the issue. While touring with Anthrax (a massive name in metal in case you\u2019re unaware) they once decided to throw bibles into the crowd, to much uh\u2026 let\u2019s say criticism. There is a phrase used in the heavy metal community to describe daring acts of not giving a shit about what people think of you such as this; \u201cMetal as fuck\u201d. These blokes are just that. For a more in-depth look at the band; check out Razor\u2019s view on the subject. The guy knows his stuff, and is a total badass;  There\u2019s also a music genre called Unblack Metal, but I\u2019ll leave that investigation to you, should you wish to undertake such a journey. ",

Although I don\u2019t care about the message behind their songs but nevertheless I do agree that they sound good and in live shows they are one of the tightest sounding band. Michael Sweet is an excellent vocalist and what\u2019s even more commendable is the way he has maintained his vocals.   Other than them I also like the first three albums of Mortification, they are a Christian Extreme Metal band, and I have to admit they were indeed an excellent Death/Thrash Metal band. But the quality of their albums after \u201cPost Momentary Affliction\u201d went down the gutter. They changed their vocal style from Death/Thrash grunts and rasps to weak sounding groove metal and punk style vocals, they switched from playing dirty and dark sounding Death/Thrash to groovy nu-metal like garbage. In simple words they utterly ruined those albums.   ",

Others have recommended some great things - I\u2019d like to put a word in for this:  (I find Ray Nance\u2019s solo violin paraphrase that follows this even more astonishing.) I love the music of the Church of England, from which I parted company a long time ago. Here\u2019s a haunting, enigmatic fifteenth century thing in a twentieth century setting by the unsurpassably named Boris Ord\u2026  Spot the connection with this (coming up) - think very hard\u2026(Setting by the fascinating Elizabeth Poston, an unlikely friend of EM Forster who lived near her.)  On a roll now. Here\u2019s a setting of an ancient New Year Carol by Benjamin Britten (a ferocious Brahms-hater, by the way).  Whoever put Ralph Vaughan Williams in charge of the music for The English Hymnal knew what he was about. Its predecessor, Hymns Ancient and Modern, has a fair amount of dead wood in it\u2026 but it also has things like this\u2026  Evangelical folk\u2026 does it strike you as odd that people like Duke Ellington and Benjamin Britten (who both did lots of things that I assume you wouldn\u2019t consider compatible with Christian living) can convey such a sense of the transcendent and the perfect - and do so infinitely better than any ensemble of solid, prayerful purveyors of Christian dadrock? (My fondness for the linked-things above in no way prevents me from revering Frank Zappa, of course.) ",
