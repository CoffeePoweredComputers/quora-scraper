            "answer_text": "The One Piece, I think, is a concept or an experience. It can't be any particular materialistic thing. It is mostly going to be a combination of the following: The truth behind the void century - It is pretty obvious by now that the truth behind the Ancient Kingdom suddenly disappearing, and the World Government taking over will be revealed at Raftel, the final island in the Grand Line. This will also help Robin achieve her dream. This truth is the World Government's most guarded secret and will lead to an all out war between an alliance of pirates led by the King of Pirates (Luffy after reaching Raftel) and the World Government.Ancient Weapons - The disastrous ancient weapons which can and have been used to annihilate one island at a time will be revealed, and will be destroyed forever by the Straw Hat Pirates. I believe there will be a duel between Blackbeard and Luffy at Raftel over these weapons, which Luffy will win with help from his Nakama, and the native population of Raftel (See the next point). The Straw hat he wears is intricately linked to these weapons, it could be a key that allows them to self destruct. I think the ship Pluton will be there as well, though it will not be in a good condition. This will be crucial for Franky.Natives of Raftel - It is completely possible that Raftel has a native population. These people have been cut off completely from the world by the World Government after destroying the Ancient Kingdom because they are too strong for the Government. There can be many reasons why they can't leave Raftel, Devil fruits, unavailability of Log Pose or Ships, mystic forces of the island itself, etc. Roger could have promised the natives that when the Straw Hat returns to Raftel, it will lead to their search for ultimate redemption coming to a close. However the natives will be introduced into the story, they will lead to the discovery and realisation of the One Piece. If you are not convinced, think about this: Every place that the Straw Hats visit, they learn about the place and it's problems and help them resolve it. The natives of each place help them. And so will the natives of Raftel.The All Blue - The ocean which has fishes from all over the world will be discovered, by destroying the Red Line and merging all 4 seas. This destruction of Red Line will be closely linked to the destruction of the Ancient Weapons. All Blue itself, would become a treasure more precious than any amount of gold.Gold - There will be gold, yes. But no one would care, except for Nami, maybe.World Map - Since I mentioned Nami, another part of the One Piece would be the completed world map, first of it's kind. Maybe even a new kind of Log Pose deviced with Ussop's help.Shodai Kitetsu - The only sword that could rival Hawk Eye Mihawk's Yoru, will be found at Raftel. Zoro will Earn the right to wield it, and use it for his rematch with Mihawk.The All Curing Herb - I am not particularly sure about this, but I believe Chopper will eventually fulfill his dream of being able to cure any and all diseases. Maybe this will also happen on Raftel itself.The Will of D - The family of D are most likely to be the descendants of the Ancient Kingdom, and they are always fighting to reclaim the lost island. The will of D will be revealed in detail.End of a Daring Adventure - The journey in pursuit of the One Piece will be the most valuable thing for Luffy. That will be his One Piece.All of the above is my guess based on what I have watched. Do let me know what you think. ",

            "answer_text": "I love it. Its not offend someone addresses the other term for romantic. And the story really is a \u201cromantic dawn adventure\u201d Luffy in my opinion is a very beautiful character who shows compassion and love for others yet at the same time can seem violant and selfish to those who are considered corrupt. Oda shows a different side of a story which i think thats why one piece has been around for so long and why its still considered the best anime ever made. (At least in the sense of gross sells value and fanbase who actually donate lots of money to one piece.) And Thats a thing too. One piece, once a character touchs your heart, you stick with the series to the end. Once you realize that, you kinda in a sense become a crew member on the strawhats ship, talkin about \u201cill be here till the end\u201d just like everyone else on the crew who has said \u201cI'll follow luffy till the end\u201d. And that's actually in the LITERAL sense of romanticism thats not only displayed in the show/manga, but also in the fans. Thats a talent. Oda really needs to start getting more rewards or respect toward being an author. Anyway, those are my thoughts, i love the series. It keeps me guessing whats going to happen in the end but it is long. And i totally understand the people who say liked a different crew aside the strawhats but that character died and you fell out of love with the series. Talkin bout, you went down with your Captain, you didnt stick around because you went to see davy jones. I get it. ",
