            "answer_text": "Hello,Yes it records the voice that is coming out of your mouth. Microphones record your voice in the way that other people hear your voice. We hear our own voices slightly different than other people because of a few reasons. When we speak, we are hearing the sound of our voices vibrating within our skulls. That sound vibrates your skull, your jaw, your inner ear and your throat.As our voices leave our mouth, it travels up the sides of our faces, along the cheeks to our ears (this is called \u201cpreview).We are also hearing our voices interact with the environment we are in: at our desk, bedroom, bathroom, outside. This interaction of our voices bouncing off of hard objects and being absorbed by soft or squishy objects also influences how we hear our voices.A microphone only picks up the sound the travels through the air into the environment around us, It cannot hear preview or the sound vibrating in your head. This is why your recorded voice sounds different than how you always har your voice. Also, the quality of the microphone will influence how your voice sounds when recorded. Cellphone microphones are designed to pick up speech over a lot of background noise, so they do not record the lower, warmth of your voice that you hear. Expensive studio microphones are better at recording your voice as other people hear it, but even then its never exactly how you hear it. Kevin Richardshttp://www.rpmvocalstudio.com ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes, for the most part. Long answer: What you hear when you speak isn't how other people hear you; sad but true. You could say a recording is the only way for a person to experience their 'real' voice. How so? Human skull is made of bone, and it conducts whatever sound is produced by the vocal folds. When you hear someone else speak, you only experience sound which 'travels by air' to your ears. There is no vibration and no bone conduction involved. However, your own speech is different in that you can hear it not only from it outside but from inside as well. When you speak, vibrations are conducted both through the air and through bone and various tissues - straight to your cochlea (a part of the inner ear). Without realising it, you can hear shifts in pressure and other internal processes. Obviously, you're going to sound different to others. They cannot hear those things. By the way, you 'real' voice is a bit higher than how you perceive it. This is due to, again, bone conduction, since it works best with lower frequencies. I know most people don't like how they sound on recordings, and I know 99.9999% of people sound just fine to my own ears IRL. I guess it's just weird hearing the difference between what you experience on a daily basis and what you've been told is your actual voice. Although audio equipment cannot capture voice how humans experience it for the simple reason that it's not an ear, it's as close to 'real' as it gets - and much, much closer than how you experience your own voice.
