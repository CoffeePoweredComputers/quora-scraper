(\uc5b4\ub514\uc5d0\uc11c \uc654\ub294\uc9c0) - Color Coded Lyrics  I don\u2019t think that every song can be used fully because of the little details of places and names BTS gives. But you can always change that. I\u2019ll say this again. I do not intend to offend anyone with any of these lyrics. ",
