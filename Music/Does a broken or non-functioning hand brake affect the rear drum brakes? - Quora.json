            "answer_text": "If you have the type of vehicle with rear drum brakes, that uses the rear service brakes as a parking brake, it could have an effect. Parking brakes that use the rear drum brakes have a lever that forces the shoes apart to use them as a parking brake. If the parking brake isn\u2019t working because the shoes are worn out, then they probably aren\u2019t working as service brakes either, with all the braking effort happening at the front brakes.  (From ASE study guide) If the parking brake isn\u2019t working because of a broken, rusted, or out of adjustment brake cable, then it shouldn\u2019t have any effect on the rear drum brakes since none of the effort used to apply the parking brake is reaching the brakes. So, if your parking brake is broken or non-functioning, you may want to have it looked at. If the shoes are worn out, then you are probably relying on your front brakes for all the stopping power, which will wear them out faster and won\u2019t give you full stopping power, If the rear brakes aren\u2019t affected, you still have a broken parking brake, something that you need to pass inspection, and for your own safety.

            "answer_text": "Does a broken or non-functioning hand brake affect the rear drum brakes? :If the cable came off the lever, well, nothing would ever pull the lever. In the one instance where the cable is frozen and in the position where it is already pulling on the park brake lever, that would be real bad. A hanging brake cable is pretty obvious. So, in any other case. There are different kinds of actuators for parking brakes across the various models. Most all use a cable to pull on a lever. So I am wondering if you are asking about the rear drum brakes when the park brake lever never gets pulled on. In most drum brake applications, the parking brake lever is separate from the self adjuster mechanism. As long as the self adjuster stays intact, the brake shoes will apply with the hydraulic force of the wheel cylinder regardless of what the parking brake lever is doing. So yeah, there is a chance. Pretty remote. I know one hell of a lot f cars driving around with good rear brakes and no parking brake. ",
