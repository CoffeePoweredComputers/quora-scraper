            "answer_text": "There's a cynical argument that says they already have. But it's simply that there are so many words, and so many different combinations and permutations of these words. Take this as a little example. Two words that are often found in songs: \u201cI\u201d and \u201clove\u201d. Now think of everything that there is a word for. There are a hell of a lot of things, yes? So you now have as many things as there are or we have words for and by putting them after those two words \u201cI\u201d and \u201clove\u201d, you have a selection (admittedly not always great) of sentences to choose from. I love (x), but girl I love you more. And right there you've got quite a few potential sentences. Potentially crap, but possible all the same. Right now you could sit down and write a sentence that no one in the history of mankind has EVER written before: \u201cThat's twice now you've called we Wyndham Jones so now you're getting fish fingers for tea - put my monkey down you glowing goddess of Guantanamo.\u201d Just that short sentence has never been written before. And there's no way it'll be written again unless somebody reads this and copies it. Consider this: there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet, but practically infinite (I know infinite is an absolute and you can't have \u201cpractically infinite\u201d) ways of combining them. There are only three prime pigment colours, red, yellow, blue. And just for the heck of it let\u2019s add black and white. So that's 5. Every other possible colour comes from mixing these colours together in various ways. So that means that every single painting or photograph - in fact every single thing - you've ever seen or ever will see is just different combinations of those three (or five including black and white - which are technically shades I guess) colours in different combinations of positions. Everything. So given 26 letters, it really takes a staggering lack of imagination that so many song lyrics sound so similar. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory, you would run out of original tunes long before words. Most vocalists sing the bulk of their words over a 1.5 -2 octave spread while there are hundreds of thousands of useable words. The number of tunes for which plagiarism suits are successful are far fewer than you would imagine. Words are only restricted by the imagination. ",
