            "answer_text": "Subjective, but in my opinion\u2026 No, either KMFDM or Ministry (not sure which one) is the best industrial metal band. Rammstein has almost none of the vocal distortion typical of industrial metal. KMFDM has a combination of metal screams/shouts, clean vocals, and vocoded robotic vocals, which I like best. I'm pretty sure Ministry has screamed and shouted vocals. KMFDM and Ministry I think are also more stylistically diverse. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I think so. Some like Ministry or Fear Factory but I think they are far away from Rammstein. Till Linderman\u2019s voice is the best in the world. Did you saw their live performances. I think Rammestein is also the best live metal band on earth. ich tu dir weh, Ich will, Sonne, Rammlied, Benzin are some of my favorite songs. ",
