            "answer_text": "You'll find a host of answers and diehard fans of various instruments that maintain a religious conviction that Paul played their favourite bass on a particular track. First, there were four basses available: his Rickenbacker 4001S, the second Hofner violin bass he'd acquired, a Fender Jazz, and a right handed Jazz as well. The tracks that feature George on bass would be that righty Fender Jazz. Some photographic evidence exists that confirms the Rickenbacker was used on Come Together. I suspect that most of Paul's bass parts (including Something) were recorded with the Rickenbacker. Some maintain the Hofner was used but given the use of notes up and down the fretboard and the consistency of both tuning and output I subscribe to the Rickenbacker as the bass on that track. Incidentally, a friend of mine who owns a vintage Rickenbacker and Hofner recorded his own versions of Something with the intention of establishing which bass was used. No definitive answer was arrived at but the Rickenbacker had the edge for the reasons I stated. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know for sure. From the articles I\u2019ve about that time period, the band members were not happy campers and barely speaking to each other. Were they interested in putting out a quality album? Yes. It had their name on it and they wanted it to keep up with the public\u2019s expectations. People loved The Beatles and they\u2019d buy Beatle albums and songs just because it had their name on it. Whether it was good or not. The Beatles put out a lot of music in a relatively short period of time and they were not all big hits but the public had developed very high expectations for The Beatles. Recording sessions at that time had evolved from they first started recording (technology had improved) and how into the music they were at that time I don\u2019t know but in the end, the finished product was a great album. Every time I saw Paul McCartney he was playing his Hofner Violin Bass. I know he played that on tour but what he played in the studio I don\u2019t know. ",
