            "answer_text": "Because Spotify is not paying \u201cbadly\u201d. If you want that artists get more money, YOU -the user- have to pay more. Now things are different, no? Spotify pays ca 70% of their income in royalties. A percentage, NOT a fixed amount pro stream. In this way you guarantee that there is no imediate risk of problems. Again: Spotify pays 70% and keeps 30%. From that, salaries, costsof other kinds, renting offices, lawyers, etc. Sure, Spotify\u2019s CEO is not starving as well. Now, how can artists get more money in the pocket? Two ways: a) Spotify pays 90% of the income and survives on the other 10%. Not realistic, but even if, the difference is just a little. b) users pay more. Not 10 dollars/month, but -say- 100 dollars. In this way, thei percentages would be the same but the amount much more. Now tell me, which user will agree on that? Juan Maria Solare ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure there are multiple reasons, but it appears the two main ones are being part of the \u201cnew wave\u201d and being deceived. By new wave I mean what appears to be the cutting edge in music, at least as measured by subscribers to the main streaming platforms. What most artists don\u2019t understand are things like how many other artists they are \u201ccompeting\u201d against, how playlists actually work to select songs (which is to say, to select artists), how much lower the quality of the audio files delivered in streaming are (vs. MP3 downloads), etc. The deception part (and that may be too strong a word) is that far too many artists do not realize that when they load up their music to be sold on internet music platforms (CD Baby, Tunecore, etc) they are agreeing to upload their music to the streaming platforms. That, in fact, appears to be where most of CD Baby and Tunecore\u2019s growth is coming from. So, you\u2019ve placed your product for sale on those platforms, and its also appearing on the streaming platforms\u2026..so where are you? As John Oszajca put it: who\u2019s going to buy your CD when it appears for free on their phone? ",
