            "answer_text": "They have a short Discography but it would be like Quality over Quantity.  If I\u2019ll give them numeric ranks out of ten (for my best 5 songs of them) then I'd say. 1. I Wanna Be Adored - 10/10 Why - Just amazing voice of Ian Brown and a different tone than other TSR songs. 2. Love Spreads - 10/10 Why - Groovy beats and the only song of them for any mood. 3. I Am the Resurrection - 9/10 Why - The masterpiece of over 8 minutes and Instrumental outro is at their best. 4. Fools Gold - 9/10 Why - Drums, rhythmic beats and for mood of dance. 5. Waterfall - 9/10 Why - Best lyrics by them ever along with Intro and Guitar riffs. ",

            "answer_text": "I usually cringe at asking a question about music this way because \u201cbest\u201d is subjective in music imho. Are you going to rate \u201cbest\u201d on \u201chow many notes?\u201d or \u201chow many chords?\u201d or \u201care there key changes?\u201d? Don't mean to be pedantic about this, but I think it's fun to discuss this as what your favorite songs are by a band, or in a genre, ever etc. That said, the correct answers are: She Bangs the DrumsI am the ResurrectionMersey ParadiseFool\u2019s GoldBreaking into HeavenMade of StoneI wanna be adoredWhy? Cuz I said so. ;-) ",
