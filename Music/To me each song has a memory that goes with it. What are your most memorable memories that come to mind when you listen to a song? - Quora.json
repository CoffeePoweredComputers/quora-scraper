            "answer_text": "I can tell you one song that gives a rather strong flashback everytime. Peppermint Rainow: Pink Lemonade That song instantly reminds me of riding a chamois yellow cab that our family occasionally took in the early 80\u2019s. Both the cab enterpreneur and his wife who drove the cab in turns, are long gone, I believe, they weren\u2019t young even back then. Well. It is strange that this song gives me this cab flashback because I heard it in a situation not at all related to the cab, the rough era aside. I heard the song after my grandpa had recently passed and we were doing the estate inventory. There was not much really. His most valuable possessions, two well kept old East-German cars, went to remote non-descendant relatives who bought them from the estate dirt cheap. The piece of heirloom I got was a mono ree-to-reel tape recorder which I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d had, and twenty-some tapes recorded mainly off the radio. We listened to those tapes through, and somehow a short excerpt of this song would haunt me for the two decades to come. I knew no English language then, but somehow, years later I mulled it over in my mind\u2026 when I\u2019m with you, one glass will do, of pink lemonade \u2026yes that must be what it said. But it was no use googling the lyrics. As a stroke of luck I found a cassette tape in 2005 or so, that was recorded from the old tape. That had been in my mom\u2019s possession all the time, buried in a buro drawer and almost forgotten. I recorded the excerpt on the computer, and emailed it to many people who I knew to be familiar with late 60\u2019s music. Kinda had to be that era, because granny said that the device had been acquired mid-60\u2019s and had been sitting abandoned in a closet for many years before I was born. Also played the file to many friends. Finally, one of my friends found a fresh republication of an old album carrying a name resembling the lyrics, only available on CD\u2026 lo and behold! That was it. Nice hippie era album, which I went to order from a record store in the city where I worked. Also it is quite odd that for many years in the early 90\u2019s I enthusiastically listened to and recorded a weekly radio show that played 60\u2019s music, but never, ever did they cover the song or even the band. Must have been quite obscure stuff at its time. ",

            "answer_text": "I have one very clear memory of a song. In about 1977 I was driving thro the NZ countryside in my 1976 911 with the top off. My girlfriend by my side and on the amazing Blaupunkt stereo was Gordon Lightfoot singing the \u201cThe Last Time\u201d. When the violin interlude came on I was overcome with emotion. A moment of pure bliss. That happened over 40 years ago and I remember it like yesterday. One of my favourite memories. ",
