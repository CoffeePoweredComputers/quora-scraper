            "answer_text": "One could consider nu metal a form of alternative metal, as alternative metal is pretty much defined as a sub genre that uses non-metal characteristics in metal songs. However generally alternative metal is used to describe bands that have more rock influences in them (e.g. Stone Sour, System of a Down, Deftones). Some may have jazz influences in them too (e.g. Animals as Leaders). Nu metal is metal that has rap influences. The genre has pretty much died out now, however some of the most famous nu metal bands were Limp Bizkit, Korn, Linkin Park, and early Slipknot. These bands blended fast rap vocals with heavy metal instrumentals to create a completely new sub genre, however this genre generally tended to lack a few metal characteristics such as guitar solos and sometimes harsh vocals.
