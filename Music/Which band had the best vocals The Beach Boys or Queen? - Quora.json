He wasn't even good enough to tie Freddie's shoes. And Mike Loves showmanship was, ah, well, there was no showmanship. He was a joke.Now as far the musicianship in each band well, the Beach Boys really didn't have any. They could play alittle,very little. But a lot of their music was done by studio musicians ( the Wrecking Crew) even their biggest hits were done by someone else. Now Queen, it's self explanatory. I've saw them twice and couldn't imagine anything better in musicianship. Now, Beach Boys could harmonize better than most but Queen harmonized great too. But Queen also used a lot of recording tricks in their harmonies. ",
