            "answer_text": "It's very well explained by previous answers. I want to answer this question from picking technique side. The rest is explained by Paul and Jay very well. My humble opinions are from example songs;  Metallica - Nothing Else Matters. Anyone can play the start but what about the rest? (needs finger picking)The Animals - House of rising sun. Classic for basic chord arpeggios try alternate picking. The Police / Sting - Every Breath You Take. So sweet open chords add2s, sus4sThe Eagles - Hotel CaliforniaRed Hot Chili Peppers - CalifornicationEric Clapton - Wonderful TonightAnd more can be found. I strongly believe that first beginners should better to find the songs that they like. It's more didactic than working triads arpeggios. Trying these arpeggios alternate picking is very important. When I start playing guitar nobody told me that the thing \"alternate picking\" so I played arpeggios  by the way I like, only problem with doing this is, my right hand (picking hand) used to do whenever he likes to picking up and down stroke. When the bpm ups, my pick started to move unnecessary open strings, which sounds not clear and no good. So it very hard thing in guitar to break a habit. It took many years still I have problems. If you start to practice \"alternate picking\" from the beginning, when you want play such arpeggios like Al di Meola did below song (on the left) Such arpeggios, can be played easily if player knows alternate picking. Especially check out the intro arpeggios, Al di Meola right hand.      ",
