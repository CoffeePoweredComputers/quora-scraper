            "answer_text": "I have noticed when ever they are a new channel they start off excellently because they have that starting of as a common man to help the common man spirit with the new anchors too have the same zeal to address issue without being biast but as we begin appreciating them they get attention of higher powers and then they turn to something they weren't when they started. Well I mean when you tackle issues you rub a lot of negative elements the wrong way and you got court cases and othet kinds of pressures now to fight them the channel sometimes seek favors from another side which leaves them to favor that side in the future. Politics is a dirty game if you have a hand in you just get your hand dirty and the media has a huge game to play in politics because what we know is what we see in the prime time news. An favorite anchor alwasy seem right. Then you have anchors who you anchors you actually adored like Barkha Dutt who I remember an neighbour of mine saying he wants his kid to be like her but now Bharkha Dutt somehow she stops being what she was starts siding and talking something you never ever imagined. What went wrong was not Able to handle the success and fame which led to ego and she felt now she is not a common man anymore and there the connection with us was cut. What she says only she understands an she expects us to understand like before when she made sense. Then they get content greedy and try to grab common issues and turn and twist it to make it a \u201cBreaking news\u201d. As far as I remember was the first time I heard and saw the term breaking news flashing on screen was when Princess Diana died then almost everyday I saw that term on a news channel. So much the media killed the term that when the twin tower collapse happened I saw breaking news flashing on the screen first and changed the channel and it hit me suddenly something huge was happning in the background and I came back to the channel. I feel when they start off as a young channel and begin to waver with the sudden power with surplus money flowing with ads and other sources. Once they waver its hard to get back to the same path they started on. ",

            "answer_text": " Do you Remember the picture? The name of the picture was \"The vulture & the little girl. In the picture, a vulture is waiting for the death of a hungry little girl. Kevin Carter, a South African photojournalist, captured the March 1993 famine in Sudan. He was awarded the \"Pulitzer Prize\" for the film. But Katar committed suicide at the age of 33, despite receiving so much respect. But what was the reason for suicide? In fact, when he was busy celebrating such a great honor at the time, the news of his receiving the award was being shown on various TV channels, at that time someone asked in a phone interview what happened to the girl in the end? Carter replied that he could not say because he was in a hurry to catch his flight. \"How many vultures were there?\" He asked again. \"I think there was one,\" Carter said. The man on the other end of the phone said, \"I'm saying there were two vultures that day, one of them with a camera.\" Realizing the significance of these words, Carter became upset and eventually committed suicide. It should be humane to get anything in any situation. Carter would be alive today if he had taken the starving baby to the United Mission's feeding center, which was only 1/2 mile away, where the baby might have been trying to reach. Today, 26 years later, the vultures are still returning home from all over India with cameras in their hands, busy taking pictures of workers walking thousands of kilometers. There is no holding even after seeing the children. These vultures are more concerned with gathering news, with increasing channel TRP, than with worrying about workers' deaths. They are busy collecting breaking news by pouring spices on the bodies of dead workers and children. Kevin Carter had self-esteem, so he committed suicide. But the vultures named after this journalist are busy making breaking news with dignity. So are the politicians wherein poor are deprived and rich are taxed and nobody interested in middle class. ",
