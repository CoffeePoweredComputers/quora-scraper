            "answer_text": "There are a few reasons I can think of for why Eric is one of the greatest and most influential guitar players of all-time. First of all, EC, during his time, was an innovator within the rock guitar circles, together with his contemporary, i.e. the late great Jimi Hendrix. He was one of the first guitar players that introduced the template for the rock guitar sound, i.e. a combination of the Gibson Les Paul and the Marshall amps that was present in the John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers album. It was thick, warm and deep, and not to mention that it enabled him to sustain notes longer than he could - this was significant since later on it would become the blueprint from which rock music later evolved to be. Check out this video of Double Crossin\u2019 Time, one of the slow blues tracks in the Bluesbreakers album, where Eric\u2019s sustain, coupled with that great vibrato of his, was absolutely incredible for his time (solo starting from 1:09):  Secondly, sure many players can out-shred Eric today as we see tons of guitarists from either the blues or rock genres capable of virtuosic playing nowadays, but he was one of those who basically started it all. Eric possesses one of the best finger vibratos in the business, and not to mention that he has an extremely great ear for bends, a skill that he has developed being a blues-based player throughout his life. This ultimately contributes to his highly distinctive tone, and majority of Eric\u2019s playing is in his fingers, not relying a lot on his gear - signs of a highly musical guitarist with an impeccable touch. EC\u2019s sense of phrasing is also incredible, and he knows how to improvise a great guitar solo live night after night, with a fantastic beginning coupled by a great climax. Even when he plays faster lines, he never loses control within his phrasing, as demonstrated by this video of him covering Five Long Years by Buddy Guy:  Bottom line, based on these details alone, I consider Eric to be one of the greatest guitar players to have ever lived, having inspired millions of axeslingers around the world to pick up the instrument.

            "answer_text": "Eric Clapton is a great guitarist for several reasons, and maybe not the reasons you might expect. He's an innovator: Clapton learned the blues from recordings of great (African) American blues musicians, who were innovators and phenomenal guitarists in their own right. He also played with some of the best blues musicians in England at the time, when he played with John Mayall's Blues Breakers. But then he went on to transmute these ingredients into rock music. His work with Cream is a great example of how Clapton took the blues form and updated it and turned it into something new. He's not the only musician who's done this, but he's one of the originals that did it incredibly well. Also, Clapton experimented with his instrument and his tone. If you play electric guitar, you may have noticed that the G string (3rd lightest string) is a plain, or unwound string, whereas on acoustic guitars, the G string is wound. Clapton was the first person to set up his guitar with an unwound G string -- he used a banjo string to replace the wound G string that came in the set. This made the G string easier to bend, and it was such a good idea that it rapidly became the standard for electric guitar strings.He can play both fast and slow: when he was playing with Cream, he demonstrated that he could play blindingly fast, but also could play slow and soulfully, like BB King. There are many guitarists who can play faster than Clapton, especially in metal, but there are few that can play as slow as he can, and still sound so good.His solos are incredibly well structured and build over time. A good guitar solo is more than a collection of licks: it has a shape and tells a story. Clapton's solos often start slow, and soft, and low on the neck, and then he builds up to a stunning climax, often fast and louder and high up on the neck. Perhaps one of the best examples of this is his solo for \"Sunshine of Your Love,\" where he starts with some tasty simple bends and then builds up to his lightning fast runs. Listen carefully to how he builds his solos over time, and try to incorporate some of that into your own playing.The thing to remember is that if you listen to Clapton's guitar playing now, you might think, \"what's the big deal, he sounds like everyone else, and he's not even that fast / doesn't use the whammy bar / doesn't play behind his head. How can he be that good?\" The answer is of course that Clapton's playing has inspired and informed hundreds of thousands of guitarists, who all sound like him, not the other way around. Clapton was one of the first in many ways to introduce the sounds, licks and styles that ultimately defined what we think of as rock guitar. He's also spawned more imitators than all but a few other guitarists. But if you are just hearing his music for the first time now, you may not understand what an innovative guitarist he was when he first appeared in the London music scene in the 1960's. ",
