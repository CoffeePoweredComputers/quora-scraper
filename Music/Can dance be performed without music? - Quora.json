            "answer_text": "You can dance without music. It may cause the audience to pay especially close attention. It is very difficult to dance without music or to music with a different speed and rhythm. It becomes more difficult when you have multiple dancers who need to stay in sync. Music is an easy cue. In its absence, dancers rely on visual cues, internal count, being able to hear breathing, and external audio cues like stomping. ",
