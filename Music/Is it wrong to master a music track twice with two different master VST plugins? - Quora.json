            "answer_text": "If you are asking this question, I suspect that you may have \u201covercooked\u201d the \u201cfinal mix\u201d before you started mastering. You are probably unable to get the track to sound \u201calive\u201d. The reason? The final mix of track is probably already way too compressed. Now it\u2019s time to go back to your mix and \u201cdecompress\u201d! Mastering typically occurs after the final mix. The final mix should not be compressed as a whole (Use subtle compression only on the tracks that need it for transient and/or level control). The rest of the basic sound should be achieved (track by track) using subtle wide band EQ boosts and a minimum of drastic narrow cuts (But if a track needs it, by all means do it!). Then when you\u2019re ready to submit the final mix for mastering, it should have been mixed to have as wide of a dynamic range as possible. I cannot stress this more. Having a wide dynamic range is the \u201clife\u201d of the music. If you have mixed as described above, then look at your waveform and it appears to be all the same (high) level throughout, you need to examine it to see what you can do to increase the dynamics. Some tracks I\u2019ve worked on were already overly dense with no compression whatsoever! The way all the \u201cpieces\u201d fit together, there was just always something loud going on. No reprieves. The composition was simply way too busy. If you see this situation, you may want to automate the volume on a track that is already \u201ctoo dense\u201d by itself\u2026 For example a rhythm guitar part with a fair amount of overdrive/distortion that plays continuously from beginning to end. If you dunk the volume of one like a little that during vocals, leads,etc. you may be able to hear (and see) a great improvement. You may even want to leave the bass and drums \u201cnaked\u201d for a few short periods. Listen to a variety of well produced music in almost any genre and you see examples of this. \u201cNaked\u201d is a good way to describe this. Sometimes, so naked, a section might seem a bit \u201cclunky\u201d or amateurish. This is OK. Most listeners will often mentally fill in the missing bits. Even though it\u2019s not there, if they\u2019ve heard it earlier in the song they\u2019ll hear it in their heads. Sure it sounds nuts, but how often have you figured out a song only to realize it was much simpler than you thought it was? Music is not only what is actually played, but also what the listener brings to the party. So yes, there is much more psychology in music than you might want to think. Now that you know, play that too! This is often what separates a good song from a great one. The magical missing ingredient. Think of dynamics as a flow of \u201cpower\u201d. When you have a song, \u201cthe power\u201d should ebb and flow. This gives it more excitement. If it\u2019s 100% \u201cfull on\u201d from start to finish, it\u2019s less musical and exciting\u2026 And more like being assaulted. Trust me on this. As a hard rock musician I want my songs to be loud, \u201cin your face\u201d, and somewhat assaulting. The point is, without any soft parts, the parts that should be loud cannot have nearly as much impact and seem really loud. During mastering, there will be many subtle EQ adjustments, some de-essing, and just the right amount of compression. A great Mastering Engineer can do this with their ears, and get a result that meets all the \u201cofficial\u201d criteria (LUFS level, dynamic range, etc.), without even needing to look at their meters (But they do look anyway, just to technically confirm what their ears already told them.). Will they run this mastered version through again? NO! ",

            "answer_text": "There are no rules in music production - no right and wrong. Just better and worse sounding outcomes\u2026 It is possible that a chain of mastering plugins will get a good sound just as there are some types of food that come out well after having been cooked twice. It\u2019s an unusual choice though. I usually find that using a lot of processing on audio gives worse results than a more minimal approach. ",
