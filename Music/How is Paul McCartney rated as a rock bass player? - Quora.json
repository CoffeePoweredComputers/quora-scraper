            "answer_text": "The Beatles is, arguably, the greatest band in the history of popular music. They innovated like no one else did, wrote highly memorable songs, and locked together as a band. A lot of that comes down to McCartney. However, I\u2019ve hung with bass players for getting on for 40 years, and I\u2019ve never once heard someone say \u2018McCartney was such a great bass player\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m practising so I can be more like McCartney\u2019. Bass players talk about James Jamerson, Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, Flea, Sting and Roger Waters. But maybe McCartney was the greatest of them all because you don\u2019t notice him. The sound The Beatles created was the sound of a band driven by its bass-drums combination. That didn\u2019t really happen before. If you listen to the kind of recordings from before The Beatles, the big sound came from horn sections, not from bass. This is partly because bass guitar never really took off until the 1950s, and people were still largely playing it like jazz acoustic bass. Bass Player Magazine rates him at number 3. The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time This is more because of influence than because of his absolute abilities as a musician, but it\u2019s a fair rating. ",

            "answer_text": "Paul is one of the most respected Bass players in the history of rock. While there are better bassist out there he changed the way that the bass was used in rock music and has made being a bass player cool. Before Paul the bass was looked at as a background instrument more than anything else and Paul used it as you would a regular guitar creating bass lines than both stood out and were incredibly melodic. I think he is looked upon as a revolutionary bassist and he inspired so many people to want to play bass. Is he the greatest bass player in the world? No he isn\u2019t but he was possibly the most important one. You have to remember that Paul didn\u2019t start out as a bass player but became one out of necessity. He is actually a very good guitarist and can play drums and piano very well too. He is a very good all around musician that plays many instruments at a professional level. He will always be rated as one of the most influential bassist of all time. ",
