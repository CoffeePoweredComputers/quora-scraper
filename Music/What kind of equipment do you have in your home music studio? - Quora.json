            "answer_text": "I have an analog studio. So, we have a huge assortment of reel-to-reel tape machines from Studer, Ampex, Scully, Tascam, TEAC plus consumer decks. No room for a big console, but we do have a Yamaha and a couple of small, project mixers (an old Sony, a cheap but fun Sanyo and Mackie). Microphones: the typical variety of Shures for vocals, instruments, drums; several Neumanns\u2014mostly U87s, AKG 414s for vocals, a couple of Chinese condensers (cheap but sound good), PZM (another cheap but useful), then there are misc. others we seldom use. Outboard gear galore: Pultec Eq, a couple of Lexicon pieces, including an old Super Prime Time (LOL), my mind is going blank now\u2026.ummm. Several amps including a really boat anchor from Yamaha that I love. We have KRK, Urei and Yam NS10s for monitors/speakers. What am I leaving out? (I\u2019m old and have a bad memory). We have a Yamaha baby grand (I think it is a C series) Very little guitar equipment/amps etc. I have Pro Tools, but it is a very, very old edition and I just couldn\u2019t stand using it. A couple of keyboards, including a classic Yamaha DX-7, the first one, brown, big and heavy; great controller. Putting the DX up for sale, along with a Fender J bass. Keeping the Paul Reed Smith guitars. An old, but wonderful bid ol\u2019 1964 Gibson acoustic guitar. Quite frankly, I have been sick for a couple of years and only my husband has used the studio. We have lots of outdated stuff like DAT recorders, CD players, great Tascam cassette recorders. I still wish I could remember the outboard gear\u2026 sounds like I need to put on my knee braces and amble down the stairs and go check out the studio! When I can\u2019t remember what I have, it\u2019s past due a visit! Thanks for the question, it motivated me! P.S. My husband is an audio tech and he brings home orphaned stuff all the time, particularly reel to reel machines! www.shustersound.com ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m on a tight budget and acquire gear as I can. It\u2019s been a slow process and as much as I would love to hold out and save for those expensive drool worthy pieces, it\u2019s just not in me to be patient lol. I has a 2010 Mac Pro Dual CPU 24 core, 32gb machine w/ a pair of 1tb drives and a pair of 512gb Solid State drives, external 1tb Firewire drive (to record to), Presonus Faderport 8 control surface, Event TR6 Near field Monitors, M-Audio Oxygen49 Midi keyboard controller, My rack consists of a Furman Power supply, a dbx 2 channel compressor/limiter, ART 6 channel headphone amp and the following Behringer gear..48 point Patchbay, dual 31 Band EQ, 2 Channel Tube Preamp and a UMC1820 18in/20out (8 preamps) Audio Interface. Amps I have are a Bugera TriRec 100w head, Egnater Tweaker 15w head, cabs - 1x12 (Egnater), 4x12 & 2x12 (Marshall), an Ibanez 4string Bass, Ibanez RG series Strat type guitar, Epiphone Les Paul Standard, Gibson Les Paul Studio & a Gibson Les Paul Classic Gold Top, Kramer Striker Guitar, 2 elec/acoustic guitars, Alesis Surge Electronic Drum Kit, too many mics to list both Condenser and Cardioid, boom stands, shock mounts, tons and tons of cables\u2026The room is treated with 2\u201d foam wedges, multiple 3\u201d & 4\u201d panels, base traps and deflectors. I think that about covers it. Although I\u2019m sure I missed something. Ahh oh yeah I forgot..I have a Roberts 4 track reel to reel and matching external extension speakers. This item is more of a decoration now. It\u2019s from the \u201850\u2019s and belong to my father. It\u2019s a tube model that still works and I just couldn\u2019t throw it away or sell it when I inherited it. ",

            "answer_text": "My space is 16\u2032 x 23\u2032 with cathedral ceiling peaking at 14\u2032. That\u2019s pretty close to a golden mean. It is a standalone building about 40 feet from the main house. It is built out of cinderblocks, filled with sand for soundproofing mass and covered in stucco, for aesthetics. That\u2019s not enough room for a two decent sized control and tracking rooms, but I do so much recording by myself, so it makes more sense to have one big room. I mention this, because i consider my room to be my main advantage in recording. I have DIY acoustic treatments, using shrouded sheets of OC703, offset from the wall a couple inches and massed in the corners about 4\u2033 thick across the diagonals with voids filled with fiberglass scraps. I have a number of resonant panel bass traps as well, so the room isn\u2019t too dead. There are two very large picture windows (one facing a beautiful river), with very heavy curtains, if I need to reduce reflections off glass. My mic locker has a Neuman U-89 Condensor mic and two Peluso P12 Condensor mics (well regarded clones of the AKG C-12 classic). I have a few other dynamic and condensor mics, but the Neuman and Pelusos are the cream. I have three channels of DIY Seventh Circle Audio Preamps. Two are clones of API 512s and one is a clone of the Neve 1272. I also have a Demeter tube preamp. So, I have five channels of boutique preamp. I have a Klark Teknik LA2A optical compressor clone and a Klark Teknik Pultec EQ clone. I normally track vocals through the compressor (lightly) and maybe through the EQ. These feed into my AD converter, which is an Apogee Symphony I/O, that connects to my Apple MacBook Pro and feeds an array of speakers, including a pair of DynAudio BM-15s. I use MOTU Digital Performer software as my DAW and use Native Instruments Komplete and Arturia Classic Synthesizer plugins. Those two cover a huge array of keyboard and percussion options. I have lots of guitars, basses, amplifiers, drums, etc\u2026 I feel very fortunate to have all this. ",
