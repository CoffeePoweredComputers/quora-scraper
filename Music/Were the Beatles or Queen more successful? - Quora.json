            "answer_text": "It is very telling how the 20th Century is retreating from memory. The recent Freddie Mercury/Queen biopic has whetted many appetites for all things Queen. The biopic was highly successful and did give the impression that Queen was a huge band back then. Although they were a very popular band they were not the preeminent band of the 1970\u2019s or 1980\u2019s. They had extraordinary competition in a huge array of bands covering various sub-genres of rock. But they were not as big as many now would have you think. It is very difficult to convey to millennials how huge the Beatles were not just in the era of their existence as a recording band but in subsequent decades. The Beatles had an omnipotent presence in the 1960\u2019s and all other artists were in awe of them. They not only outsold all contenders they produced quality music from start to finish. The mindset of younger people today is different to that of older people. They have shorter attention spans due to the overload of information streaming in. If a movie takes their fancy it dominates their thinking. Older people know exactly where these bands fit in the scheme of things. Younger people were not there so can\u2019t be expected to know. A clever band can create an image for itself through careful advertising and well-constructed biopics or documentaries. I\u2019m sure that bands such as Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd could create biopics that would convince younger people that they ruled the roost back then too. And so could a number of other successful bands. In many online lists of the greatest bands of the 1970\u2019s Queen don\u2019t even make the Top 20. If you disbelieve me, Google \u201clist of greatest bands of the 1970\u2019s\u201d and you will soon see how it actually was back then. So, the answer to this is very straight forward. The Beatles were more successful and more influential and more artistically gifted than Queen by an extraordinary margin. That is not to run Queen down. They were a great band in the earlier part of their career. But by the 1980\u2032s they had become what we used to call MOR (Middle of the Road). The Beatles were never MOR. No other band in history comes close to the Beatles and it looks as if none in the future ever will either. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Were the Beatles or Queen more successful?\" This all depends how you measure success. The Beatles were much more successful during the period they were active. Queen never came close to that level of dominance. The Beatles were hip/cool/trendy/whatever and Queen never were. Queen were very popular and sold a good amount of records, but many people thought of them as a guilty pleasure. They were never cool (until now). However, you could argue Queen were more successful because they stayed together as long as life allowed and they have spent more time in the (UK) charts than any other act. They're also the most successful band from the '70s in terms of downloads. It all depends upon your definition of success. You can normally assign anything you want to number one status by being specific with your criteria. You could also argue that Queen were more successful than The Beatles at having the letter \"q\" in their band name. By most sensible metrics The Beatles are number one by a considerable margin. I think this question would have been better to have asked for a comparison between The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. The answer would still be The Beatles though. ",
