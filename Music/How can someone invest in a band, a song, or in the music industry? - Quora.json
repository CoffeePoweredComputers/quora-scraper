            "answer_text": "The Simplest and easiest way is to help fund music-related projects on Kickstarter or Indiegogo. You will get a return on your investment depending on how much you invest and what the rewards are. --> Kickstarter: Music Projects / Indiegogo: Explore: Music UPDATE:I  know that Music Festivals require capital investment similar to  start-ups. They have a huge upfront cost of booking acts, venues, staff  and equipment, which is why upfront investment is required. That seems  like your safest bet investment-wise. Investment in Artists is historically done via labels. Bands  will create a \"demo\" or rough cut of a few songs on their new album,  then they will shop it around to different labels. Labels can make them offers,  and the artist can choose which offer and label fits best. (Alternatively, a band could be scouted by an A&R representative of a label and directly given an offer). A label can give the band an \"advance\" payment (almost like a salary)  and also pays for all the costs associated with recording their album  and sometimes their tour. The band is then contractually obligated to  return a large percentage of the money they receive through album sales  (and sometimes tour and merchandise sales, depending on the agreement)  to the label until the label recoups their investment. After that point  is reached, the label continues to take a percentage (their \"profit\").  This  is a very risky investment in today's music market. It's easiest to  compare labels to VC firms and bands to startups. 9 out of 10 bands will  bust, but that 1 out of 10 band that becomes a mega hit is where the label  will make their money, so they typically diversify their investment over  a large number and variety of artists. Historically,  the label executives were quite evil and not friendly to the artists,  getting bands at an early level to sign their lives away in  all-encompassing contracts. Much can be read on the internet about this.  This led to the emergence of many independent (\"Indie\") labels which  offered less evil, more artist-friendly contract terms. Now that  everything is digital, I feel like contracts are much different. I see  and hear from bands that many labels today are only doing one-album  contracts. Hopefully this helps a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think there's many labels out there which are open for public trade. And while you could technically open up a label yourself, unless you also have time to spend, you'll find an average of 0.648 bands willing to take your money instead of just asking for a bank loan themselves. Honestly, there's almost no money to be done in music; it's a almost always a work of passion for those involved (not to say that professionals will NOT ask for a fair price for their work, just that they cannot bargain as much as they'd want). While the Internet has made it easier for the bands to get in touch directly with fans willing to support them if they do good music, profits are still pretty low for the long time invested. ",
