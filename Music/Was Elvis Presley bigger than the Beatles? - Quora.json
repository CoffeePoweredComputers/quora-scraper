            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s just stick to facts.. 1 out of every 3 records sold in the U.S. in 1977 was an Elvis record. If soundscan had been around, Elvis would have had no less than 40 albums on the hot 100 at the same time. The Beatles haven\u2019t even come close to that. At no other time in music history in western culture did the sale of guitars ever explode or increase as they did when Elvis burst onto the scene. On Elvis\u2019 records was where his guitarist, Scotty Moore, invented rock and roll guitar. Anyone who can read sheet music knows that Moore initiated the technique known as \u201cpower chording\u201d. It\u2019s an alternate chord figure that goes with everything. It\u2019s mostly used by heavy metal and Punk Rock guitar. When Elvis released his first album 85 percent of record players sold were only capable of playing 45\u2019s or Eps. By his fourth album, this almost completely flipped to where they were now selling more players that could play albums too. Elvis was the number one artist on the charts in 50\u2019s, no.2 in the 60\u2019s, no 9 in the 70\u2019s The following people became musicians because of Elvis\u2026McCartney, Lennon, Ringo, Harrison(was a musician but changed his goal to rock after hearing Elvis), Buddy Holly (was a musician but changed from country to rock after seeing Elvis on the Lousiana hayride in Lubbock) Elton John was classically trained but changed rock) Mick Fleetwood, Jimmy Page, All The Beach Boys, Keith Richards, Rod Stewart, Roger Daltry, Robert Plant, Steven Tyler, Klaus Meine(Scorpions lead vocalist)Ronnie Milsap, Bob Dylan, Tom Jones, Hendrix (mom took him to an Elvis concert when he was young that\u2019s when he decided to play music) Brian Setzer of The Stray Cats, Glen Campbell\u2026 that\u2019s just to name a few Elvis has sold more than 1 billion records worldwide as announced by his record company. (Point of contention for Beatles fans) They can not find one official announcement by their record company stating The Beatles have sold 1 billion records and according to McCartney and I quote \u201cIf The Beatles have sold a billion records then somebody owes me the other half of my royalties.\u201d Jackie Wilson, \u201cNobody can sing blues better than Elvis\u201d. Brian Setzer, \u201cEverything in popular music is a tribute to Elvis\u201d Carl Perkins, \u201cEveryone has their own ideas about what rock is. But make no mistake, The first time anyone ever did what was called rock-a-billy was when Elvis, Scotty and the boys started recording\u201d Roy Orbison, \u201cElvis was the firstest with the mostest\u201d\u2026 Dick Clark, \u201cI know he didn\u2019t write the songs but there isn\u2019t anybody or act in rock and roll history that was more influential than Elvis\u201d ca.1990 \u201cThere are some songs only Elvis could sing\u201d Dick Clark, ca. 1987 Lennon, \u201cBefore Elvis there was nothing\u201d Bob Dylan, \u201cI don\u2019t look at myself as a \u2018poetic genius\u2019 \u2018voice of a generation\u201d or anything like that, I just want to be Elvis\u201d\u2026.as told to Ed Bradley of 60 minutes around 1997 Bobby Womack black performer and producer, \u201cElvis sent a shockwave through the black community like nobody I have ever heard before. Now that\u2019s power\u201d B.B.King, \u201cElvis had an influence on all of us. They didn\u2019t make a mistake when they called him the king\u201d Little Richard, \u201cAbout every 1000 years God sends the world a messiah, Elvis was ours\u201d Lenny Kaye (lead guitarist for the Patty Smith Group and a musicologist) \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen very often that you can go to Mount Olympus to see a performance. Elvis functioned as a God\u201d\u2026.his review of going to Elvis at Madison Square Gardens concert. Glen Campbel, \u201cElvis is the best singer that ever lived\u201d Writer of Mary in The Morning, \u201cI think Elvis was the best singer ever\u201d Kiri Te Kanawa highly respected opera singer in 2014, \u201cElvis in his 20\u2019s was the best singer that I ever heard\u201d Trisha Yearwood, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be pretty bold to try and take on an Elvis vocal performance\u201d Comedian Eddie Murphy, \u201cRichard Pryor and Elvis were the biggest influences on me. I just thought they were the coolest people ever\u201d Tom Jones, \u201cElvis made a song different simply by the way he sang it\u201d Dennis Miller, \u2018The jury has been out on the who was bigger Elvis or The Beatles a long time ago. You don't see a need for thousands of Beatles impersonators worldwide do you?\u2019 Elvis hit a level in cultural and music history that was so high he simply cannot be assessed in terms of popularity. This isn\u2019t debatable. Elvis was by far more influential than anyone before or after. I put a range of music people as to what they said about Elvis to make the point. There\u2019s Elvis and then there\u2019s everybody else\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Elvis Presley was bigger than the Beetles and even they felt it when they met him in 1964 at his home as they were so nervous in meeting him. Elvis is the greatest of all time. The beetles were great till 1966 when Paul McCartney died in a car crash. The existing Paul is a duplicate lookalike with a nice voice but he cannot be the original. He cannot reach the high tones like the original Paul McCartney. The duplicate admitted it on an interview a few years ago and then laughed about it as if he was joking. Anyway I was a child of 12 years old when Elvis died in 1977 and I cried like a baby. I had his records and loved him. The Beetles did not touch on him. I liked their songs but never listen to them and never really did unless they came on radio or tv or when out. I listen to Elvis songs even now every few days. I miss him. Elvis had to fake his death in 1977 cos he had the mafia and the Panthers out to kill him and I am so happy he is alive now still at 83 years old but I do miss him at the top. Elvis still releases songs every year but no-one realises cos they listen to the media who tell us what they want us to hear. See Knights of the Kings Realm on youtube. There are people in high places that sensor what goes out to the media. I love Elvis and hope he is happy. I know he misses not being on top from listening to the youtube videos on him and he has done interviews on youtube with 2012 being his last interview where he answered the questions on his fake death and why. You may not believe me but please don\u2019t take my word for it. Go on youtube and find out the truth yourself. I am just happy Elvis is still alive and I wish him the best. The Beetles are nothing in front of him. That is my view. Michael Jackson was great but nothing beats Elvis. Look at the Elvis duplicates and fans and clubs that exist today for Elvis Presley after his supposed death in 1977 wich is 51 years ago He was supposed to have died at 42 years old of drugs - nonsence. He put on weight himself to fake his death to look like a terminally ill patient that looked just like him for his death. Elvis is slim all his life till the last 6 months or so of his life to match the terminally ill patient who would be used to fake his death.I am listening to Elvis Presley songs now on youtube. I love all his songs. I need to listen to his new songs that he releases every year. I reckon he has decided not to come out and tell the world. His decision. But let us see. You never know. ",
