            "answer_text": "You could also upload all your music to google drive, if you have the $$$. There are many advantages to this, like that you will keep all your tagged info intact, and you can upload your music in any format you like (like FLAC), and KEEP IT THAT WAY. Remember that Google Play Music converts all your FLAC tracks to 320 kbps MP3, Google Drive doesn\u2019t. Another solution would be to use a media player that is also a server like Helium or MediaMonkey. You can also play it over the internet and while you\u2019re away. Helium even has an android app for this. But you need to have all your music on your PC, and your computer must be on, connected to the internet, and have a decent upload speed for this to work. Basically you\u2019re turning your computer into a private internet-based music streaming server. Pros: it\u2019s like having your own streaming service. Cons: you need a decent upload speed (10mbps min), and it\u2019s great if you don\u2019t have a really big collection of music. OR\u2026. you could make your own cloud server with \u2714 ownCloud - The last cloud collaboration platform you'll ever need. That is, if you are a little technical, and have a dedicated computer that can act as a 24/7 server. Pros: it\u2019s having your own private cloud. Not only works for music, but any file, even movies, as long as you have them available on your server. Cons: requires some computer skills and patience. Also requires being on 24/7 and keeping all the stuff you want to stream online on hard drive(s). It\u2019s great if you don\u2019t have multiple-terabyte music or movie collections. If you do, it can get expensive having to buy hard disks to keep all the stuff available 24/7. ",

            "answer_text": "Update: YouTube Music now allows this. This is a great question. I'm not sure, to be completely honest. You can use Google Drive to upload your music and download them to your device to listen on the go. I hear Spotify has a similar feature, but I've never used it. MEGA offers 50 GB of cloud storage for free, so that's plenty for music, if you want to use that. As far as actually music streaming services with that same upload feature, I've not heard of any other. ",
