            "answer_text": "Try to learn the song by ear. Whatever tuning allows the least effort from the fretting hand is most likely the one it was written in. Listen for the lowest single-string note, and whether its fretted, or an open string. If you cant produce it, your tuning is too high. If it's an open string, you're in luck. Detune your bottom string until it matches, then adjust your other strings to normal tuning relative to you bottom string. If its fretted, it could be harder to figure out. If you find that you have to play the rhythm part particularly high on the fretboard, then you're likely tuned too low. Uptune until you can comfortably play the rhythm section. Dont forget drop tunings. Many newerish rock and metal songs use these to play power chords with one finger. Open tunings and capos are a whole other monster. Figuring those out will require fairly well-trained ear. Though, at that point, you're able to play by ear easily to begin with. Mostly, though, you're going to find guitars are in E Standard. Start from there. Guitarists tend to play all their songs in the same tuning, with a few exceptions. Learn the fretboard. Not necessarily the names of the notes, but the sound of each fret on each string. Pick out a random fret and string. Play it, then play the notes around it. Play them separately and together. Listen to how they interact. It's a long road, but well worth the journey. ",

For melody it has a range of 3 to almost 4 octaves If you are choosing. a key, you either use the one most comfortable for the singer , or one which \u201c sits\u201d comfortably on the neck regarding melody chords and bass notes. You will find E A D G C used a lot for solo self contained stuff. Flat keys such as Bb Eb Ab Db are often chosen to accommodate players of sax trumpet etc ",
