            "answer_text": "I have a few songs to name. I would have to say the very first song that brought about sorrow that I could no longer listen to is The Everlasting Gaze by The Smashing Pumpkins. I remember hanging out with a friend of mine and listening to this song. It was late on a school night for me and I remember laying on his bed and I the thing that stands out the most of this memory is the light blue paint of his bedroom walls. This friend of mine ended up committing suicide. He suffered from psychological issues from abusing Methamphetamine and was Diagnosed Paranoid Schizophrenic. He managed to overcome that and went on to join the United States Marines. He was deployed to Afghanistan and I only know that he engaged in combat, he never spoke of the details. He was only back home for about a year or less when he shot himself in the front lawn of his mothers home. He suffered very much from depression and was deeply disenchanted with life. This used to be one of my favorite songs by the group and now I can no longer listen to it. I had first met my friend when I was in middle school. He was an adult and I was friends with his younger brothers who were my age. I remember I had looked up to him when I was that age, whenever I found myself in certain situations I would ask myself, \u201cWhat would Gerald do?\u201d At that time, he didn\u2019t hang out with us, we were just kids but when I became an adult, we became friends. He influenced me in many ways. The rest of these I can no longer listen to because of the person that broke my heart and deeply wounded me. Bad Intentions by Niykee Heaton. Although this was not a song I liked, I would not want to hear it if it came on. She came over one day and played this song, she was sending me a message. The rest of these are: Say It by Tory Lanez, Exchange by Bryson Tiller and Oui by Jeremih. There is actually one more and it\u2019s a guilty pleasure of mine. Company by Justin Beiber. This song I did like but I can no longer listen to. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. During the last couple of months before my brothers untimely death, the last song we heard together in the car was The Dream - I Luv Your Girl. We were on the interstate, and riding back from my parents new house several miles away from the house we both grew up in. He had drove a 1992 Nissan 350z coupe, and it struggled a lot of times to get from point A to point B. It was a good looking car, and I can smell the old suede seats, see the ripped leather, and his air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror.   I have a hard time listening to this song, because its recent. I discovered African pop musician Davido a little over a year ago because of Apple Music. At work, during a special event working for the YMCA, I had been paired with Estefania. Estefania was a voluptuous latina from Panama who had been in the United States no longer than 5 years. She still had her accent, and whenever she spoke, it sounded like music to my ears. To describe it, she sounded like Sofia Vergara whenever she spoke. Her body was a perfect figure; she was 5\u20325, 140 pounds, and have a thick barbie doll figure. I was instantly attracted to her when I shook hands with her to introduce myself. We went through the work day, and as we went on to talk about music, I told her I enjoyed listening to Davido. The same night, she told me he was in town performing in Washington, DC. She invited me, and I took it as an offer of her courting me. I was wrong, and we went as friends. I was thoroughly disappointed with myself because I feel like I allowed her to slip away. I cut her off completely, because she started to see me as a friend. She even suggested I move in with her as a roommate (f\u2014 no!). Because of my interaction with her, I have a hard time listening to one of my favorite song without thinking of her.  ",
