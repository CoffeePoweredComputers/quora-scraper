            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t. YouTube doesn\u2019t pay ANYTHING for a video. It\u2019s a free service, funded by advertising. People post videos they want to share, and YouTube makes its money for hosting them through advertising revenue. It baffles me why this misunderstanding seems to be growing in popularity (that somehow YouTube is a place to make money by posting videos). That is simply not how it works. Nobody gets paid for creating or posting a video on YouTube. I produce videos for non-profit organizations both in my regular job and to supplement my income, and in the latter, the client contracts with me to produce that video. That\u2019s how I get paid for it. Posting it to YouTube is just a means for sharing it with a wider audience (if they so choose). If you\u2019ve heard about people \u201cmaking money on YouTube,\u201d they\u2019re talking about something entirely different: Monetization: YouTube DOES allow monetization through AdSense. Essentially what\u2019s happening there is YouTube is agreeing to share a tiny portion of the advertising revenue you generate from your video with you. To participate, you have to become a YouTube Partner (in which you sign up for a Google AdSense account and enable monetization on your channel), [1] and there\u2019s a review process and a set of criteria you have to meet and policies you have to agree to in order to do so. Then you decide which videos on your channel you want to monetize and which types of ads you\u2019ll permit them to run. If any of your videos include content from others and you don\u2019t explicitly have permission from the copyright holder, you cannot monetize. Also, you cannot monetize any videos that violate YouTube\u2019s policies.[2]Sponsorships: Many popular YouTubers (like Rhett & Link, Ryan Higa, PewDiePie, etc.) make money with sponsorships (i.e., corporate sponsors who choose to leverage their popularity by providing cash, products, or gifts-in-kind for the YouTube stars to promote their product/s in their videos).[3]That promotion comes in a variety of ways, from what shirt they\u2019re wearing to what they say to what products get used or mentioned in the video, including what they feature in \u201cunboxing\u201d videos and the like. And yes, there\u2019s big money in this for those who have a big client base (subscribers) to share with.Be warned, though: The ONLY people making lots of money on YouTube are popular channel owners who have hundreds of thousands of subscribers (in many cases, millions) and who regularly produce extremely popular (i.e., 10\u2019s of 1000\u2019s) of views or go viral and who also have multiple sponsorships. In those cases, it can be enough to either supplement a job, or in a few cases, make a living doing it. But that isn\u2019t even in the realm of possibility for the vast majority (95%) of YouTubers. You\u2019ll know you\u2019ve reached this upper echelon of profitmaking on YouTube when corporations start contacting you to see if you\u2019d be willing to feature their products. For a more realistic scenario: I\u2019ve been on YouTube since 2007 (it started in 2005, so I was a fairly early adopter), I have 5 channels (2 personal and 3 for non-profit org\u2019s whose videos I produce or manage), and I\u2019ve monetized 3 of my channels (with about 2/3 of the videos eligible for monetization). I\u2019m not virally popular, and I don\u2019t have tons of subscribers, but I do have at least a dozen videos with several thousand views each, 3 with 5\u201310,000 views apiece, and one with 41,000 views. I\u2019ve been monetizing for the last 6 months. I checked my AdSense account yesterday, and so far I\u2019ve made a whole $7.36 (not even enough to clear the threshold for them to deposit into my bank account). That\u2019s a more realistic number for somebody\u2019s who\u2019s fairly active on YouTube. If that\u2019s the kind of big bucks you\u2019re striving for, go for it! Otherwise, focus on your day job (or on getting good grades in school so that you can land a great job when you graduate). Do YouTube for fun. And if you become suddenly popular or go viral, great - enjoy the ride as well as the supplemental income. For most normal people, YouTube is a place to share content because you have content to share, not a place to make a living. - - - - - UPDATE 4/15/20): I wrote this answer in Feb. 2017. About a year later (Jan. 2018), YouTube changed their requirements to require a minimum of 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch (viewing) hours within the last 12 month period in order to be eligible for monetization. That effectively de-monetized my channels as well as tens of thousands of others\u2019 channels\u2026meaning that I\u2019m still stuck under that $10 profits threshold 2+ years later. And since I\u2019m not actively pursuing subscribers (that isn\u2019t why I produce videos and I refuse to stoop to that level), I may never make money off of YouTube. While there were understandable reasons for YouTube\u2019s significant policy change (see this article for some insight on that: YouTube tightens rules around what channels can be monetized), it also has meant that YouTube now prioritizes and rewards those who can create significant \u201cbuzz\u201d in the forms of likes, subscribers, and shares and views on social media, and unfortunately NOT on producing quality content which has sustained relevance or enduring value. My answer here remains surprisingly relevant, though: In YouTube\u2019s Feb. 2018 memo, they specifically note that \u201c99% of those affected [by the policy change] were making less than $100 per year in the last year, with 90% earning less than $2.50 in the last month.\u201d[4] So yes, although many people hear about the people \u201cmaking a living\u201d on YouTube with lucrative profits (some who do indeed have six-figure incomes),[5] here is YouTube itself acknowledging that we\u2019re talking about less than 1% of their content creators who make more than $100 in a year (and only 10% of YouTube\u2019s content creators make more than $30 in a year)! And, if you can\u2019t (or don\u2019t want to) generate 1,000 subscribers and sustain a regular viewership of 4000+ watch hours per year on your channel, you won\u2019t make anything. Further, for any new channels created after that policy change, you don\u2019t start earning until you reach that level.

            "answer_text": "In February I was lucky enough to get an unexpected viral YouTube hit. Throughout 2014 I played table tennis almost every day as part of what we called the Expert in a Year challenge. We videod each training session and as a round-up we put together a one-second-a-day video, published it on YouTube and forgot about it. Someone found it, posted it to Reddit and over the course of a few days the world went mad. We clocked up over 1.5 million views and were featured on many news sites including BBC, Huffington Post and Digg. (You can see the video at the bottom of this answer) Just after it happened I wrote about the experience and what happened in this post. But I left out one thing. How much money we made. It's nine months since then and I'm pretty sure we've now made almost all of the direct earnings we're going to from it. Here's how much it made: We have made..... drum roll... $825. The video currently has 1,770,000 views. That is an incredible amount of people! It's more than the populations of Washington DC, Detroit and Las Vegas all put together. When put like that, \u20ac775 feels pretty rubbish. That's $0.00047 for every view. Ouch. Let's look a bit deeper. For the first 150,000 views, we didn't have monetization turned on. In fact, the button was greyed out on the YouTube dashboard. They had detected that we were using someone else's track for the background music. After the video started to go viral we got contacted by a bunch of different companies offering to manage the video for us. One advantage they had over going it alone was they could turn that monetization on. After looking at our options we decided to sign up with Storyful. The ongoing deal was that any revenue would be split 50/50 between us and the song's artist. Of that 50% share, we would get 60% and Storyful would get 40%. In other words we would earn 30% of the total revenue the video brought in. Storyful also had a few other things to offer us. They would try and license our video out to other sites and they offered us a $300 sign-up bonus. Here's the total revenue breakdown: Signup bonus: $300YouTube: \u20ac340.11Other sites and licenses: \u20ac154.69I have no idea why they're mixing dollars and euros, but there we go. So in total the video itself has earned \u20ac775 ($825 or \u00a3543). Seeing as we got 30% of total revenue from YouTube. If we had instead found a way to keep 100% of it, we would have earned \u20ac1,133.7. As monetization wasn't turned on at the beginning, let's ignore the first 200,000 views. That is \u20ac0.64 per 1,000 views. Which is quite a bit less than what some of the other answers are claiming! Low-Value Traffic Quite a few people have mentioned that your earnings are all based on the number of clicks on the adverts. Perhaps our CPM is so low because the people watching the video just weren't translating. One of my businesses is a table tennis brand. In the video description we put in a link to our table tennis bat that I used throughout the challenge. Here a screenshot of the analytics on my Amazon seller account.  When the video went viral there was a huge jump in the number of views on the table tennis bat listing on Amazon. But the number of items ordered doesn't seem to have been effected at all... I imagine that is probably because our traffic actually had no interest in table tennis. They were more interested in why a weirdo like me would bother trying to play ping pong everyday for a year... Hope that helps... Here's the video - enjoy!  ",
