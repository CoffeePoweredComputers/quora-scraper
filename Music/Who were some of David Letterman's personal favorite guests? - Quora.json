            "answer_text": "Ray Romano, because David Letterman\u2019s company produced Everybody Loves Raymond and Ray made it a hit and made Letterman a lot of extra cash. Merv Griffin, because he\u2019s one of the fathers of the modern talk show, was a huge and hilarious personality, and used to have David on his old show before he was famous. Don Rickles, because he was an incredible guest, a comedy legend, made it so easy on the host with his rapid-fire jokes, and had a personal friendship with Letterman. Howard Stern, because their careers paralleled each other, they\u2019re both New York figures and had many common enemies, most notably NBC. They always defended each other when the other was in trouble. Norm Macdonald, because Norm really admired David and looked up to him as something of a father figure. Norm was always a great guest, and David defended Norm through his many foibles in the entertainment business, such as his abrupt SNL Weekend Update firing. Regis Philbin, because they were friends. I\u2019m not sure how or why, but they had a personal relationship. I just think Regis is friends with everybody. Regis typically appeared on the show when things were bad, such as the first show after 9/11 and upon David\u2019s return from heart surgery. He enjoyed some of the women too: Sandra Bernhard, Drew Barrymore, Marilu Henner and Tina Fey. Dave\u2019s not really comfortable with the ladyfolk, but he had a good rapport with these. ",
