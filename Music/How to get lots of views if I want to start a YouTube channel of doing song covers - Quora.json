            "answer_text": "Getting views has nothing to do with the quality of your videos. That's the first mistake starting YouTubers make. They think: \"if I just make my videos really really good, people will automagically find them and I'll get lots of views!\" I'm sorry, but that's not gonna happen. It's all about your videos getting discovered. You have to understand that there are millions and millions of video being uploaded every day. When you upload your videos, they get added to that huge pile. How big of a chance do you have of people automatically stumbling over them? Maybe one or two viewers will, but they won't come swarming in by the boatloads if you don't make an effort to spread your videos. You have to become a part of the YouTube community. Find lots of other YouTube channels that do song covers, subscribe to them and leave nice comments to their videos. And I'm not just talking about the big channels, but especially about the smaller channels (100 subs or less). You can use The YouTube ChannelCrawler  to find them. If you leave nice, inspiring and uplifting comments on other people's videos, they will highly appreciate it and they will almost always check your channel out as well. That's how you get your very first subscribers. Also, be sure to make your channel as attractive as possible. Create a good avatar and banner. Have a good channel description. Use playlists to organize your videos. Create an appealing channel trailer. Have good thumbnails for your videos. And here's another thing that a lot of people forget: make your subscriptions public on the Channels-tab. If you do, channels that you subscribe to will get an e-mail telling them you subscribed to them. And especially people who don't get that many subscribers get ecstatic over such e-mails, and they will almost immediately check your channel out. As for your content: please, make your covers as good as possible. But be sure to add some other videos as well. YouTube is a very personal website and your audience want to interact with you personally. So make a vlog from time to time, to talk about your channels, answer questions from subscribers or talk about music in general. Asking questions to your subscribers is another way to improve interaction, which is what you want. And don't forget to ask your viewers to like the video, because that's how videos get spread on YouTube. Also, be sure to use a lot of other social media to accompany your YouTube channel. Create a Facebook page, a Twitter account, perhaps an Instagram or Pinterest account. Use the Google+ page that you got with your channel. Sure, it takes some effort for those social media to grow, but if they do, they are great ways to promote your videos. Subscribers don't always check if there are new videos in their subscriptions feed. But if they also see your video on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or wherever, they are five times more likely to notice it and watch it. Finally, please, please, please, for the love of all that's holy... be patient! You won't become the next YouTube star within three months. It takes a lot of time and effort to build your audience and you'll definitely reach a point where it just doesn't seem worth it. But I guarantee you that your audience will grow exponentially. It may take a month to get your first 20 subscribers, but you could suddenly reach 50 or 100 subscribers in the month after that. Keep your goals small at first, and increase them as your channel grows. Appreciate the little achievements that you'll get (your first 10 subscribers, your first 1000 total views, or 1000 views on a single video). That's how YouTube stays fun for you. You have plenty of time to grow. Don't rush it! I hope this helps you. Good luck with your channel, and I hope you'll have a lot of fun in your YouTube career :). ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there! First of all, congrats on understanding the first step to getting an engaging YouTube channel is creating quality and valuable content! Unfortunately, this won\u2019t get you any views unless you understand how the YouTube algorithm works - and how to get traffic to your channel from external sources as well.  So, what you can (and should) do is: Ask your friends to share your video on their social media profiles, like it and, most importantly: comment on it.Get people to watch your entire videos video, not just the first few seconds. The most crucial factor is that all those things need to be done as soon as the video is published.Do keyword research and implementation. Lots of people forget that the title and description of the video matter.Use annotations. They enable you to start a dialog with your audience if you use them as a call to action. Just make sure they enrich the video and don\u2019t distract from the main ideaCross-promote. Always promote your videos separately on social media - not just your entire channel.Some people also buy followers, but if you decide to go this way, you should be aware that YouTube forbids it. The consequences are typically deleted views and followers, but it\u2019s also possible that you might lose your channel if you do it often. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on your quality of song you are going to cover. I have been promoting Bollywood cover songs since 2015 & in past 3 years, have managed to get 200k subscribers & 45M views in total. I would like to share few things - Your audio quality should be perfect. Choose best studio in town, try them & see whose composition suits you. Choose songs that are from upcoming movies & infact few old hits.If you have a good budget you can opt in video category multi cam & drone clips and if possible include female models, works well in many videos.Now comes promotion, choose marketer who has been doing this for a while & has a strong cover song network, you can't go to some WordPress developer & ask can you promote, offcourse he will do but you'll end up getting spammy video views. Choose good network of influencers who are similar niche & who give you actual sound proof of reports & screenshot of work.If this all works, you'll end up getting millions of views & then shared revenue on your video, approx 175$ per million that's low but you'll get some good shows & events that will make you very good amount of money, 10x times from YT views.I have tried this everything in real & practically made my living out of it. I am not here to boast or just scoop out my own theory. This actually works & is great for musicians out there. If you're stuck anywhere i can help further. Let me know. Thank you for your question. I hope it clears your doubt. ",

            "answer_text": "Great answers so far but I wanted to provide more actionable advice. Here are some things you can do to promote your vlogs and get some views / subs. Of course, your vlogs have got to be worth watching or no amount of promotion will help :) Post on Reddit There are tons of subreddits specifically for posting your vlogs like /r/vlogging /r/vlogs and /r/vlogging Share on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram Get in the habit of doing this fir every vlog you upload. Even if you don\u2019t have much of a following, it\u2019s still worth posting so potential followers can see your content. Engage with the YouTube community Like Nett said, the best way to get your first initial subscribers is by being active on YouTube. Leave helpful or insightful comments on other vloggers\u2019 videos, even the ones with hardly any subscribers. Do this regularly and it will become a regular source of views and subscribers. Post on Google+ There are actually a bunch of vlogging communities on Google+. Just search \u201cvlog\u201d and filter by communities. I only recently stumbled upon these so I\u2019m not sure if there are any quality views there, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to try! Start a blog We post a lot of our travel vlogs on our blog. Usually we just tell the story of a place or a day that was included in the vlog, then we attach the vlog there so people can view that perspective if they\u2019d like. This is a long term strategy, but one that I highly recommend if you want to build consistent views. I hope it helps, happy vlogging! ",

            "answer_text": "Many people have answered already.I will quote an example happened with me recently. An example of starting trend/promotion I am person who usually don't open shared links , but then this came -  Translation :- Click the first letter of your name and see which song u get.  2) Translation :-Share it with your friends and see which song they get. I clicked to S and then   Translation for 3 and 4 People were commenting who came through whatsapp message. It was an example but you can do something similar or may be different by offering a value to your target audience. Music is a beautiful emotion , try to connect with your audience.Mouth to mouth publicity is still the most effective strategy. Thank you. ",
