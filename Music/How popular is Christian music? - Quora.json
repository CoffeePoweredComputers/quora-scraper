            "answer_text": "In my opinion, Christian music is wildly popular with those who want a change from other genres. I enjoy all types of music but, Christian music is the only category that has the power to bring about a physical emotional response in myself. Have you ever heard a song that brings you to tears? Or one that fills your heart with joy? There are many songs and lyrics that lift me up when I\u2019m down and tunes that will move you to give thanks and praise. It has many sub-categories such as rock, pop, worship, rap and others. There\u2019s something for everyone. Christian music is popular enough that there is the Dove Awards, similar to the Grammys, given out to recognize musical achievements in the Christian industry. Many artists and groups hold concerts and music festivals that hundreds of fans attend regularly. I would say Contemporary Christian music has a huge fan base for this specific type of category. I have been a fan since the 1970s and I feel the music has gotten better since then but, I still like the old classics from long ago also. The popularity of Christian music will be around for a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "Love it!  Ah hell what about Islamic death metal/grindcore?  Religious music can be fun right when done right? My friend Michael is a huge fan of God and metal. It works for him and I quite like the music. As other metallers are aware, the lyrics are insignificant - but the lyrics are significant for religious folk. Popularity is based on the music not the lyrics if I\u2019m honest. It\u2019s a niche. But for Christians it kinda is. I\u2019m an atheist. It makes no difference on what I love to get involved in. Christians can mosh like the rest of us. And I\u2019m glad they do. Evidently they can play music better than us unbelievers sometimes. ",
