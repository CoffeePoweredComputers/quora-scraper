You can\u2019t deliberately make \u201ccopyright free\u201d music. Or any kind of content. You can let people use it for free, but that\u2019s still a use license, created by your right as copyright owner.

They do own the copyrights, but they allow others to license the music for a set price, so that continuous royalties do not have to be paid. They like making money and like having their music used by others. ",
