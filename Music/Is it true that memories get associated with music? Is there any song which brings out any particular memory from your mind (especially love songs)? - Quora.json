            "answer_text": "Yeah that's true..though I will say that defined memories are associated with songs with lyrics. The sentiments that we hold within,unable to find the right words to mouth them,find immediate connection with the lyrics and it reflects a particular phase of our life,or a person..Let me give you a few examples: 1> Blue Night by MLTR:    This song reminds me of the time when I was in Class 9 or 10,and I really liked this girl from my neighborhood. Those days,I didn't have any music player other than an old Tape and ofcourse there was no mobile phone to play music. I used to go up to our rooftop and hum this song to myself. The skies were generally very clear during those early wintry nights..I still miss those moments. 2> Love will keep us alive by Eagles  This is one of the first English songs that I have heard,back in class 8, in the year 2003. Still one of my favorites. It reminds of those simpler times when I actually believed that \"love could keep us alive\". The good old days,when I was genuinely romantic. 3> Last Christmas by Wham    \"Last Christmas I gave you my heart,and the very next day you gave it away\" , \" I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\" I heard this song for the first time in my dad's Nokia phone,it was present as a ringtone. Little did I knew that I will spent so many years of my adolescent life reflecting over,how accurately this  mid 80s song depicts my love life in mid 2000s.  4> Wild is the Wind by Bon Jovi   My choicest song for ultimate heartbreak,depression and loneliness. When you try everything that's within your power to make her stay but she leaves anyway.  There are lots of other tracks,that are associated with different memories of my life. But I think that's the difference between songs with lyrics and just music. I am an avid listener of music without any lyrics. Yanni's composition, each composition of his actually, triggers a different emotion in my heart,bringing nostalgia, my sense of harmony with my surrounding, memories of an bygone era. But its a coalesced form. Its never indicating to one particular painful memory. Memories can be painful but nostalgia just evokes the sensation of a warm longing. ",

            "answer_text": "Its absolutely true that our memory and music are interlinked. I don't know the reason for this but have some experiences which supports this phenomena. This usually happens when you listen to a particular song/songs repeatedly during certain phase of time or period where you are under following situations : Peaceful : There is a song called 'Bahara'(beautiful climate) sung by Shreya Goshal from the movie I Hate Love Stories and whenever I listen to this song with that sweet voice of Shreya it brings me back the memories of one night where I spent around 4 hours sitting inside a train near a window seat. I had kept the song in repeat mode, and with cool breeze flowing over my face, it was seriously heavenly. And now whenever I listen to this song again this memory quite vividly plays inside my mind. Emotional Stress : When I joined my first year in college, I was under a lot of emotional stress. Not that I wasn't excited about college, but whenever you go to a new environment you are definitely under some stress without knowing yourself. And for first month I didn't have anything to do, no laptop or major assignments. So all I did was listening to music. There were certain tamil songs which I specifically listened to during that period daily. And just as I said above now when I listen to these  songs now it quite clearly brings me back the memories of my first semester ! I mean there were other songs which I had listened to numerous times in my 2nd, 3rd year but they don't associate to me with anything. Playing A Game with music in your headset : This may sound silly but I was infatuated with a game GTA San Andreas, and over a period of time I got bored with its original background sound effects so I started listened to then newly released songs of Ghajjini(name of an emperor), especially 'Behka' (intoxicated) and 'Gujarish' (request). Who knew that now when I listen to these songs I would remember nothing about that movie but only about so many ways to kill people in that game ! I guess the point here is that when you are doing something not aware of your external environment, like in this case playing a game with headsets on, the song gets stored in your memory with what you have been doing.Surely there are other situations where music is associated to our memory, but for me these situations quite summarizes all songs that brings me past memories to my mind.
