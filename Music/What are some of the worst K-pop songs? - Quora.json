Let\u2019s take for exmaple SUPERM\u2019s \u201c100\u201d. It\u2019s a very catchy song, and has amazing visuals from each member:        but some of the lyrics made me feel like:  I\u2019m just going to say the lyrics im talking about: \u201cThey all want they all want what we got\u201d I mean, I guess it\u2019s true,,. But there a distinct things that make a person unique, that everyone at some point wants to have this characteristic or thing that makes that person special, maybe im just thinking too much about this, but I mean, well yeah, lol. \u201cWe go straight to the top\u201d and \u201cyou know we taking the crown\u201d May I ask, the crown to what exactly? I think personally fame really means nothing, it\u2019s the music and what message you get from it that matters, and of course, there are many songs like \u201c100\u201d that have lyrics like this, and honestly I think that\u2019s kinda self centered a little bit, but you know, it\u2019s only a song, the members are very funny, and kind, and I love them all <3 These three are the ones that stood out to me, well, in an very cringey way. NOTE: English is not my first language, so I apoligze if some of it doesn\u2019t make sense, I tried to make it as simple as possible \ud83d\ude05 Thank you for reading, and,,\u2026,,  (If you made it this far, here are some memes to (hopefully) lighten up your day:        \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc99 Peace\u270c\ufe0f ",
