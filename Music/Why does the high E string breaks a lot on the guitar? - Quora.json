            "answer_text": "Data on string breakage is mostly anecdotal. I see some saying that the high E breaks most often because it\u2019s the thinnest, but it\u2019s under less tension than the G string, which many others say breaks most often. Breaks generally occur due to defects or errors of some sort, either in the string, or at the bridge, or at the nut, or because the strings are tuned too high, or have been subjected to too much stress, and so on. I\u2019ve been playing the guitar for over 50 years and I think maybe I\u2019ve broken a total of 5 strings. And it think it was mostly B strings. It almost always happens on guitars on which I change tunings a lot. I subject the strings to a lot of change in tension, and eventually the tensile strength of the string gives way, perhaps due to metal fatigue. But under typical conditions strings should not be breaking. ",

            "answer_text": "The high E-string really shouldn\u2019t break a lot on any guitar. A little more often than the thicker strings but never a lot. If you break new or new-ish strings often you need to examine where the break happens. It tends to be places like a tuning post, string tree, nut slot, Bridge or bridge saddle. It is often a sharp edge or burr that may need to be carefully filed or sanded down. There may also be the above combined with a bit heavy handed playing. It is not uncommon for beginners to break strings more often than an experienced player. There are also sub standard/very cheap strings and even counterfeit strings floating around, making matters worse. If you are at all in doubt, you should let an experienced individual check out your guitar. It is almost always an easy fix. ",
