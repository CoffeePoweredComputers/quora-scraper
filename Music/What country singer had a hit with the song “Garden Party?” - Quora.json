            "answer_text": "John Fogerty from The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again (2009; w/ Don Henley & Timothy B. Schmit). While closely following the original in pace, Fogerty\u2019s version definitely has a country feel. I\u2019m not aware of another cover by a \u201ccountry singer,\u201d but I\u2019ll keep my ears open.  Per Wikipedia: Ricky Nelson re-recorded \"Garden Party\" with The Jordanaires and studio musicians for his 1985 album All My Best. Country singer Johnny Lee recorded a cover version of the song in the late 1970s, entitled \"Country Party\", with slightly altered lyrics.  Dwight Yoakam has also performed it live in concert. In 2000 Tarsha Vega sampled \"Garden Party\" in her song \"Be Ya Self\" for the soundtrack for The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. The UK band, Smokie, recorded a cover of the song. [6] In 2009, John Fogerty recorded the song with the Eagles' Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit, for his The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Againalbum. In 2012, Adam Young of Owl City covered the song and released it to his SoundCloud and personal blog followers. The song was pulled off of SoundCloud in late 2015, but can still be found on YouTube. On December 31, 2012, Phish opened their New Year's Eve concert with the song at Madison Square Garden. [7] Phish bassist and singer Mike Gordon, who sang lead on the tune, wore a shirt very reminiscent of the one George Harrison wore on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Gary Pig Gold recorded his own personal take on the song, which reflected an encounter with Rick himself and appeared, in 2013, on Pop Garden Radio's Legacy: A Tribute to Rick Nelson Volume 1 CD. Tesla guitarist Frank Hannon covered the song, assisted by Matthew and Gunnar Nelson, on his 2018 solo album From One Place to Another Vol. 1.
