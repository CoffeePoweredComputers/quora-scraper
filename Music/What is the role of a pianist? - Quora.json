            "answer_text": "Some people say you should make the piece of music \u201cyour own\u201d and \u201cbring something out that no-one else has.\u201d The implication is that this will make you a good musician and your performances interesting, compelling or otherwise deserving of a listen. If that\u2019s true, I\u2019m a genius, as you can tell by each of my interpretations of this Brahms Intermezzo, op. 16, no. 6, in E, for piano: Let\u2019s play it on a completely ruined piano http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-RUINEDPIANO.mp3 Let\u2019s \u201cinterpret\u201d the timing http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-TIMING.mp3 I like the parts that aren\u2019t the melody. They\u2019re more \u201cinteresting\u201d than just hearing the melody as prominent all the time. I mean, how boring! http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-WRONG-MELODY.mp3 Here\u2019s some other non-melodic bits forced to become the \u201cmain part.\u201d http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-WRONG-MELODY-2.mp3 I think it\u2019s more interesting to hear it faster. After all, we live in an age when you can travel over 500 mph. Brahms didn\u2019t. http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-TOO-FAST.mp3 Or, let\u2019s try going slow enough to ponder and weigh each moment. http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-TOO-SLOW.mp3 Come to think of it, why should I play the measures in the order in which they are printed? http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-RANDOM-ORDER.mp3 Or, how about in this order? http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-WRONG-ORDER.mp3 I like surprises! http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-RANDOM-ACCENTS.mp3 Sometimes it\u2019s just beautiful pianism to linger. Just \u2026 linger!! http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-RANDOM-RUBATO.mp3 Or, push! PUSH! http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-XTREME-RUBATO.mp3 Now let\u2019s bring out the bass. http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-SUBBASS.mp3 Octave equivalency means I can do this. http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-WRONG-OCTAVE.mp3 Maybe add some popular music idiomatic element? http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-FAST-DRUMS.mp3 While we\u2019re at it, it don\u2019t mean a thing if it ain\u2019t got \u2026 http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-SWING-DRUMS.mp3 Hell, I don\u2019t know why we need to limit ourselves to piano. If Brahms had ever seen a drum set, I bet he would approve of this. http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/intermezzo-op.-116-no.-6-DRUMSET.mp3 Or, you could just try to put the sounds together in such a way that they align with the given elements written down by Brahms. http://www.paulhenrysmith.com/wp-content/uploads/brahms-intermezzo-op116-no6-FULL.mp3 ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on what type of music we are talking about. For classical piano, the general expectation is that the pianist will keep to the score as written-the role of the pianist here would be to interpret the music. To do this, generally the pianist will use the notations on the score in addition to whatever knowledge he or she would have regarding the composer\u2019s mood as well as the circumstances when the piece was written. Sometimes that information is known, sometimes not. For example, Chopin\u2019s \u201cRevolutionary Etude\u201d was composed after Chopin found out that Poland had been conquered. This was a man who was fiercely proud of his country, and had to leave in order to avoid imprisonment and to find his way in the music world. He was sad and angry when he wrote this piece, and it is this mood that the pianist needs to convey. Generally with classical music, the more you know about the composer, his style, and the circumstances around the music, the better the interpretation can be, but sometimes, you don\u2019t have the information regarding the circumstances-so you use the score to help figure out how it should be performed as well as previous performances of the piece. There are accepted interpretations-for example a performance of the first movement of the \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d is generally not played loudly, and such a performance isn\u2019t considered to be a legitimate interpretation of the piece. For jazz or pop or any other form of music, sticking to exactly what is written is not the norm-improvising is encouraged and routinely done, so the role of the pianist here would literally be to create something from the bare bones guidance of whatever score they would be given.
