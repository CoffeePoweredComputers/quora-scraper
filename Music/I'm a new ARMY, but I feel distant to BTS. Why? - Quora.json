(Days, weeks, months, etc.)Do you know BTS well enough yet?I can\u2019t tell you much because I don\u2019t know what you mean by distant, but I\u2019m going to guess that you\u2019re very new and don\u2019t know BTS super well yet. That\u2019s fine! I suggest that you watch their old concerts, read more into their history, watch more interviews\u2026basically consume more content from them! I think when you become a new fan of a group you feel distant because there are so many fans who know them like the back of their hand, but you\u2019re just kind of left out. Anyway, feel free to ask me any questions about ARMY or BTS. ",
