I\u2019ve heard \u201cI don\u2019t like kpop because it\u2019s stupid/gross/weird.\u201d Since that\u2019s usually the case people get defensive and don\u2019t accept the way you said it.They accept that you dislike it but they don\u2019t accept the way you said it.

            "answer_text": "I am not actually a Kpop fan before and listen more of western music, I have friends who likes Kpop or Jpop and when they recommend to listen on this song I would humbly accept it and tell my opinion, of course it is my PERSONAL opinion and they will respect it. Its just that some people gets easily offended whenever someone rejects what they like. I think it depends on the person on how they will say that they do not like the genre or they are not a fan of it. As I said before, I am not a fan of KPOP before, but now I enjoy listening to their music. We don\u2019t know what or when will others preference will change, so just chill out and don\u2019t be bothered when someone said they are not a fan of what you like :) ",
