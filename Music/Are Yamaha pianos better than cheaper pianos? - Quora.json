            "answer_text": "Look closely at the logo now a dirt bike stamped with a triple tuning fork logo is a nice machine for tearing up the outdoors yet the company logo sports a strong musical reference. My opinion is all Yamaha gear i have played with or owned has been worth the price. A cheaper priced unit has a fair amount of quality and a high quality piece is worth the extra coin. Based on musical instruments and equipment i have used and dirt bikes and quads ridden off the top of my head i am sure i have used other Yamaha products and just don't recall them at the moment. ",
