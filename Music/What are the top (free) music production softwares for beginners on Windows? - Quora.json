            "answer_text": "Check out MuLab. It is a free software. But there are quite lot of limitations. You cannot install third party plugins. And you have only 4 synths to choose from. Otherwise you can check out FL Studio, they have unlimited trial version. The trial version is fully functional. Only drawback of the demo version is that you cannot reopen saved files. But you can render it to MP3 or WAV format. I recommend that you should buy a full version of FL Studio. They are quite cheap as compared to the features they provide. Editions Hope this answer helps you! Have a great day!! ",
