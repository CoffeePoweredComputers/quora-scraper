            "answer_text": "Its a complicated process and does not work very well. The quality is greatly affected and is reduced significantly. A vocal is mixed in the center track of a song and is usually of a prominent level ,making it an integral part of the whole song. If you want the vocal track of a song, you should look for \u201cstems\u201d or \u201cvocal acapella\u201d on the web, many services provide users with stems. A stem is purely an isolated track with just the sound, eg: only the guitar lead of a song, or just the recorded vocals of the song, or just the snare drums in the song etc. ",
