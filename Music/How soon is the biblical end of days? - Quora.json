            "answer_text": "Since my answer about Irenaeus has been merged it\u2019s a little off topic so I will add a more specific answer here. I will make it fairly short, but I do have to skip some background. The Book of Revelation covers seven seals. Much to the dismay of some, the seals open in order to show sequence of events in history. I\u2019ve argued this in detail but won\u2019t get into it here. The first four seals are the conquest, war, famine, and plagues etc. of the last twenty centuries since John\u2019s Revelation. The four horsemen have had different missions throughout history (see Zechariah 1 and Zechariah 6 where the riders are described as the four spirits of heaven). After this last 2,000 years of the horsemen\u2019s actions, the martyrs of history under the throne cry out, \u201cHow much longer?\u201d That is seal five from Revelation 6. Seal six has not happened yet. It is a disaster from the heavens like Earth has never seen before. Jesus appears in the heavens at this time (possibly the rapture). Seal seven begins in Revelation 8. This is more disaster. The final 70th week of Daniel, begins in Revelation 11 (1260 days or 3 1/2 years). The other half of the 7 years is in Revelation 13. So, we find that seal 6 and the first part of seal 7 occur before this. Revelation chapter 7:9-14, during seal 6, tells us that that the saints have come out of the Great Tribulation (the rapture). This means that there are some events which occur between Revelation 6:12 and Revelation 11 that happen before the 7 year period. This could be a matter of months to a few years. We know the locust in Revelation 9 plague the world for 5 months. This period before the 7 years, when the antichrist makes his peace with Israel, is a period of chaos which is just the right atmosphere for the antichrist to come to power by intrigue, as the Bible says. Altogether, there could be approximately 8\u201310 years total. The Origin of An Observation We Have Heard Before Adam---------Abraham-----Moses--------Jesus --------2nd Advent 4000 BC------2000 BC------1400 BC ------0 AD---------2000+ AD There is an interesting observation made by the 2nd century church father Irenaeus, made of the span of biblical history which all who follow Bible history have heard before but may have not known its origin. It's the idea that the history of man in the Bible covers 6000 years between his creation and the end time, as in a day is as a thousand years to God. This, a comparison with the creation week of seven days, each day covering 1,000 years. With the millennium we would have the entire week. Some date-setters go so far as to predict the Second Advent occur exactly two thousand years after Jesus crucifixion, but support for this precision is not warranted by any scriptural precedent. Irenaeus does not cover the millennium, but he does see, in his reflection on the Books of Daniel and Revelation, the antichrist and the final 7-year period as set at the end of 6000 years. So according to the interpretation of Irenaeus, that would put us in prime time for end time events. He was not a prophet, but it, nevertheless, is an interesting observation. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is: we are not told. In the bible some propecies tells us exactly when things will happen but in the case of the end it is not specified; only Jehovah God and Jesus Christ know. What we know, however, is that it has to be quite soon. Why? There was a very complex sign given by Jesus and it consisted of 28 different elements to come true and now, they have all come true. So, the end should be soon. But how soon? We do not know. For more info: http://jw.org Last Days: Keep Busy During the Last of \u201cthe Last Days\u201d ",
