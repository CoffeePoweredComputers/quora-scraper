            "answer_text": "It has been and always will be Jump. The old Van Halen were all there in their glory. One of the best front men around, Roth, Eddie and that smile of his with his furious guitar playing, Anthony and his thumping bass but most of all, Alex Van Halen with the gorgeous hi hat wash and solid beat in the song. Simple but gorgeous. But then, he goes into the fun little off time beat during the lead. Innovative and unbelievably tasty. Alex surely belongs right up there at the top. One of my favorite drummers. I just love this song and this video.  Above Van Halen  Above my girl Sina at age 14. She does a great job. Been watching Sina do drum covers for awhile now. Fantastic drummer. She looks like she could be my granddaughter Taylor\u2019s twin. It\u2019s uncanny. I taught Taylor to drum when she was 14 also. ",
