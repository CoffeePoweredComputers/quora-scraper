            "answer_text": "In addition to the different cost and functions between free and premimum Spotify account mentioned by others below, as an artist, if you want to boost the streams of your songs well, you need understand the nature of premimum and free account. This may help you: 1, The uses of them is different Premium users are music nerds, usually they want to be the first people to discover something new. On the other hand, free users want a much more guided experience and they are casual listener. 2, Traffic statistics from them are different You get paid whether or not a song is played by a premium subscription user, or a free user. The difference is where the money comes from. When an artist gets paid from a premium play, they\u2019re getting paid out of the total bucket of money that they\u2019ve collected from all of our premium users. When they get paid from a free play, they\u2019re getting paid from bucket of money that comes from all of their advertising. Today\u2019s free user, might be the tomorrow\u2019s subscriber. Some listeners might start out on the ad supported experience when they\u2019ve got say less cash to burn. 3, Listener experience is different With the free experience, there are some restrictions. Most of the catalog that a free listeners has access to, they can only shuffle through, so they don\u2019t have as much control over what they\u2019re listening to and when. Free users also don\u2019t get some of the premium features, like high quality audio, unlimited skips, or the ability to save songs and play them offline. But they still get the most import feature for discovery: playlists One of the best promises about our free tier is introducing fans to the coolest most interesting, and the best music for them. ",
