            "answer_text": "let\u2019s get iiiit chan: very humble, extremely caring. he loves the members a lot and isn\u2019t afraid to show it at all. he\u2019s also very passionate about music (writing and producing). woojin: one word; soft. he\u2019s very goofy and calm. in interviews, he mostly listens to what the other members say, and doesn\u2019t talk much. he\u2019s the oldest member, so he, like chan, cares for the younger ones a lot. changbin: at first, he seems very dark. when i first got into skz, he scared me. but he really i just another soft crackhead of the group. he also spits fire. he, like chan, is also very passionate about producing and writing lyrics. minho: he, much like changbin, seems very dark. he\u2019s pretty shy, meaning he doesn\u2019t talk much in interviews. but, he\u2019s amazing at dancing and is very charismatic on stage. (one of the reasons why he\u2019s my bias.) hyunjin: he\u2019s very dramatic. in a good way. when he\u2019s with other people (not the members) he seems pretty uncomfortable/shy. but he\u2019s the definition of a crackhead. like minho, he\u2019s part of the dance line, so he\u2019s very passionate about dancing. jisung: jokes. a lot of them. he gets called squirrel by the members, due to him stuffing his cheeks with food. he\u2019s amazing at rapping, and is part of 3racha along with chan and changbin. he\u2019s also very soft. <3 felix: he\u2019s pretty serious. like when they do dance practices, the other members fool around, while he\u2019s completely focused on dancing. in their vlives though, he\u2019s very chaotic. he\u2019s also part of the dance line, with minho and hyunjin. seungmin: he seems scary at first, but he\u2019s actually just a soft baby boy. he resembles a puppy a lot, due to his big eyes. he\u2019s one of the (if not the) cutest members of the group. i personally think his dancing skills are underrated. jeongin: baby boy culture once again. he\u2019s also very cute. i don\u2019t have much to write about him, but he\u2019s very kindhearted and loves all of his hyungs. i am aware that i put minho and changbin in the wrong order but i\u2019m too lazy to change it. ~aria louise ",
