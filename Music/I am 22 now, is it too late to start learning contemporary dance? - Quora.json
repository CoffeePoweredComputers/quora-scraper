Try and attend a minimum of 2 classes a week and don\u2019t stop unless you have to\u2026it will include lots of stretching exercises in each session before going through the steps of each dance. Within a year, you will start noticing the flexibility of your body and your ability to create your own choreography. ",

            "answer_text": "Practicing and learning. Taking class, showing up, exploring. Questioning how your movement works, what your habits are and challenging them. If you read the biographies of many really well known dancers and choreographers you\u2019ll see that many of them started dancing well into their 20s or beyond. I started dancing at 19 and am totally committed to it. At college, my tutors commented that it took me longer to learn sequences (because I was not familiar with the vocabulary) but when I learnt them I had often read the movement more accurately than most of my peers (because I had no preconceptions about how to do the movement). Dance is a long road - they say it takes at least 7 years to make a dancer, so start now and keep going. ",
