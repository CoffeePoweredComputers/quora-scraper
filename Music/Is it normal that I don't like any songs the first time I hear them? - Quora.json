            "answer_text": "There are different meanings of the word \"normal,\" yes?  Do you mean typical? Then my answer would be perhaps not. I've never come across someone who says they never liked any music the first time they heard it. Do you mean for normal to mean healthy? If so, as a layman, I can't see how this could be a health problem, mental or phsyical. It's just your way of experiencing the world. Do you have another meaning for the word \"normal?\" If so, do tell. ",

I'm a die hard music fan.I listen to everything(literally)...It doesnt matter if you dont like a song the first time you hear it.Personally, I didnt like some of A.R.Rahman's songs the first time I heard them! But the more I hear his songs, the more I like them :) So, ya its completely normal :) ",
