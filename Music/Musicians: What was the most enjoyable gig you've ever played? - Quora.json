            "answer_text": "Dec 2001, Proven, Belgium. I got back in my home town in Belgiun, after a year in the US: hadn\u2019t seen my family and friends in Belgium since a year. In the weeks leading up to that vacation, it was decided by friends of mine in my hometown that I should play a show for all my good old friends I grew up with. They would organize it, take care of all the promo and publicity, and so on. I would just have to get a band together and play the show. They would set a date and inform me about the date. When these peeps organize something, they do an outstanding job: huge stage, professional sound guy, professional lighting, food for the musicians, opening act(s), the whole shabang. I immediately contacted some really good musician friends on the homefront, some of whom I had performed with in years passed. It didn\u2019t take too long to find all the musicians I needed, who were comfortable learning and memorizing 2\u20133 hours of music in only a couple of days/weeks time. We would play a 2\u20133 hour set of all fiery rock covers, including Judas Priest \u201cBreaking The Law\u201d, Motorhead \u201cAce of Spades\u201d, Accept \u201cBalls To The Wall\u201d, Ozzy\u2019s \u201cNo More Tears\u201d, Savatage \u201cJesus Saves\u201d, Rush \u201cYYZ\u201d and \u201cLeave That Thing Alone\u201d, ... stuff like that. Upon landing in Belgium, mom and dad came to get me at the airport in Brussels. As we started getting closer to my hometown after about an hour of driving, I started seeing all these full size posters announcing the show. There were 2\u20133 bands opening up for me, and it was weird, and an interesting feeling, to see my name in huge letters at the top of these posters, hanging all over the towns we passed through, in windows of bars and on boards. During the first days of my vacation, I got together with my band to discuss logistics, rehearsals and so on. In the next few days we had 3\u20134 long, intense rehearsals or so, and we were ready to play a show. The venue was a warehouse type of thing I had never been at before. So the day of the show, when I went in early for a long sound check, many hours before the show, I was taken aback a bit by how large the venue was. It looked like it could hold 800\u20131000 people. I was like: \u201cMan\u2026 I hope some people show up\u201d. I hadn\u2019t been there since a year, and hadn\u2019t really kept in touch all the well with anybody in past year. An hour before the show, people started coming in. It was a bit emotional, to see so many very close friends back who I had missed. By the time I walked on stage to play like my life depended on it\u2026 the place was\u2026 PACKED!!!!! My band, all really good friends of mine, was AMAZING!! We just had this effortless flow on stage, like we had been playing together since 30 years. We hadn\u2019t. We had barely had 3 or 4 rehearsals. There was this undefinable magic in the air. There was a security fence in front of the stage with some security people between the fence and the stage, just mainly in case someone would feel unwell from all the drinking (I guess, haha), or just to get all bases covered, being that there were also people from older ages, family and so on. Mom and dad were standing right in front of me, with about 1000 people going nuts and partying behind them. I could read how proud they were in their eyes. So at some point\u2026 and this is one of the most amazing things I ever experienced.. I am right in the middle of an extended, killer guitar solo. As I often do, I am soloing with my eyes closed, my head slightly tilted up, looking into the heavens with my eyes closed, totally lost in the moment, my legs wide apart firmly planted onto the stage, my body moving and swaying as if I am possessed, which I am at that time\u2026 by the music. And then\u2026 while I am lost in the music, in the whole groove my rhyhm section is throwing out like they\u2019re magicians\u2026 engulfed by a whirlpool of amazing sound and energy surrounding me\u2026 I\u2026 Am I hearing this ???\u2026 In the distance\u2026 What\u2026?? What is that\u2026 ?? Is this really happening\u2026 ??? NO way\u2026 I need to open my eyes\u2026 And I do so\u2026 And to my utter shock, amazement, disbelief\u2026 there really is no word to describe what I saw or how it made me feel.. I see an ocean of people (as a matter of speaking), EVERYBODY in the venue\u2026 jumping up and down waving their fists/ hands up in the air\u2026 loudly yelling\u2026 \u201cVRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 \u201c I immediately stopped playing.. mid solo. This was a lot to take in emotionally. My band, all smiling with happy eyes and slightly astonished faces, kept rocking and grooving, keeping up the energy and vibe and drive\u2026 meanwhile\u2026 non stop, without missing a beat, hands or fists high in the air\u2026 a mass of people, most of them friends, acquaintances, family, confidantes, ex girlfriends, ex lovers, musicians I jammed with in years passed\u2026 EVERYBODY\u2026 \u201cVRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 VRENY\u2026 and in front of that crazy crowd of loving audience\u2026 right in front of me\u2026 I see my super lovely mom and dad\u2026 who I love so unbelievably much\u2026 with tears in their eyes, with admiration\u2026 the people I admire the most, looking at me\u2026 me.. their son, with the same admiration I feel for them. and I was absolutely\u2026 NAILED to the stage\u2026 immobile\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how to react, I didn\u2019t know what to say. For the first time in my life, I was verbally defeated and rendered completely speechless. Meanwhile\u2026 the band kept going like their life depended on it\u2026 and for the first, one and only time in my life, I had to swallow really hard or I was about to burst out in tears on a stage during a show. and I remember, when I finally got my composure back, and I felt I was able to talk again without crying, how I stepped up to the mic, and said: \u201cHeeeeeeeyyyy, calm down folks, it\u2019s just me\u2026 haha\u201d You would expect, when something like that happens, that there would be a boost or surge in ego, or self-importance, getting all that attention and love, but no\u2026 exactly the opposite happens. It felt the love in the room and I felt humbled and brought down to earth, like \u201chey, this isn\u2019t really necessary\u201d lol. It was an amazing learning experience. When I got my composure back, I just got back to the music, dived right back into my solo where I had left off\u2026 and the whole audience erupted into a loud loooong cheer of approval and happiness. The rhythmic name calling subdued little by little\u2026 and we finished the song. This is still my most unforgettable moment ever in my career as a performer. I will never forget that moment. I ofcourse still have a copy of that show poster and other memorabilia. :) ",

            "answer_text": "It had to be this one. I\u2019ve toured with a lot of great bands across Canada and the US, but the gig I wrote about below, is by far my most enjoyable. I will never forget it. It was the late eighties. I was not on tour at that time and with my own band, we played an outside concert for the sick children on the grounds of the children\u2019s hospital in our city. The kids that could come out, came in wheelchairs, some could walk, some had crutches, and some were even wheeled out in beds. Their parents were there with them. Chairs were set out and some tents. A lot who could not make it down looked out the windows. There were some children who were terminal. Needless to say, the kids were all very excited. We were happy to make them forget their problems for two hours. Even the nurses and doctors that could come out were quite thrilled. It was called the Children\u2019s Summer Fun Fest and it was in mid July and hot as Hades. Even my wife and three young sons were there. My boys were excited to see their Pop play live because the only place they had seen me was on TV as I was usually touring and away from home. We played songs with a summer flavor, and threw together sets with fun songs, nothing too heavy. Some of the songs we did were I Live For the Sun by The Sunrays, California Sun by the Rivieras, Ko Ko Mo, California Girls, Do You Wanna Dance by the Beach Boys, Hot Fun in the Summertime by Sly Stone and much more. We played for two hours and while we played, the kids who could, danced like crazy, or surrounded the stage to watch with wide eyes and smiles. Just seeing those kids having such a good time made us feel good. I could mimic voices and cartoon characters pretty good, and I could quite easily mimic the Beatles, especially Paul, Ringo and John. I sang the Beatles songs in the band and I could get Lennon\u2019s nasally voice pretty good. So I sang three Beatles songs that day, Twist and Shout, Help, and Octopus\u2019s Garden. When singing Help, I got a little choked up because it made me feel for those poor terminal children who were actually probably crying for help. After the show, the kids that could clamber on stage did so and we showed them how to play drums, guitars, keyboards and sing on the mic\u2019s. They just had a ball, just all smiles and happiness. It made us in the band very happy. Years later, I saw The Beach Boys perform Hot Fun in The Summertime on a video. It was an outside performance on the street like a street dance with people and especially kids just having a good time. There\u2019s a part where drummer John Stamos, a very good drummer by the way, has a small boy on the drums with him and the boy goes to bash the cymbal and Stamos flinches trying not to be hit by the drumstick. I laughed because the very same thing happened to me when I had a little boy on my lap at that children\u2019s hospital gig. Then I got tears in my eyes thinking of the sick and terminal ill children we played for that day and for a few hours, made them forget all their problems. I pray that every one of the kids got better, EVERY ONE! Would that be too much to ask for? Below is the Beach Boys video of that street taping. They do one hell of a number on that song and DAMN, the studio recording has one hell of a gorgeous snare drum sound in this song. Listen to that funky snare sound. This video reminds me so much of that day we played for the children at the hospital, minus the girls parading around in bikinis of course. But the children. If no sound, unmute.   Above is the only photo I have of that event. Most of my band photos were lost in a house fire. Just look at the faces of those kids. I took this photo from behind the drums between songs. ",
