            "answer_text": "White people as in \u201cEuropean light-skinned people\u201d, as in \u201cpeople with Caucasoid features\u201d, or as in \u201cpeople with any kind of light skin\u201d? In the first case, I can cite Moldova, Kosovo, Albania, Ukraine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Under the second and third premises, then I can add most of Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Turkmenistan, Iran, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, among others. In Latin America, white-majority countries like Argentina and Uruguay aren\u2019t still exactly worthy of developed status, despite their relatively high levels of development. Oh, by this moment you\u2019ll possibly want me to use the strictest definition of \u201cwhite people\u201d that could be possible, so that in the end \u201cwhite people\u201d mean only \u201cvery light-skinned people of Western and Central European ancestry and with little admixture with other non-European peoples\u201d. But, of course, that\u2019d be disingenuous, so I stick with this answer: if \u201cwhite people\u201d has still anything to do with \u201clight skin\u201d in a worldwide basis, then there are loads of underdeveloped white-majority countries.

Meanwhile, just below the 38th parallel North, in South Korea, the same people, with the same ethnic makeup were busy overtaking Japan as the most developed country in East Asia\u2026  But you might counter that only Europeans are to be considered \u201cwhite\u201d. OK, let's then talk about Eastern and Western Germany.  New York Times, 23 December 1970 East Germany is facing a new year of persistent food shortages and price rises for basic consumer goods, according to knowledgeable sources in East Berlin. All the while, on the other side of the Iron Curtain\u2026  I guess you get my point. Politics, not skin colour, determine development. ",
