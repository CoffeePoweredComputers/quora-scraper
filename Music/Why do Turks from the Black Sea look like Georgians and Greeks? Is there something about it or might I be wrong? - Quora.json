            "answer_text": "This question perfectly describes me. Because, as a Turkish person from Black Sea region (Karadeniz Bolgesi in Turkish or Pontos in Greek), I am ethnically Georgian. Georgian is the language my parents were talking to each other when I was a kid. People from that area are ethnically diverse. Greeks, Georgians, Laz, Cherkess, Armenians (Hamshen) and of course, Turks. PS: Some other answers ignore the Greek existence from the area but they are wrong. I personally know people from there speak natively Greek (\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1). There are Greek villages in the region. ",

And he accepts the reality of being originally Rum (it means Roman actually not greek) and he is a turkish Nationalist now :) ) I have been told several times that my grandma from my father side had a Georgian Origin which is normal. Because I am from Amasya and there are many georgian, laz villages in there. My cousin is half turkish half georgian. And My grandfather from my father side has blue eyes and very light skin. So obviously I have ancestors from many ethnicities which is wonderful but Turkishness is not about your genes, dna whatsoever it is about being a part of collective consciousness. ",
