            "answer_text": "I think it has to do with the audience of The Voice. What people aren\u2019t understanding is that The Voice audience doesn\u2019t automatically translate to the real world audience. Only certain segments of the population watch these talent shows, and you can\u2019t always bank on those populations to buy the music. The Voice had the disadvantage of coming up in the social media era where everything is inflated. Social media interactions/presence doesn\u2019t translate to real world success either. American Idol had the advantage of coming up before the social media era, and it was the first of its kind. Back then everyone was watching American Idol because it was the only real singing show to actually watch. That and American Idol solidified itself as a household name really well and with its judges. Everyone knows the holy trinity of Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, and Paula Abdul. Ryan Seacrest was always notable too. It was amazing and the talent pool was incredible to back it up. The voting process was authentic and actually reflected the demand of the population. One thing I find The Voice lacking is a clear sense of cohesion. They\u2019re always replacing the judges. It\u2019s too much of a revolving door. That and The Voice process seems to be a little too long for the average attention span. First, you have the blinds, the knockouts, and then the live shows and the team aspect. American Idol literally had its auditions, group decisions & Hollywood week, and the regular live shows; it\u2019s more simplified. With The Voice I find myself skipping blinds and knockouts or barely watching it, and then picking up at the lives. Don\u2019t even get me started on all the voting methods and social media saves, that\u2019s a whole other mess. At this point it seems like people are only tuning in for the judges and not the allure of the contestants. And again, it has to do with the star power. People watch American Idol knowing that a star will come out of it for that season, and are invested for that reason. You can\u2019t say the same with The Voice. Long story short, The Voice has yet to really produce a recording artist comparable with the sales of the American Idol contestant because it still doesn\u2019t have a grasp of its audience. Once The Voice finds that, it might produce a genuine star. ",

            "answer_text": "Idol was a program OWNED BY A CONSORIUM OF RECORD LABELS which is why the winners always had a record deal as part of the prize. The Voice is more like a VARIETY SHOW of amateurs. You may have noted that persons like SIMON COWELL being involved with IDOL was part of that as he was/is a notorious artist developer. I would add though that even though Kelly Clarkson & Carrie Underwood both had a good start, they have not carried over very well and are today down to 3rd tier status as far as billing is concerned. Considering they came from nowhere that is not exactly bad as they both still can get gigs\u2026. they have to work harder and do more that higher billed artists. THE VOICE is also less about CELBRITY and more about AMATEUR and is basically a national karaoke showcase essentially. ",

The winners of The Voice do not have a recording contract waiting for them. Recent Voice winner Jake Hoot was signed to contract because he seemed marketable. His album is due any time now. ",
