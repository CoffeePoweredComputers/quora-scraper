            "answer_text": "This answer depends upon how the term \u201ctechnical\u201d is being used in the question. If the question is to compare how virtuosic his technique is in comparison to other players, then the answer is no. He is not particularly notable. If the question refers to other aspects of him, such as his tone-crafting, improvisational skills, ability to pull off a performance at any time, etc., then he is clearly one of the best. He is more artist than craftsman. The area that I have always debated is his improvisational skill, which while pleasing to the ear, is rather limited. Clapton has always stuck to working with stock phrases and clich\u00e9s. He admitted as much when he was a young man, as being something of the formula for his approach. Other guitarists who traveled in the same circles (particularly Beck and Gilmour) are far more adventurous as improvisors. Clapton never really bought into the \u201cClapton Is God\u201d thing, but he did have a host of personal issues which made him somewhat unapproachable and unpleasant in his earlier life. He\u2019s dealt with a lot of that, and seems much happier now. He is probably one of the best ambassadors that the electric guitar has. At the same time, we should be honest. His place in popular culture has to do with his bonafides as a pop star, not a blues artist. As a blues guitarist, he falls seriously short. ",

            "answer_text": "Are used to live in the Quad cities in Illinois and got the pleasures of meeting Mr. Eric Clapton. Out of all the famous people I\u2019ve met Eric Clapton Has to be one of the most friendliest, amazing, special person and such a beautiful attitude. After meeting him personally I couldn\u2019t compare his music to anyone else\u2019s because when he is on that stage it\u2019s like he is singing just to you. The emotional connection you get from Mr. Eric Clapton is unbelievable. The day I went to pick him up he requested not to be in a limo, he asked what kind of vehicles we had other than a limo and we had minivans with limo tinted windows and a town car. Most famous people do not want to ride in a limo to draw attention. For four hours he had me to drive him around and talk to him and just no Destiination whatsoever we just drove, we talked the whole time he applauded the fact that I didn\u2019t act like he was a famous person and that the fact that he wanted to be just treated like a normal human being was so special to me so Mr. Eric Clapton I am a huge fan of, and you would think with all the music, the loss of a child you would think he would be in a depressed mood and even moody, but not even close. In my book he is a remarkable singer, person, and one of the sweetest man I\u2019ve ever met my life. ",
