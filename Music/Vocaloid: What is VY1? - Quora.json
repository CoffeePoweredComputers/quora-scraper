            "answer_text": "VY1 is a female Japanese Voicebank developed by Yamaha, the same company that created the Vocaloid engine. Unlike most Vocaloids, VY1 doesn't have a human mascot character created by Yamaha for 'her' box art- instead she has a fan, which initially was on a pink background. VY1's most recent release was for the Vocaloid 4 engine, and she has several appends with cross synthesis and growl abilities, called VY1v4. Her male counter part is VY2, who's represented by a wakizashi, which is like a small katana. She was the first Voicebank released for the V4 engine. Though she has no official human mascot, fans adopted a design and called it VY1 Mizki, who is a young Japanese women with dark hair often dressed in feminine, traditional Japanese clothes,  such as a kimono or yukata. A quick google for her on the Vocaloid wiki may help you find out more about her, and there is a channel on YouTube that reviews different Vocaloids, who goes by AtH, he does a series called Vocaloid Anniversary.
