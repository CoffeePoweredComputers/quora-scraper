            "answer_text": "Oh, I love this question. Here\u2019s my list: Literally all of Trouble from Jin and RM (You might wanna get holy water for this.) Suga\u2019s line from Cypher Pt 1 (album: O!RUL8, 2?) So not only is Yoongi a wealthy housewife, but he\u2019s also a boiler. This literally reminds me of that one time I told my friends I was as cool as an air conditioner. J-hope\u2019s iconic line in Boy In Luv (album: Skool Luv Affair) I understand that it has to do with grades and college being easy due to the girl (thus the ABCs since that is easy and \u201chakuna matata\u201d which means no worries), but this was still a weird way to portray it. Suga\u2019s lines in Where Did You Come From? (album: Skool Luv Affair) Gee, thanks for the advice on pick up lines, Bangtan! You sure know how to get the girls with your amazing words, especially you, Yoongi.  This sounds like something my 6th grader self or an anime tsundere would say. V\u2019s verse in the Boy in Luv Chinese Version    The whole song is really aggressive as Chinese, which makes it hilarious, but literally, when I showed this part to my Chinese ARMY friend, we both could not stop laughing at it. Half of the lyrics in there are \u201coppa\u201d. If you haven\u2019t seen this, you are missing out. RM\u2019s verse in Look Here (album: Dark&Wild)   \u201cYo my genie Lamborghini be my teenie weenie mini\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a bikini and martini, Mercedes so hot\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too tiring stop that eenie menie why\u201d I didn\u2019t even understand the lyrics\u2019 translation in English, but, you know, if I was a dude, I would totally use these as pick up lines on a girl. J-hope\u2019s line in Boyz with Fun (album: HYYH Pt.1) \u2026 Hm, that sounds very fun. There are lots more of BTS\u2019s \u201cWTF?\u201d lyrics out there, but these are the ones that stuck out to me like a sore thumb. I hope you laughed a little while reading this! Thanks for reading! <3 ",
