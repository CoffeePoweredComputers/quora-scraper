            "answer_text": "The credential gives you the clue. When I set up my therapy centre 4 years ago, I knew it was going to be the biggest thing I\u2019d ever done and would take all my waking hours, energy and resources to do. I would have to give up a lot of things, including any chance of a holiday or time away from home in order to make a success of it. So my husband and I created a \u201ckick the bucket list\u201d of acts that we want to see in concert before we or they die, or kick the bucket. This started on Monday 1st May 2017 when we went to see Steve Hackett in Birmingham, and our series of micro-holidays finished on Saturday 13th April with \u201cThe Book of Genesis\u201d also in Birmingham. I\u2019m due a shoulder replacement op in the next couple of months, and hopefully I\u2019ll have recovered enough to go to see Justin Hayward in September. I\u2019ve won a couple of tickets to a prog festival in October in Sheffield which I\u2019m looking forwards to, and I already have tickets to see Steve Hackett again in November. So the why, is that if I can\u2019t have a long holiday then I might as well have lots of little ones! ",

            "answer_text": "I love the music, that\u2019s it. Seeing my favorite performer/musician live is an incredible way to spend a couple hrs. If you love the artists music, going to see them live is amazing. I remember very well all the concerts I\u2019ve been to. For me, I think it\u2019s because I love music so much. Saw The Who, Ryan Adams, Ed Sheeran, Bon Iver, and others live (individually not together) and would spend the $100+ to see them live a second time. Money well spent. ",
