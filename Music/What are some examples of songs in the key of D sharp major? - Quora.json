            "answer_text": "I think you mean key of E flat. There isn\u2019t a D sharp key, C and C sharp yes - 7 sharps. E flat is sometimes referred to as the \u201cheroic\u201d key, Beethoven\u2019s 3rd sympathy, Wagners Ring Opera Cycle, Mozart Symphony No 39. Also Masonic associations. Loads more. Is Beatles \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d ? can\u2019t remember! The first song I worked out by ear was in Eb and its my favourite ever since. ",

            "answer_text": "D# is also known as Eb, and a few guitarists tune down a half step to use heavier strings or have a \u201cdarker\u201d sound. Stevie Ray Vaughn is an example of the former, and several of his tunes are in that key. Some metal bands are example of the latter. Eb has a relative minor in Cm, which is a much more common key. ",
