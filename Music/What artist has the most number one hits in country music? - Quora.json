            "answer_text": "I believe this question was addressed elsewhere in Quora, so I\u2019d like to mention that, especially in country music, it\u2019s the songwriter who crafts many of our favorite hits. It\u2019s like this: Great songwriter #1: Writes great music, but makes no attempt to have a career as what is known as a \u201cperforming and recording artist.\u201d There is a complex and ever-evolving social mechanism in Nashville, TN that is basically organized as follows: Aspiring songwriter - Plays all the open mic writer\u2019s nights at hole in the wall clubs such as the Bluebird Cafe. The better of these is usually doing demo tapes and \u201cshopping\u201d them to publishers. Publishers have \u201cSong Pitchers\u201d whose job it is to place their companies songs into the hands of the \u201cdecision makers\u201d who nurture, groom, and care for working performing artists. These folks do not have any song \u201con hold\u201d, nor have they any songs that have been recorded as a commercial release (demos are not for public consumption). Even if you\u2019re a well-known songwriter, the business works like this. Artist managers and musical directors (and sometimes the artist themselves) listen to hundreds of demos presented to them by already established writers, many of whom are staff writers at a big publishing house such as Acuff-Rose. Acuff-Rose had its headquarters on 8th Avenue South in the Melrose district of Nashville and was something of a landmark to those knowledgeable of the music industry. It was here that Hank Williams, to prove his ability to Rose, wrote what would become a major hit song (\"I Can't Help It If I'm Still in Love with You\") while Rose went out to a nearby restaurant for a cup of coffee. In other words, if you\u2019re a young indie songwriter trying to \u201cbreak in\u201d to the business, your competition is very, very tough. A friend of mine was pitching his song demo to a publisher and just as they called him in, Willie Nelson walked through the door. \u201cHoss, I hate to cut in, but I\u2019m truly in a rush and double parked - do you mind? So my friend said, \u201cSure, Willie\u201d. I mean, what would you do!? And true to his word Willie was in and out in 5 minutes. If your song is sufficiently interesting and seems to fit creatively with the overall vision, the artist\u2019s management might ask for you for a \u201chold\u201d. This means you stop shopping this song. Period. It\u2019s typical for very successful songwriters to have 2\u20133 songs on hold, maybe 3 songs that have been recorded by various famous people, and 1 song that has turned into a \u201ccut\u201d. A cut, which is a word leftover from when vinyl records were made from metal masters. It is then called the metal master and is the basis for all the records manufactured. After the master disc is thoroughly inspected, a metal mold is formed from the metal master, and liquid nickel is poured into the mold to produce a nickel stamping record from each side of the metal master. There\u2019s one more level a songwriter can aspire to. His song gets chosen, cut and placed on the record AND it\u2019s decided by the marketing team (usually at the record label) that the song will be promoted to country radio as \u201cthe number one single\u201d. That means this song is a step above the other cuts on the record. Two friends of mine wrote a song that Garth Brooks fell in love with and recorded. The record shipped platinum, which means the first order from the record stores, taken in total, was over one million copies. And although the writers had to split their end, the first royalty check was for $250,000. Each. Working songwriter - A wide variety of experiences typical based on how many years they\u2019ve been in the business. A songwriter who has finally gotten a cut on a record (his/her first published song) is still going to be found at various writer\u2019s nights \u2019round Nashville, but once you\u2019re \u201cpart of the club\u201d more doors open for you and you naturally need to cultivate working relationships with other successful working songwriters. Co-writing with other people has always been a commonplace affair on 16th Avenue, so it\u2019s very important to get your face (and your music) better known. The Singer/Songwriter - Think James Taylor, The Eagles, Jimmy Buffett. You know, those guys, right? Well they might occasionally co-write with somebody, but basically they provide their own material. The Performing Artist - They do not write songs at all. Their material is provided entirely by outside publishers and writers. Think Elvis Presley and Linda Ronstadt. Here is a list of 85 of some of country music\u2019s greatest songwriters. Some of them, you will not know. Some are household names. But there is a lot of great talent coming out of Nashville, which gives proof that with all the changes in technology, at the end of the day it\u2019s all about the song: melody, harmony, lyrics. Without songs and songwriters, there would be no music business. Saving Country Music\u2019s 85 Greatest Country Songwriters of All Time ",
