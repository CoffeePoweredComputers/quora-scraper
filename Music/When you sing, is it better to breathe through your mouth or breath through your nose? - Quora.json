            "answer_text": "This is a question that has actually gotten significant discussion among vocal pedagogues. There are a few schools of thought on this right now but basically it boils down to the following three: Nose only. When you breathe through your nose your larynx goes down, and we like that!Yes, it\u2019s good when your larynx is down but nose only can allow you to push down the larynx with your tongue. Inhaling through the nose and mouth simultaneously is the best plan.Doesn\u2019t matter where the air comes from, it matters how you use it. If you sing well, you\u2019ll be happy.So obviously this isn\u2019t really resolved, and voice teachers will argue about it possibly forever. If you\u2019re asking my personal belief, I\u2019m basically in camp 3. ",

A lot of factors are dependent on this one single factor and if your breathing technique is not right then my friend you will definitely be facing a lot of troubles. Now, it boils down if breathing technique is so important then what\u2019s the correct way to do it? Here it goes: Major part of breathing while singing is dependent on your breath control which means the control you can keep on your breath to affect a certain thing which in this case is the way you sing.Ideally, you can breathe from your nose as well as your mouth (whatever works for you) but you gotta make sure that you aren\u2019t stacking up air and aren\u2019t singing through your nose.If you do feel that you sing through your nose then here\u2019s a quick resolution for you:  ",
