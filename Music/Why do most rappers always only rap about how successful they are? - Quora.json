            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t. There are lots of examples of rap songs that don\u2019t mention \u2018flashy success\u2019 or sex and drugs, another topic that people commonly associate with rap music. Example: The Search, NF\u2019s latest album. The eponymous track \u2018The Search\u2019 details NF\u2019s fears, burdens, and anxiety, as well as his search for peace. \u2018When I Grow Up\u2019 talks about his plans for the future, \u2018Leave Me Alone\u2019 about his struggles with fame, and \u2018My Stress\u2019 about his stress (logically). Another rapper, J Cole, has several songs tackling social issues like stereotypes, racial profiling, women empowerment and the difficulties of raising children in poverty. Even Eminem has songs about taking advantage of opportunities (The iconic \u2018Lose Yourself\u2019), his daughters, endurance, expectations, and his poverty early on in his career. There\u2019s countless meaningful rap songs that don\u2019t just talk about showing off money and success, and to state otherwise would be to downgrade an entire genre of music based on a stereotype. Personally, I don\u2019t really listen to a lot of rap music, but I can recognize that there is an enormous amount of talent in the genre if you\u2019re willing to look for it. However, if you\u2019re truly curious about why some rappers talk so much about there success, there are a few reasons for that. Firstly, many rappers come from humble beginnings, and the fact that they now have so much money is proof that they were able to become successful. As well as this, it presumably appeals to a lot of people who are still struggling to make enough money by showing that it\u2019s possible to live a lavish lifestyle if you work hard enough. Finally, when hip-hop first emerged in the music industry, racism was still widespread in the U.S, and displaying wealth became an important status symbol to show off success in a time when African-Americans were strongly discriminated against. I\u2019ll finish off with this quote by Jay-Z from \u2019I\u2019m a New Soul\u2019 (who is actually one of my least favorite rappers, though that\u2019s not relevant): Rap critics that say he\u2019s Money, Cash, HoesI\u2019m from the hood stupid, what type of facts are thoseIf you grew up with holes in your zapatosYou\u2019d celebrate the minute you was having dough.

            "answer_text": "The main thing this question conveys to me is that you don\u2019t listen to a lot of rap. I\u2019ll guess you mostly hear top 40 radio rap. Fair enough, just try to avoid making assumptions and generalizations about topics you are unfamiliar with. That said, a lot of rappers come from devastating poverty, due to the United States deeply ingrained racist history and present. I come from a lower-middle class family - growing up, we weren\u2019t wealthy, but we got by. I never went hungry. It feels impossible to imagine how it would feel, as a child, to regularly have to go without food. I think if you haven\u2019t had that experience, you probably can\u2019t understand at all what it\u2019s like. What it feels like to know how limited your opportunities are - just because of your race, because of where you grew up. I was able to finish high school and college, with my parents\u2019 emotional and financial support. Poverty has not been a huge factor in my life - even now, at the poorest I\u2019ve ever been, I still know that in the end I have a support system. I probably won\u2019t become homeless, or have to go without any basic necessities. So to me, (and I expect you as well,) financial success seems boring, and I would feel embarrassed to brag about my wealth, such as it is. To somebody who grew up food-insecure, money can represent stability. The theme in rap of representing a poor neighborhood but flaunting extravagant wealth becomes clear. Consider this snippet from the Notorious BIG (who, by the way, rapped about an incredible variety of things, including his struggle from poverty, to drugs, to wealth;) \u201cWe used to fuss when the landlord dissed usNo heat, wonder why Christmas missed us\nBirthdays was the worst daysNow we sip Champagne when we thirsty\u201d I would suggest analyzing the lyrics of this song, Juicy, to understand the narrative he\u2019s describing. Try to understand the economic impact of institutional racism in the US. Personally, I noticed something similar when I lived in China - young people were very materialistic! Why was that? Not hard to understand when you consider what their parents and grandparents went through in the cultural revolution. Can you blame them? ",
