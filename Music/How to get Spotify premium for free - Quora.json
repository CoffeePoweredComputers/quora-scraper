            "answer_text": "One good option that I am currently using since 4 months, is to pay it and then get the subscription money completely back as cashback! In this way, the subscription for Spotify Premium is for free :) With the debit cards from crypto.com, your subscription is paid back 100% in their CRO coin for Spotify (and also Netflix) for up to 12.99$ per month for each subscription, depending on what card you choose to order! The CRO crypto coins are easily exchanged back to your currency inside the app, ready to be spent again! Currently they have close to 4 million users worldwide that use this payment card (with over 2 million new users in the last few months)! Other advantages from this card: Cashback up to 8% on all your purchases with your card depending on how much CRO you want to stake (realistically you will get 2\u20133% cashback) paid out in CRO.Until the end of September you will receive 10% cashback at Walmart, Just Eat, Carrefour, Tesco, Aldi, McDonald\u2019s, Lidl, Uber Eats, Domino\u2019s This promotion might even be prolonged after this.50$ signup bonusA real metal debit card delivered at home!Free airport lounge access around the world.Calculation example of your savings when you want to order the Royal indigo or Jade Green card  Suppose you order the Royal indigo or Jade Green card and you stake the 10.000 CRO coins. Let\u2019s look at different time periods and how much you would be getting back taking into consideration that crypto.com has the same benefits over time and that you have a monthly subscription for Spotify and Netflix of 10$. For the sake of the example, let\u2019s say that your monthly expenses on this card are 500$. Important information 50$ signup bonus: how to get it (or read my article[1] at the end of this answer for more info)Download the crypto.com App on App Store or Google PlayTap on \u201cInvited? Add Referral Code\u201d above \u201cSign Up\u201d button and fill in e2c2tt4fu3 as referral code.If you forget to enter your referral code, you can go to App Settings -> Referral Code, within 5 days from having your account KYC approved, to still get the bonusStaking: To be able to order your card (all cards higher than the free card) you have to stake that number of CRO coins. Purchasing and staking these CRO coins is done via the app. Don\u2019t forget that staking for 6 months makes you subject to exchange rate differences!Cashback you get is in CRO: All the cashback, so also the refund of your Spotify or Netflix subscription (which you have to pay with the card if you want to get a refund for this), is in CRO. However, this is easy to switch to your currency to spend afterwards. You can also choose to have the money returned to your bank account.This is not a credit card: crypto.com cards are debit cards, so there must always be a balance available that covers the amount you have to pay. So you have to transfer money on to the card in order to spend afterwards.KYC is required to apply for the card: crypto.com must comply with the strict rules of KYC (or Know Your Customer). So you must at least upload your name, your ID and a selfie to be able to order your card.See the picture below to see all the cards and their advantages: Footnotes[1] Full review of crypto.com and the different platforms",
