            "answer_text": "There are a few reasons that I have tuned down or up a half step or whole step. As a professional musician, there are aspects of playing chords that require the inclusion of droning notes that require quickly switching between fully fretted chords/notes and open strings (hammer on/pull off), especially when emulating my guitar teacher, Bo Diddley. Bo was a master of \u201calter-tuning\u201d. Though not commonly used, the term is as old as the hills, and is the best way to describe tuning the guitar to whatever tuning your ear tells you is required to make your application of the altered tuning as easy as possible, for example; I have a friend who performs a rehearsed bass solo. He begins the solo with his E string tuned to D, which alters his baseline because of the detuning. When he begins his solo, he plays the solo as if he is tuned normally, then quickly uses the fact that his E string is tuned to D, opening his style to more interesting note and pattern combinations, then out of nowhere, during the solo he tunes his D to E and really goes in on the solo. Then to add even more theatrics, he grabs his tuning peg with his hand in a \u201ctwisted\u201d or reverse hold and with one continuous motion, detunes his string down to B and insanity ensues. Now to the direct answer. The human voice is ALSO an instrument except, the voice is unforgiving. After several years of rock and roll singing, an aging diaphragm weakens and years, months or days of improper \u201cthroat singing\u201d diminishes the vocal range, or usually how high a vocalist can sing before realizing they cannot reach the note. If you play in a cover band, you can still do cover songs without too much change by dropping down a note or two to help the singer hit the high notes while maintaining the performance integrity of the guitar or bass (it is a little more complicated for a pianist, but a synth can also be detuned. By tuning up the same technique can be used to help a singer reach low notes on a song in which the singers voice cannot naturally reach. The true test of a professional singer is the Star Spangled Banner. Start too high and you won\u2019t reach the highest song note. Start too low and you can\u2019t reach the songs lowest note. I was taught by Bo to play in whatever key the lead vocalist can best deliver the song to the listener. So many guitarist singers play in E and A when they should be singing in F and A sharp or E flat and A flat. There is yet ANOTHER reason. Playing slide guitar means you have got to remove \u201cslack\u201d or string looseness from the guitar so that the slide does not contact the fret markers which results in an annoying clicking sound. That is why some slides have a raised bridge to keep the slide from contacting the fret markers. OR in playing metal, fatter strings mean a thicker, chunkier sound but in a normal tuning, say for jazz, the strings are too heavy to bend. Lower the string pitch and add slack (lessen the string tension) and bend those fat strings to your hearts content. ",

            "answer_text": "I write the vast majority of my band\u2019s songs half a step down. Personally I like the darker tone and it works thematically with my songs, not to mention it works better with my vocal range. When playing open chords high up the fretboard (for example, G# Major at x-0\u201311\u20139\u201310\u20130) you can get some great sounds that you\u2019d struggle to achieve when playing the same chords in standard tuning. If you want to go back to standard tuning you can simply capo the first fret. My favourite band Biffy Clyro have tuned half a step down on most of their songs (but dropped the E string to C#) since their fifth album Only Revolutions. They\u2019ve since gone on to have a stellar career which has included headlining Reading twice, two number one albums and more. Another of my favourite bands, Arcane Roots, only ever tuned to standard and they didn\u2019t last. I\u2019m not saying this is the reason at all, but maybe if their guitarist Andrew Groves was willing to experiment with tunings a bit, they\u2019d have come up with more ideas and possibly released more music. He also had a very high vocal range but when performing live would be under obvious strain, and maybe tuning half a step down would have been easier for him vocally. Some musicians do it out of necessity to save their voice when playing live, some do it because they like the sound and others do it because the strings are looser and therefore easier to play. ",
