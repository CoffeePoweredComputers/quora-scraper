            "answer_text": "4th finger is tough for just about everyone. I know gifted, professional-grade cellists who go to comical lengths to avoid using the 4th finger, shifting frequently and choosing strange fingerings. I've never been all that comfortable with 4th finger vibrato or passages, even though (in my estimate) my left hand facility probably \"carried\" me all the way through grad school. For the last 5-6 years, my fourth finger was also impaired by a compressed ulnar nerve (pickup basketball injury, not chronic). Honestly, I wasn't sure if my pinky sucked due to 1) being naturally weak, 2) lack of practice, or 3) injury - probably a combination of all three factors, and it's gotten noticeably better after undergoing endoscopic surgery earlier this year. Here are a few tips I'd suggest: Practice slow, measured vibrato and gradually accelerate (e.g. fit 2, 4, 6, 8, 16 oscillations into 1 beat), taking care to replicate the same sound with the fourth finger.Experiment with various hand shapes while vibrating with the fourth finger. I find that allowing fingers 1-3 to rise slightly above the fingerboard makes it easier to balance the hand than gluing the free digits to the ebony.Find exercises/\u00e9tudes utilizing the fourth finger for trills, left hand pizzicato, etc.",

            "answer_text": "Start by not isolating the 4th finger. Keep your fingers grouped together supporting the 4th, and practice long tones with VERY slow vibrato to build strength and control. Vary vibrato speed while playing one long note.  Do this for 30 min every day for 6 weeks, with different notes and positions on the fingerboard. After 6 weeks, start doing the same practice using just your 4th extended. But, also press the string very lightly, and find the least pressure needed to get a nice tone.Practice more control and a lighter touch, and give yourself several months to see changes in your sound.  I still have to practice these basics to keep control of a weak finger. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember having the same conversation with my cello teacher. (I hope you have one to consult about such matters....) There's not much I can tell you without seeing you in person, but try this: look at a good edition of any major cello solo. Study the fingerings in it. You won't find very many spots where 4th finger is featured at the top of a melodic line. It's inherently weak for vibrato, though useful in passage work.  Luckily you've got 3 other fingers to choose from. ",
