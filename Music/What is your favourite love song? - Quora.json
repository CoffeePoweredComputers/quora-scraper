            "answer_text": "Space Bound by Eminem  Despite what some people think, this isn\u2019t an anti-love song. It fully indulges itself in the immersion that love usually brings. It just acknowledges the futility of love the whole way. The hook blends perfectly with the beat. Eminem tells a sad and poignant failed love story with perfect flow and lyricism that makes you feel like you\u2019re feeling everything as if you\u2019re Marshall himself. He tells his story in a way that\u2019s succinct but beautiful in the rhyming department. We touch, I feel a rush We clutch, it isn\u2019t much But it\u2019s enough to make me wonder what\u2019s in store for us It\u2019s lust, it\u2019s torturous You must be a sorceress Cause you just did the impossible Gained my trust I don\u2019t know about you, but I feel this. This resonates with me on a metaphysical level. Being hesitant to fully trust and love someone because of how badly you\u2019ve been fucked up in the past? I feel that. You almost wanna believe that there\u2019s a happy ending in store. But unfortunately, this song is based on Eminem\u2019s life, and somebody decided Eminem doesn\u2019t deserve love, so naturally this ends tragically. The first verse shows the raging fire in someone\u2019s heart when they meet that one. That person who broke down their barriers and trust issues and became their world. But acknowledges how fucking paranoid afraid they are to lose them. Second verse ain\u2019t much better. This is when he gets desperate, but through no fault of his own. This fictitious bitch has manipulated Marshall to the point that he lives and breathes her. Until she has him dying, both inside and out. There's no limit on how far I would goNo boundaries no lengthsWhy do we say that until we get that person that we think\u2019sGonna be that one and then once we get em it's never the sameYou want em when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings changeIt's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mateI wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fateBut so much is at stake, What the fuck does it take,Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your facePromise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be making a mistake This is where I normally get hit right in the feels. Unfortunately he was making a mistake by caving in and breaking. I\u2019ve been there, and it killed me. Eminem\u2019s been through that pain, and he put it from pen to pad. Third verse gets even worse. This is the withdrawal point. When they leave you at the time when you\u2019re most dependent on them. They leave you at your absolute lowest point. It kills. So after a year and six months It\u2019s no longer me that you want But I love you so much it hurts Never mistreated you once I\u2019ll pour my heart out to you Let down my guard, swear to God I\u2019ll blow my brains and you\u2019ll laugh Lay here and die in your arms Drop to my knees and I\u2019m pleading I\u2019m tryna stop you from leaving You won\u2019t even listen so fuck it I\u2019m tryna stop you from breathing I put both hands on your throat I sit on top of you squeezing Till I snap your neck like a popsicle stick Ain\u2019t no possible reason I can think of To let you walk about this house and let you live Tears stream down both of my cheeks Then I let you go and just give Before I put that gun to my temple I told you this (GUNSHOT) This song hurts. Love hurts. Everything hurts. Everything in this world will not only kill me, but put me under intensely excruciating pain while it kills me slowly and agonizingly. Big big sad. ",
