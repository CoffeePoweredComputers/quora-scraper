            "answer_text": "The Black Sea has a lot of advantages: it\u2019s comparatively warm for a European sea, the climate is very healthy and the sea water is less salty than in Greece, no dangerous species, no tide. The coast is beautiful everywhere: you can find marvellous sandy beaches and clean sandy bottom along them or weird-shaped dramatic cliffs as well as small sub-tropical rivers flowing into to sea. Prices are affordable. But the water is less transparent than the Aegean, this is a disadvantage for snorkeling, even the name of the sea is Black, it\u2019s somewhat darker and mirky. And you don\u2019t have the abundance of sealife and bright colours you can watch in tropical seas. ",

            "answer_text": "Bulgaria might be good in itself, but the nature of Black Sea is such, that it is not especially attractive for snorkelers. There are no coral riffs, no tropical fish, the waters of the Black Sea are usually murky (hence its name) and if you are focused on snorkeling you better try the neighboring Aegean and Adriatic seas instead. The best sea for snorkeling in the EMEA region is probably Red Sea. ",
