            "answer_text": "A couple artists have done this, most notably Radiohead, Garth Brooks and Nine Inch Nails. Radiohead and NIN sold albums exclusively on their sites as experiments. Garth Brooks built Ghost Tunes to be the only online outlet for his music. The fact that none of them continue to do this, shows that weren\u2019t blown away by the results. If you are a major artist, building a compelling and secure web presence requires a much bigger team than you want to build and will erase a lot of your profit (developers aren\u2019t cheap). I bought the albums from both Radiohead and NIN, they experience wasn\u2019t great. Plus there will be little incentive for a major label to promote you if you limit your distribution in this way. Now you are spending your time running an internet site and not playing music. We\u2019re approaching the point where for people who consume music from streaming, they don\u2019t really consider consuming it any other way. So if your goal is to be heard by people, you go to where they are instead of trying to get them to come to you. Garth Brooks to Finally Stream Music, Plans GhostTunes Exit ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is distribution. Many artists have done this - Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails and the mashup DJ Girl Talk to name a few. The problem for all 3 is even though they\u2019re well know artist they don\u2019t have the audience on their site to drive enough revenue for it to be a living long term. Yes they get to keep all the revenue and it\u2019s a higher margin when you have less overhead, etc. but the fact is most people go to the streaming services to seek out music rather than going to the famous artist they want to hear and seeking out where the artist has their music. Also all of the streaming services have playlists and on Spotify for the majority of artists over 50% of their music is listened to on the service in places other than their artist page on the service (eg the playlists). So if only 10% or so of people go to an artists page in a system like Spotify to pick a specific artist, how few people do you think go to the website? Websites are hugely important for artists but that importance is about reaching their biggest fans for the highest margin sales. The streaming services are to be out there and reaching the masses. ",
