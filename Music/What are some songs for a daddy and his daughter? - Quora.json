            "answer_text": " \"I Will Take You Home\"...this is a song Brent Mydland and John Perry Barlow wrote for their daughters. Brent even sang it to his daughter, on Father\u2019s Day 1990 at Shoreline Amphitheater, with her on stage sitting next to him on his bench. Brent was the keyboardist for the Grateful Dead, all throughout the 80's, until his untimely passing on July 26, 1990. Barlow was a lyricist for the Grateful Dead. Writing dozens of songs that were written primarily with Bob Weir. Here is a quote from Barlow about this song: **\"The song I wrote with Brent that I liked best is the lullaby \"I Will Take You Home.\" I wrote the whole thing - melody, words, the works - as I was going up the driveway of his house. Then I sat next to him at the piano as he played it for the first time. It was about his daughters and mine and a promise I needed to make for both of us. That whatever happened, we would be there to take them home.Only Brent didn't live to do that.\"** It is a beautiful song! Here\u2019s a video below. Peace.  ",
