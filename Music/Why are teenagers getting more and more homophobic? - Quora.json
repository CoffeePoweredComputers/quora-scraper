            "answer_text": "Odd to have you perceive it that way. Most surveys tend to suggest that young folks are on the whole increasingly accepting of homosexuality and bisexuality, which is one of the pieces of good news that I hold onto when other parts of the world sometimes seem not to be going well. Some hypotheses: You might have run into a local cultural pocket where that\u2019s not true, and hostility or fear is actually increasing. Another thing which could be happening is that the standards for what one considers \u201caccepting enough\u201d have shifted even faster than the population. Another (related) possibility is cultural over-reach - as LGB has been tied to TQIA+ there has been some cultural pushback. In large part, broad acceptance of homosexuality has meant \u201clive and let live\u201d - not much was demanded of less liberal heterosexuals, other than letting non-het people live their lives. The pushback against gay marriage was a point of resistance, but in the end that too is an issue which can be resolved with \u201clive and let live\u201d. \u201cYou do you, I\u2019ll do me\u201d. But trans activists are conceptually pushing the envelope in ways that go well beyond anything LGB folks have asked the culture to accept - it intrudes into the mainstream more significantly. Sports, bathrooms, pronouns, etc. I\u2019m not saying those are bad, just that they are pushier than anything LGB folks ever asked, and if an non-transitioned human who presents to most people as male wants to compete with cis girls, it\u2019s not as simple as \u201clive and let live\u201d. So to some degree, LGB people could suffer some pushback against what the more conservative parts of the culture consider a LGBTQIA+ monolith. Please understand that describing a potential cultural trends (like the above resistance) is NOT to endorse it, just to try to analyze it so we understand it better and hopefully devise strategies which work in the real world, not just in the world we wish we lived in. We might wish that by combining LGB with TQIA+ the newly created acceptance of the former will be easily spread to the latter as well (certainly that\u2019s a hope behind the aggregation), but every association like that can work either way. Hopefully the culture will get there eventually, but it took decades for acceptance of homosexuality to reach current levels, and the others are expecting similar gains in a few years. That would be cool, but if we look at humans around the globe and across the millenia, sometimes culture change does\u2019t happen as fast as activists would like. And I take heart that most surveys nevertheless have shown increasing acceptance of homosexuality, and I hope that continues and also spreads to wider acceptance of other sex or gender related issues.

            "answer_text": "Do you have a citation for your question? I do, from the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychology as published in the US National Library of Health. \u201cFeelings of internalized homophobia are not consciously held by the young person, but as they face criticism, judgement, hatred and discrimination from peers, family, teachers or other persons within the community, this may cause homosexuals to feel bad about themselves and their sexual-identity. The stereotypes imposed by the institutions of society, culture and religion, create negative images of homosexuality and make the natural task of getting to know and accept your own identity a scary, difficult and confusing time for the adolescent. Internalized heterosexism which also implies internalized homophobia, is reported to be associated with lower levels of outness (Rosser et al., 2008; Wilkerson, Noor, Galos & Rosser, 2016). Until young people are able to accept their homosexuality and come out, they will continue to struggle with the negative feelings about their self-identity. If the young person cannot develop healthy coping strategies and cannot start to generate resilience during adolescence, the self-loathing created by the cultural and religious value systems may bring a future with extreme examples of internalized homophobia, such as living a heterosexual life, marrying an opposite-sex partner and even protesting against LBGT rights.\u201d So adolescent anti-gay behaviors are caused by internal emotional dissonance and an inability to come out to be an authentic person. And then there is religion, \u201cThe social environment in non-affirming religious settings, which promote homophobia, may induce internalized homophobia (Barnes & Meyer, 2012). Minority stress is associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety disorders, substance use, and suicidal ideation (Meyer, 2003; Baams, Grossman & Russell, 2015). A recent study offers evidence to clarify the complicated relationship between LGBT identity, internalized homophobia, suicidal risk and religiosity (Gibbs, 2015) while another study has found that religious fundamentalism and male sex were the strongest predictors of homophobia (Schwartz & Lindley, 2005).\u201d This report sounds a lot like my experiences of shame and lack of outness when I was a teenager. I have been a gay activist for 40+ years partially to insure that no other teenagers experience the pain and suffering that I did.
