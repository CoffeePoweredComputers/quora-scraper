            "answer_text": "I played baseball in my youth in the Netherlands, i can say baseball is not that popular, it\u2019s one of the smaller sports, mostly played in the West part of the Netherlands, in the South and North are not very much clubs. There are about 170 clubs with 22.000 players. Compare that with football where we have about 1 million registered players. Baseball is a lot played by the people of our Caribbean former colonies. Softball is also regular played at schools, so everyone know the basic rules and has some experience. The playoffs are also broadcasted live on televison but those are not on primetime. Also american matches are regularly on public broadcasting, especially during the world series . In the seventies baseball was often a site activity of footballclubs to entertain the kids in summer when the football competition is off. Famous players like Cruyff and Neeskens where talented players, guess who this kid is :) https://catcher.home.xs4all.nl/f-johan_cruijff61ajax.jpg ",

            "answer_text": "Among some Dutch people, yes. I have a Dutch friend whose sons are both very much into baseball. They were chosen to attend a baseball academy that feeds into the national team organization, and she follows their games avidly. So do many of her friends. Baseball has room to grow in the Netherlands for sure, but there are already lots of Dutch people who love it. ",
