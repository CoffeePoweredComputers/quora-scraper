            "answer_text": "Do you have a teacher? That\u2019s the best way: person to person instruction with immediate feedback on it. The exercise I did as a young student and that I give to my students to learn or refine their vibrato is to do single oscillations (I don\u2019t have the exact right word for it but if you were my student I\u2019d of course show you). One single \u201cvibrato\u201d followed by a second or two of no vibrato (keep the bow going). Then a single oscillation again. More no vibrato. Do that for a minute or so, or until you feel you can comfortably control the one at a time oscillation. When that is easily controlled go to two oscillations, one right after the other so you can\u2019t really separate them in your ear. Two followed by a second or two of silence, then again and again etc. Go to three oscillations. They are done as a quick group. Your hand gets used to controlling three at a time. Then four, then five, then six, and by seven you should be able to do vibrato for as long (or little) as you like. But even this exercise may not be successful without immediate feedback. Find a teacher? ",
