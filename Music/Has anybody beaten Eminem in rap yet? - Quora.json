            "answer_text": "Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists - Year-End 2017 As of 2017, 34 artists have beaten Eminem in rap. Eminem placed as the 35th best selling hip hop/R&B artist in the country. That means there are 34 people who have beaten him, by being more popular and better selling. Obviously that\u2019s not what you meant, but to be completely honest I\u2019m not sure what you did mean. Are you referring strictly to rap battles and beefs? If so not really, in that no rap beef has caused his career to derail. He did that himself. Are you referring to skill level in terms of flow and rhyme schemes? That\u2019s a bit more complex and less concrete, but I\u2019d say guys like Busta Rhymes and Techn9ne had him beat long ago. But again, that\u2019s pretty vague. At the moment, he is probably the most notable rapper who commonly uses that style. Are you referring to quality of music? I\u2019d say he hasn\u2019t been that good in overall quality for a long time. How long that time is a question for another day, as I\u2019m not actually sure of my own opinion on that. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s bad though. Sure, he\u2019s made a few monstrosities starting with re-, but Kamikaze did win me over in the end. But he is definitely not the best current rapper. If I had to pick, I\u2019d give that crown to Kendrick, but I\u2019m not certain. There\u2019s a lot of great talent and high quality music being made in the genre right now. But I\u2019m getting off topic. Let\u2019s bring it back to the question: has Eminem been beaten? There\u2019s really only one reliable way to measure it that isn\u2019t up to opinion, and that\u2019s pure numbers. Eminem is very much a relic of a previous generation at this point. Some people respect him for his contributions to the culture, but his recent attacks on the state of hip hop have turned many people away from him. The single worst thing about Kamikaze is the fact that it exists. No relevant rapper or artist of any genre makes an entire full-length album attacking people for criticizing his previous album, especially not if that previous album is as godawful as the one in question. I like Kamikaze but goddamn is that hard to get over. This several months will be a goldmine for future historians studying his career. Look, Eminem is fading. Sure, Kamikaze debuted at #1 and spawned several hit singles that probably won\u2019t drop off the charts nearly as quickly as the ones from Revival, but he\u2019s still fading. On one hand, I\u2019d love to see him return to form. But on the other, there is a point where you need to just leave things as they are. He had the perfect opportunity to back in 2013, after he dropped the Marshall Mathers LP2. That is his best album since 2002, and would have been a perfect way to end his career. Sure, he\u2019d still have some truly awful music to his name, but he\u2019d have ended on a high note. Instead we got Revival, which is just sad on every level. It\u2019s a terrible work of music, but also it\u2019s painful to see someone so talented fade away so clearly. In the end the only person that beat Eminem was himself. Sure, others overtook him in quality and relevance, but he put himself in the position that allowed them to do that. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if anyone has beaten the God MC Eminem yet, I really don\u2019t know. I mean battle rap has evolved so much and the wordplay and punch lines used by professional battle rappers are so well delivered and clever it\u2019s crazy, which is why they can\u2019t make a hit song for shit lol. I\u2019m not even aware of any battles the God Em was in other than with Nick Cannon lol and I still didn\u2019t listen to that one lol. I heard he crushed Nick Cannon though, Em didn\u2019t play God with and end Nicks Career tho. Nick ended his own when he decided to have kids with that crazy bitch. But if he were to battle Cassidy he would get crushed, Murda Mook he would get crushed, I even think Iron Solomon who is another white guy could give Eminem a run for his money and probably beat Eminem in a rap battle especially after listening to Kill Shot. Which I really enjoyed, I like Eminem anytime he has that 8 mile sound and that\u2019s it. The rest of the time I don\u2019t fuck with him because I don\u2019t relate to it because he\u2019s making music for you Stans to relate to and for you kids to like. It\u2019s when he\u2019s catering to you guys, the ones that refer to him as a God is when I don\u2019t listen to him. See it\u2019s not that I dislike Eminem, because I like him. I like him as much as I liked Obie Trice, Royce the 5\u20199, Joel Ortiz and even Bizarre I just don\u2019t like or can relate to the music he makes for you guys. The ones that make him the superstar that he is. Just because I don\u2019t like his music when he\u2019s catering to you guys doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t respect his success because that would make me a hater and I\u2019m not a hater lol. ",

Do you mean in critical acclaim? By that line of thinking, Dr Dre has a better average when it comes to critical reception on his albums. But let\u2019s look at rap beef. Not a single person has beaten Eminem in a rap beef. The only person to ever beef with him that\u2019s even come close to being his lyrical equal is Canibus. And he beat Canibus. What about on a track? Eminem literally created a term used to describe when a rapper got murdered on their own track. And since then, he\u2019s Renegaded dozens of rappers in guest spots. But I\u2019ll admit, there\u2019s been times when somebody has gotten the better of him. Royce da 5\u20199\u201d has been his lyrical superior on some tracks, including a good chunk of Hell: The Sequel. SPIN Magazine called Sticky Fingaz\u2019s guest verse on Remember Me \u201cthe only time a rapper gets the better of Eminem on the Mathers LP\u201d I can\u2019t think of anyone else who\u2019s gotten the better of Eminem on a track. I guess he wasn\u2019t the best on Speedom. So, to answer your question, it depends on how you judge beating someone. But in most cat categories, Eminem reigns supreme. ",

I will cut to the chase; I assume you mean in a \u201cbeef\u201d. Canibus came close, but after some time went by nobody cared. If you mean freestylin then yes at the rap olympics by a rapper named Juice; who was really blown away by Marshall Mathers. Now to be completely fair, Em was homeless, had nothing to go home to in Detroit; Kim & Hailie moved, Em had never freestyled to something at such a grand scale like the Rap olympics, and had all of 40 bucks in his pocket to his name (talk about pressure). Some of the \u201crumors\u201d I have read and heard about Juice were admittedly; that he came in halfway through the olympics \u201cfresh\u201d to battle. Juice worked at the Record store that was sponsoring the Rap olympics. Juice hid behind a camera monitor so Em didn\u2019t know who he was battling until a little later? Either way Marshall took an \u201cL\u201d and at that time angrily gave a tape to an intern for Jimmy; who in turn played it for Dre and the rest is history. Since then\u2026 Em has made it a POINT to not ever get beaten, and if you have beef with him\u2026 Em will taunt you on his tracks for as long as he lives. \u270c\ufe0f ",

If you mean in terms of lyricism, there can be no doubt Eminem is one of the bests lyricists hip-hop has ever seen. However, there are lyricists such as Nas, Jay Z, Talib Kweli, and others who are arguably as good, if not better. Personally, I\u2019ve never heard a rapper rap better than Nas did on his debut. In terms of commercial success, then no (Tupac I believe comes closest). However, to think that Eminem being white doesn\u2019t help him with sales is to be delusional (even he admitted this). ",

Battle rap is very peculiar in that you don't have to be the best you just need to be the most popular sometimes. I think there is plenty of rappers who could beat him. Freestyle or planned. Jay-Z, Joyner Lucas, Kendrick Lamar just to name a few. But Eminem always gets a slight edge because he's willing to make fun of himself as well. Anymore it's a respect thing though. And the upcoming lyrical MC's that could articulate the sentences to diss Em, probably wouldnt dare simply because they grew up idolizing Em, Jay-Z, Andre 3000, and Nas. ",

I wouldnt call him the greatest but definitely one of them. He did start out as a battle rapper and you even hear how he disses ppl on his tracks. His bars come out just like if he was in an actual battle. Imo I think if he wanted to actually do something like King of the Dot he would shred bars. I hear ppl say that his freestyle was weak on his old battles and with Juice but remember this is back in the early 90s. The bars aren't as complex as they are now. One thing about Eminem is that he is a workaholic! That's what made him so successful and since he dropped his new album STBMB it sounds like he's hungry again!!!! ",

That's why he's the undisputed champ of rap, imo. However, there are diff\u2019rent strokes for diff\u2019rent folks. If you had asked me who I thought was the greatest rapper overall, I'd go with Jay-Z for various different reasons.
