In any event, the majority of the \u2018lyrics\u2019 are Fa la la, so make of that what you will.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a first off. Secondly, you xan look at this from two different perspectives. One is yes, it is a traditional Christmas song, and it can be sung for any season you wish to be jolly in. Just by substituting a couple of words it can be sung for any holiday you wish. As it stands it is suited for Christmas and new year's day. The line now we don our gay apparel can mean any holiday you dress up for and decorate the house (Halloween anyone) for. Hope this helps.
