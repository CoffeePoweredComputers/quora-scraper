            "answer_text": "No, time is no measure of love. You can spend most of your life, if not all of it, with someone you\u2019re not in love with\u2014countless people have done it. For example, after documentarian Doug Block\u2019s mother died, he discovered that his dad had fallen out of love with his mom decades before and only stuck around because he felt obligated to do so. His mother hadn\u2019t been in love with his father, either. So neither of his parents were happy, and their time together was wasted time. Block recounted his experience in his documentary 51 Birch Street. His experience was enlightening (albeit sort of a bummer), because he finally knew what was behind the disconcerting dynamic he observed between his parents when he was a child. Block\u2019s father quickly remarried a woman from his past (his former secretary) that he did love. Although the couple didn\u2019t have many years together, those years were happy ones. The father got lucky. He could have spent his whole life without love. The quality of the time two people spend together is the true measure of love\u2014how much time they spend together that they enjoy. How happy they are when they\u2019re around their spouse. How much love, devotion, affection, and caring they give and receive from each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Love is timeless. It isn't time bound . I mean when your are feeling love the boundaries of time are no more there. It is such a blissful feeling that time doesn't exist for it . It's not about time that you have spend this much time with so and so person so your love is more. This dimension of time cannot judge love and its deep meanings . It's more about the good and great moments together and its depths than the period or span of time passed off. Love is such an overwhelming feeling that it's meditative and timeless in nature. Time belongs to the mind but love operates with heart. So it's impossible to measure it with time. And love and only love is timeless and the only hope to a human to take him on a timeless journey. Life is hard with that timely world mind offers and only love offers little timeless moments. The intelligent mind knows to grab it's timelessness this emotion of love offers. Two loving people when they are together they truely miss this time and are in a timeless zone. Fall in love and you will know, Time cannot measure it, It is only there where there is no time. Or when it is there ,time stops existing. ",

            "answer_text": "When you meet that person, one of your soulmate.. Let the connection be what it is. It may be five minutes, five hours, five months, five years, a lifetime. Let it manifest itself the way it is meant to. It has an organic destiny. This way, if it stays or if it leaves, you will be softer from having been loved this authentically. Souls come into, return, open and sweep through your life for a number of reasons. Let them be who and what they are meant to.. You can\u2019t measure love with time, only with timeless moments. You measure love in transformation.. The heart doesn\u2019t wear a watch- it\u2019s timeless. It doesn\u2019t care how long you know someone. What it cares about is resonance. Resonance that opens it.. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, it depends on love itself. If the reason for you to love someone is time bound, love will depend on time.  ie; think about, what made you/him/whoever fall in love ?.The possible reasons can be of two types. Time bound: Beauty of their body, health, money, status etc. These will change with time. The same will happen to the love in between. Time does play a role there.  Boundless : Inner beauty/ beauty of mind, personality, behaviour, intelligence, smile, care etc. These won't change with time. If these are the reasons for you to fall in love, time is powerless.  Think about the reason, you'll get your answer. ",

For example I use the love for playing guitar for measuring how much do I love other activities. The more you feel attracted towards experiences about something, the more you love that something. ",
