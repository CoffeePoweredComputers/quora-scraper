I know I've got around a hundred or so of them. Some are recordings I know, others\u2026. not so much. But unless you're looking for specific pieces I expect you should find the. Without much trouble. I would warn you off of one thing though. Even if you've got a regular turn table that plays 78rpms, be careful about what you play those platters in. Spinning some of them on the old Gerrard, RCA or whatever turntable you might be tempted to use. You can really tear up your stylus, needle\u2026. whatever you're using in those things. They're fine on those old players that are meant for them they use a stylus that's pretty much a carpet nail but just be careful otherwise.  ",
