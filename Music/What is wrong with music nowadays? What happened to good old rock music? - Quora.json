            "answer_text": "To see the decline, you have to look at the history. Everything in this answer is for the US only. In the late 50s it was a new art form, complete with screaming fans. In the 60s it became a business because it was clear there was money to be made. In the 70s it grew to incorporate many different styles which increased sales. In the early 70s, cassettes gave people a new way to listen to music\u2026in their car and with portable \u201cboom box\u201d cassette players. Thru the late 70s/early 80s, listening to music consisted of buying the album, putting it on and looking at everything on/in the album as you listened. In 1979, Sony introduced the Walkman and the way people listened to music changed, again. In the 80s, MTV changed the way everyone watched/listened to music. Radio began its slow decline. In 1984, Sony introduced the CD Walkman and again, the way people listened to music changed, once again. Vinyl album sales began to decline while CDs and cassette sales boomed. In the 90s, the industry re-invented itself because the MTV generation, that image and that style of music was no longer popular. Since the industry began recording revenue and sales in 1973, there were increases in revenue virtually every year from 1973 thru 1999, with 1999 being its peak year of approximately $14 billion in sales. During that time period, you had record labels which invested in acts, marketed acts, distributed acts and everyone made money. A fair amount of artists didn\u2019t make much because the contracts were very one sided. But, you had a handful of artists making a ton of money. You had a large amount of artists making a decent amount of money. You had struggling artists who wanted to make money. But, you had and entire industry; record shops, tours, merchandise, etc, that provided many different ways to make money beyond just album sales. Not to mention, many, many, people were employed in the industry outside of the artist. Then came Napster in 1999 and the industry changed completely. All of a sudden, music was available by simply sharing. Not finding someone who had the album and recording it onto cassette. But, by downloading a program and seeing 1,000s and 1,000s of people sharing their music from all over the world. I give Lars from Metallica credit. He saw what was coming and he jumped out in front of it. I\u2019m sure many, many artists and labels felt the same way but they were afraid to upset the consumer, so they elected to say nothing. After 1999, all forms of media that delivered music began to decline. Sharply. Revenue declined sharply. That meant there wasn\u2019t the previous money in the industry. In 2000, capitalizing on Napster, Pandora was founded (it began as Savage Beast Technologies) In 2001, Kazaa was introduced. In 2003, Apple introduced iTunes and artists and labels were able to monetize digital downloads (revenue was first recorded in 2004). In 2005, YouTube posted its first video. In 2011 Spotify was introduced.  Look at the volume, it\u2019s up significantly. Look at the revenue, it\u2019s down significantly. That trend has continued right thru 2016. Audio streams increased 76% from 2015 to 2016 while album and song sales tanked. The US Music Industry Crossed A Threshold In 2016 http://www.buzzanglemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/BuzzAngle-Music-2016-U.S.-Report.pdf In 2016, although not contained in the above graph, the industry is back to revenue levels from 1985, all while producing about 3x the product/volume for consumption. What does that mean? It means the retail price has plummeted. What else does that mean? It means you can\u2019t make money playing music. In pure economic terms, the industry went from some people making a ton, many people making something and some people making nothing, but an industry of touring, merchandising, record stores and other things\u2026to everyone making almost nothing. You have a handful of people who are using the tools available, such as monetizing on YouTube and making what they can with Google Play and Spotify. Who is making money? It\u2019s not the artists. It\u2019s the handful of streaming services; iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, YouTube and others. In fact, I can put my music on iTunes, right next to any Eagles song and we each sell our music for $0.99. We\u2019re all equal in the eyes of the streaming and music services. And, we are equal in that both of us make nothing for someone streaming/playing our music. What that has done is make sure that no new artist (I realize there are a few that make a ton, but only a few) can make money. Older artists who have a huge catalog and can get 25 million plays a month, from a 125 song catalog, can make some money. New artists who have a few songs and a catalog of 25 songs simply can\u2019t make money because they can\u2019t get enough plays to do so. Did you know Spotify pays between $0.006 and $0.008 per stream? Spotify's Year in Music shows just how little we pay artists for their music If I had my song streamed 1,000x in a month on Spotify, I would make a $6.00. That\u2019s right, $6 bucks. 100,000 streams/mo, it\u2019s $600. A million streams/mo, it\u2019s $6,000. You can\u2019t live on that. I can listen to 30 albums a month, as many times as I want, for $9.99/mo. That would have been $450 in revenue for album sales in the old music industry. Why buy anything when I can stream whatever I want for $9.99/mo? Why buy anything when I can rip whatever I can find? Who will enter this industry if there is no way to make a living in it? What you get are \u201cweekend warriors\u201d who make music a hobby. You also get less talented people who simply are not good. And, unfortunately, you get a very, very small amount of very talented people who simply can\u2019t survive playing music. What does all of that mean? It means overall poor quality. It means of a 1,000 uploads, you have to sift thru all of that to find the 3\u20135 good artists. There is no way to differentiate the good from the bad anymore. This is a matter of economics and it\u2019s not just the music industry. It\u2019s every industry. Pick any job that is no longer needed and tell me why someone would want to do that job today? They wouldn\u2019t because they can\u2019t make a living doing it. If you wanted to find a quality product but had to sift thru 1,000s to find it, most would not waste their time looking for that diamond in the rough. That\u2019s what has happened to the music industry. It\u2019s now full of \u201chobbyists\u201d who happen to not be very talented. In Shift to Streaming, Music Business Has Lost Billions Having been a musician trying to break into the industry in the mid 1980s in Los Angeles, I can tell you with the current economics, I would not play music today. And many older artists see it exactly as I see it. Neil Young: Neil Young Goes on Epic Vent About Google ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to comment here, we are living in the post monetization world of music. It seems all the new music has already been made and what is left is kind of like travelling bards playing their lutes with cat gutt strings 600 years ago in certain \u201cstyles\u201d. People who are talented in creating amusement for your ears. There has been a shift in the desires of the older music listener. I notice here that people seem to not be able to separate the making of music and the core tenets of capitalism. Capitalism is just as much of an ideology as communism, complete with it's own forms of propoganda, censure and violence. They say, that the sellable items must always be evolving in order for the system to work. But there is a limit to this form of evolution, much like atomic weapons are so violent that they are the only weapons that can change the will of an enemy to fight. After 50 years of monetizing the perfect hook it is no surprise that what you get are a deathly nihilistic youth and purchasable streaming of the sound of diarreah coming into your ears a la machine sex. And people just looking for some hand made rock n roll. In the Slavic countries they have had the genre of chanson since the 60s. A whole race of people that are in love with their gypsyish folk music forever and always. Nicolae gutta. Butuirka. Aleksandr rozenbaum with his guitar. Mahala rai banda. The late Mikhajl krug. Chaj vdvoem. An endless list of people just making different versions of the same \u201csound\u201d. These cultures have been around longer than we have by far. they have seen obsessions with \u201cbeing rocked\u201d come and go. The next Michael Jackson may not come for another hundred years, a man who is so powerful that he can single handedly move the hearts of multiple generations. Until then we just have ordinary music and a lot of it. Music seems to be more of a vehicle to cultivate the American celebrity, and the phenomenon of the celebrity has become intertwined with the production of music. These people seem to be an art form in themselves, the art of being a horse\u2019s ass. A product of our society like an ordinary thin laptop. Its not important what music he makes, all that is important is that he is famous for some reason and he makes being uneducated look like an acceptable thing. As if to say, maybe it's okay that black kids in central Detroit should not be guaranteed a full compliment of dedicated people to teach them. It has come to a head, at this moment we cannot speak of problems with our country as being separate from the music that we make. They now land in the same discussion and sentences. Repeatedly. I think people are angry not really at the youth and their ugly music. They know that the youth should have their own music to be young by, just as every American has had before those kids. But the adults are highly educated with regards to what the music industry today represents. Its so much more than an individual music exec being nefarious or whatever. The music industry is the colorful waving flag carried by the galloping mounted soldier of the corporate machine. A machine that can no longer be laughed off or ignored or called \u201call american like apple pie\u201d. The adults have seen the handiwork of this machine and know exactly what it stands for. They have even had their lives destroyed by it. And this music industry is now shoving it's highly evolved bullshit into our children's ears and they are buying it hook line and sinker. How dare they fool our children like they fooled us! Don't play them that way. And there's nothing we can do to stop it, it is illegal to be violent, especially towards rich people. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is right there in the question! Rock music is old. Pop music is young. It is the Peter Pan of genres. :) Western and westernized cultures have shown an interesting tendency for the past century or so: kids and teens often distance themselves from their parents\u2019 tastes. This creates a mechanism by which musical taste keeps getting pushed in new directions. So jazz displaced light classical and opera. Rock and roll displaced jazz. And then disco, hip hip and \u201cpure\u201d pop displaced rock. (This is a wild oversimplification of the history of course.) Check out this diagram that charts the trajectory of each major American musical genre.  [Image source: Gold Standard Song List, Graphic Images]  Of course if you put in some effort, you\u2019ll find plenty of great rock music made by young people. It\u2019s just not on the Top 40 any more. So you have to hunt around. If you listen to what you like on YouTube or Spotify, you\u2019ll eventually get pretty good recommendations. And you can explore AllMusic.com to find artists similar to the ones you like.  This year a pretty good rock album came out by a band called Parquet Courts. It\u2019s super catchy! Shades of Velvet Underground and other cool NYC bands. Parquet Courts - Freebird II  And in the past few years a truly bonkers band named King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard has been cranking out brilliant psych rock albums. They also dabble in jazz and African sounds, as this video demonstrates: King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - The River  I make some more recommendations at the end of this answer: Yohan John's answer to What is the difference between the current-day rock, alt-rock, and indie rock? Also see this answer: Yohan John's answer to Why has rock music been watered down so much to the point where most bands don't even use guitars when there is such demand for similar music to that of Led Zeppelin, Queen and more?

            "answer_text": "George Petersen\u2019s answer was fantastic, about the economics factor of music. So I will add from some other angles. When I started my music career (early 90s) there were several phenomena happening that, in retrospect, were crucial to artist development. One was cultural and social vibrancy. As a teen, there were loud neighborhood parties in the Valley every weekend. All of these parties had music of some sort. Either DJ/Rap crews or Rock bands usually schoolmates. You never see that anymore. I still live in the same general area and walk around all the time. I cannot tell you the last time ive seen/heard a \u201crager\u201d (what we used to call those parties). This system gave bands reasons to form, outside of profit motive. I certainly got a ton of girl interest from even mixing records at parties and later, playing drums at garage/backyard ragers. Now in the stare-at-phone era, that is a quaint notion. But YouTube views cannot compete as motivation. Secondly, there were infinite local clubs and venues in LA that would book bands. All you needed was a demo, often crude\u2026and sometimes not even that. This fostered a scene. I believe artists develop best with some sort of interaction with other artists and music lovers. The direct upload to Bandcamp or YouTube is a joke compared to this. Now greedy corporate/foreign landlords have taken over most of the venues and replaced them with outrageously priced apartments. This is the case around the US, and in London too. And lastly, it would be remiss to not mention the incredible decline in the public education system. Private schools have always been higher quality, but only a fraction of American legends have ever come from them so it is not important. Public schools started a long fall from even bare bones standards in the 80s but now are at shocking levels of degeneracy. The effect of this is throughout a very dumbed down society, but can be clearly seen in today\u2019s popular music. Especially the lyrics. Which largely are of a quality that would embarrass gorillas. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to know what era you believe Rock music turned bad, but what happened was the same thing that happens to every genre of music. It evolved, mutated, advanced. My Father was asking the same question just 10 years after Buddy, Ritchie and the Big Bopper went down in a field near Clear Lake. In 1969 the Beatles were changing the music forever. Syd Barret and Pink Floyd were dropping acid and letting everyone come along on the trip. The Yardbirds gave us 3 greats who each brought a new style to Rock n Roll. Clapton went back to it\u2019s roots in the Blues and turned up the volume. Jeff Beck brought Jazz to mainstream Rock fans. Jimmy Page formed his power trio and helped usher in Heavy Metal. Nothing on the radio sounded like what my father was used to. He hated it all, and hasn\u2019t bought a Pop, Rock or Jazz record since 1965. His last purchase was most likely a Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass LP. Or a Frankie Lane collection. Me , I love it all. The early 30\u2019s-40\u2019s-50\u2019s Blues from the Delta and Chicago. The early Chuck Berry cuts that electrified the nation. The Doo Wop groups who sang like angels on street corners. Duane Eddy and his twang. Dick Dale and his Surf sounds. Brian Wilson\u2019s California classics. The Yardbirds. The Beatles , Herman\u2019s Hermits, the Moody Blues, The Kinks \u2026.. all the British groups that put their spin on the Blues and sent it back to us. Though I hated the Beatles until Rubber Soul and Revolver were released. The early Detroit scene that gave us the great soul groups. Smokey Robinson and the Miracles still hit me in the gut 50 years later. And also gave us Mitch Ryder, and the Motor City Madman himself, Ted Nugent. The Temptations, Sam and Dave, James Brown \u2026\u2026..The Funk era , strongly rooted in Rock n Roll , but brought to us from a Black perspective. Sly Stone and his Family, George Clinton and his groups. Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath getting Heavy with the Metal. Folk Rock from Dylan that went electric and shocked everyone. Folk Rock that didn\u2019t and stayed true to it\u2019s acoustic roots. Joan Baez, Peter Paul and Mary, the Mamas and the Papas. Jazz Rock from Jeff Beck,John McLaughlin, Frank Zappa( a Guitar GOD!) Chicago, Blood Sweat and Tears\u2026\u2026 Southern Rock from the Allmans and Marshall Tucker Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Outlaws. Tom Petty\u2026\u2026.. The Allman Bros were still a thing until Greg died last spring. The Drive By Truckers are the latest group from the south to prove it\u2019s still a scene. Those Punks the Ramones, Sex Pistols, Clash\u2026.. You got EMO and New Wave and Electronic, Alt Rock-Alt Country-Alt Folk. Art Rock, Glam Rock, Hard Rock, Soft Rock \u2026\u2026 There is something good music to be found in any of those categories. It\u2019s just not going to sound anything like Buddy Holly. ",

I fell in love with those records at a pivitol time in my youth, when I was full of hormones, falling in and out of love constantly, and trying things for the very first time. That music can't, and to my mind, shouldn't be the soundtrack of todays youth culture. Why should it be? An 18 year old today is getting as much of a kick out of listening to Lil Peep or XXXtentacion as I did hearing The Prodigy for the first time. Music has always been progressed by youth, always will. What was the last truly innovative album by the Rolling Stones? Neil Young? The Cure? Either of the Gallaghers? Kings Of Leon? I\u2019m not saying they haven't release decent albums, but none of them is doing anything fresh or new. A senior music exec who I have the utmost respect for said to me recently, telling a 20 year old today that they should be listening to Nirvana would be the same as telling him the first time he heard London Calling by the Clash that he should be listening to Glenn Miller. The time difference is exactly the same. Seems crazy right? Things move on. They always will. Rock is no longer a predominant genre, that's just fact (and that's not because of those \u2018evil\u2019 record companies, believe me, if they could sell rock, they would be releasing rock!) 3 years ago it was EDM. Now it's Urban. 2021 it will be something else\u2026 All of this being said, there are still great new rock records being made. Just in the past 12 months try the new releases from The National, Kurt Vile, Gang Of Youths and War On Drugs. If this isn't your kind of rock or skews too alternative for you, then unfortunately, I don't think there is anything else I can suggest. Thankfully there's a treasure trove of Rock from your era on spotify/apple/whatever service. Rock is dead. Long live Rock ",

            "answer_text": "FIRST, THE GOOD NEWS: Rock music is alive and well! NOW THE BAD NEWS: It is not being promoted by the music industry or mainstream media, who are intent on trying to shape perceptions that other forms of music are dominant. Here is an example of what is going on in the media. You will see messages such as this: Hip-hop and R&B overtake rock as biggest music genre in US BUT one commenter on the article points out: \u201c..if you take a look at the report, you will see that, in terms of physical sales, rock still accounts for 36.8% of all physical sales which is well ahead of any other genre (Country was the next biggest at 13.1%. Hip-hop/Rnb only managed 12.8% while pop managed just 9.6%). This shows that rock music fans are still far more likely to buy albums (physical and digital) than stream them\u201d. Streaming works for music made on a computer but not so perfectly with music made with instruments like guitar, bass, drums and piano. Vinyl sounds much more natural for rock. Vinyl sales increased again in 2017 from 11% of units sold in 2016 to 15%. This trend will only continue. Computer-made music will not fare well on vinyl - it makes more sense to stream as it was made as a digital art form in the first place. As vinyl sales increase, \u201cgood old rock music\u201d will make a comeback. Go to any music store today and you will see a lot of young kids learning the craft with guitar, piano, bass and drum teachers. They are not learning Taylor Swift songs; they are learning \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d, \u201cWhole Lotta Love\u201d and \u201cBack in Black\u201d. They are buying record players and listening to classic albums while also listening to new rock. This is what you are getting from young people who play musical instruments:  The mass media have always tried to tell us what to buy and think. Sure, kids like hip hop and \u201cR&B\u201d pop but \u201cgood old\u201d rock is still there and can\u2019t be killed. ",

            "answer_text": "Something very clearly HAS happened to music, and that\u2019s generally, not just specifically rock music. The situation is dire. I write songs (starting about 20 years ago), and since I was a kid (I was 15 in 1970), until Youtube made it unneccesary, I bought albums voraciously and listened to pretty well everything -- and I mean every type of music, even the obscure, eg, Turkish folk/pop. As a songwriter, naturally I\u2019m interested in what other songwriters are doing. I want to hear musically interesting songs. Where on earth are they? There are so extremely few that I\u2019ve been able to find that it\u2019s not worth the many man-days of effort to try to uncover them. There is near zero attempt to innovate. Yes, there\u2019s always sonics. Way too much of that. It\u2019s how artists preoccupy themselves when they haven\u2019t got any interesting song ideas. It\u2019s great as a song creator from the point of view that there\u2019s a challenge that nobody else seems to be trying to meet, but a tad lonely. The situation has to stem from the impossibility not just of making money out of music but of getting attention for it: for music that is in any way not instantly commercial, that is. There is no business model for music currently that works, so very little out there is other than highly derivative. I\u2019ve not bothered to record as yet, instead focusing on just developing and building a song catalogue that might eventually see the light of day beyond open mics and the like. It\u2019s not just that as yet there is no blockchain set-up of some kind where artists can at least aim to cover expenses. Actually, recording, especially for a solo artist, can cost nothing. The related, and even more foundational problem is how to go about trying to get attention from the audience you\u2019re aiming for (if that can be worked out). given no decent curation anywhere to allow quality to float up through the gargantuan volume of the mediocre. And it\u2019s not getting any better. There must be hordes of songwriters like me, who write but don\u2019t, at least as yet, attempt to get their stuff out to a wider audience. Many more for the same reasons won\u2019t haven\u2019t bothered developing as a songwriter beyond producing something just reasonable enough to then encase in sonics, or which was never anything much more than a variant of the groove that is what the band\u2019s about. I remain hopeful that this situation can\u2019t continue and something will be done about it. Make no mistake. Something really does need to be done about it. If it\u2019s later rather than sooner, I\u2019m going to have an awful lot of albums in the pipeline. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are expecting to hear the music you like on the radio then therein lies the problem. There is no shortage of great new music. And plenty of artists are making money. Don\u2019t listen to people saying no one is making money. The consumer model for music now is to seek the music YOU want. No need to waste too much time turning on the radio. No shortage of streaming sites, music on youtube, etc. And while streaming sites are currently dubious in terms of income they provide artists, the whole nature of music-based income is also changing. Artists more and more are using the streaming sites - regardless of low income these sites provide - to get their stuff out there to attact loyal fans to thir band site/facebook page, etc. In the end it comes down to these loyal fans who will pay for something more tangible and special than an mp3 download, and who will help a band orgnize tours, posters, cover art, etc. So just find the music you like. Then find the band\u2019s website. Then buy some merchandise, maybe a CD with cool art work or something, or a CD with a track only found on the CD. Artists these days are quite creative with what they sell and this creativity and business/marketing savvy is how they earn money. Plenty of good bands are not making money because they lack these business wits, but hey, life isn\u2019t fair. Too many great, small bands making money this way to worry too much about the ones that haven\u2019t taken the time to develop business plans and marketing strategies (maybe that is where loyal fans can come in and help...). No shortage of success stories of bands using email-for-media widgets and other methods to build email distros, then using MailChimp camapaigns and other modern marketing methods to target merchandise sales to loyal fans. That is the new model that is allowing artists to have independence from labels and distributors - attracting loyal fans to their brand of music and monetizing it through creatively thought-up merchandise that loyal fans tend to prefer.

            "answer_text": "A few points. Point 1. Nothing. There are far more bands and musicians making music. FAR more. The quality of musicianship has not declined. It can\u2019t. If you have more people playing then by logic you have a bigger pool. Point 2. There is indeed a lot more shit music being marketed. But it just means the good stuff is not handed to you on a platter. The punters might have to get off their asses and go and see bands and explore the different platforms. We were \u2018spoilt\u2019 by only having one place where we can get music. Point 3. Bands like Metallica and Lars the greedy fuck made millions on a model of manipulation of what the public gets. Record companies manipulated what we heard and how we heard it and how much we paid. Now because that model has been blown away they are bleating. Stiff shit. The public decided that the model was shit. Full stop. And good riddance. Point 4. Good music will always be made because true musicians don\u2019t give a fuck about money. They are artists. Money is a bonus. I am a musician and have been in plenty of bands. It\u2019s no different. Play music people want to hear and work hard and you can make a living. Sure it\u2019s harder than it was, but that\u2019s reality. The mega bands of the past may not happen but so what. They never really should have been that big. I love old rock and new rock. And if you get off your ass and really listen and make an effort you will realise there is nothing better in any era. Just perception. With a touch of oldfartitis. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is that different generations tend to have different musical tastes, and that the music business tends to react to the tastes of the most active consumers.  Genres and styles tend to wane in popularity over time as each generation comes of age., although many will maintain fans long after their time in the sun is over.  To put this in an even longer-term perspective than what we usually deal with, consider what might have been the first globally popular hit record, which was the Italian opera tenor Enrico Caruso's recording of \"O Solo Mio,\" released just under 100 years ago.  This record sold tens of thousands of copies within the first few months of its release...an astonishing feat considering the size of the phonograph-owning population in 1916...and the fact that Europe was engulfed in World War I at the time.  Opera was an extremely popular commercial genre in the 1910s, and Caruso might have been the biggest music superstar of the era.    Today, opera continues to have diehard fans, but one it is obviously no longer near the center of the pop music world.  If one mentioned Enrico Caruso, one might find a passing familiarity with the name among some percentage of those who hear it, although it is highly unlikely that one will encounter someone who has ever listened to any of Caruso's recordings (although imitations and parodies of Caruso continue to pop up now and again...with most people probably not even realizing what is being imitated!) Eventually, the same will probably be true for nearly all recorded music given a sufficient amount of time, just as it is true of other art.  Most novels from the early 20th century are no longer read.  Most movies from 50 years ago are no longer watched.  Etc. Etc. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of good answers here. I\u2019ll come at it from a different angle: changes in the way music is made. Rock music is simply more difficult, time consuming, and expensive to make than today's popular music. Rock music always required at least three people, usually more, to practice and master their instruments, then come together and rehearse, then record the music over and over until it sounds right. This is an expensive and time consuming proposition. Today, it\u2019s possible, perhaps even commonplace, for someone to sit down in front of a computer and quickly produce songs with the same level of quality. Because it\u2019s become so easy and inexpensive, there are probably a lot more people choosing the path of least resistance - sit down in front of a computer versus spend years mastering an instrument and trying to find other equally talented people with whom you have chemistry. As a result, there are probably many, many more people out there actually making music than could previously. This would inevitably lead to some great music that otherwise would never have seen the light of day. But for every great work of art, there are probably 500 that most of us wish had stayed buried in the dark recesses of someone\u2019s mind. And taste being what it is, a lot of this dreck is inevitably going to break through. So, in sum, I think the medium that is changing the music. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is wrong with music these days. It evolves just like any art form. It may not be to your liking, but that's not the music's fault. Any style of music will grow if it has an audience to support it.  But when you say \"good old rock music\" what kind of rock music are you referring to? Is it the early rock of Chuck Berry and Little Richard? Is it the Beatles and Stones, or Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd? The Clash and Sex Pistols? What about Guns n' Roses and Metallica? Or Yes or Rush? Maybe Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chili Peppers? Or Nothing More or Kyng? It's all rock music, but it certainly doesn't appeal to everyone. Also, if your particular favorite style of music isn't being made or played anymore, it might well be that the artists themselves have moved on to newer things--or stopped performing altogether.    My advice is to take a listen to what's out there today. There are lots of great bands and great songs. No, they don't get the airplay or recognition they deserve but they are out there keeping rock alive. Just open your ears to the possibilities. You'll no doubt find familiar sounds and riffs that you feel at home with. ",

It makes you sound like some old curmudgeon that keeps saying whats the problem with kids these days: the kids are alright. Anyways, a important question to ask yourself is what is rock music? The easy thing is to point to the heavy guitar based music in the 60s, 70s, and 80s and say that is rock. But that's not true. I mean, I guess technically rock and roll's first iteration (rockabilly) is rhythm and blues mixed with a country sound. But if you think of rock as an idea, its rebelling against the older generation. It's about making something new and dangerous. If you think in this regard, then Hip Hop is considered rock. EDM is considered rock. They are newer genres, but with much of the same spirit. While Guitar based music is no longer the only music (and great guitar music that feels like classic rock music is still very much being made. Look at the folk revival that happened in the early part of this decade. Look at bands like Tame Impala recapturing the psychedelic spirit.), there's a lot of other stuff out there that keeps the same spirit. If everyone kept making the same type of music, it would go stale :D ",

            "answer_text": "Music is continually evolving, some of it in very appealing or innovative ways, much of it very superficially - merely pandering to shifting flavor-of-the-month popular trends. It takes effort to sift through the vast amount of music coming out all the time to separate the wheat from the chaff. At a certain age most people lose interest in trying to keep up with it all and settle in to mainly just continuing to listen to the type of music they already know they like. As popular trends gradually bring about changes to what constitutes the mainstream, you either have to have a willingness to be open to something that sounds different from what you're used to, or instead you write it all off and just retreat to the stuff that sounds like what you already like. I was doing a good job of keeping up with the new stuff until I reached about age 40. Since then I've stopped making the effort. It doesn't mean that I regard what has happened to music since then as being bad. It's just not my thing. I'll still get into a new band if they don't sound too dissimilar to the music from my era, but most of the stuff coming out just doesn't interest me. I don't blame the music. I blame myself. ",

            "answer_text": "Rock Music gave what it had to give. Now it mainly repeats itself. Rock music is like Jazz or Classical. It is there, you can listen to it, but it stopped evolving somewhere after the 90s. Nowadays, not a lot of people create Jazz or Classical music anymore. I believe this happened because Rock music stopped experimenting. Radiohead were the only band that kept pushing Rock music forward but that was in the 90s. Today, I get the feeling that only Pop music keeps changing and evolving (most of the times with unfortunate results, imho). Anyway, the problem is that there is a great abundance of \"performers/entertainers\" (ie Rihana, Lady Gaga, Bieber, etc) over artists (ie Leonard Cohen, Radiohead, Beatles, Stones, Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel etc). Nowadays, pop music is mainly created by technophiles (people who sit in front of a machine) and marketers following some restricted musical formulas with some drops of experimentation. People seem to prefer easy tunes and standard musical patterns with a heavy dose of performance (dancing, stripping, twerking, instagramming, the whole package). This is what I call Music for the eyes. On the other hand, good ol' Rock music was -most of the times- the exact opposite. ",

But do \u2018t worry, rock music is not dead, I see many people wearing Guns N\u2019 Roses t-shirts, along with Bob Marley ones, and other classic rock or other type of genre bands back in the days like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, And all those amazing, timeless artists. Just have hope in rock and metal, for I just need to understand there are other people like me. Another thing, there are some good rock and or metal bands today which is Alter Bridge, Poets of the fall, Buckcherry, And many others. When it comes to pop, some of those pop stars only just care about the money and have gigantic egos and become stuck-up jerks. As long as you listen to rock or metal, classic or modern, it will never die. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to understand this. When your favourite rock band of the late 60s or early 70s was making their records, they were making that sound because it was new, and different, and exciting. And because they were the innovators. They were the geniuses who invented this stuff. Seeking the cutting edge. But in 2016, that situation is impossible. Not just difficult. It\u2019s logically impossible. In 2016, you have plenty of people who can play and make records in the style of bands from the early 70s. But, by definition, these people AREN\u2019T the exciting and creative innovators. They\u2019re the small-c conservative, traditionalists. People who are either looking back to a lost golden age. Or too dull to have noticed that things moved on. And in 2016, you have exciting, creative innovators. But, again, by definition, they can\u2019t play music that sounds the same as music from 40 years ago. If you want to hear a band that sounds exactly like The Beatles or The Stones or Led Zeppelin, you can find a covers or sound-alike band that is indistinguishable. But you won\u2019t hear the \u201cadventure\u201d. You won\u2019t feel like you are blessed by, or in the presence of god-like genius. Because you aren\u2019t. So today\u2019s rock will never sound as good as rock from an age when rock was new. ",

            "answer_text": "Popular question: Why is there no good music anymore? Good music meaning everything before - pick your date. Notice that the date is different, for classical / romantic / baroque lovers it's 1850s For rock/ Beatles fans its 1970s. While many reject this common lament & label the speaker as an elitist snob, there are a few reasonable explanations behind this sentiment. Firstly, it's not true. There's all sorts of excellent music today, from all kinds of styles - if you know where to look. Mainstream radio & your apple music random playlist, is, obviously not one of these options. Another explanation is that there's only a finite amount of excellent melodies that can possibly be conposed & most of it has. Therefore, we must be nearing the brink of extinction of truly creative music. Thirdly, it's possible that given the low barrier of entry to musical distribution today (read, Cellphones & YouTube) any random untrained person can compose whatever they like, diluting the pool. Fourthly for the classical music lovers, (me included) some of them should really divorce themselves from the elitist mindset. While waxing lyrical about the complex harmonies of Mozart they must understand that virtually ALL of these composers were shameless populist, writing music that was designed to appeal to the masses of the time. The larger, the better. Also, admit that most of the music composed throughout human history is junk. Eg: Vivaldi composed 700 pieces. He is my favorite, but really only 70 of those are phenomenal masterpieces. To understand the mental gymnastics that enable you to ask this question, you must understand an inherent bias in thinking. Ie 2500BCE - 1900 CE is a long time to conpose lots of music. If you compare this to the last ten years, then OF COURSE there's far, far better music composed in 4000 years, (regardless of technology) solely because there's a much larger variety. Lastly, which bands (yikes) would I recommend for the listener today? For someone who does not mindlessly listen to YouTube mixes while absorbed in other activities, & instead judges each individual piece on its own merit \"bands\" are difficult to recommend. However on the sheer frequency of excellent music, I suggest you check out TSFH, Diplo & Deorro (some) , Lisle Moore, Melody Sheep, Rodrigo y Gabriela, & some Gerard Way & demau5. Now technical musical analysis suggests that there has been a continuous degradation in melody & harmony (richness) ever since the 1970s. This video explains it well (https://youtu.be/oVME_l4IwII). Now if you point out to me Justin Bieber & Ariana Grande, they're garbage. No melody, no harmony, no rhythm. (maybe a little rhythm). The idea is that the truly good music will be filtered out & the posterior generations will wonder at the incredible beats of the Cola Song (say) & not some daft punk junk. ",

A lot of the now classic bands continued to record and tour, but were largely ignored by the radio conglomerates & kept off of their squeaky clean \u201crock\u201d radio playlists. Once the on-air talent had no say in what they played, and the listeners were ignored by the recording industry's programming geniuses (an oxymoron). t's all over the world, if you know where to listen. Look for the music you obviously love in places that weren't available to us when it was current music. I'm 62, and haven't missed but a few days without listening to Classic Rock, Jam Bands (Grateful Dead etc), and all the other sub-genres. Pandora, iHeart Music, Apple Music, Google Music, MusicChoice (Time Warner Cable\u2019s Music Channels), and many more. Start putting together play lists song-by-song, and after a while, you'll have a collection. Old vinyl resale shops are popping up everywhere. Happy Hunting & Listening. ",

Why don\u2019t you listen to real music, like Benny Goodman and the Andrews Sisters?\u201d Sounds stupid, right? But that was the popular music of 1938\u2026 40 years earlier. Musicians today are every bit as talented, every bit as ambitious as the musicians of 40 years ago. But they\u2019re two generations younger.

The older bands and artists are aging out of the game and ticket prices are insane($700.00 for two nosebleed AC/DC tickets? Really?) I don't know where the original poster is from,but here on the east coast of the USA real rock and rock is making a slow but steady comeback. Clubs are hosting bands and the prevalence of music festivals is keeping some artists in the limelight. Ironically,people who have money to spend on music are finding cheaper ways to enjoy it and make it,while it seems record company marketing divisions are aiming at the dance and video crowd. Radio stations,with the exception of college stations and WXPN,have only played music that is simultaneously being aired on television as a video for years. This has destroyed some bands because videos are expensive as hell to make. It's the same with so called country music,maybe 10 or 20 musicians play in all the top country songs,and the artists are signed for the photogenic qualities,not their musical abilities. ",

Rock music is still evolving and there are a lot of new bands out there who are taking the spirit of the older music and putting their own twist on it. Here are a few new bands that I really like that show that rock is not dead. Blues and Lasers bring blues back into rock music. You'll love them if you like classic rock.   Unknown Mortal Orchestra is psychedelic and funky. They are constantly evolving and playing with sound, showing that Radiohead was not the last rock band to ever experiment.  Lake Street Dive are a soulful band influenced by motown and 60s rock. They're really fun to listen to and their lead singer has an amazing voice.   ",

There\u2019s been very little fresh or groundbreaking music in Rock & Roll for at least a decade or more. There are always exceptions but they\u2019re very few and far between. Furthermore, the technology has changed in such a way that making music isn\u2019t a walled garden anymore where it requires loads of practice to express what you want artistically. All you need is inspiration: see samplers, the modern DAW, and a whole host of brilliant designs:. Push, Turn, Move is an excellent book that explores this in further detail: PUSH TURN MOVE - the book Musical expression might be the best it\u2019s ever been for the thoughtful designers & open minded musicians who embrace these advances.

From the 50's to 70's popular music was largely the voice of change with lots of heart felt lyrics and great artistry.  Consumerism was held in indifference or contempt.  First in the disco era, then in the 80's dance beats became more popular than lyrical content.  TV news promoted popular acts.  Pop tunes were used in advertising etc.   Artists commonly advertised products. Massive sell out by many artists.   There is a reason that \"We built this city on rock and roll\" is considered by many the worst song of all time. ",

For another, it tends to be overly harmonically simple. And a third thing, it tends to be compressed to the point where it's a uniform loudness that is just carpet bombing our ears. And apparently, most hit songs are written by just two songwriters. And there are one or two people still writing rock and roll music, but that in itself has become a hearkening to the Past, much the same way that my writing music in a baroque style is, although the past in this case is a lot more recent.

There's more market for electronic music because people are surrounded by electronic music all the time. The sounds in which we live, the spaces created by technologies stimulate us to listen to this new kinda music. There are people who are born around acoustic instruments or just follow the legacy of classic rock or country or soul and they still make rock music but sadly rock is turning into a niche. There's positives to music making due to the developing technology because it's more refined and accessible to everyone but as a result there's crap floating around in the market too.

            "answer_text": "It started back in the 80's actually, I just think most pop music today that is popular on the charts is over-produced. There's just too many effects and auto tune is probably the biggest offender, I like much of the music from the 80's but now when I listen to it alongside one of today's pop hits, I really notice the similarity. That said, I definitely agree with Matthew, though, in that there is still plenty of good pop/rock music being made today and fortunately there are a lot more outlets in which to access it. It's just not played on the radio (which was also the case back in the 80's and on as well). ",

They were thinking about swing and big band, and even very early rock. So it's really pretty funny to hear it from my generation, since I remember it used to really irritate us, it was just another example of how stuck in the past our parents and grandparents were. Now history repeats itself. Both my sons are millennials and they have turned me on to some very worthwhile contemporary music out there. Sure there's a lot of garbage music too. There was in the 60s, 70s and 80s as well. Music is doing just fine, and in another 40 years some of our kids will be asking what ever happened to real music? it's all just noise now! ",

If you want to avoid the \"Top 40\" it takes a little work. One place to look is college radio. They often are commercial free and have a more free form playlist. The young college interns are very involved and and are on the lookout for something new and interesting. They frequently have online listening so you are not confined to local stations. Another thought is a music service like Pandora. You tell them what you like and they suggest other music you might like that has similar qualities. You can accept or refuse their suggestions, and those choices fine tune the suggestions and give you better choices in the future. ",

Popularity in music is based on whether or not the song is memorable, and nothing is easier to commit to memory than simple and repeated patterns. Based on that logic, as an artist that is trying to make it big, you want songs that are \u201ccatchy\u201d rather than good. That\u2019s why songs, artists, and even entire genres have become crap. My advice: listen to music that isn\u2019t popular, listen to indie bands, and listen to more \u201cunderground\u201d music. ",

When there are fewer people capable of actually playing a musical instrument there is less new music being created.

Today's music, in my opinion is mostly country that has evolved from a blend of folk, rock and country. The Eagles are a step from Credence Clearwater. Both are a folk/rock blend which strongly influences today's country. Rock is an offshoot of blues which is strongly influenced by jazz (same roots). Jazz has branched into several directions as has blues and rock. I expect there is a strong argument that all of today's music has strongly been influenced by early black music from the 1900\u2019s.
