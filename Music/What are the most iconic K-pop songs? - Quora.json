            "answer_text": " The word iconic is defined as being widely recognized by people. There are so many songs to pick, but these are some of the most iconic ones. (Note: The oldest songs are the ones on the top of the lists. I also don\u2019t want to add too many old songs.) Male K-pop Groups: SORRY SORRY - SUPER JUNIOR A classic, a must-listen for new K-pop fans. Ring Ding Dong - SHINEE To be honest, I believe it\u2019s the group\u2019s most iconic song. You can also add Lucifer to this list! MIROTIC - TVXQ! Some K-pop fans say it\u2019s a crime to not know this song. BANG BANG BANG - BIG BANG One of their very iconic songs. Fantastic Baby - BIG BANG Kinda like Gangnam Style, very addictive. Growl - EXO One of EXO\u2019s most iconic songs! DNA - BTS This was very popular and contributed a lot to their popularity nowadays. Actually just listen to most of BTS\u2019 songs, almost all of them are iconic. Don\u2019t Wanna Cry - SEVENTEEN The choreo and the song, a masterpiece. I believe this is their most iconic song. Just Right - GOT7 You rarely see GOT7 with a cute concept. This is one of their most iconic comebacks. Love Scenario - iKON This song won song of the year and holds the record for the most weeks at number one, from what I\u2019ve heard. Energetic - WANNA ONE The debut song of the first boy group formed by PRODUCE 101, very iconic and catchy. Shine - PENTAGON The dance played a huge role in this song\u2019s success. Love Shot - EXO Just listen to it and watch the music video. \ud83d\ude02 Cherry Bomb - NCT 127 One of their most iconic if not the most. The song is very catchy and the choreo at the end though. Female K-pop Groups: Into the New World - Girl\u2019s Generation They call this the anthem of K-pop fans, if I\u2019m not mistaken. Gee - Girl\u2019s Generation A classic. Nobody - Wonder Girls Back then, I\u2019d hear this song all the time on the radio. I AM THE BEST - 2NE1 Very iconic. Never going to forget this song. Bad Girl, Good Girl - miss A I\u2019ve seen many covers of this! Miniskirt - AOA The choreo of this one is really special. DDU-DU DDU-DU - BLACKPINK One of their most iconic songs. It also hit a billion views on YouTube. KILL THIS LOVE - BLACKPINK Their other very iconic song. Touch My Body - SISTAR Like Love Shot, just watch the music video. \ud83d\ude02 Me Gustas Tu - GFriend Their most popular song and personally, it makes me really happy whenever I listen to it. BBoom BBoom - MOMOLAND This song was played all around the world, it seemed like I heard it everywhere when this was newly released. Red Flavor - RED VELVET This was already a popular and iconic song from the first day it was released. TT - TWICE Their most popular song. Very cute! Others: PSY\u2019s songs like Daddy, Gangnam Style, New Face All of his songs are just iconic and popular to be honest. EYES, NOSE, LIPS - Taeyang This is like the When I was Your Man of K-pop, the vocals and the music video :O MOVE - Taemin A very sexy song. The vocals and dance, everything about it is hot. Gashina - Sunmi I could see people dancing this or making covers of this from left to right. Really popular and iconic. Gotta Go - CHUNG HA Just very iconic and this was just the perfect concept.
