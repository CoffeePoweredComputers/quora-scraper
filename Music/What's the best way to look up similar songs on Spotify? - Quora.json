            "answer_text": "See if you use Spotify Premium then there is an option called Song Radio. Suppose you like soft rock songs (as I do) and then you plug in your headphones and start listening to \u201cComfortably Numb - Pink Floyd\" and after listening you decide that you want to look up to similar songs, then you need to touch on the 3 dots or lines, located at the top right (whatever duh!). And then you see the following options  See there is an option of Go to Song Radio. Once you open that, you will find a ton of unending songs, (some of which you've not even probably heard of) belonging to the same genre, and also from the same time period. So thats all.. and thats a fair advantage too in Premium version.. Anyways once you figure out all this, dont forget to save and follow that playlist. And also keep liking songs which you like from that same playlist. So that next time Spotify will edit and curate it accordingly to your preference. Also there are other ways, for Freemium (Non-Premium) users, Firstly, You can follow the Artist Radio You can check out the related Genre You can follow the \u201cThis is ***(Artist Name)***\u201d Playlist So thats it. Hope you find it useful. Do give an upvote and share your queries in the comment section if you like/agree it. P.S: (Spotify actually has Song Radios for all the 50 million songs on the database , available to Premium users) Have a nice day listening to tunes on Spotify! ",
