            "answer_text": "Hey Gustavo! Thanks for the answer request! From the way you wrote your question it sounds like you\u2019re probably wanting to create a channel maybe on YouTube that puts out lyric videos of popular songs? I\u2019m not that experienced on this end of the licensing game but from the dealings that I\u2019ve had it can cost anywhere from a couple hundred to upwards in the thousands. It depends on the song. The best place to start with your inquiries would be to the Harry Fox Agency (HFA) and Rumblefish (About Rumblefish - rumblefish.com). Both are owned by SESAC the performing rights organization. They handle licensing projects that are in line with what you are doing. They would be the best people to get in contact with to get exact pricing on the songs you want to use. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "How much does a car cost? There is no one answer. You pay for value and your pay for what your use is going to be. It costs more for a major blockbuster like Guardians of the Galaxy to use a song than it does for a short film that will only ever see the festival circuit. And a Beyonce song has more value than some indie band that hasn\u2019t toured in 18 years. ",
