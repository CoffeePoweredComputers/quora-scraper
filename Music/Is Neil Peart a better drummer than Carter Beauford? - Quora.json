            "answer_text": "Man that\u2019s a tough one. I love them both; though I emphatically enjoy Rush\u2019s music infinitely more than DMB\u2019s. Emphatically. And infinitely. Emphatically. <ahem> Music, being subjective, personal and interpretive like it is; can be hard to break down into \u201cbetter\u201d and \u201cbest\u201ds. But to even attempt to do that one would have to look at some sort of empirical data; some fact-based, hard-lined skill set that can be measured and calculated. That being said, I\u2019ve heard Neil do some stuff that I\u2019ve never heard Carter do; but still, that doesn\u2019t mean Carter can\u2019t do it if he wants to. He just doesn\u2019t. Now THAT being said, if a person CAN do something, are they obligated to in order to prove their value or worth? Of course not; but it helps when attempting to define a quantitative degree of \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d. I mean\u2026.Lars Ulrich might be able to play circles around Mike Portnoy; but somehow, given the audible record of their work - I doubt it. So, going by what I\u2019ve heard; which is the only record I have; I have to surmise that Peart is better than Beauford; simply due to the fact that I\u2019ve heard Peart piece together more complex and creative things than Beauford has. He might not have as much \u201csoul\u201d or \u201cpassion\u201d or \u201cemotion\u201d; so some might disagree with me solely on that observation alone; but to me that\u2019s something so personal and interpretive that it can\u2019t be measured empirically; so it\u2019s a moot point.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s impossible to say because there\u2019s nothing obvious as evidence. A big part of the problem is that the two bands\u2019 music is so different. We haven\u2019t had a chance to hear Peart in a band like Dave Matthews Band, nor have we heard Beauford in a progressive-rock band like Rush. Plus, Beauford plays in more of an ensemble whereas Peart is in a three-piece, which means he has more room to display his skills. \u201cBetter drummer\u201d is also a problematic term because what are we basing it on? Peart absolutely does not have the feel to his drumming that Beauford does. There\u2019s a casually impressive nature to Beauford\u2019s playing that I really do love; he makes it look effortless. But then you really pay attention, and you\u2019re like, damn! Peart, on the other hand, always looks like he\u2019s working so hard and rarely looks like he\u2019s having fun. This makes for a very constrictive-feeling performance. Does this all come really easy to Beauford, and thus he\u2019s a better drummer? Or is Peart\u2019s drumming so much harder that he has to perform with such concentration? Or is neither assumption correct? Last, and the biggest problem with comparing drummers, is that we only know what they\u2019ve demonstrated. This goes back to my first point about the differences in the bands\u2019 music. Just because Phil Rudd of AC/DC, for example, never plays anything even remotely complex doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t. And sometimes the music belies a more talented drummer than you\u2019d realize (e.g., Roger Taylor of Duran Duran). One mark of a great drummer is that they know exactly what to play for the music/band they\u2019re a part of\u2026 no more, no less. I like to say this is one difference between a drummer and someone who plays the drums. Thanks for the A2A! [Answered: Is Neil Peart a better drummer than Carter Beauford?] ",
