            "answer_text": "Go second-hand for this budget. You still need to do the same research into which digital pianos will work for you but as other people have suggested, Casio Privia, Yamaha\u2019s lower range digital pianos or their Clavinova range are all good options. For a first digital piano you don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles or fancy \u2018Supernatural\u2019 algorithms that the fancier models have to ensure an authentic piano feel and sound\u2026 at the simplest form you need a handful of piano sounds (most commonly three) and some weighted keys. Semi- or full- both will do. Second-hand will allow you to get a better model for your budget - and honestly, as long as you stick to models that aren\u2019t more than perhaps five years old, then there\u2019s little that can really go wrong with them - digital pianos are built to be relatively robust. The electronics working are the main thing (ie has not been treated with a glass of water down the insides), so request a demo video from the seller if it\u2019s online, or better yet test the product before you hand over your cash. People put too much emphasis on getting a fancy keyboard upfront but the best thing in my opinion is to start simple. As your skill progresses, so will your taste in piano sounds and by the time you get to your next step up in a keyboard you should have a better idea of your tastes of feel and tone. If you want to know more please come over to my dedicated facebook group \u2018Let\u2019s Talk Piano\u2019. I have a ton of Q&As available for you to get amongst and can answer other questions you might have too. ",
