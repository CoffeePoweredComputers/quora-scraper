            "answer_text": "In general, you don\u2019t. Except for rare exceptions (when a brand might hold a contest for consumers to submit ideas), commercials are developed by a brand\u2019s advertising agency. They\u2019re paying millions of dollars a year for this service. And similar to how movie studios don\u2019t accept unsolicited ideas, neither do brands or agencies \u2014 if they had already been developing a similar idea, or do so totally unrelatedly in the future, you could sue them, so there\u2019s a blanket ban on unsolicited material. If you have these kinds of ideas often, the best route would be to develop a relationship with an agency \u2013 as a freelancer, if nothing else. You\u2019ll probably find there\u2019s a lot more that goes into it than just one good idea, from understanding the business\u2019 goals and audience targets, to where and how the ad is distributed. Or, if you\u2019re really passionate about this one idea, make it yourself and put it on YouTube \u2014 you probably have most of what you need right in your smartphone. If you make enough of them, and they\u2019re well received, that\u2019s a great way to get hired on a freelance basis by a brand or agency. ",
