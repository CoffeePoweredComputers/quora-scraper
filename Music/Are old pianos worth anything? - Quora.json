            "answer_text": "Great question. My display advert for used pianos ran continuously in the local newspapers for more than a decade. I also scoured the classified ads in the same papers looking for advertised pianos to buy. My business was to buy, pay a great technician to recondition, a great polisher to refinish, and to resell pianos that would be good musical instruments. What people think is valuable, and what actually is valuable, are two very different things. Beautiful Casework. Perceived value: Very high. Pianos are an imposing piece of furniture, so people think if they have one with gorgeous woodwork, impressive carved designs, craftsman-turned legs, wondrous inlay work - and a really well-looked-after polished finish\u2026 well, that MUST be a desirable item. It\u2019s a beautiful piano! Famous previous owner. Perceived value: Depends who the owner was/is. If the celebrity of the previous owner is current, there\u2019s some idea that a premium should be added to the price, much like it is with one of John Lennon\u2019s guitars. Famous brand. Perceived value: Medium to high. People who own a Steinway, a Bechstein, a B\u00f6sendorfer, a Bl\u00fcthner and so on, will expect a much higher price for their instrument when selling it. Let\u2019s deal with those three. Not one of them matters at all unless the darn thing is tunable to concert pitch, will hold the tuning, has all the keys level and responding properly to touch, and hammers all still present (believe me, some people think a few missing hammers doesn\u2019t matter) with a fully working modern action (i.e. overstrung/underdamper for an upright model) an iron frame, and a soundboard that\u2019s in one piece without cracks you can shine a torch through. At the other end of the scale (sorry) I must mention there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cIdeal for a beginner!\u201d. That gives me a headache. What people mean by that is \u201cJust about usable\u2026 mostly\u2026 and really cheap\u201d. Unless the instrument is near perfection it is definitively NOT suitable for ANY player no matter what their standard. Would you learn to pass your driving test in a 1914 jalopy with a crank starter, hand throttle, hand-operated friction brakes and no reverse gear? Most pianos I inspected on invitation from excited owners who assured me they were beautiful instruments whose most recent user had just narrowly failed to become a concert pianist were fit for the dump. The good ones, that fitted the criteria given above, I purchased for a reasonable sum of money, spent the same money on sorting out, and resold for about 25% profit. Some were very old. Most were quite modern. There are 100-year-old pianos that have been marvellously well maintained and are in perfect mechanical condition as well as being a thing of beauty. They are worth good money. There are far more 100-year-old pianos in a beautiful case with one of those previously mentioned names on the front that are worth far less than the cost of a drab looking piano that\u2019s 20 years old. Buy the drab one. TLDR: Value is often in the eye of the beholder, but with musical instruments, it\u2019s in the report of a well-qualified instrument technician. Until you\u2019ve had it inspected by one, assume it\u2019s worthless. ",

            "answer_text": "Old pianos, such as classic old uprights and grands from the 1910s to the 1950s were well designed, well built from good materials and have character and historical value. Unfortunately, they also usually require a lot of repairs and restoration to make them play as well as a newer instrument. When the cost of the repairs exceeds the market value of the piano or the cost of an inexpensive new one then the old piano becomes nearly worthless. I have seen countless wonderful old uprights with beautiful wood, often carving, great string scales, lots of history and character but unwanted by anyone in the market for a piano and destined for the dump. If the piano has sentimental value or interesting cabinetry or an excellent tone then you might consider restoring it (within limits), otherwise, let it go. We all age. Accept that instruments have a lifespan and move on. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how well the old piano has been maintained. Sadly, because pianos are so heavy, and need regular tuning and maintenance, they are becoming the specialty of musicians and purists. Beginners often choose electronic for practicality. Have a good tuner to look over an old piano to inspect its condition. ",
