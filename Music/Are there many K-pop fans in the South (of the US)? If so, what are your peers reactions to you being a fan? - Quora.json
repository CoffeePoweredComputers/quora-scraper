I have a group of friends who haven\u2019t seen our teen years in decades - we\u2019ve got grown children, are even grandmothers LOL My friends (& my family) are tolerant. They\u2019ve seen me with weird tastes all my life. I\u2019m a witch, a beledi dancer, an anime & SF fan, love fantasy (Tolkien), a member(former) of the SCA, a costumer (yep, predating this new-fangled cosplay thing), loved the Beatles in my teens, loved Zeppelin in my 20s (oh still DO love both groups) - etc etc etc I\u2019m also a collector of BJDs\u2026 So me loving Korean dramas and music is just one more thing LOL ",

So when this K-pop phenomenon blew up, it was just a matter of time that more and more people will be curious. When my non-kpop friends found out, they thought I was cute and were amused of me singing to Korean songs. ",
