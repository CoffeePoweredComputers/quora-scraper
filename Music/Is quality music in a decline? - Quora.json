            "answer_text": "\u201cIn a decline \u201c in what time segment? In the past year? The past ten years? The past 40 years? Personally speaking as a guy who has been critically listening to, and professionally performing, an enormously wide gamut of styles over the past 45 years, and on audiophile grade equipment in professionally tuned listening rooms, I can only give you my opinion. 1- The quality of recording & playback technology is absolutely staggering. Listening to remastered classic recordings in lossless digital format is breathtaking. I recently heard a pirated copy of Dark Side of the Moon in 5.1 DTS FLAC. It's as if you're sitting in the studio with the band. It's actually TOO CLEAR (!) because you can hear every little glitch, every punch-in, uneven fader jumps, compression pumping\u2026etc. Anyway, I feel extremely fortunate to be living in this era of ultra sophisticated audio technology. 2- The quality of musicianship has declined. And I think you'll find that I'm not alone in this opinion. If you could analyze and grade a musician with the same level of stats as you can professional athletes, I've no doubt that the overall \u201cintegrity score\u201d of musicians has been steadily dropping since 1975. It's not that musicians are getting dumber, they're getting lazier. They have learned to rely on technology to accommodate and compensate for their lack of hard earned precision and execution. In the old days, you actually had to be able to sing to put the lead vocals on a recording. Now you do your best, and let a mothership of digital processors and a producer sculpt your performance into a completely flawless recording. Every instrument has equal opportunity to be run through the magic of digital audio workstations. Now the only thing you actually need to make an album is a laptop. Talent is totally optional. That's not to say that there's no more gifted and talented musicians in the world. It's just hard to find them. Especially since shitty musicians have a massive wall of technology to hide all their shortcomings. In the end, it all starts to sound the same. No, I'm not some old dude stuck in the 1970s. I listen to plenty of current music and can appreciate the effort that goes into the production process. But, it all sounds like microwaved white bread to me. ",

            "answer_text": "No, quality music isn\u2019t in decline. There is a lot of it out there, but one has to dig to find it, I call it the catacombs of YouTube. I could spend days in there going through what I deem good music. The sad thing is most of it will never see the light of day! Musicians and performers still make good music, what seems to be declining is the listenership, and the way music business now operates. The new music biz model hasn\u2019t fully developed yet, it\u2019s still a work in progress. People aren\u2019t buying music as much, now they download it on their phone and listen where ever they go. I don\u2019t know enough about that method to speak intelligently about it, but I know they aren\u2019t buying music. Streaming pays tenths on the cent per stream, who can afford to be a musician at those rates? Back to your question, quality music is still out there, quality exposure for that music isn\u2019t. Digital changed the music biz along with several other business models. Be thankful there are still quality musicians doing good music, when you stumble across some good music let it be known, tout the hell out of it! That\u2019s how you insure that quality music will survive the drought. I have found numerous bands in the catacombs of YouTube, YouTube sees my listening habits and refers me to more. There are quite a few more digital outlets to use as well. I\u2019m partial to YouTube for the moment, they\u2019ve done an incredible job of turning me onto some good stuff. Putting my money where my mouth is here are a few recent discoveries of folks doing quality music. Larkin Poe, Janet Devlin, Tessa Violet, Lindsey Stirling, First Aid Kit, The Steel Drivers, The Walk Abouts, Cranford Hollow, and there are many more. I would suggest doing yourself a favor and checking some of these out. If you\u2019re like those I encounter you won\u2019t, it\u2019s too much work or something. None the less you have now been enlightened, good luck! Robert ",
