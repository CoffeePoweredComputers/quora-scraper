            "answer_text": "\u201cSomeone To Stay\u201d is an ethereal song by Vancouver Sleep Clinic. It talks about loving and the desire to have that love reciprocated. I love how the song is so vulnerable, it shows how open a person can be when loving \u2014 an exposure of the soul \u2014 it made the words Can you keep me close? Can you love me most? set a mood of yearning and a taste of love\u2019s paradox. Vancouver Sleep Clinic The stage name of the indie act, ambient singer, songwriter and record producer Tim Bettinson, told The Guardian, \u201cwhen I first starting [sic] writing for this project, I felt like it could be the type of atmospheric music that people could fall asleep to\u2026\u201d.  Hailing from Brisbane, Australia, Bettinson grew up jamming on his dad's Eagles and Fleetwood Mac records but he got his lightning bolt when he heard of Bon Iver's For Emma, Forever Ago and Sigur Ros' Valtari \u2014 from that moment, he knew he wanted to make music and not just listen to it. Below are the lyrics to his song \u201c Someone To Stay\u201d You were alone, left out in the coldClinging to the ruin of your broken heartToo lost and hurting to carry your loadWe all need someone to hold You\u2019ve been fighting the memory, on your ownNothing worsens; nothing growsI know how it feels being by yourself in the rainWe all need someone to stayWe all need someone to stay Hear you, falling and lonely, cry out:Will you fix me up? Will you show me hope?At the end of the day it will help usCan you keep me close? Can you love me most? You\u2019ve drunk it down and you\u2019ve spat it outAnd nothing tastes like the things you hadSo turn it off, why don\u2019t you let them go?We all need someone to stayWe all need someone to stay Hear you, falling and lonely, cry outWill you fix me up? Will you show me hope?At the end of the day it will help usCan you keep me close? Can you love me most?Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?Can you keep me close? Can you love me most? You were alone, left out in the coldClinging to the ruin of your broken heartYou were falling and lonely, cry out:Will you fix me up? Will you show me hope?At the end of the day it will help usCan you keep me close? Can you love me? Hear you falling and lonely cry out:Will you fix me up? Will you show me hope?At the end of the day it will help usCan you keep me close? Can you love me most?Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?Can you keep me close? Can you love me most With a music that is soothing, rich vocals accompanied with deep and meaningful lyrics, nothing can get even better than this.
