Most all of us are misunderstood to various degrees and levels of expression. It doesn\u2019t take a genius or Gator Nation to understand the concept of a \u201cSwamp.\u201d For the majority of us we could care less as long as we are safe and comfortable. Freedom is the American way, so we all can express ourselves as we please. Currently we have somewhat of partial societal mass hysteria outside the norm of political dialogue due to propaganda by both the media and biased politicians. I don\u2019t recall this much personal animus for the past 7 Presidents, combined. Obviously It is partially the advent of social media allowing the commen folk to place opinions. Unfortunately, a large percent of common folk, though hard workers and everything else, are not literally highly skilled, thus they express themselves, in general more from emotion and less from rational discussion. In the past, people were in general more conscious of the \u201cOffice of the President\u201d regardless of the persons foibles. The sad fact is that both Political Sides are currently at the whims of the Police State. The USA is currently operating as a PoliceState because the DOJ and Inteligence Agencies are stonewalling Congressional (WeThePeople) legal right to all documentation in The Mueller Investigation. We have the right to ALL documentation every 90 days. Yes, there is an Inspector Generals report coming out, hopefully that will help. . ObamaGate Timeline of Corruption | MAGA PILL ",

            "answer_text": "People take what he says, and present it in a one dimensional and reductive way. Completly missing the nuance and what he was getting at. The media straw man him a lot, he is an easy target. He goes against the grain, and speaks more by picking up key words and going off that into long answers. He speaks more in a stream of conciousness. Its easy to skip all of that and single out something and remove the context for clicks. ",
