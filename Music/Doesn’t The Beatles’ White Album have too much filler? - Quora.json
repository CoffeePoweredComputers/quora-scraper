But the Beatles idea was to record everything they had in mind and release this crazy, diverse, self-indulgent album filled with music. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer to that is no, and that too many quality songs were written by the four of them in 1968, that to just write them and leave them unreleased/unrecorded, or even recorded half the songs and not released at the time would not have been an option for them, so to release a double album was just an extension of what they did from 1963 up to 1965 by releasing two albums a year, but unlike in those years there are no cover versions. no pressure of touring, or anyone to stop them deciding that they should make this a single album only. Obviously I am looking at this from the perspective of the UK albums and that Magical Mystery Tour LP was not officially released in the UK until 1976. George Martin is wrong that it should have been a single album, but then which songs would have been left off, and those that did, we would now be asking why was it edited down to a single album at the time.
