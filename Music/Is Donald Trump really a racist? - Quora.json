            "answer_text": "Months ago, I posted an answer on this thread: https://www.quora.com/Is-Donald-Trump-really-a-racist Yesterday (2/7/2020), I got an email from \u201cQuora Moderation\u201d Apparently, despite the 47 upvotes, someone named Cody Zerb \u201csuggested\u201d an edit to improve my answer. He decided that my entire answer should be deleted and this put in its place: \u201cim retired and have too much time on my hands and feel the need to defend a racist rapist\u201d Do you suppose that qualifies for Quora\u2019s be nice, be respectful policy? Boy Howdy! Nuff Said! https://www.quora.com/Is-Donald-Trump-really-a-racist/answer/David-Grant-84 Edit: Because Quora moderation sent me another email apologizing for what they refer to a a \u201cbot\u201d mistake (WOW! Those bots get amazing;y personal and insulting), they claim my original post was allowed. Unfortunately, it just wasn\u2019t restored. Let\u2019s try the original post again: As someone who did not vote for Trump, I find the anger and hatred displayed by those who disagree with his politics sad but amusing. Much like spoiled children, these arrogant narcists cannot seem to control their emotional tirades. The examples these people use to show how Trump is a racist are weak at best. These attempts at dehumanization are not open attempts to achieve the political goal of installing their own political regimes to power. Researching these articles, and having much experience with the progressive mindset, I can imagine a progressive dismissing the sources. I can imagine a progressive believing they are unrealistically biased. I can even imagine a progressive believing they are not factually based. Because I have come to see that progressives who claim, \u201cWe believe in facts,\u201d are really just saying, \u201cWe believe in facts that support our narrative. We dismiss everything that challenges our preconceived viewpoints\u201d There is corroboration for my view: Camille Paglia takes on Jon Stewart, Trump, Sanders: \u201cLiberals think of themselves as very open-minded, but that\u2019s simply not true!\u201d http://www.salon.com/2015/07/29/camille_paglia_takes_on_jon_stewart_trump_sanders_liberals_think_of_themselves_as_very_open_minded_but_that%E2%80%99s_simply_not_true/ \u2026 Liberals think of themselves as very open-minded, but that\u2019s simply not true! Liberalism has sadly become a knee-jerk ideology, with people barricaded in their comfortable little cells. They think that their views are the only rational ones, and everyone else is not only evil but financed by the Koch brothers. It's so simplistic!

You just repeat some familiar words and people will react pretty much the way Pavlov\u2019s dog was conditioned to react to certain sounds.\u201d Trump has made America less racist TRUMP MAY BE 'THE MOST PRO-BLACK PRESIDENT' WE'VE EVER SEEN, SAYS PASTOR WHO CLAIMS OBAMA DIDN'T MAKE AN EFFORT https://www.newsweek.com/trump-may-be-most-pro-black-president-weve-ever-seen-says-pastor-who-claims-1053648 Jesse Jackson praises and thanks Donald Trump for a lifetime of service to African Americans  Lynne Patton pushes back at Rep.

Muslim CNN Guest Takes Stand for Trump, Trashes Islamophobia Talks: \u2018The President Is Beloved\u2019 https://www.israpundit.org/muslim-cnn-guest-takes-stand-for-trump-trashes-islamophobia-talks-the-president-is-beloved/ \u2026 The president and the White House condemned the attack. Although admitting the word choice was \u201cpoor\u201d and the timing \u201cmuch worse,\u201d Ahmed encouraged Whitfield to look at the big picture. \u201cThere is nothing \u2014 the president has no responsibility if a fanatic mentions him in a manifesto. A fanatic could equally mention me. So, I don\u2019t think that is his responsibility,\u201d she said, adding she would like to see Trump condemn all forms of \u201clethal bigotry.\u201d \u201cAnd one thing the viewers should know, this president and this administration is often castigated as Islamophobic, but I move in the Muslim word, in Egypt, in Oman, in Jordan, in Iraqi Kurdistan where this president is beloved,\u201d she said\u2026 \u2026 During her interview, she also touched on the controversy that surrounded Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim, over comments that were condemned as anti-Semitic. \u201cAnti-Semitism occurred in Congress, and the reaction was when there was outrage that this was somehow hate directed at a Muslim who is spewing Islamist ideology. So, we have to be extremely clear about the language, clear about the narrative \u2026,\u201d she said. But, as Thomas Sowell says, many progressives \u201creact pretty much the way Pavlov\u2019s dog was conditioned to react\u201d when discussing Trump: WATCH: Students Slam \u2018Trump\u2019 Wall Quotes, Then They Learn Who Actually Said Them http://conservativemedia.us/u-s/watch-students-slam-trump-wall-quotes-then-they-learn-who-actually-said-them/ As the government shutdown continues due the impasse in Congress over the funding for President Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful wall,\u201d Campus Reform thought it would be enlightening to visit a college campus and hear from students on the problem driving the whole wall idea: illegal immigration. What Campus Reform\u2019s Cabot Phillips found was that students at American University recoiled at the rhetoric of Democratic leaders \u2014 if they thought it was Trump doing the talking, that is. As Campus Reform highlights in a video and accompanying article posted Tuesday, until very recently, Democrats have sounded a whole lot more like Trump than #AbolishICE leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In fact, here are a few quotes that the conservative group thought college students might be interested in hearing: \u201cIllegal Immigration is wrong, plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress.\u201d -Senator Chuck Schumer, 2009 \u201cWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented and unchecked.\u201d -Barack Obama, 2005 \u201cI voted numerous times\u2026 to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders.\u201d -Hillary Clinton, 2008 So would students agree with the unequivocal assertions by Democratic leaders about the importance of stopping illegal immigrants from \u201cpour[ing] into the United States undetected, undocumented and unchecked\u201d and their commitment to \u201cbuild[ing] a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in\u201d? The answer turned out to be no, so long as students were told the quotes were President Trump\u2019s. Phillips begins by asking the students how they feel about the idea of a border wall generally. He gets a bunch of negative responses, including that a wall is \u201cabsolutely horrendous.\u201d \u201cEveryone has a shared reaction to this,\u201d says one male student, apparently speaking on behalf of the entire student population. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely horrendous.\u201d Others are more measured, simply dismissing the idea of a wall as \u201cuseless\u201d and ineffective, while one cited the \u201cfencing\u201d that already exists. But things get really interesting when Philips reads the above quotes \u201cfrom President Trump.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s divisive,\u201d says one young man. \u201cI think America is a land of opportunity, a place for inclusion.\u201d \u201cI just really think it\u2019s kind of hateful speech in general,\u201d says a female student. \u201cIt\u2019s just a negative message,\u201d offers another. \u201cWhen he talks about illegal immigrants it\u2019s just, one, rude, to talk about people like that.\u201d The \u201cTrump\u201d quote \u201cunderlies\u201d a lot about \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and \u201cprejudice,\u201d says another student. \u201cThere are racial biases kinda deeply embedded in there,\u201d says a male student. \u201cI think it\u2019s, overall, just unacceptable,\u201d concludes one student. Other key words dropped by students in response to the \u201cTrump\u201d quotes include \u201cjingoistic\u201d and \u201cdehumanizing.\u201d When Phillips finally reveals that the quotes were from Schumer, Obama and Clinton, the students are largely left speechless, sometimes laughing: \u201cHow about that?!\u201d says one student, smiling. The vast majority of these reactions are clearly politically motivated. Where have progressives so vocally displayed similar disgust, anger, and hatred about these issues: Most say race relations worsened under Obama, poll finds https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/obama-race-relations-poll/index.html 20 great moments in liberal bigotry http://www.ihatethemedia.com/20-great-moments-in-liberal-bigotry California's new racial discrimination http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2014-02/25/content_17302862.htm It is condescending to assume that some groups are not as competitive as others, which is racial discrimination of a new kind. Rather than privileges automatically enjoyed because of belonging to a particular group, personal character, hard work and other qualities within an individual's control should be the only factors determining educational competition. California's SCA-5 amendment means taking a significant step back in time. There is a double standard that splits along ideological lines. Let us not forget about this issue. This was the moment when I lost most respect for the current feminist movement as driven less by principles than politics: \u2018What About Bill?\u2019 Sexual Misconduct Debate Revives Questions About Clinton https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/us/politics/bill-clinton-sexual-misconduct-debate.html \u2026 Matthew Yglesias, a liberal blogger who once worked at the Center for American Progress, a pillar of the Clinton political world, wrote on Vox - Understand the News on Wednesday that \u201cI think we got it wrong\u201d by defending Mr. Clinton in the 1990s and that he should have resigned. Chris Hayes, the liberal MSNBC host, said on Twitter that \u201cDemocrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.\u201d Caitlin Flanagan, a social critic who calls herself a \u201clifelong Democrat, an enemy of machine feminism and a sexual assault survivor,\u201d wrote on The Atlantic\u2019s website that \u201cthe Democratic Party needs to make its own reckoning of the way it protected Bill Clinton.\u201d Michelle Goldberg wrote a New York Times column headlined, \u201cI Believe Juanita.\u201d David Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration official, said Monica S. Lewinsky \u201cdeserves an apology from many of us she has never received.\u201d \u2026 \u2026 She expressed bitterness that liberals and feminists did not believe her or the other accusers at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re hypocrites,\u201d she said. \u201cThey worship at the altar of all things Clinton. They\u2019re all over Roy Moore, but they had nothing to say about Bill Clinton when he was accused of doing what he was accused of doing.\u201d Paula Jones, another accuser, said they were not taken seriously until now. \u201cIt\u2019s like me and Juanita and Kathleen have been screaming for years for someone to pay attention to us on the liberal side, and it\u2019s like no one would hear us,\u201d she said by telephone. \u201cThey made fun of me. They didn\u2019t believe me. They said I was making it up.\u201d Major Women\u2019s Groups Silent On Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018Abuse Of Power\u2019 Comments https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-abuse-of-power-womens-groups_n_5bc4c4d9e4b01a01d68d3d28 Hillary Clinton set the internet ablaze on Sunday when she told CBS\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning\u201d that the affair between her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky was not an abuse of power\u2026 \u2026 Advocates against sexual violence have said it\u2019s impossible for a president to have a consensual sexual relationship with an intern, given the unequal power dynamics. But six major women\u2019s advocacy groups \u2015 EMILY\u2019s List, National Organization for Women, Time\u2019s Up, Planned Parenthood, Ultraviolet and Feminist Majority \u2015 have been noticeably silent on Clinton\u2019s controversial remarks. These organizations have been outspoken supporters of Me Too or deeply critical of the numerous sexual misconduct allegations against President Donald Trump \u2015 or both. These Quora posts are particularly poignant. They remind me of when I hear progressives say they support \u201cthe working man.\u201d Unless the \u201cworking man\u201d does not agree with their politics. Then they refer to them as undereducated rednecks from flyover country. That does not sound supportive to me, but humans are capable of huge rationalizations. Why do some conservatives think liberals are the racist ones? https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-conservatives-think-liberals-are-the-racist-ones/answer/Mark-Anthony-Canty I don\u2019t think, I know: try being a black conservative. I have been in the Republican party since I was 18 years old, and I have never once experienced racism of any shape, form, or fashion. Don\u2019t think I am some token either. I have been internally critical about the opposition to gay marriage, sodomy laws, and discrimination against gays in state programs like adoption since day one. Many didn\u2019t like what I had to say, but my arguments are heard and debated respectfully. Conversely, I have been called a sellout, house nigger, Uncle Tom, race traitor, Oreo, coconut (in the UK of all places), wannabe white, and one of the most condescending things, that I have to admit has provoked me to violence at times: a white liberal explaining to me how I am oppressed, and a victim of \u201csystemic racism.\u201d When this infamous quote was made, where was the outcry? Where was the indignation?

(In case you are not familiar with XIV Foundation, their name refers to the 14th Amendment and they focus on \u201cliberty and justice for all.\u201d) From the XIV Foundation\u2019s press release: After watching the segment, Gratz remarked, \u201cNo one group has a monopoly on racism. And to suggest otherwise is a ridiculous, terrible message to broadcast to children and adults alike on national TV.\u201d Really, Chris? Do you really believe that BS? Apparently, there are many progressives who do, or they would have shown as much outrage for these issues as for Trump: Eric Holder: Black Panther case focus demeans 'my people' http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0311/Eric_Holder_Black_Panther_case_focus_demeans_my_people.html AG Eric Holder Won\u2019t Prosecute New Black Panthers \u2018Cause They\u2019re \u201cHis People\u201d http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2011/03/03/ag-eric-holder-wont-prosecute-new-black-panthers-cause-theyre-his-people/ Black Panther Boss Who Got Off For Voter Intimidation Arrested http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2013/06/black-panther-boss-who-got-off-for-voter-intimidation-arrested/ \u2018Kill Whitey\u2019 Panther is held on gun rap http://nypost.com/2013/06/22/kill-whitey-panther-is-held-on-gun-rap/ Black Lives Matter protesters berate white students studying at Dartmouth library http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/16/black-lives-matter-protesters-berate-white-student/ Roughly 150 Black Lives Matter protesters reportedly stormed a library at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, Thursday night to berate students studying there for their supposed racial privilege.

            "answer_text": "I am a black man in my early 40s who dislikes DJT and has never voted for a Republican president. I can say with certainty, that I do not believe that Donald Trump is a racist. Donald Trump in my opinion is a purely transactional human being. DJT does not have a strictly static view of right v wrong, or good v bad. DJT believes in being loyal to people - as long as that loyalty serves his purpose at the time. DJT believes in being nice to foreign leaders who are nice to him - regardless of what is in the interest of the nation or its people. DJT cares about what is best for DJT, first and foremost. I have seen racists and white supremacists for years. Obviously, I disagree with what they stand for. However, white supremacists usually believe that they are fighting for a cause that is bigger than themselves. They believe they are fighting for their race as a whole. They often believe they are fighting for God. Whether or not they are or should be fighting for those things - they do believe. A racist has morals, but those morals are bad. Do you believe that DJT cares about a race of people - even if it is his own? Do you believe Trump could name 3 members of the confederacy? Do you believe that Trump would fight for God, or that Trump believes God would fight for Trump. Do you truly believe that Donald Trump has even once in 2017, knelt down and asked God for guidance or assistance? Has Donald Trump even once apologized for anything, or even admitted an error as president? I don\u2019t know that Trump has any morals that extend beyond himself. Donald Trump knows who his supporters are. He knows who is for him and who is against him. He knows that his supporters support confederate monuments, and that the protesters who are against him are also against confederate monuments. It is easy to then assume that Trump likes one group because of their beliefs and dislikes the other group because of their beliefs. Trump cares about their actions - and specifically their votes. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like black voters collectively as a group. I have no compunction about making that statement. However, he dislikes us because we are against him - not because of our race or his morality (if any). If we showed him fealty first, he would have BLM and the NAACP over to the White House every month. In order for me to call Trump a racist, I would have to concede that he believes in something bigger than his reelection. I don\u2019t believe that he does. ",
