            "answer_text": "I think that this topic suits them perfectly :) :D I never really thought about this but I can see there's literally every single emotion for them :) Anger Park Jimin  Even tho he's my Bias wrecker he is a very SASSY and very angry person \ud83d\udc4c:/ in Facct so angry that other members have to decide either run or hide or just pretend to be dead.. Even his stare makes u think your already in hell\u2026  Yes Ladies\u2026  This is the same Park Jimin we're talking about  Although a lot of you don't agree with me in comments.. Just come to think about it..  Which member has the shortest temper of them all? \ud83d\ude0f..  Aha.. That's right.. You can't even find another one who suits properly..  I will say this.. I didn't chose this for him to make him look bad or worse then other members, but actually this is one thing I like about him and behind this there is no bad intentions at all.. And besides.. Don't you even dare to think that people who looks so good, charming and cute can be only nice.. (is u dumm like? \ud83d\ude0f \ud83d\ude02 Had to ask) \ud83d\udc98 cause literally every person has this side, but it depends on who is showing it much more ebetter then the others.. And who's hiding it well..  Next one\u2026 A Joy \ud83e\udd2d M r. KIM NAMJOON \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\ude0d My lovely, sexy Bias  Let's say Namjoonie owes this one completely..  In Joonies case every award show and speech parts he's done \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0c he's such a lovely and caring leader for BTS  I honestly don't know how much cheerfulness and joy this one man can hold, but okk \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc9c  Namjoon can literally be our president..  He's very obedient to his own thoughts, very smart and always sets everything right for the ones that are besides him..  I'm Deadass Hobi Staring at Joon with my tongue out like a lil side Hoe maniac by his side \ud83d\ude02:D:) XD I'm done with myself srsly  Also Joon is just out here freaking built like that \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24  Okokok You must be wonder I love him now too much Yes I do (also showing you that he's much more better then your sweet Trio VMinKook, also I already dragged them :)) Next one Fear Jung Hoseok \u2600  If these pictures are not freaking tragic for him then idk what is \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  He is deadass the definition of Fear\u2026    His screaming is the loudest I have ever heard :D also Idk why but I relate to him cause I'm sometimes even scared of my own shadow :D XD don't laugh at mei \ud83d\ude02but only without screaming unlike ma Boi..  Next one The moment you've all been waiting for xdxd DISGUST Min Yoongi AXA Suga Who esle? :) \ud83d\udc9c I-..  Well you can tell he is disgusted 24/7  If not more.. But then I have to make another number to show that but that's not possible.  I had never seen so much disgust in one person all along :D  He's another definition of Disgust unlike Hobi :D   Sometimes Yoongi looks nice like this and it's a Magic if u ask me but yea mostly he's just disgusted af..  Even on VLive Wtf \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44  Next one more better note for you Happiness Kim Taehyung Yes.. He's one Big Happy grown up Kid \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc9c  He always looks rather happy and healthy and very positive as a person, even in real life also this is where I'm gonna say he has a lot of friends, he's a Capricorn like me and if we're happy we draw a lot of freakish people to us and make really good friends, but we don't choose friends like a Blind H0e walking downstairs \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  Tae always looks happy even tho there's probably some amount of Army's who will disagree with me and will kick my AsS for this but he just is and we love it.. Yea sometimes he can cry or get down but he tries to remain happy always  And what's important to him, will remain important forever     Next one (get your handkerchiefs out)\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27 Sadness Jeon Jungkook  You may think no this is legit wrong but he suits this emotion smh.. One way or another..  I didn't really thought about this but now that I do he can little bit relate to this emotion but not like fully\u2026 Cause one momento he can be like this (fine)  Another he's just a puddle on the floor (mostly on stage) God knows what's going on off stage when he's alone..  Kookie is one member that cries a lot always, even the members say he does and in one interview they were asked who's most likely to cry over a sad movie and they all said JK :) \ud83d\udc9c  I hate to say this but he is kinda a cry baby, even tho he's strong, and tries to be mature as possible is still very young guy, besides we're perhaps almost the same age tho somewhat..  Also this sht makes me so angry but I'll explain this for you my dear Army's\u2026  This is what people are expecting Jungkook should be like\u2026and look like..  But in reality Kookie is just such a soft and fluffy cute ball that needs to be protected..  I wish u still love him the way he is and stop dragging him about being less mature and too emotional cause that's the part of him.. Did he chose it? No.. But he has to deal with a lot and it really Fricks young people's mind\u2026  Last one Surprise KIM SEOK JIN  Idk how to explain this but it kinda suits him  Surprise is a feeling for a major event and he owes it\u2026  I mean every single award show :)  But also maybe he's a surprise himself? Idk \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc99  I'll let you judge :)    ",
