            "answer_text": "Really, that\u2019s an impossible question to answer because the top orchestras will be required to have high standards in the other departments as well. Today, the standards of cello and viola playing are nearly as high as for the violin, while it still remains true that many professional Doublebass (contrabass) players can\u2019t even play in tune; they tend to be the lowest standard in the entire orchestra. The reason for this is simple: there have been fewer opportunities to develop as soloists on this instrument, and that also means less competition. Which orchestra you consider to have the best cello section will probably also be that orchestra which you consider to be the best all round. However, as with asking, \u201cWho is the world\u2019s best pianist?\u201d any answer will be a purely subjective one. ",

            "answer_text": "Seriously, there is no supreme cello section today. Or, more accurately, every world-class orchestra has one. Even many second-tier orchestras have cello sections of top quality. The young musicians coming up today on all instruments are phenomenal. I am hearing conservatory orchestras that are far better than many recordings of famous top orchestras from my parents\u2019 day. These kids have taken as their minimum standard a level that two generations ago was a high bar. And there are so many of them playing that well. ",
