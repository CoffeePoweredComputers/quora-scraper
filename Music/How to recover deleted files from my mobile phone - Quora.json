            "answer_text": "Refer to this site http://www.easyphonerecovery.com... I downloaded the software and followed all the instructions mentioned in this guide. To my pleasant surprise, I got my SMS\u2019s, WhatsApp messages (without any video attachment), and MOST of the pictures (unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t get all the pictures) and few videos back. First, I scanned my Android with the \u2019Standard Mode\u2019 (without rooting my device) of the software and I saw some text messages, and 4-5 deleted pictures that I lost in the scanning results, but that wasn\u2019t enough for me so I tried the \u2018Advanced Mode\u2019 as well. In the Advanced Mode, software had applied some soft root on my device. It was quick and easy. After scanning my device for about an hour, software showed me all the text messages, most of the pictures/photos (not all of them) and few videos that I lost during updating my device in the \u201cPreview\u201d. In the end, I clicked the \u201cRecover\u201d button and got all the data back. I didn\u2019t try but as per the website, this software can also recover deleted data from the SD card. Remember, you can unroot your device later if you want. Here is good step-by-step tutorial to unroot an Android device: How to Unroot Your Android Phone Apart from the software I mentioned above, I also tried this Play Store app: https://play.google.com/store/ap... to get my lost data back. In order to use this app, you need to first root your device yourself as it needs root/SuperUser permission to scan your device. Unlike the above software, this software does not help you to root your device. It didn\u2019t find any deleted pictures or text messages of my Android but it did show some videos and Whatsapp messages in the scan results. This is it! I hope someone who is looking to recover deleted Android data will find my answer. ",
