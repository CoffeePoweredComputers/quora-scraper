            "answer_text": "Buy used. Make sure the setup (string height and intonation) is either perfect or that you allow for the cost of a pro setup in your budgeting. Buy a brand whose guitars are designed in the USA and manufactured in China. These brands include (but are hardly limited to) Recording King and Blueridge. If you\u2019re interested in a brand which you have never heard of, do your homework. Read reviews. Watch video demos. Be an educated consumer. The OP lives within driving distance of one of America\u2019s great guitar stores, Elderly Instruments in East Lansing, Michigan. It\u2019s worth a trip just for the learning experience and expert advice. Buy a guitar with a solid wood top. Solid wood back and sides are nice but not essential. The neck should feel comfortable to you, both the width and the depth. I bought my son a used Blueridge BR-143 with a hard case for $300. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to gig or record with it. The headstock inlay is a bit too ornate for my taste, but the construction, playability and sound are all great. One of my favorite guitars is a Recording King ROS-626 12-fret 000-style. I bought it used for $400. It\u2019s a great fingerstyle guitar worth much more than even its original $800 street price. This model has been discontinued but I hear very good things about its replacement. An employer asked me as a favor to find a good $100 guitar for his son to learn on. I found a used Fender acoustic that was worth the money. Not one that I would want for myself, but a nice first guitar that played easily, sounded like a guitar and stayed in tune. Definitely a step above being a \u201cGuitar-Shaped Object\u201d. The traditional cheap used guitar when I was a youngster was the Yamaha FG series from the 1970s. Since then, the use of CNC in guitar manufacturing and the Chinese embrace of quality control have resulted in a major improvement in the quality of low-end guitars. ",

            "answer_text": "I like epiphones and have played them since 1994. They have a new Masterbuilt archtop with a really great sound system priced from 600\u2013900 dollars. You can sometimes find a store model at a discount from Guitar Center. Epiphone also has flatop acoustic electrics starting around $250-$500. My first Epiphone was, is a 1994 Archtop with quilted maple top, sides and back with round sound hole, I love this guitar. I currently have a Gibson Avant Garde Acoustic and Takamine. Also, in the heard are a matching pair of Guild Guitars, both have an arched back and sunburst top. I installed Martin 332 piezo pickups in these and have owned them 12 string 1987 and six string 1990. The Guild 12 string plays and sounds amazing. However, the six string played awful and a couple years ago I spent almost $200 for a neck an fret job. However the Gibson and Takamine are my go to guitars. The Epiphone has been played lots and now has some wear but still sounds and plays well. ",
