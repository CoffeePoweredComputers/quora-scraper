            "answer_text": "Before I write my answer, I\u2019d like to warn everyone: I\u2019m not an Atiny. I\u2019ve never stanned Ateez, let alone any kpop group, but I look at their music videos and watch their performances. They have been really outstanding performers since day one and I couldn\u2019t get enough of the stages from Wonderland and Hala Hala. It was one of my favorite hits from 2019 and it should never been under appreciated. I even had the pleasure of seeing them perform at KCON NY 2019 and they killed it. Blew me away completely. Personally, I wasn\u2019t too fond of Ateez\u2019s music until Hala Hala came out. I think a lot of their music aren\u2019t songs you\u2019d just bop to casually in the car; they are meant to be performed due to the nature of how their music is composed (with the exceptions of Hala Hala and Wonderland). The beats and sound effects are too generic or awkward to just listen to around the house. For example, I have never been crazy about Say My Name, but it looked phenomenal on stage. The lighting, choreography, and arena speakers seriously boost just about everything about the song and it\u2019s not the same without those elements. Now onto actually answering your question\u2026 Because Wonderland was just so powerful, I found Answer to be underwhelming. However, remember, this is from a non-stan, which means I\u2019m not paying attention to all the little hints that are put in the lyrics or anything like that because I simply don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not saying it was a bad song because it isn\u2019t; I don\u2019t follow Ateez enough to understand what the song truly means and what led up to the idea for this comeback from past albums. So yeah, in short, I am unable to appreciate the depth of this song because I do not understand the story and I\u2019m not about to listen to every single Ateez song from every album and go back to all their teasers or other extras to figure it out. Plus, like I said, the dynamics of the song are so much different from Wonderland that I found it quite mild and didn\u2019t do much for me. I hope you\u2019re not offended by that and that you can understand where I\u2019m coming from. I\u2019m sure Atinys can truly see the beauty behind this comeback because I read another response taking about how the song is linked to previous stuff they did. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer by Ateez was a very well thought out song. Their concept which was powerful and dark but uplifting made the song very likable and addicitve to listen to. Personally when I heard it the first time I wasn't a huge fan of it because it's a lot to take in, the choreography, the asthetics, and especially the way the music flowed. It wasnt that I hated it, but it was overwhelming in a sense and I needed to get used to it. I think this song definitely plays to Ateez concept of powerful stages and overhwhelming emotions, it makes the fans startled but in a good way and that's what gets them hooked. Hongjoong definitely has a strategy here with his songs and as Ateez is getting more popular they are playing more to their strengths and this song allows them to show their radiating stage presence. Overall, I can't get this damn song out of my head. HELP. ",
