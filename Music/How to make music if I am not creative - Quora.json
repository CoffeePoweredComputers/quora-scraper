            "answer_text": "Creativity is over-rated. Firest, creativity is made, not born. You do not lack anything that the most creative people possess. What you haven\u2019t done yet is to work as hard at creating something as they have. If you go back and lesten to the songs that many great writers turned out before they were famous, you\u2019ll discover that they were not great from the outset, they had to learn and grow. U recall ab ubtervuew wutg /Bruce Hornsby where he said he\u2019d wanted to write his hit \u201cThe Way It Is\u201d for a long time, but he wasn\u2019t ready as a sonwriter at first\u2014he had to get better to pull the idea off. I\u2019m presuming you want to to write music since your question is in the category. Well, then learn about the mechanics of writing music. You need to understand tonality and form and harmony and the congentions of any style, and if you\u2019re doing songs you need lyrics. I recommend watching the Leonard Bernstein series of Young People\u2019s Concerts on Youtube, it\u2019s a good start, and then get a college-level music theory text or enroll in a class.Also try to find articles about songwriters that relate how they write. Now, songwriters (and all creative people) do not work alike, but those who have long-term success approach it like a job. They set aside time every day for writing. If they get stuck on one piece, they start another and come back to it later. After finishing a piece, put it away and revisit it a few weeks later\u2014you may find there are edits and improvements and cuts that you didn\u2019t notice when you were so pleased to have finished one. Many find it essential to keep a diary with them at all times, for writing down ideas about subjects and snippets of lyric that might come to you spontaneously. Revisit the diary often. There are some psychollogical techniques to get the creative juices flowing; I like the old book \u201cDrawing on the Left Side of the Brain\u201d. Go easy on yourself. Being self-critical is essential, and understand that to be successful you must \u201cmurder your darlings\u201d (meaning that you have to be ready to trash something you\u2019d love to keep(, but don\u2019t ever fall into a self-defeating loop of thinking \u201cI suck, I\u2019ll never write anything good, I should just give up.\u201d The right self-talk is \u201cI wonder what I can do b etter?\u201d ",
