            "answer_text": "Due to our over-exposure to music from Bollywood (and regional) movies, we view Indian music as \"Bollywood songs\", \"Marathi songs\", \"Kannada songs\", etc. We make the mistake of categorising all music by language. This is natural and I have done it too. I can only answer this question based on my experience. Since I cannot say what genre of music you might be inclined to like more, I cannot point you to any specific artist to start with. Just pick a name from the many that are interspersed in my story below and listen to the artist's more famous songs. Pick another and repeat, and so on. If you like an artist, go through their discography. Over time, you will find out what you like and will be listening to stuff because you like it and not because you want to keep up with the Joneses...:) I grew up in a small town in Karnataka. I had no exposure to anything other than what I heard coming out of the TV speakers at home. We didn't have a cable TV subscription; DD was the only channel we could watch. Therefore, the music I listened to only consisted of movie songs (Hindi/Kannada) or occasionally, songs from Hindi pop albums. Even the cassette tapes (in the '90s) or CDs (early 2000s) at home were all Indian movie albums. Now I had cousins who lived in bigger cities, who seemed to be into \"English songs\" (pop stuff like Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears etc, which I loathe now). So, in my mid-teens, I longed to rise up to their level by acquainting myself with whatever they used to listen to. This wasn't possible in the absence of cable TV. However, when I was 16, we got an internet connection at home which flung open the door to the outside world. I started listening to famous pop songs of those days. As I said, I loathe this stuff today, but they sounded good to my 16/17-year-old self because I didn't know better then. As an undergrad student (in the same town), I had stepped into a different world. I was mingling with people who came from different cities, which led to my getting hold of the various MP3 collections that used to float around. Linkin Park was big at that time and I became an instant fan after listening to one of their songs. I also used to hang around and watch the college band jam which exposed me to various kinds of rock and metal. They covered bands like Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, The Doors, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Guns N' Roses, Pantera, Evanescence, The Cranberries, Nightwish, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Iron Maiden, etc. The exploration continued from there and I discovered other songs from the artists I already knew of. Over the years, I also came across other acts like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Blue Oyster Cult, Megadeth, Testament, Judas Priest, Ronnie James Dio, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Audioslave, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Jimi Hendrix, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Buckethead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billy Idol, Molly Hatchet, Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, Gary Moore, Rory Gallagher, etc. But it's never enough. The exploration continues even today, as it should, since there is practically unlimited music out there. The best part about the exploration is that it has led me to discover good Indian acts like Avial, Baiju Dharmajan, Agam, Soulmate, Sifar, Junkyard Groove, Swarathma, Peepal Tree, Girish and the Chronicles, etc. This wouldn't have happened if I had continued to want to listen to \"English songs\". Today, I am amused when I hear someone saying something like, \"I don't like English songs\", when they have only heard a handful of pop songs. If they put in just a little effort to dig deeper, they would appreciate the various genres/sub-genres that exist, and see that language does not matter. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not necessary for you to listen to English songs just because you want to fit in. You can listen to any song regardless of language, genre, or time period. What you need to focus on is the emotion you feel while listening to them. If you vibe with that song, does that song makes you feel something, is it groovy enough, is it melancholic enough, does it bring you to tears. Then all you need is suggestions. I'll list down a few songs just type them on the youtube search bar and you're all set. Just remember, music is a language that needs no explanation, you just listen and feel. Once you like it you can look up the lyrics and start to try and sing. Till then just enjoy! I'll try to mention songs from all genres. Without a language barrier. Memories by Maroon 5 One last time by Ariana Grande Side to Side by Nicki Minaj Toxic by Britney Spears Let me down Slowly by Alec Benjamin Boy with Luv by BTS (Korean) Lo que no me dices by Kimberly Tell (Spanish) Just a few you can lend a ear to, if you need more all you have do is ask! Happy Jamming, Suleman. ",
