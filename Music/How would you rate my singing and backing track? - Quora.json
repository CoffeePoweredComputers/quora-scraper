            "answer_text": "I really liked it! I think you have really good vocal tone and an overall nice voice, it\u2019s really pleasant to listen to and I really enjoyed it. The only things I would improve on are that it seems like a few times you tried to do a run but you let it float, instead of defining it. Which is fine, but usually runs have more of a point on them so you can tell it\u2019s a run, kind of like what Beyonc\u00e9 does in her song; \u201cIf I Were A Boy\u201d when she sings \u201cbOyYyY-HeE\u201d. If you don\u2019t sharpen your runs it makes it sound like you\u2019ve lost your breath. (1:13\u20131:17) Just make sure you define the notes more and stabilize them better. The backdrop was also really nice and calming, but I felt like it never left the chorus or changed, or if it did I didn\u2019t really notice it. Other than that the song overall was really pleasant and I wouldn\u2019t mind hearing more songs like that. ",

            "answer_text": "I listened to it, do you have an uncompressed version? I\u2019d like to be able to get a better handle on your vocals from a technical point of view. With close mic work & signing into your \u2018vocal fry\u2019 it\u2019s difficult to assess breathing & pitch control. If you have a .WAV file? I\u2019d like to hear it. based on this though, the mix is a bit heavy on the vocal side; and sounds separated. I\u2019d like to hear you sing with projection rather than close into the mic. It\u2019s not doing you any favors. ",
