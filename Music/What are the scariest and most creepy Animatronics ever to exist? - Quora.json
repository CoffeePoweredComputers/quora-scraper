            "answer_text": "Thank you, Devin Miller. Disneyland in Anaheim, California will invite high school marching bands from all over the country to march in their \u201cHome Town Parade.\u201d  It\u2019s quite an honor.  One year a high school band, Ferris HS, in Spokane, Washington was invited.  A friend of mine owned a charter bus company and drafted me to drive on of the five buses going to Disneyland. Imagine, a box loaded with 40 excited teenagers rolling down I 5.  The bus had a PA system and I had the only microphone.  The trip was 2 days down, 2 days back and 3 days on Los Angeles.  Fun trip! The first day was Disneyland.  The most excitement that day was trying to ride herd on close to 200 people.  Trying to get them from point A to point B to point C all together.  It was mostly small town teens.  Teens wander.  And get lost.  5 or 6 at a time.  Constantly.  Come to think of it that was pretty exciting. The next day was Universal Studios and Medieval Days dinner show that night.  Since I had been to all the attractions I was in charge. One of the bus drivers was a refugee from Croatia.  I took him under my wing and showed him around. In Universal Studios there is an attraction called Jurassic Park.  It\u2019s a boat ride complete with dinosaurs.  Up close and personal dinosaurs.  I had my Croatian friend sit on the right side of the boat by the water.  That\u2019s where it\u2019s best to see all the action.  He wasn\u2019t real happy with some of the Animatronic action he was seeing.  He had seen the movie and knew how it ended. These boats were 4 or 5 people wide and had a bar that came down and locked you into your seat.  There is a 85 or 90 foot \u201cwaterfall\u201d you go over at the end of the ride.  They didn\u2019t want anyone falling out.  The bar across your lap is locked down pretty tight. The ride itself is very pleasant.  Feels like you\u2019re drifting down a river through a land infested with dinosaurs.  Very peaceful.  When that dinosaur lifted it\u2019s head out of the water and roared RIGHT BESIDE THE BOAT where I had my friend sit my friend tried to leave.  Almost succeeded, too.  Well, except for his pants.  He left those under that bar.  He had managed to escape that lock-down bar, stood up and was trying to run across the boat in his skivvies.  Luckily he was one of those guys who wore underwear.  Jockey shorts.  I had to hold him down while the employees got our boat off to the side. We got him dressed in his torn pants, reseated and locked in the boat and continued the ride.  I had to threaten him to get him back in the boat.  He made me trade seats with him, no more edge of the boat for him. Those Universal Studio Animatronics were the scariest my Croat friend had ever seen.  You could say they scared the pants off of him. ",

            "answer_text": "Chuck E. Cheese and his cast of animatronic bandmates terrorized millions of children in North America from the late 70's until well into the mid 90's when somebody finally got a clue and they changed the design. Not only did they have the creepy animatronic band entertaining in the dining room, but costumed mascots roaming the arcade area to greet and hug the children after their meals, as well. The poor kiddies just couldn't escape the rat.        \ufffcToday, the rat and his friends are more child-friendly. It isn't like it used to be. No longer are the old robots serenading (and terrifying) little children as they sit in the dark eating their pizza pies, and no more bad dreams for little Tommy after a visit to Pizzatime Theater. Here is what the new, improved Chuck E. Cheese looks like:   Back when our kids were little, I remember them being petrified of visiting Chuck E. Cheese's Pizzatime Theater. He terrified them and there were tears. I'll admit he freaked me out a little bit, too. I waited until I got home to cry, though. ________________________________________ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese's ",
