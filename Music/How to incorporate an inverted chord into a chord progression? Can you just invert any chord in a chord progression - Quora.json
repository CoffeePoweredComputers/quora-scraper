            "answer_text": "I used to be a bass player, and I come from a family of bass players (jazz, pop and classical) and I write a lot professionally, and I think the choice of bass note is second only to the choice of melody. You are right to think this is important. As you probably know bass parts have their own logic and set of conventions (not really \u201crules\u201d) that are different from other parts. For example, there is a lot more leaping around accepted in a bass part, and most often the bass is the root of the chord, which is a stable note. This allows you to leap from it if necessary. The analogy I use is a solid stepping stone. You can leap from the stable ones, but not the wiggly ones (the 3rd or 7th!) Most often in an inverted chord, the note in the bass is the 3rd of the chord. In jazz, it can be the 7th (or some foreign note, but that\u2019s another topic, implying a different chord). As soon as the bass is on the less stable 3rd or 7th, it should be treated as if it was an inner voice. It has lost its \u201cbass privilege\u201d for a moment, and has to voice-lead like any other part (except the melody of course, who is the queen in this arrangement of hierarchy). Most often, a 3rd will move by step when the chord changes. Up or down are equally valid, but it depends on what the next chord actually is. Same for the 7th (if you are using four-note chords). So a C chord moving to an F chord might easily take an E in the bass on the C chord, since it will resolve satisfactorily to the stable F. C G Am might have a satisfactory bass line that moves C G/B Am, again resolving nicely by step (down, this time!) When the 5th is in the bass, these are usually restricted chords, in that they only have a few things they satisfactorily do. Passing. C G/D C/E or the reverse. The fifth is approached and left by step. Really though, the way it RESOLVES is much more important than the way it is approached.Alternating, or arpeggiating. The famous \u201croot, 5, root, 5\u201d of many a waltz, march, or country&western tune. Usually the 5th happens on the weakly accented beat or bar rather than the strongly accented one, but not always.Cadential. C/G G7 C. The C/G is really being treated like a G chord with TWO notes suspended; the C to B, and the E to D. Sounds a little old-fashioned these days.You can put passing notes in the bass whenever you want, too, but make sure they resolve by step in order not to sound like wrong notes. For example, C G/B Am Am/G F F/E Dm G7 C has one standard inversion G/B, then all the other slash chords are passing notes that AREN\u2019T necessarily chord tones. Having been a bassist for a while, I try to be sensitive to the relationship between the melody and the bass. Ideally, if the melody was played with the bass and nothing else, the chord progression should be clearly hearable, and the melody and bass should not be on the same note twice in a row. Once is fine, and often unavoidable, but those are the moments when you can look at inversions instead! I look for a good contrapuntal relationship too, meaning that the melody and bass don\u2019t move too much in the same direction. I hear some pop sometimes where the bass is on a sensitive note and so is the melody, then they BOTH move to the same note afterward! Drives me nuts. If you\u2019re in a punk band (or music descended from punk) then these principles don\u2019t really hold. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a complicated question, and far beyond the scope of an answer here. However, you can invert any chord, though you may not always want to. As for why, here\u2019s an example: Suppose you want to move directly from Em to Dm to Bdim to G, in the key of C. Em and Dm and Bdim and G just fit your melody best, and sound right with it in a way other chords don\u2019t. Well, that isn\u2019t a very strong motion. Em doesn\u2019t usually want to move to Dm, nor does Dm usually want to move to Bdim, nor does Bdim want to move to G. They just sound sort of random and pointless. But suppose you use a couple of inversions, and make it Em => Dm/A => Bdim/D => G. Now you have a cycle-of-fifths motion in the bass: E to A to D to G, and those chords seem to have a little stronger gravitation from one to the next, a little more drive in that motion, a little more wanting to go from one to the next. Not quite so random or pointless. In fact, if you then maybe go to G/D or G/B for the last two beats of G, then go back to Em and repeat the whole thing, it sounds pretty cool. Note that this is still completely diatonic. There are no passing chords out of the key, no borrowed V7-of-whatevers, no chromatic accidentals. And if you\u2019re doing something like singer-songwriter folk or country, it might be important to remain diatonic. ",
