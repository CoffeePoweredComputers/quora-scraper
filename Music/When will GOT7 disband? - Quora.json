            "answer_text": "If you talk about their contracts renewals then their contracts are set to expire in 2021..so probably they will start negotiating their contracts soon.. I personally think that GOT7 can surpass the 7-year curse. I\u2019ve been following GOT7 since their debut, I think they are really close to each other and they really care for each other\u2026not as bussiness partners, but as a family or friends. All agasse probably can sense that. Also at an interview when they promote Eclipse, JB and Jinyoung made statements that kinda relieved fans hearts..JB said that they will always have the same opinion to keep going as seven members. He then added that the members realize they cannot completely promote individually without each other. That\u2019s why they\u2019re going to protect GOT7 (I remember Yugyeom once said that it\u2019s not fun promote individual or as a unit, he missed promoting as a whole group.) Moreover, Jinyoung said that they never thought once that they will go separate ways once the 7 years are up. So yeah, I think and I really hope that GOT7 will be long lasting group. If maybe in the future they are not under JYP anymore, I hope they still keep being together as GOT7, just like Shinhwa did. ",

They even said it theirselves that they're not just a group, not just a bunch of guys that working together, not just some working partners. They are family. GOT7 is family. GOT7\u2019s members are having strong bonds like family. Even many people agreed with it, maybe try to watch their videos to see how it makes sense? They are caring each others well! AND OH got7\u2019s members parents are close with each other, they sometimes hang out together even went abroad to meet up!!! Not just GOT7, their parents are also having good relationships. Sweet!\u2661 After all, i can't predict something, so i don't know if there's something that will happen in the future that might affect them to do that (guess i\u2019m allergic to word disband lol jk). I hope that will not going to happen. Never ever! Have a nice day here are picts of their parents met up (p.s. the meet up isn't just once or twice!)   ",

I keep myself updated on got7 literally and the rumors are just getting out of hand , which I don't know where and who it started from , but I'm quite sure Got7 won't be disbanding around\u2026 NOW . Their newly released album has gotten quite SOME interests from fans , receiving quite a good reaction so I don't think 'disbanding' will be their current fact . ",
