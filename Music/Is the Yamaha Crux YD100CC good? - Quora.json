            "answer_text": "Yamaha Crux Features and Overview The Yamaha Crux is an entry-level commuter bike from Yamaha India. It is powered by a 106cc single cylinder engine, and is mated to a four-speed gearbox. The bike comes with features such as adjustable rear shock-absorbers, multi-reflector headlamps, a wide seat for riding comfort, and chrome-plated fenders.  Mileage, Price and Colours of the Yamaha Crux The 2016 Yamaha Crux delivers an average mileage of 75.5 kmpl. The bike is priced at Rs.39,667(ex-showroom, Delhi), and is available in two shades, Black and Maroon.  Design and Ergonomics The Crux is positioned as an entry-level commuter bike, and is targeted at the mass market. It is styled conservatively, so that it would appeal to a wide range of consumers. The bike offers the rider an upright riding position, with wide handlebars and middle-set foot pegs. This minimises the pressure applied on the lower back and wrists, thereby improving comfort while riding for extended durations.  Engine and Gearbox The Crux is powered by an air-cooled 106cc single cylinder engine that produces 7.4 bhp and 7.5 Nm of torque, and employs a 4-speed gearbox to transfer power to the rear wheel.  Suspension The Crux comes equipped with telescopic front forks and Swingarm at the rear end.  Braking The Crux employs 130mm drum brakes at the front and rear wheels. At last, my opinion is yeah! i think it\u2019s good. Average mileage of 75.5 kmpl though, it\u2019s only Rs.39,667. ",
