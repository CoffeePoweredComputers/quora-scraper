            "answer_text": "First use normalize effect with just the D.C. Bias function checked. Then use equalization. Add 4 to 6 dB at 300 or 316HZ then the same at 3000HZ. You can roll-down the very top frequencies to attenuate hiss. Listen on preview to see how it sounds. You can preview compression at default settings and see if you like it, if so you can play with the settings. I usually don't bother with it because to me, my opinion, when adjusted to make a difference it changes the sound too much. But that\u2019s me so here is a link to an article about a great downloadable compressor for Audacity. How to use Chris's Dynamic Compressor for great volume in Audacity \u2013 Also might be helpful: TAP005 Good Compressor Setup in Audacity | eHow if your recording is mono you can go to tracks and add a track, then use pseudo-stereo, a Nyquist plugin that is free. use minimal settings as too much sounds echoish. Nyquist Effect Plug-ins Then normalize or amplify to -3bB. Another thing you can do is use change speed to slightly slow down the audio to lower your voice, if desired. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I would suggest using Cubase for recording and Nuendo for editing. Audacity is a pretty basic software and I honestly do not prefer it. Nuendo is my favorite audio editing software till date. To make your vocals sound better, you can normalize the track and then use reverb, double delays and mod delays. However, I would like to say one thing to you. Do not overdo it. Keep your voice as natural as possible. This is the reason why there has been a major shift of preference to live performances. Those live acoustic sessions are the best ever, right? So, keep it as natural as possible. Overdoing it will sound way too bad. Hope this helped! Cheers! ",
