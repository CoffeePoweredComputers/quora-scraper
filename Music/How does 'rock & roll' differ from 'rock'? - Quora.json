            "answer_text": "Good question that I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a good answer to. The genre we all know and love now called \u201crock\u201d started as Rock and Roll, the term was coined by Cleveland, Ohio DJ, Alan Freed as the name of part of his show, \u201cThe Rock and Roll Sessions\u201d. Freed\u2019s show featured a mix of country and rhythm and blues. I think I can remember hearing an interview (but I can\u2019t recall who was being interviewed) and reading somewhere (again, can\u2019t recall) that the \u201crock\u201d was the uptempo mash-up of country (which had a swing to it) and blues (which had a thump to it) music; two forms of American Roots music. The swing in country is probably because much of it was written in 3/4 time (like a waltz). And the blues would have been 4/4 time which gave the all important \u201cback-beat.\u201d So, rock moved country to 4/4 time but \u201cswung it a little\u201d and upped the back-beat of the 4/4 blues music. It also used the 12-bar format of the blues. The roll part this is the part I seem to recall hearing and reading was the \u201cgospel\u201d music. The times were the segregated, Jim Crow south and the white folks took their religion with great solemnity, but the people of color, they reveled in their religion and enjoyed the worship. So much so that some churches had folks falling to their knees and rolling around while the choir sang and the preacher preached. All filled with the spirit of the Lord. The song considered to be the first rock and roll song, Rocket 88 by Ike Turner brought together these influences, which inspired Little Richard, Elvis Presley and others. Soon, more geographical variances were being added but it stayed rock and roll\u2026until the Beatles. The Beatles started copying these early soon to be rock and roll legends and mixed it with some of the popular radio play (pop music) when they started writing their own songs. Then when the Beatles became a little more experimental, musically, the genre was shortened to \u201crock\u201d because now classical music, Indian music and previous recordings were being mixed into the new recordings. It wasn\u2019t just the Beatles who were doing these things but they were popular, so if a lot of people knew about it it was because the Beatles did it. But shortening \u201crock and roll\u201d to \u201crock\u201d allowed hyphenated sub-genres to occur like Progressive Rock, Art Rock, Glam Rock, Punk Rock, Southern Rock, Hard Rock, Soft Rock, Heavy Metal, et al. In my opinion, \u201crock\u201d is a catch-all name for what doesn't fit neatly somewhere else like Rhythm & Blues, Gospel, Country and Western, Classical, Electronic Dance Music, etc. Where Rock & Roll identified a new blend of old music styles, Rock encompasses where that formula has taken it since 1951. If anyone has heard the interview or read the book or article, please post it for those who are interested because it was a fascinating time. Thank you for reading this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "To understand the difference it may be useful to examine what happened around the time rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was changing into rock, in 1964\u201365. There were a handful of key songs, released within a few months of each other. You Really Got Me by The Kinks had the heavily distorted power chords that later became a staple of early rock. They were doing British Pop Rock, but still the song gets mentioned a lot as the genesis of the transition.   Then came For Your Love by The Yardbirds. Another banger that came out a month before . . . Ticket to Ride, The Beatles third consecutive #1 song in the US. The rhythm is decidedly not rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. John Lennon said he wanted the band to do something \u201cheavy.\u201d The lyrics are still rock \u2019n\u2019 roll (girl trouble) but the sound was huge and seemed like something completely different. It wasn\u2019t, really, because Phil Spector had been producing this \u201chuge\u201d sound within the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll genre previously. Lennon had the Fabs reproduce Spector with layers of loud electric guitars, and later claimed they\u2019d played the \u201cfirst heavy metal song.\u201d Then came Bob Dylan\u2019s Like a Rolling Stone. The Beatles had been listening to Dylan, and Dylan had heard them, too. So he picked up a Fender Stratocaster like his hero Buddy Holly and turned his acerbic folk music into rock music. These songs were big hits by big names in popular music. People noticed. Other musicians and record producers, especially. Then this guy named Jimi Hendrix heard both of them and started to believe that the explosion of ideas he\u2019d always had about electric guitar and music might actually be commercially viable. So did Chas Chandler, bassist for The Animals, who bankrolled Jimi\u2019s first album, Are You Experienced? The music on that album was a mashup of many genres, all played on Buddy Holly\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll Stratocaster that didn\u2019t sound anything like rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Okay so what was happening? Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll before was basically considered one genre. Surf Rock, Rockabilly, whatever, if there were electric guitars and it wasn\u2019t country music or jazz, people considered it rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. The concept of \u201cgarage rock\u201d didn\u2019t exist yet, so raucous bands like The Kingsmen or The Wailers were just noisy rock \u2019n\u2019 rollers. So were The Beatles, initially, with a dab of Everly Brothers (and again, Holly) mixed in. Then between \u201965 and \u201867, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll began fragmenting into a bunch of sub-genres. Brian Wilson\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll Beach Boys put out Pet Sounds, a landmark early \u201crock\u201d album. Hendrix and bands like Jefferson Airplane were putting out \u201cpsychedelic rock.\u201d The Beatles put out Sergeant Pepper\u2019s and released no singles from the album. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll had been all about selling 45-rpm singles. Hendrix\u2019 first LP spawned no Top-10 singles in the US, yet it was the top-selling album of 1968. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll didn\u2019t completely die, though. It just became one of the many sub-genres of \u201crock\u201d as the music form expanded to incorporate other influences. Blues Rock was really big. Country Rock became a thing. Keyboardists started playing through guitar amps and all the weird scales they knew became Metal and Prog Rock. The list goes on, but basically anything with an electric guitar featured gets the \u201cRock\u201d moniker.  These rock-n-rollers played right before Hendrix at Woodstock in 1969. So. The rock \u2019n\u2019 roll genre has features from swing and jump blues, doo wop and country music. It\u2019s fairly recognizable for its first-person lyrics about love and cars and some very familiar chord progressions. If it sounds like Buddy Holly or Chuck Berry, it\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Holly\u2019s rock-band combo The Crickets was the ne plus ultra of the genre. And people can almost always dance to it. Then there\u2019s all the electric-guitar stuff that happened after mid-\u201965, Ticket to Ride, Like a Rolling Stone and Hendrix\u2019 Purple Haze. That\u2019s not rock \u2019n\u2019 roll any more. It\u2019s a big, convoluted mass of genres intermixing under an umbrella term called \u201cRock.\u201d And people usually listen to it. ",
