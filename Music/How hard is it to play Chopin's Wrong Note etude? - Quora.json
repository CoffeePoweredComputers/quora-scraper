            "answer_text": "In comparison to the Bach C Minor prelude, it\u2019s a hell of a lot harder. The main challenges of the Bach is playing the broken chords smoothly at high tempo while still being able to voice the melody in the pinky. However, most of the piece is just basic chords that are broken up with nothing particularly tricky or hard. Once you get it under the hands, it\u2019s pretty easy to get up to tempo. The Wrong Note etude on the other hand, is a whole different beast. The A section has a lot of awkward fingering around the weird dissonant chords. Not only it requires advance techniques in wrist movement, fingering, voicing, phrasing and dynamics, all of these things have to be played at a very fast tempo of vivace or around 180 quarter note bpm. Moving to the B section, the right hand plays arpeggiated chords that are similar to the Op. 10, No. 1 Etude while the left hand plays the melody. Here is where that wrist movement, voicing and dynamics really come into play. Good luck with those arpeggios if you don\u2019t have proper wrist technique. You can kiss that melody in the left hand goodbye when it flies deep into the cascade of notes being the only thing an audience will hear if you have bad voicing, phrasing and dynamics. It\u2019s a big jump from the Bach to the Etude. The Bach is more of a beginner to entry-intermediate level piece. The Etude on the other hand is for advance players that have studied for years. If you\u2019re at the C minor Prelude\u2019s level, I would recommend waiting for another few years. ",

            "answer_text": "\u00c9tude Op.25 no.5 \u2018Wrong Note\u2019 is more difficult than the Bach Prelude and Fugue. Compared to the other Chopin Etudes, it is of moderate difficulty. The difficulty of the Etude lies in its awkward hand movements in the exposition by having to play the quick, dissonant minor seconds that give the Etude it's name. The E Major middle section also poses hidden challenges with its quick arpeggios and chords. I have played the Prelude and Fugue and attempted the Etude, and I would say the Etude is quite a bit more difficult. ",
