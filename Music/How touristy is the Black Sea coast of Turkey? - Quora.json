I will put here some pictures from the Black Sea Coastals.

I hope you enjoyed them: Begendik Beach at just the border of Bulgaria; in Igneada Demirkoy Kirklareli The Rezve River is the bordering Bulgaria and Turkey. You saw the building, these are the Rezovo Town of Bulgaria. As you can see; if you have a few paddle and swim to there you may reach, it is so close. But of course it is not possible.

If you go there in May you will see all these yellowish sand covered by the Red Poppy Flower which you can see a sample at the second picture. But be sure the sample is not reflect the reality.

My mother experienced that Igneada climate and weather became good for her asthma. At the following pictures you may see the beauty of green. All around Igneada is so green. Guess what happen? The existing government decided to build a Nuclear Power Plant. Money was over in the budget, so they could not attempt this madness. God blessed us. Unfortunately there is two Nuclear Power Plant project which started to build, one is again in a green area, almost you can say sea of forest or sea of green; in Sinop.

Salihbey Mosque built in 1792 - Artvin   Offroad - Artvin  Fish Lake - Artvin      Arsiyan Plateau Lakes Region and Floating Islands - Artvin               Macahel - Artvin Why should you visit Macahel? There is many reasons. Let i start. ( For Macahel part, i would like to send my greetings and my most sincere thanks for these knowledge to Duygu and Bilgehan who is the owner of NOMADDICTION | Travel & Experience Blog . At the end of my answer i found this website. It is so joyful and informative. I would like to thank for all those to them because of their love about traveling and learning. Since I used the information there in this section, I wanted their labor to be known. Thank you again, Duygu and Bilgehan. Thanks to you, I learned it. I really sent you my most sincere wishes. Turkey's precisely where it ends. Lower portion of Macahel are in Georgia and upper part of it in Turkey. Even it is the name of the region it has a meaning. Macahel means in Georgian hand and/or wrist. It takes its name from Camili Village in the center and 5 villages located similarly to 5 fingers around it: Duzenli, Efeler, Kayalar, Ugurkoy and Maral. Most of the people\u2019s native language is Georgian and the people learns Turkish when they start to school. Macahel known its name with Turkey's proprietary bio-reserve area. According to the definition of UNESCO; biosphere reserves are the areas where practices for protecting biodiversity, economic development and conservation of cultural values \u200b\u200bare tried, selected, presented and developed. Here Macahel is one of only 4000 odd bio-reserves in the world. Think of the importance. What is more ? Macahel is the only place in Turkey where the Caucasian race of bees lives. The feature of this bee is that, with their longer tongue, they can reach to the pollens even at the bottom of pollen plants. So they can collect more pollen comparing to the other bees, they produces 1.5 times more honey and can collect pollen from places where other bee breeds cannot. Turkey has the second largest bee population in whole world. But they are not so productive when we compare it other beekeeping and honey producing countries. In other words, despite the possibilities at hand, efficiency in production cannot be achieved. TEMA Foundation is also working to reproduce this specific bee species in this region. They organize seminars that raise awareness of beekeepers and honey producers, teach methods to increase efficiency, and try to expand the Caucasian bee race in the beekeeping industry. Turkey\u2019s main problem of beekeeping is that we have three bee races in the rest of our country but uneducated beekeeper mixed the races and this resulted with less production of honey. What can be said for Macahel is not limited by its nature. We should also talk about the environmentally conscious people of this place: Think of a place; the beekeeper said, \"Women should be positive discrimination,\" and the peasant says, \"If I use chemical in the field, when my neighbor's bee is put, he mixes with his honey, goes down to the ground with rain, mixes into the groundwater, drinks the animals that live there, chaining the entire ecosystem collapses.\" Imagine such a place that even in a village where 6 families live, the level of education is high enough to attract 26 university graduates. In Artvin's Camili Village, there is the Macahel Elders Polyphonic Choir, consisting of local artists with an average age of 68, and this choir is registered as a \"Living Human Treasure\" by UNESCO. Each individual of the choir is registered in the Living Human Treasure. Nobody in the choir has received professional music training. They attend village weddings and ceremonies and sing polyphonic Macahel songs. So on if you have time i strongly advise you to go Macahel and be part of it for a time.

LOL             Hopa - Artvin This is the end of Turkey and beginning of Georgia.       Dear Tufshin Dash it is the end. You saw Black Sea Coast of Turkey. You decide it, if it touristy or not. On my mind this coast is a golden mine for tourists. Because it is hidden treasure, just the natives of Turkey knew its beauty. Approximately 11 or 12 years ago me and my wife decided to do a long trip which contain all of these beautiful coast. But unfortunately we could not. I hope soon we can do this great jorney to the whole Black Sea Coast. Even some parts we went many times, but whole of it, no we could not. Hope we do soon. Maybe you want to join us. Maybe you will do this Black Sea tour alone in the order which i sent you. I hope you will. It's a wonderful place. No need to go to Amazon, Africa or the island of Borneo to see the rainforest. It is a place that has been raining for a great part of the year, a lot of snow in winter, a place where you can swim on its beautiful beaches, a place where history meets nature, a place with warm and cheerful people; It is a very special place. It is so rich in beauty that unfortunately I could not mention its unique cuisine, folklore and culture. Come on, ask me one more question. Ask the Black Sea cuisine in this question. Let me tell you about the unique dishes of each province in the Black Sea. And last, i hope you enjoy from all which i share you. ",

We went in September and it was great. The south coast offers more all round warmth and is extremely popular as a result. ",
