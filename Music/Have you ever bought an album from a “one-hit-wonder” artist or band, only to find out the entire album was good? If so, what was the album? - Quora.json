            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve bought a bunch that were the only hit someone had at the time, including both Thomas Dolby and Joan Osborne (mentioned in other answers). But let me add on a few of others: Wall of Voodoo. Mexican Radio was the hit, but the album Call of the West was terrific and I\u2019ve also bought Stan Ridgway\u2019s solo albums.Big Country. The hit was In a Big Country, from Crossing. I could never figure out why these guys weren\u2019t more popular.Blind Melon. No Rain was a huge hit. The rest of the eponymous album is also good, particularly Tones of Home.Chumbawumba. Tubthumping, of course. It\u2019s not for everyone. But if you liked the hit, you\u2019ll probably really like the rest of the album.Marshall Crenshaw. Someday, Someway was the single from his first album that was his only chart hit. But There She Goes Again and the transcendent pop song Cynical Girl make his self-titled first album one of my all-time favorites. The followup, Field Day, is just as good.Al Stewart. A lot of people only know Year of the Cat, but the rest of the album has more of his slightly quirky songs and Peter White\u2019s terrific guitar.Animal Logic, Animal Logic. There wasn\u2019t even really a \u201chit\u201d from this \u2014 nothing cracked the Billboard charts \u2014 but There\u2019s a Spy (In the House of Love) got a fair bit of airplay, and the album by Police drummer Stewart Copeland, jazz bass virtuoso Stanley Clarke and singer/songwriter Deborah Holland is full of terrific songs.Beth Orton, Central Reservation. The title song from this album kind of stretches the definition of \u201chit\u201d, topping out at 110 in Billboard, but it\u2019s a wonderful, ethereal, strange album. I think her voice is probably a \u201clove it or hate it\u201d proposition, but I love it.Camper van Beethoven, Telephone Free Landslide Victory. It had what\u2019s been pretty much their only hit, Take the Skinheads Bowling, but there\u2019s a lot to like here including the Eastern European/folkie Balalaika Gap and the laconic Where the Hell Is Bill?Duncan Sheik, Duncan Sheik. There was a period where it seemed like you could hear Barely Breathing everywhere you went, but Sheik never seemed to be able to capitalize on it. There\u2019s other terrific stuff on this album in the same vein, though, particularly She Runs Away and Days Go By.Fountains of Wayne, Welcome Interstate Managers. Stacey\u2019s Mom was full of pop hooks and a little bit subversive. The rest of the album is much the same, with a couple of more laid back tracks like Valley Winter Song and Halley\u2019s Waitress (which is a terrific image), then there\u2019s also Bright Future in Sales which is reminiscent of Timbuk3\u2019s The Future\u2019s So Bright (I Gotta Wear Shades) in sentiment, if not aurally.Ian Dury, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll. Dury was a real punk. He survived polio as a child, though it left him with a withered left arm and leg. A lot of his songs were, to be blunt, rather rude. Many were about sex, and not in a polite way. Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick was the hit, but the title song and Reasons to be Cheerful (Part 3) are also great.Jill Sobule, Underdog Victorious. This is kind of a cheat. Her (minor) hit was I Kissed a Girl (much better than the Katy Perry tune), but I didn\u2019t buy that album. I remembered the song, though, and when this came out I grabbed it. Cinnamon Park is, well, let\u2019s say \u201crelated to\u201d Chicago\u2019s Saturday in the Park in a nice way. I Saw a Cop is just fun.Karla Bonoff, Karla Bonoff. This is out of the Jackson Browne/early Eagles/Linda Ronstadt California sound. She had a couple of hits later, but I picked up this album after learning that she wrote Someone to Lay Down Beside Me, that Ronstadt had a big hit with.The Nields, Gotta Get Over Greta. Best Black Dress was a modest hit and intrigued me enough to buy the album. The title track is also great, and the rest is interesting.",

            "answer_text": "Marcy Playground\u2019s self-titled album.  One night a few year\u2019s ago my wife and I were listening the 90s station on satellite radio, as we often do, riding in the car. The song Sex and Candy came on again, which I was never really into. In fact I found it kind of annoying, even when I when I was hearing it on the the radio back in the 90s. I\u2019m not sure why, though. Maybe it was the nonsensical lyrics or the singer\u2019s slacker-like tone he was singing in. But that night I got to thinking about that song, I turned to my wife and mused, \u201cI wonder what the rest of this album sounds like.\u201d I got ahold of the album and popped it on and I was honestly blown away. The album jams from beginning to end. Okay, there are some slower, somber moments within, but ultimately most, if not all, the songs are so catchy and fun to sing out loud. John Wozniak\u2019s vocal range is fairly attainable, so it\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re singing correctly. The opener Poppies is a fantastic 90s rock-out anthem, as is Saint Joe on the School Bus (the albums other single, which you never hear). Ancient Walls of Flowers and A Cloak of Elvenkind have me pulling out my accoustic bass to strum and sing along. And the closers The Shadows of Seattle and Vampires of New York will be stuck in your head long after the album is finished. I was so blown away by the whole of this album it changed the way I feel about the song Sex and Candy. As I now see the bigger picture I no longer find it annoying and I absolutely love that song now. ",

            "answer_text": "I actually heard this album before I bought it, but the one that comes to mind for me is Starring In\u2026Standing In A Monkey Sea by A\u2019me Lorain and the Family Affair. A\u2019me Lorain\u2019s big hit was called \u201cWhole Wide World\u201d. It doesn\u2019t get played much on the radio these days, but it was a top ten hit in 1990, from the film True Love. Paula Abdul was a superstar at the time, and \u201cWhole Wide World\u201d was written and produced by Elliot Wolff, who had done the same for Abdul\u2019s hits \u201cStraight Up\u201d and \u201cCold Hearted\u201d. \u201cWhole Wide World\u201d sounded a LOT like Abdul\u2019s hits, even sporting a male vocal part that kind of reminded me of Abdul\u2019s \u201cOpposites Attract\u201d (although Wolff wasn\u2019t involved with that one). I liked it, probably more than Abdul\u2019s own hits, but it was a bit derivative.  I was working at a radio station in New Hampshire at the time, and we received a copy of the CD she put out. Even just looking at the cover, it didn\u2019t quite fit with the single:  It was credited in part to a group, which the single wasn\u2019t; she wasn\u2019t made up to look so glamorous, and the whole thing gave a kind of psychedelic vibe. So I played it (actually, a colleague and I put it on), and I loved it. \u201cWhole Wide World\u201d and the follow-up single, \u201cFollow My Heartbeat\u201d, were Wolff\u2019s songs and fit the Paula Abdul sound, but the rest of it definitely did not. The album was much more adventurous, diverse, and interesting than that. And FUN! Even \u201cWhole Wide World\u201d had a new spoken intro that put a different spin on it. Anyway, I had some trouble finding the album on vinyl, which is what I collected in those days, but I finally snagged it on a trip to Montreal. It\u2019s been a favorite of mine ever since. For me the standout tracks are \u201cUnique Blue Tube\u201d, a power-pop infused song that suggests The Bangles with more of a dance beat, and the funky, Prince-influenced \u201cLetter \u2018C\u2019 Card\u201d. \u201cTime You Take\u201d is another good one, which might have been a better choice for a second single than \u201cFollow My Heartbeat\u201d; it was commercial and fit reasonably well with the sound of the hit, but was different enough that it wouldn\u2019t have just seemed like another Abdul knockoff. There\u2019s definitely an undercurrent of psychedelia through a lot of the album, as well. Unfortunately, \u201cFollow My Heartbeat\u201d flopped, the album didn\u2019t chart, and as far as I know A\u2019Me Lorain (real name Amy Trujillo) never made another record. If you\u2019re a fan of the dance-pop of that time and enjoy a bit of diversity in the sound, I\u2019d recommend it as worth checking out. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, here are a couple from the 70\u2019s that meet this criteria. Rick Derringer- All American Boy from 1973. This contain the huge hit, Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (#23 on Billboard). It was his solo debut and contained several other strong songs including Teenage Queen, Cheap Tequila, The Airport Giveth, Uncomplicated and Teenage Love Affair. He is a great guitarist and this album shows it off. He had several more albums but never came close to a top 40 song again. Albert Hammond- It Never Rains In Southern California from 1973. The title song was a big hit for him (#5 on Billboard) and the rest of the album doesn\u2019t disappoint. It\u2019s singer-songwriter all the way and the songs are super catchy. Check out If You Gotta Break Another Heart, Brand New Day, Names Tags Numbers and Labels or The Air That I Breathe (later a hit for The Hollies). He continued to release albums, but with nowhere near the success. Thunderclap Newman- Hollywood Dream from 1970. This contained the hit Something In The Air (#37 on Billboard) which has been in many moves and a staple of FM radio since. The rest of the album contains stellar rock songs sung by \u201cSpeedy\u201d Keene. Some of my favorites include Accidents, Hollywood Dream, Open The Door Homer and Look Around. Unfortunately, this was the only album they released. ",

            "answer_text": "This question was tailor-made for me on a lazy night like this. A couple of artists were already named, but different albums than I would recommend: Thomas Dolby - Aliens Ate My Buick: From the opening jazzy riffs morphing into an Our Man Flint/60s Spy cavalcade (complete with Robin Leach talk-in) of The Keys to Her Ferrari to the percolating Air Head to the undulating breeziness of The Ability to Swing and the dream-like opus, Budapest by Blimp, Dolby really showed musical chops I never knew he had. The album cover is fantastic - a take-off of 1950s drive-in B-movie schlock. To be honest, that\u2019s the whole reason I bought the album back in 1987 because I was thinking something unusual had to be on it, what with She Blinded Me With Science being such a big hit a few years previous. Top of the list as far as this question goes, for me. Wall of Voodoo - Happy Planet: I had begun the transition from just listening to prog and hard rock when I arrived for my freshman year of college in 1984 and was indoctrinated with what was known as \u201ccollege rock - a proto-Indie movement with fingers still firmly in the New Wave pie. Bands such as U2, R.E.M., The Smiths, The Church, The Replacements, et al, were part of that scene, as was W.O.V. as a hanger-on, a modest foothold on its street cred with Mexican Radio earlier in the decade. I bought this album without looking at the song list. Of particular note is the song, Joanne, which is everything fun and anachronistic about music from the 80s. The Church - Starfish: Unpredictably, it wasn\u2019t Under the Milky Way which drove me to the music of Australia\u2019s The Church, it was the song Reptile. The music scene where I went to college (University of Delaware) in the 1980s was, in a word, fun. One of the top covers bands on the middle of the East Coast was called Y-Not, and they covered Reptile from this album, albeit with keyboards providing the staccato riffs of The Church\u2019s Marty Willson-Piper\u2019s guitar. Y-Not did a high-energy version of the song, so I bought the album where it originated, and all the albums of theirs prior to that and many after. I\u2019ve seen The Church in concert more often than any other touring band, and lead singer/bassist/founder Steve Kilbey still tours and will probably tour again after it is deemed safe to do so, both solo and with The Church. He is also a Facebook friend of mine and we have had brief conversations. Just a very chill bloke - immensely talented, intense, with an almost whimsical cynicism that I find refreshing. The whole album is packed with great songs, as are most of the others I eventually found my way to purchasing. Controversy alert: The Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots: They can\u2019t all be from the 80s, can they? The big hit was, of course, Do You Realize??, even though their instrumental from that album, Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia), won a Grammy for Best Instrumental, the latter was largely unknown. Note: I am not including She Don\u2019t Use Jelly from the early 1990s because I had never heard it until well after I bought this album. The whole album is such a complete confectionery treat for the ears, as if Willy Wonka had a band. They continued their tradition of convoluted song titles with In the Morning of The Magicians, Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell, Fight Test, and what I consider the most superior aural experience on the album, Are You a Hypnotist?? Others might offer up Race for the Prize or Waitin\u2019 On a Superman from The Soft Bulletin, but, for me, my first exposure to The \u2018Lips was Do You Realize?? as I gather it was for others not hard-wired into the Indie scene as it existed at the end of the 20th Century when I basically unplugged from the increasingly vapid new music scene.

            "answer_text": "A couple of times, although at the time these artists caught my ear, no one considered them \u201cone hit wonders\u201d. I was a science-loving nerd in the early 80\u2019s, so \u201cShe Blinded Me With Science\u201d was right up my alley. I purchased the album, The Golden Age of Wireless, and was blown away by how good all the songs were. None of them was all that much like SBMWS, and I became a lifelong fan of Thomas Dolby. Most people have only heard his one hit, but he has a bunch of amazing albums, and almost none of it is the sort of synth-pop people associate with him. Move along a few decades or so, and there was slight, funny pop song on the radio called \u201cOne of Us\u201d, sung by Joan Osborne. Maybe I was at a Tower Records or something, and they had a listening station for the album, Relish. Anyway, I listened to the first track, \u201cSt. Teresa\u201d, and again, I wasn\u2019t expecting THAT! Joan is an bluesy belter, and most of the songs sounded NOTHING like her sole radio hit, but she\u2019s a terrific singer, and two of the guys who worked on her album and sound were Rob Hyman and Eric Bazilian (ap?) from the Hooters, who worked in a similar fashion on a seminal 80\u2019s album, Cyndi Lauper\u2019s She\u2019s So Unusual! The important lesson is that many terrific musicians may only catch lightning in a bottle that one time, but just because they may not have found long-term success, it doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t make great music!

            "answer_text": "Yes. Back in the early 90\u2019s I was into alternative rock especially bands out of Seattle (Nirvana, Mudhoney, etc). Someone left a CD from the band \u201cHole\u201d at my place. No idea how it got there but I lived with three other 20-something guys and there were always people hanging at our place. Anyways, I was staunchly against \u201cHole\u201d because of lead singer Courtney Love and the caustic relationship she had with Kurt Cobain. Nothing personal with her- but she got a lot of the blame for Kurts demise whether true or not. I also thought she probably got a record deal because of her relationship with Cobain. It was a completely unfair and unfounded prejudice against her. I drove a car with a CD player- this is pre-internet and cell phone- and on a road trip it was easy to lose radio station signals. I couldn\u2019t find my usual thick folder of CDs in the car except one- the CD/album \u201cLive Through This\u201d by Hole. With nothing else to listen to, I decided to give it a try. Turned out to be a an amazing rock album. Great songs from start to finish. I loved it. Music is a very personal taste but for me, this album was tight. I was stunned and I gained a new respect for Courtney Love\u2019s musical talent and still have Hole in my Spotify 90\u2019s rotation. ",

But the rest of their album We Care is really good too. Their lead singer was really sexy in an off-the-wall way, and they had a weird sound that no other band could really replicate.   Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth made a classic hip hop one-hit wonder with \u201cThey Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),\u201d but the rest of the album, Mecca and the Soul Brother, is really tight with no filler. I love the line in \u201cThe Basement\u201d: \u201cI make music for my peoples./I get large like the Beatles.\u201d If you like jazzier 1990s hip hop like A Tribe Called Quest, you\u2019re in for a treat with Mecca and the Soul Brother.   Blue Cheer had a one-hit wonder back in 1968 with a psychedelicized version of Eddie Cochran\u2019s \u201cSummertime Blues,\u201d but the album it belongs to, Vincebus Eruptum, is just as good. My copy is some scratchy copy I found in a bargain bin for $3.98, but you literally can\u2019t hear any scratches, because the record is just so frickin\u2019 loud! They were a psychedelic San Francisco band, but they had a hard biker edge to them. They were even managed by a Hell\u2019s Angel who was only known by the name Gut. Their version of \u201cSummertime Blues\u201d hit #14 on the charts, winning them a slot on American Bandstand, but they got permanently banned after their only appearance after Dick Clark caught them smoking a bowl of hashish in their dressing room. If you listen to Vincebus Eruptum, you can hear both elements of a grunge and heavy metal, neither of which really existed at the time.   Bubble Puppy was the most commercially successful of all those crazy Austin, Texas psych bands that were in the same scene as The 13th Floor Elevators, even though they only had one Top 20 hit with \u201cHot Smoke and Sassafras.\u201d On the album cover of A Gathering of Promises, they look like they fled stoned from a Renaissance Faire, but the album shows they know how to rock.   Love is no mere one-hit wonder to me. They\u2019re one of my favorite bands of all time, but they technically only have one Top Forty hit, \u201cSeven and Seven Is,\u201d off the album Da Capo. Side 2 is a side long jam, but I like it, and the rest of the album is good, not just the hit. The track \u201cShe Comes In Colours\u201d is especially influential, because it conceptually inspired the Rolling Stones, \u201cShe\u2019s a Rainbow\u201d and Madonna ripped off the melody for \u201cBeautiful Stranger.\u201d   ",

It blew me away in 1980 and I still follow this guy, though the closest he\u2019s come to a hit since was \u201cHail, Hail, Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u201d in 1991. But his 6th album produced a Billboard Top 100 single in the U.S. He never got close before or since. He\u2019s still recording genius albums, but most of you haven't heard of him. I\u2019m talking about Garland Jeffreys. Born in Sheepshead Bay, BK, NY, of a truly American heritage, African-American and Puerto Rican, and plays a mix of Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll, Blues, R&B, Soul, Reggae and, at that time, Alternative/Punk. The album that made me a fan for life was this one: Garland Jeffreys: Escape Artist (1980)  Just keep playing the album in order\u2026.you\u2019ll get it. The big hit was a remake of a ? & The Mysterious hit, \u201c96 Tears\u201d, but it was far from the best song on the album. ",

Everyone knows \u201cKeep Your Hands To Yourself\u201d, but they were actually a really outstanding Southern Rock outfit. Kind of reminded me of Lynyrd Skynyrd without sounding a whole lot like them. Nearly every song on that debut album is great, especially Battleship Chains, their cover of Every Picture Tells A Story, Nights Of Mystery, Railroad Steel, and since I\u2019m a Firebird aficionado, of course Red Light (\u201cThat Firebird flew like it just grew wings\u201d). Saw them open for Bob Seger that summer, and they honestly blew him off the stage. One of the only times I\u2019d seen a headliner rush to take the stage after the opening act - he didn\u2019t give them a full minute when they left regardless of the fact that the auditorium was screaming for an encore. Besides being an overall solid band, Dan Baird is a talented songwriter. I always figured his solo career fizzled mostly because he\u2019s not the handsomest guy at a time when that started to be the determining factor. He did have a solo hit with \u201cI Love You Period\u201d, but that was pretty much it. ",

Of course they didn't remain a one-hit artist and were actually a bigger act in their homeland Holand but unheard of here in the states at the time. The album to this day remains one of the best album start to finish. The \u2018Yes\u2019 album \u201cFragile\u201d was just amazing\u2026I had heard them before and I'd enjoyed them but when \u2018Roundabout\u2019 hit the airwaves I went right out to get the record and well \u2014 we all pretty much know their history from that point on. The \u201cYear of the Cat\u201d album by Al Stuart was another one I felt that way about. Some great songs and fantastic guitar work by Peter White. Also, the Peter Schilling album \u201cError in the System\u201d that had the song \u2018Coming Home\u2019 (Major Tom) on it. I thought it and his next album were full of great songs. And there was the \u201cOrinoco Flow\u201d by Enya\u2026 I knew her from her work with \u2018Clannad\u2019 but this album literally introduced a whole new music to the public at large. Some my love it, some hate it but it was a force that couldn't be denied nor expected when it came out. Now there have been several albums that just turned out to be great buys but for ones that were from supposed one-hit artists, these were great finds of course these didn't necessarily remains one hit artist.

That\u2019s the band who had the big #1 hit \u201cPlay That Funky Music\u201d. The album isn't Disco, it\u2019s blues & funk. In fact, they kind of rival The Commodore at their funkiest. No other hits but their version of \u201cI Feel Sanctified\u201d is awesome. P. S. - To the one who said AL Stewart was a one hit wonder. He actually had 4 hits between 1976 and 1980. \u263a\ufe0f Year Of The Cat, Time Passages, Song On The Radio and Midnight Rocks. These reached -(in order in the U S.) : #8, #7, #24 and #29, on the Hot 100. AL Stewart almost had a fifth top 40 hit with \u201cOn The Border\u201d but it stopped at #42. Also from \u2018The Year Of The Cat\u2019 LP. So really, his biggest hit is \u201cTime Passages.\u201c Weird fact : Before \u2018Cat\u2019 in 1976 and after his last hit in 1980, None of Al\u2019s singles made the Hot 100 at AL / or ever again.

But the only one that qualifies as a one-hit-wonder is Partners In Crime, by Rupert Holmes. Everyone knows Escape (The Pina Colada Song), and some may even be familiar with Him, which wasn\u2019t a huge hit, though I do hear it from time to time. But the rest of the album is filled with gems that contain great lyrics and memorable music. I especially love Lunch Hour, Drop It, Answering Machine, Get Outta Yourself, and The People That You Never Get To Love. In fact, there isn\u2019t a bad song on either side, and I will gladly listen to it over and over. Rupert Holmes has a great sense of humor that comes through in many of his songs, while others are wistful and a little sad. But the whole album is worth a listen, and I highly recommend it. ",

But, and if you\u2019re not already sick of \u201cEscape (The Pina Colada Song),\u201d or his follow-up \u201cHim,\u201d Rupert Holmes\u2019 album Partners In Crime is a favorite of mine. Yes, it\u2019s very dated. Originally released in 1979, the cover photographer did his best to try and make Rupert look like John Ritter of the then-huge hit TV sitcom Three\u2019s Company, and some of the subject matter of various songs, which might have been considered cutting-edge then, is blas\u00e9 now. Nevertheless, IMHO almost every song has a great melody, witty lyrics, is memorable, and thankfully, not as cutesy as the album\u2019s biggest hit. Plus, anyone who wears glasses will automatically love \u201cNearsighted.\u201d I recommend it to everyone. ",

They are generally classified as \u201cnew wave\u201d, but their haircuts were nothing unusual, and they had no synths. What the band \u2014 five very white lads and one black lad, all very British in their heavy wool sweaters \u2014 had, was some really bright tropical-sounding funk, with lots of brass, percussion, wacka-wacka-wacka guitar that would put Nile Rodgers to shame, and clever lyrics. The singer/guitarist and leader Nick Heyward had some successful solo albums, and the band without him put out a second album, but it flopped, and that was it for Haircut. The album also exposed me to an Irish expression \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s the craic?\u201d \u2014 whose meaning (and spelling) I did not learn until 30 years later. It is still one of my favorite albums and I listen to it now and again, especially when springtime rolls around. ",
