            "answer_text": "Initially, my bias was Ros\u00e9. Then I ended up switching to Jennie, and then Lisa. Briefly I decided my bias was Jisoo. So I have had each one of them as my bias once. I truly like all the girls and look up to each and every one in a different way. I think ultimately though, my bias is Ros\u00e9.   There is just something so pure and genuine about her that makes me love her. I personally have a passion for music. And it disappoints me seeing so many idols in the K-Pop world debuting in groups with other intentions than making music. There are so many people training to be idols, but you can tell that not everyone wants to be an idol for the rights reasons. I think people are motivated by fame and the opportunities it brings them, which just makes me incredibly frustrated. I can sympathize with some people, because I assume they become idols so that they can pursue other passions like modeling, MCing, etc. I just feel like for some idols, it is not about the music but rather the power and glory. Then I look at someone like Ros\u00e9. She has stated multiple times that music has been a huge part of her life since her childhood. She was involved in church choirs, learned how to play guitar and piano. She was a cheerleader, so she had even been learning choreography as a kid.  The reason she auditioned for YG was because her parents knew how important singing was to her. She would constantly be singing and even said in the Zach Sang Show that since she kept her family up constantly singing and playing piano, her father pushed her to become a singer. She has uploaded multiple covers of her singing and playing the guitar or piano. She talks about how her, along with the other members, have gotten more involved in the production process of BLACKPINK\u2019s songs.  BLACKPINK ROS\u00c9- Can\u2019t Help Falling In Love Cover It\u2019s obvious that she has been passionate about music since the beginning. But another thing I love about Ros\u00e9 is her love for BLINKs. We know that YG is a strict company, and that the girls of BLACKPINK do not have much freedom. However, Ros\u00e9 has never let that stop her from communicating and checking in on BLINKs. I mean I feel like every time I open Instagram, she makes a post thanking and sending love to her fans. She has done Instagram lives just to see us, and even has gotten emotional at concerts seeing all her fans and supporters. BLACKPINK Ros\u00e9 Cried On Her Way Back After Broadcast Performance | Kpopmap - Kpop, Kdrama and Trend Stories Coverage At the end of their tour, she got emotional having to leave BLINKs, and her members comforted her.  Recently, she even teared up when a fan expressed their sorrow towards Ros\u00e9 because of all the hardships she has gone through that they did not know. Ros\u00e9 immediately said it was okay and to not feel sorry for her, and started to tear up. She tried to hide it though for the BLINK\u2019s sake.  It just shows how much she loves being in BLACKPINK, making music and performing and having so many supporters. Lastly, you can just tell she is a genuine person. When you watch BLACKPINK house, interviews, variety shows, etc., you can see how pure and nice she is. She does not seem like she would say a bad word about anyone. It\u2019s like she radiates positivity and kindness. She\u2019s also incredibly down to earth. In interviews, she is constantly acknowledging the people around her, and just talking about their success with such humility. Many idols have had scandals where they are accused of being bullies or being rude. I have never heard one bad word about Park Chaeyoung\u2019s character.  I know the list is long, but Ros\u00e9 just really seems like a true, genuine person that cares greatly about her music and her fans. I am forever grateful I have her to look up to! ",

            "answer_text": "I love all of them \ud83d\udc95 Why? Here: Jisoo Jisoo is the oldest member and she takes care of every member. When they are crying, she dries their tears and supports them. She is also the mood maker of the group. Being an idol is tough and Jisoo always manage to make these girls to laugh and smile. She once wrote a letter to Lisa when she was in Real Man, a TV show. The letter was heartwarming and full of affection. It was sooo touching that it made Lisa cry. It read, \u201cLisa, it\u2019s so hot these days. I wonder how you\u2019re doing. Come back soon and let\u2019s go to eat something delicious together\u2026.I love you. Hope you come back with a smile on your face.\u201d There was also a picture of the two of them. I don\u2019t know, but this letter gives people a sense of strength and homesickness? Like, when I look at pictures of my childhood self, I wish I could go back and live those carefree days. It\u2019s a similar case with Jisoo\u2019s letter, right? It has an innocent feel. Her 4D personality is also very likable. She also has many instances that makes me go, \u201cWow! Totally relatable.\u201d  Jennie Jennie is the second oldest member. She is sweet and I love her smile. She has this gummy smile that can sometimes look childish (in a good way) and cute. Although she receives the most amount of hate, she stays strong and continues being herself and making herself a better person. Jennie is extremely talented. She can rap, sing, and dance. Jennie has wonderful stage presence on stage and is born to preform. Whether or not you disagree, there is no denying she can definitely hype up the crowd and also give off a stunning performance. Remember Solo? She slayed those dance moves and owned the stage. No stage presence? Has anybody actually been to their concerts? Or are you just saying that because you heard of it. I doubt you actually watched fancams from the concerts or did you only watch the bad ones? Every concert will have a point of the artists or groups being tired. And don\u2019t forget they are actually singing live. Jennie can make you feel excited at a concert. I\u2019ve been to Blackpink\u2019s concerts before in Chicago.  Ros\u00e9 Ros\u00e9 is the main vocalist of Blackpink. Ahh yes, she has a super unique voice. Rose (to lazy to write Ros\u00e9) can play the guitar too. I remember her singing in Masked Singer show thing (I kinda forgot the actual name), but basically she has me searching her name 100 times because I was shook at her voice and vocals. She someone makes me laugh when I saw how bored she was at an award show. The rest of the members were bored af, but Ros\u00e9 was just stating off to space and add no movements (only her hands). But her face was still as a statue and made me laugh so hard for some reason. I could relate so well, because in piano competitions\u2026after a couple people play, I get bored and just stare ahead and pretend I was paying attention. I love Ros\u00e9\u2019s fashion. It\u2019s very elegant and causal. Anyways, here is Ros\u00e9!  Lisa Lisa I the youngest member and and main dancer. Oh god, the youngest member and oldest member are two crackheads and are hilarious when they are stuck together. When I watched Blackpink House, I love how silly Lisa was and strong she is. Lisa takes care of her members (all of them do), and I remembered when the she carried Jisoo. Oh, and don\u2019t even get me started at her dancing and rapping. She is the swag queen of Blackpink (the other members also have their own unique swag too). Lisa carried herself in a way that I like a lot. My favorite moment happened in the past, but I love her taxi dance. It was entertaining and fun. Like it was catchy. At random times when I was alone, I would do the taxi dance and the person that came to mind was Lisa. Her swalla dance cover was iconic and she definitely stands out a lot! I remember her gold outfit, and I was like, \u201cWowwww!\u201d Lisa can also speak many languages. I forgot the extract number, but it was a lot. I think it was Thai, Korean, English, etc.  ",
