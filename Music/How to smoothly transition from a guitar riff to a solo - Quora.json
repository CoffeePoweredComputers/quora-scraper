            "answer_text": "If you wait for the riff to reach its end, then it sounds like you have completed something, and are starting the next thing. This sometimes works, but often, you want the solo to explode onto the song. To do this, you need to step into the solo a couple of notes before the riff finishes. The same goes for ending the solo. If you are going back into a vocal, you often want to keep the solo going right into the vocal. Both of these techniques keep the tension going. It may be the lack of tension that you\u2019re describing.  It\u2019s also worth looking at how you are starting. The most exciting way to start a solo is to use either a fast lick or a long, sustained note powered by vibrato. For some reason, an in-between tempo often doesn\u2019t do it. I suspect this is because it is simply continuing the rhythm of the song, rather than breaking away from it.  Solos fulfil all kinds of functions, but often the job of the solo is to take the melody and chords into a new direction which vocals could not follow, perhaps through speed, or extended sustain, or through the dramatic range of the guitar. Nobody can sing from the low E up to the very top D, but you can go all the way from one to the other on guitar in a couple of seconds. A guitar can be playing a melodic line, like singing, and then suddenly break into a two string bend (or a three string, if you can find a place for it). ",

            "answer_text": "Practice. Sometimes you wanna start your solo before the end of the riff, sometimes you might want it to spill over into the riff following, so you'll have to consider those possibilities and include them in your practice. Also remember, if you're having these f%!^ups at band/gig volumes, then you need to spend some practice time at these volumes. Can be pretty inconvenient or antisocial at home, but still important.  You'll have to be confident that yiur levels/sounds are easily changed if need be.  But practice.    So what to practice?  One thing that comes to mind is getting into the feeling of the solo in the preceding bars. That can lead to a better instinct of the actual note you'll want to hit, and hopefully hearing it in your head first. (This assumes you're intending to inprovise.) If you can do this then that brings me to my next point: knowing exactly where you're headed on the fretboard. It seem like an obvious thing to point out, but look at the fret and string you're heading to. You know, your riff's around A, you're playing in the 3rd position and you want to launch into a solo with a screaming bend from 15th fret 1st string G to the A, look at that 15th fret before you reach for it.  Same applies for returning to the riff. Obvs plus 1 bar riff, 1 bar solo, repeat * x  (10 mins)   ",
