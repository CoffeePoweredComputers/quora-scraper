            "answer_text": "Yes, he should. CONFESSION: I have been a Paul McCartney fan and I still enjoy many of his older works. Actually, in retrospect, Paul McCartney should have curtailed his output before he went through his \u201cBlack phase\u201d of making extremely mediocre (but lucrative) hits with Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. While his Give My Regards to Broad Street was a strong outing, he has consistently failed to create listenable music in almost 30 years. For most other artists, this would have meant either retiring from the business or going on tour playing the greatest hits for their legions of hard core fans. However, since McCartney was one of The Beatles and had such strong success both as a solo artist and with the band Wings in the 1970s, he has been able to continue to force his way onto the stage and into the spotlight. McCartney is a wealthy man who has created some of the best pop music in the last 75 years. Unless he can escape from his current funk and begin to create material at least as good the songs he was able to write in the early to mid 1970s, he should retire if for no other reason than to protect his legacy.

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is the same response I had when I read a quote from Madonna who said \"I can't imagine going up on stage and just singing. It just seems so boring\". As others have said, the love people have for McCartney involves the reminiscing of their youth, having a positive attitude and feeling of optimistic, and loving not only the songs of the person, but who the person is. Paul could go out there by himself and sit on a stool with an acoustic guitar and only one light, and sing in a voice that is unfortunately  missing a few notes from the range he used to have, and still draw thousands of people. He doesn't need any gimmicks. That's something Madonna just doesn't get and it's what people are thinking when asked if Paul should retire or not. ",
