            "answer_text": "It provides a place for music producers and consumers to come together and experience something special. Your friendly neighborhood player. The Internet used to be an ugly place for music. Sure, MySpace existed. But my eyes were sensitive to glitter and their player took way too long to get going. Each website used a different music player. Some required plugins, others never worked. Some were just impossible to understand. Once SoundCloud happened, you always knew what hitting that orange play button would do. It was familiar. Soon, it became your friend. Music blogs were the first to fall in love. Content producers love the stats. Producers love this feature. Who doesn't want to know how many Liechtensteinians are listening to your mixtape? Besides, artists can now use it for getting gigs. Saying that you should get a gig somewhere cause you have mad listeners there helps make a stronger case in getting booked. Sweet social media integration. It would suck if clicking a link took you out of your Facebook or Twitter window. Who wants multiple tabs anyway? The embedded player lets you listen to stuff while checking out who your friend Jane is going out with. Listen to music when your boss isn't looking. Besides dropping the occasional embarrassing track, Pandora isn't available in every region. On SoundCloud, by following artists you get a feed full of fresh music. Just hit play and carry on with your work. One track ends, another begins. No client download means you don't have to spar with IT. Meetups are chill as hell. Have you met these guys? They're fun to hang out with. I was in Austin for SXSW last year. One evening, SoundCloud tweets about a meetup happening at a bar nearby. I went, met some chill peeps, and hopped random food trucks for the rest of the night. Did I say they give away sweet swag? A community of people that can relate to your taste. When I discovered SoundCloud, it was the community that made me stay. All these people were making interesting music, sharing samples and dropping mixtapes. Music enthusiasts are all too familiar with that feeling of telling someone about a track they've never heard of only to get blank stares. But now you could talk to people who spoke your language. You could ask an artist what their favorite color was. That was special. Show off your sweet taste (or the lack of it). Show off your fantastic taste in music? Sure, why not. That's exactly what  your profile does by showing what you've favorited and commented on. Favoriting tracks is so cool! It's like Foursquare. You're leaving your mark on the world. At some point, you'll be able to go through your history and see what you were into \"back then.\" Timed comments means you can comment on parts you like. The waveform is ultra cool. A sick drop in a track can cause a flood of emotions. One release is to dance to it. Another is to comment \"SICKK DROP BRO!!.\" Now why doesn't YouTube allow it?  It's a source for great music! This is why I keep coming back. The \"upcoming\" producers are genuine and just want to make good music. No label pressures means people are unafraid of experimenting. If it weren't for SoundCloud, I wouldn't have found Chris Malinchak, Bestrack or Chris Jylkke. By providing a haven to enjoy great music and feel like a part of something cool, SoundCloud takes up a special place in people's hearts. Now, if they can get rid of all these fake accounts... Niche labels can build their scene. Labels, such as the New York-based FRENCH EXPRESS, have built a solid reputation in the electronic music scene lately. With a slew of talented artists under their wing, they've used SoundCloud as a platform to announce single, album and mixtape releases. Every now and then, they build anticipation on Facebook for free stuff (\"If this track gets 20,000 plays we're giving it out for free.\"). Clear and easy sharing for producers. Email doesn't let you send high-quality tracks. And Mediafire doesn't give you any stats. SoundCloud lets you upload private tracks and share them with friends, labels and DJs. The uploading process is straightforward and gives you control over the metadata for your music. Tag it. Picture it. Share it. Show off your music through the iPhone app. You're at a friend's place and need some music. Just plug in your iPhone, go to your favorites and drop that mixtape that you've been digging lately. Boom. ORANGE. Need I say more?   ",

            "answer_text": "Right from the moment SoundCloud was conceived, we had one goal in mind. To make it as easy for you to upload and share your music. The vision was that you could put a track up on SoundCloud and make that the one place from which you could weave your music across the rich tapestry of the web. An essential part of that tapestry is the blogosphere. I think that SoundCloud is the best way to get music onto blogs and here\u2019s 5 reasons why. 1) SoundCloud is beautifully simple It\u2019s so easy to get started. Set up a free account and upload your music in any audio format. You can add as much or as little metadata as you want including a description, buy links, video links, and release dates 2) Our players are the best in town Our classic waveform player is now ubiquitous across the web. You\u2019ve probably seen it quite a bit recently. But we\u2019ve added two other players* specifically with bloggers and websites it mind. There\u2019s the minimal player which we stripped back as much as possible. It\u2019s literally just a play button next to artist name and track title. And there\u2019s the artwork player. You\u2019ve probably guessed already\u2026 it\u2019s literally just your artwork, with a play button. So it looks beautiful on the page and the blogger doesn\u2019t even need to add any cover art themselves. It\u2019s right there, as the player. 3) SoundCloud plays nice with The Hype Machine SoundCloud is the only service that has a streaming music player that The Hype Machine can detect across the blogs that it aggregates. This means that a music blogger can grab your music from SoundCloud and can customize and embed a beautiful player in a post, knowing that it will still show up on The Hype Machine. And it\u2019s much nicer than having to send them an MP3 link or re-hosting it on one of those nasty generic file sharing sites. 4) Geek out on stats, stats and more stats Let\u2019s be honest, who doesn\u2019t like geeking out on stats? Who\u2019s playing your music, which blogs are raving about it, what are your most popular tracks, how many times has that free track been downloaded? SoundCloud can now answer those questions. You can see how many plays/downloads came from which blogs and where in the world those listeners are*. And because The Hype Machine now plays tracks back directly from your SoundCloud account we know how many times it has been played there too. 5) It\u2019s easy for bloggers We\u2019re trying to make it as easy as possible for bloggers to share your music. Many are already using our private or group dropboxes to receive music. Just some of the things we\u2019ve done include making it possible to share a player to Blogger with just a couple of clicks, working with WordPress.com to have an official integration, allowing customization of our players, and of course the partnership with The Hype Machine. Of course we can\u2019t force anyone to write about your music, but we can make it as easy as possible for you to share the music if they do want to. ",
