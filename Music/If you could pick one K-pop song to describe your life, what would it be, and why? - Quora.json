I forgive them but I know that I am going to get hurt again. I hated this sooooo much that I got depression. And everyday I would say to my self \u201c nobody in this world is EVER truly love tou and be with you\u201d. I got cyberbullied by my own close friends. They betrayed me. They talked sh*t about me and they even said \u201c eluney should go to hell for being such a bit*ch\u201d And then my aunt got cancer. My dad got me in trouble for no reason which stressed me out so bad because I guess I am the type of girl that hates to be threatened for no reason. But then again I know I am going to get hurt by the same people if I try to go back to them. The same people do not know how I feel inside. So this is a little bit about my life but I have a story that will go on way more and most of that causes my to almost kill myself. ",
