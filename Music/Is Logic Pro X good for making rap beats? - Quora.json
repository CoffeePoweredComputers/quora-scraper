            "answer_text": "Short answer YES. Using the piano roll for kick and high hats, snare can take a little getting use to.. but you can do triplet (really fast high hats) and rolling your 808s with a little practice and a few YouTube lessons. But Logic Pro X is awesome for editing and also building great quality sounds with tons of built in sounds and a massive sound library. Here is a great tip: Get a subscription to splice. $9 per month and well worth it.. tons of sounds and getting better by the day. Use their beatmaker tool. It has a great template to create the \u201cbeat\u201d part of your song and easy way to get a loop started. Then you can export that midi file to a logic project (you will need to edit the key trigger on your piano roll or you can drag the notes where you want). But that has been my go to now to get a loop started and use an FL studio like beat grid (which is more hip hop friendly) and move it to a powerhouse DAW like Logic Pro X that is a great \u201csong production\u201d software. Then you can build from there. ",
