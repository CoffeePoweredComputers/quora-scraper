            "answer_text": "LMMS is an awesome free piece of software though you can't compare to paid DAWs like FL which are miles apart in development. But yeah comparing the software here are some stuffs which you can do both in LMMS and FL. They are-1. Song composition2.Making beats using step sequencer3.Song Arrangements4.Using automation for sound designs5. Using virtual instruments (vst plugins)6.Using Effects like Equaliser, Reverb, compressor etc..And much more... so basically what I'm saying is you've got all the tool needed to create a song in LMMS. The only drawback I find in LMMS is you can't directly record audio in LMMS but you can always use a free software like audacity, record it there and import it in LMMS. LMMS is the closest thing you can get to FL and it's free so if someday you would like to upgrade to FL it will be an ease for you.  And yeah check out the best song I've ever listed from a LMMS user called Central Beats it's damn freaking good  ",

            "answer_text": "Hands down it will be FL Studio. It just has more features and a better workflow. But, LMMS is a pretty good alternative for free. Although there are some features it lacks. For example, here are a few; You can only add Virtual Instrument tracks to the FX-mixer/mixing console.You can\u2019t record live audio (instruments/vocals)Maybe not \u201clacking\u201d but you can only put one plugin/sample/automation clip type per track, it\u2019s not based on a channel-rack-system like FL Studio.If those are something you can handle, here is a tutorial for LMMS to get you started:  ",
