            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t even going to answer this but I read an answer that was written so irresponsibly that it used nothing but sheer speculation in saying the moderator controls both contestants too much in a virtual debate. It also described the first debate between President Trump and Joe Biden as \u201ca good example.\u201d What the hell? If that was \u201cgood\u201d I\u2019d hate to see bad! As for the amount of control, what control do you mean? That debate was not even close to being in control. It was sloppy as hell, no ifs, ands or buts about it. By the way, the answer to your question is: The debate isn\u2019t cancelled. It will be a virtual debate and it might not be on the scheduled day but if they reschedule that, that\u2019s known as a postponement - not a cancellation. A virtual debate may be the best possible way for a moderator to get these two to actually follow the rules. That last debate was not a serious debate. It was nothing but show business. Don\u2019t believe me? If the people running the debates were really on the up and up, don\u2019t you think they\u2019d cut off someone\u2019s microphone when they\u2019re interrupting? They blatantly allow the contestants to break the rules time and time again, the contestants don\u2019t even answer the questions they\u2019re asked, yet the people in charge of running the debate administer no penalties whatsoever and you\u2019re taking them seriously? How can you? High school sports take their competitions more seriously! There you get a penalty for breaking the rules and get disqualified if you take things too far and those are just games! Keep a reasonable sense of perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "The left figures they are ahead\u2026no reason to risk by taking chances. They are using the virus as a reason to hold a \u201cvirtual\u2019 debate where Biden can have assistance (teleprompters, ear pieces, coaches) and where each party can have his mic shut off at any time. This prevents one party from asking and demanding answers. Trump won\u2019t accept that\u2026debates are supposed to be symmetrical and the parties should be allowed to go after each other. This format prevents it. A good example would be debate 1\u2026\u2026. When questioning in a debate, a moderator must display some symmetry. If you question Trump on \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d you must also do the same with Antifa and BLM\u2026\u2026..if you bring up the handling of COVID -19 you must also touch on H1N1 during the Obama/Biden years\u2026.if you bring up Trump\u2019s earnings and taxes or Russia/Ukraine/China you must also bring up Biden\u2019s involvement with them relating to the FISA warrant, Hunter, Joe and his brothers $$ from China and Ukraine. So the data shows that Wallace did not do that. \u2026.and a moderator controls both contestants too too too much in a virtual debate\u2026.LESSON LEARNED? ",
