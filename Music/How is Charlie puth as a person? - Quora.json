            "answer_text": "Charlie Puth is an exceptionally talented person. He learnt piano at the age of four. Even though he seems to be a well talented young man, he is typically a shy type person and might be quite hesitant to talk to new people. He was bullied in high school, but he dealt with it in an extraordinary manner. He is quite motivating person and treats everyone equally. In his college days, he used to skip parties and did computer coding!! He is not that social afterall. But he has emerged into something worthy and talented and we have to appreciate it. He is adventurous and he makes friendships with others, he would keep it till the end. He is a really nice person!! ",

Though he's an introvert and lonewolf, he doesn't fear to face his 100 million fans and the entire world with a killer smile on his face. He loves his fans and also respects each person around him. He's really great. Being really very honest, won't lie I've never ever seen him getting mad at someone. I literally don't have words to describe him. He gives space to everyone and to know more bout him you could watch his interviews.  ",
