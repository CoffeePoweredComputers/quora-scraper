            "answer_text": "So I\u2019m gonna explain step by step: Online audition: Basically you audition from their site. You fill all the registration. I recommend you to sing 2 songs that suits your voice really well and just sing english songs if your korean pronounciation is not that good. Then you can send a video of you singing or a video of you dancing. Me personally send 1 audio and 1 video of me singing, so thats 2 song. On this first round, you get 3 emails: First email: saying you have success auditioning or filling the registration. Usually this takes only a few seconds until a few minute. This is an automated email and everyone gets it after sending the audition. Second email: saying that JYP has evaluated or check your audition. This takes about 2 days until 3 weeks after auditioning. For me, I got it 13 days after auditioning (I got it on June 3, now Im waiting for the third email, wish me luck). And not all people receive this one since thousandss of people all around the world audition for JYP each day. Third email: now you have to wait 3\u20134 weeks after the second email. If they send you another email, it means you pass to the private audition. But if you didnt, means you didnt pass. But you can always try again anytime. They open audition everyday. Usually, people say, if they deleted your audition from their site after 7 days (after second email) means you didnt pass, but I dont know if that\u2019s true, but if they didnt delete your audition after 7 days.. means that you pass(but those are only what I heard and that only \u201csigns\u201d)Me personally, its been 7 days after the second email, but all 3 of my auditions are still on their site. Anyways I send 3 auditions to make sure they notice me. And I got 3 evaluation emails too. You can audition 2 times maybe in a different day. but basically just wait for the email. Wish you luck!! ",
