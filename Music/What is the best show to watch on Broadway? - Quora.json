            "answer_text": "i\u2019m not quite sure what to say but i will tell you a few of my favourite shows that are on broadway right now & a bit about them :) waitress - waitress is a MUST SEE. this show will change your life. it was written to perfection by the one and only sara bareilles! it is much a meaningful, deep and funny show which you must see before it closes on january 5th, 2020. beetlejuice - this show is so much fun! (from what i can gather from blasting the obcr and from reviews) it is everything you would want beetlejuice to be and more!! absolutely hilarious and the cast is talented beyond belief! mean girls - taking a classic movie to the stage is always difficult, but mean girls has done it perfectly! this show is amazing and the cast is incredible! it is so so funny & the songs are so good and catchy!!! it is also set in todays time rather than in 2004 which i found very interesting. wicked - a classic musical that is definitely worth the hype! it tells a bold, fantastical story of a young woman named elphaba (you may know her as the wicked witch of the west) who has green skin and has a tough life because of it. incredible (very vocally demanding) music and you leave feeling great! honourable mentions: the prom, be more chill, the cher show, aladdin hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what you\u2019re looking for! And I have bolded my favorite shows in each category! My personal favorites are \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d. If you want to see a \u201cclassic\u201d show, I would recommend shows such as \u201cWicked\u201d, \u201cHello Dolly!\u201d, \u201cCarousel\u201d, \u201cSchool of Rock\u201d, or \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d! If you\u2019re looking for a laugh, there is \u201cGettin\u2019 the Band Back Together\u201d, and \u201cMean Girls\u201d is another fantastic option too. I also haven\u2019t seen \u201cA Bronx Tale\u201d, but I\u2019ve heard incredible things about it as well! If you\u2019re a Carole King fan, definitely see \u201cBeautiful\u201d! If you\u2019re looking for a heart-gripping show, PLEASE GO SEE \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d, \u201cCome From Away\u201d, or \u201cWaitress\u201d. If you have kids or a family with you, see \u201cThe Lion King\u201d, \u201cSpongebob: The Musical\u201d, \u201cAladdin\u201d, or \u201cFrozen: The Musical\u201d. And you could possibly see \u201cAnastasia\u201d with them too. If you\u2019re looking for plays, there is \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d (which is INCREDIBLE) or \u201cThe Play That Goes Wrong\u201d! These are just a few, and there are many other shows out there too! Let me know which one you choose, or if you need any extra detail on certain shows, just ask me! ",
