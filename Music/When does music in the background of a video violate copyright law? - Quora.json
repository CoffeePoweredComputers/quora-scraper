            "answer_text": "When it\u2019s a deliberate use. If it\u2019s incidental it doesn\u2019t violate copyright, but most sites won\u2019t allow it. Example - you cut a wedding show to Handel. Breach (if from a CD). Example - you are filming people doing stunts at a party and the audio picks up the music being played. The background music is thus an incidental inclusion and not a breach. Incidental Inclusion BUT this only applies so long as you had no input into the music selection. Basically it\u2019s the get out for \u201creal life happening in the background, mainly for news and docus\u201d, NOT anything you can use in any kind of planned shoot. However the likes of YT are not at all interested in arguments about Incidental, they\u2019ll just consider it a breach, which they can, as their rules say \u201cmake it yourself or have it cleared\u201d, and they can do this. Their platform, their rules. ",

Hypothetical situation: You\u2019re recording your son or daughters first steps, the radio is on and it\u2019s playing whatever songs the radio plays, and you post that video to YouTube, you just violated copyright law. I know it was innocent, you know it was innocent, but that won\u2019t stop them from at the very least muting the volume and sending out a DMCA take down notice, at the most you could end up in court with some seriously large legal bills. That\u2019s the reality of the situation. ",
