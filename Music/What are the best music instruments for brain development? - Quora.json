            "answer_text": "I play several instruments, some professionally. Here are my thoughts on the few of my favorites: Voice is the easiest to access and hardest to master. But the ultimate instrument in my opinion. Violin comes next - it has huge potential for melody. The hardest part to master is the bow (which takes years and years.) Piano. There is only one note per pitch. Everything is visible and laid out logically. Harmony is possible. The piano can accompany itself. But there is no vibrato or \u2018tone\u2019 control really possible, so ultimately it\u2019s musically limited and is usually relegated to accompanist status. Guitar. Again, this instrument is very accessible at the basic level due to convenient chord shapes. Basic harmony is very accessible, but sophisticated harmony requires incredible LH gymnastics and huge understanding. Guitars tend to make are good melodies (vibrato possible). But the sound decays quickly, so long sweeping phrases aren\u2019t really possible. Accordion. It\u2019s possible to play both a shaped melody and bass/chords. And the bellows allow \u2018shaped\u2019 phrases, like a violin bow. https://vimeo.com/album/3685463 ",

            "answer_text": "Anything with harmony would be best, to get the left and right brain hemispheres communicating. So piano, keyboard, organ all challenge the brain through the hands, which have almost 50% of the nerve endings in your body. Playing keyboard requires you to play harmony, rhythm, melody all at once, a kind of advanced project management on the fly. We were stunned to see some dramatic cognitive advances in even special needs children like Jed (Jed's Moving Story How Music Is Growing His Brain ) and others. Since then we have received dozens of testimonials from other special needs families about how music has opened their children\u2019s minds. Here is a summary of dozens of articles on the impact of music on the brain. (http://bit.ly/MusicBrainOverview ) These results and more have us very interested in further exploring our project and its potential impact on the brain. It is proven to accelerate learning music dramatically, we would like to see if it can accelerate cognitive development as well. (Musical Cognitive Therapy ) For more info on the product side, especially other testimonials, go to Piano Wizard Testimonials or do a search online for Piano Wizard testimonials, or reviews, or videos. Good luck! ",
