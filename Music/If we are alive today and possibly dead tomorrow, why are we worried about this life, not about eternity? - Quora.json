            "answer_text": "Q:\u201dIf we are alive today and possibly dead tomorrow, why are we worried about this life, not about eternity?\u201d There is no need to worry about eternity, because it is highly likely that we will not exist for that long. There is a need to worry about the near future in some contexts, sure, just don\u2019t think too far ahead. The infinite regression of time is logically fallacious and, from the research people have currently conducted, infinite expanses of time can\u2019t really be made possible. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, because I definitely would be curious in formal studies about eternity. When a person dies, the person has, well, perished. They are determined clinically dead by a doctor and are then disposed of in a grave, the ocean, or left to decompose in a place sanctioned for bodily waste. This, however, does not account for what happens to the consciousness of a person. Without having ever had a brain, you weren\u2019t conscious and you weren\u2019t aware of anything\u2014the existence of space around your person, the passage of time, your own emotions, etc. To you, you felt as though none of these exist. Actually, you didn\u2019t feel like anything at all. There was no \u201cyou\u201d yet. For that reason, why would you think that when your brain stops functioning entirely that you\u2019re still aware of the same things? Eternity is a strange concept to discuss when also talking about the human consciousness. We aren\u2019t dependent upon consciousness to be alive, I don\u2019t think, but without awareness, we would just act according to instinct and with little to no freethought. We would be more similar to the other species in the taxonomic kingdom Animalia; we would do only what allowed us to survive and to survive more easily. It is unknown whether there are other advanced consciousnesses developed in animals and other organisms on Earth because they are mostly incapable of answering questions without being given a limited number of choices. When a question is open-ended, such as how you would spend a life that goes on forever and ever, there are barely any realistic answers that would provide us with permanent contentedness. I fear the thought of being aware for an entire eternity. That would be too long and too painful to deal with. Eventually, I would have tried everything in my power that I wanted (or will want) to do and nothing would be enjoyable anymore. That is why mortality gives a life meaning! Be grateful that there is no evidence in support of an afterlife or afterlives, permanent awareness with permanently-lasting memory. Be grateful that all of us are going to die eventually. ",

            "answer_text": "If we are alive today and possibly dead tomorrow, why are we worried about this life, not about eternity? Death is not the end of it Death is the end of the temporary testing stage We are here for testing; test environment necessitates struggle between desires and obedience, between good and evil. Testing missions are not supposed to be fair, easy, or comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. The wealthy father has the right to test his sons before distributing the wealth The wise father disciplines his children and prepares them for a better life The obedient son who takes care of others should be rewarded better than the disobedient son who persecutes others. Psalm 66:10 teaches \u2018For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us as silver is refined\u2019 Proverbs 17:3 teaches \u2018The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, but God tests the hearts\u2019 Isaiah 48:10 teaches \u2018I have refined you, but not as silver is refined. Rather, I have refined you in the furnace of suffering\u2019 Job 23:10 teaches \u2018when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold\u2019 Qur\u2019an verse 47:31 clarifies that we are here for testing And We will surely test you until We make evident those who strive among you [for the cause of God] and the patient, and We will test your affairs Verse 29:2-3 confirms that we are here for testing Do the people think that they will be left to say, \"We believe\" and they will not be tried? But We have certainly tried those before them, and God will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars. Similar teachings are found in 67:2, 18:7, 2:155 and 76:2 Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives; we cannot have inner peace without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day... for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-our-purpose-of-existence-in-this-world/answer/Sabri-Shahin We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed The student is not supposed to rejoice and enjoy himself during the exam hours Students should not wonder about the intention of the teacher; they are supposed to focus on what the teacher asked them to do If God wants to set up the testing environment to test people, then we are not supposed to advise God on how to set up the terms and conditions of the testing. The students are not supposed to advise the teacher on how to prepare the exams. God has created us, and he knows how to test us. The testing questions and answers are not supposed to be disclosed before the exam; testing environment necessitates some doubts and enables different choices and different decisions. The test does not depend on the level of education, a child may say \u2018I do not see the plane any more, it is going far away, it is still there but my sight does not reach it; God must be there but my sight does not reach him\u2019, but a scientist might conclude that, \u2018I do not see God, then there is no God\u2019. The test does not depend on the level of religion education, maybe someone who never heard of the religion teachings could pass the test based on the natural original gifts of conscience and reason \u2018What I do not want done to myself, I will not do to others. We may find some scholars who know the religion teachings but they accept to persecute and torture others, those are the bad trees which the prophets have warned us of them and of their bad fruits. The wise teacher sets different evaluation criteria for different grades; the students in the first grade are not evaluated as the students in the advanced degrees. We expect that the fair and wise God would evaluate people according to what they have been provided. The person who never heard of Prophets would have an easier test based on the gift of intelligence and conscience; he might get rewards for his good works and he might not be punished if not wicked. God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God does not predetermine bad plans for good people. God does not predetermine good plans for disobedient people. We see many people born poor but have succeeded in life We see many people born rich but failed in life God has empowered us to do and get whatever we want. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. For those who have doubts, they can ask God. All prophets have urged us to ask God and taught that God would answer us. Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us.
