            "answer_text": "All 7 flats make up the key signature C flat Major or a flat minor. This is because when the sequence of whole and half steps making up the major scale (WWHWWWH) is played starting on C flat, it results in the playing of a flatted note for each tone in the scale. When C flat is played from the aeolian mode (also knows as the relative minor) it forms a flat minor which is effectively the same scale starting on the sixth scale tone. ",
