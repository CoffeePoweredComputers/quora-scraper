            "answer_text": "This is not universally true. Some specific translations, however, do have a copyright in place. The most notable example would be the New International Version. For that edition, the terms of fair use are reasonably generous, allowing literally hundreds of verses at a time to be freely quoted or copied without prior approval. Still, why a copyright on the Word of God? It takes time and effort over the course of years to translate the Bible from one language to the other, and this effort needs to be remunerated in order to compensate the translation teams, cover their overhead, and to fund projects leading to the further dissemination of the translation for little to no cost in support of missionary work and general evangelism. Case in point: Some years back my old church provided extensive financial support for a project to translate the Bible into the spoken-only language of an indigenous people group from Guatemala called the Rabinal Achi. This took a very long time, and involved an extensive amount of work on the part of linguists, pastors, and bible scholars to make it happen, as well as providing non-textual methods such as durable solar-powered digital playback devices or low-cost MP3 players by which to distribute the work to the Achi. The Achi have never been charged so much as a single quetzal for this translation. For that matter, no one else has either. You can even download it off of iTunes for free, so enjoy (assuming you speak the Achi language). While the translation work itself is copyrighted, this is mainly done to protect the recognition of the people who worked to make this happen. Additionally, there are any number of study bibles published wherein the copyright is not necessarily applicable to the Bible\u2019s text, but instead to the notes and commentaries supplied by the author or authors. If any this still seems bothersome, then there is nothing mandating you rely on any one translation. There are a still any number of translations such as the American Standard Version, or the King James Version of the Bible, wholly in the public domain and freely distributed. Bibles on Bible Gateway that are in the public domain Christians, incidentally, aren\u2019t the only ones who copyright religious works. ",

            "answer_text": "Apart from everything else, the Bible is still a book. That means it requires a publisher - a company willing to spend money to produce a new translation[1]. Translation is an incredibly time-consuming and expensive process, relying on Bible scholars, language specialists, copy-editors and proofreaders, etc. There are usually whole teams of people responsible for certain chapters. All of these people have to be paid. Even if the publisher uses an existing translation and only updates the rest, that still means professional typesetting, layout, book design, cover design, printing, binding, packaging, distribution, marketing and warehousing. The fact that there is a huge audience (at least in some languages), many of whom can afford to buy such a book, doesn't make any of these activities any cheaper - it just means the publisher is more likely to recover its costs. Considering that copyright is what gives the content creators (i.e. all these creative people who have put in thousands of hours of effort) the right to charge for their own work, it really is no surprise that different Bible translations are protected by this right. It's the same law that allows artists, photographers and authors to earn a living from their work - regardless of how popular they become. There are translations available under different licenses, where the copyright has expired, or which are otherwise in the Public Domain[2]- but this typically does not include accessible editions of the original texts (even if you could read them). The bottom line is: making the information accessible in ways that people want it (modern language, modern layout, modern typefaces, modern covers...) always takes effort, and in the modern era, that effort has become protected by law. It wasn't always this way. Before our modern copyright laws, the ideas of \"authorship\" and \"originality\" didn't necessarily have attribution (and therefore compensation) in mind. Which is why you should be sceptical if someone tells you this or that part of the Bible had been \"plagiarised\" - the ideal of originality was only invented in the 18th century.
