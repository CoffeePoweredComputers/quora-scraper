            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a good question. Off the top of my head the only ones I can think of are Vernon Reid, Corey Glover, Will Calhoun and Doug Wimbish; collectively known as Living Colour. They\u2019re more Funk Rock than Progressive Rock, but if you\u2019ve ever really listened to their stuff it can get pretty complex at times. Odd time signatures and arpeggios and whatnot. So I\u2019d throw them on the list. Doug Pinnick from King\u2019s X fits the bill. Stanley Clarke and Lenny White possibly. Though they\u2019re a bit more Jazz Fusion than overall Progressive Rock. There\u2019s P. P. Arnold. She\u2019s more of a soul singer but she has recorded and performed with Pink Floyd, George Harrison, Steve Howe and Peter Gabriel; who all fall into the Prog Rock category at times. She was in The Nice with Keith Emerson; who\u2019s one of the founding fathers of Prog Rock. Narada Michael Walden is a bit more Funk and Soul, but he\u2019s been known to get a bit Progressive at times; especially in his stint with Mahavishnu Orchestra. There\u2019s Andre Carswell and Raoul Walton of Anyone\u2019s Daughter; currently and previously: respectively. Johanne James of Threshold. They\u2019re Pregressive Metal. That counts. That\u2019s all i can muster at the moment.  Edit: Tosin Abasi. He founded Animals As Leaders; which is one of the dominant instrumental Progressive bands around. (Thanks to Ed Seith and Rick Carnahan for the comments.) Stevie Wonder. His stuff most definitely pushed the boundaries of the average funk and soul music of his day. I might consider him more Progressive Jazz/Funk than Rock; but the prog spirit is there so he\u2019s on the list. (Thanks to Jeff Hillstead for the comment.) ",

Also, if Elvis can be considered Rock & Roll, these guys can fall into the alternate category as well: Temtpations Sam Cooke Chuck Berry Ray Charles If you mean currently, I\u2019m kind of stuck in the past and would say: Lenny Kravitz\u2026but this is kind of old school. As far as new guys\u2026..I have NO idea!!! ",
