            "answer_text": "A2A Question: What do people see in Ellen DeGeneres? Is there some reason she is famous that I'm missing? Some thoughts: She\u2019s funny, without being threatening - Ellen\u2019s humor is the bland and largely inoffensive kind that attracts the middle class viewers her program is seeking. She isn\u2019t \u201cdirty\u201d and, as a female comedian, her humor doesn\u2019t \u201cmale bash\u201d which doesn\u2019t make her a threat some people\u2019s fragile egos.She\u2019s gay, but not \u201cmilitantly so.\u201d - Everybody knows that Ellen DeGeneres is gay\u2026but her public image is carefully crafted to keep that as just another part of her personality. Her wife doesn\u2019t appear very often on the program, she doesn\u2019t use her talk show as a platform for LGBTQ issues, she avoids \u201cmilitantly gay\u201d guests and she keeps things as \u201cstraight\u201d as she possibly can. Only true homophobes could find anything about her program which promotes being gay. In fact, if she had a Steadman Graham in the background, you wouldn\u2019t know that she was a lesbian.Her timing was excellent - Hollywood kept trying to create a \u201cWhite Oprah Winfrey\u201d to compete with the real one. The only one who made the \u201ccut\u201d was DeGeneres. She was the right person, at the right time, with the right blend of blandness and humor to make her appealing to mass audiences. A few years earlier or later, she wouldn\u2019t have made it. Her timing was just right and a lot of people find that to be appealing.Her personal life is pretty undercover - Again, her wife doesn\u2019t appear on the show very often. Her relationship with her mother has to be pretty strained (DeGeneres by her own admission had a hard time coming out to her which doesn\u2019t indicate much closeness) and she doesn\u2019t have any children, neither of which are spoken about on the show. While her real estate speculation makes news, her personal affairs rarely do. The public can certainly appreciate a celebrity who keeps their private matters private and Ms. DeGeneres certainly does do that.She keeps her harder edges well-hidden - If you watch DeGeneres\u2019 early standup (and read a recent interview about her) it\u2019s pretty clear that she isn\u2019t all \u201csweetness and light.\u201d The fact that she\u2019s managed to keep people from going back too far into her past and pulling out the unpleasant things (or getting her to be too unpleasant now) is a testament to both her self-control and her image-managing abilities. While there are occasionally cracks in the facade (Watch how Ellen acts on her shopping trips and how she acts when things are going a little rough with a guest) for the most part, Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 rough parts are kept well-hidden.Soooo\u2026while I don\u2019t know why YOU don\u2019t like her, questioner, I can tell you that her mild humor, bland inoffensiveness, her timing and her ability to keep her personal life and demons under wraps are the major reasons that she\u2019s been a success.

            "answer_text": "Is she funny? Yeah, but she\u2019s not THAT funny. Here\u2019s my personal thoughts on Ellen DeGeneres. I like her. I liked her show that she was on called \u201cEllen\u201d where she was a book store owner. It was okay and an easy way to kill 30 minutes. I didn\u2019t watch it religiously or anything, but if I wasn\u2019t doing anything and it was on, sure I\u2019d watch it. Then she came out as Gay on the show and in real life. And she paid for it. She thought she had ruined her career and she did for a while. But here\u2019s my take on this and I could be completely wrong on this, but it was my observation and I\u2019ve not heard many people say this. I didn\u2019t care about Ellen coming out as gay and I didn\u2019t care that the character on the show was gay. But after that happened, that\u2019s what the show became about. ELLEN is GAY. That could have been the episode title of every weekly airing. It got old. Okay okay, we get it. Now go back to your weekly episodic sitcom stuff and make a funny (or semi-funny) 30 minute show about something other than the fact that Ellen is gay. Would the show have continued if they had carried on as before? I don\u2019t know. People blame the failure of that sitcom on her coming out. I say NAY NAY. I feel it failed because her coming out as gay became the sole subject matter of the show. She just recently had a standup show that I watched on Netflix. Wanna guess what the whole premise of the show was? Ellen was gay and came out in the 90\u2019s. I was kind of disappointed, because I was really looking forward to enjoying her show. And I did enjoy it actually, but it could have been so much better. Now I can\u2019t say much about her daytime talk show. It\u2019s obviously very successful given the number of years it\u2019s been on. I\u2019ve seen snippets of it on YouTube or if I\u2019ve got a day off and I happen to see a piece of it. She played a couple of parts in some movies (Ed and Mr. Wrong come to mind) and obviously Dory in Finding Nemo. Here\u2019s the thing, and once again, this is just me. I\u2019m not a Hollywood junkie, character expert. She just comes across as a very naturally nice person. She comes across as a person that you just want to be friends with and be nice to. She comes across as a fun person and we don\u2019t have to agree with everything, but lets have fun around the things we DO agree with. She comes across as a person that could be friends with ANYONE. And when the vast majority of people in Hollywood absolutely do NOT come off that way, she is a breath of fresh air. I believe THAT\u2019s what people see in Ellen DeGeneres. She\u2019s not the funniest, she\u2019s not the most beautiful, she\u2019s not the most youthful, but she\u2019s got an infectious attitude and an infectious smile. ",
