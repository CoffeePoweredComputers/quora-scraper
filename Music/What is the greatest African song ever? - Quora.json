            "answer_text": "Perhaps not a contender for the greatest African song ever but I find these three songs very enjoyable. 1. Aqal Wada Dhisno by Amina Xasan & Anwar Tutti It also set in Somalia, complete with traditional Somali clothing and folk dance.  2. Diriyam oo hoo Diriyam by Khadijo Qalanjo This was recorded in the \u201880s, when recording devices in Somalia did not provide the clearest picture and sound, but it remains a favourite of mine.  3. Baaq Abwaan by Aar Maanta Here is a stripped down song. Just a man and his kaban, a traditional Somali instrument similar to the lude. These kinds of songs are probably one of my favourite Somali genres.  ",

            "answer_text": "Although I have no problem of being African, I am more familiar with North Africa, so I nominate this:  Now, you guys may need to learn that, this is also an African song, as the song is from Khaled, an Algerian singer. What I found impressive of it is because it\u2019s very lovely and lively, full of strength and fun from the part. It highlights the kind of closeness and deep cultural tie, with the dance of Amazigh, African, Arabic and European styles. So what do you think? It\u2019s just my opinion, but I must say this is the best African song. Although there are some important African songs later, I feel it has not replaced \u201cDidi\u201d. Full version there:  ",
