            "answer_text": "If you write, then Ableton Live. If you write & perform, then definitely Ableton Live. I've been using Ableton Live since version 4, and currently use 9.x (preordered 10). I've also used Logic heavily in the past. I really liked Logic 8 & 9, but then moved fully back to Live. Logic is amazing for writing and scoring to video or film, but I missed the simplicity of the Ableton interface and the spontaneity that Ableton harbors to help create happy accidents and spark creativity when you're not feeling it. I wanted to concentrate on one tool, know it inside and out, so I can more easily get the sounds I hear in my head out into the world. There are a few things that Live does very well that I haven't seen in other DAW I've worked with. 1.) Session View I love being able to organize music idea into loops. Live has both a session view, arranged like a mixer with stacks of loops on top, and a timeline view (Arrangement View). You can launch these sections of loops to quantize to the beat, bar, or really any subdivision of time. This is huge if you are feeling stuck and don't know how to arrange the sections yo've come up with thus far. Change the quantization to 8th notes and hit record. Then mix up up your sections and have them play unexpectedly. If you want to introduce more randomness, you can set clips on the same track to alternate at various times, or stop completely after a number of loops. 2.) Flat, Beautiful Interface  I'm not a fan of all the different visual presentation and GUI that comes with most DAWs and plugins. I find it distracting and cumbersome honestly. I just want attributes and easy way to control them. Having a compressor look vintage is not going to improve the sound quality or your creativity. Less is always more. The uniformity across the audio effects, instruments, and midi controls create a familiar environment that makes it easier to create with the built in tools. I don't use any plugins because the built in instruments and effects are incredible (except for Pianoteq once in a while, because it's best piano sound I've ever heard emulated and takes up almost no CPU). The more you learn about how the tools work, the more in translates across the whole DAW. And you can change the color scheme really easily. It's kind of like the Apple of DAWs. I will note that Logic X UI has improved greatly also. Much smoother. 3.) Proprietary Warping & Time Stretching The various modes in Ableton for warping audio and loops are both utilitarian and an instrument in their own right. Beat-based warping creates staggering glitchy rhythms you wouldn't have made without. Textural warping introduces grain-base time stretching for creating huge and dynamic atmospheric sounds. Use Tone based warping for fixing timing without losing the tonal quality of the sound, excellent for clearly pitched instruments or vocals. There's a ton of capability here. 4.) World Class Instruments & Synths Ableton has some incredible instruments, many of them created with AAS, the world leader in acoustics and sound modeling. Take Tension for example. It's string based modeling instrument that allows you create sounds that very accurately emulate real-life instruments, or create hybrid sounds that could be physical but you would have no way to make in reality (yet). Collision, Sampler, Operator (best FM synthesizer I've used), Analog, not too mention sample libraries galore, layer-able instrument racks and drum racks... really some of the best synths and emulators I've laid my hands on. So, I might be a bit biased. This is just my humble experience and I am no one of note. Please take it with a grain of salt. Get some demos. Play around with you have access to, and if you like it, learn it inside and out. Then concentrate more on creating beautiful things and less on beautiful tools. ",

            "answer_text": "More to offer to who?  A common misconception is that tools for creating art are like gadgets with features. The more features it has, the more their values are. In reality, tools for creating art are essentially just tools. We all know that selecting the right tools gets the job done better and faster. DAW software packages are tools for creating music. They help you do similar things, but they do so differently. When selecting tools, you first make clear of what you want to make, and how you want to make it. Then select the tools that help you make it while simplifying the process of making it. For example, you make tunes by recording 2 guitars, 1 bass and a drum set. Logic or even Garageband are probably best for their new simplified interface  geared towards this kind of work (see their sample project files). But if you prefer creating a few patterns and experimenting with them, Ableton Live is a better than Garageband by design. Note that the two types of the above sample projects can both be done with either software. But how the tools are designed to make it easy for each style is different. ",
