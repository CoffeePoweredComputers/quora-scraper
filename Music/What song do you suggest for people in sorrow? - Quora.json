            "answer_text": "Only one: Sapnon Se Bhare Naina from the movie Luck By Chance. This song is sung by Shankar Mahadevan and trust me his truly magical voice, the lyrics, their meaning, the music, the tempo, the Indian Classical touch, the context in which the song is taken\u2026\u2026..it perfectly describes the state of mind of a person in sorrow and as the song proceeds you feel truly relieved. This song doesn't provide any solutions in general for any problems but rather describes the situation which I am sure perfectly matches with most of the problems. So here are the lyrics: Bagiya bagiya baalak bhaage, titali phir bhi haath na laage the child chases around in many a garden, but the butterfly refuses to be caught iss pagale ko kaun bataaye, dhund raha hai jo tu jag mein who is going to tell this mad man, that which you seek in this world koi jo paaye toh mann mein hi paaye if one is to ever find it, it will only be found in oneself sapano se bhare naina, tu nind hai na chaina - (2) these eyes filled with dreams, it gives neither rest nor peace aisee dagar koi agar to apnaaye, har raah ke o ant pe rasta hi paaye when one travels a path, at the end of it he will find another path dhup ka rasta jo pair jalaaye, mod toh aaye chaanv na aaye the heat of the road will burn your feet, there will be turns on the road but hardly some shade raahi jo chalata hai, chalata hi jaaye the traveler will forever journey koi nahi hai jo kahi use samjhaaye and there is nobody anywhere who could convince him (that he has reached a final destination) sapano se bhare naina, tu nind hai na chaina - (2) these eyes filled with dreams, it gives neither rest nor peace naina re naina re naina re.... naina aa aa re (these eyes ... these eyes ...) dur hi se saagar jise har koi maane, paani hai woh ya ret hai ye kaun jaane he who believe he sees a sea from a distance, is it really water or a mirage over sand jaise ke din se rain alag hai, sukh hai alag aur chain alag hai like the night is independent of the day, happiness and peace are independent par jo yeh dekhe woh nain alag hai, chain toh hai apana sukh hai paraaye he who sees this will have a vision of his own, peace is ours and happiness somebody else's sapano se bhare naina, tu nind hai na chaina - (2) naina re naina re naina re.... naina aa aa re I have also attached its YouTube link.

            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends on the kind of sorrow and what you hope to gain from listening to music. Sometimes a big emotional song to help trigger the water works and \u2018let it all out\u2019 is what people need. Ya\u2019ll should know this one, an apt choice for the brief: - Coldplay - Fix You  But on the other hand, you might want something a little more upbeat to help forget your sorrows for a moment. Now I\u2019m a certified slave to the funk, so usually I\u2019d whack on some Zapp & Roger or some old school Prince or something (RIP Purple One). But let\u2019s keep this current and accessible\u2026 I love the new Bruno Mars album\u2026 I think it\u2019s excellent. This sort of stuff should turn any frown upside down: - Bruno Mars - 24K Magic  Neither of these are for everybody. Sometimes sorrow can lead to anger, and that might make you want to hear something angry; angry music massively helps a lot of people get through tough times, it can be a powerful tool. Beware of your anger leading to hate\u2026 we all know where that leads. I\u2019m a sucker for Rage, this banger gets me going whenever I need the juices flowing: - Rage Against the Machine - Wake Up  ",
