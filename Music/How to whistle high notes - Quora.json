            "answer_text": "Well the trick lies in contracting your throat. I can\u2019t really describe it, but it is a matter of practice. If you can hit those notes- but you sound breathy, it means that your throat muscles have what it takes to create that high pitch voice, but at the moment they\u2019re not strong enough to not let air pass. If you practice enough, these muscles will fortify and that breathy sound will go away. Of course \u2014 You shouldn\u2019t put too much strain on your throat. Practice only for a couple minutes a day. Source- Avid whistler, can hit high notes consistently. ",

            "answer_text": "Its all about practice. Anybody can use whistle register, its a matter of practice as to whether or not they can use it correctly and healthily, however. If you are a male, your whistle notes will start to appear around that A5 - C6 range. If you are a female, then it will probably start around a D6 or an E6. If your asking HOW to find your whistle register, I suggest you be careful. There are a lot of videos on the internet saying things like \u201cHow to sing whistle notes with these 3 easy steps\u201d. While the idea OF whistle register in of itself is simple, it differs from person to person, and takes a lot of practice to be able to use whistle register well. If you want to use whistle register as more of a party gimmick, I suggest you find a vocal coach that can help you find and use your whistle register. ",
