            "answer_text": "Winehouse, like her contemporaries in the \u201c27 Club,\u201d was unable to establish stability in her life. The fame and money exacerbated her negative impulses. Only when she was working on a music project did she discipline herself. Many elements came together to create this music savant. Unfortunately, these same elements lead her down the road of alcohol poisoning. Just like Cobain and his shotgun, Brian Jones and his pool, and Robert Johnson and a jealous husband. She may have saved herself it, but it would\u2019ve taken a superhuman effort. ",
