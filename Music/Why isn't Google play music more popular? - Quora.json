            "answer_text": "Why isn't Google play music more popular? It is not that it's bad, in fact, it's very good and for the industry, the price is comfortably average so why then is it rarely talked about? While Apple has locked their device down pretty well android is not really tethered to google and so users can very easily use other services to supply music to their devices. Spotify is free if you can stand the adds as is Pandora. Amazon music is free with a paid subscription to prime and it offers a lot of value for the price also any new music purchases on Amazon are instantly added to your Amazon music selection on any device that can use Amazon music. So those are the hurdles that Google Play Music faces and the reasons why it may not be as popular as other possibilities out there. ",
