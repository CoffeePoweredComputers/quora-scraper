            "answer_text": "Sound is what's known as a compression (or longitudinal) wave. It propagates through the air (in this case) as a series of compressions and rarefactions, with their spacings dependent on frequency and strength dependent on 'volume'. A good way to visualize this is if you are sat in the bath, if you put your hand in the water, fingers outstretched and together, and move it quickly away from you down the bath you will see that a wave appears. This is exactly how a loudspeaker generates sound. The loudspeaker is connected, electrically, to a sound source. This sound source sends the sound as an electrical signal down a wire (actually a pair of wires) to the loudspeaker. At the loudspeaker the wires are connected to a ring-shaped electromagnet so that the electric signal in the wires is converted (or transduced) to a changing magnetic field in the circular ring electromagnet. Sitting inside the ring is a (normally cylindrical) permanent magnet which is physically connected (by glue!) to a paper cone that is fixed, at its edge to the speaker frame or cabinet.  The changing magnetic field in the electromagnet causes the permanent magnet (and therefore the paper cone) to move backwards and forward, with a frequency equal to the signal frequency and a distance proportional to the signal strength. This creates a wave in the air, in the same way that your hand created one in the bath water.In practice the design of loudspeakers is an art whereby the designer uses skill and experience to select materials with different stiffnesses and magnets of different strengths to obtain maximum performance from the speaker. Considerations like whether the cone is mounted in a sealed box or one with a hole (port) make a big difference to the speaker's sound, as does the size (and, therefore, resonant frequency) of the speaker. One such optimisation in modern speakers is to actually make the electromagnet the moving piece attached to the speaker and have the permanent magnets fixed. This is done because the electromagnet can be much smaller - and therefore lighter - than the permanent magnet, meaning that the speaker cone has to move less mass as it goes backwards and forwards making it more efficient.  You will notice that any decent speaker cabinet contains a number of speakers, of varying sizes (tweeters, woofers and mid-range for example) these are tuned to varying frequencies and use components known as 'crossovers' to send the relevant frequencies to the best speakers, but that's a whole other answer...

            "answer_text": "When current flows through a coil, it creates a magnetic field. If this coil is placed in an existing magnetic field, it will be either pushed or pulled, depending on the relative directions of the existing magnetic field and that created by the current in the coil. So in a speaker, a coil of enamel insulated wire is wound around a thin tube. This tube is placed around a permanent magnet, and held in place by a flexible membrane called a \"spider\". This allows the coil to move in and out, but not move side to side. A larger cone made of something stiff like paper or plastic or even carbon fiber is attached to the coil. This gives the coil a way to move a lot of air when it moves.       The magnet has more steel placed around it to restrict the field so it is only going through where the coil is located.    An electrical duplicate of the pressure waves that make up a sound are applied to the coil windings. As the current flows in one direction, the coil moves out and the cone creates the compression part of the sound. As the current flows in the other direction, the coil moves in and the cone creates the rarefaction part of the sound.    You can even build a crude speaker yourself, although you may be putting your amplifier at risk with such a crude device. A paper plate, some very fine enameled wire (aka \"magnet wire\") of around 28 gauge or smaller, a very strong magnet, and a paper tube that fits over the magnet will do. Phys 420 - Paper Speakers Here is a Youtube video showing the same thing. They also take a speaker apart.    Ignore all the ones that claim you can do it with a penny and aluminum foil. ",
