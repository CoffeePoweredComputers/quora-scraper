            "answer_text": "Unmixed tracks are referred to the tracks that we obtain when we record something. All the volume faders are at unity (or same level). The volumes of the tracks are not adjusted properly and hence the track doesn't sound systematic. A mixed track whereas, has all the volume levels properly adjusted according to the genre of the music, in addition to this, the processing is also done in the audio. Hence the audio sounds complete and is ready to master! I'm myself an audio engineer and a music producer. If you have any doubts related to mixing, you can ping me! Good luck. ",

Also to fatten up or flatten certain elements.Application techniques like side chain or NYC compression to bring out the essence of the trackApplication of effects such as reverb / delay / chorus / glitch / filters depending on genre.Vocals tightened up at consonants or layers.This track is now ready to be mastered or normalised Happy mixing!!
