            "answer_text": "I always find it amusing when people talk about Kate as if she suddenly went strange. Her songs include: an interpretation of a literary ghost (actually at least three - Wuthering Heights and the Turn of the Screw in Infant Kiss, and The Shining in Get Out of my House)a story of the military experiment to kill people with sounda narrative from an unborn baby about nuclear wara concept piece about a drowning womanwhat Elvis would think if he was alive living on a mountain in secreta song about a serial killer using poison in coffeeWhat sex would be like if the partners swapped bodiesa bride who kills her husband\u2019s murderera woman who dreams about being a kitea woman who dreams about being a fireworka woman who has sex with a snowmana woman who haunts herselfKate has always been a little odd. Since the late 80\u2019s the time between albums became longer as she became more reclusive and more precious about what she releases. She periodically puts out work. Fairly recently she released a book of lyrics, but her last studio album was almost 10 years ago. I would certainly expect more from her, but she is an artist whose fans don\u2019t expect regular releases and whose finances mean she isn\u2019t likely to release anything substandard because she needs the money. Of course what we\u2019ll get and when is completely unknown. She is very secretive about her work, so it\u2019s as likely to become an orchestral piece based around bagpipe music unexpectedly released tomorrow, as it is a selection of Irish jigs featuring Stormzy in 10 years time. In the meantime her back catalogue stands repeated listening. ",
