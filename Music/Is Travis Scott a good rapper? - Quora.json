            "answer_text": "Travis Scott is one of the most fascinating rappers today. I cannot think of another rapper this decade besides Kanye West who has had such a presence in not just music, but the public consciousness. All three of his studio albums have gone platinum, he is currently married to the youngest \u201cself-made\u201d billionaire in the world, and is currently a seal of quality and success for any song he features on. On top of this, his most recent album Astroworld was so successful and generated so much hype that Scott collaborated with the Jordan Brand to release an Air Jordan 1 Retro High that sold out in less than 5 minutes, collaborated with Reese\u2019s Puffs to create a cereal box, and collaborated with Virgil Abloh to create some Off-White concert merchandise. And on the topic of concert merchandise, his hats and shirts are now routinely selling on secondary sites for hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars. So yeah, with the all the massive hype this guy generates, the question must be asked: Is Travis Scott a good rapper? In my opinion, Travis Scott is one of the best rappers working today, but to a point. Travis is very good within the requirements he has set for himself, but if he strays outside these requirements, he tends to struggle, and I believe these requirements are as such: He must have incredible productionHe must sound like he gives a shitHe must make songs that give him room to express himselfHe must feature artists that aid him rather than usurp himIf he has all of these, then his music is, well, pretty fantastic. But when he doesn\u2019t his music can really suffer. Take \u201cPiss On Your Grave\u201d, one of my least favorite songs by Scott. The production on the song sucks, Kanye West puts out an incredibly poor feature, and Travis sounds like he\u2019s stumbling all throughout the track because it is so different from everything he does that it was clear that his mentor wanted to do the song more than he did. There are also times when Scott can show a clear lack of effort, such as on \u201cCOFFEE BEAN\u201d, where Scott just sounds like he does not give a fuck about what he\u2019s singing about. So yeah, I\u2019ve gotten my negatives out of the way for Travis Scott, but how about his positives? Well, I think Scott has an incredible ear for beats, and nearly always features his own unique sounding tracks, ranging from the psychedelic and haunting \u201cSTOP TRYING TO BE GOD\u201d to the grooving \u201cApple Pie\u201d to the energized and electric \u201cNO BYSTANDERS\u201d. Not only does Scott have an incredible range, but he also is able to match is persona with his beats, always keeping up with his production so as to make sure he is never overpowered and shows time and time again how much of a consummate performer he really is. Scott also knows how to get the right features for his songs, who often pull out incredible verses, such as Justin Bieber on \u201cMaria, I\u2019m Drunk\u201d and Kendrick Lamar on \u201cgoosebumps.\u201d So overall, is Travis Scott a good rapper? Not only is Scott good, he\u2019s great. However, he does have very clear flaws that, if gone unchecked, can lead to some rather poor tracks. However, there is no denying the star power in this guy.

            "answer_text": "I have very strong opinions about this, but I strongly and ardently believe that Travis Scott is not just a good, but one of the best performing artists right now. Hear me out: Many rap purists object to Travis Scott and his style of music for one reason: they believe that the most important thing about rap music are the lyrics. While I respect this decision, I think it\u2019s completely wrong and ignores the complexity and context surrounding lyrics. If you\u2019ve ever happened about Travis Scott or his music, the first thing that will stick out to you is his beats and production. Goosebumps[1] is arguably the hardest and most hype song I\u2019ve ever listened to. Antidote[2] went triple platinum, but before it became that Travis took a bet on the sample and hedged 50% of his record label on it .[3] All of Rodeo and Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight are filled with spacey and moody bangers that put the production in front of lyrics or bars. This has been the defining feature of Travis Scott and all of his music - ridiculous beats that aren't meant to provoke introspection or call out social issues, but serve as an embodiment of in-the-moment entertainment. If you expect rap music to be means to an end - to teach larger social issues or make social commentary - then you probably won\u2019t enjoy Travis Scott. But if you treat the music as the end itself you can\u2019t help but enjoy Travis\u2019s music. It\u2019s why every Travis concert presents scenes like this or this - and after watching these scenes it\u2019s hard to deny that Travis Scott is not only one of the best performers but a fantastic rapper and artist.
