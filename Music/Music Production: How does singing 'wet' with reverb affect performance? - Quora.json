            "answer_text": "Negatively. There is a 99.9999% chance your pitch will be off and you will sing worse. Why do you think people like to sing in the bathroom? All the extra reverb makes their vocal sound better than it is. You should learn to sing dry with no reverb. Some singers might be more confident with reverb. Kinda like how people are more confident if they perform when high or drunk. Just because they\u2019re more confident doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to perform better lol. Similarly to being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, hearing yourself sound better than you are is not a good idea. It will just create more issues later in comping and vocal tuning. The secret is to become more confident while hearing yourself back as accurately as possible, that means dry. You can experiment with having one ear off on the headphones if you struggle with hearing yourself back dry. A lot of professional singers do this. This information is based of recording singers professionally, full-time for 18 years. Any singer who asks to sing with reverb on sings worse. I\u2019ve never had anyone sing better with reverb and I\u2019ve recorded thousands of singers. You\u2019ll find amateur singers and rappers ask to sing with reverb or even with Auto Tune which is even a worse idea than singing with reverb. Professional singers always sing dry, with the exception of singers in Japan and certain parts of Asia that like to have reverb even if it makes them sing more out of tune, the mix engineer will tune them harder. If you\u2019re recording yourself and want a mixing tip on monitoring with reverb, create a track in your DAW, create a pre-fader send to an aux track with a reverb plugin set to 100 percent wet, drop the gain on the fader to 0db. Now you can monitor if your interface with no latency while you have a reverb track in the DAW. The short delay/latency from when the reverb starts won\u2019t be noticeable. If you monitor your vocal from your interface mixer, it will have no latency as opposed to doing it in your DAW. I always advise to record without reverb but some vocalists insist on it despite my warning that they will sing worse. For them, I do the routing mentioned above.

            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you're only asking about differences that occur in the recording while monitoring wet, and monitoring dry. That is, the reverb is applied for monitoring purposes only, not recorded into the track.   If so, the differences are subtle, but there. If you're monitoring with headphones that isolate sound very well, then you'll hear very little of the sounds around you, including the sound of your voice bouncing off of the walls of the room - something that you hear every time you sing, making it seem natural to you. If you're monitoring dry, what you'll effectively hear is this: (the sound conducted by your bones to your ear) + (what's recorded being played back to you) Now, if you're recording in a regular room at home, then the reverb from the room will be recorded into the track, so when it is played back to you, it satisfies your brain's expectation of room acoustics and you won't give it a second thought.But if you were to record in an expensive room that looked like this:   Then you'll find that monitoring what you're recording dry doesn't seem to help a lot.This is when it'll make a huge difference to add some reverb to the monitoring mix. It'll be a breath of fresh air after hearing the sterile, unnatural voice you've been hearing for a while. TL;DR: Monitoring wet will only make a huge difference if you have an accoustically isolated room. Otherwise, you'll most likely be satisfied with a dry monitoring mix. ",
