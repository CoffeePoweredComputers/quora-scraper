            "answer_text": "Everyone has different levels of fear and processes fear differently. Some are much more sensitive to various phenomena than others. You apparently are very sensitive to sound in this way. I don\u2019t have the answer as to \u201cwhy.\u201d But, you to have the, \u201cwhat,\u201d and that is something you can work with. You can get some hearing protectors like are used when mowing the lawn to quiet things down, and those foam ear plugs can help. I used them all the time when studying and sleeping in college. Then there\u2019s other components that might be worked on like what you think about when you have the reaction. You can think about that and over time choose other possible reactions and train yourself. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s often not easy to change to a place where you\u2019d rather be. Good luck.

            "answer_text": "You have no idea what your ancestors have been through and put in your DNA. You might have had an ancestor with a traumatic event related to a loud noise and somehow it is in your DNA still. Evolution apparantly hasn't taken care of it then. Or you might suffer from hypersensitivity. Some people suffer from this. It means that their senses are very sensitivie. They pick up sounds very easily even if they are not loud. This would mean that loud sounds would be relatively more annoying to hear for these people than they are for people with a lower treshold when it comes to sounds. It all depends on where your treshold has been set.  ",
