            "answer_text": "John Lennon loved Reverberation, as we all do, when singing. His engineer on Imagine, said if you give him loads of reverb in his cans (Headphones), he would sing like a dickey bird, all day long. Lennon would have loads of reverb in his cans, but NOT on the recording, that would be of a \u201cDead Room\u201d. In the days of recording the album \u201cImagine\u201d, effects were analogue, not digital as they are now. (Though some effects, can use both, to create that \u201cOlder\u201d Sound). In Reverberation Effects, the Reverb was made by a spring, which could break, called Spring Reverb. Once the spring has broken, it would be sent back for a new one to be fitted, or just scraped. The Engineer on Imagine, had not noticed that the spring was broken, it actually rattles. If you turn up the sound from the original vinyl record of the Song Imagine, it distorts. If it distorts, it was not engineered properly. I think the digital ones now don\u2019t, they've been Digitally Remastered. No doubt the original mistake, could be rectified by the remix, but I am no Engineer, so I don\u2019t know how they would do it, but it would be software, and no doubt, those bloody algorithms. The real reason we sing in the bath, is because with tiles, the room has high reverb. To test the reverb of a room, clap your hands hard, and listen to how fast it dies away. However, in the recording process, Engineers, and Record Producers, like a \u201cDead Room\u201d, (no reverb). This is so they can add it to the mix, but once it\u2019s there in the original recording, onto the Multi-Track Tape, you can\u2019t take it out. When the final mix is done, ALL the Multi-Tracks are heard as the finished song, so a balancing act is done. You cannot balance the tracks if one was recorded with a lot of reverb. Both musicians and especially singers, need a room with reverb, it is extremely difficult without it. All music is Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release, ADSR, this is helpful to a musician, because now, shaping your sound, you know the ingredients to sculptor your sound. Echo, by non-musicians, is what they think reverberation is, but it\u2019s not, it is actually entirely different. I like the first part of Echo, that gives a reflection, but hate the lesser repeat of the sound, which is what Echo is. Now-a-days there is a lot of talk about reflections, harmonics, which can give another dimension to the instrument. Slide Guitar is rich with these sounds, also harmonicas. The Blues Musicians love these, \u201chighlights\u201d, giving a richer sound landscape, and added volume. I can just see Robert Johnson busking, and a white lady covering her child\u2019s ears, so they would not be corrupted by \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Music\u201d. As for singing, John Lennon hated hearing his singing voice, he would cringe. Modern music is built on contemporary sounds, we do not go for \u201cTrained Singers\u201d, but learning how not to damage your vocal cords, breathing, and hitting notes, are still important. I love Dylan\u2019s voice, my Brother hated it, \u201cyou pays your money, and you take your choice\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no real way to define what is a \"good singer.\" People like various singers for reasons even they may not be able to explain. Was Bob Dylan a good singer? Objectively maybe not, but millions of people love the sound of his voice singing his own songs. I think John Lennon was a great singer of his own songs. Maybe Paul was objectively a better singer, but I don't want to hear him doing John's stuff and vice versa. It's true that the demos are pretty rough and I think John needed a lot of takes to get a good one that was in tune (no auto tune then!). On the other hand, they played thousands of live shows and John sang lead at least half the time, so he was a very experienced performer. His voice may be kind of thin and nasal, but that's part of what makes it distinctive, along with the roughness when he pushes it. There is a rawness that seems emotionally authentic and fits the soul-baring quality of his music. ",
