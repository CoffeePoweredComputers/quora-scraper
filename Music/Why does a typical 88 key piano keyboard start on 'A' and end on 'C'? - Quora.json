            "answer_text": "Different manufacturers used different keys to start and end with. Steinway designed keybeds with A as the first note and C at the highest. This layout was adopted when keyboard manufacturers wanted to replicate an acoustic piano\u2019s keybed layout. Keyboard manufacturers can choose to use other layouts. I have noticed my grandfather\u2019s old piano starting with G, and ending on E if Im right, not sure what the make is. However, since keyboards also offer other sounds, many of which are written with specific keys in mind (percussive sounds are arranged over an 88 key layout in specific ways) regardless of which patch you use (rock kit, jazz kit, etc.,) it makes more sense to keep the layout unchanged. This also allows us the additional benefit of using MIDI messages more efficiently than \u2018optimizing\u2019 them for every different layout. Everything that becomes a standard tends to replace everything else that went before it. Just like the USB replacing previously existing DIN connectors with various shapes and sizes! And with each new version of USB replacing itself, it just proves the point. The same is obvious in the field of musical instruments. Have a look at the full size seaboard. Its the same layout. Steinway engineers may not have had such a far reaching idea in mind when they went about their blueprint. But here we are. Simple answer, it was simply chosen, and the rest of us decided to go with it. I have also come across certain theories that A is the first alphabet and the same convention is used here. Which could be true, but since I have noticed pianos using other conventions, Id like to get better information on this before confirming this as the reason, than happy coincidence. There is also another explanation that the natural notes (white keys) in the first octave, starting from A, form the Aeolian scale (natural minor scale), and that this was the popular scale than the major scale during Gregorian times. Which could be true, but doesnt explain why the Organ (which actually existed much before the piano, did not accommodate this feature) while the piano, which arrived much later and is a considerably new instrument, has this feature. I shall leave this as yet another interesting theory for now, than claim this to be the case until I can get more information on this. My guess would be that Steinway took a more practical approach, as the cost of having to put up with bass strings going below A, while producing good tone, does not allow mass market production, among other things. This layout enabled production of spinets, console pianos, etc., for budget pianists/families/tutors, to teach on, and as a result became the standard. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t looked this up, so this is my guess: The dictating concept is the limit of human hearing. The lowest note A0, which vibrates at 28 Hz is just about at the spot where we cease to hear a frequency and start to hear beatings. C8 (4186Hz), the highest note resonates at a speed where it starts to become difficult to discern the pitch. The reason that we don\u2019t use G at the bottom or D at the top I would suspect has a large bit to do with our \u201cC\u201d centric music system. Our lowest note is not C1 since at 33Hz there is still a bit of space on the bottom end where one can hear even lower notes. The lower you go the heftier the piano frame needs to become, so there is likely some practicality issues to this. If you look at a so called Jazz Boesendofer which has an extra octave on the bottom end, you see that it is a massive instrument. It\u2019s \u201c0\u201d octave is mostly there just to give supporting resonance to the higher notes. Nobody writes for that lowest octave, so you either change arrangements or you improvise down there. Regardless, it sounds quite boomy. Possibly there might also be some connection to the lowest note of a five string counter-bass sometimes being B. There might be an equivalency issue here - but I suspect we bottom out at A0 more for human hearing issues. Also, at the top range, C8 seems to be generally the highest usable note. You can play some artificial third flageolets on a violin which go higher, but you\u2019re really pushing it. The soprano flute (the normal one) usually tops out at C8. If you want even higher then you need a piccolo and it\u2019s going to sound rather screechy. ",
