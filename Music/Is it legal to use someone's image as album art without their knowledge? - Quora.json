            "answer_text": "This is like asking \u201cis it legal to download a book without the author knowing about it?\u201d What determines the legality isn\u2019t whether or not the owner knows that you\u2019ve done it, but whether the material is properly licensed. So, for example, if by \u201csomeone\u2019s image\u201d, you mean \u201can image someone owns\u201d, and they have granted the right to license use of the image to someone else (e.g., they\u2019re making it available via a stock art site), and you have licensed it through that third party, then yes, it would be perfectly legal to do so, even though they don\u2019t know that you\u2019re doing it. From a legal perspective, what matters is that you have properly licensed the image. It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not the owner of the image personally knows that you have done so. The same applies if you mean \u201can image of someone\u201d. If you have properly licensed the right to use the image, it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not the person appearing in that image knows. Similar to the above, if you license an image of someone from a stock art site, and the owner of the image obtained the proper model release from that person, then it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not that person knows you are using their image.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really understand why people ask Quora questions about legal matters. We can tell you what we think, but clearly, we\u2019re not attorneys, so you\u2019d better not rely on anything anyone here tells you. Anyway, my best opinion is this: if there is any profit to be made from our images, then we are each entitled to it. At least I believe that is the legal principle involved. So if you do not get an agreement about the use of someone\u2019s image, then the image-holder can sue you for a portion of the profits - and possible damages for invasion of their privacy. I know I would. Thanks Benjamin, for the compliment of the A2A. ",
