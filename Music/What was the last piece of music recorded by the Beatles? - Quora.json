            "answer_text": "A fascinating thread trying to answer a vague question. I came to this thread looking for an answer to the question \u2018when did the Beatles last play together (simultaneously) and on which song? There are a number of candidates given below, but using McDonald\u2019s Revolution in the Head and Lewisohn\u2019s The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, I think I figured it out: On Friday July 25th 1969, the four Beatles laid down the basic track of Polythene Pam/She Came in Through the Bathroom Window as band with each playing their respective instruments with vocals. On Monday August 4th, they began work on Because, the last new song all 4 worked on together. As others have said below, Ringo contributed a high-hat to the other three (through headphones) whilst they recorded the 3-part harmonies. This wasn\u2019t recorded, but was part of putting the song together and clearly part of the performance. On Tuesday 5th August vocal overdubs were added to The End - but this didn\u2019t include Ringo (who didn\u2019t sing on this track). On Thursday August 7th further vocal and guitar overdubs for The End - again, no Ringo. On Friday 8th August drum and bass overdubs were added to The End - no John or George. On Monday August 11th, vocal overdubs were added to I Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy) and Oh Darling - John, Paul and George but no Ringo (who didn\u2019t contribute vocals to either song). On Weds 20th August I Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy) was mixed and edited (no new performances/overdubs recorded) and the running order/compilation of the whole album was overseen by all four Beatles - the last time they were together in the studio and possibly ever. So, the last time they played together as an ensemble band was Polythene Pam/She Came in Through the Bathroom on July 25th 1969. The last time they all performed together simultaneously was for Because on August 4th - also the last new song they all worked on together. And of course the last time they were all together in the studio (not playing) was Wednesday 20th of August. This rather makes sense, as when the Anthology collection was released in the 1990s, McCartney said the Baldwin harpsichord used in Real Love (which opens the song) was chosen because it was used on the last track they all recorded together - Because. Quite poetic really. On the question below of Real Love, I\u2019ll just point out it was recorded nearly a year after Free As A Bird in February 1995 - thus clearly the last Beatles song to which all 4 contributed a performance (if not together).

            "answer_text": "I believe it's \"Oh Darling\" from Abbey Road. It's all about definitions, but if not that, then it's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Because\", \"I Me Mine\" or \"Free As a Bird\", and to a lesser extend, \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Read below for my reasons for all of these.  There's a lot of subjectivity in this question. Whether you mean \"any recording ever with collaboration by the members\", then there're lots of recordings, as they peppered their performances among one anothers albums throughout their remaining careers. \"Oh Darling!\" - 1969If you are talking about in the 60's and early 1970 when the band was still officially formed, then the literature on the time when the band was together is a bit unclear, and even a bit contradictory, but it would seem that it was \"Oh Darling!\" from Abbey Road, being the last of all of them in the studio at the one time playing their regular instruments. \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" 1969-2003If you're talking about new music recorded which was released under The Beatles' name, then it could be Harrison's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" by George Harrison from the Cirque du Soleil Love album, for which new string recordings were added to Harrison's acoustic demo of the song by George Martin and his small orchestra in 2003. \"Because\" - 1969\"Because\" was the last one which had all of John, Paul and George sing vocals all together. Contrary to what many people suggest, \"The End\" was recorded much earlier in the Abbey Road sessions. \"I Me Mine\" - 1970While the lion's share of Let It Be was recorded before Abbey Road, additional recordings did go into its final product, such as Harrison's \"I Me Mine\", however Kennon wasn't involved by this time, so it depends on whether you consider his involvement as being paradigm. \"Free As a Bird\" - 1977-1995If you mean \"a collaboration with all four members\", then the last of which is probably \"Free As a Bird\" from 1995, because it was recorded by Lennon in '77, and then added to 18 years later by the other surviving three members.  \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" 1967I find it more interesting following Lennon-McCartney's songwriting career, as a side note. I would like to know what the last \"eyeball-to-eyeball\" song they wrote. From some pretty tedious investigations, it would seem that \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" fits the bill, and to the puritans of The Beatles, their last truly joint work could be, in ways, considered to have been their last real recorded song, as anything that followed may be considered to have been the fork off into their solo works.
