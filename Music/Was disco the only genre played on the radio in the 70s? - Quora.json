            "answer_text": "Here in the U.K. disco was by no means the only genre of pop music played on the radio in the 1970s, at least as far as I can remember. I recall doing a lot of radio listening in the 1970s too, because during the middle and latter part of this decade listeners began to have more choice once more, just as they did in the fondly remembered era of offshore pirate radio stations which operated off the British coast between 1964 and 1967. A number of new commercial radio stations took to the air from about 1974 onwards, whereas previously pop music was only heard on BBC Radio One and (in the evenings) on Radio Luxembourg. In my local city of Notttingham the commercial station Radio Trent began broadcasting in July 1975 (when the number one record was \u201cI\u2019m Not in Love\u201d by 10 c.c.), having recruited from Radio Luxembourg the popular Canandian DJ David \u201cKid\u201d Jensen. Pictured below is a nostalgic jigsaw puzzle entitled \u201cSpirit of the 1970s\u201d which features toys, magazines, TV programmes and pop music of the 1970s. As you can see, the jigaw features \u201cDonny, David and Michael\u201d, Abba, punk and \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d. Also featured is the popular TV programme \u201cStarsky & Hutch\u201d starring Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul, and David Soul (who played Hutch) had a number one hit single here at the start of 1977 with \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up On Us\u201d.  In the early part of the 1970s music aimed at young people of school age, as advertised on the front page of \u201cPop-Up !\u201d became very popular here, with The Osmonds and David Cassidy having a number of hits. David Cassidy also gained many followers through appearing on TV in \u201cThe Partridge Family\u201d, and indeed there were one or two records in the charts attributed to The Partridge Family. A year or two later the Scottish group The Bay City Rollers also became popular, especially with the kids. Of course, the group that took off in 1974 when they won the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \u201cWaterloo\u201d was the Swedish group Abba. They were probably the artists of the 1970s who sold more records than anyone else and whose records were played the most on the radio. In fact between 1974 and 1981 Abba had nineteen Top 10 hits here, and nine of them reached number one. Although Abba\u2019s music was not really in the disco genre I appreciate that many of their songs were very suitable for discos and went down well on the dance floor. You could not really have a 1970s jugsaw without including Abba on it. Probably the other three artists with the most U.K. chart hits in the 1970s were Rod Stewart (with 15 Top 20 hits and 5 number ones), Davod Bowie (with 17 Top 20 hits and one number one) and Elton John ( again with 17 Top 20 hits and one number one), though Elton\u2019s number one was \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\u201d with Kiki Dee, which was at number one for six weeks during the long, dry and hot hot summer of 1976. Punk, also featured in the jig saw, was also an important genre of music in the 1970s but because of its rebellious and iconoclastic nature was not played by radio stations as much as other genres of pop music. \u201cGod Save The Queen\u201d by the Sex Pistols, although banned by the BBC, reached number two in the charts, although many people believed that it actually reached number one, but was deliberately relegated to number two because of its controversial lyrics. Disco became very popular in the latter part of the 1970s, with the genre being given much publicity by the film \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d which again appears in the jig saw above. At this time Boney M were a group who had a number of hits that were ideal for the disco (such as \u201cRivers of Babylon\u201d) but above all this part of the decade is remembered for the way that the Bee Gees, who had been recording artists for at least ten years and had their first chart hits in 1967, reinvented themselves as the kings of disco music. At the end of the decade in December 1979 it seemed that disco music was already declining in popularity, especially when the number one slot in both the singles and album charts was occupied by Pink Floyd, with their single \u201cAnother Brick In the Wall taken from \u201cThe Wall\u201d LP. Although it may not have been surprising to see Pink Floyd at the top of the album charts, it certainly was a surprise to see them at the top of the singles charts. Finally, on personal note, I see that I have already answered on Quora the question What song defines the 1970's for you? In that answer I have indicated the song that for me epitomises the 1970s, probably because I so associate it with a wonderfully funny TV drama that was for me the TV programme that also epitomised the 1970s more than any other.
