            "answer_text": "In the 2018 Love Yourself Tour BTS played sold out concerts at the Tokyo Dome (57,000 seat capacity), the Kyocera Dome (51,000 seat capacity), the Nagoya Dome (40,500 seat capacity), the Fukuoka Yahuoka! Dome (52,500 seat capacity). Theoretically, if their stage doesn\u2019t eat up any of the seating area or whatever, that means 200,000 people, give or take, attended BTS concerts.  2018's best-selling live artists are Ed Sheeran, Bruce Springsteen and BTS, per Stubhub According to StubHub BTS was 19th best selling concerts in Japan, so IDK, 200k people isn\u2019t peak? BTS was the 2nd best selling concert worldwide, after Ed Sheeran. One other thing to consider is that BTS had all of their Japanese TV appearances canceled due to a fairly aggressively political WWII image/statement on one of Jimin\u2019s shirts. It was a whole thing. Despite this, BTS concerts remained fully sold and packed. BTS concert in Japan draws crowds despite controversy over A-bomb image BTS starts its Japan tour this week  Burn the Stage: The Movie (2018) \u2605 Box Office Mojo Data  *Pet peeve: You\u2019re going to list all of Colorado together, but list Dallas and Plano separately, like they are different places? I literally lived in 2 block swatch where my street address was Dallas, but all my services were from Plano\u2014water, trash, police, ambulance, everything but my zip code! Plano is a suburb! It should not have its own line when they didn\u2019t even list a single city in Colorado, because we all spread here\u2026 The BTS Wings Tour documentary Burn the Stage: The Movie (2018) made approximately (2nd most) $3.63 million in the USA during its original run, (3rd) $2.64 million in Korea. It made (1st) $3.86 million in Japan. Does this mean they sold more tickets in Japan than the US? Not necessarily. Average movie ticket price in the US is $9.14, Japan 1,300\uffe5 or $12.02. That means on average Japanese movie goers paid about 33% more for their tickets, so that comes out to about 397k US tickets purchased vs. 321k Japanese tickets purchased. So, probably more tickets were sold in the US than Japan, but because movie tickets cost more in Japan, the movie made the most money there. On the other hand, in my city the movie had no matinee showings, no coupons, no discounts, only on the big digital screen that costs $13. My guess is that for this particular movie, $9.14/ticket is low, just based on the list of cities, even without all of that malarkey. So, maybe more Japanese BTS stans went after all. \u00af\\(\u30c4)/\u00af   Face Yourself - Wikipedia BTS\u2019s April 2018 Japanese album Face Yourself was RIAJ certified platinum. Face Yourself (FYS) debuted at 43 on Billboard 200, the highest a Japanese album has ever charted on Billboard. FYS charted #1 on Japanese weekly album chart Oricon, #1 on Billboard Japan Hot Albums, #1 Billboard US World Albums, and it ended the year at #7 on Oricon. See Wikipedia for more stats.  In November of 2018 BTS released Japanese versions of Fake Love & Airplane pt.2 with new mvs. They are banging. Do yourself a favor and catch that. The release was certified Double Platinum by RIAJ.  The US streamed a lot more than Japan did last year. The US accounted for the most views at 552 million views vs. Japan in 4th place at 337 million views. That\u2019s still more than actual Koreans who came in 6th at 300 million views (though they can watch on Naver\u2019s V-Live app now; that we can\u2019t, but Naver\u2019s not the thing here that it is there.) Anyway, statistically, Japan is their largest single country international market. They make most of their money there. That\u2019s why they release albums in Japanese. That said, it isn\u2019t where they\u2019re most popular, statistically. That\u2019s Vietnam. Japan is #5 on the BTS Global Heat Map, a weighted statistical model. Fifth sounds lame, but it\u2019s actually still insanely popular\u2014if you check out the scale, BTS is outperforming the average artists nearly 5 to 1. BTS' global heatmap - ChartMasters So, yes, BTS is very popular in Japan, but maybe not the most popular artists there. Fake Love finished at #13 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, but Twice had 2 songs in the top 20 (Wake Me Up & TT), plus one in the Top 10 (Candy Pop). In the Top 30 BTS had DNA & Mic Drop, Twice had What Is Love & Likey. BTS doesn\u2019t chart again until Don\u2019 Leave Me at 96. Twice has several other songs. BlackPink Ddu-du Ddu-du hit at 57, Momoland Bboom Bboom at 62, and I think that\u2019s it for KPOP on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 2018 Year End List. Clearly if there\u2019s a favorite KPOP artist, it\u2019s Twice who is about to make a release in Japanese!  ",
