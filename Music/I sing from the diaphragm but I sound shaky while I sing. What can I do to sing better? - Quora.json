            "answer_text": "This means you utilize breath support but not breath control.  This will give you a hard to control, shaky and/or quickly fluctuating vibrato sometimes humorously known as \"goat vibrato\".  It can be easily improved upon with a few weeks of regular exercise of breath control exercises.   Get a stopwatch ready.  Put your hand in front of your mouth about 3-4 inches away.  Take a deep, slow breath until your diaphragm is almost full.  Breathe in a little bit more air quickly and hold it for a moment.  Using your diaphragm, slowly let the air out so that you can barely feel the stream of air on your hand.  Avoid using your throat to slow the stream of air.  Try to make the exhalation last over 30 seconds.  Do this 10 times a day.  As you get better at it, try to increase the amount you exhale until you are about at 1 minute .  This will help you develop very strong breath control which will help you to let air out more slowly so that your vibrato slows down and you can control the air better.  This book has everything you need you need to understand the inner workings of the anatomy and mechanics of singing, a trouble shooting diagram, and easy to follow step-by step exercises to fix every issue that singers face from tone to vowel production to high notes.

            "answer_text": "Usually in those cases where the voice is wobbly with good breathing one or both of these problems makes a big difference. Not 100% of a fix for the breathing issues, but a decent start: 1 if your understanding of breathing is distending your stomach on the inhale, you\u2019ll wanna learn a more comprehensive breathing. Go to someone with experience or an Alexander Technique teacher can do it instead\u2014usually better. Study breathing until it feels like your hips widen and there is expansion downwards toward the floor through the \u201cpelvic cage\u201d on the inhale. Study with someone excellent or an Alex teacher. Beginning teachers might not understand this fully. 2 your sternum and chest are usually coming down on the exhale when the voice wobbles. If you can prevent this from happening (without holding it up physically using tension and muscles of the back), it usually does a lot to solve or totally solves the wobble. You won\u2019t be able to do #2 most likely until you have #1 in the bag. <3 Eleonor, owner/teacher at Singing Lessons NYC 520 8th Ave New York, NY 10018 212/736.3118 ",
