            "answer_text": "The answers that I believe you will get from the majority of people are Led Zeppelin IV, which clocks in at 42 minutes long, The Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd), which is also 42 minutes long, and Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band (The Beatles), which is 39 minutes long. My personal favorite album that is under an hour long would probably be either Abbey Road by The Beatles or Highway to Hell by AC/DC though. ",
