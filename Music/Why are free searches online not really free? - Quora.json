            "answer_text": "The concept of \u2018Free\u2019 is a powerful one, it is used all across the world of business and commerce to generate attention and interest, free gifts, free samples, trial periods, we are all very familiar with this; there is even an entire business model based on \u2018Free\u2019 which is called the \u2018Freemium\u2019 model. We all enjoy the opportunity of obtaining something of obvious value without having to pay money for it, this seems to be hard wired into the human social world, another primary aspect of our human nature is described as being \u2018reciprocity\u2019, which refers to the emotional response we experience when someone gives us something of value, we feel inclined to reciprocate, which is the verb of reciprocity. Quid Pro Quo has been spoken about at great length recently, and what this ancient latin expression means in English is simply: This for that, or an exchange of value, you give me something and I respond by providing something else of value to balance the equation, to \u2018pay back\u2019. So, this very natural state of affairs is something that is broadly applied all across our societies, the world of commerce and trade. We can become cynical and say that nothing is ever truly completely free, there is always a hidden dimension of intent, nobody actually gives anything of true value away, they will always expect some kind of \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 or return for their apparent generosity! This is probably true, but even if it is true, does this have to be a bad thing? What we can say is, that if people end up receiving something which is valuable to them, which benefits their situation in some way, and by so doing they also respond in some way which also benefits the provider, then nobody has lost anything and the results are favorable to all concerned. In other words, we have to treat each case as a unique instance, and assess what is happening. Our social world is driven by all kinds of agreements, exchanges, compromises and deals; we should regard these in terms of their intentions. Trickery and deception have always been a part of our commercial world, one of the oldest pieces of advice we know about comes from the ancient world, yet another latin expression: Caveat Emptor, which translates into English as being \u2018Let the buyer beware\u2019. We are strongly advised to be always vigilant, observant, and aware that people are out to trick us out of our cash. However, because there might be trickery involved, this is not sufficient reason to dismiss all that is offered and presented to us, we are just alerted to the potential for deceptive people to be practicing their murky trade. Discernment is gained through experience, or not. The very famous \u2018Desiderata\u2019 states that: \u201cExercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.\u201d I think this verse puts it very succinctly, we need to be wary, but not paralysed! If we wanted to be 100% certain of each and every transaction, of all our dealings we would never get round to doing anything, and for some people this is the case; I have met some individuals who will never purchase anything from the internet, they suspect everyone of being a scamster, so they will never have access to the wonderful convenience of online shopping, this is more common than you might think. There is always an element of risk, of potential calamity in life, for some people this is intolerable and they strive to minimise that risk in all they do, these are the people who refuse to accept risks. Nothing would ever be achieved, or discovered if people refuse to accept risk, luckily there are always people who measure risk and conclude the potential gains and benefits justify them facing the risk, these are the brave souls, the adventurous and curious ones. In terms of online search, by which I think you mean Google searches, while this is free of upfront charges it represents billions of dollars (more like trillions) in terms of commercial transactions and generated business; people seek goods and services along with information and entertainment, so Google search is a primary business platform. Once again we have the quid pro quo of business at work here, people are willing to pay for inclusion on search, and they also strive to appear as near the front as possible for \u2018organic\u2019 search - the ranking of websites and pages that Google determines from its \u2018Rankbrain\u2019 and other algorithms. People spend money to optimise their identity and publications, they also spend lots of time and energy, studying and learning how best to present their goods and services online. So, free search is never entirely free at all, but this is not necessarily a negative, or unethical situation, it represents what has been going on for thousands of years, the commercial energy of people and their striving to make a living, \u2018caveat emptor\u2019 is the advice, and we need to respect this and take heed, but don\u2019t allow it to paralyse you or make you ultimately cynical, it is just life and this is what we are all involved with.
