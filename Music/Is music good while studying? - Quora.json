            "answer_text": "Back when life used to be normal , I was studying in the reading room of my college . I looked around and noticed that most students are plugging away at their studying with their headphones on\ud83c\udfa7. I wondered is it actually beneficial to listen to music while you study? In this answer I'll explain if studying with music is a good idea or not.  There are 3 key factors in determining whether music is beneficial while studying :- \u25aa\ufe0ePersonality type \u25aa\ufe0eType of work \u25aa\ufe0eType of music  PERSONALITY TYPE Researchers found that music had a detrimental effect in performance on introverts but less so for extroverts.This aligns with Eysenck's theory of Cortical Arousal States stating that  Type of WORK Now there has been substantial evidence that the type of work is a key factor in determining whether or not music is appropriate when it comes to reading . Most Studies have demonstrated that music has detrimental effects. But when it comes to Arithmetic, the results are quite mixed. Type of MUSIC Vocal music is more distracting than instrumental music. It is so bcoz with vocals, our brain is multitasking by processing the voices while we are trying to study . Now the moment that you've all been waiting for : Should you study with music or in silence as with most things in science?  It depends My advice is as follows: \u25aa\ufe0eIf you are going to study with music, be sure to choose music that lacks vocal. Vocals are going to be distracting and ultimately much more likely to have a detrimental effect on your studying. Beyond that choose music you enjoy. Unfortunately, the scientific literature is far from conclusive. So self-experimentation becomes very important. \u25aa\ufe0eI had quickly determined from my own experience that listening to music while reading was on average more distracting than reading in silence, but when it came to cranking through Physics practice problems music made the experience more enjoyable. You will likely find similar results, but try it out for yourself. \u25aa\ufe0eYou'll notice that some types of work are more conducive to music than others. I also learned that having a good study song on repeat helped me get in the zone and study for longer periods of time without fatigue. This is supported by The Changing State hypothesis, which suggests that rapidly changing music will distract you from learning and ultimately decrease your performance \u25aa\ufe0eI believe that music has helped me study for longer periods of time. I often start working in silence. And as I feel myself getting bored or my mind wandering I'll put on some instrumental music that I enjoy . With this newfound burst in energy and positive vibes, I'm able to Marathon with my studying for much longer. My suggestion to you is to try the same. Use music as a boost when your momentum begins to drop . With this advice I would like to conclude my answer. Keep Calm and keep Studying\ud83d\ude42 ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I'm glad to answer this question and I hope it answers it! I read a comment on here saying \u201cno, because multitasking slows down brain activity\u201d well, this may be true but remember, your brain is multitasking all the time! The more you do, the slower it may get but I'm still not sure. But to my opinion on this matter! I say, it is a good thing! Why? Because it, for me allows me to concentrate more. The music you listen to is wanted, so not really a distraction. But, let's say Tommy from next door decided to cut his grass, play loud music (this is distracting you) and decided to sing at the top of his lungs, this would definitely put you off your study. Listening to music that you enjoy and you like it but not to much, it actually calms you down and makes you more relaxed. (No matter what genre) I know this from experience as I did this during my study period. Trust me, being relaxed during study is way better than being stressed and having many unwanted noise! I decided to have an experiment during my study. One day I listened to music studying maths and the other day I studied maths with no music. I done the same level of questions and I did similar sort of questions but not the same. It turns out that I, worked better with the music. (Studied the same time, began at the same time etc) it wasn't much of an increase, but It was within 5% between one another. Music can help, only slightly. I do recommend a mix with both, However, I do suggest a little more of the silence because at the end of the day, you will be in silence for the exam! -Reece ",
