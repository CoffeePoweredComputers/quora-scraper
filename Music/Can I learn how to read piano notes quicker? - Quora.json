            "answer_text": "I love the question: Can I learn how to read piano notes quicker? I am and adult person who dreamed to be a musiician, but life has been different for me. Now I am studying musiic and choose as my second instrument piaano. My first, is accordion a pianno. The I learrned studying basic theory and by intuition, is very hard to me understand in theory. The most difficult actually is to harmonize. I want to share some tips to learrn pianno as below. 1. S.h.e.e.t Musssic Sheeet Musssic is the most popular way to learrn new songs. This is how I learrned piaano for twelve years, and it was the least effective way for me to leearn. Sure, once you FINALLY leearned a new song it was cool, but the pain to get there just wasn\u2019t worth it. There was one song (Maple Leaf Rag by Scott Joplin) I remember was so complicated that it took me a year to leearn. Who has time for that? Leearning how to read S.h.e.e.t musssic in the first place takes a lot of time. And even if you know how to read S.h.e.e.t muusic, it still takes a long time to learn a new song via S.h.e.e.t muusic. If you weren\u2019t born with some amazing natural ability to read S.h.e.e.t muusic, I recommend you steer clear. 2. \u201cBy Ear\u201d Next, we have \u201cBy Ear.\u201d Some people are born with an \u201cear\u201d for mussic. They can recognize notes, chords, and melodies by listening. They can play the piiano based purely on something they heard. I\u2019m seriously jealous of these people. I\u2019ve tried and tried to get better at this technique, but sadly it isn\u2019t my thing either. By now you are seeing that I\u2019m really not some mussical prodigy, but a regular person like you! 3. Online courses This is one of the best and fastest way to learn piiano now. Details: PiannoForAll course 4. YouTube Tutorials Third, we have YouTube Tutorials which are getting more and more popular as people get mobile devices, tablets, and anything else that allows them to open the YouTube app while sitting at their piiano or keyboard. YouTube tutorials can be great, but if you really think about it, they have a striking resemblance to sheeet music. Instead of the notes and rhythm being written on a piece of paper, you have someone showing you in a video EXACTLY what to play and when to play it. I always say that typical piiano instruction turns you into a robot\u2013if you\u2019re parroting back what someone else tells you to do, are you really learning music? 5. Chords & Improvisation Finally, we have Chords & Improvisation. I\u2019m a big fan of this method. Obviously, the above methods do work for some people or they wouldn\u2019t exist. But for the average person who doesn\u2019t want to play piano professionally, who doesn\u2019t have a lot of time, and who wants to be able to sound like they know what they\u2019re doing as quickly as possible, then Chords & Improvisation.

            "answer_text": "To improve sight reading, you need to learn to NOT read everything. Ill explain it this way, with English first. Read the following : A That is a single letter word. Easy? Lets add another letter (N) to it. Read this : AN Now try one more letter (R) : RAN Keep going, try this : RANG Notice how the meaning changes each time with just the addition of a single letter. And each has its own context. One cannot be used in place of the other. Try a few more, here is the same block with one more letter (E) : RANGE At this point even the pronunciation changes. Last letter Ill add here (O) : ORANGE Once again, the meaning, context as well as pronunciation has changed.  Similarly, when reading sheet music, you will most likely start off with single note phrases. Later you may go on to two-part harmony, followed by 3 part harmony, and so on. The harmony may be either via counter point or through parallel movement. Your focus should not be on reading letter by letter, rather in the chord block, just as you would read words in a sentence rather than each alphabet within the word. The blocks below are some of the very easily identifiable patterns :  You will most likely use the same fingering pattern for most of these chords. So train your hands to play these patterns easily. This is the equivalent of pronunciation in spoken language. Now look at the pattern below :  Notice how the inversions above look similar, and your hand position will be more or less constant when playing this \u20186 4\u2019 chord. Learn the positions for each of the figured bass chords, that you come across in your style of music, it will help you play as you read. When you read block chords, look at only one of the notes (lowest or highest), and the pattern (root, 1st Inv, 2nd Inv, major, minor, etc.,) and play. Dont read all the notes. The same applies to reading broken chords in the form of triplets, or Alberti bass patterns. Next, when you come across patterns like these :  In the first bar, for right hand, there is a run that starts from D, and goes on for a total of 6 notes, or you can say it ends at Bb. Here, you wont need to read every note in between, just read the pattern as first note, followed by number of notes, or first note till last note, and then play all the notes in between on that key signature. One more pointer before I submit the answer on this one : Look for repeated patterns! In the same example above, notice how bars 3 and 4 have the same melody in the bass clef, as the 1st and 2nd bars for the treble clef. So you already know the notes and rhythm. Just focus on playing them. There are different ways to improve your sight reading further. Always focus on identifying familiar patterns and repetitions.  Try reading the following names written in English :  This is just to show you that unless you are familiar with this subject, you cannot read these as easily as you can read other words. The same goes with music, and you may not be able to play all the styles as you can your favourite pieces. Some really do take practice and are not meant for \u2018sight reading\u2019 by the average musician in general. ",

            "answer_text": "The turning point for me was instead of attempting to quickly identify what the note on the staff is I focused on the interval between the notes. I find that focusing on the intervals comes more naturally than thinking what the note is, as that usually takes me a moment to think about. The way I implement this is when I am practicing I consciously think of what the interval is. Eventually many intervals become second nature when I see them. The only time I really need to identify what the note is when it is relatively far away from the previous note. If your goal is to get better at reading notes more quickly then spend a lot of practice time site reading different pieces. Once you have played a song a lot and have essentially memorized it you are not practicing identifying the notes as much because you do not have to think about them before you play them. I am just a beginner pianist myself but these suggestions help me! Good luck with your playing! ",

            "answer_text": "Want to learn how to read music? New to the piano? Reading piano notes is the first step for beginners to tackling a piece of music. To be able to play the piano successfully, you must start learning how to read sheet music right off the bat. Follow these simple steps, and youll be reading piano notes in no time! Everybody learns best in different ways but personally I was getting nowhere until I tried this course: Pianoforall | Learn Piano & Keyboard | 200 Video Lessons I like having everything laid out so I can see myself progress through it and I know what I need to be working on. After youve memorized all of the letter names on the lines and spaces for your right hand (the treble clef), you can move on to reading piano notes on the bass clef, where the notes on the lines and spaces will be played with your left hand. Now, as you read through your song, play and sing the letter or numbers while playing, which will help you memorize the names of numbers of the notes on a piano. Once youve practiced this for a while, try erasing the letter names and testing yourself to see if you still remember the playing pattern and tune of the song. One of the most difficult things about learning how to read sheet music for the piano, as opposed to most other instruments, is that there is not just a single melody to be played. Piano music requires you to play more than one part at a time. Usually these parts are interconnected they are part of a chord that you need to be able to accurately read. Sheet music is read from left to right. The reasoning behind this is that music began as an exercise most focused on the progression of notes in a scale or mode in a horizontal fashion. When more than one voice was sounded together, they usually sang in unison and it was not till the 9th century that musicians became increasingly concerned with vertical harmony and polyphony. Begin to identify chord units and think about each measure in terms of chordal units. Most bars or measures of beginning piano music contain one or two chords. Sometimes these chords are arpeggiated, other times there is an alternation pattern of notes in the treble and bass in quick succession. Your success with this technique depends on your ability to identify which chord is being outlined. To do this, simply name the notes. In beginning sheet music youll most likely see either major or minor triads. Whether or not this technique is right for you depends largely on whether or not it yields a type of aha moment, where you can better visualize the spacing of your fingers and their placement on the keys. If you need further instruction on learning how to read piano notes, consider taking piano lessons. A professional piano teacher can walk you through these steps and ensure that youre building your skills on a solid foundation of music theory. Nice one for a beginner..But as a learner of keyboard, my challenge now is on ear-training-ie how to distinguish clearly soh sound for instance from lah or fah on a given key!.. How can u help?? Hi Im trying to learn a song from a piano book for my graduation but Ive only taken basic right hand piano lessons. I do not know how to play with my left hand but I also really want to play this song. Is there some way I can learn the song in time? ",

            "answer_text": "Everything in music has a \u201cshape\u201d. If you can learn to see chords as \u2018shapes\u201d rather than having to look at each individual note, you will become much faster at reading them. For example, If you build a C major in \u201croot\u201d position, you get: C-E-G. This \u201cshape\u201d will stay the same, even in different keys. For example, a D major in \u201croot\u201d position would \u201clook\u201d the same, in terms of arrangement of the note heads. Try to remember the shapes of everything you encounter. Keep a notebook! Most importantly, make a note of where the \u201croot\u201d note is in any chord shape that you encounter. In a C major (1st inversion), for example, the notes are arranged: E-G-C. The \u201croot\u201d is now on the \u201ctop\u201d of the chord. When I see this shape, I don\u2019t have to look at each individual note any more - I simply know that it is a \u201c1st inversion\u201d of some sort, and then I check the top note, which tells me that it must be a C major (IF we are in the key of C). At this point, once your brain recognizes which shape it is, and where the root of the chord is, you can take accidentals into account, as well as which key you are in. There are also apps that will continually show you different chord voicings over and over again, in random order, and you are tested on speed. ",

Find a music level that is comfortable for you. When you can go through music at a tempo and you make little to no mistakes, bump up the tempo. Almost every low skill sightreader I've met, play at a faster tempo then what they can comfortably play. And many quit also. Look for random pieces and play random measures. Also record yourself. Listen to how you sight read and makes notes of them and compare with notation. Analyze why did you mess up. Is there something you missed? Are there good parts you played and why? Instead of playing a chord maybe focus on the root note instead but make sure the note fingering matches what you would play, etc\u2026. ",

You might also look at eMedia piano lesson software at http://www.emediamusic.com/keyboard-piano-lessons/beginner-piano-method.html. Note that I work for the company, but I do think there are benefits particularly if you have a MIDI keyboard. The software teaches you to read and listens to you play to show you if you are hitting the correct notes. Also there are songs to put it all in context. And finally, there is the fingering issue. Knowing the names and locations of the notes is *not* the same as playing it correctly. If your fingering is wrong (on most instrument BTW, not just piano) then it can make playing even simple things difficult. ",

It's a holistic process, but I found that to get there, I laboriously read the notes and committed them to muscle memory. I realized this when I sat with a different edition of a piece with simple differences in pagination of the staves! Because of the different way the piece looked on the page, I played an almost memorized piece haltingly. Sight read simple pieces. Study them for a perhaps a half minute before playing. If you can't play it, then choose simpler pieces. And then move on to another piece. Do not allow yourself to learn that simple piece. These will be ridiculously simple pieces at first, a little humiliating for their simplicity. I visited the used sheet music section at a bookstore and bought a dozen beginning method books when I decided to improve my sight reading. ",

The goal is to play the passage perfectly 10 times in a row, at each tempo, gradually increasing the tempo until you are playing it at the intended tempo. It takes discipline to do this.

Everyone obsesses over being able to read pitch, but becoming a good rhythmic reader is also a HUGE piece of the skill. Even if your transcriptions are poor, the part of the brain that engages in doing it will be developed, along with your reading skills. Be sure to give your transcriptions to another musician so they can try to play it. That's the proof that you got it right or not. Then discuss how you could have transcribed it more clearly or accurately. You'll learn a lot! ",

From there you need to know that D always can be found between the set of 2 black keys and you can work out the names of the other keys using D as an anchor. If you want to become more fluent in finding the keys I recommend music apps that work like a video game such as Strike A Chord. Lesson 1 (which is free to download) covers the note names and you will master them 4 at a time! ",
