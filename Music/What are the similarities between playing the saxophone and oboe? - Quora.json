            "answer_text": "Being someone who has played both and loved it for over half a decade, I can say that there are more similarities than people may think. Of course, the two instruments are different; there\u2019s no denying that. One is a single reed while the other is double reed, one is made of metal while the other is made of wood, one is barely ever seen in orchestra while the other is pretty much never seen in jazz, etc. The biggest and most obvious similarity is that both are woodwinds. And while that may sound like the smart-aleck answer, that fact is what creates the other important similarities between the two. For one, because of how similar their ranges are, their fingerings are strikingly similar. (That made switching from sax to oboe in sixth grade very easy for me.) Another is in the embouchure: they may have different reed setups, but all reed instruments have basically a similar embouchure, and the way you adjust intonation with embouchure is basically the same with the two instruments. This actually helped me when I picked up soprano sax for the first time, because tuning on soprano and on oboe is basically the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 they are two completely different instruments, so the similarities would lie in the fact that they are both woodwind instruments. Otherwise, they have different mouth pieces, Oboe is a concert pitch instrument, while saxophone is an Eb instrument, the tone, the range, everything is different. ",
