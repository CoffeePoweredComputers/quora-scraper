These are often people who manage to hold on to God despite the best efforts of a society who loves to scapegoat (i.e. assign unbearable guilt and exact an unpayable price). The first time I remember consciously being confronted with the question of gay and lesbian believers was when I saw the film Trembling Before G-d (2001). The film is made from a Jewish perspective, but I was left with a strong impression of a people suffering for their faith and \u201cstriving with God\u201d. This is a curious aspect of Israel\u2019s identity \u2014 that they were not being defined by their struggles with other gods or other nations, but had to work out their own salvation with \u201cfear and trembling\u201d. And as a Christian, I could not help asking myself how Jesus might have responded. There are multiple examples where he engaged with the marginalised and spoke on their behalf \u2014 not despite his faith, but because of it. At each encounter, he would recognise and affirm the faith of these untouchables. Then he would turn around and rebuke the community who had cornered them. Finally, Jesus himself was scapegoated for disturbing the peace. We can guess whose peace was disturbed. It certainly wasn\u2019t any of the ordinary people whose honour and dignity he had restored before God (the word \u201cforgiven\u201d doesn\u2019t quite capture this implication in our litigious society). I am acutely aware of the fact that people, my own faith community very much included, have been trying (and mostly failing) to work this out culturally and theologically. Change is slow in coming. In the meantime, the more I read and engage with this little Israel among us, I find there is no place left to hide God\u2019s grace, which has so overwhelmed my own failings that all I have left to express is love and compassion. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you on my account. \u2014 Jesus (Matthew 5) ",

            "answer_text": "I lived as a conservative Christian for over 30 years. I have read the entire Bible in: New International Version, New King James Version, Holman Christian Standard Bible, and New Living Translation. I have also studied the Bible in a few other versions, I just haven\u2019t read the whole thing in any other versions. I have been a member of several different churches and at least attended several different types of Christian churches I feel very confident that I know and understand what the Bible has to say about homosexuality. The Bible does have kind of a LOT to say about homosexuality. There\u2019s at least one verse about cross dressing\u2026 probably a few, but not many. I sincerely don\u2019t recall a single verse on transsexual identification, which is a different issue. The verse I am aware of is in the Old Testament, and I feel certain any others would be too. According to the Bible and mainstream Christianity, Jesus is the fulfillment of the law, and there are a lot of other things that mainstream Christianity believes that effects. Based on my previous sincere beliefs (which resulted from a combination of intensive personal study and receiving broad based Christian teaching): Practicing homosexuality will result in going to hell (it\u2019s not about sexual orientation, it\u2019s about giving in to temptation to sin\u2026 it is engaging in homosexual acts that is sinful, not having homosexual desires). A small minority of Christians/churches do sincerely believe that practicing homosexuality can be Biblically justified, and that it is possible for Christians to be practicing homosexuals and go to heaven. If my beliefs were accurate, they would be unable to justify that position to God. They might be able to convince people, but God would NOT be persuaded. People can believe what they want to, but they would not have a chance in hell of convincing God on judgment day. The GOOD NEWS, from my perspective, is that GOD doesn\u2019t EXIST. As long as there is NO GOD, it really makes ZERO difference what they believe about it. I honestly believe it\u2019s perfectly safe for LGBTQ people to believe whatever they want to. When I transitioned, I couldn\u2019t \u201cjust change my beliefs based on what LGBTQ friendly people and churches believed\u201d. My beliefs were MY OWN BELIEFS\u2026 I couldn\u2019t just change them to accommodate my preference. If your beliefs are based on what someone else tells you, you might be able to be convinced. If you ACTUALLY have YOUR OWN BELIEFS, it\u2019s not real easy change them. It\u2019s a lot easier to change your beliefs when they are based on what someone else tells you. I really had to examine my beliefs and reach a sincere resolution that I had peace about. I DID that, and I have peace about what I believe again now. I\u2019m not trying to convert anyone, I really don\u2019t believe what people believe matters\u2026 as long as they are not using their beliefs to justify hurting other people (unfortunately, many religious people ARE guilty of that (including Christians, it\u2019s not \u201cjust a Muslim problem\u201d).

That is saying that there is sins that are more powerful than what Jesus did, which is pretty much blasphemy. People forget that God changes people. Their desires can change. The Gospel is powerful.

A lot of the LGBT community is non-Christian (for a myriad of reasons primarily Christians haven\u2019t given them good reasons to be Christians) and a lot of Christians haven\u2019t interacted with LGBT people. So I often get to be an insightful window for both groups (I have actually been able to chat quite freely about my faith with LGBT people and my gender identity/sexuality with Christians including faith leaders). I am honestly sad I don\u2019t know more, but I am fully aware of why. There\u2019s a lot of people in the LGBT community who have been hurt by Christians. There is a facebook group I\u2019m a part of that is for LGBT Christians and the stories in there sometimes just break my heart. I think that LGBT Christians have an interesting perspective on both. I could describe my transition and my faith being intertwined and I have heard other LGBT Christians speak about their experiences as an LGBT person giving them some unique insights into their faith. The Church is really missing out on these perspectives if they\u2019re going to continue pushing them away. I\u2019m very grateful my current church has been the exact opposite of that. ",

            "answer_text": "If they truly adhere to Christianity, and not some altered offshoot of it, they should be attempting to cease homosexual behavior. If they are legitimately trying to do this, yet are failing and fall back into it at times, I say welcome to the club. They are exactly like all Christians who are tying to limit sin yet falter. They should ask for forgiveness and attempt to do better next time. I fully accept these people as Christian and would be happy to try to help them in their walks and have them help me in mine. If, on the other hand, they have totally rejected clear Biblical teachings on homosexual behavior, or at minimum ignore those sections and therefore willfully and continously participate in it without any attempt to remove it from their lives because they don't believe it's a sin, then I wouldn't call them Christians. They could still be great people who adhere to some or many of the values the Bible promotes, but they have clearly given up on the Bible as the word of God and are trying to make it say something it doesn't through some pretty outlandish mental gymnastics. To me, Christians don't willfully and consistently do that. It's one thing to sin, know you are sinning, and legitimately attempt to stop sinning but fail. It's another to outright reject the clear cut teachings of the very book the religion is based on and just start measuring sin by whatever metric you see fit. Christians can and will do the former according to the Bible, but I've never quite understood how or why people would even want to do the latter and still refer to themselves as Christian. In short, my opinion on the Christianity of LGBT people or any other people has nothing to do with their sins. It has to do with whether or not their underlying worldview regarding those sins (and how they should respond to them) completely rejects obvious Biblical teachings. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I think it appropriate we turn to the Bible for a clear indication on whether you can be a Christian and LGBT. In Romans it talks clearly about sexual desires. \u201cTherefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another\u201d (Romans 1:24). It then goes on to speak about men being with other men. \u201cBecause of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\u201d (Romans 1:26\u201327) Corinthians also clearly talks about homosexuals, specifically directed towards those who are in the church. \u201cOr do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d (1 Corinthians 5:9\u201310). And again further in the passage (12, 13, 14). There are also other verses which I have not mentioned, that also talk about homosexuality. I think the evidence is clear. ",

Some of us feel abandoned by the congregation we grew up in. Some of us leave the faith. Some of us stay. Some of us decide to remain celibate for the rest of our lives. Some of us decide to get married. I think it\u2019s a very closed-minded statement to say the LGBT Christians (and even their allies) are not Christian. Just because some of us may have a different interpretation on the scripture doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s automatically wrong. My entire denomination (I\u2019m a Protestant) was formed because people had a different interpretation on the scripture. Many of us know why our fellow Christians think homosexuality is wrong, and we know why we agree, disagree, or just don\u2019t know what to think about that statement. Either way, we are all Christians, just maybe not cisgender or straight. Hope you have a good day! :) ",

LGBT+ i personally dont believe are doing anything wrong and I have nothing wrong with any lgbt living their best life they can but god probably even though he loves all equally judges us all equally. But I'm sure god wants to see you in church being who you are. Again I'm honestly not 100% where god stands on same sex/trans acts I'm sure he loves the people but doesnt like our actions? I dont know I'm not god and that's the thing I'm not god judges love all people. Love then as jesus did. ",

They need to experience God\u2019s love as you know it as they might reevaluate if participating in a relationship that was not designed or ordained by God biologically removes them from the grace of God.

One day it will be made manifest (or evident) the things that have occurred around us in the spirit realm. The Word tells us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers in high places. To truly seek God, we must deny ourselves and take up our cross daily and follow him. ",
