            "answer_text": "No. Elton John, whether you like him or not, is a musical genius. I saw him on an episode of \u201cInside the Actors Studio\u201d. When the subject came up of how he writes so easily to Bernie Taupin's lyrics he wanted to prove to the audience that he could do it. He asked a random student to hold up a book, any book, the more obscure the better. A student raised a book in the air and Elton said: \u201cTurn it to any page you would like and hand it to me\u201d. It turns out the book was Shakespeare (or something similar). Elton took the book and sat down at the piano. At first, he looked a bit confused and commented on how hard it was to read it, much less write music to it. He placed the book on his piano, on the page the student turned to and started playing. He actually played a very good melody to what must have been a very hard passage to even read. The audience was amazed. Those kinds of musical geniuses do not come around too often. ",
