James Stewart (1908 \u2013 1997) made his mark playing nice guys in movies such as \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d and \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington.\u201d By all accounts, he was as likable in real life as the characters he played, a refreshingly regular guy in his daily life (unlike some celebrities). As President Harry Truman once said, \u201cIf Bess and I had a son we\u2019d want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart.\u201d We\u2019re remembering the iconic actor by sharing a few of our favorite anecdotes from his personal life and, of course, watching a few of our favorite James Stewart films. James Maitland Stewart grew up in small-town Pennsylvania, the son of a hardware store owner. Throughout his career, his father often urged him to leave Hollywood and come back to Pennsylvania to settle down and lead a quiet, respectable life. When Stewart won his only Academy Award \u2014 in 1941, for \u201cThe Philadelphia Story\u201d \u2014 he sent it home to his dad. To his credit, Stewart\u2019s father displayed the Oscar prominently at his store. Stewart was good friends with Henry Fonda, despite their very different politics (Stewart was a staunch Republican, Fonda a devoted Democrat). For a time, they shared an apartment. In later years, their children remembered that one of their favorite pastimes was to build and paint model airplanes together. Stewart and his wife Gloria owned a dog, Beau, whom the family loved very much. When Stewart was on location in Arizona, Beau became very ill, and the vet called to say he needed to be put to sleep. Stewart replied, \u201cKeep him alive and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d He took an immediate leave of absence from the film, rushed home, and got to spend a few days with Beau before he said goodbye. Later, remembering petting his beloved dog\u2019s head at night, Stewart wrote a poem about Beau \u2014 one of many poems he wrote in his life. When he read \u201cBeau\u201d on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d both Stewart and Johnny Carson were moved to tears. Stewart put his successful film career on hold to serve in World War II. He was drafted but was then rejected because he fell five pounds short of the minimum weight requirement. But Stewart was eager to serve, and he bulked up in the gym until he was fit enough. A skilled pilot before he joined up, he served with distinction, earning medal after medal and rising from private to colonel in just four years. He remained in the U.S. Air Force Reserve for many years after the war, eventually gaining the rank of Major General. When Stewart returned to the U.S. after World War II was over, he had some understandable trepidation about going back to his old job. He considered an aviation career as a backup. But after taking some time to reassess his career, he accepted his first role in five years \u2014 playing George Bailey in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d Though the film received mixed reviews on its release, movie history shows that Stewart\u2019s decision to return to Hollywood \u2014 while continuing to serve his country in the Reserves \u2014 was a good one.
