            "answer_text": "Make you feel alive,huh! I see a lot of bad choices in the answers below. So let me give it a shot. Heroes by David Bowie. I first heard this song when Charlie goes through the tunnel in The Perks of being a Wallflower. It blended into the context of the movie and aptly fitted the context of the movie.Highway to Hell by AC/DC. A lot of the songs which I will be listing will have electrifying live performances. Just do yourself a favor and go watch its youtube official video. A group of half naked, old hippies moving around, singing and jumping. The movement of the crowd feels like a wave.Sex on Fire by Kings of Leon. These are one of those bands whose live performances are better than their original singles. The vocals of Caleb Followill are fucking majestic. It gives an effortless performance which those amazing vocals.Toss the Feathers by The Corrs. There are no lyrics in the song but it doesn\u2019t need any. I\u2019m not sure about feeling alive but it will surely leave you with a good mood.Into the Wild soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. Don\u2019t ever try to this listen without first seeing the movie of the same. It is all about context. You can\u2019t truly feel the essence of the lyrics, of the music, and of the setting until you have seen the movie. Go see the movie. Some of the best tracks from the album are Rise, Hard Sun, Far Behind and Guaranteed.I will add more when I find more. It is difficult to browse 1500+ songs. :p ",
