            "answer_text": "One of my favorite albums of the last ten years is Miguel\u2019s Kaleidoscope Dream. 2012 as a strong year for R&B, and this album was my favorite of the bunch. Of the many things I like about Kaleidoscope Dream, Miguel has a real knack for song structure. Every song is well written and well paced, and quite a few have great bridge sections. While I\u2019m fond of the bridges in \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back\u201d and \u201cThe Thrill,\u201d the example I present here is \u201cAdorn,\u201d his hit single that earned three Grammy nominations, including Song of the Year. As he does on many of his songs, he uses the brief bridge to set up a big vocal climax in the final verse, and he nails it here.  ",
