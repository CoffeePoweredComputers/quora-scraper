            "answer_text": "Tough question as they are both awesome \u2018jam\u2019 bands but I am partial (way) to WSP! Saw them both as they were starting out in the 90\u2019s and on through the years. Phish was always fun for sure. Widespread was so much more though to me. I think folks kinda had to choose who to follow more though because everyone was touring so much for awhile there it was really hard to follow both. Widespread Panic\u2019s music has more heart to me. Phish is just kinda fun music. Both had some radio airplay with a couple songs but never really \u2018sold out\u2019 . WSP have toured pretty consistently over the years (until recently) while Phish took some breaks. WSP also had to deal with the death of a founding band member and continued on. Dave Schools has always captivated me with his style. WSP are from the south so I got to see them alot more over the years. Sooooo -I vote for Widespread :)BUT they are both talented, creative, and great bands who stretch the bounds of music their way. With any jam band\u2026. you can\u2019t really judge until you see \u2018em live and decide what you like better. It kind of depends on what vibe you are looking for at the show and go with an open mind either way! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to be rather general here, there is overlap in how these bands approach their jamming. Phish is tight as hell and riff oriented. They energize their audience with bursts of dazzling musicianship that intensify their jams. The music gets more intense, more intense and when you think they\u2019ve topped out they hit you one more time with more power than you ever anticipated. Phish is very good at this, which is why they\u2019re so popular. Widespread is looser and groove oriented. They build their jams layer by layer and arrive at a high level of intensity almost before you realize it. The journey to the top of a build is more gradual than it is with Trey and the boys, but they get there. Rather than overtly dazzling you with their chops, Widespread sneaks up on you and what started as a laid back ethereal excursion often becomes a wave that finds you riding surprisingly high. So it depends on what you want from your jams. Tight execution and bold intensity? Phish. Swingin\u2019 grooves with an enjoyably loose feel? Widespread. ",
