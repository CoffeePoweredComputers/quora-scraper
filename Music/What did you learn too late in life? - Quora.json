Few months ago ,something happened in my life,which i would not have ever imagined . on those days whoever came to me ,i considered all of them as my enemies,like they are not with me or they can\u2019t feel what i feel. i was not able too understand what actually my friends are telling too me . i used to be just soo confident that i am right and you all are fool,you can\u2019t just understand .In short my behaviour tends to be exponentially down,no emotions left ,no understanding left for my well wishers . soo what i actually learned that just try to understand people what they want us to understood although if you are in anger or u are not in that mood ,just take deep breathe close your eyes,and then talk . otherwise you will only left with one choice :REGRET ",
