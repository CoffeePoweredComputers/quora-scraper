            "answer_text": "A few things to balance out Jaidev's answer from a pro-Portnoy perspective:  Tensions were one part, but the decline in musical innovation and inventiveness was another. Black Clouds & Silver Linings was rightly panned by some.A logical result of the above, although Portnoy wasn't personally burnt out, or even as a drummer. He is the very definition of a working musician, only ever stopping for short family vacations. Things just need to remain interesting, and this is where the other four members started to fail him. Mike did the A7X album and tour leg as a personal favor. I know the rumor mill alleges that he enjoyed it so much that he wanted to remain with A7X, but that's complete BS. If you pay attention you will find that Mike gives his all on all of his projects and is never intentionally a party pooper, ever. The real issue here is that all he wanted was for Dream Theater, his creation, to adopt a model that's proven very successful for other prominent rock groups such as Phish, The Rolling Stones, Blur, The Eagles, Anthrax, etc.. All have managed to adopt a model whereby they collaborate every few years and take care of their other creative needs in between. Also, recall that Portnoy only wanted to do this once, not forever.Portnoy left of his own accord. At least him and the Johns are lifelong friends, not mortal enemies.As indicated elsewhere in my posts on DT, Mike was the least greedy and the most compassionate. Dream Theater was his baby, his creation. Having battled with his conscience for months, he offered to relent and do the next cycle in spite of his reservations and concerns. Things get a bit murky here, but suffice to say that Solomon's (management)'s lawyers probably put in a veto at this point.Your forgot his guest appearances, Bonzo bash gigs, Flying Colors and Adrenaline Mob, just to name the most well known. In the last four years, Mike Portnoy has released many times the amount that his former colleagues have, and of much better quality at that.I'd say history has vindicated Mike Portnoy. If you can't see that yet, just wait and see. ",

            "answer_text": "He and the remaining band members gave several interviews after the news broke, and while a lot of things were said, the gist of the matter is as follows.  Portnoy said that DT had been on an endless Write-Record-Tour cycle for 25 years. This had taken its toll on interpersonal relationships. Tensions between the band members were high. One unnamed band member would not interact with the rest of them, even when on tour.Portnoy, who was the unofficial \"manager\" of the band, as he used to do a lot of the logistical work like creating setlists, booking etc, was especially burned out. Prior to the recording of their next studio album, later known as A Dramatic Turn of Events, he expressed his displeasure at the state of affairs. He proposed that the band go on hiatus, maybe for as long as 5 years, so that everyone could recharge.The other band members did not agree with this proposed course of action, and wanted to continue as before. They felt that his reasoning was disingenuous, as he was just coming off a tour with Avenged Sevenfold, filling in for deceased drummer, the Rev, which he would not have done if he were truly as burned out as he said.Portnoy stated that he could not continue in the band under the current circumstances. The other band members decided to carry on without him. They fired him and started writing material for the next album, and then searched for a new drummer, the auditions for which can be seen in the 3 part Documentary, The Spirit Carries On.Some time during this process, Portnoy, presumably hurting in the heart and/or the bank balance, made overtures to rejoin the band. He was rebuffed. The band responded to rumours about this by saying that they had chosen to move on rather than dwell on the past.DT have continued to release 2 further albums with new drummer Mike Mangini. Portnoy finished his tour with A7X, did some touring with HAIL! and Transatlantic and has now released music with The Winery Dogs.",
