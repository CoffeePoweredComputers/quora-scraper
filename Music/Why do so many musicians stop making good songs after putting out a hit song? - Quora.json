            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s always true. With the exception of hit factories, like Motown, it can be hard to pick a hit song. Do you know how many times a record label wanted a song removed from an album, and that became that artists greatest hit? Do you know how many times a artist wrote really great music, only to have the one album filler throwaway track be the smash hit? Some formulas work, or used to, like purposely writing a quirky song a la Ray Stevens or \u201cWeird\u201d Al Yankovic, or in the 80s the hair bands would release two regular rock songs and then release a ballad as the third album release and it usually worked. Sometimes you can go the rest of your career without a hit even writing really good music. It\u2019s a crapshoot. ",
