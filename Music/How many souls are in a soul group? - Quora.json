            "answer_text": "As there are 12 zodiac signs, 12 Chinese animal signs, 12 months in a year, 12 pillars of knowledge that has been ascribed by the so called 2nd Adam on the Garden of Eden (mythological) to Eve and 1st Adam (first demigod prototypes), then souls are assigned in 12 groups or tribes. Within a group, 7 of which are the prime and rest are the subprimes. The interaction of groups are controlled and subdivided by a system known as the \u201cintelligence\" and the way they are distributed depends on a system generated by binary bits and quantum field, prior to molecular configuration. The 13th pillar is the selected few souls that run the intergalactic coherence and stabilized the system. Some called them gods, angels, demons, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody knows, so it depends on who you ask. My personal understanding is that within entities of about 1,000 souls, there are several distinctive constellation patterns \u2014 quadrates, groups of seven, maybe others as well \u2014 members of which are not always incarnate simultaneously, but all members of such a group are always working at some level on the same general project.
