            "answer_text": "I'm actually not a negative person but I love an air of mystery, and a hint of something mystical. I love darkness (not to be confused with evil). Horror movies disappoint me regularly because I watch them looking for something imaginative, and quite often they're the least imaginatively written stories. Still there are things in them I enjoy. In the horror movies of the seventies and eighties there were two staple scenes I always looked forward to; one was the scene of foreshadowing, in which the danger or spookiness was alluded to, usually in the form of some mysterious omen presenting itself, accompanied by eldritch music, and the other was the mystical floating nightgown scene. Quite often in these movies a woman would find herself alone at night and be woken by a strange noise, and grasping a handy candle by the bed she would go to investigate dressed in a white nightgown that was so fluid and ethereal, it almost resembled the robe of a druid. Usually this scene is the prelude to the woman falling into real danger but for me it always looked like she was having some sort of mystical epiphany! Was there ever a more powerful symbol of courage than a woman investigating a noise, alone at night, dressed only in a spidersilk garment, and armed with but a candle? For me THAT is a feminist symbol.  ",

            "answer_text": "I consider true, good horror movies to be art. And probably one of the most difficult genres to get right. Anyone could make a movie with stupid partying teenagers in a creepy setting getting picked off one by one by a deranged killer and add a bunch of jumpscares. Those movies are usually trash, but entertaining. But I believe good horror movies should have decent and believable characters, a touch of emotional human drama, some genuine scares as well as being psychologically chilling. Does that sound like a cheap hack job? No. To quote the main character, the writer, from Stephen King\u2019s \u2018Salem\u2019s Lot\u2019 who got crap for writing horror fiction: \u201cI think complex and interesting characters can elevate any genre.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt this character is self-inserted King himself.. The way I interpret that quote is that if you have good characters that people care about with an interesting story, you\u2019re way more open to the idea of some unspeakable, nameless evil trying to kill them.
