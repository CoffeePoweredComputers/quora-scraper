            "answer_text": "The real question is: why would you want to? Singing lessons to improve your ability? Understanding your instrument, how to control it, how to make it work better? Wouldn\u2019t you want to learn something as important as that? I\u2019m amazed at how many people there are who believe that being good is not as impressive as being good without doing any work. If singing was something that I wanted to do (which it is), and wanted to do well (ditto), and I wanted to make a career out of singing and performing (yeah, that too), and I realized that I was not making progress on my own (oh hell yeah, been there), I would do whatever I could, whatever it took to become \u2018better at singing\u2019, as you say. In fact, just asking this question, and receiving these answers, you are now unable to say that you trained your singing without any help. The mini-lessons you\u2019ve received - solfege, learn by rote, record yourself to develop an objective ear - could point you in the right direction and eventually help you realize that an organized plan might be what you need. It seems as though your question to Quora could\u2019ve read: \u201cCould you please help me to be a better singer, so I can say that nobody helped me?\u201d Many singers develop on their own, but they all reach a point when they need advice or guidance to proceed further. You sing well; what next? you sing in church, at school, on street corners, in your garage - then what? find a band? find a DJ? become a DJ? how? sing at school dances, clubs, concert halls? how? record a video, a demo? how? what will you sing? how will you find songs? will you write your own? how? will you find a writing/ recording/ producing partner/team? HOW? No one - no one - goes from point zero to superstardom with absolutely no help. Get used to admitting that you don\u2019t know it all, and ask for help. Ask early, because help costs a lot less sooner than later\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The value of lessons is in the personal guidance and feedback you will receive. Without lessons of any kind, you will need to start with good vocal health, excellent hearing and be very well book read on the science of the voice and the physics of making sound, vocal technique and pedagogy specific to the vocal instrument for the genre(s) you want to sing, as the terminology can differ between classical and popular styles, and there is a lot of information out there. You will also need some luck in determining the correct information, as there is a lot of incorrect technique and advice floating around on the Internet, including YouTube. If you don\u2019t know which teachers to follow for both information and quality demonstration, you might not be able to tell which great sounding singing is healthy and which is not, because there is a lot of great sounding singing to the untrained ear, but a trained singer knows what is healthy. They can feel it in their own voice. However, a good teacher can also hear it in others\u2019 voices. That is expertise that you won\u2019t have without lessons. Because singing lessons can be very cost-prohibitive, I would recommend saving your money for a really good teacher. Get a few in-person lessons when they can squeeze you into their schedule. If you can do a month or two of weekly lessons and you practice faithfully, that should get you started, and then you can request longer gaps for lessons. With infrequent lessons, you won\u2019t progress as quickly, and some teachers don\u2019t have the bandwidth to handle inconsistent student schedules, but if you are flexible and will take whatever timeslot you can get, perhaps they can contact you when they have an opening and you can at least get evaluated periodically to see if you have anything specific that needs work. Of course, regular lessons are really preferred to continue progress, but once you have reached a certain point and can correct your own vocal issues for the most part, you can have less frequent lessons and still manage to maintain slight progress, or at least not reintroducing old habits, if you continue regular practice. In the meantime, don\u2019t do things that do obvious damage to the voice. Don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t yell, get enough sleep and fluids, and avoid anything that feels like strain. Of course you may not know what strain and tension are hiding in your voice without lessons, but at least avoid the obvious. Nothing should hurt, and while some minor fatigue may be normal since you are training muscles, it shouldn\u2019t go beyond that. If you\u2019re tired vocally, rest and try again when it is better. Listen to examples in YouTube of singers and teachers demonstrating the differences between supported, resonant tone, and strained, pushed notes. There\u2019s a lot to be learned there, but without a teacher\u2019s support, there is no sure way to prevent building poor habits on your own. If you have friends who are voice students who can hear you live, they may be able to give you some feedback. Even if they are not qualified to teach, but there is no guarantee that they have been trained correctly, either, which is why they are students and not teachers. There are also teachers that weren\u2019t correctly trained that you may improve with but only to a limited point. If you\u2019re not trained, you may not know the difference. Don\u2019t rule out lessons, if you really want to sing, even for yourself. Save up and prioritize as you can. Make friends who sing, so you can get started with basic pitch matching and rhythm. Learn to keep your voice even. Focus on dynamics. Do a lot of listening to high quality vocals to train your ears, and try to be very aware when you are vocalizing or singing, or even speaking, so you can build your ability to sense vocal changes. Those who do take lessons will take months or years to learn these things with guidance, in small doses. You may be behind them if you can\u2019t take lessons, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t eventually get there if you can get lessons later in life. In the meantime, study well and then practice carefully. I have made recommendations in other posts for singing teachers that I have seen in YouTube who have good teaching and demonstrative skills, and some websites that are very informational and accurate. I\u2019ll include them again here by name, and you can look them up or check other singing related questions on Quora, starting with the Topic FAQ. Justin Stoney, New York Vocal Coaching / Voice Lessons to the WorldKimberley Smith, Inspired to SingKaryn O\u2019Connor, Singwise There are others who are good as far as accuracy and demonstration, but these are my preferred online references, as they are clear, concise, personable, and excellent at demonstration as well.

Really cognizance on the sound of your voice. A commonplace motive for failure to sing on key is genuinely a lack of concentration. Do now not anticipate immediate results. Avoid excessive expectations and any self-grievance or judgment. This will only deter your progress. Remember to use right breath support. One motive of making a song a note or phrase 'flat' is loss of energy which comes from inadequate air upon inhalation. So before you sing that first notice be sure to 'tank up\" with lots of air completed from the diaphragm. (Belly Breathing.) And now you are equipped to learn the secret to top making a song. You can pay attention it inside the sound of your voice and feel it on your throat whilst it happens. The muscles aggravating and your vocal tone sounds pinched and shrill.

Sure, you can lower the key or certainly no longer encompass certain songs in your repertoire. However, there may be a hidden reason why you pressure whilst singing and because you don\u2019t recognise what it is, you need to blame it on other things.

            "answer_text": "It sounds well on its way. I'd be careful not to breathe in the middle of a phrase, which I think I heard you do. Also, try it with an accompaniment for better sense of the harmonies. The intonation is mostly where it needs to be, but not quite. I wrote this next bit before listening to your clip, but this is the advice I would give for someone who wanted to do something more in the classical vein, but it probably still applies; I once heard Helmut Lotti say pretty much the same to describe how he takes care of his voice. Learn to read music if you don't already. Also, if you can play keyboard, so much the better, because it will help you learn songs. Try to have access to one.Take proper care of yourself: get enough sleep, drink lots of water, keep alcohol to a minimum, and don't smoke.Facebook can actually be a great source of information. It has groups that discuss singing technique.Keep yourself physically fit. Also, keep stress to a minimum. A good music teacher will offer end up being part therapist, so the less you need one of those as well, the better. And stay in touch with your emotions.Have good posture, preferably at most times so you don't have to think about that aspect of it too havrd while you singing.If you don't already have one, get a public library card. The library night have books on the subject that you can borrow. (I actually have a copy of Singing for Dummies, and it's not bad.) And they might also have DVDs you can watch, e-books you can borrow, etcThere are also helpful YouTube videos. Some are lessons, but there are also masterclass where singers give what that think are they're just polished performances and more famous and experienced singers tear their singing apart and put it before together in new and wondrous ways.There are also magazines that discuss vocal technique, and some of them have websites. One it my favorites was Voice Council, but they've stopped publication, but I believe they still have an archive up.If you've read up on the subject and watched video, you will have come across various warmups. Have a selection of those that you do every day, preferably not first thing in the morning.When working on rep, make audio and video recordings. The audio will be merciless but it will let you hear what you need to work on. The video will show you what you're doing. If you make funny movements that affect your sound, video will allow you to correct them.A former teacher once ordered the following advice on vocal technique in a nutshell: from the shoulders down, genius! From the shoulders up, dummy! In other words, everything happening in the head it because should feel effortless. Any effort should be happening below the shoulders. And if you hurt anywhere, for heaven's sake, stop and rest. If that doesn't work to make it stop hurting, stop for the day.My personal favorite warmup is to sing overtones on a fundamental pitch in my middle register, which helps me concentrate my tone. FWIW. Something like this: Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are free online tutorials, - but using them is nothing like a real, live teacher who can respond to your sound and habits. So on your limited budget the best thing is to find the best teacher you can, and take a few lessons, or lessons \u201cfew and far between,\u201d as you can afford it. There\u2019s no substitute for a live teacher. Also, there is a lot of print material. Probably the best book on singing, if you\u2019re academically oriented, is Richard Miller\u2019s The Structure of Singing. Check it out from your local library; it\u2019s expensive. Use Interlibrary Loan if necessary. Again, Get an experienced teacher who has academic credentials. Until then, see the practice ideas below. Good luck! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ABCs of Singing There\u2019s an easy way to think about voice culture: the ABCs of Singing. The same things apply to the speaking voice. A is for Alignment. For singing, stand with feet a few cm. apart, NOT exactly parallel, with weight slightly forward on the balls of the feet. Feel a sense of energy in your feet and legs. Keep knees flexible, not tight. Raise your hands far, far above your head, and then allow them to descend and rest easily at your sides. Let your back be straight. Imagine there is a silver thread from the base of your spine out the top of your head that allows your body to float up, up, up. Allow the ribs to expand like an opening umbrella. It is never static or tight, but flexible and dynamic. As you practice, come back to these points, and refresh your alignment/posture. B is for Breathing. Exercise: \u201cBreathe through a straw,\u201d inhale through puckered lips. Immediately hiss out LOUDLY, with great energy from the middle of the body (abdominal area). Feel how this increases energy in the breath. Maintain alignment - don\u2019t allow the upper body to collapse as you exhale. Return to this exercise a few times as you practice. As you sing, breathe LOW in the body, and imagine you have a tire inner tube around your middle; fill it up and lean into it. Always think \u201cup.\u201d C is for Coordination. Importantly, as you go higher, let the voice get lighter and brighter - don\u2019t use a lot of pressure. But, allow the ribs to rise a little, and allow the energy from the middle of the body to increase a little. Don\u2019t yell or scream - instead, slightly increase breath energy and expand your posture to make the sound a little higher or louder. Exercise: easily repeat one note with a breath between then sustain and crescendo diminuendo - get louder and softer [ a, a, a, a\u2014\u2014\u2014- ] . Repeat the exercise on different vowels and higher note, several times. As you go higher, let the voice feel lighter and brighter.This is a very basic start. To really improve your singing voice, get a teacher with academic credentials in voice teaching. ",

I do sing full-time (jazz mostly, between restaurants and events. I\u2019ll never be famous, but I do think I will work as long as I can). I did have some lessons in college as a theater major, but I never thought I would be a singer because of my looks. It wasn\u2019t till someone pointed out how certain music worked with my voice and hired me that I found I could make money as a jazz singer. I started out busking and worked my way to a place of financial security\u2026 kind of. You never know with this job, but I\u2019m seven years in and have not had a \u201creal\u201d job in all that time. I had always listened to certain artists and some of their style rubbed off, though not their exact phrasing, but I committed to jazz and listened to as many great women as I could, played around with what I liked about their interpretation, what I might do differently. I think a lot of it was instinct or just a history of growing up with them in my ears, but a lot of it was just playing with it, song-by-song, taking each and trying to see it as a something I wanted to communicate the meaning of. So, whatever genre you want to sing in, find the best straight up, disciplined vocalists in that genre (just speaking as a woman, I see the best as Ella Fitzgerald for Jazz vocals, Edith Piaf for raw emotion, Anne Wilson for Rock, Anita Baker for Soul, I could go on forever as there are so many greats) and listen to what the way they caress a note or a phrase and play with your own interpretation ",

My heart was broken. However I was given the opportunity to try out at a later point. I decided that I would try out again, and that I would make it. Now what I did was I practiced! I was singing all the time. And by all the time I mean I was told to shut up frequently. I would say the number one thing is to just sing, and to try and be aware of how you sound. For me this was pressing down on one ear, because it helped me hear myself. I still do that when I\u2019m a little uncertain of a note. Another way is to record yourself, and listen. That way you can pinpoint what sounds wrong and try to fix it. Number two, is learn how to correctly sing vowels, because that can really change how you sound. Number three, is learn how to correctly breathe. That will also do wonders for you! You don\u2019t want to breath shallow breathes ( you can tell if they\u2019re shallow by if your chest is rising and falling), take deep breathes that can support you as you sing. You can tell if you\u2019re doing this by if your stomach is inflating with your breathes. Number four, correct singing posture. Just trust me on this, look it up they can probably explain it better then me. Number five, learn music theory and how to sightread sheet music. It really just helps. Anyways hope this helped! Oh and by the way when I tried out for the choir I made it! ",

            "answer_text": "I have answered this sort of question endless times in my other answers related to singing: Rather than try to mis-merge questions, I will just recommend that you read the other answers. The main point to remember is that you can learn a limited amount of basic breathing technique, vocal pedagogy, and lots about the science of the voice, without a teacher: What a teacher will bring you is their trained ears and ability to help you identify and become aware of what you are doing with your voice: A lot of times there are issues because you are trying too hard: The best singing comes without strain, without pushing, without clenching: It's a matter of many vocal coordinations, and only some of that can be learned by mimicking; moreover, you can build incorrect and poor vocal habits that will cause your formal singing training to have to take longer to undo. Learn the breathing and basics of vocal pedagogy and science behind the voice: Watch recommended videos from proven vocal coaches. The only one I've found that matches my teacher's training is Justin Stoney: My teacher is a mentor for an international organization who does lectures and training for other vocal teachers, and she is still open to learning and improving even further from other mentors and vocal coaches: She trains also, but with someone else's superpower ears. Aim for breathing technique, steady airflow, and correct posture, relaxing the body, head, neck, shoulders, know how to relax your larynx, and know how to shape your tongue and lips: You will need to be able to reasonably match pitch, but accurate pitch and vibrato will come with correct singing technique: You should never try to force anything with singing: If you're supporting your voice, it will come up properly: Most issues with singing are corrected with proper technique and regular practice of that proper technique: If you are serious about singing, figure out how you can get a really good coach: If you can't afford regular lessons, at least see if you can pay for a couple of lessons so they can evaluate you, and give you a starting point: From there you can practice on your own with that knowledge and go back after some time, to see what you can do better next: The difficulty there is that it depends on where you are at vocally: It takes a lot of time to become aware of certain things, if you are not with a teacher and you can't identify it right away, or can't remember the sensation after the lesson is over, you may be in trouble: Be extra focused, make sure the lesson is professionally recorded, and practice with that lesson: Listen to the differences that the teacher indicates, and correlate that with your bodily sensations: You have to become on heightened alert, and train your ears, your muscles, and your memory. Edited to add another vocal coach that seems to provide good, explanatory lessons that seems correct so far as I have seen: Kimberley Smith on This answer is from: How Can I Improve Singing Without A Vocal Coach? If you\u2019re trying to really make something out of your voice (whether for fun or to make a living) there\u2019s a difference in learning properly and getting random tips scattered around the internet. That difference is generally friends and family smiling faintly and people actually WANTING to hear you sing.

            "answer_text": "Hi! I am a 25 years old singer and I have had singing lessons since I was 15, so I have a few things to share that might be helpful to you: keep practicing! do it anywhere, all the time.before you start singing, do some stretches and yawns.be kind to yourself, don't push it too hardif it hurts, you\u2019re doing something wrongif you feel too much pressure in your throat, it\u2019s wrong.if it makes you feel tired, vocally, you\u2019re doing something wrong.do breathing exercisesdo tongue exercises, like licking you teeth ten times from side to side, then the other side, etc\u2026put your whole body into it, but relax your neck, lips e tongue as much as you can.listen! if you're flat or out of tune it\u2019s because you\u2019re not listening in your head before you sing. don\u2019t rush it, give it time so you know exactly what note or melody to sing.listen! you know if you like what you're doing by listening to yourself. you can record yourself, just try to not be so judgmental. If it was someone else, someone you like a lot, what would you say to that person to make their singing better?listen to singers that you like, specially those who can still sing after old age. It means they have technique and are not just shouting or being well edited after.pay attention to the sound of your voice while you talk. That\u2019s more or less how your voice should sound when you sing. Although imitating other singers can work sometimes, don't try to be someone you're not. Be the best version of yourself, instead of being a worse version of someone else.you can always watch masterclasses from great people at youtube.singing must feel good, it\u2019s like massaging you're interior with music. If it makes you feel bad about yourself or bad in anyway, you're doing it wrong.Keep singing, don't give up! Best wishes.",

            "answer_text": "Learn to play a guitar, piano or another instrument to accompany your singing. An well tuned instrument when played will serve as a guide for your ear and will allow you to home in on notes more accurately. You will also be able to extend your range by playing notes just above (or below it) and allowing your voice to start getting used to those registers. Guitar and piano are simple instruments and you don't need lessons or a lot of practice to get them to usable level where you can enjoy improving your singing. Watch few videos on how to play simple chords and chord progressions and have fun. Of course, if you dislike playing an instrument there's no value in forcing it. Maybe finding somebody who would accompany you is an option. Somebody who's inclined to learn piano or guitar perhaps. When it comes to piano (or guitar) you don't need to make things complicated and just learn few shapes of chords and stick to them for a while. The whole point is to improve your hearing. You don't improve your voice separately to your hearing. In fact, if you couldn't hear your voice you couldn't sing a melody at all. The brain helps you guide your voice by listening to it. ",

Choose the kind of music you wish to sing. 2.Read a little about it, example: The best singers in the field, The best music composers of the kind of music you want to learn, basic structure of the music, and best songs in the genre. Okay! Now this may look tedious, but doesn\u2019t really take more than an hour. 3. Download a lot of songs of the genre of different artists (Keeping in mind all the research you\u2019ve done above). A lot means A LOT! 4. Start Listening to the songs. Listen to one song on a loop or keep shuffling, but make sure you listen to it, and just not hear it. Listen to the way the singer changes his/ her volume, mood, expressions. Listen thoroughly. 5. After you\u2019ve understood the song and feel comfortable singing it. Keep Singing along with the song. This will help you compare yourself and evaluate where you\u2019re going wrong. 6. Use your own mind. Copying someone is not the aim here, so, it is imperative for you to keep understanding and improvising. At first you will literally do no justice to the song, while improvising. But, this is important, this helps you understand what is it that sounded funny or what made your improvisation wrong. 7. Keep Singing\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "EDIT: this has been merged, and most of the answer was targeted to original question details that got lost in the merge. I think you shouldn't label all the vocal teachers in whole Norway as no good based on one opinion of a friend. So really consider taking lessons. Remember that singing is very personal, so what works for your friend may not work for you and vice versa (given that the teaching is professional and based on healthy principles). Personal chemistry with the teacher certainly play a role. Some teachers are good at teaching the very basics to beginners and others are better at fine-tuning more advanced singers who already know the basics. What you can do on your own I suggest reading about voice and vocal technique. Find online sources, buy books or loan from library. The materials often include exercises that you can try and practice. Keep using your voice, sing and practice. Pay attention that you stay elastic and feel no tension or strain. Be your own teacher. Record your sessions and analyse what you like and what you could improve. Physical exercise that activates core muscles and uses breathing, like yoga or pilates, is useful. Better coordination in your body helps, because singing is a physical activity. What you can do online Some online \"learn to sing\" programs may be good, some are waste of money. Even if you pick a good one, you may misunderstand something, because there is nobody checking if you do the things right. For example there is often confusion between good body connection (what some call support) and pushing, and the latter can do damage. I think they may be more useful after some lessons when you already have some understanding and experience of the technical concepts. I recommend online lessons with a teacher as a second best option after live lessons. There are teachers who offer those. I have had Skype lessons with my teacher when either one was out of town/country and it worked ok. However, meeting a teacher live is still better. Especially for beginners it's sometimes easier to correct things when you can use your hands. Singing involves some core muscles you may not be so well aware of. Finding a right teacher You may need to try several teachers before you find the one that's right for you at your current phase. Some teachers offer the first trial lesson for a bit reduced price, so you can both see if it's a good match. If you don't notice any positive difference after a few lessons, it's time to move on. Don't fall for compliments, look for instruction HOW you improve something that needs work. A good teacher helps you to help yourself, so that you know what to work on when you do it on your own and how to practice. That is important if you can't take regular lessons. ",

Also his analogy is very poor considering there are no exams in order to officially be recognized as a singer by the state. Not to mention other things like required schooling. Seriously, it's a very bad analogy. Also, here is one of the most famous vocalists of our time at age 8 without any prior instruction: Christina Aguilera at 8 I know plenty of incredible singers who have never talked to a private instructor in their life. I, however, would not be where I am without instructors. But everybody is different. People like Greg are lucky to go anywhere with an instructor while others pick up the craft naturally. If you would like to improve the overall tonal quality of your voice, I would suggest picking songs you can sing and just recording yourself and trying new techniques (tongue position, width/height of mouth). A well-developed tone comes from time so just sing and be patient! (Seriously just sing with proper form for 2 hours a day every day and you'll see the improvement in no time). It took me a little over a year since age 17 before my tone started to become bareable. For breath support you can do things like blowing up balloons or blowing into your fist. You can also google excercises like exhaling in small bursts. Breathing Exercises If you have poor pitch and want to improve that then I'm afraid you'll need another person or an piece of equipment (I recommend the software Sing&See). Unfortunately, I don't know your age or what school you attend (if any), so I can't help you too much. If you have a way of joining a choir or acapella group I would definitely recommend that. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are indeed several ways to develop and be taught or learn to sing. I say this :humans have an impeccable ability to hear something is out of pitch or doesnt quite sound pleasing,now whether they can use this ability to train their own voice is where the actual challenge is. If you can talk you can sing. I am a performing recording musicia and i have acheived a professional singing voice without a coach. Heres what i did. I began to sing into a mini recorder while driving or anything where i was mostly alone. I would play the recordings back and say \u201cwhoa buddy i dont like what i hear\u2019 so i began to dissect what i didnt like. I felt i should sing more in pitch so i sang into the recorder every day. One day i started to sing on pitch. Then i felt i needed to have more tone resonating thru me so i practiced singing the words to songs with longer periods of sound than speaking words. Then i didnt like my pronounciation so i tweaked words and sang them different ,then i learned how to vibrate my voice and to change the volume of my voice.. i did this almost every day for about 5 years.. i was already a drummer and keyboardist so i started singing in a band then anothet and then got asked to sing in 7 bands within a year. You can teach yourself. I also coach people how to sing Heres some of my music http://Http://www.reverbnation.com/winnterzkrossing Good luck!! Have fun!! ",

            "answer_text": "You are still quite young and, as you said yourself, your voice is still developing. Be gentle and patient with yourself and your voice while your voice changes or while you adapt to the changes, they are quite dramatic, right? As a young male I can't stress it more, keep exercising the falsetto (the high range that might sound weak and wimpy after your voice dropped). It is an integral part of your voice and must not be relegated to the unused shelf. You can do it by imitating an owl, a train whistle or your grandma calling, \u201c\"Yoo-hoo!\u201d Or something more musical like descending arpeggios (broken chords) starting above the break and coming down. Aside from that, when singing, train your mind to focus on what you are doing, not how. The voice responds to stimuli given it by creating an environment for healthy phonation. Keep these things in mind while singing: pitch (the notes themselves - listen!)vowel (meaning. A, E, I, O, U and all the variations thereof) - is it clear? Is it the one you intended? Listen!Intensity (or volume level) - is it what is asked of you? Are you able to fluctuate easily from loud to soft and back or the other way around (Without pushing)?Musical pattern, or the phrase itself, how do you want to shape it? is it legato (Smooth and connected) or staccato (short, unconnected notes) or a combination? Where is the high point of the phrase etc.These are concepts that are formed before you start singing and held in your mind as you sing. The rest will work itself out and if you are musical and follow where your voice wants to lead you it won't lead you astray. Also, contrary to many, I would urge you not to waste much time on breathing exercises. The flow of air is regulated by the vocal chords themselves and not by the diaphragm or the core muscles As many would have you believe. The diaphragm reaction involuntarily land in direct correlation to the opening and closing of the glottis (the space between the vocal folds). We cannot overtly control it (and anyone who tries to tell you you can is full of - ah, well, they haven't studied anatomy enough). Our only hope on that front is to keep releasing the breath through and by refining our concepts. The best thing you can do is join a choir and sing a lot! Listening to great singers that have had quite a bit of longevity (meaning they sang into old age) and didn't lose their voices will help train your ear and mental concepts. Some recommendations: Pavarotti, Dietrich Fischer-Diskau, Nicolai Gedda, Jussi Bj\u00f6rling. Good luck! ",

Rinse and repeat. Record yourself and critique yourself more!

You can practice all this stuff at home. You just need a computer or smartphone. You can find great stuff on the internet. Here some examples of things that you should practice. Breathing. Proper breathing equal good singing. While you are singing you should use your diaphragm. The diaphragm is an important muscle that helps you breathe in and out. If you want to train this muscle just lay on your back and breath. Laying on your back forces your diaphragm to work.Pitch training. First of all, you have to sing on a good pitch. To improve that skill you can play a scale on a piano and sing single notes. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a piano, you can download a piano app on your mobile device. If you can\u2019t play you can just press random keys and imitate sounds by your voice. That exercise will help you to always hit the right note while you are singing. Listen to yourself and ask yourself a question '' Am I sound right?'Warm up. You can do all that professional vocal warmups exercises like \u2018\u2019lip trills\u2019\u2019 or tongue trills. But you can sing a few of your favorite songs and it will warm you too.

Be patient with yourself, listen to and sing the songs you love to sing, and suit your style, range, etc Listen to artist's that grab you, move you, not just the melody, but the lyrics too, this will help you find your own unique you. Watch the professionals and see how they breath, propell, exentuate, and hold their face. Try singing from your diaframe as oppose to your throat?

Sing the comfortable base notes first instead. This will help you relax and open up the vocal chords.Sing in museum range and top of base notes that are comfortable at first. Over time as you improve your range of base notes you'll find that it opens up your treble notes slowly too.Learn to relax your vocal chords ie swallowing muscles which get tightened when you sing with strain. This strains your vocal chords and give a squeaky feel to your singing esp in the higher notes.Learn to use your diaphragm to inhale and exhale. Consciously at first and then subconsciously as you continue your singing lessons.Practise sustained note singing with a wide open mouth, after slowly warming up your voice.

All well and good, but what if you cannot find one you can work with, or you cannot afford one? Start off by perhaps learning an instrument like guitar or piano. If you can sing along with the guitar piano while you play, it shows that you are in tune which is one of the hardest parts of improving your singing alone. You should practice with the age-old classic, Do Re Me, from The Sound of Music. It\u2019s great for practicing scales, which is one of the main things a vocal coach would work with you on; master Do Re Mi, though, and you are on the right path to stardom. Record yourself; a vocal coach is merely giving you feedback, so record yourself on a good laptop mic or phone mic and listen back. You might shock yourself at your progress! Practice, though, is your best part. A typical vocal coach would have you for 30mins-2 hours every day, so for aim for around 45mins-1hr every day of \u2018\u2019training\u2019 \u2013 the more you exercise and strengthen those vocal chords, the better you\u2019ll be.

            "answer_text": "One of the most important things you can do is to practice things like scales and arpeggios as well as other vocal exercises and techniques such as vibrato and melisma. Although things like scales and arpeggios can be tedious and boring (trust me, I know!), they help tune your musical ear so when you sing actual songs, you are able to hit the notes much more accurately. When practicing for my music exams, the last thing I wanted to do was practice my scales. I just wanted to play the pieces as they were much more enjoyable. But the scales helped me learn different finger patterns that would make the pieces easier to play and sound much more fluid. I understand singing does not require as much coordination but the ability to jump between notes and make it sound pleasant is a hard skill to master whether it be played on an instrument or on your vocal chords. As with any musical techniques, you should start slowly and gradually increase the tempo, making sure to prioritise accuracy over speed to get the technique down. From here, you can start doing variations on the rhythm to better simulate singing a piece of music. For example, a normal scale would be written quaver, quaver, quaver, quaver. You can instead sing: quaver, crotchet, quaver, crotchet or quaver, crotchet, minim, crotchet, quaver, what ever you can come up with. These exercises will gradally improve your vocal ability so singing harder, more technical pieces will become easier and sound better. ",

The world has gone so advanced now that you can easily learn anything you want; you just have to know the right way to do so. It might be possible that you might need a mentor who can guide you the right path but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to go for any lessons. The same is with the idea of improving your singing. You might be good with your voice but then you want to improve it. The good part is, you can do this without the need for vocal lessons. Here are some of the effective ways through which you can observe improvement in your singing: Vocal tutorials on YouTube: The trend has gone digital, so the people too. People these days have got everything they want to see and learn on the videos on YouTube. Even if you want to work on your singing skills, YouTube can help you with that too. Start watching the tutorials based on the singing lessons and you can learn a lot from it and work on your singing skills.Listen to music with earphones on and singing: This is quite a common way to work on your singing, and it\u2019s simple too. You just play any song you know on your mobile phone and plug in the earphones to listen to it. Sing along with the song. The more you keep on practicing like this, the more you\u2019ll go towards the improvement.Sing in front of your friends and family and ask for honest reviews: Sometimes our friends and family can be the best mentor and critic. Sing in front of them and ask them for their honest reviews. Focus on what they point out as your loopholes and start working on it.These are a few effective ways through which you can continue to improve your singing skills, without even spending for the vocal lessons. But for quick and better results, it is always recommended to take the help and supervision of the professionals. ",

I know this might not answer your question, but truthfully learning by yourself is often not the way to go because you might not realize that you are developing bad habits that seem trivial but actually affect your singing. These habits include, but not limited to (since I have these bad habits and at times they still come that I have to consciously tell myself to not do them) poor posture, excessive nasality, singing breathy when going soft, shallow breathing, and others. If you have a good vocal coach, you can immediately correct these habits when he or she spots them while you are singing.  At the same time, do not just believe your friend who told you that vocal coaches in your country are not good. You cannot decide that if you have not tried one for yourself. Besides, your singing goals might be different from your friend's anyway - she just might not find the one that she is looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a simple way that will cost you maybe 200 - 300 dollars. Buy - a large diaphragm microphone, a small mixer with effects built in, isolating headphones (cadh100 $50 or something from vic firth), maybe a Mic stand and digital recorder if you phone doesn't record. You can get these used if on a tight budget. Then sing karaoke off YouTube and record it. Really, if you are honest and not tone deaf, listen to your recordings and see what you are doing wrong. Singing is like anything repetitive, If you do it often enough and are self critical, you will get better. Sing every day or every other day to start and you will see improvement. Karaoke helps because you know what it's supposed to sound like. You may hate your voice. Listen, most people do. Being used to yourself often will give you the confidence to sing. That confidence is 80% of singing well, without it you will sound boxed in and afraid. Be free to let your talent and emotions out of your mouth! Good luck.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is the reply for those: {Who do not want to attend any special type of vocals and music classes {Who want to learn on their own sitting at their home only without paying a single penny to a vocal coach. {Who have got real talent in singing or has passion towards singing or want to make their carrier in Singing. It is the question that is among all the beginners in this field. Speaking from my personal learning experience about learning singing or to improve singing skills is just simple and not too hard. First and foremost, You select some songs (which are your favourite and very much good to practice) and add them into your newly created playlist. Note that you don\u2019t select too many songs at once, otherwise you would get confused and will not be able to concentrate on one. Only 3 to 4 songs would be perfect. Secondly, divide each song on the basis of months or weeks, which means that during whole week or whole month you will practice only that selected song. Now the actual thing comes: What you need to do is listen to that song (from starting till end) and sing along with that song. After that you will came to know that which part you can easily sing and which you struggle the most or just cannot sing that part. Try to adapt the originality like that of the playback singer used in original song. And if you are creative minded then you will develop or modify the song by your own. This will improve your vocal and singing skills drastically. But, remember one thing: \u201cPractice is the key to success for anything upon this world and to become perfectionist.\u201d . . Now I shall share my own experience about this topic. I used to sing a particular song which was my favourite in back 2011-\u201912 repeatedly and discover new things in a similar song many a times. And after few months I mastered in that song and then began to sing different style of songs which I liked and kept those classical style songs away because I didn\u2019t liked it at all. I came to know what kind of songs I can sing easily and with creativeness in it and eliminate those kind of songs which I disliked from the start. Find the uniqueness in the same song which only you can create on this world and no one else can do by their own. Hope all the readers who want to be a good vocalist gets appropriate solution :) ",

BUT, what you hear in songs is rarely what came out of their mouth. Instruction from a qualified vocal teacher will help you understand what the singer is actually doing physically. Where to start. Buy a book on singing - I recommend Mark Baxter's book \u201cRock n Roll Singers Survival Guide\u201d . It says \u201cRock n Roll\u201d in the title but the book is very general to fit any genre of singing. It's a great book on singing using plain language and a little humor. There are also many vocal courses out there that slow you to have lessons at your own pace and in the privacy of your own home. Here's a link to my beginners vocal course that doubles for a warm up routine: Singers & Speakers Course There are others out there from Robert Lunte, Ken Tamplin, Brett Manning but expect to pay way over $100 for them. Mine costs US $35.00. Kevin Richards Singing Lessons Worldwide - RPM Vocal Studios NYC, Kevin Richards ",

If you were not born with the natural talent of being on pitch, you just have to work hard at it. It\u2019s best if you have a tuned piano. Use the piano to familiarize yourself with the tones and try emulating famous nursery rhymes from memory. There are also online pianos if you don\u2019t own a real piano. Once you\u2019ve worked long enough on it, you can move on to singing a song. Don\u2019t think about technique first. Just make sure you get the pitch right. Choose an easy pop song, like Baby, one that doesn\u2019t have a ton of riffs, high notes, or low notes. Then move on to a little more challenging songs. Call Me Maybe is a step up. Make sure you got every note right. After you do simple pop songs, you can try your hand at developing technique by reading 5 Tips on How to Improve Your Singing Voice. Then you can try your hand at more complicated songs. ",

Memorize songs, sing them with and without the tracks, turn the track on at the beginning and at the end to see if your'e still in the same key. 5. Learn some classical pieces, these help you develop a rich tone and well rounded voice.  there is a lot of youtube videos that will tell you basically the same thing, but with some more specifics.

Oh and it would be better if you occasionally record your own voice to mortify your singing. ",

Haven't tried it, but I think copying artists with a similar voice to yours may be helpful.   However, I'd say you should be careful to warm up your voice and make an effort to gradually build up your range. Of course, you listen to someone like Dire Strait's Mark Knopfler and he just stays in a very narrow range and writes songs to suit his voice effortlessly. He also plays kick-ass guitar.  That always helps.  ",

If you haven\u2019t already done so join a good chorus. I don\u2019t know how you can tell if the chorus is good or not, but the director should be giving vocal tips and techniques as she or he directs the chorus in rehearsal. Pay attention to everything that person says and try to practice it on your own at home. Another way to improve is to keep noodling around with your voice at home. Don\u2019t stretch it, just do some simple low range exercises till your throat feels warmed up. Don\u2019t push the top. You can also get actual inexpensive lessons by calling up the music department of your local university. Lots of grad students give lessons. ",
