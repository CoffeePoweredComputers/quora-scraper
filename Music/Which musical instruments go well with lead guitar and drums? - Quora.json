            "answer_text": "Bass guitar - it has to be there to fill the pockets. It is the best friend of the Drum kit.And if needed can also be used to write cool riffs , if a band has only 1 guitar .Rythm Guitar - it can be either Acoustic or Electric . Acoustic will always give a chirpyness to the song, and make it feel earthly.whereas an electric guitar for rythk would just dynamically enhance the sound drastically . just playing itclean on the verses , and adding distortion for the chorus can fill the song in a brilliant way , and allows the lead guitarist to just experiment .if a song doesn't need a full sound , the rythm guitar can also give some harmonies .Keyboard - nothing beats the sound of a piano . But to the average human ear, the piano mode of any keyboard should work fine. Apart from that a tactical use of \u201cstrings\u201d sound , and different \u201cpads\u201d can only add to the ambience of a song.These are the must have instruments . On top of that you can add about any instrument on earth , and they will sound fine, as long as the basic sound is good using the above instruments . ",
