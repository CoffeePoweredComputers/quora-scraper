            "answer_text": "The meaning of the song Hotel California, I believe, is deliberately ambiguous. That being said, there are several possibilities of how the song can be reasonably inferred. The first, and in my opinion the most likely, translation of the lyrics is that the Hotel California is a brothel. Lyrics that allude to the addiction of sex and love can be found throughout the song. \u201cMirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice; and she said, \u2018we are all just prisoners here of our own device.\u2019 In the master\u2019s chambers, they gather for the feast. They stab it with their steely knives but they just can\u2019t kill the beast.\u201d This is to say, all persons in the Hotel California, whether the ladies or the Johns, are enslaved to an insatiable lust that leaves them ever wanting more.The protagonist in the story went to hell. For this alternative, we may consider, \u201cI heard the mission bell.\u201d It was a warning from God not to descend down a wicked, sinful path, or not to open Pandora\u2019s box. He would find himself being led down a dark tunnel, lured by hedonism and camaraderie, that would quickly wear off.The character experienced drug addiction. Most supportive of this theory is, \u201cYou can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.\u201d He can stop using, but he can never kill the desire to use more once he has done so. Moreover, \u201c\u2018Relax\u2019, said the night man, \u2018We are programmed to receive\u2019\u201d, which precedes it, suggests that there is an entity within this addictive force whose interest lies in keeping him there.Whichever of these options you prefer, they are all about a dark addiction that is seemingly alluring, but is in fact an insidious trap that you will soon find you questioning the wisdom of your choices.
