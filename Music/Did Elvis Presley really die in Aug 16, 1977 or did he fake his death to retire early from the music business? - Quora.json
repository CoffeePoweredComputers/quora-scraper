            "answer_text": "He faked his death. It\u2019s obvious everyone answering has never looked into the matter and simply assumes such a thing is too crazy to merit consideration. I\u2019m not going to write a book to answer this matter, but I\u2019ll give you some places to start. First, understand that there is a lot of bad information pertaining to this subject. There are many theories that simply don\u2019t hold up, even if they are ultimately correct regarding the \u201cfaked death\u201d aspect. That means you\u2019ll see a lot of different explanations and evidences which are irrelevant. Don\u2019t judge this topic based on them. Second, Linda Hood Sigmon happens to be his primary mouthpiece. He is in hiding, but Linda is in regular contact with him. Her website provides a ton of pertinent information. If you want the real story, she has it. Unfortunately, the website is a bit of a mess. That said, she does not make money from the site \u2014 she has nothing to sell, only the truth to tell. Link: https://lindahoodsigmontruth.com Third, Elvis (now going by Jesse) recorded an album in 2012. This was against his wishes, but he was pressured into doing it. Apparently, he was threatened with exposure by the producer behind the documentary \u201cElvis Found Alive.\u201d In exchange for performing on the album, they agreed to make the documentary crazy enough that it could be questioned. It is mixed with half-truths, so watch it with that in mind. However, if you want to hear the album (and the voice of an aged Elvis), go here: JESSE\u2019S ALBUM OF SONGS RELEASED ON THE CD \u201cELVIS FOUND ALIVE\u201d IN 2012 You can find these tracks on YouTube, as well. For anyone who KNOWS the voice of Elvis, it is clearly his voice. Personally, I can distinguish between him and ANY impersonator \u2014 this voice is not an impersonator, however. In 2002, it seemed Jesse would come out of hiding with the help of Dr. Hinton, his physician. However, the Elvis Presley Estate (corporation) would not allow it. Elvis is worth more alive than dead. Learn more about Hinton here: FOX 8 May 24, 2004 Elvis/Jesse Dr. Hinton update to 2002 report You should also see the special that was hosted by Bill Bixby. Part 1 - Part 2 - Why did Elvis fake his death? First, he was simply tired of living in a cage. He wanted to be a regular person\u2026 at least, for a while.The plan was to make a comeback as a country star. Elvis\u2019 music, in the 70\u2019s, had already taken a country turn. In the 1980 edition of COUNTRY MUSIC MAGAZINE, you\u2019ll see an ad for his return (as \u201cJesse\u201d): 1980 ELVIS Country Music Magazine Jesse\u2019s Comin\u2019There had been a bomb plot to destroy the Lisa Marie plane with Elvis aboard. This was done by the mafia in Las Vegas (Sinatra played a role). Elvis was working with the Feds to rat them out. Because his life was in danger, it was determined that he should lie low \u2014 in this case, that meant faking his death.I won\u2019t go into HOW he faked his death, but I will say the plan wasn\u2019t for him to be found near the toilet. Elvis\u2019 longtime friend, Joe Esposito, said he found him in the bed unresponsive. His story changed a few times after that, however, eventually becoming that he found him on the floor by the toilet. There\u2019s much more evidence than what I\u2019m willing to go into, but maybe this will help you get started. ",

            "answer_text": "Faked it. While visiting Graceland in June 2003 I saw a large man in a light blue jumpsuit in the woods behind the house. He appeared to be hiding from the touring crowd. He very much resembled the great man himself. For reasons that escape me, even to this day, I said nothing. I simply waved and, incredibly, found him waving back. During a 2nd visit in 2009 I saw him again, same jumpsuit (or so it appeared), peering through a window of the \u201cgarage\u201d located close to Lisa Marie\u2019s *swing set (*bullet hole and all) behind the house. Without permission I entered this garage like structure to find an empty container of Blue Bell ice cream, a large table spoon and what appeared to be a foot long Subway sandwich (1/3 consumed). \u201cElvis\u201d had found his way out of the garage (back door still open) and was running full steam ahead (holding up his pants as best he could) toward the trusted woods many yards across the way. Scanning the ground before me I found a pair of sunglasses I reckoned might have been dropped by the running man, or in this case the running Elvis. At first I wasn\u2019t completely sure but upon closer inspection my most profound concerns were confirmed, as on the interior of the glasses was engraved \u201cElvis P\u201d. I still have those sunglasses and wear them daily, rain or shine. If you believe this story, wonderful. I will invite you to visit Elvis at his home in Graceland. He will be there waiting for you. Ladies, don\u2019t forget the beehive black wig. Gentlemen, consider a jumpsuit (of most any fashion) and chrome colored sunglasses (but not mine, of course). ",

Drug habits are not just disastrous to someone\u2019s wallet \u2014 I would know. I didn\u2019t know that man personally, but I figure if you are that successful at what you do you tend to have more pride than most. You won\u2019t be successful without it. I figure that followed him into his personal life. Yes, Elvis was not actually found on the toilet but rather the bathroom floor but even still, having a heart attack trying to take a shit on drugs is not only insanely hard to fake, but impossible. Of all the ways there are to die, I think he could have found a more prideful way of doing so. ",

The day it was announced to the world that he had died,it just didn\u2019t feel like it was true to me. My first thought,even only being 9 at the time,was why? He was only 42,still very young man. And the next thing I thought was why? Because there was nothing wrong with him. Then the bogus enquire picture,that looked like Elvis on the day he married Priscilla. Then the fact he looked thin, 170 lbs,which he was around 250 lbs. at this said time. Just none of the statements about his death add up. No one had the same story as to the day he \u201csupposly\u201d died. Not even the drs. statments either. Now all you have to do is just simply google retired d.e.a. agent Jon Burrows,and then click images at the top of the page,and you can see,an older picture of who I trully feel is Elvis Presley,but much older. Also watch the documentary Elvis Found Alive,where Elvis hiself talks about the whole faked death. And as to the reason behind why he had to. He explains about many death threats against him,and his family. Just like Elvis explained many times,before he sanged the song\u201dwalk a mile in my shoes\u201d. To never judge a man till you\u2019ve walked in his shoes. ",
