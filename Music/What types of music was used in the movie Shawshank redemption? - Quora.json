            "answer_text": "There were several songs of the times (1930's), some Hank Williams (library), the classical music (warden's office), a rock-and-roll riff (entrance of Tommy). The score was very sweeping; I really liked the piece that was played when Andy emerged from the pipe.  His new \"birth\" from a \"river of sh*t\" and that epic piece set the tone for the rest of the movie; knowing that \"hope is a dangerous thing\". I hope this is helpful! ",
