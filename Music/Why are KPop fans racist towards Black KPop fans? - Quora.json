            "answer_text": "Oh my gosh, I feel so bad for them. So, not all K-Pop fans are like that*. Most don't care if someone has a different type of skin color, body type, whatever it is. But, there are always going to be some sort of a group/gang that whitewash people's skin and make fun of people with darker skin or any of those ridiculous things. We're all human and should treat each other equally. I think that people act racist because they want to feel more superior than others, they think they're the perfect person, or they're jealous of people with dark skin and want to make themselves think they are better by putting the other down. To wrap up, each person has their own beauty and nobody deserves to be treated like that. I haven't really heard of K-Pop fans doing it, but you never know. If you're being treated like that, tell someone and don't feel bad to block the person if it's online. Really hope this helps, and hope whoever reads this has a good day! *When I say kpop fans, I'm basically talking about everybody such as, \"Not every person is like that\" I'm not trying to single any fandoms or people out by the way* ",
