            "answer_text": "That is an amazing question. How could you end such an iconic show keeping intact the dignity and respect it OBVIOUSLY deserves. I can think of many ways to do this. However, in my opinion, the most effective way to do this would be to\u2026 HAVE HOMER SIMPSON DIE!!! Ok, that is a huge idea and if not executed correctly, it could bring a dark shadow over the entire series. Although, if executed correctly, it could go down as one of the most shocking and iconic Television Moments in the last decade if not in history. So how could you perform such a critical and bold move? Well, put simply, you would build off the most captivating and well thought out Simpson\u2019s fan theory of the last decade. That Homer Simpson has been in a coma for the last 26 years. Ok, before I go ahead, this is not my theory, I did not create it. A little context, Reddit user \u201cHardtopickaname\u201d once said that Homer Simpson has been in a coma since the April Fool\u2019s Episode of 1993. (6 months after God told Homer he would explain the meaning of life to Homer when he died in 6 months).With everything after this date existing only in Homer Simpson\u2019s imagination. It would explain the many frankly outrageous plots, the constant guest star appearances and the fact that no character has aged. How would you do the episode? It would have to go for at least an hour. That way you could fit everything into it. Because the ending would only be the final scene. Throughout the episode, you want to close the windows and doors, meaning you don\u2019t want to leave any MAJOR plot points unanswered. Lisa would finally confess her love for Milhouse.Sideshow Bob would attempt to kill Bart one last time and die in the process.Mr. Burns would die and Smithers would find a letter confessing Burns\u2019 undying love and admiration for him.And, finally, Seymour proposed to Edna who accepts.Now, for the final scene. The camera pans out to see Homer lying on a bed in a Hospital, in the room are Lisa and Milhouse, Bart, Maggie and Marge. (All their natural ages). (Lisa, 34, Bart and Milhouse, 36, Maggie, 26 and Marge, 61) Then, Homer flat lines. Bart is the first to leave after telling Homer, \u201cI am SO SORRY.\u201d Milhouse and Lisa are next to go, Lisa balling her eyes out, cradled in Milhouse\u2019s arms. Maggie is next after saying \u201cI love you, Daddy.\u201d (Throwback to her first word). Marge is the last to leave, \u201cI wish you could hear the stories I told.\u201d Then, the room is empty, and the credits roll for the FINAL TIME. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd end it with a Halloween special. You could do three stories. The first one can be called Beginning. It can revolve around Maggie. I'd show her growing up, speaking, going to college, getting a job, moving out and getting married, everything. The rest of the family would hardly be in the episode. I wouldn't necessarily make it funny just a whole life. Oh and she'd take Santa's little helper with her, and you can work out what happens to him from the chronology. Hey I didn't say it was going to be a barrel of laughs. The next episode can be called Middle. It'd be set in and around Homer's stomach. He'd be asleep in his hammock sleeping off some beer and dreaming. The world he imagines would be the entire cast of the Simpsons but each with bits of each other in their own place, and their voices would start morphing too. As he gets more drunk the images and story would become more disjointed and bizarre, culminating in him eating the entire town. The final episode, yes you guessed, will be End. I would run the opening credits and when it gets to the family on the couch the camera just stops. The whole episode would be the voice actors talking about their fondest memories through the characters and the requisite flashbacks. I'd make sure it's less familiar moments, rather than rehash old clips and they could make mention of the things that never were. When all the stories have finished I'd zoom the camera up into space to Kodos and Kang. They'd do some awful Statler and Waldorf skit and then blow up the earth and be on their way. The screen would go black, a mournful version of the Itchy and Scratchy theme tune would play slowly and then fin would come up, flicker and disappear and that would be that. ",
