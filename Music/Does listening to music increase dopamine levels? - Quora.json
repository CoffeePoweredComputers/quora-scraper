            "answer_text": "Our brains release dopamine when we experience some type of reward or satisfaction. The most common way for this process to come about is through our sensory input of course. Hearing and Taste are very much alike in that we \u201cconsume\u201d both food and music. I will use the comparison to better clarify my point. Like food, sound has always been a part of our daily lives. Most of it we choose to ignore simply because it\u2019s not relevant to us at the time. Similar to how food differs from country, culture and so on, music, or instrumentally manipulated sound, has evolved over the years to fit our specific tastes and preferences. I like to think there are different dimensions of sense. Taste has its own dimension with the reciprocation being food. Hearing has its own dimension with its reciprocation being sound and music. With this comparison between taste and hearing, we can say that some foods are bland to us, or bitter. Likewise, some music is not our cup of tea, we would even go as far to say that whatever genre we dislike should not even be considered music, though it is (ahem, rock). Nonetheless, the music we do like has a way of attracting us. It\u2019s everything from the meaning we get from it, the combination of instruments, and overall \u201cfeel\u201d of the song. We especially derive a sense of fulfillment from songs that are relatable. For example, listening to a song about heartbreak and loss when you\u2019ve just lost a loved one can have a profound emotional impact because of its relevance to you. The emotions that music instills in us are universal because we all feel them. When you think about it, there is a sense of unity to be derived. Songs speak to us on an almost divine level, because unlike food, music is internalized from our very being. I\u2019ll leave you with a quote from Beethoven. \u201cMusic is the one incorporeal entrance into the higher world of knowledge which comprehends mankind but which mankind cannot comprehend\u201d -Ludwig van Beethoven ",

            "answer_text": "There are tons of research in the internet which indicate that music elevates the dopamine levels in your brain. The addictive effect of music may be attributed to dopamine secretion. The positive correlation between music and dopamine reveals that listening to music will boost your mental wellness. However, if you listen to music excessively, then substantial secretion of dopamine will have an adverse effect which leads to depressive mood. Inverse direction is also valid. If you have a depressive mood you may not taste music at all. ",
