            "answer_text": "Hopefully, the idea presents itself as I move through my day. If it doesn\u2019t, I have a few things I like to do: I\u2019ll often do a free write. That\u2019s when you just blather on about whatever you want using whatever meter or lack thereof you feel like. After a bit, I\u2019ll usually have something I can whittle down into a poignant line or two. The line or two from the free write is the seed that has grown some really truthful songs of mine and will hopefully grow many more. If my free write ends up sounding dumb, I\u2019ll often turn to the wisdom of others and read poetry. I\u2019ll pick a theme, a line, a metaphor, or an image and build my own poem (read: song) based on how the poem has made me feel or what it\u2019s ended up making me think about. This has also resulted in some cool Queen Cabbage songs. If poetry\u2019s not working, I\u2019ll just give it a rest and consume any type of cultural product. I find that if I keep my mind present in the moment, the movie or TV show or YouTube video about sloths will result in thoughts that easily can be worked into a song. If words aren\u2019t the route I seek at any point for whatever reason, I\u2019ll sometimes steal a melody or chord progression, change up the meter, key, harmony, tempo, and/or rhythmic feel, and have a brand new banger in no time. One of my favorite songs to perform is a folk-shuffle reimagining of Brahms\u2019 Requiem from the perspective of a cynical young person (me lol). It\u2019s a fun exercise and can be done with any tune. Just be careful and make sure you either disguise it enough to allow for plausible deniability or use a public-domain piece! I hope this is enough to get you going and writing songs! I\u2019ll update if I think of a whole new one, but these are my go-to ways to get started. If I can\u2019t get going writing chords and melodies and lyrics, I\u2019ll usually just improvise on the guitar for a while or make a noise collage with my tape recorder and Logic. Or I\u2019ll make a dumb silly bleep bloop beat to remind myself, as is often painfully necessary - please don\u2019t take any of this too seriously. Writer\u2019s block is always, always temporary.

            "answer_text": "If you come up with a melody for a song, here\u2019s how to identify the bass notes (and resulting chords and chord progressions) on the fly when playing or improvising a song/melody by ear on the piano. I assume there must be some underlying music theory to explain how and why this process works, but I don\u2019t have the expertise to articulate what that theory is. Anyhow, here is the process I use to play a melody and chords by ear on the piano, and play it in any key to better match the vocal range of any given singer: Identify the melodic note you are about to play on the main down beat of the song and immediately locate and play the bass note at 1, 3 or 5 intervals BELOW the melodic note. Play 1 or 5 for melodic note I, 5 for II, 3 for III, 1 for IV, 5 for V, 3 for VI, 3 for VII. Intervals 2, 4 and 6 are used more often in developmental more dissonant sections of a song.Form chords from notes 1-3-5 or 1\u20135\u20138\u201310 intervals ABOVE each bass note.See more in the diagram and 2-minute video below.
