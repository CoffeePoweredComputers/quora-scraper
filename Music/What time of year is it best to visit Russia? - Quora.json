            "answer_text": "I visited Russia once during the month of February and a second time during May, and got to experience two different places under two different weather conditons . Both were port cities and were short stays but just enough to get a good enough glimpse of the locality. Vanino : Vanino is one of the busiest port cities of Russia and is at the easternmost part of Russia. This was a surreal experience for me cos it was the first time i was experiencing snow ! February being the winter season , it was all white everywhere, yes snow-white :)  The sea itself was a thick sheet of ice  and once we docked , it wasnt easy to demarcate the lines between the sea and the land. It was all a continous sheet of ice all around. This pic below shows our ship\u2019s frozen-up anchor :   The entire vessel was clothed in ice. It was a sight to behold. Walking on the ice was tricky ; i slipped down a couple of times . Its difficult to get a grip while walking and all it takes is one small careless step and you are down in the dumps :D  I really enjoyed the sights and sounds and smells of Vanino and was delighted to take it all in at my own pace.  The food was awesome, suited the weather and suited my taste buds too.  Overall an amazing and unforgettable experience. To be cherished forever.  Nakhodka : This is yet another port city in Russia and i happened to visit this place around the month of May, when all the snow had just about cleared but still pretty cold out there. The food and culture pretty much similar to Vanino and hence i loved it. Below, a snapshot of what the meal looked like :  There was a beautiful and splendid looking old church just atop a hill right next to the port where our vessel had docked. And i could see the beauty of it right from where i stood on the ship bridge . This pic below shows exactly how it looked from atop the vessel :  Made me want to go there atleast once and i felt so lucky when i finally got the chance to travel up there and see the church , walking all around its green landscaped lawns and surreal flower gardens.    Oh i loved it. It was pure bliss just being there. So much oeace, so much tranquility, lovely weather, a truly divine experience !!! The pic below is a street view :  I would love it if i got another chance to travel to Russia and i dont mind whatever season it is. Sailing the 7 seas ",

            "answer_text": "I think any time of the year, well except January and February due to the extreme temperatures, are great for visiting Russia. There are pros and cons to visiting during each season, during the winter you can experience it in all it\u2019s glory with the streets and landscapes covered in snow, but it can get a bit cold so be prepared for that. During spring and summer you have the convenience that it is sunny a big portion of the day, but it can get a bit hot at certain times. If you want to experience snowy Russia, I recommend the beginning of December, because it isn\u2019t that cold yet, but ther is already snow and the rivers are frozen. If you want warm and sunny Russia, visit during June/July, but don\u2019t forget to bring sunblock. Something that I can recommend is visiting the same place during different seasons, it really changes your perspective of the town or city that you visit and you get to experience it in a completely different way.
