            "answer_text": "This is a great question with multitudes of answers depending which fence you\u2019re on. Let\u2019s break it down: Music GenreFunding/Education/DevelopmentAre you just starting Vs. established musicianThere are a lot of angles to look at with UK vs USA but lets keep it to the above three for now. Music Genre - My question initially is what sort of music career will you be looking to pursue? Is it hiphop/r&b (USA), is it electronica/house/trance (UK) or is it rock (USA), country (USA) or indie/folk (UK). There\u2019s a bunch of research on this available online but depending on the type of music you play or are into, generally helps make the case whether or not USA or the UK is viable. Certain genres are preferred over the next since music is very polarizing to begin with. If we dig a bit deeper, the USA and UK are large markets so you can choose a niche city as well if either/or doesn\u2019t work for you.Funding/Education/Development - Depending which stage in life you are in, you might need to depend on the music career full time. Certain grants and funds are available in both the USA and UK which you might qualify for - scholarships as well. A bit of research on that, will help out. Certain music associations like ASCAP, SOCAN, BMI and local music associations can help you here. They also help provide insurance options, etc.New Vs. Established - If you\u2019re an established artist, if you have a following, analyze the metrics. See where your followers are or what countries they are attached to. If you\u2019re just starting, you have freedom to be a global musician. Play gigs and see which city or country suits you. Musicians like Linkin Park and Avril Lavigne may have started in North America but they\u2019ve established a remarkable following in Asia which allows them to tour those countries for nearly double or triple what North America pays. Like what I mentioned earlier, music is polarizing and even if you have a home-base, you\u2019d be surprised where you end up.I don\u2019t want to over-simply my reply so if you\u2019d like me to elaborate more, with statistical data, you can reach out to me here.

            "answer_text": "That depends on what sort of music you play, and where you'd rather live. To support yourself by playing live music professionally, you\u2019ll need a paying audience. Where and how could you be the most appealing and draw the biggest audience? Being a foreigner to your scene can be a draw.Setting yourself apart by playing music that is different from the local scene can also be a draw.Already having a bigger audience or fan base in a certain place is an advantage.Playing familiar songs that people already know and love can be an advantage in landing paying gigs.Having a pool of other musicians interested in your kind of music can help you grow as a musician.Being able to play to an affluent audience and live cheaply helps.To make a living as a musician, you may have to also be willing to make concessions in the music that you choose to play. To have a paying audience, people have to be willing to pay to listen to your music. I have two American friends who are both talented musicians. One only plays his own music and never plays covers. An indie musician based in Portland, Oregon, he is struggling to make a living and has to work side jobs. The other friend lives in Nice, France and plays pop covers from various countries to wealthy audiences. He and his wife support themselves on their playing. It seems hardly surprising to me that my indie musician friend\u2014who is trying to set himself apart in a sea of indie musicians and makes no compromises in his repertoire\u2014is struggling. My friend in Nice plays what people want to hear, while also developing his own compositions. While not (yet) wildly successful, he is making a living solely by playing music. One common shred of insight that I\u2019ve heard from almost every career musician is that networking and the ability to work well with others is essential. To go back to the example of my two friends: My Portland indie musician friend is constantly complaining about everyone he plays with, every venue he plays for, and every musician with whom he shares a stage for trivial perceived slights against him. Every band he has ever played in has disintegrated when the other band members leave, leaving him as the last member. My friend in Nice works very well with others and is skilled in resolving conflicts. He takes responsibility for his own failures and has improved rapidly as a musician. It seems hardly surprising to me that my friend in Nice has been most successful. I have a third American friend who is an incredibly driven and capable jazz, soul, indie rock and fill-in-the-genre musician. Of the three, he is the also most musically talented. But he works side jobs, in part because he is based in Pullman, WA and struggles to find an audience for his sophisticated multi-genre music. He avoids playing metal or country, which would help him land gigs more easily in his area. In my opinion, he would benefit from some starting cash to launch the career he deserves in NYC or LA. ",
