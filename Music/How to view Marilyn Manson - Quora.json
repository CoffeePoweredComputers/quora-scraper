            "answer_text": "I do not like much of the band\u2019s music. I do not find Manson\u2019s lyrics deep at all. I have seen too many good lyrics to call it deep and the music-well it\u2019s nothing that leaves me in awe either. (I don\u2019t have problem with the genre, I listen to almost all genres and his music is rather tame compared to some of the stuff I listen to) As for the person MM. Brian Warner. Here goes\u2026 I am an atheist. I have a very low opinion of him, if his book that he published in 1998 -the long, hard way out of hell- is anything to go by. Here are my reasons: He subscribes to social Darwinism, the pseudo-intellectual he is, claiming people have the necessary intelligence -a basis for \u201cequal opportunity\u201d for survival but they do not use it.I agree with the intelligence bit. My problem is with his failure to acknowledge the fact that people aren\u2019t always after the same things, and some refuse to survive in certain ways. An extreme example: Some would rather die than have to kill. Some would quit their jobs than have to suck up and kiss ass. You get my point. He speaks very much like the Eugenics people. A person who commits suicide, to him, is yet another dumb fuck who didn\u2019t deserve to live anyway. So basically, he doesn\u2019t want conflict and clash and the change that comes with it- he is above all an adapter, a survivor. A Machiavellian. 2. We have had atheism deal with religion and religious dogma. Agnosticism, theism, pantheism etc etc. This has been an old and ongoing debate. There\u2019s no place under the Sun that a guy who has used Satanic symbols just to make a point could say, that ages-old debates held in philosophy circles haven\u2019t covered. So why the endorsement of superficially controversial symbols and acts? Because that is what makes him relevant. Why be just another atheist(or whatever) when you can call your work an Antichrist metaphor on mission, and sell the controversy? Being the Antichrist is tangible to die-hard Christians whose numbers diminish by the day, and they are sure to pick up on it. Safe bet is what it is. You are not taking on and down the establishment like an atheist does. You are instead consolidating it by using one of its concepts, no matter how metaphorically you mean it. What I am saying is he is not sincere. He\u2019s been milking it all, and he needs those Christians and this sort of fake in-establishment opposition to milk it all. All those fake affidavits (in the book) just further his agenda. The question is, what is it exactly you have been rebelling against? How have you been going about doing that? Fist-fucking your friends? Peeing on a deaf fan? How many times are you going to do your sexual revolution? Why, like a monkey who has just discovered it has a dick, is it so important for you to make a point of exercising your freedom to make your hand into a fist and than penetrate bodies with it? Why is it not yet another bodily function? How does your hedonism, that you justify as an act to further your allegedly not self-centered cause, help kids understand how religions brainwash societies? How does turning backstage fan torture into a habit help you convey your message across, exactly? Or raining fake stuff in your concerts? Superficial symbolism\u2026 what is it supposed to do if it is to create a state of shock vulnerable to suggestion, rather than sparkle thought the way Roger Waters\u2019 pigs do - (that is if you must use symbols to go with your lyrics) He\u2019s been milking it all. Feeding off of expected behavior-reaction. Shock does not incite thought by itself. Questions do. People started believing in deities because thunders shocked them into bewilderment and feelings of smallness. And again\u2026 what do the different ways with which you use your dick in your concert achieve exactly? Or you sucking someone else? What is the epiphany there? The message? 3. Which brings me to my next point: He is in fact encouraging consumerism by promoting a life-style without putting much thought into it. He is popularizing a series of actions, a certain look, and very shallow jabs at inside-the-box thinking. He is selling a whole template of a shell of a personality, absurd antics that have no meaning, shock for the sake of shock\u2026 4. If you read his book you\u2019ll see how he chose to describe people: Physical appearance, and a lot of dissing based on that. So he wrote the lyrics to Beautiful People but has never been able to walk the talk. 5. Again if you read the book, you will see how he admitted to using people and how he rationalized it with his subjective definitions of usefulness and social Darwinism. He was an addict in denial who despised his addict friends. He was a dependent narcissist who thought it was normal to have a romantic relationship with someone he didn\u2019t like just because was paying his expenses (Teresa). Yet in his book he rambles on about self-control and independence. His use of \u201cconvincing someone to do something\u201d was too recurrent in the book to be neverminded. He had manipulated people and thought it was perfectly normal and well within his rights to. Convince a member to leave another band to join his when the friend was about to record an album, convince someone to give their stuff away, convince someone to set up and financially support poetry nights for him, convince someone to do this and that, the list goes on and on and on. (promote your band in the music fanzine you write without revealing the conflict of interest, pretending to be someone else) He initiated flirts with sex in mind and then made fun of the girls he had sex with. He initiated a friendship with using the friend\u2019s recorder in mind, and then despised the friend. He convinced people to form a band with him, didn\u2019t know how to play a single instrument and whined on and on and belittled someone who he expected was to excel in guitar and another in keyboard. Then he criticized them for not understanding him, what is on his mind. (without acknowledging that there was a band with all amateurs in it who might as well have developed creative differences, speaking about the band as if it was his property and then expecting team work, and musically being the least talented person all the while, not bothering to learn to strike a chord) He had been present in every scene where he despised the acts of his friends, calling them new lows, yet he was silent and complicit in all and you can tell he\u2019s had his fun. He despised this stalker girl he had used as a stage prop(mimicking walking a dog, master-slave bdsm stuff) yet had had sex with her regularly the way fuckbuddies do, to say the least, knowing fully well that it was not just about sex for the girl. He had kept enabling her and then got angry at her for being who he always knew she was. He had received a blowjob from this girl and hated being there and every second of it, and then did it again and again. Then he gloated about self-control. He had almost never exercised it, and yet gloated about it, demeaning others meanwhile. He had used up people, then discarded them and then called them names. The way he explained his behavior, despite the couple of times he called himself dishonest, was all too convenient. 6. That is his problem at the core. He explained away dishonesty saying once you realize your own hypocrisy, just the act of realizing it gets you above it, lets you overcome it. So you can say how brutal a bastard you are as you keep killing: although you\u2019re still a killer, you are now a better killer because you know you are a killer. Knowledge is better even when it doesn\u2019t bring about change. It absolves you of any responsiblity and because it makes you \u201cbetter\u201d by some nominal category, you now have the right to keep doing it as if you never knew any better. 7. Which in turn reveals his lack of guilt in anything he\u2019s done. He outright said it himself but kept at justifying and even defending it, however. He said humanity should be about a guiltless existence. At what costs, he didn\u2019t say. Any limits to that? Didn\u2019t answer that either. It is OK as long as you can get away with it. This is the gist of his character. It is OK as long as you can get away with it, and getting away with things was something that he bragged a lot about in that book. A self-confessed social Darwinist, fancies himself as a modern day Atlas, and then shrugs. Yet like all these Atlases (take the writer Ayn Rand, the Nazies, the Eugenics) who deem themselves superior and shrug, he shrugs off the idea/construct of justice itself. Stupid people, he says, deserve to die. What is the definition of stupid? Those people who do not do what you choose to do? Those who refuse to do what you do? 8. He then talked about how the idea of God can be replaced by other things -he made himself an example- by way of popularity. His argument was that popularity was what made god god, and if he became more popular than God and conquered \u201cthe mainstream\u201d -with the fake alternative he implied being belonging in the mainstream- then he or anything else for that matter would become the new God. One cannot help but wonder: If it is not the dogma itself you are against, what are you against exactly? How is your becoming the new it, another fashion guising as thought, not a dogma in itself? Does popularity pave the way to thought? Why ruffle feathers now, then, for as long as something is popular, it doesn\u2019t matter what is, if that were the case? How is Marilyn Manson any different than the God dogma, or the flying Spaghetti Monster for that matter, if popularity is what makes you relevant as opposed to a critical analysis of your content? As I said earlier, if his book is anything to go by and it is, since he had let that book be published, Bryan Warner is not an intellectual, in addition to the fact that he is a dishonest, opportunistic, self-serving, antisocial (without empathy) person who has manipulated his way through to fame, just like Charles Manson made others kill for himself. He holds in high regard the \u201csuccess\u201d in making others do things for him. He was never in it for the things he claimed he was, it was all personal gain. That is why he\u2019s created this self-sustaining fame cycle where his opposition has only made his career, as opposed to ruining it the way he\u2019s asserted they have. I consider him a nasty person by any standard I know of. I have told you about my reasons to think so, and his book has given more than half of said reasons. ",

            "answer_text": "Marilyn Manson is a genius. A genius in music, politics, and philosophy. A genius in an industry full of morons lacking talent. Marilyn Manson does not simply create good music, but every line contributing to his lyrics are his explicit views on the world he has experienced. He is well-read and well-watched, as evident in his writings and performances. He is my favourite artist and musician. It is unfortunate that for a long time, the world misunderstood him and the message he was trying to share. It seems that has mostly changed. Mostly. I have never disagreed with anything that he has shared (though I may not always wholeheartedly agree either). Plus, he is good friends with Johnny Depp, one of the few people in Hollywood that I actually like. And they occasionally perform on stage together. They are the best duo in the music/Hollywood industry. Furthermore, what many people don\u2019t know about Manson is that he was a journalist and a poet before his rockstar days; and a damn good one too. I recommend listening to his music and reading his book, A Long Hard Road Out of Hell, to know exactly the kind of person Manson is.  Like Willie Wonka, Marilyn Manson is our forbidden hero. He stands for personal freedom. He stands for truth. I\u2019ve always believed that a person is smart. It\u2019s people that are stupid. And few things bear this out better than war, organized religion, bureaucracy and high school, where the majority mercilessly rules. When I looked back at my first days there, all I saw was an insecurity and doubt so overwhelming that a single pimple was capable of throwing my whole life out of balance. Not until my final days did I have self-confidence and self-respect, even a measure of individuality.I knew that Brian Walker was dying. I was given a chance to be reborn, for better or worse, somewhere new. But what I couldn\u2019t figure out was whether high school had corrupted me or enlightened me. Maybe it was both, and corruption and enlightenment were inseparable. - Marilyn Manson, A Long Hard Road Out of Hell ",
