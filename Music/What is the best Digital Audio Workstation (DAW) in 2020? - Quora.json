            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t like studio One, and I would go with a Soundcraft 24 channel multitrack console, and a Mac. I bought a 2012 Mac Mini. I had to modify it to SSD. And I have a 25 year old Tascam M2600 Board 24 channel 8 bus, and it feeds a Behringer Uphoria 8 channel interface. I have some DBX,Yamaha,Korg, etc., outboard gear. For software, I have GarageBand, which is quite useful. Pro Tools because I was able to get an education discount on a perpetual license. I probably would have paid full price. PT 2019 is nice. and Harrison MixBus. This costs a fraction of Pro Tools ( less than $90 ) and does just about everything and with exceptional tonality and accuracy. It also has the EQ compression and limiting built in. I don\u2019t know why ot isn;t more popular. I mostly use it to Master my mixed tracks. You can download Mixbus in minutes, for any machine. I\u2019ve also invested heavily in Waves Plug-ins. They have frequent sales, and have really democratized their pricing schemes. And they make really good stuff. The plugs that come with ProTools are tired, and the ones they make you pay for because they\u2019re good are the same stuff that they were giving away in 2000. And I\u2019m a fan. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow\u2026 That really depends on your work flow. DAWs have gotten really competitive with each other, so there\u2019s a lot of great ones\u2026 As for me, I like Fruity Studio\u2026 Version 9. Really intuitive to use! But newer versions of Fruity have drifted away from what I really liked about version 9. Now you have to go around your ass to get to your elbow. I sat down at a friend\u2019s Pro tools and couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it. My advice\u2026 Try demos of a bunch of different ones. See which one does everything you need, the way you need it to do it. ",
