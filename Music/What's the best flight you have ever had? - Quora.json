            "answer_text": "Best flight is the flight that you arrive alive so pretty much all my flights can be considered as best flight. I have had flights where delta flight attendants have given me handwritten thank you notes for flying in delta  I have also had the pleasure of writing in delta captains log on his last flight before retirement thanking him for his service   I can also mention one more incident which made my day but also made me feel very guilty This was a long haul flight from Atlanta to Seattle, close to 4\u20135 hours and when I checked my seating, I was in a middle seat. Usually, I do get upgraded or seated in Aisle or window but since it's from Atlanta to Seattle it's usually pretty crowded. I went up to the counter, checked if there is any option to move to window or aisle but I was told it was fully sold out and they are looking for volunteers I was resigned to my middle seat and when I scanned my boarding pass, I got a new pass stating that I was in aisle now but same row. I was pretty happy and very appreciative of delta that it took care of me. I settled down in my seat, put my bose headset on and was about to relax with my downloaded Netflix when I saw the passenger next to me pretty agitated and restless. I took a moment to introduce myself and asked him if I can help in anyway and he said - I was in aisle seat like 5 minutes ago and now I am in middle seat and I will never fly in delta again. !! ",

            "answer_text": "The best flight I have ever had was Qatar Airways QR 0725 from Doha to Chicago. It was my first ultra long haul flight with a flight time of 14:30 hours and I was pretty excited for it. I was traveling from Ahmedabad and despite multiple requests did not get a window seat for the Doha-Chicago flight . In Doha I requested a change of seat and was assigned a window seat in the huge Boeing 777\u2013300 ER . It was an all day flight which made it even better . I captured some of the best views that I had never seen in my life .The seats were very comfortable and the IFE was just fabulous with a large choice in movies and TV shows. The meal was one of the best I had on any of my previous flights and I will never forget this memorable flight . DS ",
