            "answer_text": "It\u2019s gradualism. We didn\u2019t go from instruments, singing, and musical notes to people who talk fast about their exploits over samples of better music overnight. The beginning of the end came long before the advent of rap, however. It\u2019s the festering, flaking, pustulating symptom, not the disease. Over half a century ago Tiger Beat demonstrated that the image a musician portrayed mattered more than the music itself. Marketers could drive young girls into a frenzy over substandard music and sell magazines at the same time as long as the singer had goofy hair and nice teeth. I\u2019m not saying that every song before 1965 was a masterpiece. But it sure sounded like they were at least trying. A decisive point in the decline came in the early 1980s. MTV needed popular musicians to make videos. The record labels said, sure, we\u2019ll get Pat Benetar to appear in a video. But we\u2019re pretty sure we can use your cable channel to push acts whose main talents are visual gimmicks, so that\u2019s the package, take it or leave it. Sure enough, audiences couldn\u2019t tell the difference between audio and video, and mistook Hangin\u2019 Tough for decent music because they saw synchronized dancing. Now it\u2019s game whooa-oo-oo-oo-over if all you do is write and perform awesome music but you can\u2019t sell it in a video. In a death-stroke of bad timing, 1981 also saw the release of Frankie Smith\u2019s Double Dutch Bus by WMOT records, which doubled as a money-laundering operation for a cocaine dealing dentist known as \u201cDr. Snow.\u201d It featured the \u201cizzle talk\u201d Snoop Dogg later called his \u2018gift to the world.\u2019 (It was an SNL sketch, he was joking, and it was funny.) Willze illzare plizzayin' dizzouble dizzutch! dizzouble dizzutch! dizzouble dizzutch! When that played on the radio and rather than changing the station or jamming the phone lines to complain, people instead concluded that other people must like it so maybe it\u2019s okay, that was the day the music died. Don\u2019t wait for it to bottom out because it won\u2019t, ever. In sixty more years people will listen to the sound of gravel in a blender and complain that it\u2019s gone downhill from the gravel in a blender a decade earlier. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it obviously goes without saying that taste in music is subjective, so what you think is shit music, someone else loves and vice versa. But, obviously there are some artists who are just not musically talented and hard to listen to, yet they are successful. I think their success has to do with several things.  1. The pop music industry doesn't care about educated adults' taste in music, because they don't buy music. Teens and preteens do. Now I don't know about you, but when I was 12 and 13 begging my mom to buy music for me, I had pretty shit taste. Teens with shit taste and an overwhelming desire to fit in, even if fitting in means loving a shit artist, drive the music industry. 2. Major media corporations run pop music and the mainstream media that promotes it. 3. Most people who make decisions at major labels are middle aged men trying to anticipate what the above mentioned suburban (or sometimes, urban) teens will want to hear. It's a daunting task, so they figure their best bet is to play it safe and use what they *already know* works. Thus, you get a handful of artists that make music with a handful of producers that ends up sounding like the same handful of songs we hear over and over and over again. It doesn't help that the entire industry is scrambling for money and extremely risk adverse because they don't have extra funds to spare on experimental stuff. (The indies do, but that's a different discussion). 4. Teens buy into this because everything else in the mainstream media tells them they should so they can be part of the in-crowd. They buy the music (maybe not the actual music, but stuff the artists are selling) and the other products music is used to promote. Music industry stays afloat, brands are happy, business wins and continues as usual. It becomes a self reinforcing loop. Also the final thing that should be noted is that musical ability is only a small part in being a mainstream pop artist. I would say stage presence and commanding an audience with your personality is the main ingredient. Likeability (in the case of T Swift or Beyonce) or ability to stir controversy and polarization (in the case of Iggy or Kanye) are probably second most important. Finally, people with money have to understand how to market you as a product. Being a good musician is not necessary. PS. if you want a more cynical outlook on the subject, research has shown that the mainstream media industry promotes sex, drugs, violence, misogyny, and racial stereotypes even when the market doesn't demand it. There is probably some answer to your question that considers the notion that owners of mainstream media push for us to be inundated with messages and images that perpetuate separatism, greed, capitalism, nihilism, and apathy. Those in power want to stay in power. It's not unrealistic to believe they would use pop culture as a means to do so. ",
