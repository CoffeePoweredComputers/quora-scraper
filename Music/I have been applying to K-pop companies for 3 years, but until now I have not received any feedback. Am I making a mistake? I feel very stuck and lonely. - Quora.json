            "answer_text": "hey. i\u2019ve seen this question floating across quora for a while now and i just passed it because, well, i thought a lot of people would respond. i guess not. either way, i won't say \u2018thank you for the request!!\u2019 because it just doesn't feel right. you're.. desperate for answers, amirite? not in a bad way of course but in a frustrating way? let me tell you, it's alright to be frustrated sometimes so don't beat yourself up too much <3 anyways to my answer ; let's go back to the basic requirements. are you asian? if it's a yes, ask yourself this ; are you east asian? are you young? are you good, like \u2018wow\u2019 kind of good at dancing, rapping, and/or singing? can you speak korean? ask that to yourself. be honest. i\u2019m not trying to be rude, but it's 2020 and sure, kpop has opened up to people of other nationalities, but.. are they really? the racism that's bound to happen, the hate, the hardships ; you've probably already braced yourself for it. what's sad is, if ever you get accepted, foreigners are bound to be the magnet of international fans. yes, that's a good thing! but what's saddening is, what will other people remember you as? a member of group x or the [nationality] idol? koreans themselves have a hard time getting in, and i doubt that it'll be any easier for foreigners. or maybe, you're auditioning for the wrong companies. there are companies out there who have closed doors when it comes to foreigners, and others who are open to the idea of having foreigner trainees. keep in mind, trainees. the percentage to debuting is so little, and how you'll get fame after debuting and how long that fame would last. think of it. you train for, let's say, two years. you're determined, yes, but will that determination get you anywhere? let's say that you debut. ah, the bittersweet victory battle against your negative thoughts and your optimistic outlook in your career. will you be lucky enough to be noticed by the public? will you have a good relationship with your group mates? will you be lucky enough to be in a decent company, a company that won't use your body in wrong ways just to gain the slightest bit of negative attention? it's hard out there. and this is barely the surface. but, you've come this far. auditioning for three whole years? you're brave, and i salute you for that!! so i say don't give up yet. try to audition for other companies. sharpen your skills. try auditioning for at least six more months, or maybe a year. maybe you just need to try harder. or maybe you just need to realize that you aren't meant to be a kpop idol, and you were meant to be something else. just know that you'll look back at this in the future, and go \u2018it sure must have been a dream to be accepted and debut as an idol, but i\u2019m happy right now. at least i tried.\u2019 remember to feed off that experience. i hope this answered your question, or even, helped things clear up for you! i didn't mean to sound too messy or anything, but you get the point. don't give up too easily, but at the same time, know when to give up. here, have a cha hun (\u00b4\uff61\u2022 \u1d55 \u2022\uff61`)  ",

            "answer_text": "Don't lose hope just yet, although it might seems all just hopeless after 3 years of auditioning for Kpop companies, I think if you are really passionate, there will be a company that will appreciate you and your talent. You just have to keep finding it. If you aren't able to find it now, why would that be a reason you shouldn't keep going. Even if it might be difficult and you will face hurdles, it is not a reason you should just give up. Like all things, finding the right company who will accept you will be difficult, and will have its own set of challenges, but what\u2019s important is that you ultimately reach that goal. despite all of the tribulations and difficulties you have gone through to reach to this point. No one can be able to do this for you that yourself, so you have to make the most of this opportunity to continue searching for the one. You might be unsuccessful, this time, but maybe, in the next year, there will finally be a sliver of hope for you to be accepted, because someone has finally acknowledged your talent, and see potential in you that no one had before. I think just like applying for the auditions love can be similar. You keep looking for the one for you, despite the failed attempts, until you finally land on the one, when you hit the jackpot, ad suddenly, what seemed so bleak, and desolate, have become bright and hopeful, and then, you think what pain, what troubles, what failure, you have finally have a hold of that goal, finally achieve it, and when you look back to everything you have faced, you will only realize that everything that you have gone through, the struggles, and the pain, has all led up to this moment, where you can finally, stand there knowing you have done it, and you now are in this position, that seemed far fetched and distant. Your dream has become a reality, and all those past pains, and struggles are only a distant memory, and when we reminiscence, you will only smile, because you know that those moments were important to help you progress to this stage of your life, and it is not a decline in your progress, but only helped your to move forward and keep going. It was part of your growth, and it was a moment of realization, that you need to do this, you need to surge forward, and a form of motivation, to propel you further into your journey. maybe, you come out at the end battered and bruised, but you feel, rejoiced, you feel alive, and reinvigorated and you jus feel like you have to whole world in the palm of your hands, and you feel like you are just on the top of the world, overlooking the beautiful view in front of view, because you are in complete and pure bliss. So, just keep going no matter what life throws at you, and never give up on some,thing you love to do because regret will only follow you. Just envision that mountain, climb towards it, and reach the top, where you can see the beautiful view. Just imagine yourself climbing up the mountain, to reach the top, so you can finally see what is up there in story for you. Just imagine yourself, up there, and exploring what is up there beyond your vision. ",
