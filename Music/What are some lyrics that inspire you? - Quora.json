When her arms enfold me.  I hear a tender rhapsody.  But in reality, she doesn't even know me.  Just my 'magination, once again.  Running away with me.  Oh, tell you it was just my 'magination,  Running away with me.  I never met her but I can't forget her.  Just my 'magination,  Ooo yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Running away with me. - Just my Imagination by The Temptations  P.S: Will add more.  Source: Song Lyrics from A to Z  ",
