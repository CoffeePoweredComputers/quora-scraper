            "answer_text": "If this is common for you, you may have an unusual type of depression. I do. I would cry and think, \u201cSusan, why are you crying about this?! It\u2019s not that big a deal!\u201d But it was like there was a tap somewhere that I couldn\u2019t find, so I couldn\u2019t turn it off. My clinical depression was missed for more 40 years because it didn\u2019t look like clinical depression usually does. I wasn\u2019t sad, I showed no obvious signs of depression. It took not just a psychiatrist to diagnose it, but one specializing in depression. I went on meds and my life changed within a couple of days. If this was just a one-time thing, it would be because we are first feeling beings. If you have not allowed a feeling to surface, if you have been pushing it down, it will come out in ways you do not expect or recognize. If it\u2019s none of those, then I don\u2019t know. ",
