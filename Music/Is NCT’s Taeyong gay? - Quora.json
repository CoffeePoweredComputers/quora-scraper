            "answer_text": "The short answer is no, officially he has never stated or hinted at being gay. And frankly it none of our business to speculate and call him or any idol out. I\u2019m going to paste an answer I wrote for a similar question awhile back: Korea is still a very conservative country and the general public is still not very open to the LGBT community. It\u2019s gotten better over the years but still a huge work in progress. There\u2019s hundreds of active Kpop idols today, so statistically, you can\u2019t tell me they\u2019re all straight. BUT it\u2019s none of our business to speculate and point fingers. Again, the general public still isn\u2019t very open to the LGBT community and history has shown that Korea is not exactly friendly to gay/lesbian entertainers: Example one being Hong Seok-cheon. He is an actor/variety star who was basically at the top of the korean entertainment world in the late 1990s. At the height of his career, he admitted he was gay in an interview and he lost almost everything instantly. He was fired off of a lot of shows he was on, hasn\u2019t scored many major acting parts since, and was generally shunned by the public. He\u2019s bounced back a bit over the years and is still active in the entertainment industry as a huge advocate of LGBT rights but his career never rebounded to what it was in the 90s. Another example is the group K\u2019Population. They were a group that saw some success in the early/mid 2000s. But then there was speculation that 2 members were dating each other that surfaced. The 2 specific members were never revealed but it was one of the major causes for the group to suddenly disband in 2004 due to public backlash. Third example is Lovelyz\u2019s Jisoo, right before their debut, rumors spread online from a girl who claimed to have dated Jisoo in the past. She said that Jisoo was abusive to not only her but other girls as well. Long story short, Jisoo didn\u2019t promote with the group for their debut because of this scandal and due to trauma from it. It was later proven false and the girls spreading the rumors were arrested. If a certain idol wants to come out to the public, they will when they feel ready. Again, it\u2019s none of our business to point fingers and call them out. Keep in mind, a lot of those hugs, kisses, handholding, and stares between members are basically fan service, they know fans go crazy so they play up the affection. The members often live together and are comfortable with each other like family, so they\u2019re not affraid to show affection. Also cultural differences between Korean and say America; in the US, guys often find sharing a bed weird but in Korea, showering together is considered normal. So don\u2019t get fooled by idols showing affection for one another and passing it off as \u201chints\u201d that they\u2019re gay. AB6ix\u2019s Lee Daehwi spoke about people making assumptions about his sexuality on a show recently. He was very annoyed that people kept calling him gay or assuming he is gay because he acts cute and likes a lot of feminine things. He said something along the lines of \u201cI have my own ideal type, rumors like that make me angry.\u201d I would imagine the same would apply to any other idol. ",

            "answer_text": "I think he\u2019s gay. I saw someone say that Taeyong has never hinted at being gay. That person is wrong. Taeyong literally said in an interview that he has no interest in girls. Based on that statement, he\u2019s either gay or an aromantic asexual. Gay people are way more common that aromantic asexuals so I\u2019m going with gay. Also Taeyong has expressed interest in dating, just not with women. I\u2019ll explain further why I think Taeyong is gay. He\u2019s gotten flustered by men multiple times. I know there was the scandal involving him being homophobic in his school days. I honestly think he had a lot of internalized homophobia but is more comfortable with his sexuality nowadays. I know he\u2019s related to Hong Suk Chung who is one of the few openly gay celebs in Korea and they didn\u2019t find out they were related or met until 2018. Hong Suk Chung could\u2019ve helped Taeyong become comfortable with his sexuality. ",
