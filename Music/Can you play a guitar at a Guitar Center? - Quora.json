            "answer_text": "Unfortunately you can. This is the chains down fall. I am 64 years old, a child of the late 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s. I have for the past 30 years had the money to indulge my fantasies and buy what ever equipment I desire. As much as I want, I have never been able to make a major purchase in a Guitar Center Store. Online at Guitar Center, yes. In the store, no. They are full of young punks with no money, showing off riffs at full volume. The staff dotes on them so much that it is impossible to get answers, to try out gear. I get frustrated and go to a local store for my purchase. These kids are in Guitar Center all weekend, they tie up the equipment and staff and probably buy a $ 4 bag of picks. The other problem is the major manufacturers\u2019 control pricing so I can call a local store and get the same pricing as Guitar Center. If Guitar Center was smart they\u2019d use their size to ban the guitar rats and bust the pricing cartel . ",

They were having sticky fingered misfits carrying their higher end Martins, Gibsons, Taylors, etc., out the front door, stealing them\u2026\u2026NOW, you have to ask, to get your hands on a higher end guitar, at Guitar Center, which they will gladly get for you\u2026\u2026..As usual, it is the few \u2018bad apples\u2019, that makes it harder on us honest folks\u2026\u2026..I had a salesman tell me, some miscreant walked out the front door with a brand new,nearly $3,000.00 Martin drednought,and not one of them seen him, and they were watching.

I worked in a music store in the 80s (small pro shop outside NYC not a big box) and peoplewho can actually play are almost always welcome. But unlessyou are testing out the limits of an amp, best not to crank itthrough the roof. Instrumental stuff goes over better as there isnothing missing. BUT do not construe this as it is fine to practiceand woodshed on the show room floor. ",
