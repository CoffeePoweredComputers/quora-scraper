            "answer_text": "Why does anybody dislike or like anything as subjective as music? While I think that Adam Nyan\u2019s response is sufficient and brings a lot of context to the discussion, I would add that the issue of plagiarism, especially as it refers to music and melodic composition, is something of a red herring, in that total originality is almost impossible. I believe, even or perhaps especially because I have been playing bass for over 20 years now, that everything any musician plays will have either or conscious or subconscious originating influence that betrays any hope of complete originality and uniqueness. Anything that we listen to, in order for it to be anything other than dissonant, must have a musical structure that is arranged in such a way as to appeal to the listening ear. Because available notes and structures are finite, there will always be flavors or similarities to something else. Of course exact copies of rhythm, chord progressions, etc, are obvious, but nuanced similarities and subtle differences can always be detected from band to band and score to score throughout various genres. I may be overstating to obvious, but because I do absolutely dig Led Zeppelin, I just wanted to reiterate a defense of their music, even in consideration of the obvious blues influences and riff replications in some of their material. If the dislike of LZ is because of the thought that they are unoriginal, then I would ask those with such a contention to show me any single band or musician that is completely original in their minds. I like LZ but I don\u2019t like The Beatles. I prefer The Rolling Stones over The Kinks. I would rather listen to Neil Diamond than Barry Manilow. But, I wouldn\u2019t ever assert any qualitative difference as my point for my preferences. Although there might be something to the assertion that John Lennon and Paul McCartney are somehow \u201cbetter\u201d than Jagger and Richards, all of the criterium by which one could measure such a claim would ultimately be subjective standards for what one prefers. Why do some people dislike Led Zeppelin? Because they prefer Belgian electronic/house music or polkas. Or maybe because Jimmy Page didn\u2019t sign an autograph or Robert Plant\u2019s hair was too long. Who knows? Just my opinion. Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "Led Zeppelin was a great band, they inspired and influenced many others. When it comes to the band they or their separate members are often declared as the best, they have a certain godlike standing with some people. The truth is a bit more mixed. When people are thinking of the godlike Led Zeppelin they are only think of the period between 1968\u20131972. Everyone just completely ignores the fact that the band existed until 1980. Thus the largest part of their career is practically completely ignored. Why is that? It is basically because they were not very prolific or inspiring during this time. Robert Plant basically destroyed his voice in 1972, Jimmy Pages\u2019 playing was incredibly sloppy during this time because he was addicted to heroine, John Bonham was an alcoholic. The only one who really held things together was John Paul Jones. Therefore it is somewhat reconstructed history to claim that they were just always the best. There were many other great bands during this era that never receives the same credit. Deep Purple is a good example, they had their equal share of excellenct musicians. Led Zeppelin would never have existed if it wasn\u2019t for the Yardbirds. Cream existed before Led Zeppelin, they were heavily influential at the time, but they are hardly recognized today. In fact claiming they were alway the best somewhat removes their human qualities, they were magnificent at their height, but they also had very human struggles to face. Claiming that they were always the best removes the human connection from the band, and makes it easy to disconnect from their music. ",
