            "answer_text": "Your question seems worded in a confusing way, so I will do my best to respond correctly. If you're trying to ask if they might have concerts in 2021, then yes obviously they will. This is because they always do a yearly world tour, and have multiple dates added to their schedule. They won't make a remake of the online concert (in real life), if that's also what you may be asking. ",
