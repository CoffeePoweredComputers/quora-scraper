If you like a song very much, it is least possible for you to stop humming that song.You keep on singing that one(happens with me most of the times :-p)\u2026.. and when this happens, it gets registered into your mind along with its tune. There you go\u2026. now you remember the song! When the 1D\u2019s \u2018Made in the A.M\u2019 was released, there is one song in that album- Drag me down. The music and lyrics were so attractive and simple too and something really dragged me towards that song and for almost one week the song was dancing under my toungue(;-p)!! I even hum the music and i remember every bit of a sec in the song. I mean to say , lyrics, music, timing, everything\u2026. Not only this , most of the 1D songs would drive me crazy. Like , Live while we\u2019re youngWhat makes you beautifulOne thingBest song everDiana etc.Try to feel and understand the song and I bet you would love to fall in love with songs. When this happens, you will come to know the answer for your question! Hope you will know it soon! :) Thank you! ",
