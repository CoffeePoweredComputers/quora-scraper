            "answer_text": "This is an action that YouTube could take against you, yes. It is not so much your channel, as it is your account that is getting hit with a copyright strike. Heck, they have the option of blocking your account for days, weeks, months. Making your content unfindable and locking you out from new uploads. And, in the most extreme cases, they can ban your account permanently (an action they typically only do for beheading videos or porn, not copyright infringement). Be aware, failure for YouTube to take action on videos that contain copyright infringing music leaves YouTube open to being sued by the record company for distribution of the music without a license. It jumps from being your problem to being both YouTube\u2019s and your problem, if they fail to hold to an anti copyright infringement policy. They cannot take that risk. Now, is this a likely response for one copyright strike? No, it is not. But why are you even starting down the path of breaking policy? One instance in which you don\u2019t get caught tends to lead to trying again. And then, four videos later, they all get copyright strikes in the same week and your account gets banned. Just seek out free music online and stay on the right side of the law. From where I can get free music for my YouTube videos? ",

            "answer_text": "It is illegal copyright infringement to use someone else's copyrighted music in your video without their permission whether you monetize it or not. Crediting that music's owner or including a statement that you do not own the music is not getting their permission to use it and therefore still is infringement. Some cover songs may be eligible for monetization. To be eligible, the music publisher must claim the song through the Content ID system and elect to monetize it. If the song has not been claimed, you can't monetize your video unless you have explicit written permission from the rights owner of the song.
