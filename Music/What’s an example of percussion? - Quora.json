            "answer_text": "In rock, jazz, blues, latin and many other styles of music, when there is a list of performers and their instruments, you will see someone credited with playing drums. Often there are others credited with playing percussion. Now, kit drums are percussion instruments, and normally have the typical snare/tom/tenor and bass drum with assorted cymbals (and drummers may add to that minimal set 1\u201340 more drums\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m looking at you Terry Bozzio). Drummers may also have a wide variety of percussion effects attached to the drum kit, such as cowbell, wood block, chimes, etc. When there are more percussion effects desired in order to get the feel the group wants, someone in the group, or a guest, will play some other instrument such as tambourine, clav\u00e9, triangle, and maybe even bongoes, Congas, Djembe or Doumbec. Peter Gabriel, for example, will always be credited with the singing role, but often used to play a bass (kick-) drum, and tambourine at center-stage. He would get a percussion credit, then. I could go on and on, but I hope you get the idea, and this answers your question to some degree. For a great example of percussion, see Santana live doing \u201cOye Como Va\u201d, such as in Live at Tanglewood, 1970  ",
