I had the pleasure of kissing the lovely Coleen Nolan once when she was going out with Shane Richie (before they were married), I used to know Shane fairly well in those days and Coleen was and still is a great beauty . Also \u201c Dance Little Lady Dance \u201c by Tina Charles, has the line \u201c Dance, Dance, Dance \u201c. Released in 1976 . Can\u2019t think of any more, I was born in 1947 for goodness sake, what more do you want ? Hope this helps , Dave. ",
