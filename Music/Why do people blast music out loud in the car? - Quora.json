            "answer_text": "These answers are a joke. Music is a part of life. When your car has a good sound system, the emotions can be brought out especially at high volume. Most of us nowadays live next to neighbors. We can't blast our music thus emotions related to it can't be felt. In a car, you're moving constantly. So you can crank it up and it won't bother the average person. Of course there's people that can't handle a car driving by playing loud music for a couple seconds. I can, it's called a public roadway for a reason. There are loud sounds. I find a car blasting music going by is a lot less annoying then someone driving a straight piped Civic and just revving it. Or idiots on motorcycles just revving away showing off. There's something called freedom when driving. That freedom is enhanced when you can just crank it up on the wide open road. My driving sessions are a way to deal with emotions. Loud music helps manage my anger. I find this better than doing what most do to deal with stress. This includes drugs, alcohol, and crimes. I'm anti-drug and do not drink. I'm healthy and very happy of it. No, I'm not deaf. Music is not a constant noise thus you rarely will loose hearing because of it. Hearing damage occurs with time of exposure of loud SPL, not short peaks. Music is a way of life and some of us just like it loud. (With good sound quality of course). If the sound quality isn't there, then it's not worth cranking. When I blast music in my car, it usually means a good song has come on that more than likely has my own personal emotions tied to it. When that happens, I really crank it. I might even shed a few tears. Even if it is an upbeat song. It's about the emotions. Happy listening! Some day, I will have a house away from neighbors. Then, I will crank my vintage high end Hifi gear up and experience my music, not just listen to it. ",

            "answer_text": "A number of factors are in play here: Utter and complete selfishness and lack of concern for others. \u201cI do what I want to do and I don\u2019t care in the slightest if it negatively impacts the people around me.\u201dA desperate need for attention. Usually combined with:An undeniable lack of any type of skills or talents that might get them that attention they so desperately crave, and the sad belief that, lacking any sort of talent or skills themselves, someone else\u2019s talent and creative expression reflects a little bit on them if they feature it. (i.e. \u201cwell I cannot sing or write songs or do absolutely anything that anyone else would ever pay money for or even sit through for free, but if I loudly play music from people who have been successful, in contrast to the talent-less, pathetically unsuccessful, un-creative and unproductive waste of space that I am, that somehow means I\u2019m successful and creative, and not a total failure.\u201dBelief that this is socially acceptable because people are unwilling to confront them. People who lack empathy and are self-absorbed and self-centered are potentially very dangerous. Some of the people who do this are just completely clueless that it\u2019s rude and bothers people, but many just don\u2019t care. Polite people can\u2019t tell if they are dealing with a reasonable, potentially considerate but just ignorant person, or a self-centered borderline sociopath, so they rarely say anything.Reinforcement from other people who do this, again buttressing the idea that it\u2019s socially acceptable. \u201cEveryone does it\u201d they think. But everyone doesn\u2019t do it. Rude, inconsiderate people with low-self esteem regarding their own pathetic lack of accomplishments do it. These are in no shortage, though , so they get plenty of reinforcement.",
