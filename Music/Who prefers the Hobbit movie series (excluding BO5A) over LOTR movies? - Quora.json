            "answer_text": "Probably those who haven\u2019t read the book, haven\u2019t watched LOTR, or aren\u2019t mature enough for LOTR. Back to a time when I knew nothing of LOTR except that Legolas is a hot elf, I watched The Hobbit, and it was such an experience for me. What\u2019s not to like? You\u2019ll have: An adorable hobbitThree hot dwarves, one of whom hot enough to be noticed by a hot elfInterracial love storyLegolas\u201cGo back to the voooiiiiiiidddd from whence you came!\u201dI was so hyped about it, and was so disappointed because my parents who are LOTR fans didn\u2019t appreciate it. They slept through most of it like I did for LOTR, which cannot be since The Hobbit is clearly better. Right? Obviously, I had poor taste for fantasy. I haven\u2019t even read Harry Potter then yet. After I did, I decided to go for The Hobbit and LOTR next. Here\u2019s what I got from reading the book: An adorable hobbitTwelve courageous and loyal dwarvesTwo young dwarves dying for their uncleAnd that\u2019s it. What? No Legolas? No Tauriel? No side-mission for Gandalf? No Galadriel? Everything I knew was a lie! That\u2019s when I realized that I had been looking at the wrong themes of the story. Who needs interracial love if you can have interracial friendship? Who needs three badass elves \u2014 who aren\u2019t even in the book \u2014 if you can have twelve dwarves who bravely fight alongside for honor and their home? Who needs Legolas the hot elf if he isn\u2019t even in the book (at least not yet) and is only in the movie to serve as the iceberg for the (nonexistent) ship about to sail (ship pertaining to Tauriel and Kili)? That\u2019s when I realized how immature I was. I immediately then watched and read LOTR and I was absolutely taken by it, not only because there\u2019s a hot elf named Legolas there, but because of what it teaches us about loyalty, friendship, and greed, among other things.

            "answer_text": "Nobody sane! Everyone is, of course, entitled to their opinion, and I actually enjoyed The Hobbit series in spite of many LOTR fans loathing it, but overall it pales in comparison to LOTR for many reasons, not the least of which the fact that LOTR was a scaled down version of the books (meaning they really had to pick and choose the best parts to use) while The Hobbit was a much exaggerated version of the book (meaning they took a simple child\u2019s story and turned it into three movies).
