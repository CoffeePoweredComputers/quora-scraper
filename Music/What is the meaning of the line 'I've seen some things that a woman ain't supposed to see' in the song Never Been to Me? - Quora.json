            "answer_text": "There seem to be a lot of mixed feelings about this song. Written by two men, some feel it carries a message not consistent with today\u2019s view of equality. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some things that a woman ain\u2019t supposed to see\u201d, probably refers to a life (gender roles being moot) of choosing what makes her feel good, what she really wants to do as a person, not a woman. She has a strong sexually appetite, many lovers/no restrictions, perhaps an abortion (or two), choosing her way on her terms, and not what would be expected of a \u201cgood girl\u201d. No boundaries. The line, \u2018undressed by kings\u2019, might refer not just to scope, but perhaps prostitution. Meaning Of The Line You Requested: conservative notions about the \u201cgood girl\u201d, one who shouldn\u2019t, perhaps, seen and experienced all the singer suggests she\u2019s done.
