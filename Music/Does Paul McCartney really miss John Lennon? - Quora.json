            "answer_text": "They had a level of friendship that most people never experience. If you\u2019ll allow me, I\u2019ll talk about myself, in order to give some sort of inside insight of such a relationship: I had a friendship a bit like that in my life: part rivalry, part looking to the other for validation, going through very formative years together, bond together stronger than with our respective girlfriend, getting on the nerves of each other but forgiving everything because we were more than brothers. So close that there was no room for any other strong relationship, and in order to get on with our lives, and when we finally met girls important enough to be our life partners, we made room: the pettiness that had built up along the 15 years of friendship because when you forgive everything, there\u2019s always a bit of resentment here, a bit of resentment there, exploded on the most mundane of trigger and we\u2026 broke up, there\u2019s no other word. Thing is: we lost contact, and haven\u2019t speak in about 20 years. But when I talk about him, and despite the strong relationships and friendships I built since, I still talk about \u201cmy best friend\u201d. I still thing about him regularly, I still miss him, and no relationship has ever come close of what we had. I don\u2019t have a single doubt about Paul McCartney missing John Lennon. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Sir Paul said it in his own words. The following is excerpted from pages 74-75 chapter 5, \"Using Music Therapy and Imagined Interactions to Cope with Stress,\" of a new book; https://www.peterlang.com/view/title/67880?format=EPDF\"In a Rolling Stone interview, Sir Paul discusses how he has imagined interactions with John Lennon, founder of the band and George Harrison, who was a guitarist. Lennon was brutally assassinated in December of 1980 when he was shot at point blank range in New York while George Harrison died of lung cancer that spread to his brain in 2001. In 1999, he warded off an intruder in his home who stabbed him in the lung and causing head injuries before his wife incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a fireplace poker and a lamp. Anyone can google the trauma of Lennon\u2019s assassination. Sir Paul has discussed his contempt for the assassin. However, he has imagined interactions with John in the recording studio that reveals how he is using the relational maintenance function and catharsis as a way to continually deal with this trauma. He said the following about imagining John Lennon being in the recording studio with him.There was another collaborate in the room, who\u2019s been there for decades. If I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m not sure about this, I\u2019ll throw it across the room to John. (Following are the literal lines of imaginary dialogue:  John: You can\u2019t go there, man Paul: You\u2019re quite right. How about this?John: Yeah, that\u2019s better. ",
