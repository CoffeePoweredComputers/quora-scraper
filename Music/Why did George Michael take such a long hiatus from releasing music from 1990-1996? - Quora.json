            "answer_text": "His hiatus wasn't quite that long. It was more like two years. He was in the process of recording volume two of Listen Without Prejudice. However he in the midst of his legal scrap with Sony, so he never finished it. Three songs he had recorded for it ended up on the Red Hot + Dance album which was released to raise money for AIDS awareness. In 1992, he released Too Funky, which was a top ten hit and performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. After that, he did take a break. In 1994, he released Jesus to a Child, which he had written for Anselmo Feleppa, who was his lover at the time. Anselmo had died of AIDS. I think the six years you're referring to is the time between Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 and Older, because six years did pass between thosetwo albums. ",
