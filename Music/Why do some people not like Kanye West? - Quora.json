            "answer_text": "Personally, I am a massive fan of Kanye West, who has listened to his entire discography and considers him to have multiple classic albums under his belt. But I know just as well as we all do that not everyone on earth is going to like the same things. I have encountered multiple Kanye haters throughout my lifetime and discussed their negative feelings about him with them. I would say that the main reasons people are not fans of West would be: They do not like rap music, which is the genre that his music classifies as. Different types of music appeal to different people, so some Kanye fans may hate artists of a different genre due to them not liking that style of music.They are not fans of him due to the media portraying him as a horrible person. Often West's antics are published online, in tabloids, etc. and for some people, this is only what they will ever see of him and a lot of fake stories have actually increased his number of haters.They only hate on him because they believe it is cool or trendy to do so. Yes, some people give no reason other than \u201cBecause he's a faggot\" or \u201cBecause you [talking to me] like him\" which is obviously them just hating on him because a noticeable amount of people they like have said that they do which makes it trendy, or in the case of me and possibly others, people they don't like are fans which makes it cool to hate him in their eyes.",
