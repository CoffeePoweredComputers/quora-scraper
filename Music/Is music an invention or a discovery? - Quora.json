            "answer_text": "Google definitions : Music: vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion. Invent:  create or design (something that has not existed before); be the originator of.  Discover: find unexpectedly or during a search. So what we can say here is, Music is a combination  (Permutation rather) of vocal or instrumental sounds, or more precisely, NOTEs, which are nothing but acoustic frequencies. Human beings are able to receive frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz - of the total spectrum. Bats are capable of producing frequencies beyond this range - an example as such says that there have been acoustic frequencies in the atmosphere before Humans came into being.  So, frequencies were there before Humans' existence ; what was not there, is the combination of frequencies which we find harmonic, beautiful and expression of emotions. So, in my opinion it is a discovery rather than invention. P.S:  Just like whether a music is good or total trash is a personal taste, where to find music is also very similar. You might find music only in Lata Mangeshkar's voice or ,  the sound of gushing wind might also sound musical enough to your ears. Since it is a matter of taste and in that way the definition of music is very broad, it can never be termed as a \"Creation\" of humans. It was already there, we just discovered it. Hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "Really great question! Im loving the answers and perspectives here. I'd say niether. It is a realization. Comes really close to Discovery, but not one. Music is any sound which sounds good & to which our brains can relate.  Music has always Existed, but we started noticing the pattern in it, recently. Everything has a pattern and different brains like different sounds.What may be music to you may not be for me.  I personally like the sound of Tidal waves & Birds chirping. It has always been there, but we started Realizing it later. ",
