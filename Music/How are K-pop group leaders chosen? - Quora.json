            "answer_text": "Different companies has different preferences, some choose by age, talent or experience. But they all have to have one thing in common: and that\u2019s leadership skills. Being able to lead a group and having the member\u2019s respect is important, so it\u2019s only natural the leader would be one of the elder members seeing as how in Korean culture, age is highly respected. Communication: Leaders also need to be able to communicate and lead the team, they\u2019re usually the ones to introduce their group on tv/radioshows etc so have to have good public speaking skills. Being proficient in different languages is also seen as a bonus for leaders, especially english, japanese or chinese. Skills: Being able to produce/write/make music for the team is also a leader quality. Leaders are usually either a main vocalist or rapper in order to be able to create music for the group. (other members also produce etc\u2026 but someone with these skills are more likely to be chosen over someone without) Taking this all into account, it\u2019s then the company\u2019s job to make a decision, usually taking into consideration the member\u2019s opinions and feelings on who they think could lead their group.

            "answer_text": "It depends on the company, but either by age, seniority, or charisma. Here are some examples of leaders who are the eldest in their groups: Irene (Red Velvet)Sowon (GFRIEND)Solar (Mamamoo)Here are some examples of leaders who have the most training experience in their groups: Jihyo (Twice)JB (GOT7)Here are some examples of leaders who were chosen for some other reason, probably for their charisma: Soyeon ((G)I-DLE)CL (2NE1)RM (BTS)Although some leaders seem to have been chosen simply for their age or experience, they also probably had to have good leadership skills. I\u2019m sure that if Irene or Jihyo couldn\u2019t lead, they wouldn\u2019t have been chosen to lead their groups. Most times, leaders are the most mature or most caring in the group, in addition to being able to command respect\u2014this could be why experienced or older members are chosen as leaders. Hope this helps! ",
