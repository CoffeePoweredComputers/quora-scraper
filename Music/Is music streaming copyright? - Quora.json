            "answer_text": "Not unless you or someone you authorized records the stream. There are a few requirements for something to be protected by copyright and one of them is that it must be fixed in a tangible medium either by the author or by someone authorized to do so by the author. Just as something would not be protected if you only spoke it to people listening at that time, something would not be protected if you streamed it and made no effort to create a persistent recording of it. This wouldn\u2019t apply to any elements that were already fixed in a tangible medium, of course. If I stream a performance of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and nobody records it, I would hold no copyright to that performance. That wouldn\u2019t change the fact that the song itself is already protected by copyright, of course. See Fixed in a Tangible Medium of Expression, 17 USC 101, and 17 USC 102 for more information. ",
