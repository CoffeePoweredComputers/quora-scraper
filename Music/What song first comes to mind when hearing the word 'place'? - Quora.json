The steak place. The steak place Cheap carpet lines the way Aluminium tack door handles Candelabra lions head Via butchers display too. The steak placeThe steak place Via a carcass rowThings are brought forward and eaten, I see the corners filled with hitmen, Two young lawyers they are whispering, in The steak placeThe steak place I want to stay here, I don't want to go anywhere, I could remain here, Head down Head down Head down Head, head, head downThe steak placeThe steak place I'd stop the automation, I'd sit behind dusty lace, I have a word with hitmen, I give off a beatific face. The steak placeThe steak placeFrom New York City run screaming, Into New England states, Combined a man not should have to do this, A man should not use his fist in The steak place.The steak place. I want to stay here, I don't want to go anywhere, I shall remain here. Songwriters: B.E. Smith / Mark E Smith The Steak Place lyrics \u00a9 BMG Rights Management US, LLC ",
