            "answer_text": "Before I write I must clarify one thing. No equipment are great, it\u2019s the user who makes it great. Now coming back to the point. GoPro camera range was started with keeping adventurous people in mind. Originally, surfers were primary users as the founder himself is an avid wave surfer. Later as time progressed, GoPro range became phenomena of adventure photography. GoPro camera, when coupled with specially designed casing, becomes one of the most versatile camera. It is waterproof, shockproof, dust-proof (to an extant), can stand freezing point temperature, survives high altitudes and maintains high quality video footage in wide angle to provide an immersive view. Number of mounts extends the capability of GoPro by making is Go-Anywhere-Professional camera. You can mount it on your pet animal, on motorbike, on surfboard, skis, your own chest, shoulder, helmet and everywhere possible. There are other cameras which are trying hard to be as-good-as-GoPro, but clearly none of them are willing to go extra mile and try to beat it. It could be beaten in several features that rivals are providing, but when it comes to Video Quality, none of them appear close enough. So what makes GoPro great? It\u2019s their wide user base and no-compromise on quality products. Thanks for A2A ",

            "answer_text": "I just posted the following answer on another thread, but it actually fits better here. \u2014 Well, here\u2019s a contrary opinion. I\u2019ve got Hero2s, 3s, 4s, and now the Hero5 Blacks. The 2s and 3s are gone. I want the new Hero6 Blacks. Each camera gets better. There are a lot of inexpensive accessories from a number of companies. The 4s communicated with a smart phone OK, and the Hero5s do it much better. Full camera control, except, of course, positioning. There\u2019s still a sort of a lag between what\u2019s being recorded and what the smartphone sees, but the delay is very acceptable. There is a long lag time, I believe 6 seconds, with the Hero4. Hopefully the lag time will be further improved with the Hero6. This lag time to the smartphone is a critical spec. to me, but in many situations you can live with a bit of lag time. There\u2019s a number of competitors out there and they bear watching. I don\u2019t automatically assume that GoPro is the best or most cost-effective solution. Their mount system is now a standard, and so popular that a lot more accessories based on that mount are made by others than by GoPro. Some competitive cameras use the GoPro mount system, others use the more traditional 1/4\u2033x20 receptacle. There are GoPro to 1/4x20 adapters, and also the reverse. Some competitive cameras, like the GoPro, are waterproof and don\u2019t require a housing, others, like the Nikon KeyMission 170, do. Some will have better audio than GoPro, others won\u2019t. And most will have better lensing systems than the GoPros. Anybody in the market for a GoPro should google the term \u201cGoPro competitors\u201d and then do some serious shopping. This market is specialized, highly competitive, and flooded with gear at great prices. Final thought: Buy a floating handgrip when you buy your camera. Buy a few other accessories and mount systems also. You may get the bug and want to buy more. Go to ebay and search \u201cGoPro accessories\u201d. ",
