            "answer_text": "You may say so. Playing the piano improves the balance between the two hemispheres of your brain. Therefore, improves the neural connections responsible for an objective and clear thinking. Once you\u2019re able to better perceive all the information around you, understand it, connect it with previous knowledge and built something new and creative from that, you can say your IQ was increased. But it will only happen if you go deep into music learning and piano playing. And even more, if you enjoy every step of the way. Otherwise, the results will be too shallow and you may not realize the difference. Let me know if I can help you any further. ",
