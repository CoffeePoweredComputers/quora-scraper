But his name alone has become synonymous with levels of rage and annoyance previously unheard of amongst internet users worldwide. For every hater, however, Bieber has an army of preteen girls to defend his honor. \u2014 And I know, it sucks! However, I'm not here to encourage the haters or to just give them even more reasons to hate him, even more, just for kicks! And by the way, the following is just another or possibly a kind of those Documentaries of Bieber's 'rise to success'. \u2014 So don't judge the facts.  Image Courtesy @asifahsankhan  Question: How did this baby-faced Canadian teenager managed to take over the world? Answer: With a little help from 76 million Facebook fans, 77.7 million Twitter followers and 3 billion hits on YouTube! He was listed three times by Forbes (Forbes.com and magazine) among the top ten most powerful celebrities in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2013. [1] Now this may take a while, but don't you wanna know why the **** is he so famous? And why is he still has more lovers than haters? Read...  Justin Bieber (musician) \u2014 Born on March 1st, 1994 in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber is now 22 years old. While he\u2019s known for his pre-pubescent, high pitched voice, he is also capable of playing drums, piano, guitar, and trumpet. If you\u2019re reading Techie, I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume you\u2019re not a fan of his work. (neither am I but I ain't a hater either) Nevertheless, his musical aptitude cannot be denied. A Surprising Fact: After he cut his hair, in 2011, he auctioned it for $12,000 on eBay. It sold for about $40,000.Unsurprisingly, he donated the proceeds to charity. The real question, though, is what the bidder is doing with a bag of Justin\u2019s dead hair\u2026  Image Courtesy @asifahsankhan \u2014 Infos at IMDb / Biography.com / Justin Bieber | Official Website  I'm not even a fan, but I honestly do like a few of his songs. (Who doesn't?) And I hate to admit it but he sure is a force to be reckon with. I even saw a few people here on Quora (product) asking whether he's more famous than Barack Obama or Michael Jackson. Hilarious? Well, in a sense. Hysterical? definitely, for this generation of over-obsessed Teenagers and Teenage Life.

Clip courtesy of WatchMojo.com  How Justin Bieber Initially Came to Be? From YouTube Sensation to one of the biggest Pop Icons in history: Bieber\u2019s road to fame started towards the end of 2007, when he placed second in a local singing competition covering Ne-Yo\u2018s \u201cSo Sick\u201d (see video below). Bieber\u2019s mother Pattie Mallette, being the proud parent that she is, then uploaded the video to YouTube for friends and family to watch \u2014 and so it began. Mallette continued to upload various cover songs and performances to his YouTube channel, and his popularity slowly grew, gaining new fans and subscribers by the day.  Luckily for Bieber, his videos fell upon the right set of eyes\u2026 accidentally. Former So So Def marketing executive Scooter Braun randomly stumbled upon one of Bieber\u2019s videos, and was highly impressed. Braun tracked down Bieber\u2019s school, and later got in contact with his mother. Eventually, she agreed to allow Justin to fly to Atlanta and record demos. During this timeframe, thanks to Usher, Bieber got an audition with Island Def Jam Music Group. Island Records signed Bieber in 2008, and the rest is history, Bieber\u2019s face was plastered all over the internet faster than you could say \u201cChocolate Rain.\u201d Thanks, YouTube!  How Did Justin Bieber Get Discovered:  The voice behind phenomenal hits such as \"Baby\"\u2014 \"One Less Lonely Girl\" \u2014 \"One Time\" and \"Favorite Girl\", is one of the most famous singing sensations in his generation. As proof to that, he had some of the most successful shows not only in his home country but in other parts of the world. And there were some instances when the crowd goes crazy about him causing stampedes in his concerts. For those of you who do not know Justin Bieber very well, you may be interested about the story behind his success. How Justin Bieber was Discovered | In 2010 Justin Bieber go from YouTube to \"We are the World\" in a year? Bieber tells Katie Couric the story on CBS (TV Network)  Justin Bieber was first seen on YouTube and was discovered by Scooter Braun, now his manager. After that, Braun scheduled a meeting between Justin and Usher. Soon after, Bieber signed under the recording outfit owned by Braun and Usher, Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG).  In 2009, the very first song Justin Bieber released was \"One Time\", a hit that landed in the Top 30 charts in over ten countries around the globe. Then in November 17, 2009 his debut album \"My World\" was also launched in the market. This album was certified platinum in the United States and made Bieber even more famous in that there were seven songs from the album that simultaneously landed a spot in the popular Billboard Hot 100. In January 2010, the hit song \"Baby\" was also launched. This had the same phenomenal success as that of \"One Time\". Two months later, in March 23, 2010, his first full-length album entitled My World 2.0 was also released. This studio release placed Bieber once again on the top spot as it debuted at number one. Justin Bieber - Baby ft. Ludacris   How Did Usher Discover Justin Bieber? Usher is pretty much a God amongst men. He sees wandering prepubescent minstrels, touches their heads with his fedora, and BOOM! They become internationally famous mega-stars. But despite rumors to the contrary, Usher did not discover Justin Bieber. That honor belongs to Scooter Braun, a hip-hop manager who came across The Bieber's videos on YouTube and immediately fell in love with his man-bangs.  Image via Entertainment Weekly: Justin Bieber and Usher face $10 million copyright lawsuit Scooter introduced Justin to User shortly after discovering him, and they signed a three-way publishing venture at Raymond Braun Media Group and a recording contract with Island Records. The rest is history! Justin and Usher are total brosefs, have performed together, and Usher even made a cameo in Justin's movie, Never Say Never (OMG, we won't Justin! We won't ever say never!). \"When I met him, his personality won me over,\" Usher tells the Los Angeles Times. \"When he sang, I realized we were dealing with the real thing. His voice just spoke to the type of music I would want to be associated with. And it wasn\u2019t a gimmick \u2014 we had to teach him how to dance and be on stage, but he really had a good voice.\" As you might expect, Usher monitors all of Justin's creative endeavors. \"Aside from Justin being my prot\u00e9g\u00e9, we stay in contact with each other by way of iChat or Blackberry, just to stay in the loop with him. But when we\u2019re working on the album, we work very close-knit in the studio.\" Sigh, this is the most beautiful bromance since Justin Timberlake and Nick Carter. 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys. Oh wait, they were mortal Boy-Band enemies. | See: http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/04/justin-bieber-usher-interview-times.html  Watch: The Fabulous Life Of 'Justin Bieber' Full Episode New 25/05/2014 \u2014 (but this video only describes how fabulous he & his life is...)   The Real Question\u2014 Justin Bieber \u2013 why is he still famous? \u2014 WHY? These days, we all know that YouTube becomes a venue to showcase our innate talents. Luckily,Justin Bieber had his share of fortune after he had been discovered through this channel. In fact, New York Times' Jan Hoffman said that the YouTube fame for Justin Bieber is something the singer should be proud of in his career. His song \"One Time\" earned millions of hits in the channel. Braun also took advantage of the popularity of the video channel in promoting Justin Bieber. Before he even signed up Bieber under RBMG, he asked the artist to record songs and videos and they were all posted via YouTube. Braun even recalled saying that Justin should sing as if there were no other people watching him inside the room. Justin Bieber \u2013 reaching out to fans: Time and again, Bieber believed that he can reach out more to fans by uploading videos via YouTube. His song \"One Time\" became recognized because of the fact that it was uploaded through the channel. Apart from continuous uploads he made, however, Bieber also opened a Twitter account to be able to interact with his supporters. Now, fans may also access Justin Bieber's performances and other facts about his life via Facebook.com. Bieber is now one of the most widely followed users on Twitter, boasting an impressive 2.8 million followers. As annoying as he may be, Bieber isn\u2019t stupid; he understands the marketing power of Twitter and uses it to his advantage. Surprisingly, Justin is actually behind a majority of the tweets on his Twitter account. The only other person with access to his Twitter account is Scooter Braun, his manager. Braun notes that Bieber\u2019s Twitter account shows fans the same person who was talking to them before he got huge, is still talking to them now. Aside from Braun and Usher who started Justin Bieber's career path, there are a number of people this teen sensation should thank. His bodyguard Kenny, his manager and stylist Ryan Good as well as all adults behind him coached Justin when it comes to handling fame, fortune and image. Amidst a busy work schedule, Bieber still finds two hours per day to interact on Twitter. Hey, nobody said being a celebrity was easy. | Justin Bieber Official Website | Purpose Available Now  And the Tattoos: Justin Bieber Gives the Story Behind His Tattoos via GQ (magazine)   Dating and Relationships Bieber draw a massive amount of publicity for his on-off relationship with singer/actress Selena Gomez.  Justin Bieber began dating Selena Gomez in 2011. After cheating rumors involving Victoria\u2019s Secret model Barbara Palvin, the couple split for good in January 2013. Justin and Selena have since attempted to reunite, but nothing full-blown has ever materialized. Justin has been the center of several controversies, including being caught smoking what appeared to be marijuana in Jan. 2013, attacking a paparazzo in March 2013, and getting caught shadow-boxing inside the Anne Frank House in Apr. 2013. As of March 2015, Justin has been spending time with a number of different women, including Yovanna Ventura, Hailey Baldwin, Kendall Jenner and Shanina Shaik. Source: Hollywood Life [2]  Bieber and his Mother - and the relation between to two also gained much attention from the media as well as his love-life.  In a november, 2015 interview with Billboard (magazine) , Justin Bieber revealed that his once-close relationship with his mom, Pattie Mallette, has been \"pretty non existent\"; the singer admitted in a Billboard interview that his mom had moved to Hawaii and cut off most communication with him after an especially tough year, which included Bieber going to jail and police raiding his house. Source: Justin Bieber Wikipedia, Justin Bieber Bio, Facts, Net-worth, Family, Auto, Home  Famous in Infamous ways? \u2014 how he went from getting arrested to back on top in one year In June 2012, fresh off his third studio album \u201cBelieve,\u201d Bieber had sold over 3 million copies and gone platinum in the United States, Canada, Australia and Sweden. He had the most-viewed video on YouTube and had been the artist for pre-teen and teenage audiences. What happened? Bieber\u2019s album received mixed critical reviews and did not receive any Grammy nominations. He remained rather quiet for over a year, releasing a compilation album in December 2013 to capitalize on the Christmas rush and marketing phase. This album flopped, at least when it came to major pop star levels. It was released in a song-per-week format, with no songs reaching the top 25 on the Billboard charts. The album also failed to reach the Billboard Top 200 because of the way it was released.  In a way, the below incidents somehow made Bieber more famous than he usually was. Check them out: In 2013, Bieber first made negative headlines after a video surfaced in which he was seen urinating into a restaurant's mop bucket. He was said to be leaving a nightclub and decided to exit through the kitchen, but not before attempting to mark his territory. Toward the end of the video, Bieber can also be faintly heard saying, \"F--- Bill Clinton.\" It was a black eye for Bieber's public image, but it was just the beginning.  In December 2013, the same year he was charged with assaulting a limo driver. His case was later dropped by prosecutors when they realized they most likely wouldn't be able to get a conviction, but the damage to his reputation was done.  After a few months out of trouble, Bieber made headlines again for all the wrong reasons. In July 2014, Bieber was placed on probation after reaching a plea deal for egging a neighbor's house. He was ordered to pay over $80,000 in damages caused by the eggs, and he received a misdemeanor vandalism charge.  Justin Bieber released on bond from Miami jail for drunk driving arrest via The Guardian (newspaper)  A video grab (on the site) shows Justin Bieber appearing at Miami-Dade circuit court via video link from Richard Gerstein justice building. Photograph: Sky News Just one month later, Bieber reached another plea deal for what became his most serious charge to date. He was arrested on suspicion of participating in an illegal drag race in Miami.  Bieber was charged with careless driving and resisting arrest, and as part of that deal he was ordered to take an anger-management course, donate $50,000 to charity, and pay a $500 fine.  In September 2014, Bieber was arrested on charges of dangerous driving and assault from an accident between an ATV he was riding and a minivan in Canada. He later pleaded guilty to the charges and received a fine. Bieber was at a crossroads in his career. In the midst of his legal troubles, he officially announced his retirement via Twitter. But in a later interview with a Los Angeles radio station, he walked back his declaration: \"I want to grow as an artist, and I'm taking a step out. I want my music to mature.\" In June 2014, a video emerged of a 15-year-old Bieber telling a joke about black people, which used the word nigger multiple times. In the same month, a second video showed a 14-year-old Bieber giggling as he croons his song \"One Less Lonely Girl\", but parodying the main lyric as \"One less lonely nigger\", and stating that if he were to kill one, he'd be \"part of the KKK\". He apologized the day the latter was released: \"Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with.\" \u2014 See: Justin Bieber apologizes (again) for racist parody, KKK remarks Knowing he was struggling, Bieber went back to the basics, and the people who know him best. Being one of Bieber's biggest role models, Usher intervened. \"I can say I'm not happy with all the choices my friend has made, but I'm supportive of him,\" Usher told Billboard. \"He's making his own decisions and it's important to show support.\" Source: Billboard (magazine) \u2014 Justin Bieber, Khalil Hit The Streets For 'Playtime' Video  But in caring about Bieber and his well-being so much, Usher said he was not scared to put him in line. \"Our relationship is more man-to-man now,\" Usher added. \"I try my hardest to give as much positive reinforcement as I can. I'll punch him in the f------ chest when I need to, and give him a hug and kiss when I need to.\" They go way back. | See: Usher \"Not Happy\" With Justin Bieber, Punches Him When Needed  So now, in a way, Justin Bieber has become more infamous for his actions than famous for his music career. You hear his name all the time in the news. His bad behavior has been publicized over television, in magazines and on the Internet. In the past few years, Bieber has been accused of vandalism, reckless driving and throwing eggs at a neighbor\u2019s house. He was arrested after being pulled over for a DUI, for resisting arrest and having an expired license. Bieber was arrested again for assault and dangerous driving. It is more and more bad publicity for Justin Bieber. Yet, his popularity continues to grow larger and larger. Now, if you want to take this string of events as a publicity stunt, that's up to you. Bieber has continued to stay relevant despite performing on just seven songs in close to two years. None of those songs were his own singles, and only one had good commercial success \u2014 the Skrillex/Diplo song \u201cWhere Are You Now?\u201d The rest failed to rank on any U.S. Billboard chart. It really is surprising how relevant he has stayed considering everything that has happened in his career recently. Bieber has not trailed off like many teen pop stars do. Most people will not remember the names Aaron Carter, JC Chasez or Kevin Richardson. Most music pop stars aimed at younger audiences tend to fade, with only the biggest of fans remembering and even caring about the singer. | See: Whatever Happened To Justin Bieber?  Recent Years See: How Justin Bieber pulled off the comeback of the year: In December, 2015 BBC (broadcaster) reported: For a while there, it looked as if Justin Bieber's pop career might be slipping away in a flurry of shocked news reports. And yet, his current domination of the very top end of the singles chart - with three singles in the Top 5 - is confirmation that he's more popular as an adult than he was as a teenager. The question is, how did he do it? Where Are \u00dc Now (produced by Jack \u00dc; Diplo and Skrillex working together) took Justin out of the immaculate realms of confident superpop and gave him a fresh context within dance music. When it was followed by the equally sharp and inquisitive What Do You Mean, a gateway to a whole new audience had been opened up. \"What Do You Mean?\" immediately went to No. 1 on the Billboard charts \u2014 Bieber was officially back and one of the most prominent artists in the world again.  This interview with Grimmy nails the key moment of transition, in which the 21-year-old man takes greater control of his life, having learned lessons from his youth. He said: \"I named the album Purpose...because, for a while there, I feel like I lost my purpose, and I feel like I found my purpose again.\" It's not as if things won't ever go wrong again. In October 2015, Justin walked offstage during a gig in Norway, having lost patience with his audience during an attempt to wipe water off the stage with a towel. He later apologised on Instagram. The most important factor in the rehabilitation of Justin Bieber has been his acceptance by music fans in club music circles, far outside of the realms of chart pop. And while the quality of the songs is the key factor, some of that has come from his public acknowledgement that, yes, things did get a little bit crazy and he's still trying to be a better man, but for himself this time. In this interview with Annie Mac, he admits the pressure and the wild living distracted him from the job in hand: \"I think for a while there I forgot how much I loved being on stage, how much I love doing what I do and I think I took it for granted a little bit.\" Related: Justin Bieber is having a major comeback \u2014 how he went from getting arrested to back on top in one year  Trivia: He doesn\u2019t let #haters keep him down\u2026 despite negative reviews, his documentary Never Say Never grossed $100 million worldwide.In fact, NY Magazine described him as a \"bland, pious, profoundly unthreatening little Furby of a pop idol,\" but the 3D concert-film experience grossed him a pretty serious amount of money.He has been a target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, especially users of the Internet message board 4chan and of YouTube. [3]Nick Collins of The Daily Telegraph said that \"Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly sour note with his Internet critics\" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things.

The fan-base is called \"Beliebers,\" which the Chicago Tribune included as one of the top buzzwords of 2010.[5]Justin Bieber - Love Yourself (PURPOSE : The Movement) | With this single, Bieber became the first male artist since Justin Timberlake to achieve three number-ones in the US from an album.

His rough harsh childhood as compared to Justin\u2019s comfortable rich ruined childhood is a legend\u2026Eminem tried speaking with Justin to see what is problem is and he should behave well with his fans but Justin instead said Eminem doesn\u2019t know anything why he does so and Eminem soon understood he is nothing but a rich spoiled brat who thinks he is great as he as a huge fan following with a crazy no. of fans!!10.He once pushed a paparazzi Photographer and tried showing his body power and as the paparazzi photographer tumbled down and got up, Justin ran away in an ambulance saying his hand is injured as he was trying to push the photographer - i have nothing to say except for this:- \u201cSo delicate to be a man\u201d 11.The reasons behind hating Justin Bieber never stops - \u201cThe biggest reason to hate\u201d12.He was arrested over 16 times in total of his stardom and jailed over 16 times including cases of driving over people, killing them, insulting fans, throwing a beer bottle on a fan and injuring him, throwing eggs on fans, smoking marijuana, egging neighbor\u2019s house, vandalism, etc 13.He calls the Beatles a \u201ccrap band\u201d (c\u2019mon superhero\u2026 grow up) 14.He always sings about girls15.He thinks he is better and more popular than Michael Jackson 16.He is a racist and thinks black people are useless Dudes i think this is a pretty big reply and if i keep going on this will never stop\u2026 so think of yourself whether he is a man to be hated or loved ",
