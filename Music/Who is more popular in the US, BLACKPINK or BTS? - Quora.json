            "answer_text": "Thank you for the request! Undoubtedly I would have to say BTS\u2019 presence is far greater than Blackpink in the States. Now, this could be attributed to the fact that BTS for one has a lot more music they have released and a lot more promotion. BTS has also been extremely consistent in interacting with their fans on Twitter and creating a lot of content for them with shows like BTS Gayo, BTS RUN, and Bon Voyage. Blackpink only very recently have become much more interactive with personal Instagram accounts and so on. BTS also perhaps gained a lot of American attention through their covers of a lot of American music especially Jungkook and also due to their shoutouts and recommendations of American music they were quite vocal about. I feel BP being part of a much larger company that has a lot of policies in place are much more hesitant to share their opinions so openly on social media. The American award shows and also radio, YouTube and TV appearances definitely helped get the word out on who they were to the general American public versus Blackpink who hasn\u2019t had too much activity directly in America. These are largely the reasons why BTS are much more popular in the United States. However, Blackpink definitely has a large fanbase and potential in the US given they have more schedules and music so that they can keep the buzz about them much more consistent. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, thanks for the request! I guess BTS is more popular in the US than Black Pink. K-Pop was a genre which was mostly not known or heard in many countries including mine & I think BTS became a bit popular in the US around the WINGS era because of Blood, Sweat & Tears. This might have been the introduction to K-Pop in the US to many people. Then came Love Yourself: Her with DNA which too was their path on popularity increase but I guess their popularity rocketed when Love Yourself: Tear with FAKE LOVE got released. That was the time I think many people heard them as they hit No. 1 in Billboard Charts. Plus they also got a lot of attention when they won the Billboard Awards for Social Artist two times in a row, the first K-Pop group to win and as well they performed there which is also first for a K-Pop group. As talking of Black Pink, they are a newer group and I don\u2019t think they were popular when BTS was gaining it. Black Pink now is popular in US, it was a path given by BTS as like TWICE said. TWICE thank BTS for paving the way in the United States with When asked about BTS's recent appearance on 'The Ellen Show', Jihyo shared her thoughts about K-Pop being elevated to the global status thanks to BTS. She explained, \"BTS paved the way and gave [TWICE] an opportunity to become more known.\" Prior to that point, they had \"never thought that K-Pop would become so popular in America\". TWICE thank BTS for paving the way in the United States with K-Pop This is just my thought, it maybe right or wrong :) ",
