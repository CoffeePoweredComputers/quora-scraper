            "answer_text": "Which festival is it/which country is it in? I have general tips for all festivals, but if it's a UK festival I can help further. Firstly: drugs. Unless you are an experienced user of drugs DO NOT do them at festivals. I've worked as a steward at multiple festivals and by far the most frustrating (and common) medical issue we see is kids who had no idea what drug they were taking, what their alcohol limits were etc. Taking MDMA/Molly or ketamine for the first time is often not a great experience wherever you are; doing it in a field surrounded by strangers is not going to help. Even if you are experienced with drugs, be aware that a) the police will be around and drugs are illegal, and b) to know what you're taking. Don't buy drugs off people at festivals. On a less serious level: Pack tissues/toilet paper. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it in a field full of strangers.Prepare for all weathers - sun (sunscreen, cap, sunglasses), rain (waterproofs) and cold weather at night (sweaters).This one is key to enjoyment: don't rush around trying to see every band. You soon learn to accept at music festivals (above a certain size) that you will not see every band you want to. I have missed countless bands that I would have loved to see because another band was playing. Pick about 4 or 5 must see bands and then, for the rest of the time, go with your friends to see other bands. Hey, if you have time to see a bunch of awesome bands you want to see, great, but don't rush round trying to get it done. Just relax!Be polite to stewards! As mentioned, I've stewarded at festivals multiple times and it MAKES MY DAY when people say \u201chave a nice festival\u201d or whatever. Usually, we are working 6\u20138 hour shifts on our feet and most of the time we have been partying as hard as everyone else, and we are likely missing our favourite band!Otherwise, just relax, see the sights and enjoy!",

            "answer_text": "Outdoor festivals are amazing and great experiences and the best way to enjoy your first one is probably not to worry! But, also try and be prepared, take a good torch, toilet paper, wellies, bin bags, wet wipes, sun cream, allergy meds, pain killers and anti bac. Ensure you have somewhere to sleep, ie your own tent or you\u2019re sharing with someone you trust. Read the festival rules on prohibited items before you go, many festivals ban glass, aerosols over 250ml, air horns etc. Take the experience for what it is, don\u2019t try to cram everything in, just enjoy the stuff you can fit in - remember there\u2019s always another year or festival! Look after your cash, if you can store it somewhere safe. Ensure you can get home! ",
