            "answer_text": "I'm guessing you are referring to the opening line of Ben Brantley's (now) famous NYT review: \"Yes, it really is that good.\"  He continues:  Even I, one of the many critics who enthused about \u201cHamilton\u201d in February like a born-again convert in a revival tent, was beginning to think, \u201cEnough already.\u201d Then I saw the show at the Richard Rodgers. I am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit Broadway show. But \u201cHamilton,\u201d directed by Thomas Kail and starring Mr. Miranda, might just about be worth it \u2014 at least to anyone who wants proof that the American musical is not only surviving but also evolving in ways that should allow it to thrive and transmogrify in years to come. When A Chorus Line celebrated its 40th anniversary at The Public Theater this year, they brought back the surviving cast of the original production (which, like Hamilton, debuted at The Public before going to Bway). The cast of Hamilton performed ACL's signature song, One, then the ACL cast joined them on stage. The head of The Public said something like, \"Here at The Public, we believe we're changing the game of theater every day. And once every forty years, we hit it out of the park.\" That's what the people who eat, sleep and breathe theater for a living have said. Me, I'm just someone who goes to a show every now and again. I've seen maybe three dozen Bway shows over the course of my lifetime (my first two, which my mom took me to before I was a teen, were A Chorus Line and West Side Story, so the bar was set pretty high).  I'd say that the best thing I've seen on a stage is God of Carnage, a drama that starred James Gandolfini, Marcia Gay Harden, Jeff Daniels, and Hope Davis. Amazingly, as good as JG was, you could barely take your eyes off MGH. Amazing script, amazing acting. Mary Louise Parker was just as riveting in Heisenberg last month. But it seems unfair to compare dramas to musicals, so... I loved Book of Mormon (and had the fun of taking someone from Uganda, who was visiting New York for the first time -- a real treat, that). I saw Neil Patrick Harris in Hedwig so many times that I think there is a restraining order out against me. (And I didn't see any of the other people who played the role after he stepped down -- not even John Cameron Mitchell, who I saw perform it 20 years ago on Jane St.) I flew to NYC shortly after 9-11, and because so many people cancelled their trips right around that time, I was able to see Lane and Broderick in The Producers three times in five days. That was like watching Tim Conway and Harvey Korman trying to make one another laugh in the Carol Burnett show. Lane was his usual astonishing self, and they had such great chemistry. Lane was even better as Nathan Detroit in the Guys and Dolls revival. That ought to give you a sense of my tastes. So... Hamilton. I have never had a show infect me with ear worms like that one. I can't get the songs out of my head. Not just one or two them -- nearly all of them. (I'm not alone in this. Google 'Hamilton' and 'ear worm' and you'll get quite a few hits.) The choreography, the staging, the acting... it's all every bit as good as the music. Jonathan Groff's performance as King George makes you think the show's highlight comes too early in Act I. But then Daveed Diggs, who blew you away as Lafayette in Act I, returns as Jefferson in Act II. Oh my. I don't recommend seeing the show after abdominal surgery because you are guaranteed to tear your stitches laughing.  The soundtrack isn't out for few weeks, so the only way to satisfy the itch is to see the show. It opened August 5, and I have seen it enough times since then that I have blown through my 2015 theater budget. And my 2016 and 2017 theater budgets. If the soundtrack release gets delayed, I may need to seek a divorce attorney. [Pro tip: I have seen Javier Munoz, Lin-Manuel Miranda's understudy, perform twice. I have seen LMM perform it, uh, several more times than that. JM is the much stronger performer of the two. That said, if you see it only once, see it with LMM. It's his show, and his heart is all over his performance. But if you see it twice, be sure to catch JM.] To be fair, not everyone shares my love. My younger son, age 14, hates theater and especially hates musicals. As we were leaving, he immediately demanded to see it again (which we did just a few days ago). In contrast, when my 16 year old begged to leave at intermission, I allowed it (and resisted asking my husband about the possibility that there was some mix-up at the hospital when he was born). But read the twitter feeds of people who have seen the show, and ask how many people on the lottery line every day are there for a chance to see it a second or third time, and the near-unanimous consensus is,  \"Yes, it really is that good.\" And now if you'll excuse me, I need to go look on Stubhub...

            "answer_text": "I just saw \"Hamilton\" at the Richard Rogers theater.  I had heard so much hype about it that I was a little worried; it can't really be that good, I thought.  I saw it with all of the original Broadway cast with the exception of Andrew Rannells playing King George (he originated the role of \"Elder Price\" from the OBC of \"Book of Mormon\" & replaces Jonathan Groff.)  Rannells performs the role brilliantly, no question about it, so don't worry about that.  Listen up: Beg, borrow, steal, barter, sign up for the lottery, or do whatever it takes to get a ticket to this show. It's musical theater history. I will probably never see a better show in my lifetime. (Be sure to listen to the soundtrack before you go ... it's important. It will enhance your experience of the show by a factor of 10).  The music is insanely catchy.  I seem to have the songs playing in my head all the time, sort of on iPod shuffle.   There is not a single \"blah\" song in the whole production.  I'll pick one I like, such as the painful ballad \"It's Quiet Uptown\" and then immediately replace it with another favorite like \"The Ten Duel Commandments\", and then replace that with \"Hurricane.\" I simply can't think of another show that is as good as this one.  The songs, the cadences, the beat, the harmonies, the syncopation, the words.  Damn, LMM has a lot of words!  And he puts them together in the most charming, interesting, disarming, delightful ways.  But when the lyrics are married with the melodies, it's ear-candy. It's dope.  One simply can't get enough of it.   The production is brilliant in every respect. Sensational sound, staging, execution. The lyrics alone are perfect genius. One song, \"My Shot\" took Lin-Manuel Miranda 1 full year to write, because he wanted it to be absolutely perfect; he said it had to be \"unimpeachable.\" He nails it on that song. He's really a modern-day hip-hop Shakespeare.  I can just imagine the two of them collaborating on something ridiculously smart. The staging of \"Hamilton\" is so imaginative, the costumes are clever & beautiful, the choreography & dancers are brilliant.  The numbers are explosive in a heart-stopping way. Gorgeous, memorable songs, beautifully sung. I adored Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schulyer.  Leslie Odom, Jr. is insanely well-cast as Aaron Burr.  His voice is buttery-smooth, and bursts with simmering anger and emotion.  Lin-Manuel Miranda won a MacArthur Genius Grant award for this opus, and it is 1000% deserved. To see Mr. Miranda play Alexander Hamilton is a gift. (I hope to see a future production with Javier Mu\u00f1oz playing AH, as I hear that he's quite something.  Apparently Mr. Mu\u00f1oz plays the role at the Sunday matinee, but check listings before you go for updates.) I could see this show over and over and I already have tickets to see it next year. It's stunning. In a word:  magic. Recommend unequivocally.  (And I will repeat my caveat:  in my opinion,  you won't be half as wowed unless you listen to the soundtrack and understand what's being sung before you go.) ",
