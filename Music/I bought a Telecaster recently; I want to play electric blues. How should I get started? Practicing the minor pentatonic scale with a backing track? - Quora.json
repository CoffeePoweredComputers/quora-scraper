            "answer_text": "Listen to blues musicians. Listen to more blues musicians. Listen to other blues musicians. Listen to more blues. Attempt to play the blues. Look, if you really want to, there are (basically) two pentatonic scales: major and minor. Learn both. It\u2019ll take you five minutes. Then learn the Mixolydian mode, which also comes in handy for blues, and if you can be bothered, learn the blues scale, which is different again. Ten more minutes, tops. But steep yourself in actual blues, played by actual blues musicians. I assume you already like blues, since you want to learn to play it. I don\u2019t mean the blues as played by white musicians who\u2019ve learned it from studying black musicians. I mean the masters. Blues is a traditional music and you do not learn to play it by learning theory. You learn to play it by respecting the tradition and learning to play within it. If you absorb the tradition, you may get to extend it a tiny bit. Blues is not a matter of scales. Understanding blues means understanding an entire practice of music created by actual people in certain historical circumstances: Robert Johnson, Skip James, Son House, Memphis Minnie, Bessie Smith, Alberta Hunter, B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Guitar Slim, Johnny \u2018Guitar\u2019 Watson, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Muddy Waters, Albert Collins, Robert Cray. And many others. Forgive me if I digress for a second: It\u2019s easy for me to say what I\u2019m about to say, because I\u2019ve studied some theory and have learned to read music and yadda yadda yadda. But the theoretical knowledge I have, I studied fairly late in life. Most of what I know about music is practical musical knowledge: if someone were to ask me how to do a hammer-on, my instinct is to show them, not attempt to describe the sequence of muscle movements. I feel like people think that learning theory is learning music. It isn\u2019t. The royal road to becoming better at music is through musical practice, and theory can be a guide to practice, but the idea that studying theory alone will make you better at music-making, is like thinking that looking at a map of a country is the same as visiting the country. In the case of blues, a music which came out of the suffering of black Americans at a particularly low point in their history, I feel like it\u2019s kind of insulting to blues musicians to think that being able to play blues is just a matter of knowing scales. I can play blues, a bit, but I wouldn\u2019t in public, because I feel it\u2019s ridiculous to behave as though I, a middle-class white Irish guy, is speaking from the place where the blues come from. I can produce a reasonable facsimile of blues, but would I want to get up on a stage and charge people to hear me do it? God, no. If I were to share a stage with a real blues musician, I would seek to find some sort of music that we could both feel at home in. But would I attempt to imitate Hubert Sumlin, a guitarist whose style I\u2019ve studied hard? No. So, by all means, learn a few scales, but then listen to the blues, and I mean really listen to it, and then learn to play it. And, if you are where the blues comes from, then you could be a blues musician. But if you aren\u2019t, then you will be richer for having studied it, but you will still be faced with the need to come up with your own music. Good luck. And enjoy listening. One last thing: Telecaster? Good choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Congrats on your telecaster. For something looking so plain and designed to be made economically in the 1950s, it is an amazingly versatile and great sounding guitar. The blues scale is the key thing to know as you have said. You also need to work on accurate string bending to be able to raise the pitch accurately by half and whole notes at the right time. Also work on vibrato. The cool thing about the blues is that one note played at the right time and right way really enhances the song and sounds great. What is the \"right way\"? Well holding the note out or cutiing it short is one factor. Lots of vibrato or none? Bend 1/2 or whole note.? So start with trying a note or a note with a bend out along with the jam track. Then 2 note riffs and 3 note riffs. Get them in the right place so that they sound good in the tune and you are on your way. Timing, note placement and expression of play is more important than speed or quantity for the blues. ",
