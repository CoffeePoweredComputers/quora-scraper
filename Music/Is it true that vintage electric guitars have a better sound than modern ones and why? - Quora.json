            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll say vintage guitars sound and feel different. And I\u2019ll also say that there are many great modern guitars that also sound and play great. And they are different than vintage. I\u2019ll take a stab at defining something that\u2019s nebulous and hard to put your finger on. A nice vintage guitar that\u2019s well played feels smooth and broken in like a pair of your favorite jeans. It\u2019s just that someone\u2019s knocked off the the rough edges for you. They don\u2019t feel new anymore. There\u2019s not a sharp edge in sight. It\u2019s not limited to guitars but about anything we handle. I have older ratchet wrench\u2019s I\u2019ve had since the eighties and they are simply more comfortable to handle. Chances are I could blindfold some one. Hand the the exact same model of wrench and they will be able to tell which ones new and which ones old. Even if their hands are calloused. But the older wrench\u2019s are not visibly worn all that much. One feels sharper and harder and the other feels softer to the touch. The broken in wrench is simply more comfortable to hold. So is a well played guitar. Smooth is conductive to playing without distraction. Edges and corners are noticeable and detract from your playing. They for a lack of a better term intrude. Weaker magnets are a part of things. Stronger magnets are more punchy. More attack oriented. Aged magnets are slightly smoother and warmer. This makes a vintage guitar sound slightly more even and compressed. Warmer. More of your playing technique comes through. Lower out put pickups mean that your likely to turn the amp up a just a hair to compensate. And now several things maybe happing. A touch more compression on clean tones. Or a bit more grit on distorted tones. You get the attack but being weaker chances are you may hear the individual notes of a chord sustaining cleanly as the amp drops back back into a cleaner mode. The net effect of this is that your using a little more of the amps actual voice since your driving it harder. Your hearing more of the guitar itself as it compresses slightly. It sounds better both clean And dirty. In other words is more dynamic and show cases Your playing. Nuances pop out that you may not have heard before. Or may have been seeking. It\u2019s hard not to like something that feels great in hand. Showcases your playing and also lets you get more of what you love out of your amp. As guitarists we take a lot of heat for playing to loud ;) But I suspect what most people are seeking is nuance. It\u2019s difficult to think of a raging Marshall as subtle ;) but if that\u2019s what it takes to make your playing pop or stand out then indeed it\u2019s all about subtle and nuance. This is also why the older more expressive players tend to gravitate towards non master volume amps and slightly less gain than younger players. Regardless of what what you play and play through everyone wants to hear more of whatever it is they are trying to say. Vintage guitars just tend to do this better and feel more comfortable and broken in. I\u2019ve not touched on things like wood that\u2019s more stable and seasoned. Or the fact someone\u2019s played it for decades. Speakers break in. So do guitars. It\u2019s hard to believe a 8\u20139 lb chunk of wood would break in. But they seem too. Those that curate museum instruments recognizes the fact they do need to be played and arrange for that to happen. It\u2019s just more obvious on a violin. It might be myth or mojo. But if you play a bunch of vintage guitars you will notice they just sound and feel better. Or different. Your personal style may be enhanced by a newer guitars tone. Not everyone is seeking vintage sounds. Many do because our ears are accustomed to the sounds these instruments made when new. Those sounds are still there. The palette simply seems to broaden with time. ",

            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t always. But there are a lot of factors at work. First off, \u201cgood playing\u201d means a lot of different things to different people. For some, the shape of the neck alone can be a deal-breaker, even if for someone else, the instrument is utterly perfect. There\u2019s also the fact that any instrument that was built many years ago, let\u2019s say the decade around 1960, if such an instrument still survives, there\u2019s a good chance that it was very playable when it was made and care was taken to ensure that it remained in good playable condition. Those that were made at the same time that haven\u2019t survived until now were taken out of circulation due to the fact that they were damaged, ruined, trashed, or otherwise discarded. So the percentage of \u201cgood guitars from that year to bad guitars of that year\u201d is going to increase over time, especially if the good guitars are recognized as being so good and are well cared for and maintained. There are also a lot of ambiguous values assigned to older instruments. For example, knowing that your personal guitar god played a \u201964 Strat, you\u2019d find yourself drawn to and wanting one, hoping to at least experience something similar to playing their clearly special instrument. The fact that probably over half of the Stratocasters made in 1964 are gone, well, that just raises the stakes and desirability of one. The fact is that I\u2019ve held and played some guitars that were the same make, model and year as \u201cthe classics\u201d, and sometimes the guitar in my hands was a work of art, and sometimes it was a piece of crap. Of course the person with the work of art knew exactly what they possessed and the person with the piece of crap still wanted to get top dollar out of their \u201cinvestment\u201d. There\u2019s nothing magical about older guitars, each one is going to have its own personal history, its scars, provenance and story to tell. It may be an utter joy to play (for someone who decides it is) or it could be unable to even tune properly. Modern guitars are made using methods and to tolerances that luthiers 50 or more years ago couldn\u2019t even dream of, as a result new guitars are going to be much more consistent than those from previous eras and that consistency is going to hover around a higher standard of play-ability than those earlier guitars were built to. But they do have a mystique and aura around them. That much is undeniable. I mean, just as an example, who wouldn\u2019t want to at least check out a \u201957 Les Paul Custom, even if they\u2019d have to remortgage their house in order to take it from the shop? ",
