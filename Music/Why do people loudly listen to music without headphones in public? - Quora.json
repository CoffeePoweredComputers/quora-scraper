            "answer_text": "Often it is innocuous in intent and unthinking. Sometimes, it\u2019s a passive aggressive assault. Anyone living in NY City in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s and \u201cproletarian\u201d enough to regularly use the trains and buses would realize this. Typically, a young male would board public transit carrying or even cradling a \u201cboom box\u201d on his shoulder. This a monstrous radio/tape/speaker combo the size of a hefty overnight suitcase. It would blast cacaphonous, malphonic, jarring music, often well passing performance specs of the cheesy speakers. (This is not about busking musicians by the way. I may or may not like what they play but I admire their legitimate hustle and enterprising spirit. They are trying to please, hopefully for a small, voluntary quid pro quo). With the weaponized boom box situation, passengers would just shrink and endure, especially in the 70\u2019s when crime rates were pretty high in NYC. It was very much an \u201cI dare you\u2026\u201d moment on the part of the perpetrator. Those days have mostly passed. but it\u2019s possible to see a similar scenario outdoors in public places, with small groups of people enjoying music at sometimes annoying volumes. I can deal with that. It\u2019s nothing like becoming a de facto acoustic hostage in a public conveyance which you paid for. The latest incarnation of boom box pestilence isn\u2019t a boom box at all, and it\u2019s really not so new. It\u2019s cars cruising slowly through residential side streets playing preternaturally loud stereos. They have high end sound with bass woofers capable of rattling windows in adjacent homes and perhaps triggering small earthquakes. Gabriel\u2019s Horn has nothing on these. Why would they blast their sonic poison while \u201ccruising\u201d at such slow speeds where people live (and at all hours, too) ? How does this enhance enjoyment of the music? ",

            "answer_text": "I listen to Future Funk and Synthwave in public at conventions because japanese, choppy remix samplers would be somewhat popular and fitting.When somebody wants to make a joke with me, I pull out my phone and find songs that I resonate with or ones that would fit well with a joke I heard. Otherwise I keep to myself because I\u2019m listening to songs about detailed psychotic breakdowns, detailed sex, instrumentals at extreme speeds and the kind of funk to rock the frames off subwoofers.
