            "answer_text": "If it's in 5.1 audio format, there's a good chance that the dialogue is isolated on one or more of the audio tracks. Any decent multitrack audio-editing software, or even video-editing, should be able to let you manipulate the tracks individually. You should be able to export just the track you want, or the entire video clip after deleting the audio tracks you don't want. You can either simply look at the waveform of each track, or mute all but one track and play the audio, to determine which track(s) have the dialogue. I know Adobe Audition and Premiere can do all this, in terms of Adobe products. ",

            "answer_text": "iZotope RX 6 Advanced has a feature called Dialogue Isolate. It uses machine learning to identify dialog in a track and then removes everything else. It excels with noisy backgrounds, but I tried it on an interview piece that had music behind it. I needed to use the interview in a video over a different music track. While DI didn\u2019t completely remove the music (maybe 95% gone), over the new music track there was no hint of the old music. RX is almost magic! It\u2019s my go-to noise reduction suite. ",
