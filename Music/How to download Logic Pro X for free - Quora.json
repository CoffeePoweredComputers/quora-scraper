Logic is one of the most affordable DAW\u2019s and comes with nearly all plug-ins and tools that you need to record and produce music in (almost) any genre. Think of software as any oher instrument; You don\u2019t walk into a music store and just walk out with a guitar or a keyboard., you pay for it. Do the same with the software you need. ",

Well, I don't recommend downloading it from torrent websites since It is illegalYou won\u2019t be able to update logic pro. You will have to work on the downloaded setup. To upgrade you will have to download an updated setup from the internet and install it again on your computer.It\u2019s buggy. The downloaded software carries bug issues. Though it\u2019s rare, you will find some weird things happening sometimes while using the application like a midi note will show in the piano roll but when you hit play there is no sound.Before downloading it from the torrent, do check if the set up is compatible with your current OS. Best of luck for making some good music in future. ",
