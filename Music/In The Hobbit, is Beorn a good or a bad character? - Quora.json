            "answer_text": "Thank you Ender for the A2A! That depends on who is doing the asking. For a Man, elf, dwarf, wizard or hobbit who minded his or her manners, spun an entertaining yarn and didn't threaten his animals, bees or way of life \u2026 Beorn could be a wonderful friend and ally. For orcs, wargs or other enemies who drove his ancestors from the Misty Mountains, fewer beings in Middle-earth could have been more \u2026 bad. Like many frontier and pioneer types making a precarious living in a challenging land Beorn (Rohirric: \"Bear, Warrior\") was preternauturally suspicious of others until they proved their worth to him. He also paid far greater attention to actions than words. Even Gandalf's masterful introduction of Thorin and Company didn't completely persuade Beorn to accept their provenance. \u201cWell, now I know who you are, or who you say you are.\u201d [1]  Similarly, Beorn was a believer in the ancient tribal dictum 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.' Once he discovered that Thorin and Company were on the run from his ancient foes, his opinion of them underwent a rapid transformation: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d \u201cTo tell you the truth, we have lost our luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather in need of help, or at least of advice. I may say we have had rather a bad time with goblins in the mountains.\u201d \u201cGoblins?\u201d said the big man less gruffly. \u201cO ho, so you\u2019ve been having trouble with them have you?\u201d [2] In more than one way we can think of Beorn as being elemental, a 'true Neutral' in the Dungeons amd Dragons alignment respect, and his worldview bore an uncanny resemblance to that expressed by another elemental being \u2014 Fangorn \u2014 who said \u201cI am not altogether on anybody\u2019s side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me \u2026\u201d. [3]. Indeed, his descendants the Beornings were a mixed lot themselves: \u201c\u2026 it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear\u2019s shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength.\u201d [4] Before their sojourn in the eaves of Mirkwood, Gandalf cautioned Thorin and Company not to believe that they truly understood the skin-changer and his motivations: \u201cBeorn may be your friend, but he loves his animals as his children. You do not guess what kindness he has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if you tried to take them into the forest.\u201d [5] One aspect of Beorn is crystal clear: he was a terrible foe in a battle. He singlehandedly stalked and slew orcs and Wargs at night near their stronghold in the Misty Mountains. \u201cWhat did you do with the goblin and the Warg?\u201d asked Bilbo suddenly. \u201cCome and see!\u201d said Beorn, and they followed round the house. A goblin\u2019s head was stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. Beorn was a fierce enemy.\u201d [6] Much like the literary figure Bjorn the Man-Bear in the Old Norse saga from which Tolkien stole him, Beorn was all but invincible in battle, causing tremendous damage while experiencing none himself: \u201cBeorn stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of the fray. Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him.\u201d [7]  Not bad for the love child of Radagast the Brown, huh? Ultimately it is up to each of us to determine whether we view Beorn \u2014 a man capable of heartwarming acts of generosity and horrible acts of homicidal violence \u2014 as good or bad. I know how I feel about him.

            "answer_text": "I would contend Beorn is good in the sense of the Tolkien mythology in that he serves the natural order of things. He is not an product of corruption like Orcs, Wargs, or any of the Maia that Morgoth led astray. He has no agenda of domination nor does he overtly destroy anything in Middle Earth that was part of the song of Eru. He certainly is a mystery even though his existence in the story is clearly influenced by Beowulf and other Anglo Saxon/Norse mythology. Beowulf had the strength of 30 men in his grip and Beorn is a towering figure, by Bilbo\u2019s description in the neighborhood of 12 feet all. At a minimum Gandalf has great respect for Beorn and possibly even fears him. His warning to the Dwarves to return the animals at the borders of Mirkwood testifies that Gandalf believes Beorn could destroy Thorin\u2019s entire company if so angered to. Beorn is kindly enough when humored and more than willing to aid those who have shown common cause against the Orcs and Wargs of the Misty Mountains. He is clearly the u-catastrophe Tolkien dearly loved at the Battle of Five Armies in that his sudden arrival turns certain defeat into victory. I liken him to the Incredible Hulk of the Marvel Universe in that he is a peaceable character in normal circumstances but is also a character of Wrath. And his Wrath was directed at forces that were evil in nature. In the the same way as the Hulk it seems as his wrath and power are interconnected and given the proper stimulus quite staggering in it\u2019s destructive capability. He was capable of army shattering destruction at the climax of the Battle of Five Armies. However I would venture that his in a Hero in the sense that he is over concerned about the wellness and affairs of that which lies beyond his sphere of concern. ",
