            "answer_text": "There are a variety of mechanical or electronic reasons that a record player may run slightly fast, but these almost always are or were a problem with low-cost record players. When record players were powered by AC motors, where the speed of the motor was fixed by the AC power frequency, an incorrect gearing ratio (possibly due to parts wearing out) could cause a high speed. Later, budget record players (such as all-in-one stereos from the 80s and the low cost turntable mechanisms that go into many brands of inexpensive record players today) used DC motors, and the speed was adjustable by a potentiometer inside the unit. Errors made by the production staff at the factory could have resulted in a turntable that runs at the wrong speed. I would recommend going about your turntable issue as follows; first, determine the value and quality of the turntable. If you were to take this to a repair shop, would the cost of the repairs be greater than the monetary value of the unit? If the device is what people typically think of as a \u201crecord player,\u201d that is, the turntable mechanism, amplifier, and speaker are all in one self-contained unit, then the answer is definitely \u201cyes.\u201d Don\u2019t waste money trying to have this repaired. Second, look at the quality of the design of what you have. Any type of record player or turntable that uses a ceramic cartridge is of low quality and will cause more rapid deterioration of records than a precision turntable with a magnetic cartridge. The inexpensive \u201cbad\u201d record players and turntables include: most console all-in-one sound systems from the 1940s the 1970s, budget stereos (most popular in the 1970s) with external automatic record changer turntables, all-in-one stereos (most popular in the 1980s), record players designed for use by children, and modern record players that don\u2019t have precise adjustments for tracking force. Some might object to my slamming of vintage console sound systems; at the time that these units were introduced, they could be costly, and they were considered advanced consumer products. However, cartridge and turntable technology has progressed since then. At this point, if you have established that you have a quality turntable (such as one made for the component high fidelity or professional market), then have a repair shop service it. Otherwise, don\u2019t risk damaging your records. For the educational value, you could watch the YouTube videos made by user radiotvphononut. A number of the record players that he services run audibly fast. He also states in a number of his videos that many of these record players were never designed to be precision machines, and as such, they should not be used to play highly valuable records. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t much you can do. If your turntable has a speed control, it might be dirty or defective. You could try spraying a small amount of WD-40 on the mechanism and then switch it quickly between 33 and 45 a few times. If your turntable uses a belt (do a Google search of your turntable brand and model if you\u2019re not sure,) a new belt might help. However, a worn belt would usually make the platter turn slower because of a loosening grip. You could also try a heavy record weight (they\u2019re round and slide onto the spindle) to see if it slows down the rotation. They can be crazy expensive, though. If you have something that is small but heavy, you could try placing it on the record label as a test to see if it helps. ",
