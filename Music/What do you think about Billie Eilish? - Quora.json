            "answer_text": "A while back I was food shopping and I came across a chartreuse-haired wonder with dramatic black highlights and a don\u2019t-fuck-with-me aura. She was elevated above the masses on some sort of platform boots, and her long green talons were wrapped around an orange like the Evil Queen clutching a poisoned apple. She raised the orange to the front of her face to appraise it\u2014a witch gazing into a crystal ball. I decided she was fabulous and moved on. You think anyone can pull off chartreuse? Forget about it. Chartreuse kills or empowers, depending. Chartreuse is for the brave. All others need not apply. A week went by and I spied another chartreuse girl, black ends, big mismatched boots. Then another. Is something going on? Eventually the name Billie Eilish landed in my tinnitus laden ear like a butterfly resting on a colostomy bag. Something was going on! I proceeded to google: A figure dressed in polluted yellow rips through a similarly colored screen, removes a lump of something large and creepy from her mouth and hands it to a stoic bouncer type. She bops around a bit and, in a living-dead voice that could hardly be bothered, she explains \u201cI\u2019m the bad type/ make your Momma sad type/make your girlfriend mad tight/might seduce your dad type...\u201d It was love at first video. In the mysterious way of the internet, my Quora feed became flooded with Billie Eilish babble, mostly old people bitching. I\u2019ll paraphrase, \u2018She\u2019s just a kid, what does a kid know of pain? She thinks she so special, she ain\u2019t so special. She\u2019s nothing but a pretentious faux-angst filled privileged little brat. She\u2019s a corporate creation, built out of butterfly tears and Marilyn Manson farts. This is what\u2019s wrong with music today, ya know? God I miss the Big Bopper.\u2019 She was negated because she came from money. Then the idea that she came from money was challenged. This went back and forth for a while, then petered off to another accusation of faux-angst pretension. The idea that money and pain can exist in the very same person was not broached. Well, I\u2019m here to broach it. Rich people feel pain too. There. I\u2019m done. Now I\u2019ll broach other shit as well. Here\u2019s a shocking fact: if you\u2019re over twenty years old Billie Eilish is not singing to you. If your balls are hitting toilet water or your tits are flatter than day old pancakes you are not her intended audience. At 61, I\u2019m not either. I can flap my saggy geriatric jaw till it falls off, but there\u2019s no way to construct my words into any kind of cultural relevance because none of this is about me. The understanding that my opinion is irrelevant to the audience of a new pop-star is an important one. More often than not it stops me from being an asshole. \u201cMadonna is a one hit wonder.\u201d Yeah, I sure called that one. So I should probably shut up now and I will\u2014tomorrow. In the meantime, I feel the need to proclaim my appreciation for Billie Eilish. I think her videos are captivating, lyrics provocative, and I\u2019m an absolute sucker for the droll zombie persona she packages her pain in. \u201cDuh.\u201d To me, this George Sanders-Ian Curtis-Peter Noone hybrid is completely new. I guess we could locate her origins in goth, but goth was chilly, holding itself at a remove from the audience as well as life itself. Billie Eilish has the capacity to thaw. Have you seen any of that concert footage? She\u2019s your new best friend, reaching out to touch your hand, holding a microphone over a crowd of kids who know every single word to every single song and will voice them at will as long as they can stop crying long enough to do so. She projects authenticity; when she sings I believe her. I believe she\u2019s been through a boatload of shit, and I believe she contains the impulse that some survivors contain, namely, to be of help. I imagine Billie Eilish was concocted in the minds of a bunch of corporate suits, as well as in the blackened mind of an alienated kid and her talented brother. All sorts of contrived choices and personal mishaps go into a product roughly labeled art. After all, art is series of decisions made, as well as guts spilled. But why does that discount her? I\u2019ve got news for you, conceived in a boardroom or not, the Monkees were great. Have you listened to Pleasant Valley Sunday lately? It\u2019ll knock your socks off. I\u2019m pretty sure that if I was sixteen I\u2019d be in that audience: mouthing songs, enthralled as a refreshingly lumpy girl with ever morphing hair spells out her pain\u2014our pain, as if we were the first people in the world to really feel it. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like to be a teenager. And if you\u2019re too old or jaded to remember any of that, let those of us who do remind you. Disclaimer: It\u2019s been pointed out that I spend much of the post discounting the opinion of oldsters while I, as an oldster, proceed to spout my opinion. Ok, ok, there\u2019s a contradiction there. Leave me alone. Anyway, I might have the body of an old man but I have the soul of a sixteen year old girl. Ask anybody. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm torn about her, in multiple regards. As a father of two teenage girls, I've been exposed to Eilish, and I've also seen several interviews with her. First off, I think she's a damn good singer. She did a Carpool Karaoke with James Corden and she has a beautiful voice with a tremendous amount of control and emotion. BUT\u2026it doesn't show at all in her recorded music because the production and mixing horribly hides any of her talent. I honestly think that's a damn shame. Second, she seems like a very good, down-to-earth kid\u2026BUT, she's been totally manufactured, which obscures that. Her parents are both musicians and her mother was an actor; she's not exactly just some random kid. Interviews with her and her mother reveal that before (or immediately after) putting her first song online, they hired image consultants to meticulously craft her image. In light of that, I think the baggy clothes have nothing to do with hiding her body and making it less of a conversation point; the baggy clothes have done the exact opposite, turning her body into a topic of discussion (genius marketing move). Her hair color? Topic of discussion. Her sexuality? Topic of discussion. Everything about her has been designed to trigger discussion, much like Lady Gaga. It all just seems artificial. Finally, I do want to praise her for overcoming and working through her Tourette's Syndrome. I was suspicious that this was just another marketing move, but once I saw older videos of her interviews, I could see the telltale tics that mark her as having about my level of Tourette's. I can imagine that it would be difficult to operate in public, especially on stage, with that condition, so I have to give my respect to her. I hope that, in the coming years, she moves away from this \u201cBad Guy\"/\u201dBury A Friend\" type of music to something that can showcase real songwriting and real music. ",
