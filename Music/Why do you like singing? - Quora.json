            "answer_text": "Singing can be extremely beautiful if done correctly, whether performing solo, in a chorus, or small group. When it comes to choir singing, I love harmonies. I've always loved harmonies ever since I joined my first chorus in he first grade (it was a church children\u2019s chorus, but this was where I developed my passion for singing.) All my life, I've been an alto, so we sing most of the harmonies. Harmonies, in my eyes, have their own sense of beauty. They add charm to the melody of a song, and when a harmony is perfected, you can't help but feel amazed at the sounds. Singing, no matter what form, allows you to unleash a new side to you. Anyone can speak, but the ability to make listeners feel something with your voice enables you to feel a small sense of pride. Now, solo singing is quite different. When one sings in a chorus, they must be uniform and they must sing the notes just as they\u2019re written. Of course, this form has its own sense of beauty. But solo singing? In most cases, you can decide how you want to sing something. You have control over your voice, the timbre you use, how long you hold your notes out for, etc. I love choir singing, but solo singing is my forte. I love having the ability to control how I sing a piece of music because I feel as if I have a choice in the matter. Overall, I love singing because I feel as if I'm inspiring people with my voice. The people listening, whether consciously or subconsciously, hear and interpret your words. Your voice has the ability to spark a certain emotion within a person. Being able to inspire someone with your voice is simply a spectacular feeling, which is why I continue to sing to this day. ",

            "answer_text": "Why Do I Sing? I sing because it is the one activity in which my body, mind and spirit unite in a creative fashion. In my life, the dual objective of art- self-expression and communication- is realized most effectively in the act of singing- specifically, jazz singing. On an external instrument, such as saxophone or piano, one has visual and tactical points of reference to lead them to the next sound. No such advantage is afforded the singer, who must feel each note before it is sung, while sorting through the many options- tone, attack, vibrato, volume, dialect and others- to achieve the desired effect. I enjoy the act of sharing ideas and feelings, powered by breath. \u2028I enjoy the act of evoking images and emotions through sounds (and words, yes, but often only sounds).\u2028 I love the collective improvisation found in acoustic jazz, when we share the duties of establishing rhythm and harmony, when form becomes elastic and every solo is never really solo, with all the input coming from the other players- supporting, then leading; responding but also suggesting. The understanding that what was just played could never- should never- be played exactly that way ever again challenges me to allow new ideas to come through me each time we perform a standard, or one of my songs, or the blues. Singing is the manner in which I touch the world, the manner in which I express how the world has touched me. ",
