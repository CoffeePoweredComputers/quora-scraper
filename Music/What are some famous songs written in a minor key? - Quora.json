            "answer_text": "During the Great Depression of the 1930s, popular songs in a minor key, although still relatively rare, became more common (e.g., My Funny Valentine, Brother Can You Spare a Dime, Let\u2019s Face the Music and Dance, Puttin\u2019 on the Ritz). Other songs that come to mind: I Love Paris, I Didn\u2019t Know What Time it Was, St. James Infirmary, Big Spender. In some of their later songs, The Beatles also developed an attraction to minor keys: Eleanor Rigby, Fixing a Hole, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite. (\u201cHelp\u201d starts with a minor chord; and the use of a minor scale with raised fourth degrees lends the intro [verse] of \u201cGirl\u201d an unexpectedly klezmer-esque quality.) Note, however, that many of the above songs inevitably shift to the major mode at some point; ending a piece in a minor key was still a highly unusual move in classic-era popular music. ",
