            "answer_text": "No. Well\u2026 yes. Sort of. It\u2019s hard to quantify. Kurt Cobain rather famously struggled with the mainstream success his band Nirvana achieved after releasing Nevermind in 1991. He had fully embraced his bands earlier identity as part of the \u2018alternative\u2019 movement and clearly seemed to feel a sense of belonging to that particular musical sub-culture. However Cobain\u2019s songwriting instincts were more commercial and more \u201cpop\u201d than most alternative acts and as such he crafted an album full of ear worming hooks and melodies that rapidly grew his audience. Cobain\u2019s response to this was a mix of gratitude that the band could now earn a good living from music and a sense of unease that his audience was no longer the \u2018alternative\u2019 crowd but was infact the same music fans who would attend Guns n\u2019Roses and Bon Jovi shows. Cobain's discomfort was more to do with his own perception of himself and his band and how they had positioned themselves as something \u201cdifferent\u201d from the mainstream rock bands who were played on the radio in those days. In particular Cobain was troubled by having his audiences filled with people who didn\u2019t share his values. Cobain even put this sense of unease into his lyrics. He's the one Who like all our pretty songs And he likes to sing along And he likes to shoot his gun But he don't know what it means Don't know what it means (In Bloom - 1991) And his album notes: At this point I have a request for our fans. If any of you in any way hate homosexuals, people of different color, or women, please do this one favor for us - leave us the fuck alone! Don't come to our shows and don't buy our records. Incesticide Album Notes I have heard that in the latter part of his all too brief career Cobain eased up and realised that if he had this large audience then he could educate them about what he believed and quite possibly he used that idea to rationalise and justify his career to himself. Nirvana\u2019s forth album \u2018In Utero\u2019 (1993) was written and recorded to be very different from Nevermind in an attempt to shrink the bands audience back to something Cobain was more comfortable with. However again Cobain\u2019s pop instincts won out and it is claimed that he had the album remixed and remastered before release in order to make it more radio friendly. In the end Cobain\u2019s attitude towards his audience was merely a symptom of the mental health issues which would eventually claim his life in early 1994. Even his suicide note refereed to how he was \u201cfaking it onstage\u201d and how unfair that was on his audience. Sadly the only person who really cared about those issues was himself. ",

He was also shy & felt the attention took away from the music. I saw him interact with fans when nobody really knew him / Nitvana & when they were the biggest band in the world. If you came at him & were ass, then you probably got what you give. Your not going to have a great experience with everyone you meet. He was as great Dad, friend , human who just happens to make an incredible impact with his band. ",

Maybe he found in it what he wants i guess\u2026\u2026 He was a lucky lost guy. There were no other reasons except the drug problem. He was content person actually, with his new home and daughter Francis Bean but i\u2019m not sure with Courtney Love.

I think no one cared to hear or listen to him close enough to hear his true message of his end. ",
