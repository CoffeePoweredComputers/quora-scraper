            "answer_text": "The very same elements that make riffs like the ones found in songs like Johnny B. Goode, Satisfaction, Foxey Lady, Purple Haze, Won\u2019t get fooled again, Substitute, Helter Skelter, Whole Lotta Love, Smoke on the Water, Mississippi Queen, Iron Man, Cat Scratch Fever, Back in Black, Crazy Train, Let\u2019s Go Crazy, Barracuda, Rainbow In The Dark, Enter Sandman, Smells like Teen Spirit, contain the answers you seek. What are those key elements that constitute a good, or great guitar riff? Does it immediately grab your ear? Is it catchy and memorable? Does it have a groove or pulse that makes you want to move body, or compel you to pull out the old air guitar and start jumping around like a monkey? Can you sing it in your head, even if you haven\u2019t heard it in years? A good guitar riff is akin to a tribal loop. Not too long, and not too short. You\u2019ll know it when you hear it, but great guitar riffs are hooks unto themselves, because they hook the listeners attention into its hypnotic tractor beam, so to speak. Without knowing your knowledge and experience on guitar, as well as your general musical knowledge, I think I\u2019ll stop here. Were you one of my guitar students, those elements would be further expanded upon with guitarist exclusive vernacular, techniques, devices, tonal elements and the like. Happy Riffing. ",

Many, many electric guitarists forget about rhythm. They think that riffs and solos are all about how fast you can wiggle your fingers. No, particularly with riffs, it\u2019s about really sitting in the groove. One (under-appreciated) example: the main riff from \u201cCan\u2019t You Hear Me Knocking\u201d. Keith Richards is the king of riffs although he\u2019s hardly the king of solos. Listen to how that particular riff really sits in the groove of the song, with that bluesy, back of the beat quality to it. Keith always did way more for the Stones\u2019 rhythm section than Bill Wyman ever did. ",

Still people need music- go for it- dont quit your day job yet! ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: You know. You just know. ;-) Longer answer: Pretty much the same as the other commenters. A guitar riff is a good example of a 'hook'; that is, something in the song that catches the listener's attention, i.e., it 'hooks' them. Think of songs that start with a strong riff: 'Smoke On The Water', 'Satisfaction', 'Day Tripper', 'Johnny B. Goode', etc. You KNOW the song INSTANTLY! It pulls you into it RIGHT AWAY! And the song builds from there! And then, you pick up your guitar and try to play it; because the riff is fairly simple, you can do it, and you get a sense of accomplishment! Honest. Listen to Beethoven's 5th Symphony; \u201cDa-da-da-DAAAH!\u201d is a killer riff, even if it's NOT rock music! If you want to create a good riff, come up with something CATCHY! ",

For me, it is about the rhythm, progression, structure, tone and \u201cpepper\u201d that each individual brings to their style. Mostly listen to metal and 40\u2019s tunes myself. Good rhythm guitar players are king. Think Malcolm Young - AC/DC - arguably one of the best. ",
