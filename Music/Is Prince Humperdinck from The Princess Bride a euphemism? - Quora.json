            "answer_text": "Not a euphemism \u2014 an allusion. It\u2019s a fact, albeit a little-known one, that Prince Humperdinck of The Princess Bride fame got his name from Engelbert Humperdinck. What\u2019s up for debate, however, between the scholars of Simon Morgenstern vs. those of William Goldman is which Humperdinck the Prince is based on. Was it Engelbert Humperdinck (1854\u20131921), the German romantic composer of the opera Hansel and Gretel? This is advocated by the former group, since the 19th century was full of swashbuckling and fairy tales.Or rather Engelbert Humperdinck (born Arnold George Dorsey in 1936), the English pop singer who adopted the composer\u2019s name as a marketing ploy? This is suggested by the latter pundits, since Dorsey and Goldman have about the same age.If you were so kind to sponsor my trip, I will travel to Guilder and find out. After all, everybody knows Guilder and Florin lie roughly \u201cbetween where Germany and Sweden are today\u201d. Just across the border from where I live.  ",
