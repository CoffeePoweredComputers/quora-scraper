            "answer_text": "These type of futile comparisons, never lead to anything productive. Kohli vs Sachin, Federer vs Nadal, Sonu Nigam vs Udit Narayan etc. questions like these mostly are asked by insecure fans who want some assurance that the artist they have revered for so long is indeed the best among all. Like getting an affirmation from someone will somehow calm their soul. I have been one of those fans but now I have graduated to maturity. However, since I am here I will try to answer the question. And in this question we can have a clear answer if we frame the question in different way. First of all, 'greatest' is a pretty subjective term and unless one defines how one measures greatness, the term by itself does not help at all. And the answer will change everytime depending upon your yardstick. For ex. let's say someone asks which is the greatest band in rock history. Now, if one defines greatness by how influential a band has been, then the answer is 'Beatles'. And I am sure not many will disagree. But if one resorts to another measure like which had best discography, talent then we will have many answers and none of them will be wrong. So we will replace 'greatest' by 'best'. To me \u2018best\u2019 seems more objective as it gives an impression that we are talking about singing only. Now for a singer to be the best he should have solid technique and versatility. In both departments he should be at top or near the top. And we are specifically talking about hindi cinema. So if one asks 'Who is best playback singer in hindi cinema?\u2019. The clear answer is Mohd. Rafi. And I will support this by giving out some facts. Manna dey was the best, when it came to classical singing , at that time in hindi cinema world. However he was seldom used as a lead singer as composers preferred Rafi\u2019s voice for male stars at that time. Imagine the pain Manna Dey must have felt losing songs to Rafi for songs he knew was more than capable enough to sing. Despite all that , Dadasahab Phalke awardee Manna Dey clearly stated that Rafi is indeed the best playback singer India has ever produced. However he also said that Kishore was most talented among all the singers. But being untrained he had his limitations. Does talent solely counts or the final product? I will leave it up to you to decide. SD Burman always had a soft corner for Kishore Kumar and he was very fond of Kishore\u2019s voice. However he knew clearly what songs Kishore was capable of singing and what he was not. So in his magnum opus \u2018Guide\u2019 , Kishore has a place in \u2018Gaata rahe mera dil\u2019 but who steals the show? Mohd. Rafi. Go and listen to \u2018Din dhal jaye\u2019 and tell me if anyone could have rendered it better. Composers at that time were quite aware of every singer\u2019s limitations . Salil chowdhary\u2019s favourite was Mukesh but when it came to singing a song with high notes \u2019Tute hue khwabon ne\u2019 in \u2018Madhumati\u2019, guess who was summoned? Mohd. Rafi, again. Also, Salil chowdhary initially dismissed kishore\u2019s singing as \u2018laboured\u2019 . Now being untrained what Kishore could sing is nothing short of extraordinary. Within his limitations he was terrific and he had that\u2019 khanak\u2019 in his voice that was joy to listen to. He later surprised many people when who had dismissed him . Salil chowdary was surprised after Kishore sang \u2018 Koi hota jisko apna\u2019. But still I do think Rafi being product of training and talent was just a more rounded singer. He had huge range and when it came to singing high notes or going from high note to low, he had no competition. Try singing \u2018\u2019Ehsan tera hoga mujhpar\u2019 or \u2018Is rang badalti duniya me\u2019 and you will see how hard those songs are to sing. So in my view there has been no male singer as complete as Rafi in hindi cinema. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion rafi sahab is undoubtedly the best singer, he was the icon in the field of playback singing. Some people say that kishore da have won more number of filmfare awards than rafi sahab so when it comes to winning Filmfare awards I do not consider as the only way to compare any two singers as the songs for that they had not won the awards were far superior in my view for eg rafi sahab didn't get award for the song o duniya k rakhwale, man tarpat hari darshan ko, hoke majboor mujhe, mei ye soch kar uske dar se utha tha jaanewalo jara ,kisi ki yaad mei that ghazal and many more. But when you are comparing any two singers leaving apart their hits they had given, We should consider different traits which are more important for a playback singer. Firstly playback singer is a person who can make it feel from behind the scene or u can say from his voice about the actor and should have the quality to emulate the situation or the scenario for which he/she is singing which was very well their in rafi sahab (as said by many experts which was not their in other singers as such) Now comes the second most important factor that is the versatality which was the second name of mohd rafi I don't have any mood or any moment for which rafi sahab has not rendered a song. We all the fans of rafi sahab has every moment to cherish with his song. He was far beyond excellence as he had sung a ghazal, qawwali, bhajan, romantic songs ,fast romantic songs ,classical, sad, sufi songs which was missing in any other singers in one or the other way. Now several different traits like diction, expression, voice modulation, lip synchronisation , sur his soulful voice which were his trademarks was also missing in other singers in one or the other as said earlier. But some people say Kishore da is more popular than rafi sahab they are not wrong but I can give the reason for the same as said by (manna dey) their was not much to sing in kishore da 's song but their were many complications in songs sung by him and rafi sahab. So you can figure out the people now a days go for the easy songs in reality shows or live auditions also they will rush to sing the hit songs not the good songs or the challenging won, I repeat it is not necessary that the good song will win the award it usually does not happen songs like \"khaike paan bana raswala \"gets hits instead of \u201cchukar mere man ko\u201d so you can understand what I am saying so that's the main reason why kishore da is more popular than rafi sahab because rafi's song are usually more complicated than of kishore da or mukesh kumar or any other except manna dey (if you are comparing the singers of golden era only) because he used to sing more classical songs which was his forte. I remember a show was held where many musical experts were present and their was a poll on the best song of all time and \u201c Man re tu kaahe na dheer dhare\u201dwas nominated as the number 1 song. Now talking about his charismatic figure he has created many romantic actors with his voice, such was the magic of rafi sahab who remember Biswajeet ji, Joy Mukherjee but they will be remembered to act for rafi's voice as I remember once Jeetendra ji said we are lucky as we were rented the voice of rafi sahab .Now I think I have covered maximum points in terms of my knowledge about singing of rafi sahab and why he was the greatest but I want to conclude what I had said about him is my observations from different YouTube Channels and T.V. Channels etc but I want to say that whatever I have explained about him as a singer is just 0.001% of what he exactly was, he was far beyond that and as a person he was far beyond the reach of human so you can assume what a gem of a person he was. Everyone has his/her opinion it may differ to you but I have unbiasedly given my views u can infer if you want any proof. ",

            "answer_text": "If you take it on an ability to deliver songs that were purely classical, it was Mohd.Rafi, be it \"Man tarpat Hari darshan ko\"  or \"Man re tu kahe dheer dhare\".  And Rafi saab had a great range too, from pure classical( Man re tu kahe dheer dhare) to soulful( Raahi manwa dukh ke chinta)  to romantic( Laakhon hain Nigahon mein) to plain boisterous( Chahe koi mujhe Junglee kahe), he could effortlessly  switch from one genre to another. Now if you consider versatility, Kishore Da had his limitations, he was not a trained singer, and he could not have gone for a pure classical based song or something like \"Kar chale hum fida\". But within his limitations, Kishore Da was versatile, while he was initially famed for his yoodle yoo songs, he could effortlessly switch into serious, romantic  or pensive mood.  Add to it Kishore Da, had the knack of  modulating his voice suitably for the actor. For eg when he sang for Amitabh Bachan, more or less you felt it was AB himself singing the songs. Let me just give one example, the Mach Gaya Shor song from Khuddar, for a long time, I was fooled into thinking it was AB himself who sang that song, and then I heard that it was Kishore Da, who modulated his voice to resemble Amitabh's. You can dismiss that as gimmicks, but it still takes talent to produce one.     I would not bring in the class vs mass distinction to Kishore Da and Rafi, both of them were equally popular with the masses. I mean people jive to a \"Oh Haseena Zulfo waale jaane\" as much as they would to a \"Khaike paan banaras waala\".  Where Rafi saab would score over Kishore Da is in the ability to pull off classical songs or ghazals. One more aspect Kishore Da was not just a singer, he was an actor, music director, movie director too, so his versatiity is in another range. To me both Kishore Da and Rafi were great singers in their own different way. ",

            "answer_text": "Although, I am not a trained musician nor I have as yet performed in any local live events as well, but I just have a knack of singing since it is one of my most favorite and revered things. Now that I have cleared my bio so that no confusion may arise on my analysis on both.  If I be loyal and honest, right from the very beginning of my listening to urdu/hindi songs (I am a fan of pop western music of 70s, 80s, and 90s) my vote as my \"Guru\" will first go to Kishore Da. Let give the reason why.  I actually started to listen to urdu/hindi songs because of Kishore Da, and from that time onwards, I took him as my spiritual musical \"Guru\". The heavy bass-like voice of Kishore da is what made me his fan (I have a similar voice tone). Also, I found myself singing Kishore Da's  most songs quite easily without any hassles. Finally, to me, he was a singer whom I should like to be if I ever have a reincarnation.  Now, concerning to Rafi Sahab, at the time I started to listen urdu/hindi songs, I was not so much acquainted with Rafi Sahab, and due to my lack of ignorance, I often said to many people that Rafi is nothing but just a normal singer who gets too much acclaim for being superior then others.  However, this was soon prove to be a very fatal and humiliating mistake of mine, exactly on the day when I keenly and closely observed Rafi Sahab's these songs below: Man re Tu kahe Na Dheer Dhare Main ye soch Ker Uske Dar se Utha Tha Akhri Geet Mohubbat Ka Suna doon To Chalo Rahi Manwa Dukh Ki Chinta Aj Kal Main Dhal Gaya Chahonga Main Tujhe Sanjh Saware Mera To Jo bhi Kadam Hai Khuda Kare Ke Qayamat Ho Mare Mehboob Mujhe Tare Mohubbat Ki qasam Man Tadpat Hari Darhsan Ko Aaj And numerous other songs spanning all genres of music. After listening to all those songs, and not imitating even one of his songs as accurately as I did with kishore Da, I then humbly and apologetically confessed a heartfelt apology to Rafi Sahab's soul because I in my ignorance completely disrespected and thrashed what is supposed to be the most greatest singer ever produced in the entire sub-continent, in fact, the world.  I found out that rafi sahab, in his unique voice and singing abilities, was much much ahead of almost entire lot of singer from the past and present. Therefore, I am not amazed at the fact that many singers/people in the sub-continent considers Rafi Sahab a \"Bhagwaan\" of singing. I too come to the same conclusion.  But I still remain loyal to my first teacher who was Kishore da and I still consider him my guru. Had I heard Rafi Sahab before Kishore Da, my choice would then certainly be none other then this maha guru of singing. But in the end, let there be no comparisons between legends, Kishore da in his own way was unique and I respect him a lot on the fact that he never learn music, still he manages to give us ever-green hits like: Musafir hoon yaroon O majhi re Mera dil ke chen 'Main shayar badnaam Mera naina sawan bhado Koi shama shesshe ki laya Kaise kahen hum pyaar ne humko Khizan ke phool pe ati kabhi bahar nahin Ruk Ja na nahin tu kabhi harke Mera jeevan kora kaghaz  and there were many other classics by the ultimate craftsman of bollywood. I edge him over Rafi sahab only because of one very strong and exceptional quality: You can never sing such hits so easily as Kishore Da did without getting any training for classical music and yet he proved that his talent was far bigger then any schooling. Had Kishore da been trained in classical music, I have no hesitation in believing that he would indeed be much more revered then what he is now. Thank you for boring with my commentary (its too long) but I always like to be in details so as to avoid any confusion. :)  ",

No place of \u201c I like Kishore da more or Rafi Saab is the best\u201d Singing ability: Rafi 10 Kishore 7 Rafi could sing every genre of songs. Kishore could not obviously sing Qawaali, Ghazal, Classical or high pitched songs as, however talented he was, he didnt have any classical trainingVoice Quality: Rafi 9.5 Kishore 10 This is a matter of personal choice, Rafi\u2019s voice was polished, smooth. Kishore was lively with excellent talent and range. However, Kishore became Kishore because of his voice quality, hence I will give him slight advantage. Most Kishore fans like him for his voice quality and the hits he delivered with modern music and instrumentation.Playback Style: Rafi 10 Kishore 8 This is where Rafi changed the game for playback singing. Kishore also did an excellent job and varied his voice for the actors, but not as much as Rafi did. Please watch this video for more details on YouTube : Javed Akhtar on Mohd Rafi4. Style of singing / (Expressions / adaa): Rafi 10 Kishore 9. Rafi could emphasize on words the way only he could. Kishore was excellent in expression too and Yodelling made him famous, but many of his songs were very flat and expressionless, even in his golden years. Rafi could Yodel too but didn\u2019t use it much as he didn\u2019t like it ( and frankly, its not a singer\u2019s choice but a music director\u2019s choice whether to use it or not ). Search YouTube for Rafi Yodeling and you will get the examples. 5. Popularity as Voice of famous stars: Rafi 10 Kishore 8.5 Rafi was the voice of many many famous superstars, most notably Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand ( 50:50), Dharmendra etc and he sang for ALL stars of Bollywood from 1950s to 1980s. That included singing for Kishore Kumar himself. Kishore Kumar was mainly the voice of Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bacchhan ( mainly in 1980\u2019s after Rafi\u2019s death). 6. Popularity as Favourite of Music Director: Rafi 10 Kishore 8 Similarly, Rafi sang for all music directors from 1950\u20131980, Kishore was chosen by only few, namely mainly Dev-Burmans before 1970. Naushad for example will hardly, if ever take Kishore. Rafi was favourite of Naushad, OP Nayyar, Shankar Jaikishen, Laxmi Pyare ( 50:50 ), SD Burman ( 50:50). Kishore was favourite of RD Burman, and that made him what he is. Bappi Lahiri and others came to the field mainly after Rafi passed away in the 1980s. 7. Longevity and number of recordings: Rafi 9 Kishore 8.5 Rafi was undisputed number 1 during 1950\u20131970. Kishore was Undisputed number 1 in 1970\u20131987 ( Rafi Mukesh Manna De all kept on winning awards even during 1970\u20131980, when Rafi died). Rafi Sang around 4500 songs, Kishore sang around 2500; however Kishore\u2019s career spanned more than Rafi\u2019s. 8. Fan Following: Rafi 10 Kishore 9.5 this is why we need to discuss these things, the fans. Kishore is more popular among the youths as he sang more modern numbers. However, in all polls of best playback singers, Rafi or Rafis songs are number one. Voice of the millenium CNN IBN was Rafi. BBC best song of the century was Rafi\u2019s Baharon phool barsao Etc. Also, Rafi is more popular abroad like in the UK, where there is a large Urdu speaking population. Hence I will keep Rafi slightly ahead of Kishore in popularity. One thing regarding this is from my experience. If one has properly listened to at least 500 Rafi and Kishore songs, that person will be a Rafi fan, if not a fan of both of them (like me ). Most Kishore fans haven\u2019t heard enough of Rafi before they pass judgement like \u2018Kishore is best\u2019! The songs of Kishore Kumar are unparalleled, so is the singing of Rafi\u2019s songs. 9. Awards: Rafi 9, Kishore 7. Kishore has not won any prestigious National Award as a singer. Filmfare awards need more analysis. Kishore has won 2 more filmfare awards than Rafi. Most of Kishore\u2019s Filmfare Awards (5) was in the 1980\u2019s when Rafi Mukesh all had passed away; with everyone around, he did not win much ( only 3) , even in 1970s when he was superhit and his songs were chartbusters Filmfare Award started in 1967 as separate male and female categories. In 1961\u20131967 it was one for both categories. Rafi would have won quite a few from 1947\u20131967 it is fair to assume, had the award started then. Same with National award. Still he got one in 1977 in his fading years. Also he got Padmashree. 10. Respect of fellow singers: Rafi 10, Kishore 7 Manna Dey: Has unequivocally said Rafi is the best Kavitha Krishnamoorthy, SP, Yesudas etc have all said Rafi is the best and is like God. I am yet to find a learned person ( musically ) saying Kishore is better than Rafi. Some have said they like Kishore more ( those are different matter and personal choice ) but nobody has said Kishore is a better singer than Rafi. There have been many songs sung by many many kishore copycats where they have sung the song as well ( if not better sometimes) than Kishore, including Yodeling. There has only been a few occassional Sonu Nigham songs which are actually almost as good as Rafi\u2019s original. Overall score : Rafi is the clear winner. There is no comparison as singer. He is more accomplished, popular ( amongst the musically knowledgable) and respected ( Rafi Saab vs Kishore Da ). Kishore is a better performer than Rafi, has a more popular voice among the masses, has a more easier to copy singing style and is more popular among the new generation due to more recent hits ( thanks Pancham Da ). Kishore benefitted immensely as his voice suited the new style of instrument based western influenced music created in Mid 70 onwards. Overall however, as far as singing goes, there is undoubtedly only one Numero Uno, Rafi Saab! ",

            "answer_text": "Kishore Kumar is definitely an untrained singer,but he is the biggest musical lodestar India has ever produced. He also has a global appeal, and is recognized internationally. This is so, as most of his songs were for legends like Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor and Vinod Khanna. While considering the exception of Rishi Kapoor, these stars had a string of blockbusters, thus establishing Kishore Kumar as the superlative icon here. Mohammed Rafi, is an undoubtedly stellar musician, but his prowess cannot match the dominance of Kishore Kumar. With the dawn of early 1970\u2019s , Rafi\u2019s popularity gradually reduced, especially after Kishore da recorded for Rajesh Khanna\u2019s grand debut Aradhana. Once Rajesh Khanna attained superstardom, his voice became the inertia of Kishore Kumar\u2019s success. Later on with the emergence of the \u201cAngry Young Man\u201d, Kishore Kumar manifested the zenith of success. Rishi Kapoor\u2019s romantic tracks had Kishore Kumar\u2019s confluence, thus widely moulding him as a chocolate boy. One of this includes, the songs of Karz. While songs like Ek haseena Thi and Om Shanti Om, paved its way for the national awards, Mohammed Rafi\u2019s Dard-E-Dil Jigar, barely got the audience ringing! Kishore Kumar has had bigger hits and larger successes like Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si, Roop Tera Mastana, Mere Sapnon ki Rani, Dilbar Mere, Chalte Chalte, Saara Zamana, Jab Kisi se Pyaar Ho jai, Om Shanti Om, Ek Haseena Thi, Sagar Jaise Aankhon wali, to name a few. Kishore Kumar also was gifted the ability to easily transgress from one voice to another. The deep baritone he implied for Bachchan ji, varied intrusively from that of Rajesh khanna\u2019s tracks or even for a star like Rishi Kapoor. Mohammed Rafi\u2019s struggle story is not as heavy as that of Kishore Kumar. Kishore da came from amid poverty and a treacherous family backgroun. After being rejected from the All India Radio, claiming that he \u201c\"lacked the talent to sing and was better if he worked as some bechara sewage cleaner\u201d Yet, his growth and rise to power dumbfounded his critics and since then, manipulated a string of successes. Rafi certainly had many failures, with the growing transcedence of Kishore da in the 1970\u2019s. Kishore Kumar never confronted any failures , post Aradhana. He was multi faceted. He was and still is the best singer, a versatile actor, a skilled producer and a witty director. While Mohammed Rafi was only a playback singer, and couldn't win the Hearts of many, after Kishore\u2019s power lobbing successes. Thus by virtue, I find Kishore Kumar the better singer and the playback singer, which ruled and still rules the hearts of every individual. ",

            "answer_text": "Both of them are unbeatable and still rock the world of their fans. Rafi seemed better in classical with lightning taans and murkis. His voice more suited the shy, romantic, cultured, serious, nice types of heroes. Shammi Kapoor seemed to be an exception for whom Rafi developed a special style. His voice was soft and subdued mostly and he could touch very high notes. Kishore was not so classically trained but still could manage taans and murkis. He differenciated by introducing funny styles, loud noises, yodeling and literally creating new stuff with his voice. His voice quality was bold and unorthodox. Both of them brimed with creativity and maintained perfect sur and emoted fun, sadness, romance in a way no one did before. Both of them would research the hero's voice and tried to make it sound like the hero is singing. But Rafi I think got stuck up with his style after a point. The newer heroes started to portray competiveness, anger, smartness, power, might, bullying, rebel, drunk, etc in their character for which only Kishore could adapt. So Rafi may have gotten behind in the rat race as the world changed to a tough one and he was inherently a nice guy. But as fans of both, both have given us enough treasure to cherish their accomplishments. While listening to their songs one can fulfill their souls while admiring the sheer creativity that flowed through their talents. ",

Another great feature of Rafi's character (or modesty) was that he regarded Manna Dey as a better classical singer than himself. I have heard that when some heavily classical songs were offered to him, he suggested that they should be given to Manna Dey, and the suggestion was not wrong. Rafi also gave his voice for some classical songs lipped by Kishore on the screen. The music directors knew that Kishore simply could not sing them. ",

People are able to connect more Laxman/Dravid have taken lots of pain to understand and adopt to Test cricket which is considered more classy than t20/one day, but the price they pay is it is not popular with masses and hence less money. But someone who knows Test Cricket will say they are more complete players than Dhoni coming back Rafi saab is king of classical songs which require heavy understanding of music and also general public normally dont relate to it, Kishore da is king of entertainment for the masses and is quite popular So, you cannot compare ",

Rafi Saab has sweet and melodious voice. for reference type Sonu Nigam on Rafi  in YouTube he explained it how Rafi Saab was better than everyone in Bollywood History.

Compare ye sham mastani, Chhu kar mere man ko, Kora kagaz tha ye man mera Zindagi ek sauhana, Khizan ke ful pe with Khoya Khoya chand, Husnwale tera jawab nahin, Teri aankho ke siwa, Pukarta chala hun mai and Aaz ki raat mere dil ki salami lele...Which songs are sweater ? Rafi Saab's voice is the most melodious male voice that we have heard so far. ",

Kishore da is famous in masses for the fact that most of his songs were simple yet soothing, which any normal guy can try to sing.. Any beginner who likes singing, listens to Kishore da and understands the basics.. Rafi is a many steps ahead.. You gotta be perfect to attempt his songs.. Having said that, I love the depth in Kishore da's voice.. \"Mere naina sawan bhado\" still gives me the goose bumps.. He was a gem in his own territory and could connect to common man.. ",

But i must say MOHD RAFI was  a little ahead of these 2 singers as well because to me RAFI had the best skill as a singer as well as the best voice. His ease towards singing any song is unmatched. So RAFI SAAB all the way in history of singing. ",

            "answer_text": "According to me Kishore Kumar is far better, because his songs take us to another world when it comes to sentimental songs. After 1969, every film star dreamt of giving lipping for the songs of Kishore Kumar. Presence of Kishore Kumar\u2019s songs in those days in a film was a way of taking the film a few steps towards the path of success. Besides, whenever he sang together with any other singer, male or female, it was always Kishore Kumar\u2019s portion that got more attention of the listeners and still contues to do the same. Moreover, the heroic aspect in Kishore Kumar\u2019s voice suits heroes in the films. The timelessness in the songs of Kishore Kumar is unmistakable even today and that's why we have heard some wonderful singers, like Kumar Sanu, Abhijit, Shaan and even Arijit Singh, the impact of Kishore Kumar\u2019s style influenced them all. Oscar award winner Satyajit Ray, once said that Kishore Kumar is the most natural singer. Kishore Kumar never learned music and his style is always effortless and yet he can bind us all with his magical voice and melody. Manna Dey once said that every singer, no matters how much classically trained he or she may be, on odd occasions, he or she may not hit all notes absolutely correctly. However, Kishore Kumar is always always spot on. Even when he is dancing on the stage, no compromise with sur. He is the most gifted and natural singer the world has ever produced. ",

Bharat Bhushan, Pradeep Kumar, Joy Mukherjee, Biswajeet, etc\u2026.whereas Kishoreda gained a lot because of the popularity of Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan. Though Kishoreda is great in his own way, Rafisaab is simply street ahead of the rest. If someone comes close to him, then it is Lata Mangeshkar. Yes, Kishoreda gave more fun numbers than Rafisaab, and people jive to it, but that doesn\u2019t make him a better singer. People get confused between their favorite singer and who is the best. Though I am a huge fan of Rahul Dravid, I have to accept that Sachin was simply better than him. Similarly many fans of Kishoreda accept that as a singer Rafisaab has no competition ",

That does not, however, mean that Rafi was the \"better\" singer. Kishore Kumar had his unique talents. For example, he was one of the few (only?) singers in Bollywood who could yodel. :) It's a very subjective and personal choice. Any trained singer would choose Rafi whereas as Siddharth says, Kishore would be the more popular choice. ",
