            "answer_text": "If you have a smartphone or tablet it can be connected via its stereo headphone connector to that aux port and its output will be played through the car stereo. So what you need to do is get the music files transferred to your playing device first, then get it playing while hooked up to your car. That is just a matter of using your usb port to transfer the files from the flash drive to your play device. ",

            "answer_text": "So I understand that you have an AUX socket in the car. On the other hand you have music files stored on a USB drive. What you need is a MP3 Player which accepts a stick as a music source and has an earphone socket on the other. Let it play the music on your thumb drive and connect the earphone socket and your car\u2019s AUX socket with a 3.5 mm audio cable. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess it depends on your radio. In my Toyota I can just plug in a USB thumb drive, or an MP3 player, or indeed my Android phone, and the Sony radio will search it for MP3s and play them. So I guess my answer to your question is yes, there are good devices, they're called aftermarket radios. ",
