            "answer_text": "The most difficult instruments to play (in order of intimidation): 1. Pedal Steel Guitar - Seven pedals and four knee levers dynamically  change the relative intonation of ten strings that are also dynamically  parallel intonated by a steel bar that moves over them with one hand  while the other finger picks the strings with all five fingers!  Dont  think for a second that the pedal steel guitar is for dumb country hicks.  You have  to have a mind like the rain man to keep track of what note is where.  Pedal steel  guitar is staggeringly intimidating. 2. Concert Pipe Organ - Two or three keyboards for the hands, one keyboard for the feet, volume and swell pedals, and an array of hundreds of stops to alter tone. All controlled at the same time... while reading a three or four staff Olivier Messiaen score!  Good luck. 3. Chromatic Button Accordion (in free bass mode) - The Russian Bayan is one of the most respectable and spectacular instruments ever designed.  Top instruments from Pigini go for US $50k+.  But dont even think of learning it without a teacher.  There are hundreds of buttons for each hand arranged in a repeating yet unintuitive order.  Each button on the bass hand can switch between playing chords and single notes.  These are played simultaneously along with the bellows (which require a surprising amount of strength and dexterity to play sensitively) and chin switches which alter the tone.  You may look like a monkey playing it but the music is stunning when played well. 4. Baroque Cello - Bowed instruments are all pretty difficult to coordinate and intonate.  But the cello is the most challenging of all because it has the longest strings that are tuned in 5ths.  As a result, it requires the most amount of hand motion to capture a note.  While the bass' strings are thicker and harder to manipulate, its  intonation in 4ths makes the notes typically required fall under the  fingers more often without having to make huge arm shifts.  Also, the  thinner, higher tension cello 'A' string really cuts into the flesh in  higher \"thumb position\".  Until proper technique and callus are formed  it can sometimes draw blood.  Baroque music is typically played in unequal temperaments (Well, Meantone, etc) that require different intonations for the same note played in different key signatures.  This must be dynamically adjusted in real time by ear by the player, often without vibrato to help fudge it.  And because the cello strings are so long, this adjustment requires the most amount of finger motion to accomplish.  And on top of this, the baroque cello was typically played without an end pin, meaning that the player had to support the instrument's weight by squeezing inward with his thighs.   5. Six Mallet Marimba - Marimba is a relatively easy instrument to play  with one mallet in each hand,  But all that changes when you use three  mallets in each hand to play chords and high speed lines!  Good players  display a daunting degree of digital dexterity.  6. Beatbox - Just watch some of those beatbox videos on YouTube and  you'll know why this is on the list.  Some crazy beatboxers can sound  like a drum kit, an 808 synth module and a singer at the same time!   7. Didjeridu - From what I hear playing didj well requires the lungs of a triathlete and the lips of an oboist.  This instrument is traditionally played using advanced circular breathing technique that would make a free pearl diver bust a lung. 8. Tympani - There is a reason why the tympanist is the highest paid  member of the orchestra.  There is no room for the slightest amount of  error.  The strikes must be perfectly timed and the heads perfectly  intonated.  Any mistake can make the whole orchestra sound amateurish.   Any modern orchestra is only as good as its tympanist.  No pressure. ",

            "answer_text": "My vote goes to violin:  I\u2019ve had this little saying whenever I\u2019ve been asked a question of this sort, pertaining to the difficulty of the violin/guitar. I usually start with an analysis of the accessibility of the violin versus the guitar. For the guitar, you pick it up, tune it, and play it.For the violin, you open the case, you remove the violin, you tune it, attach the shoulder rest, tighten the bow, resin the bow, and retune it, since it\u2019s inevitably come de-tuned in the time you\u2019ve taken during this endeavor. Then, if you hold it just right, with the bow held in just the right sort of grip, with your wrists pointed the right way, and all the planets are aligned on Friday the 13th on your birthday, it MIGHT NOT make the sound of a dying cat stuck inside a bagpipe.This is exaggeration, of course. But like all things of hyperbole, there\u2019s an element of truth to it. For example, examine the fine tuner at the base of the violin in the picture above. Compare them to the ones in the violin below.  You\u2019ll notice that, unlike the violin pictured above, the violin below has fine tuning machines for each of its strings. This allows you to more easily tune the individual strings to perfection without having to use the brutal and unyielding tuning pegs up by the scroll. So then, Trevor, why don\u2019t all violin\u2019s have fine tuners? Because there\u2019s a hierarchy here. The people who have fine tuners on all of their strings are either beginners or PUSSIES. And the people who have NO fine tuners are the mightiest who\u2019ve transcended to a higher realm, who operate on a higher level altogether, with absolute trust in the instrument they wield. I\u2019ve never really understood it, but that\u2019s pretty much how the dogma goes in the world of classical instruments. So much about learning to play the violin seems to come from this pretentiousness; as though you\u2019re somehow destined to become a vastly superior musician, one who can read sheet music flawlessly, and who no doubt plays in a symphony. Even finding everyday music written for the violin is much harder than finding tabs to play for guitar, or even piano. You\u2019re ONLY expected to learn to play classical. I\u2019ve never really understood these views, expressed by my teachers and peers. I\u2019ve only ever been motivated by the sound of the instrument and my desire to play songs that I genuinely enjoy. Overall, in the hubris that surrounds it, the violin becomes much less accessible to beginners than other instruments, all while posing a challenge to play that remains steep for beginners and experts.
