            "answer_text": "Everywhere from a little to a LOT. The people making a lot: first chairs in major orchestras make a bunch.Before George Strait retired, his band was on salary at around $180K per person (for fewer than hundred dates a year; lots of time for second bands). He was also reported to be a prince to work for. His turnover rate approached zero. Some stars pay their band LOTS. Some pay starvation wages.The cats on the Nashville \u201cA team\u201d make around $400 per three hour session (and I bet scale has gone up, I think that's an old number), and they can do at least ten a week if they get the calls. They also get residuals for sales and airplay of any hits they've played onThe guys who don't make much: most of us with day jobs and side bands. There are oodles of star-quality players who love to play, but don't want to play professionally because that's a life of hard touring or constantly hustling up the next gig and playing good paying gigs that are torture to play. So they drive a truck, they make maps, they're undertakers, they're nurses. The bands are less of a job than their \u201cbowling night\u201d, where they go to a bar, hang out with their friends and make noise, AND SOMEBODY PAYS US. It doesn't take a big incentive to get some pretty good musicians out of the house, if the rest of the band is good. It's an absolute BLAST to make good music, so not a lot of money gets us to schlep our gear across town. If you're young, and you want to be a musician but you don't want to tour and you don't have the connections to get session work, it's unfortunate, but you're competing with a crapton of really good players with decades of experience who don't need the money. I'd apologize, but all the other steel players in town are older than me, and in the same boat. I'm not taking YOUR gigs. And I'll be happy to share licks with you if you want to get better. ",

            "answer_text": "Pay depends on the situation. You could play at a bar for a box of cold, half eaten chicken wings (a personal experience of mine- \"them's the blues\" they say), or you could play an arena of 30,000 people and be treated like a rockstar (another, much much better experience). My pay, for example, is pretty standard for a jobbing musician in Chicago. I don't leave the house for less than $100. My studio pricing is much different. I charge per song and it depends on what I'm contributing to the album. I charge more for horn parts and arranging than I do for a solo. It's usually time based (per hour) for most guys and it depends on their experience and efficiency- you get paid better to have your stuff together and you'll get more gigs. That goes for performance too. Most clubs/bars don't pay much unless you have a nice following and split the door charge. There's so many variables to getting paid. I feel like I rambled a little, but you get the idea. One thing I'll pass on: set your price to your worth and do not chase those little money hustles. Yes, the occasional friend favors will come along, but friends rarely pay your bills. Don't be afraid to say no to the people making you put in too much work for too little pay. They will respect you eventually, and you will get paid what you ask for\u2026 ahem, what you deserve. ",
