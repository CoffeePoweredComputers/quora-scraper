            "answer_text": "Urdu Poetry, Urdu Shayari of Famous Poets - Rekhta (rekhta.org) is the best platform that is having a great repository of poetry written in Hindi and Urdu.The another user friendly feature of this website is that you can easily look up the defination of a word by just tapping on it,and the User interface of their android application is quite a bit amazing, above all ,it is accessible to everyone ,no premium account needed. I personally think, Rekhta is to hindi poetry what Google is to Internet. They also organise events that promote poetry,for the sheer rationale is that they want to popularise Hindi and Urdu poetry, which unfortunately many of us consider old school .You can also like their instagram and facebook page where they keep posting the best of their collections.
