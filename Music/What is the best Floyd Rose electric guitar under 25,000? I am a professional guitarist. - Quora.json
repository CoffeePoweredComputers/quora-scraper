            "answer_text": "Depends on what kind of music you want it for? I play on mostly Worship Teams and I bought a 1994 Gibson Nighthawk CST3 that has a Factory Floyd Rose on it. I bought it from Motor City Guitars in Pontiac, MI in 1996 for $1600. Other than the tricky string changes, this guitar has been very reliable. This Nighthawk is a very versatile guitar. It has the slanted humbucker in the bridge position, a single coil in the middle and a mini-hum at the neck. It also has a 5 way p/u switch with coil tapping which allows you 10 different coil combos. The Nighthawk is similar to a HSH Strat and is very bluesy. But it can sound close to a Les Paul, a Tele and a Strat. The mini humbucker by itself has some nice harmonic overtones too. Don't confuse the 1990's Nighthawk with the current model. The early ones are the best by far. Better woods, pickups, and features. You can find vintage 90's models for $800\u20131600 on Ebay. The Custom / CST's are the top model but an ST is nice as well. While a Floyd Rose equipped version is somewhat rare, they do come up for sale. If at all possible get the 3 pu version to get the coil tapping setup. The other killer Floyd Rose guitar is the Alex Lifeson Les Paul Custom Shop guitar. They were about $5K new and had some custom p/u wiring as well. I'm sure PRS has something similar. Here's my Nighthawk.  Best of Luck in your decision & hunt. Allen ",
