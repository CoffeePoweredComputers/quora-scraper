            "answer_text": "Yes. I love METALLICA. Like literally every single song off everything before St. Anger. These are the qualities of ENTER THE SANDMAN that I love. This song has a great mix of distorted guitar with the clean riff. This intentional switch represents a lot more than an accident to me. I feel as though he clean riff is the sleepy feeling of drifting off, and then the nightmare starts with tghe distorted guitar parts. I like the story aspect of this song. Metallica songs tend to tell very vivid and oftentimes otherworldly stories. I know Metallica was heavily influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft and also Ernedt Hemingway, who are two of the greatest writers of all time. I believe this ability to write amazing stories rubbed off on the band members.. This song, like almost all the best Metallica songs, is orchestral in it's composition. This song is one of my favorite Metallica compositions. The song builds up and plateaus and drops again and all of the instruments rise and fall with each other. I am a huuuge Lars Ulrich fan, and I feel that the drumming in this song is a pretty good indication as his abilities as a drummer. I love his quick yet powerful build ups, and when he goes HAM, it is always a treat. Also, if you have never seen the music video for this particular Metallica song, definitely check it out. It will give you an even better understanding of of the song. I am not sure if many people are aware how many Metallica songs are directly influenced by addiction to hard drugs, especially cocaine, but songs like MASTER OF PUPPETS and this one are definitely influenced in AT LEAST A SMALL WAY by the pains of drug addiction and the resulting withdrawal sickness that makes it impoedinle to sleep or even rest or feel any sense of comfort at all. Withdrawal from drugs is a freaking nightmare. ENTER THE SANDMAN is an awesome song that I have been listening to since I was a little kid. I have a brother who is eight years older than me who introduced me to toooooons of awesome music, and this song was on one particular mixtape that I ended up inheriting. Yes, that's right kiddies, this was back in the early nineties, when we had the joy of making mixtapes on these things called CASSETTE TAPES from our favorite songs on the radio!!!!! Oh, the nostalgia\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "I love the opening riff. It feels layered, builds slowly, one on top of the other until it turns to the full-blown riff. Then there\u2019s that Hetfield voice, the drums. Basically I love all of metallica\u2019s songs, but I love to listen to this one when I\u2019m pumping weights or even running - I just happen to run faster when this song is playing. ",
