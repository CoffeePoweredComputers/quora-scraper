            "answer_text": "The two answers so far are pretty good, but one had something a little bit weird that I want to clarify because if you do what he says, you\u2019ll end up doing it wrong. I\u2019m not doubting that he knows what he\u2019s talking about, but I think he explained it in a way that will lead you astray. The other guy\u2019s song suggestions were great, too, but I still have something to add to what both said. Just to be clear that we\u2019re starting from the same place, let\u2019s be clear that \u201cAm pentatonic scale\u201d is the five tones, A, C, D, E and G. There are other pentatonic scales, but we\u2019ll stick to just this one here. The idea of \u201cany song in A minor\u201d works fine and is a good way to filter candidates to practice your scale running. This is because most popular songs and folk songs stick to pentatonic scale tones in their melodies and instrumental solos. Nearly all indigenous folk music forms throughout the world principally rely on pentatonic scales. In older cultures, for the most part, \u201cmusic\u201d is a pentatonic scale. Anything else seems odd and somehow wrong in the context of that genre. If you find that your pentatonic minor scale noodling with a song in Am seems anemic, it\u2019s probably because the song uses a full-blown, heptatonic (seven-tone) Aeolian mode (minor) scale. Your minor pentatonic scale lacks two of the seven tones, B and F. You can continue playing along, but will have to work in those other two tones to make it sound right. If you want to stick to just pentatonic scales, abandon the song and pick another. The idea of \u201cany song in C major\u201d also works as a filter. Just as with the Am songs, you\u2019ll notice how well using just five tones does to allow you to play a convincing solo. It will sound good because it will sound a lot like the solos most people play. One of the weirdest discoveries I made in learning to take a solo was that using all seven tones in the scale of whatever key the piece was set usually ended up sounding less authentic and making me feel as if I were just playing random notes. Sticking more closely to the appropriate pentatonic scale eventually became my default strategy for solos, especially when I wasn\u2019t sure what I was doing. Of course, once you do get comfortable with making runs along a melodic line, you learn when you can use those other two tones in the scale, and when you can play notes with tones that are not in the scale at all. Until you figure out what\u2019s going on, though, stick to a pentatonic scale. You won\u2019t go too far wrong. The thing the guy said about blues is basically true, but misleading. When he said that your pentatonic scale would be \u201cmissing the blue notes,\u201d he would be right if you were playing along with blues in C. This means the rhythm guitars would be cranking out C7, F7 and G7. So, if you calculated that your Am pentatonic scale would fit with go with its relative major key, C, you would be correct. The trouble with doing that would be that you would sound like some cornball country guy \u201cpickin\u2019 and a-grinnin\u2019\u201d with the bluesmen and generally messing up the song. You would likely be rudely told to stop playing because, \u201cWe ain\u2019t doin\u2019 none o\u2019 that cowboy shit here today, sport.\u201d In this case, what should you do? Well,, for starters, you should actually play those missing blue notes, you know, to give your solo some of that real \u201cblues\u201d feeling. (What a concept!) So, what are they? The seventh tones in the C7 and F7 chords (B\u266d for the C7 and E\u266d for the F7) are not tones present in your normal C major or A minor scales. These are a flatted seventh and a flatted third with respect to the C major scale. If you played them in addition to the seven tones of either the C major or A minor scale, you would be playing nine tones. That\u2019s too many. If you played your A minor pentatonic scale plus the two \u201cblue note\u201d tones, that\u2019s seven. It\u2019s still too many and some of them are wrong. What you really need here is to play five tones in a pentatonic scale that includes those blue notes in the five-tone scale. OK. So, what are the other three? Let\u2019s build our minor pentatonic scale, with the blue notes, for blues, in C. C, the tonic (because you always have that)E\u266d, the minor 3rd (from the F7 chord)F, the perfect 4th (because most scales have this)G, the perfect 5th (because most scales have this, too)B\u266d, the minor 7th (from the C7 chord)Now, since you\u2019ve probably been playing your A minor pentatonic scale in a box from the fifth through eighth frets of your guitar, and the tonic is C now, we have to move the box up three frets and play the same box pattern on the eighth through eleventh frets. OK; go! Rip off a solo playing those five, and only those five, tones while everyone else cranks out the the blues progression with the C7, F7 and G7 chords. Did you notice something? Did you hear how good that sounded? You may have noticed something oddly similar here as well. The tone at the eighth fret of your E strings is C, which is the tonic of the key you are supposedly playing in. C is also the tonic of your minor pentatonic scale. Hmm\u2026 You have just discovered the \u201cdirty little secret\u201d of blues solos: The solo scale for blues is based on a minor pentatonic scale with the same tonic as the major scale of the purported \u201ckey\u201d that the rest of the band is using for their chord progression. Did you get that? You play a minor pentatonic scale in parallel with the major key scale! Cool. Since we were able to move the box around to play blues in C, ask yourself what key the band should use so you can do a fancy solo with your well-practiced A minor pentatonic scale. Obviously, it should be A, because that\u2019s the same tonic as in your solo scale. The harp (i.e., harmonica) player reaches for his \u201ccross harp\u201d, D, the subdominant of A, to pick up one of the blue notes, G, the flatted seventh of A major, which would normally be a G\u266f. One other blue note, D, the seventh tone in the E7 chord is already in the scale, so he has two out of three blue notes. That\u2019s usually enough for the harp player. Rock on. ",

            "answer_text": "What are some songs I can use the A minor pentatonic scale in? Literally any song in the key of A minor. And since any song in any minor key can be transposed into A minor, you can make a minor pentatonic work for any song in any minor key you want to use as long as you transpose it. Minor pentatonics can also be used as a substitute for a blues scale (minus the actual blue notes), so you can use it in any blues song, though it will lack some of the characteristic blues sound. So any blues song in A, or any blues song you transpose into A, will also work. All traditional Japanese and Chinese music is based on pentatonic scales, so you can also transpose any of those pieces of music (not just songs, but also instrumental pieces) into the key of A and they will already use the pentatonic scale.
