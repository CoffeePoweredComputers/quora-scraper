            "answer_text": "NOT REALLY.  These are the records Dynamite has set upto now globally. With 7.778 million first-day streams on the global Spotify chart, \"Dynamite\" surpassed Taylor Swifts Cardigan (7.742 million streams) for the biggest global debut of 2020.Dynamite\" also debuted atop the Billboard Digital Songs chart, selling 265,000 downloads \u2014the biggest pure sales week since Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do launched with 353,000 downloads in 2017.Most viewed music video within 24 hours.Now the thing about BTS songs are they tend to make a huge debut, but seem to fall off the charts quite easily. A songs success is mainly measured by how it fares in the long run, not its debut. A song can start at number 88, but if people like what they listen, it will climb and climb and climb. That's one of the main things that makes a song a sensation. Despacito was this song and the greatest hits always are the same. A songs anticipation will give it the big debut, but its greatness can only be measured in the long run. And that's why the biggest hits of 2020 are BLINDING LIGHTS  It wasnt even released this year, but is still on the charts to this day. It debuted at just number 14 and then fell 41 places to 52, but it kept going and going. On March, it finally hit number one. It has now spent a record breaking over 24 weeks on R&B's charts, and is still in the top 10 to this day, it was at number one for 4 weeks, and in the top ten for 28 weeks and still going with a whopping 39 weeks on the chart. This song doesnt have people who mass stream it nor does it get youtube views, it's just its sheer quality that gets it to where it is. It has over a billion streams on Spotify already, and in the way its headed, it shows no sign of stopping. And in fact there are many more great hits of 2020. THE BOX  Was atop at number one for 11, is still on the charts for 38 weeks now, even though it debut'd at number 47 only. If we dig deeper, we will realise that none of BTS's songs have ever even managed to achieve these stats. They will get a big debut because of their fans and anticipation, but quickly fall out of the charts. Their most streamed song is \u201cBoy With Luv\" but even that has around 500 million streams , which is great but far from any of the biggest hits of 2020. ON - A mere 2 weeks and then left the chart. Black Swan - 1 week Fake Love - 6 weeks Their biggest hit is actually Boy With Luv and Mic Drop which spent 8 weeks and 10 weeks on the chart. But those stats and their streams are far away to be considered biggest hits of that particular year. Now one of the many reasons I dislike streaming culture is that fans will stream no matter what, whether they like it or not. BTS were said to have broken the record of most streams in a single day when Dynamite got 12million streams, but it turns out it didnt. In fact, almost 5 million streams were FAKE.  It turns out the song was being streamed by so many fake accounts and even Army admit it.  This isnt the first time something like this has happened. That's why Spotify started a crackdown on illegal streams coz there have been countless times when BTS's songs were like that.  Please remember that if you keep going this, there will come a time BTS and Kpop songs will lose their legitimacy and all the music platforms like Spotify and many more will not hesitate to take serious action. Another problem is this.  If you dont know what this says, basically the same group of people are buying the same song again and again and again. Suppose a song \u201cA\" was bought by 100 people. But another song \u201cB\" was bought by 20 people but each person bought the same song 10 times so song B now creates the illusion that 200 people bought it. Now its obvious song A is more popular, but song B has more sales and thus the record will go to song B. This only creates an illusion of the songs popularity, and this model that Kpop runs on is going to destroy the entirety of legitimacy of music. I just hope fans realise they are taking things too far. Right now , more and more articles are being published about BTS's fake streams that disrupt the authenticity of the charts.

            "answer_text": "It's a hit song. But it's not the only song that released in 2020 there are so many hit songs are there like Blinding light, Savage love, Roses and etc. That song is gud. It achieved bbh100 bcz of Army they really work so hard for it. They even donate money to buy the song and skips their daily routine to get that Hit package. But music is all about longevity and enjoying not abt recording break and all the stuff. I definitely not claims Army are gud bt some of them are real very nice and matured bt not all every fandom has some toxic stan. So In conclusion this song was a hit bcz of Army. And I didn't like dynamite cause lyrics are cringy, love their car advertisements music. Its gud compared to dyno. Sry if I hurts your feelings. ",
