            "answer_text": "Well you have some options. One choice is to make a really long chord progression. The more different chords you add, the less likely it is that the progression is already in a song. The drawback of this is that long chord progressions can be frustrating to listeners because we all want closure; we want the progression to get back to the root chord. Another is to use chord intervals that are more dissonant. That is to say you can break the expectations of what a \u201cgood\u201d progression sounds like. Sometimes this works wonders and you get an unexpected masterpiece, but it often takes more playing around with to get it to sound good. I would recommend playing around with this: play a C major chord, then an F#, it will sound weird on its own, but then you can look for another chord that can follow and mellow it out a bit. Definitely more complicated than just following a standard pattern but it can also lead to really interesting and emotive songs. A third option: play around with the circle of fifths. Starting on C, go up 5 notes to G, then five more up to D, then A, E, B, F#, C#, G#, D#, Bb, F, C, G\u2026. The cycle keeps bringing you up and you can go through basically until you want to stop. For example \u201cHey Joe\u201d goes through the first 5 of those chords, hangs on the fifth chord (E in this case if you start from C) then goes back through the progression. A variation on this is Autumn leaves, which is based on the circle of fifths, but with some alternate chords near the end of the pattern to resolve back to the start. I would say the circle of fifths is the second most \u201cstandard\u201d type of progression after the 1\u20134\u20135 and related ones, and can foster a lot more variations. A last recommendation is to just use the standard 1\u20134\u20135 or similar and play around with inversions, instrumentation, differing rhythms etc. There\u2019s a reason why so many songs follow these patterns; they easily sound good!

            "answer_text": "Well, that\u2019s what harmony is about: to understand how chords are build, how do they relate each other, how can they be put in succession to make chord progressions, how tonal centers are related with their regions and what is the syntax behind all this fundamentals. By understanding this relations, many other chords can be built, so in fact there are many more chords than what you say in the details of your question. Let\u2019s make a little inventory in the tonal system\u2026 Let\u2019s think about C major, let\u2019s just put some chords that are closely related: We have 7 diatonic chords. 5 artificial dominants. 5 artificial diminished chords. 3 augmented sixth chords. 1 napolitan sixth chord coming from the relation with the minor subdominant. That is just to begin, because we also have the chords from close regions: the minor parallel is very close, the dominant region, the subdominant region, etc. So we have many, many chords. And besides, we have different tensions that can be applied to the same chord. We have sevenths, ninths, sixths, elevenths, thirteens. We have even a diminished 15th for the diminished chords! But, the study of harmony goes much further than that. We don\u2019t study harmony to make inventories of chords. The truth is that many great compositions use simple and even common progressions in a very effective way, with some unexpected elements. The real purpose of harmony is to understand the syntax behind the chord relations. When a great composer uses an unexpected chord, it is unexpected because there was something before. The beauty of that chord is related to the structure of this particular progression in this particular piece. You don\u2019t learn how to compose just by making weird progressions. Actually, most students of harmony can write a progression that sounds cool. But that is not music yet, it\u2019s just a step to understand deeper harmonic phenomena. The point is to understand the syntax and how harmony, structure, texture, melody and harmonic rhythm are related. I hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Chord progressions are one part of a song, yes, but not \u201cbasically\u201d that. However, coming up with a chord progression is, in my opinion, not possible to do by following rules. Good music is, by definition, not theorizable. There is no rule or process that you can apply that will lead you to a great song. It just doesn\u2019t exist, so don\u2019t look for it. What you can use to come up with those is your style, your taste, your knowledge, and your experience; in that order. If something sound right to you, then it\u2019s right. ",

When composers self-consciously pursue novelty simply to be \u201cnovel\u201d, it quickly loses its impact in repeated listening. However, quite \u201cconventional\u201d harmony can sound very original if presented unconventionally, as in:Adiemus (Live) - Karl Jenkins : Brevis Osijek where the choir is singing gibberish and in a \u201cclosed\u201d throat delivery. Play it on the piano and there\u2019s nothing particularly striking in it. ",
