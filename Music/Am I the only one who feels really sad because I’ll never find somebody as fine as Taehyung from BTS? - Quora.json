I don't know if this is normal... :') haha. Basically, this answer is going to be a hot mess because I'm going to try and explain what Taehyung\u2019s doing to my goddamn feels... *clutches heart He was the biggest heart throb I had ever come across...  It's just so weird because I've always appreciated how precious Tae was as a person, but over the past 6 1/2 years my feelings toward him have become slightly stronger. Yes I loved him since they debut. I always say stuff like \"I love Tae so much\" but atm, it feels like I'm in that stage right before you have a legit crush on someone..   Just looking at him makes me instantly happy.  Whenever he does something adorable, I sometimes get butterflies in my stomach (gosh this is so darn cheesy... if any of my family or school friends happen to read this, pls don't judge me... )   Everything about him brings me genuine happiness and his smile brightens my day.  I don't feel lonely when I watch videos of him or the rest of the boys. I really love how much they love ARMYs because it gives the fans a chance to feel close to them even if we live halfway across the world.  I've imagined what it would be like to be in a relationship with him... but I understand that I'm never going to be his girlfriend so to make it more practical, I think of how nice it would be if one day I had a boyfriend who was like him...    I always viewed Taehyung as someone who I wanted to be ultimate best friends with (and I still do!) but after I watched this ADORABLE video, I started to really think of him as bf material... SRSLY THO, THIS IS THE CUTEST VIDEO EVER! Look at the way he looks at her! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31  Maybe this is why I feel like I'm crushing on him... he's finally escaped my \"friendzone\" haha! But yeah, I've never felt this way towards an idol before; I've only ever developed crushes on people I've actually met... *Sigh* I don't even know. Maybe I'm just emotional today but writing this has made me happy. Taehyung makes me happy. I just really, really appreciate him as a person.  ",
