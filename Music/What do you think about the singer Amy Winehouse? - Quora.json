            "answer_text": "She was very talented but at the same time very self destructive. Her talent and her music genius rivaledher self destruction. She was diagnosed as depressed so she might have still resorted to drugs and alcohol even if she hadn\u2019t become a star. She was a beautiful, juicy, brunette and she ended up a skinny, tatooed freak. What a waste of youth and talent!!! I think she had stage fright. She was only 27 when she died and ironically enough she feared she would end up dead at that age!!! I was at home when i found out she died. It was late at night in July 2011. I was sad but not shocked. She was in a very bad shape and she cancelled her concert dates due to her alcohol and drug addiction. Her song \u2018\u2019 Back to black\u2019 is one of my favourites. Amy is truly missed. She could truly be one of the greats. She was a great composer and performer. RIP Amy.  ",

            "answer_text": "To me I hear a very talented singer, someone with a musical gift and the ability to authentically express a range of emotions. I was not a huge fan of this singer but I recognized the merit of her talent. I also think what an incredible shame and tragedy it is that she had to leave us so young, before she had really had the chance to fully develop her career-however she did experience success and wealth (I could be wrong, but I\u2019m pretty sure) which is something actually pretty rare. There are many talented people in this world who never ever get to take full flight, to express their abilities in a complete way. At least Ms Winehouse did taste the fruits of her own success. ",
