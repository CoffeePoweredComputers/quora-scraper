            "answer_text": "A wider vibrato can be intentional, if it\u2019s controlled, but intentional or not, it comes off as a wobble. I prefer natural vibrato, but a properly controlled one that is changed by support is sufficiently healthy. There is some variety in natural vibrato, but there is a standard speed of 6Hz that sounds better. The problem is that usually untrained singers will use a tension filled laryngeal vibrato, or a wobble that is created out of a place of tension, a forced vibrato, which then causes tightness in the jaw and the jaw to literally wobble up and down. This is NOT what you want. Natural vibrato should come only when the rest of the tension is removed. There is some laryngeal vibration, but it shouldn\u2019t be a visible up and down, more of a very slight jiggle in place. Found this video that demonstrates the differences between a vibrato, tremolo, caprino, and wobble.  ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a singer, but used to sing for a while, and have been trained accordingly. In my humble opinion it is not a Must. For any singer a real Must is to use the voice at best ability and to pick up songs accordingly. On another note, if I may advice, do professional training of the voice, with someone who has achieved or trained the types of the voices that you prefer to end up with. A good teacher is worth a weight of gold. Once I had 2h training by top singer for a TV show, and she opened my voice possibilities more then 8 years Jazz singing training ever did. Just 2 hours of targeted work. Voice is a muscle, and muscle can be trained. By someone who knows what he or she is doing. ",
