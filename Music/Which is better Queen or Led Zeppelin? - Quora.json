            "answer_text": "Both are great. So tie between them. For me its Led Zeppelin. But they aren\u2019t objectively better. Different person will choose differently. Both of them have two greatest hits - Stairway to Heaven (Led Zeppelin), Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen):So, both have upper-hand in this case. These two songs are considered as one of the greatest rock songs of all time. In fact, these two songs are ahead than any other song. While I\u2019d say Bohemian Rhapsody is more famous than Stairway to Heaven. Both song beat the other. An artist needs a very big hit. Both of them have this. So, in popularity both of them are famous.  2. Freddie Mercury is one of the greatest singers of all time and considered the greatest rock singer of all time. While Robert Plant takes second place:  Both of them are very popular. Both of them have great vocals. But in terms of talents Freddie Mercury is wins. Because he has a higher vocal range. He has vocal range closer to 5 octaves. He has more powerful voice and better control in voice. While Robert Plant is more influential. He even influenced Freddie Mercury. Though he\u2019s younger than Freddie Mercury. While his voice is very favorable. A lot of people will side as Robert Plant also. So, again tie with them in term of popularity. But this time I\u2019ll say Freddie Mercury. 3. Jimmy Page is considered as guitar god:  Yes. Both of them are famous. But Jimmy Page is more famous and more favorable. While I will say both of them have talent. Brian May has emotion in his solos and riffs. But Jimmy Page is always ahead in this case. He is on the first tier along with guitarists like Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton. While Brian May falls on the second tier. Both of them are talented though. But Jimmy Page wins. 4. John Bonham was a better drummer: If you are comparing who is better musician Roger Taylor or John Bonham? Then Roger Taylor. Cause he\u2019s more than a drummer. But for a drummer, John Bonham is better. He has better skills on drums. He is faster, heavier and more technical. So, John Bonham wins in drumming. 5. Both of them have great bassists: This time I won\u2019t side with popularity. Cause both of them were great. But I like John Deacon\u2019s basslines more than John Paul Jones. John Paul Jones is underrated as a member but not as a bassist While John Deacon is. Some of his basslines,   Both of these songs have great bassline. So, John Deacon wins. I don\u2019t care about popularity. 6. Both of them have very talented multi-instrumentalists: John Paul Jones for Led Zeppelin and Roger Taylor for Queen. John Bonham is very good at bass, keyboards and some other minor instruments. But Roger Taylor also is good at guitar, drums, vocals, keyboards. He\u2019s one of the greatest backing vocalists. He has almost same vocal skills as Freddie Mercury. Roger Taylor has higher vocal range than Robert Plant. So if you see even though he wasn\u2019t a regular singer but Queen\u2019s backing vocalist had greater vocals than Led Zeppelin\u2019s lead singer. So, his talent can\u2019t be ignored.  So, as a multi instrumentalist, Roger Taylor beats John Paul Jones. 7. Both of them have most overplayed songs: So, We Will Rock You and Stairway to Heaven both of them are overplayed and one of the catchy songs. 8. Both of them were important for developing rock music: So, both of them were influential and important for that time. Led Zeppelin created one heaviest songs with their blues inspired rock songs. Their albums were the heaviest albums of that time. Jimmy Page inspired many shred-guitarists. While Brian May with his guitar skills helped to develop metal music. Yes, Queen had metal albums. Especially their earliest albums. For example - Stone Cold Crazy is considered as the first thrash metal song.  So, as you could see when there were hardly much heavy metal bands at that time Queen created a thrash metal song. Extreme metal. Almost 10 years before Metallica. So, Queen was very important. While Led Zeppelin took part for creating heavy metal. Though they don\u2019t like heavy metal but they would be metal if there weren\u2019t death, black metal bands. Jimmy Page also inspired Johnny Ramone in punk rock.  His rapid downpicking riffs inspired Johnny Ramone to play downpicking riffs.  So, as you could see even though its not a metal song but its one of the earliest punk rock songs. Apparently even thrash metal guitarists use this kind of downpicking in their riffs. But they were inspired by Johnny Ramone. So, you could say they started it all. Conclusion: So, both of them wins. Both have upper-hands. While Led Zeppelin is more influential and more famous. So, they win in this case. But Queen was more original. I mean they didn\u2019t plagiarize songs. So, Queen wins this way. The choice is yours. So its subjectively one is better than other. Nothing could be say strictly. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two different questions here with different answers: Who were the better performers in their day (the 70s) when they were a going concern?Who is better now, about 50 years after both groups were founded?First before I say anything else, both bands were phenomenally talented with four superb musicians, and Freddie Mercury and Jimmy Page are both frequently considered contenders for the Greatest of All Time in their respective roles (which isn\u2019t to say that Roger Plant and Brian May aren\u2019t both among the best who ever lived). As far as musicianship goes, however, Queen have two significant advantages both on the songwriting front. The first is that Queen contained four first class songwriters, all of whom had No 1 hits. Not even The Beatles quite managed that. This diversity of songwriting gives them a breadth that pretty much can\u2019t be matched. And the second is that we can\u2019t talk seriously about Led Zepplin\u2019s songwriting without mentioning all the plagiarism allegations. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t matter so much in the moment but does for a long term assessment. Second, in their day, Led Zepplin owned. The early 1970s made them the biggest band since the Beatles and if I were setting a film in the early 70s. Queen meanwhile were big, but never truly broke America in their functional life as a band. Everywhere else, yes. But not geting America set a ceiling for them. Both had that touch of weirdness that made them worth listening to, but Queen were sometimes that bit too weird - and Freddie Mercury\u2019s closet door barely hanging off the hinges (I\u2019ve a personal theory that The Fairy Feller\u2019s Master Stroke had as one of its meanings him seeing just how blatantly he could say he was gay) and his death from AIDS was an issue. On the other hand in 2020 it\u2019s not even close. Queen had four outstanding songwriters and their music is everywhere. They are consistently in the top 50 overall bands on Spotify with more than twice the average listeners of Led Zepplin. They\u2019ve just had a major Oscar-winning biopic and have a fairly mediocre musical both carried on the back of their music. Freddie being gay really isn\u2019t an issue. And fundamentally I just don\u2019t hear Led Zepplin songs much outside classic rock stations these days with the sole exception of Immigrant Song and its primal scream (maybe the odd Stairway to Heaven or Black Dog). Queen? When the Muppets did a music video it was Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Day got their concert organised to it. We Will Rock You is obnoxiously popular. If I never hear We Are The Champions by a winning team rubbing it in again I\u2019ll be happy. I could easily go on with Under Pressure, Somebody To Love, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Who Wants to Live Forever and Don\u2019t Stop Me Now being half-assed soundtrack staples. Or to sum up, when I\u2019m looking for The Sound That Captured The Early 70s it\u2019s Led Zepplin. Queen are far closer to timeless and have endured in a way Led Zepplin haven\u2019t, very possibly pushing themselves to second on the Greatest Rock Band of All Time list (The Beatles are a pretty clear first place of course). That\u2019s different forms of greatness, but I\u2019ll take Queen as I\u2019m living in 2020. ",
