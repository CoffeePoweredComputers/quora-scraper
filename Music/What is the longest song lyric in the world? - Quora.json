Just check out the lyricsLook, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelingsBut I'm only going to get this one chance(Six minutes, six minutes)Something's wrong, I can feel it(Six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)Just a feeling I've gotLike something's about to happenBut I don't know whatIf that means, what I think it means, we're in troubleBig trouble. And if he is as bananas as you sayI'm not taking any chancesYou were just what the doctor ordered [Chorus:]I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap GodAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nodNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot [Verse 1:]But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genesI got a laptop in my back pocketMy pen'll go off when I half-cock itGot a fat knot from that rap profitMade a living and a killing off itEver since Bill Clinton was still in officeWith Monica Lewinski feeling on his nutsackI'm an MC still as honestBut as rude and as indecent as all hellSyllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hopYou don't really wanna get into a pissing matchWith this rappity-rapPacking a mack in the back of the Acbackpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yackand at the exact same timeI attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing thatI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' tableOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in halfOnly realized it was ironicI was signed to Aftermath after the factHow could I not blow? All I do is drop \"F\" bombsFeel my wrath of attackRappers are having a rough time periodHere's a Maxi-PadIt's actually disastrously badFor the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah [Chorus:]'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap GodAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nodNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard [Verse 2:]Everybody want the key and the secret to rapImmortality like I have gotWell, to be truthful the blueprint'sSimply rage and youthful exuberanceEverybody loves to root for a nuisanceHit the earth like an asteroidand did nothing but shoot for the moon since (PPEEYOOM)MC's get taken to school with this music'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'Now I lead a New School full of studentsMe? Me, I'm a product of RakimLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-W-A., Cube, hey, Doc, RenYella, Eazy, thank you, they got SlimInspired enough to one day grow upBlow up and being in a positionTo meet Run-D.M.C. and induct themInto the motherfuckin' Rock n'Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the churchAnd burst in a ball of flamesOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fameOn the wall of shameYou fags think it's all a game'Til I walk a flock of flamesOff a plank andTell me what in the fuck are you thinking?Little gay looking boySo gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face looking boyYou're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gatheringAnd take place looking boyOy vey, that boy's gayThat's all they say looking boyYou get a thumbs up, pat on the backAnd a \"way to go\" from your label every day looking boyHey, looking boy, what d'you say looking boy?I get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre looking boyI'mma work for everything I haveNever asked nobody for shitGit out my face looking boyBasically boy you're never gonna be capableof keeping up with the same pace looking boy, 'cause [Chorus:]I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap GodAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nodThe way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, NascarDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash GodKneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard [Verse 3:]So you'll be Thor and I'll be OdinYou rodent, I'm omnipotentLet off then I'm reloadingImmediately with these bombs I'm totin'And I should not be wokenI'm the walking deadBut I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatingBut I got your mom deep throatingI'm out my Ramen NoodleWe have nothing in common, poodleI'm a Doberman, pinch yourselfIn the arm and pay homage, pupilIt's meMy honesty's brutalBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilizeWhat I do though for goodAt least once in a while so I wanna make sureSomewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodleEnough rhymes toMaybe try to help get some people through tough timesBut I gotta keep a few punchlinesJust in case 'cause even you unsignedRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtimeI know there was a time where once IWas king of the undergroundBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grindSo I crunch rhymesBut sometimes when you combineAppeal with the skin color of mineYou get too big and here they come trying toCensor you like that one line I saidOn \"I'm Back\" from the Mathers LPOne when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from ColumbinePut 'em all in a lineAdd an AK-47, a revolver and a nineSee if I get away with it nowThat I ain't as big as I was, but I'mMorphin' into an immortal coming through the portalYou're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four thoughAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme forYou're pointless as RapunzelWith fucking cornrowsYou write normal, fuck being normalAnd I just bought a new ray gun from the futureJust to come and shoot yaLike when Fabulous made Ray J mad'Cause Fab said he looked like a fagAt Mayweather's pad singin' to a manWhile he play pianoMan, oh man, that was the 24/7 specialOn the cable channelSo Ray J went straight to radio station the very next day\"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you\"Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a humanWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhumanInnovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say isRicochet in off a me and it'll glue to youAnd I'm devastating more than ever demonstratingHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitatingNever fading, and I know that haters are forever waitingFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivatedI make elevating musicYou make elevator music\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"Well, that's what they doWhen they get jealous, they confuse it\"It's not hip hop, it's pop.\"'Cause I found a hella way to fuse itWith rock, shock rap with DocThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose itI don't know how to make songs like thatI don't know what words to useLet me know when it occurs to youWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus youIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' youHow many verses I gotta murder toProve that if you were half as nice,your songs you could sacrifice virgins toUnghh, school flunky, pill junkyBut look at the accolades these skills brung meFull of myself, but still hungryI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind toWhen I'm a million leagues above youIll when I speak in tonguesBut it's still tongue-and-cheek, fuck youI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheelI'm asleep in the front seatBumping Heavy D and the Boys\"Still chunky, but funky\"But in my head there's somethingI can feel tugging and strugglingAngels fight with devils andHere's what they want from meThey're asking me to eliminate some of the women hateBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I hadThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situationAnd understand the discriminationBut fuck itLife's handing you lemonsMake lemonade thenBut if I can't batter the womenHow the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?Don't mistake him for SatanIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseasAnd take a vacation to trip a broadAnd make her fall on her face andDon't be a retard, be a king?Think notWhy be a king when you can be a God?
