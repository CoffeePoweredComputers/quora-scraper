            "answer_text": "Yamaha HS5 is designed with purity in mind and intends to deliver crisp sounds of vibration, beats, every strum and vocal. Overview  This monitor tends to be a jack of all trades as far as good performance is concerned performing output far beyond most of its competitors. Turning up the volume with this quality studio monitor will bring a new experience and deliver tones and melodies at a level you just will not duplicate with most of the speakers in its class. A system of screws and specifically designed mounting ring, eliminates spurious vibration and resonance thus allowing the speaker to deliver its full Sonic potential. It has a standard performance as far as industry standards are concerned and a limited editions uniqueness that users really love. Hs5 have really taken the sound design to another level. Yamaha HS5 Features 1) Hs5 five measures 6.7 inches in width, 11.25 inches in height, 8.75 inches deep with a weight of Under 12 pounds.This just gives it versatility and mobility even in small spaces still offering powerful and crisp sound necessary for every production environment. 2) It has a low frequency driver of 5 inches in high frequency driver of 1 inches. 3)The frequency response is between 54 hertz to 30 kilohertz. 4) Output power 70 watts. 5) It has a 5 inch with 1 inch bi amplified Twitter.  Performance One of the hidden features of HS series monitors that you\u2019ll hear but are not likely to see is the extra large magnets. In combination with advanced magnetic circuit design, these magnets provides powerful uniform tightly controlled flux field that results in exceptionally smooth response and dynamic capabilities over a wider frequency range. Another feature that boosts woofer performance is a magnet selected to produce accurate solid low end response. The extra thickness of the of the tweeter frame also minimizes resonance that can interfere with high end clarity. Overall result is extraordinarily smooth most accurate response throughout the audio spectrum. In all with its sleek design along with awesome power behind it HS5 is on the list of every intermediate or beginner a producer. Bottom line All in all HS5\u2019s are great monitors that help a good audio mix along with a crisp and clear sound. I have seen HS5s in many professional studios. Also remember the performance of a monitor also depends on its key positioning, if you position it wrongly the frequency response will vary and you might get unwanted results. So learn about the art of positioning and how the frequencies behave and travel.  The mid EQ switch gives you subtle boost and cut options in addition to flat response, while the high trim switch offers the same type of response tailoring capability for the high frequency. Yamaha HS5 is really beautiful, aesthetically pleasant looking monitors which deliver crisp and beautiful sounds. the price of Yamaha HS5 is moderate and if you are willing to go for it I would suggest you to just go for it.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I'm sorry, but I tend to not talk about stuff I haven't had a chance to listen to. I can tell you a lot about the Yamaha NS10s, but don't know whether Yamaha were going for a modern active version of these, or if they've moved on entirely. All I can say, is that they're not a bad choice. In the meantime, I think you posted another question, comparing the KRK Rokit 5 with the Yam HS5. I can only recommend once again (or is this question older than the KRK vs HS5 one?) that you put your favourite critically-acclaimed well-produced songs (heaps of discussions on Quora about those) on a thumbdrive or CD, go to your nearest professional studio equipment dealership, and listen to those songs on every system that suits your budget. Listen to the low end: is it tight (good)? Does it linger on as if the kick drum head is abnormally loose (bad)?  Also, do the speakers reach low enough for your personal taste in sub-frequencies? Within your budget, it's hard to find speakers that extend properly below 40 Hz. Depending on the kind of music you produce, a sub-woofer might be helpful. Or, you could trust your Sony MDR7506 (or equivalent headphones) to tell you what's happening down to 20 Hz (even 10 according to specs), which not only costs a lot less, but also makes your neighbours much happier. How's the top end? Does it feel contrived, aggressive (baaaad)? Are the cymbals nice and sparkly, but not too much (good)? How's the stereo image - provided the speakers are set up in the shop so that you can really compare the pairs of speakers properly. A decent shop has them set horizontally as  Aleft-Bleft-Cleft-Dleft-Eleft-Fleft - Aright-Bright-Cright-Dright-Eright-Fright. Instead of  Aleft-Bleft-Cleft-Dleft-Eleft-Fleft - Fright-ERight-Dright-Cright-Bright-Aright  In the first setup, each pair forms a rather similar-size triangle with your head, whereas in the second setup, the stereo image of the A pair of speakers will sound far more impressive than that of the F pair squeezed together in the middle! So how's that image? Is each instrument well defined and punctual (good)? Or does each instrument seem to be coming from a nebulous, shifting position (baaaaaaad)? On a properly (pre-Loudness War) recorded drum kit, do the transients on the snare drum feel like they could punch a hole in a sheet of paper? Can you actually feel like that kick drum is there in front of you? Last but not least, can the speakers handle the kind of SPL at which you intend to listen to your music every now and then, to impress the client for instance? As most speakers are active now, they'll have a red LED on the front which will go off to let you know they're about to go into thermal protection. You should also hear that the LF driver is struggling to keep up. Again, no distortion at high SPL costs more money. I ran out of things to listen for, but that'll get you started. In the end, don't forget to listen with your heart. ",
