            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever heard Buckethead play. I saw a picture of him with that ridiculous hat he wears - it literally is a KFC chicken bucket - not much of a hat in my opinion, and it turned me the hell off. But I know he can play because of the caliber of people who have said he can play and play very well. When a guy gets accolades from the level of musicians he has, he can play. I just can\u2019t get excited about someone who wears a KFC bucket on his head. Why would you sabotage your own career like that? His one big weakness, image aside, is his songwriting. He may have hundreds of albums but how many have been successful? If the music you write only resonates with a tiny little niche audience, then you\u2019re hardly in the class of musicians who have written Smoke On The Water, Sweet Child Of Mine, Dream On, or Hotel California. Those are songs everybody knows and millions love. Buckethead has nothing in that category. Not to put the guy down, but I\u2019m just tellin\u2019 it like it is. There is being able to play technically difficult things, and then there\u2019s being able to create music that emotionally connects with people on a large scale. So he\u2019s one for two. ",

He won\u2019t be hitting the top 10 anytime soon, his stuff is bizarre. :) I\u2019ve got to like a guy who dresses that crazy on stage who can still play great. Even though his style isn\u2019t really anything like what I play and listen to, he\u2019s an outstanding player, very creative, with a lot of chops! Here\u2019s him doing some \u201cslap bass\u201d on the guitar, covering a Michael Jackson tune very crazily, and essentially producing sounds that may be coming from outer space!  ",
