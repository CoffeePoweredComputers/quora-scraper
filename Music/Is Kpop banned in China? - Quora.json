            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll quickly dispel Max Yang\u2019s dishonest and misleading answer. First, the Chinese government did crack down on Korean entertainment in China. In 2016, Korean entertainment products in China\u2019s music streaming services and TV networks were all banned. China also banned Korean companies from marketing in the country and forced its major internet cloud companies (i.e. Weibo) to cut ties with Korean companies. As well as ban all K-pop acts and concerts. The bans on streaming services and TV networks are lifted. However, there is still a partial ban on concerts and restrictions on Korean companies from operating freely in the country. Chinese companies are currently requesting their government to lift those bans most likely due to the global popularity of BTS and Blackpink, and the potential profit for hosting those acts in China. Could BTS Help Smooth Over China-Korea Relations? Second, Max Yang mentioned that it was China\u2019s nationalism and dignity that made Chinese consumers reject Korean entertainment rather than it being a government sanctioned restriction. He made some unspecified and very weak claims about Korean celebrities behaving poorly in China, or speak about China poorly (which for the Chinese equates to anything that isn\u2019t a complete and utter admiration of China as the epitome of perfection apparently). He couldn\u2019t give any significant examples. One thing you need to know about China is that its government has an almost absolute influence over its population. China\u2019s economic growth makes the government very popular among the Chinese and it fostered a massive bloating of Chinese ego; making them susceptible to believe just about anything that their government tells them as long as they promote \u2018the victim narrative\u2019. China has been doing this for awhile now. Making unfounded accusations about other countries being \u2018racist\u2019 or \u2018discriminatory\u2019 against the Chinese. Or inflate one or two examples as a reason for fostering the \u2018us against the world\u2019 sentiment.  The video above is a classical example of this. The Swedish police and the hotel staff just followed their procedure and the law, and the Chinese tourists screamed about police brutality and discrimination despite how gentle the officials involved were. So when the Chinese government started spouting obnoxious lies about Korean entertainment and Korea\u2019s exports to China, the Chinese population swallowed it up as always. They started using obscure examples as a way of saying \u201cKoreans hate us even though we have a bigger military, and we buy all their stuff!\u201d So incidents like this were commonplace in China:   Chinese entering Korean markets in China, causing property damage, and yelling at other Chinese to not shop there, or berating other Chinese for publicly listening to K-pop or using Korean products like Samsung/LG phones. Also massively posting negative online videos or social media comments about how much \u2018Korea sucks\u2019. All because South Korea wanted to install THAAD. Now does that sound reasonable to you? No? That is testament how much insane amount of control and influence the Chinese government has on its people. I would equate it to something akin to Trump supporters\u2019 unquestioned loyalty to Trump (as long as he doesn\u2019t screw the economy up too much, he\u2019s our guy! Because white people are victims of political correctness and can\u2019t say the N-word!). Third, as much as the Chinese seem to think that Koreans ought to be grateful to China because they buy our products, we\u2019ve proven that we don\u2019t really need them as much as they like to fancy. Since China\u2019s markets became inaccessible to Korean entertainment companies, they have started to aggressively expand into other markets in the world, and K-Pop is doing better than ever. (K-Pop Group BTS Is Seducing America, And We've Weirdly Got China To Thank For It) You\u2019ve seen how BTS sells out every single concert they hold everywhere they go (in seconds), tops almost every single music charts around the world, and have screaming fans of every ethnicity in nearly every country in the world. BTS is so huge that a Malaysian sports minister made it a priority for BTS to hold a concert there. (No more 'losing out to S'pore': M'sian minister pledges to bring in K-pop group BTS) I\u2019m guessing they have to offer some monetary incentives to lure them there to compete with larger venues that charge more for ticket prices in other countries. BTS also frequently promotes K-pop and Korean culture, leading to Korean entertainment value and revenue from tourism skyrocketing. So China\u2019s \u201ckill K-pop plan\u201d didn\u2019t exactly work out. The partial ban lifts are probably a recognition that there\u2019s nothing that the Chinese government can do about ending \u201cthe Korean Wave\u201d that they despise so much, and continuously keeping out K-pop might start to make them seem petty in the eyes of the Chinese. One last thing I wanted to add: Chinese and Japanese, and a lot of K-pop fans seem to think that we ought to be grateful for them liking or spending money on our culture or exports. I agree that it\u2019s a great phenomenon, but I want to remind you that the majority of Koreans don\u2019t really benefit from it, nor do we have to kiss your ass because of it. You don\u2019t see us sneering at the Chinese because we watch their film, buy their phones, or their food, or at the Japanese because we watch their anime, and we think they stepped out of line and behaved in an ungrateful manner. Do you expect Americans to kiss your ass because you watch their Hollywood movies? No? Then we\u2019re not going to live up to your expectations of Koreans becoming your personal footstools. I invite you kindly to suck a d*ck if you have that mentality. ",

            "answer_text": "it\u2019s a little bit complicated and interesting. Most Chinese believe that our government has limited the Korean entertainment in China from 13, July 2016. WHY? So far, no K-pop group has holden concerts or showcase in mainland China.No Korean idols has appeared on Chinese TV programs, either local or central TV. Even if there are Korean idols on the broadcasting show, these footages will be cut or covered with mosaics.Movies or TV dramas with Korean artists are no longer aired.Chinese brands no longer invite Kpop idols to speak for them.\u2026\u2026However, in fact, the relevant Chinese authorities have never explicitly promulgated the Korean Restriction Ordinance, which is considered to be the spontaneous patriotic movement of the Chinese people. Reasons for this phenomenon. THAAD(Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) issue. The deployment of THAAD in SK by The US causes a threat to China.SK's cultural aggression is not conducive to the development of Chinese culture and the ideological shaping of teenagers. \u2014\u2014We welcome excellent idols with respect to China, to open up market and earn money. But in fact, more and more SK idols with bad character come to China to make money at that time, and think that Chinese are rich but countrified. We were disgusted with this!Our Attitude? \u56fd\u5bb6\u9762\u524d\u65e0\u7231\u8c46\u3002This meas The fate of my nation outweighs my passion for my idol.As above mentioned, welcome good idols, reject bad ones.Some think this is a wise decision for many resons.For the vast majority of Chinese, there is no effect at all. Fans still support their idols by different ways\u2026\u2026 Going to Macau, HongKong, Taiwan even other countries to see concerts/buy albums/raise money\u2026\u2026.",
