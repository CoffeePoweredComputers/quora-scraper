            "answer_text": "How do drug companies come up with the names of prescription drugs? As someone who has actually led the development of new drugs along with naming them, maybe I can provide some insight. As others have mentioned, there are some rules that cover the chemical and generic names for all drugs. There\u2019s a little flexibility with generic names, but not that much. Brand names, on the other hand, are simply a marketing word (or words) for a drug to distinguish it from competitors or to make it memorable. A bunch of MBAs sit around a table, usually with consultants from advertising and marketing research companies, and try to develop a great name for a new drug or medical device. It\u2019s kind of fun, with a bunch of smart people in a conference room with pizzas, sodas, and, after hours, some beers and wine. However, there are limits to what we can do. The brand name has to be submitted to the FDA as part of \u201clabeling\u201d for the drug. The FDA approves all labeling, which includes literally the label on the packaging, advertising, package insert, marketing materials, and the trade name. Let\u2019s take a look at Viagra, since its history is one of the most amusing drug product development ever. It was drug developed for a certain type of hypertension, which it does treat, but the \u201cadverse effects\u201d for men were erections. When the drug was tested in Phase 1, which are almost always healthy young volunteers, this wasn\u2019t considered useful, because healthy young male volunteers usually aren\u2019t concerned about erections. And the researchers, who were also young, thought that it failed. It wasn\u2019t until one of the researchers looked into erectile dysfunction \u2013 they knew they had something. But I digress. The marketing team couldn\u2019t give the product a name like \u201cGuaranteed Woody,\u201d or \u201cErection pill.\u201d That would be making a claim for the product which the FDA wouldn\u2019t appreciate. Besides obvious name might make it sound like a fake treatment (physicians and patients are always skeptical of drugs, so a stupid name might make them even more so). So, the name \u201cViagra\u201d was developed. It kind of pushes the idea of \u201cvigor\u201d plus sounds vaguely medical. The name doesn\u2019t explicitly or even implicitly make a medical claim. But it kind of sounds like it does. Many other drugs do the same thing. \u201cAbilify\u201d is prescribed for depression, and it sounds like it empowers you. \u201cVarivax\u201d is the chickenpox vaccine, and it sounds like a vaccine. I love looking at names of new drugs, because I can see where they were going with the name. Anyway, inventing a new brand name for a drug is not easy. It takes some creativity to make it memorable, imply some action of the drug, and get FDA clearance for the name. Also, annoying upper management, that would be me, would always stick their noses into the process, never helping out. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "A generic, or nonproprietary name or the \"real\" name, given to a drug, pharmaceutical substance, or biologic product may be used by all who wish to refer to this substance. This differentiates it from the trade (brand) name, which is owned by the firm that markets a specific product.In the United States (US), the generic name is officially called the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and serves as an important and unique designation for the active ingredient.It appears with the company's trade name on drug labels, advertisements, and other information and is also requested on FDA applications and in drug substance chemical descriptions.The \"one substance, one name\" philosophy behind generic naming helps clearly identify the active substance across different brand or trade names, formulations, or in combination products.Unlike generic names, brand names vary from company to company and from country to country. Brand Names and Generic Names for Active Ingredients Brand: CialisGeneric: tadalafil Brand: Colemin, Lipex, Zocor, VytorinGeneric: simvastatin Brand: Gleevec, GlivecGeneric: imatinib mesylate How are names assigned? The process of assigning a USAN, referred to as a \"negotiation,\" begins when a pharmaceutical firm or its representative files an application to name the substance. It ends with the statement of adoption, a document that formally assigns a USAN to a specific substance.Before a statement of adoption is issued, the sponsoring firm, the USAN Council and the International Nonproprietary Names Expert Group (INN) must agree on a single name for the substance.The United States Adopted Name (USAN) considers several criteria in evaluating potential names:Whether the names reflect the drug action and fit the naming scheme?How well a name translates into languages other than English?How easy a name is to pronounce and remember?What do the names mean?Most new names consist of three parts: a prefix, an infix and a stem. Prefix: Means nothing; differentiates drug from others in classInfix: Used occasionally; further subclassifiesStem: Indicates place in nomenclature scheme; novel stems suggest novel drug action; drugs with the same stem are related.As an example, consider sildenafil (Viagra\u2122), vardenafil (Levitra\u2122), and tadalafil (Cialis\u2122). The -afil stem is formally defined as for PDE5 (phosphodiesterase 5) inhibitors. The -den- infix indicates that sildenafil and vardenafil have similar chemical structures. The prefixes are sil-, var- and tadal-. Pharmacologic families and Stems of some commonly prescribed and top-selling branded drugs are listed below Stem: -statLipitor\u2122 (atorvastatin calcium) meaning: enzyme inhibitorsStem subgroup: -vastatinCrestor\u2122 (rosuvastatin)meaning: inhibitors of HMG-CoA, an enzyme involved in synthesizing cholesterol Stem: -prazoleNexium\u2122 (esomeprazole magnesium)Prevacid\u2122 (lansoprazole)meaning: agents to treat ulcer and/or heartburn that are chemically related to benzimidazole Stem: -lukastSingulair\u2122 (montelukast)meaning: antiallergics and antiasthmatics that are leukotriene receptor antagonists Stem: -grelPlavix\u2122 (clopidogrel sulfate)meaning: platelet aggregation inhibitors Stem: -axineEffexor XR\u2122 (venlafaxine hydrochloride)meaning: antianxiety, antidepressant inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake Stem: -oxetineCymbalta\u2122 (duloxetine hydrochloride)meaning: antidepressants with a chemical structure related to fluoxetine Stem: -sartanDiovan\u2122 (valsartan)meaning: angiotensin II receptor antagonists Stem: -oxacinLevaquin\u2122 (levofloxacin)Meaning: antibiotics that are chemical derivatives of quinolone Stem: -virValtrex\u2122 (valacyclovir)meaning: antiviral compoundsstem subgroup: -cyclovirmeaning: chemical structure is related to acyclovir Stem: -mabAvastin\u2122 (bevacizumab)meaning: monoclonal antibodiesstem subgroup: -zumabmeaning: humanizedinfix: -ci- for circulatory system targets (e.g. inhibiting angiogenesis) Remicade\u2122 (infliximab)meaning: monoclonal antibodiesstem subgroup: -ximabmeaning: chimericinfix: -li- for immune system targets There are few prefixes and infixes with specific, defined meanings, some of which have been used to coin names for top-selling drugs. Ar-, es-, lev- and dex- are used to name stereoisomers of drugs. For example, esomeprazole is a stereoisomer of omeprazole.Peg- means that a biologic substance, such as peptide, is pegylated. -Io- has been used as an infix to suggest a high iodine content (amiodarone).When -fos- appears anywhere in a drug name, the element phophorous is present, often as a phosphate ester.These are few rules that are used while naming a drug. However, this area is very dynamic and nothing is set in stone. The nomenclature practices will continue to evolve as new substances are developed and marketed by the pharmaceutical industry.
