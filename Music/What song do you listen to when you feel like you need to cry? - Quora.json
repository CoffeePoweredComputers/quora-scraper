            "answer_text": "I usually listen to this song Hell - Sophia Kao  The writer writes the lyrics with fully emotional lyrics i\u2019ve ever heard. With the acoustic sound and minor chords makes me feel like i\u2019m going to cry tonight. The song talks about how we hate our partner is leaving, anytime sooner. And the writer wants to do anything to keep their relationship together. However, it breaks my heart to remember how i see my girlfriend talks to other guy, or hangout with them. I just can\u2019t handle my feelings, i\u2019m jealous. The other song is I Don\u2019t Wanna Be Okay Without You - Charlie Burg  This song describe how you feel when you lose your partner. The lyric is too deep for me because i really can feel it. How can i be okay without her? I feel like she is stuck in my head. It\u2019s hard to believe that your partner is leaving you behind and won\u2019t come back. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever heard Peter Gabriel\u2018s \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up\u201c? If you want to cry it\u2019s usually because you\u2019re already sad. This song not only reinforces the feeling of crying but also tenderly supports you through whatever you\u2019re going through. Don\u2019t give up; don\u2019t give up; don\u2019t give up. It\u2019s a song of failure but at the same time a song of hope. This is the kind of song I like to listen to when I\u2019m down and want to cry but also need the encouragement. By the way, the only song I ever actually cried while listening to was \u201cif Leaving Me is Easy\u201c by Phil Collins. It was right after a break up with a girlfriend that took me years to get over. It seems like I\u2019m there again but I find it hard to cry. Oh well, that\u2019s life I guess. ",
