            "answer_text": "When vinyl heats up, it becomes soft. Pressure on the vinyl, including the album\u2019s own weight, can cause it to warp. It is very important to store your records properly so that they don\u2019t warp. Keep them away from heat, and also be sure to avoid leaving them in direct sunlight. I do not advise playing records with more than a slight warp on a good turntable, or a turntable that you plan to play good records on in the future without replacing the stylus. This is because playing a warped record puts excessive pressure on the cantilever (the cantilever connects the needle to the cartridge). If this becomes damaged, your records will too. If your needle is jumping off of the vinyl, then it is probably time to look for another copy of that album. However, if you\u2019d still like to play a very warped album, I have found that 60\u2019s/70\u2019s BSR turntables and the like do a nice job playing warped records. I\u2019m guessing that this is because of the heavy tracking force that they use.  ",

            "answer_text": "Traditional product PVC has a maximum operating temperature around 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) when heat distortion begins to occur. Melting temperatures range from 212\u00b0F to 500\u00b0F (100\u00b0C to 260\u00b0C) depending upon manufacture additives to the PVC. Vinyl is \u201cV\u201d in PVC and its the same thing. So, when vinyl records get too hot, they start to loose their shape. They warp. ",
