            "answer_text": "The dark chord progressions can cultivated from within the harmonic minor scales. To keep the darkness flowing and evolving it is good to modulate into other harmonic minor keys. The resolution of chord motion within and between the harmonic minor scales can become a never ending journey. The Roman numerals are used to show the order of the modes. The Arabic numerals show the order of the notes within the modes. The mode names are included. Here is an example of the harmonic minor scale, modes and chords in the key of C. The scale/modes are shown in octaves to complete the sound of the modes. The Roman numerals and the mode names are the same for every harmonic minor scale. The only difference is the start point of the scale. They may be difficult to remember but once you learn them, you own them! C harmonic minor: notes 1C,2D,3Eb, 4F, 5G, 6Ab, 7B,8C. The modes: I Tonic minor 1C, 2D, 3Eb, 4F, 5G, 6Ab, 7B, 8C. II Locrian nat13 1D, 2Eb, 3F, 4G, 5Ab, 6B, 7C, 8D. III Ionian#5 1Eb, 2F, 3G, 4Ab, 5B, 6C, 7D, 8Eb. IV Dorian#11 1F, 2G, 3Ab, 4B, 5C, 6D, 7Eb, 8F. V Mixolydian b9, b13 1G, 2Ab, 3B, 4C, 5D, 6Eb, 7F, 8G. bVI Lydian#9 1Ab, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5Eb, 6F, 7G, 8Ab. VII Diminished 1B, 2C, 3D, 4Eb, 5F, 6G, 7Ab, 8B. VII Tonic minor 1C, 2D, 3Eb, 4F, 5G, 6Ab, 7B, 8C. The strongest chords are the I and V chords you can experiment to get get the best results. Create progressions and superimpose the melodies for a deep experience. The chord tones are the 1, 3, 5, and 7 notes. The 2, 4, and 6 notes can be used for embellishment. Check for compatibility when adding them to your chords. The harmonic minor scale is a great playground complete with emotion, pathos, and triumph. You can weave a tapestry of dark magic within these chords especially if you modulate to other harmonic minor keys. Once you can navigate the elements of one harmonic minor scale, you have the ability to navigate all of them. The Roman/Arabic numerals and mode label features are the same for all the harmonic minor scales. As you add the harmonic minor scales to your inventory, you can move within and between scales to create a wide variety of musical expressions. Have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Dark chord progressions? The most popular chord progressions generally I IV and V. With I being the root or the key a particular song is in. However that's just the progression of the chords and has little to do with the tone of a particular song. Most \u201cdark\u201d songs are written in minor keys. The chord progression is similar to a light pop song. Example Simon and Garfunkles' \u201cSound of Silence\u201d some may consider it a \u201cdark song\u201d Its key is E Flat Minor or D#minor but a very common chord progression. Likewise Darth Vadors theme song if put in a major key say the key of G is very upbeat. Chord progressions are dark in nature however the root key determines the feel of a song. As chord progress to that particular key and they usually the rout of IV, V, or VII of that. And if its a Minor, diminished, or dimemted, chord then the song will be a \u201cdark\u201d sounding song. Its not so much about the progressions as the key the song is played in. ",
