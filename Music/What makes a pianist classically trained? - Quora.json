            "answer_text": "\u2018Classical\u2019 music, by which I think you mean \u2018art music\u2019 rather than just music of the classical period (C. 1750 - 1828) requires some very refined and specific techniques and knowledge in order to realise its creative intentions. Evenness of tone in every finger, clear articulation, control of dynamics, sensitivity to phrasing, rhythmic accuracy, understanding of the composer\u2019s musical intentions and of the requirements of different styles. They will play almost entirely from written music. Students take piano lessons in order to develop these things. Often they will go through an exam programme such as the ABRSM, Trinity College or the LCM in order to way mark their progress and develop each skill as they go along. The most important element for progress is targeted practice of specific skills by learning example pieces in different styles and levels of complexity. Students will also undergo a programme of exercises such and learn to play scales and arpeggios in different keys. It is important to understand that this is only one approach to music making. Others that might lead to performance styles such as Rock, Pop or Jazz might require the practice of other skills and these may be learned less formally (although there are teachers who teach these styles and also some excellent learning systems for them). I have found that many students who follow the classical path find improvisation, syncopation, and chord chart reading quite difficult (not all, some can do both) while those who have studied less formally find reading from music slower and more tedious.

            "answer_text": "Honestly, \"classically trained\" tends to refer to people who are not trained anywhere near the level they'd need to be to become classical musicians. People who are actually trained well enough to have become pros have other, more specific indicators in their bios, like \"won the [insert major competition]\" or \"studied with [insert major teacher].\" The people who say \"classically trained\" are mostly people who want you to understand that they (probably briefly) took it seriously, and weren't just messing around.

He should also be able to play a number of real classical masterpieces. At least Fur Elise, and maybe a couple of Chopin Nocturnes, or some Bach inventions.  I tell people I'm classically trained to separate myself from the scores of pianists who just mess around and play by ear. It basically means I took intense lessons in serious music.  If I feel like making a bigger impression, I'll say a bit more. Like, my piano teacher played at Carnegie Hall, or Dr. so-and-so said he envied my technique, or I was the professional accompanist for this choir, and so on. Usually I just say I'm classically trained so they know I'm not just picking out ditties in my sleep. Then I might play them a tune or two. ",

They have very different ways of approaching music. ",
