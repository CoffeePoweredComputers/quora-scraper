            "answer_text": "I agree with Samantha ( \u30b5\u30de\u30f3\u30bf) Keyes in her analysis. But here\u2019s my take on it: The best songs of J-pop are on par with K-pop, but they are hidden within plain sight for reasons below. The perception of laypeople regarding J-pop is more or less just female idols, anime songs and nothing else. But this is a stereotype that few people realize that it\u2019s untrue. The problems with the execution of Cool Japan which promotes these kind of music overseas exacerbates this problem. For a long time, J-pop suffers from accessibility issues. The problem still persists today, but it\u2019s no longer as severe as certain Quorans like to claim. But thanks to the issue happening so long, the inertia leads to people not bothering with it other than knowing the aforementioned stereotype. There\u2019s also the fact that K-pop idols have to train for years prior to debuting, in contrast of J-pop idols who are pretty much thrown into the stage with little to no training. As a result, J-pop idols get a bad first impression and pretty much dead on arrival when it comes to attracting overseas fans, which somewhat spills over to other J-pop artists regardless of quality. Instead of pondering the answers of this question, you should discover J-pop on your own pace over your favorite music streaming websites or YouTube and see which kind of J-pop appeals to you. ",

            "answer_text": "K-Pop is not so much better than J-Pop, it\u2019s actually all about perspective. The main appeal of kpop, is the fact that the idols are perfect and can do no wrong. They don\u2019t need to improve, because they are showcased as perfect. In this doing, however, it becomes quite risky because any scandal can terminate them completely. The main appeal of jpop, is improvement. It\u2019s exploring your artistry. Jpop can\u2019t showcase as much as kpop, because they take more time to do quality stuff. Kpop doesn\u2019t need this latter appeal, because everything is pre-done for them. The amount of idols who really want to explore their musicality within the industry is limited. Japan is very much more diverse than Kpop when it comes to music, so the fandom is very divided. This creates the illusion it is difficult to find good music, when it\u2019s right in front of you. A lot of people can\u2019t see the modern jpop, because they are caught up in the \u201cthey\u2019re so cute\u201d stigma. A lot of the mainstream kpop is shoved in your face, and they all play it safe to get a major hit, therefore hindering the production of great artistry. A lot of people can\u2019t see the best kpop, because there\u2019s a stigma that it\u2019s all the same. To end this, here are a few kpop and jpop recs, alternating from one to the other. Note: I\u2019m not comparing, I thought it would be cool to alternate to give you a fresh start every time. Note number 2: I do realize I can\u2019t put everything here, so yes, some of it is mainstream. And yes, it\u2019s good mainstream for me.
