            "answer_text": "I think so and I guess the best way to illustrate this is to share my own musical experience through the years. Besides, I agree totally with previous posts who remarked we forgot the less savory older pop music. Nevertheless, we used to have a more diverse and sophisticated pop scene, because the music was greater than the pop and the show than the business. As a 70s/80s kid, I must say I\u2019ve only recently started to not enjoy newer pop music, at least the majority of it. I got bored because of mainly 3 ongoing (everlasting?) aspects of today\u2019s pop : overall vulgarity (image, lyrics), lack of artistic value (musically poor tunes), lack of proper singing (many hits being actually more spoken than sung). I started thinking, very seriously, I had just grown older. As a kid, I was exposed to a huge lot of music, both classical and pop. My father played instruments, worked in an opera house and listened to either 60s-70s pop/rock or classical all day long at home. I liked many genres from a very young age, and kept this interest for a very long while, until the early 2010s, to be precise. Only recently, I started to appreciate music again thanks to Tokio Hotel, but that\u2019s just personal. I will say why later. Prior to that, the last band to make a really big impression on me was Nirvana. Yes, eclectic but precise. As a teenager, I became infatuated with British pop to start with. It was the early 80s and a magical time when many genres started to blossom or evolve into something much bigger than just music. It was researching and redefining personal development in a way, through not only music but also fashion, societal values, lifestyle, and this brought great hope for evolution to the youngster I was. Artists as diverse as Boy George (Culture Club), Depeche Mode, Kate Bush, Duran Duran, George Michael (then Wham!), Sade, Simply Red, UB40, Madness, Sting (then Police), The Stranglers, Bronski Beat, etc\u2026 and even some one-hit wonder artists all made their own artistic statement brilliantly and in a very unique manner. Please compare this with today\u2019s tracks and tell me how I\u2019m biaised. I also loved American pop music\u2026 all very original, too\u2026 in a very short amount of time, genres as diverse as disco, punk, new wave, funk and house appeared, alongside various types of rock music, reggae, rap and everything in between all rubbing shoulders on radio and tv. Madonna, Prince, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, The Bangles, Bon Jovi\u2026 all started in that same period of time. Again, what a diversity! It was a lot of fun, picking up music to suit my mood of the day just like choosing what to wear! This is nearly impossible today. Most of the music sounds very similar. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s made by businessmen rather than artists. We did get a glimpse of that back in the day with Stock Aitken and Waterman which produced hits and pop stars quite industrially in the late 80s\u2026 I think they were or should be considered a kind of lab of what was to come a generation later (actually, the one that grew up to that type of music seems to have brought it back as adults). It\u2019s all about making big money and having the right marketing strategy to that effect ; being what it is, the pop music industry not only sells music but also an image of dreamy fashion and life-styles, or rather nowadays, fantacized success stories of big fat money, lust and ease to the hard-working-class masses, much to the detriment of the original art at this point in musical history. As Nirvana disappeared, I moved to Japan. Not because of that, just because of my studies, quite coincidently. I discovered J Pop and K Pop that are all the rage now, at least in Asia, a generation before it became even known in Europe. It opened me to a much cleaner and classier approach to pop music, favored in non-Western nations, albeit not a more creative one. They also produce dreams for the masses, without the luridness but with the big money business in mind. (For those interested to know why Tokio Hotel: Tokio Hotel appeal to me because I find them really artistic, the kind of artists that lift your dreams and enhance your experiences in life to an upper level. Their albums and style evolve in parallel to their lives, they feel very genuine in their creativity. They write and compose great lyrics and music. They are also fantastic performers. Furthermore, they have style. In other words, they bring back good pop music making to our times. They experiment and take risks like the artists used to and should do. And that is so rare these days. The fact that they are based in the US probably gives them an edge technically, while being uninvolved with the mainstream international hits mass production, they retain their individuality. OK, it\u2019s just a matter of personal taste, but please think about your choices when you want great music + no vulgarity + style + youth + artistic talent + creativity. There\u2019s a lot of bashing them in Germany especially, and I think it\u2019s a good sign, because they get the haters treatment typical of great names... In their own countries, Abba, Depeche Mode or David Guetta all were subject to that type of journalistic bullying at the peak of their breakthrough! Of course, there are other talented artists, but I kept the example down to my own sensitivity. So in conclusion, yes, in my experience, there is generally much less sophistication in pop music acts now than in the past, and I finally think it\u2019s not only due to my age. ",

            "answer_text": "Not always. A lot of the music we don\u2019t remember from that era was very simple, unsophisticated and ripped off the popular trends. Such as ballads, country, be-bop and rock and roll. How many times have we heard this style for instance\u2026 Rosie & the Originals - Angel Baby What about the Pachelbel Canon chord progression? What about disco? Rock music however was more sophisticated during the 60s and 70s. It was really a golden era in terms of experimentalism in rock music. This was an era of social change and experimentalism. One more thing that is that minimalism or sound synthesis was not yet a popular influence in pop and rock. Not until Kraftwerk and Disco came along and popularised the minimalistic dance-based form. Before then, music was melody dominated. Kraftwerk came along with hits such as The Model and showed that pop music can be minimal and primarily rhythmic. ",
