            "answer_text": "Nobody really knows. We know more or less what instruments the Viking-era people used: six-stringed lyres, bone and wooden flutes, reed instruments possibly similar to the Russian zhalejka, and blowing horns made from wood or cow-horns. There\u2019s a find from Hedeby that looks to be a rebec (a spoon-shaped fiddle with three strings). They may also have played bowed lyres, something like the Swedish talharpa or Finnish jouhikko; there\u2019s one depicted in a carving on Trondheim Cathedral, although that\u2019s a bit post-Viking as such. English manuscripts of the time depict some of these instruments. Here\u2019s King David on lyre and his backing horn section and dancers, from the 8th century Vespasian Psalter, now in the British Museum. Even though the original King David would have played a different kind of lyre, the Anglo-Saxon artists depicted him with the kind of instrument that they were familiar with.  That\u2019s obviously a Christian manuscript, but the pagan Norsefolk knew very similar instruments. There are fragments of lyres, for example, known from Viking-era Hedeby, Ribe, and a Swedish site called Halla Broa. This is a lyre bridge carved out of amber from Halla Broa on Gotland, now in the Swedish Historical Museum. (Source: Historiska museet) :  A lyre was probably buried with the chieftain whom Ibn Fadlan witnessed being buried on the Volga River; he called it a tunbur, but it was almost certainly this kind of lyre. It\u2019s been possible to reconstruct this lyre from both artistic depictions and archaeological finds: here\u2019s one, based on the remains from the great tomb at Sutton Hoo, England (https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&assetid=269705001&objectid=1496825) :  This is quite playable\u2014it\u2019s limited to six pitches, but that\u2019s enough for plenty of melodies, and various playing techniques (fingerpicked, plucked with a plectrum, string-blocking from behind like King David is doing) mean you can get a lot of music out of it. The problem is that we don\u2019t have any notated music from the Viking Age. But the medieval music specialist Benjamin Bagby has tried to reconstruct it. This is of necessity an imaginative reconstruction; we can\u2019t know what the tunes were (and some scholars are dubious as to whether the Eddic poems were sung at all). But we do know what the instruments were capable of, and Bagby takes folk-inspired musical motifs and uses them to create an accompaniment that hopefully catches the sprit of the work. His ensemble Sequentia recorded an album of Old Norse poetry from the Poetic Edda, sung or chanted to harp and fiddle. Here they are performing verses 138\u2013145 of the poem H\u00e1vam\u00e1l in Old Norse. In this part, Odin himself is telling how he sacrificed himself to himself, hanging for nine nights, to win knowledge of the runes.

(A very brief commercial: If you\u2019re curious what the above means in English, why not check out H\u00e1vam\u00e1l: A New Translation?) And here\u2019s Bagby performing lines 194 to 216 of Beowulf. (The still pictures in the video show him playing a triangular frame harp and what I think is a hurdy-gurdy, which were generally later than the Vikings. At 1:00, the picture shows him playing the older style of lyre.) This part is about how Beowulf hears news of Grendel\u2019s ravaging of Hrothgar\u2019s realm, chooses men to go with him, and sails from southern Sweden to Denmark.  \u00fe\u00e6t fram ham gefr\u00e6gn Higelaces \u00feegn, god mid Geatum, Grendles d\u00e6da; se w\u00e6s moncynnes m\u00e6genes strengest on \u00fe\u00e6m d\u00e6ge \u00feysses lifes, \u00e6\u00feele ond eacen.

There are some other ensembles that play reconstructed Viking music, such as \u201cDet Ljomar av Viking!\u201d (It Sounds Like a Viking!\u201d) from Norway: Vikingmusikk (web site in Norwegian only, I fear). Here they are in a photo courtesy of the Kulturhistorisk Museum, University of Oslo, with bukkehorn, lyre, and wooden flute:  The Danish band Krauka also plays Viking music, although sometimes they use modern instruments. This is a good track, but I\u2019m pretty sure the Vikings didn\u2019t play electric bass or flatback bouzouki. . .  Their rendition of a Faroese ballad, \u201cOrmurinn langi\u201d (\u201cThe Long Serpent\u201d, the name of Olaf Tryggvason\u2019s enormous flagship) is a bit more traditional.  ",
