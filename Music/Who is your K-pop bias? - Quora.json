            "answer_text": "My bias is RM (Kim Namjoon) from BTS. I wasn\u2019t actually a big fan of K-POP. I have two friends who were fans of BTS before I was. They were constantly talking about BTS and listened to their songs 24/7. I remember they listened to \u201cFire\u201d. I was so annoyed that I told them the song was lame. Now it is one of my favorite songs. One day we were having lunch and my friends started talking about BTS. I didn\u2019t pay attention that much, because I didn\u2019t understand. I only knew Jimin and V, because they are the biases of my friends. Sometimes I heard about Jungkook and the only song I knew was DNA. One of my friends had a bag with the pictures of the members of BTS. Suddenly my other friend said: \u201cI don\u2019t like Rap Monster. He is ugly.\u201d When I heard her saying that, I got angry. I hate it when people order other people with their beauty. That was the first time I heard about Rap Monster, who now is RM. But I felt really close to him. With that anger I came out a bit too loud and said: \u201cYou can\u2019t hate somebody just because he is ugly! And that is your opinion. I personally think he is handsome, even if I\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d My friends we\u2019re in shock because of my sudden behavior. \u201cCalm down, I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d My friend said. Then my other friend said: \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like them.\u201d I was calmer then before and told them: \u201cI don\u2019t not like them, but just don\u2019t know them.\u201d After school, in the evening I did a search on BTS and RM. I became to know that we have the same intereses. Two days later I came to school with a different feeling. I told my friends who are ARMY that I really liked their music and all the other things. The whole day long I\u2019ve been talking about BTS and the things I knew about RM. At the end of the day my friend told me I was on my way to become an ARMY. Since then I know myself as an ARMY. After the conversation between my friends and me, I love RM for who he is. That\u2019s the reason he is my bias and I believe it is a different and unique way of loving him. ",
