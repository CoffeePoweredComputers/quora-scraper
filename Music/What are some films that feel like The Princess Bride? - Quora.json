            "answer_text": "There aren\u2019t many. The one I can think of that\u2019s similar is the adaptation of Neil Gaiman\u2019s novel Stardust. It also has pirates, beautiful women, heroes, farm boys, witty dialogue, and a vicious (this time female) villain.  Directed by Matthew Vaugh, IMDb summarises it as: In a countryside town bordering on a magical land, a young man makes a promise to his beloved that he'll retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the magical realm. There\u2019s also some masterful performances from Pfeiffer, Danes, de Niro, and Charlie Cox in his pre-Daredevil days. It\u2019s charming, funny, neatly plotted, and has the closest tone to The Princess Bride, which really captured lightning in a bottle. ",
