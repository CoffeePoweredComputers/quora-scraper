Feel the air as you inhale and it begins to fill up your upper thighs and lower abdomen. B) Relax your tongue. Release it forward into your lower teeth and let is settle there. C) Raise the soft palate at the back of the mouth. Here\u2019s the feeling you should go for: Yawn. But stop before you actually start to exhale. Feel that stretch in your palate at the back of your tongue? Feel how you\u2019ve created an arch in your upper jaw? D) Sing. ",

            "answer_text": "This is kind of hard to explain but I\u2019m bored so I\u2019m going to try anyway. You know when you\u2019re singing and you try to hit a note and you feet it sort of hit a wall at the back of your throat or possibly in your nose? Try to push past that wall and go deeper and then your voice will sound more open. Take deeper breaths beforehand, try not to be shy or embarrassed and don\u2019t be afraid to push your voice to see how far it will go. You\u2019ll know when you went too far because your voice will crack. Good luck! ",
