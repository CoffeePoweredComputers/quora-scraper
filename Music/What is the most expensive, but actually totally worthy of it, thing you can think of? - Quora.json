It\u2019s fun but also very educational in so many ways.Charity. We haven\u2019t built a church or even a small sacristy, but the overall feeling of helping people is worth infinitely more than the money we have contributed.Our houses. We have always bought houses on the water (lake, bay, and the ocean). They always cost more than comparable non-water houses, but the view, the experience, and the resale have all made living on the water incredibly worthwhile.Our cars. Early on, we learned to buy really well made cars that last a long time. They may be more expensive in the short term, but in the long run, they are SO worthwhile both in terms of acquisition money spent, maintenance costs, and resale value.",
