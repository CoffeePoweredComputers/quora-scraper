            "answer_text": "Yes. Musically, what Presence offers is a collection of songs that, to me, sounds tired and therefore hard to keep focus upon. That feeling was inconceivable in their past records, even if filled with songs 20 minutes long or so. The level of emotion in Zep's music always kept me interested all the way through. We can find many reasons behind that change. Presence wasn't recorded under normal circumstances. Robert Plant had a car accident and was on a wheel chair. His voice has also changed over the years and would never get back to its early form. The band also was facing internal struggles and the very publicized alcohol and chemical abuse. Someday all that would arise to the music, and that was the time. That's not to say, however, that this is an all bad record. It has its moments - the first track, Achilles Last Stand, being the greatest of them. A fantastic song that even shows new paths for the band's sound. Something more progressive, technical but still heavy. And Robert\u2019s voice had fit very well. All that said, I still suggest anyone to hear the record and take their own impressions. After all it's a Zeppelin record. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you something: Presence is a damn good album. Perfect like their previous albums? No. No group can continue to produce records at that level forever. The band was going through a lot difficulty during its making. Yet they still managed to put together a quality album with a few outstanding songs: \u201cFor Your Life,\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s Fault but Mine,\u201d \u201cTea For One.\u201d Did it have a couple clunkers? Yes. But Zeppelin B-sides are like the Beatles B-sides: still pretty good. And \u201cIn Through the Out Door?\u201d Ditto: \u201cIn the Evening,\u201d \u201cFool in the Rain,\u201d \u201cAll My Love,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Crawl.\u201d So it\u2019s foolish to think 1976 was the end of their greatness. And you know what? When I reach for Zeppelin, those two albums are the first two I grab. I\u2019ve listened to the others so many hundreds of times apiece. These days, I like to dig a little deeper, reacquainting myself with \u201cAchilles Last Stand\u201d over \u201cStairway\u201d or \u201cWhole Lotta Love.\u201d My appreciation continues to grow. ",

            "answer_text": "By consensus, Led Zeppelin\u2019s peak was their fourth album. However, I thought Houses of the Holy was thoroughly brilliant. No complaints - not sure which of them I\u2019ve enjoyed the most. Led Zeppelin started their trend down hill with Physical Graffitti - although two of the sides were very much worthwhile, even those songs do not hold up to as many repeated playings as any side of their two masterpieces - or even their first three albums, probably. (Perhaps, I\u2019m weird, but I have always found \u201cKasmir\u201d to be a boring dirge with a tired worn out Robert Plant taking a crap on the song\u2019s bridge.) Then came Presence. For my wiring and musical experiences, I have to agee with Chip Gilchrist, not Bradley Linn. It just didn\u2019t do anything for me. However, I will agree with Bradley on In Through the Out Door - not a masterpiece, but a very fine comeback. ",

I never understood why there is so much hate for Presence, it's a hella great underrated album, I guess people are just impatient to dig deeper. I also never got why everyone thinks that LZ 4 is their peak, for me their most perfect record is third album. ",
