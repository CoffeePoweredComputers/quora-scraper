            "answer_text": "Yes! As mentioned, a compressor reduces dynamic range, making soft sounds louder and loud sounds softer. You can compress a source so severely that all the sounds are essentially the same volume, no dynamic range. If there are specific elements in the background you are interested in and other sounds are inconsequential, an equalizer can be a good tool to help zero in on the subject of interest. Multiband Compressors or Dynamic Equalizers are even more specialized, and at times can be quite helpful as well. Spectral editors like Izotope RX-5 or RX-6 may be used to extract the subject of interest from the audio track, discarding everything else in the final render. ",
