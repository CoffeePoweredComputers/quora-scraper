With your Zoom settings adjusted all you need to do is start playing the music you wish to include in your class. This could be via a streaming service (Spotify, Apple music etc.) or directly from a CD or file but it must be played via the device you are using for your Zoom call. HOPE it helps \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 ",
