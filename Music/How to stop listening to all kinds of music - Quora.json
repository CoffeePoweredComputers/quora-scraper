            "answer_text": "A lot of people might not understand, but I can relate to this feeling. I\u2019m actually still in the process of trying to stop, but I have really improved from where I was before. Honestly, the reason I wanted to stop listening to music was not only because of religion, but I noticed that it was all I could think about. All day, everyday, all that would go through my head were songs to the extent I could not focus or learn properly. Before it used to be something I could submerge myself into, my safe haven, but it just ended up wrecking my grades and messing with my life as well as feelings. In fact, I would usually end up feeling more depressed after. The first thing to do is to delete all the music from your devices. I now this might sound hard, but if you really want to stop listening to them, you have to delete them. So, next time you have the urge to listen to a song and you realize that you don\u2019t have them at easy access, you just end up not listening to them. If that doesn\u2019t work and you end up searching it up on YouTube or Spotify or whatever you may use, delete it. I understand that some people can\u2019t delete YouTube (?), so in that case, create a new account and only subscribe to channels that have productive content. I would also advise guilting yourself. Keep a sticky note in a convenient place and every time you find yourself listening to music, make a mark on the paper for every \u201csin\u201d. Every time you write a stroke on that paper, you feel a sense of guilt. It is also a great way to track your progress, since at first you might lapse quite a lot (hence, more \u201csins\u201d), but then after a while, you will be able to see much more improvement. Distract yourself. Keep yourself busy, get into a fandom, read some books, try a sport, learn a new language. It\u2019s going to be really hard at first, but it\u2019ll get easier. Sometimes you might give in to the urge to listen to music (and end up regretting and mentally giving yourself a sound trashing), but if you have the mindset to do it, then you will succeed. Lot\u2019s of people might wonder \u201cwhy in the world would you want to give up listening to music?\u201d, but as long as you know what\u2019s best for your mental and spiritual health, then its better to avoid it, than indulging in it and regretting it later. Best of luck! Edit 12.04.2019 I also find listening to podcasts helpful, as well deliberately leaving your earphones/headphones at home. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot imagine life without music. Did you know that there is music in the afterlife? That music is a connection with something close to creation? I understand that sometimes we can get an \u2018earworm\u2019 - a tune that goes around and around in our head. Mine is \u201cDoh, a deer, a female deer, Ray, a drop of golden sun.\u201d (You\u2019re welcome!). I find the best way to get rid of an ear worm is to listen to more music, not less!If you are talking about the crap we get shoved at us in shopping malls and on the radio, I suggest you actually explore music more, ask people about their favourite music and try listening to stuff that isn\u2019t on the radio. Music can be soulful and heart rending, it can be invigorating and exciting, it can be sexy and intimate. Just because you don\u2019t like some types of music does not mean there isn\u2019t a form of music that resonates with your very soul. ",
