            "answer_text": "Kudos to you for your decision. First of all don't get into any myth that a band should have so and so many no of members, they must have so and so instrument. Not at all. Its totally your choice which instrument you want to keep in a band or else. It depends on your genre too. Like in reggae you need a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist and a vocalist. In a rock band, a drummer, a lead and a rhythm guitarist, a bassist and a vocalist. But it's not necessary to stick to a structure. You can form a rock band with a drummer, keyboard and lead guitarist. The bottom line is that you should be entertaining enough, doesn't matter what instrument your band have or what genre you play. So please don't form prejudices about forming a band. Collect as many members as you can and see if it is working. To form a band\u2014 Collect members. You can search for them at social Stes like reverberation, Myspace, sound cloud etc. Or find nearby with the help of your friend circle.( Please keep in mind your goals while choosing members, better you all have same intents for the bands. Talk to each other whether you all want to take up the band upto their professional level or just joining for college days. )Start rehearsals. choose a suitable time for practice and no deviation from practice.

            "answer_text": "Well, first of all that you have come up with this idea of forming an all girl band that too in India. Well the best way is to have full faith on yourself. Don't even think what others will say (they will say because it's the duty of an Indian). Just head towards your goal ask for a few suggestions from your parents and try to give your best. Remember to consult your parents at each and every stage because they would never wish that something bad happens with you. This is the most important step towards your success. Well, all the best and I hope that I am able to get an autograph from all the members of your band. Once again, ALL THE BEST!!! ",
