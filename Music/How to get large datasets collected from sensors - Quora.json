            "answer_text": "I suggest you start at a page such as this List of citizen science projects or Where can I find large datasets open to the public, and look through them for open data sets around topics which require sensors, such as monitoring of air, water, or light pollution, or other ambient conditions.  (Of course, you'll be disregarding a tremendous amount of  wildlife counts, transit ridership, or crime rate reporting if they're not relevant to you.)  The governments of the world and citizen science projects produce large amounts of open data. I imagine some academic efforts also produce and publish open data, and the trend is growing.  If you have a particular topic or measurement in mind, search for \"open data\" or \"open dataset\" and the topic or measurement of interest.  If you're looking for sensor-generated data in particular, here are some topics you might explore, with a such a search: climate/weather, pollution, seismic activity, solar intensity, pollen count, traffic speeds, usage of electricity or water.
