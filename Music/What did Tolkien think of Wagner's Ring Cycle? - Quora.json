            "answer_text": " Deciding just what Tolkien thought of Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle and just what influence it may have had on his own work poses some thorny problems. First of all, it\u2019s kind of a \u201cloaded\u201d question in that Richard Wagner is the undoubted \u201cbad boy\u201d of the world of classical opera. A vicious anti-Semite and all around creepy character, Wagner was also the very favorite composer of German dictator, author of World War II, and the murderer of millions\u2014Adolf Hitler! What does it say of a composer, however talented, to have inspired a psychotic like this? So there are undoubtedly very good reasons why Professor Tolkien would have wanted to deny any connection with Wagner, however subtle or indirect. Tolkien always purported to hold Wagner\u2019s work in contempt, and once told his publisher, \u201cBoth rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\u201d But coincidences and connections, whether intentional or unconscious, tenaciously linger. Some similarities remain undeniable. Both Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings trilogy and Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle of four operas comprise heroic epics featuring a magical golden ring of immense and indescribable magical power, upon which the fate of an entire world hinges. Both star stalwart heroes and warrior maidens. Both have grasping dragons with fabulous treasure hoards and greedy dwarves obsessed with gold. Both feature mortal protagonists who must reforge the swords of their fathers in order to triumph. And in both of these works that aforementioned ring is virtually a discrete character\u2014an irresistible and corrupting force that shapes the destiny and twists the wills of the mighty. All a coincidence? I think not! Some critics have argued that Tolkien was directly influenced by Wagner, while others have diplomatically posited that his real influence were Wagner\u2019s own sources. These were the classic Volsunga saga and the Nibelungenlied. These epics concerned events in the 5th and 6th centuries and were written down in the Middle Ages. Tolkien was undeniably more than familiar with these Norse and Germanic source materials, going back to his undergraduate days. We know that he studied them extensively and even wrote about them. Other sources that Tolkien would also have had an intimate knowledge of were the Prose Edda, the Poetic Edda, and the Legend of Norna-Gest. In the end, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s credible that Wagner had absolutely no influence on Tolkien\u2019s creation. Some of the chapters of Unfinished Tales have a distinctly Germanic, if not an operatic feel to them. But it\u2019s fair to say that Tolkien\u2019s deepest inspiration most likely came from sources quite a bit older than Wagner.  ",
