            "answer_text": "Money and fame at a young age never makes anyone happy. People know everything about you even if you don\u2019t wish to tell them anything. You don\u2019t have a personal life. You start making distance from people, and trusting anyone becomes very difficult. JB got it all and that\u2019s why he was left alone. Nevertheless, he does a lot of great work and is seeming happy to me nowadays. Hailey Bieber, his wife, has really helped him to cope through depression but again internal struggles are very personal. so yeah, that\u2019s why JB feels lonely. god bless :) ",
