Even if you ask these questions, would they tell you? Besides no, what another answer could you get? Yes, I have a girlfriend but please don\u2019t mob her and send her death threats. ( I am only talking about a few Armys here, please don\u2019t get offended). It puts a strain on the conversation, thanks Ellen \u201cwHo do yoU waNt to coLlaB witH?\u2019I\u2019m pretty sure that BTS has gone through all the celebrities they can think of at this point. They might just hop on Famous Birthdays and start picking random people. repetitive, repetitive, repetitive questionsLooking at all those repetitives makes ME tired. So imagine BTS hearing the same 6 questions every time. The number of times I\u2019ve heard V say saxophonist- or some version of it lol.  the lack of genuine curiosityI love some interviewers but others sound like me trying to act like I\u2019m interested in the mites on people\u2019s eyelashes. Sorry, but that was the first thing I thought of. I tried okay. But BTS takes time out of their day to answer questions in an industry (pop) that almost treats them like their a joke. It\u2019s sad, and I tired of interviews treating them like this. I\u2019ll add so more but here\u2019s a happy BTS from a GOOD interview. whoops, can\u2019t really find one. well, cheers! ",

I remember one time when Ellen literally asked something so weird, that if they ever HOOKED UP yes that\u2019s right HOOKED UP with a fan, and the translator explained to them what \u201cHooking up\u201d means and so they all said no really quickly and they were really weirded out and Taehyung was like \u201cNot- no!\u201d and omg that was the best reaction but still I really think she was in the wrong for asking that, cause why on earth would someone do that? And a girl from another interview literally rejected Namjoon\u2019s handshake, WHO WOULD DO THAT???? i would do that if I was in her shoes! (She seemed a little cranky hahaha) ",
