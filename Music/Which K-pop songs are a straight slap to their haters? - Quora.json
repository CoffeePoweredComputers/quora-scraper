There are actually many songs but I will just say the songs I have been listening just now. \u201cRM and Warren G- P.D.D\u201d  You do need to give it a listen if you like \u201chonest rap\" \u201cIU: Bbibbi\u201d  Not just this song, IU actually has the guts to confront her haters. \u201cThe reason why I think IU is so great is because idols and artists can\u2019t help but care about what the public may think of them while fighting malicious commenters, but she doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d She doesn\u2019t offer any settlement, and I agree that\u2019s how it should always be done.\u201d \u2014 Kim Heechul I do know other songs too but they did appear quite shallow to me whereas these songs are BLUNT and straight up calling out with not much narcissism and flexing. I'll keep editing this answer as songs will come to my mind. ",
