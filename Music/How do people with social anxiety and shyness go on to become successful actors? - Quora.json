            "answer_text": "Do it scared. Your feelings do not have to match your actions. Though you may feel anxiety regarding a social or performing situation, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to avoid socializing or performing. If you want to be an actor, then you must act. And you must do other things that actors do. That may mean taking acting classes, interacting with other actors, or finding an agent. Being an actor requires you to perform and interact with many people. This can be difficult, especially for someone with social anxiety (as you know), yet it still has to be done. Thus, you have to decide if your dream of being an actor is more important than your discomfort in performing or social situations. If it is, then begin acting. Do all the things that actors need to do. Do it scared and eventually you may find that you\u2019re not so scared. Though it may take you a while to get to that point. In the mean time, do it scared. And whenever your anxiety gets so bad that you doubt whether you should do it or not, just remember how much you want to do it. And then do it. Another thing to remember: it probably won\u2019t be as stressful as you think it will be. The worst feeling will likely come prior to the experience, when you\u2019ve built up in your mind to be this big, important, and possibly horrible event. Once you\u2019re on that stage or in that social situation, you may find it\u2019s not as bad as you expected. Yet, there\u2019s only way to know for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "Acting is a way of getting in touch with other people through a structured and goal-focused ensemble. Great friendships can be made in the company of actors. You also need to invest time in learning about yourself and about the 'human condition'. In that respect it can be good for social anxiety.
