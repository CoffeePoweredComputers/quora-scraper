            "answer_text": "HATE is such a strong word. It's one of the worst things you can keep in your vortex. If you have decided to stop it then first step is done, let me help you with the second one. Identify your story and apply the solution. BETRAYAL is the story and Hatred is your vengeance.You loathe the person with all the energy you have. Every cell in your body screams hatred towards him/her. If you have this feeling for a person who betrayed you then the most common reason behind this is you blame yourself, that you were not good enough. In the back of your mind you keep on making stuff up, stuff that never even was the reason of betrayal. You get irritated and hatred towards them keep on increasing. FORGIVE. Yes, say it out loud! \u201cI forgive you\u201d, and with that you take the power back. They no longer have the power of making you feel bad about something that was not even your fault in the first place. Hatred is the mask and Envy is the flesh.Sometimes we observe someone and we develop some kind of negative feeling for them. Their way of flowing with the life is something we just can't resonate with. Deep down these people intrigue us, these people make us Envy them because either they are somewhat charismatic or they simply don't care about the norms of society. We look at them and deep down everytime we realise that we can't be like them or they can't be the part of our definition of NORMAL we start developing a negative notion towards them and name it hatred. Accept the fact that they are unique and you somewhat like them for their different ways of living, even if you can't apply them yourself. Accept the challenging views about the universe they throw at you. You don't necessarily have to agree just accept. Your acceptance is rubber and their traits are glue.For example you hate back bitching or negative people or the so called critiques which makes you hate the person acquiring the trait. I understand, I've been there! There is one thing that will go long way with you till you die. That's IGNORING, because you hating them is not gonna change them in any way, all it's going to do is make you angry at every sight of them. The art of ignoring should be mastered by everyone so that it can be utilised at the right places with the right people. Remember! You are not responsible for everything and everyone, so don't bother. According to my observations these are the three major reasons and the solutions. If you couldn't find yours, then remember\u2026 The reason will always lie within you, your heart doesn't deserve this kind of heavy negativity. Figure out your own solutions , your own ways , your own reasons and let it go\u2026not for them but for yourself because you deserve better. ",

            "answer_text": "i don\u2019t know what made you hate this person? it is very difficult to stop hating the person, but the best thing you can do is ignore it. and sometimes not ignore it. why ignore it? and why not ignore it? the person you may hate did awful things to you, but when you hate someone it consumes your inner mind. your mind will be filled with negative thoughts and you can\u2019t act positive. this hatred can change your views over other people too. for example, you hated a guy because he betrayed your trust and you still dwell with that hatred. later, you find some friends but something happened, like a misunderstanding and you will turn to hate them again, even when this could be solved easily. Hatred not only makes you hate, it will also create a barrier between you and other people. so whatever reason for you to hate this person, make sure you don\u2019t always be consumed by this hatred only. it is for your own benefit to ignore it. Try to avoid the person as much as you can, concentrate on things you like and can take of you, make your own goals and put your mind in achieving them. now I said why not ignore it? it is because for you the person you are hating maybe a bad person and has did something terrible. now what I meant to say is don\u2019t ignore the fact what things has led you to hate him. if this person is bothering you, instead of going against him with hatred alone, add courage, a tad cleverness and work hard and fight against him in a best way. because you can never win with hatred alone. here hatred will act as a spark to start your engine. so I said not to forget it but doesn\u2019t mean you have to dwell in it and turn a blind eye in every step. now finally can you stop hating the person you hate? look everyone is different, we all have own reasons and own morals to follow and you know about yourself than anyone can. analyze your self, how much this hate is bothering you and how it is affecting you. if it is going really bad for you and you realize hating the person is effecting your life try to ignore first. there are many therapies and tips out their on how to calm your mind. the best therapy is meditation. it is really effective and fills your soul with positiveness. if you are impatient and you don\u2019t have time for meditation, go do activities you like and that can ease your mind, make yourself as busy as you can. eventually you will forget this person you hated.

            "answer_text": "First of all, let me humbly say to you, I feel your pain in this. And I\u2019m sorry that you have to endure this situation in your Life. It must be a challenge for you some days. Let me say though, you are NOT alone in this. I too, struggle with it some days, which is why I can speak of it. After all, there are so many reasons to resent/hate others. I might point out though, that there are many more reasons to love them. But, that is for another time. So, let me share this insight with you\u2026. First of all, I should ask something: is it possible that that, it may not really be PEOPLE that you hate, but their behaviors/ actions that you find you detest? See, there\u2019s ALWAYS an underlying reason for that hate, so You might want to ask yourself at some point, \u201c Is it the person I hate, or is it their actions?\u201d This may go a long way to helping you become more aware of what you are feeling. Also, remember too that, we get angry over NOT HAVING CONTROL over something, so, you might wanna consider this angle too, when looking at why you hate people so. There might be a little bit of Frustration there. People are NOT their behaviors! Not all the time, anyways. Now, in the case of those who had had some real injustice done to them (i.e. bullying, sexual assault, etc.) their reasons for hate towards others is - in their minds - justified and VERY real. For the rest of us, the reasons are usually more minuscule. Example: we\u2019re pissed off because the traffic\u2019s snarled on our way to work in the morning. Or, the newspaper came late, AGAIN! And so on\u2026. Since we\u2019re going to be late for work - we think that, because of other commuters - we generalize that people are stupid and irresponsible, and fully to blame for all the crap WE have to go thru! Lol, does this sound familiar to you? If so, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s normal. The worst part of this hatred though, is when you turn that hatred on YOU. THEN, it becomes a REAL problem. So, be careful of that, cause it can lead to Depression\u2026 and you don\u2019t want that. In my own experience - and I hope you\u2019ll pardon me for my bluntness here - one way to overcome this hatred towards others, is a constant, and ongoing practice, of realizing that, people are WHO AND WHAT THEY ARE, and they\u2019re ALWAYS gonna do things that piss you off! So you\u2019d BETTER learn to deal with it. That\u2019s right! PEOPLE are always gonna be assholes. And you can\u2019t control that. That\u2019s one reason why I, myself, struggle with my OWN anger issues towards other people. Most times, I tend to think the Human Race is merely a bunch of retarded monkeys! Running around hooting and screaming while fling s**t at anything that\u2019s too hard for them to handle! ( And you wonder why Primates resemble US, so much!) By hating them, you give THEM power over you. And trust me, you\u2019re much better than that, even if you don\u2019t feel like it right now... you are. ACCEPTANCE is a big key here. Of yourself\u2026of others\u2026 of Life. You just have to get into the practice.. then maybe the habit,,, of telling yourself, \u201cF**k it! They\u2019re not worth wasting my anger on!\u201d Do this EVERY DAY, if you have to. Make this a GIFT to yourself . The way I approach this myself, is as if I am joking around with one of my best friends. And we\u2019re having a good laugh over it. But, you have to talk to YOURSELF as if you are that best friend. Remember, YOU are the one responsible for your feelings. How can you change them, when you are always handing the reigns to them over to someone ELSE? Finally\u2026Don\u2019t worry about forgiving others for past mistakes / reasons for you hating them. Instead, look at forgiving you, first. Realize the Human Race IS just a bunch of retarded Monkeys, MOST times (!!!!), and accept that that\u2019s okay! (Note: they have their good moments, too!) Once you accept it, and learn to see it as it really is\u2026 then you can start to move forward. Accept yourself\u2026 and as you do\u2026that hatred and anger will, gradually, shrink to the point where it no longer takes the attention that it once did. Because as it shrinks, YOU will grow. Weird, huh? Good luck with your situation. I truly hope what I have told you helps you. Thank you for reading it. ",

            "answer_text": "1) Understand that we are all born guiltless and that life then happens to us. Life is hard and it often twists people. If the person has done something unforgivable, try not take it personally - by that I mean that, it's them, not you.  2) Understand that nobody, except a very sick individual, gets out of bed in the morning and thinks now whose life can I cock up today? Everybody thinks they are doing what they have to do to survive.  3) Understand that letting go of your hatred helps you, not them. To say, I'm not going to be angry about this anymore is not the same as saying What you did to me was okay. It is more like saying, I'm not going to let you keep doing it to me.  One of my favourite sayings in times like this is: Hatred is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to die.  4) Symbolic visualisation of what you want your emotions to do helps enormously. The human brain thrives on visual plans and wants to do what you instruct it to do. It LOVES symbols - flags, dreams and music tell us that clearly.  You can imagine a balloon with the object of your hate inside and release that balloon to float away out of your sight. This symbolic imagination tells your brain that you don't want to think about that person anymore. It will work soon enough if you persist. You can imagine that hatred as a yukky poison that fills your body which you then let drain away out of you through your fingers and toes. This tells your brain that your resentment is toxic and it shouldn't allow poisonous crap to hang around in your mind because that also affects your body. If that person is still in your life and you are forced to unpleasant confrontations, you can imagine yourself as being surrounded by a shield which protects you from any 'bad vibes' that might come from them. This tells your brain to disregard input from that person. You may be thinking How can these things help me? It's all imagination. Well, great news - so are your emotions!  Yes, it's true -your emotions are all in your head. Which is not the same as saying they are not real, it just means that you are in charge of them. Yes, they are an unruly bunch and when they are running very high, it takes effort and clear thinking to keep them civilised, but still, they are yours to command.  Meditation is the greatest tool you can use to calm destructive emotion and there are many places on the net where you can learn to do it for free.  If you have been very wronged, it can take time to heal and release hatred - but while ever you are making the effort to release it rather than to hold on to it, you are ahead of the game. ",

            "answer_text": "Hate cannot exist without love. hate is strongest when it comes in the place where love once was. Knowing how to deal with hate is as simple as understanding this fact. It is exceedingly easy to hate someone, say, your ex\u2019s new girlfriend, or your best friend\u2019s boyfriend who is taking her away from you! But it is not always love lost that leads to hate. Years of piled up frustration and neglect too can make you start hating someone. So is jealousy. There are many who end up without knowing how to deal with hate in their hearts, for their siblings, for their former friends, spouses, or colleagues, because they were consumed by jealousy. Or because they feel what was rightfully theirs went to the other person. But, hate need not always be because of someone else. It is as much an indicator of your own personality, say psychologists. How to deal with hate The reasons for hating someone could be various. But that does not in any way change the fact that you have to deal with the people you hate nevertheless. And it is going to harm no one as much as it harms you. The most powerful argument against hatred is that it is pointless. So you hate that person in your best friend\u2019s life. It is not going to make your best friend dump her. All it will do is make things uncomfortable between your friend and you. And make you mad. That you hate someone or don\u2019t know how to deal with hate is your problem, not theirs. Sometimes, hate can also make you lose a lot. You hate half of your team at work. So you decide not to go to that team get-together and it so happens that, that annoying know-it-all in the next cubicle manages to become best pals with your boss over a few drinks, and sneaks away that coveted promotion right underneath your nose. Who\u2019s loss? Hatred for one person can also make you have to exclude, or avoid the people you love. Because you can\u2019t stand being around one person, you may have to stay away from those you love, because they don\u2019t feel the same way as you do. How hate can change your life You could be so busy hating people, that you fail to see love and concern coming from another direction. You may be too involved in managing all that anger and hate at your ex-boyfriend who dumped you for another girl, that you cannot see your friend, standing next to you all the while, waiting for you to get over the hurt and anger. You must understand that patience can run out eventually. Even the most loyal friends can give up and walk away, if they see that no matter how much they care for you and love you, you never notice.Learn to deal with people you hate. It can change the way you feel about yourself and the world. \u201cUnderstanding how to stop hating someone is simple if you can understand that you\u2019re causing more pain to yourself than the person you hate.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Life is 10% what happens to you and around you and it's 90% how you choose to percieve and respond to it. This may piss you off, but it's actually beautiful that we have so much control. A lot of people think that with all the chaos in the world that it's stressful and that we don't have much control over anything. We can have total control over how we view life if we want to. Isn't that amazing? Something traumatic could happen to you right now, and you could choose to make a morbid joke and actually start to have a good time despite everything. I used to hate everyone around me because I believe that self-improvement is community service. I believe that by bettering myself I can better care for and help others. And when I don't see others doing the same - when I see their lazy self- centered, hypocritical selves judging others for not being as good as them - I began to hate them. But through self-respect, I practice empathy. As I grow older I find that I can either accept that most people don't care as much as I do because they don't have enough perspective (which is what I have come to understand), or I could just be hateful all the time. Your degree of outward hate is in a direct correlation with your self-respect. The less you care about how you feel, the more you hate. The more you care about how you feel, the less you hate. Again, the beautiful thing is that you can control it all. ",

            "answer_text": "hmmm that\u2019s actually a good question. i\u2019m assuming this question is you acknowledging the problem and looking to fix it, but i think it\u2019d help even if you don\u2019t want to change. If you do want to change, good for you! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to and i wish you luck! Depending on how intense the hatred is and what kind of group you\u2019re talking about, the answer will be different. For example, if you hate a group of teenagers after they pushed you down and laughed at you, they aren\u2019t entitled to your forgiveness and you don\u2019t have to stop hating them. I\u2019d also say nothing is wrong if you\u2019re talking about hating nazis. But, if you hate someone or a group of someones over something they have no control over, then that\u2019s where it starts to get more serious because i\u2019d guess you mean you hate lgbt people, or black people, or homeless people, etc. In the case of more serious things like those, you should think about it deeply and interrogate your brain to see if you can find the cause. These are some questions i would recommend dwelling on (the example responses are if hypothetically i\u2019m you and the group i hate is gay people) Do i actually hate them?i\u2019m pretty sureWhy do i hate them?they make me uncomfortableIs the reason their fault?i guess not, but i\u2019d rather not see them do anything gay near me or my family. keep that stuff private.What can i do to lessen my hatred?talk to a professionalconfide in a close friend i trust to help me overcome iteducate myself on the group to see if my reasons make sensego to support groups for gay people to hear their stories and see with my own eyes what hate similar to my own has done to them (if i\u2019m allowed to attend, know i don\u2019t have malicious intent, and can 100% control myself if i get upset)If you want more detailed ways to overcome it, i\u2019m going to need to know more about the group you hate and why (if there\u2019s a reason). have a nice day :) it\u2019s possible that your hate isn\u2019t a huge issue if you don\u2019t let it alter your decisions, though. If you\u2019re aware that your hate can hurt people and know not to act on it, then keep your mouth shut and hands to yourself. You\u2019ll most likely be fine. However, it\u2019s not quite as useful because it\u2019s possible your feelings will grow more intense if you keep them bottled up. if you aren\u2019t willing to fully commit to no longer hating them, it\u2019ll probably work as a short term solution.

What they mean when they say don\u2019t spread it is that you can\u2019t go around raging all the time about whoever it is that is the object of your ire. Hate is a kind of obsession, and the only way to get rid of an obsession is to focus on literally anything and everyone else. Pretend that person doesn\u2019t even exist. Cut them out of your life, erase them entirely from your mind. It takes practice, but it\u2019s like getting rid of an earworm. Every time you catch yourself thinking of them, just change the dial. Have a list of things that are go-to topics you can immediately switch to, or activities you can immediately start doing, in order to get them out of your head. In the end, that person\u2019s existence doesn\u2019t really matter. If they\u2019re someone you can\u2019t physically escape, then you have a totally different issue, and the first thing to do is actually remove yourself from the situation that involves them. Is it a parent, and you live in their house? Find a way to move out, immediately. Same for a roommate. If it\u2019s a classmate, ignore them like they don\u2019t exist; you won\u2019t be in classes or school with them forever, and even though it feels like the time drags, it\u2019ll drag less if you find things to take joy in. \u201cTime flies when you\u2019re having fun\u201d is actually true. The problem with hate is that it\u2019s like drinking poison and expecting it to hurt the other person. You can\u2019t drink the poison. You have to let it go, however you can. I have had to let go of my hatred of so many people, and I know it\u2019s a long trek. There are people who deserve my disdain, but in the end, thinking about them just awards them brainspace they don\u2019t deserve. They aren\u2019t worthy of taking up my time, mental resources, or a place in my heart, even if it\u2019s a black place full of misery. They don\u2019t get to be a part of me. Maybe thinking of it like that will help. If you find you simply cannot stop, talking to a psychologist can help alleviate the stress. ",

First, close your eyes take a few deep breaths and silence your thoughts Secondly, start to recall the following events\u2014Recall your lowest most vunerable point in life. Recall how you felt when you thought it was over. Recall how cold and dim life was. Recall how much you cried that you literally didn\u2019t have anymore tears left. Recall how alone and tired you were. How badly you just wanted to rest. How badly you just wanted someone to love you and be by your side through your worst time. Recall how badly you just wanted mercy from life itself.  This might be hard, to recall a painful past and reopen old wounds, but it\u2019s supposed to be. Now that you have an intense visual picture in your mind of your worst point in life \u2192 picture the person you supposedly \u201chate\u201d going through exactly all that. Picture them at their worst, and their most vunerable self, perhaps them even crying. You\u2019ll soon realize that your heart is starting to feel mercy and love towards this person. Often times we think that it is just us in the world going through a worst time. But it\u2019s not. Everyone you see has had a \u201cworst time\u201d in their life, is currently going through one or will have one soon and will inevitably have another one later on in life. Let\u2019s pray for strength and good mental health for each other during those times. By doing this excersise you realize that you should just choose love not hate in this cold, cold world. Hating ruins the self more than anything or anyone else. It\u2019s not a pretty energy to carry around in life don\u2019t be a prisoner to hate. That saying \u2014 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even wish this on my worst enemy\u201d has mercy in it. Visually take your enemy to that point and you\u2019ll start feeling mercy towards them and when you can let mercy enter your heart for someone that\u2019s when how you feel about them begins to change.

            "answer_text": "An interesting question you have asked and one I wish more people cared enough to ask and take action to make the change this world needs now more than ever! There will always be someone that doesn't like another for many reasons such as what religion one follows, where they live, how they dress, or even the career you have. The list is infinite as why someone \u201chates\u201d on another. Speaking for myself and myself alone, skin color, how much money you make, where you live or whatever religion you put your faith into,etc., never has anything to do with anything. It's personality that makes or breaks how I perceive you. I don't care if you you're a hip hop artist or a garbage truck driver. You're attitude is what stands out. One of the things that I do that helps is that I think of myself in someone else's shoes. If you can see and understand the other person's perspective, you can usually find some common ground to build the bridge and eliminate the gap that helps create the hate. I also think that hating on someone is a waste of time and energy. I want to help be part of the solution rather than the problem. I know I can't change the past but I also know that I can't change the future. I can't help what my ancestors did centuries ago but if it helps, I am sorry. If I could change the past, I would without a second thought! We can not progress as the only race I see that we all are and that is the human race regardless of color, religion or any other excuse haters look for to spread their vitriol creating the problems we as the human race face everyday. We will never solve the hate problem by creating more problems. That's why I don't hate my worst enemy. I want people to know that they can rely on me as a human to help if they need or want it. You want to stop the hate, kill it with kindness I say. Hope this helps you overcome the adversity and help be part of the solution and not part of the problem we all face almost daily as the one and only,human race! Thank you for your question. Good day to you all! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not easy, I won\u2019t lie. I felt the same for many years. But there are a few things you can do: Find one thing you like about every person you hate. There\u2019s always at least one thing, always. It could be that they\u2019re confident, that they have cool hair, that they\u2019re creative, expressive, or kind. It could even just be that they\u2019ve never done anything bad towards you, or that they seem nice towards others.Question. One of the primary ways I learned to not hate people, was to question why I felt that way in the first place. I would question myself endlessly in my mind. \u201cWhy do I hate this person?\u201d and to the answer to that I would ask \u201cWhy does that bother me?\u201d and then \u201cWhat does that have to do with how I feel?\u201d and then \u201cWhy is this so important to me?\u201d and I would continue to ask why until I eventually found the answer \u201cI hate because of my own insecurities; this person does what I wish I could do, and so I see that my feelings are a sign for me to work on myself\u201d or something to that effect. Whatever the reason is, once you dig deep enough, you\u2019ll always find that there is no reason.Focus on yourself. Like I said, at least for me, my hate turned out to be my own insecurities projected onto others. So I looked inwards. I focused on things that made me happy. I took up crafts and reading fantasy novels and I became mindful of the beauty around me in the world and in people. I would strive to see this same beauty in myself. And I discovered that it was in fact there in abundance.Gratitude. Though I started my gratitude journal after I mostly got over this particular issue, I was still struggling with anxiety and bouts of depression. Now, they\u2019re almost entirely gone. Why? Because having a gratitude journal forces me to actively look for 3\u20135 things every day that I\u2019m grateful for, that made me happy, that were good. I write more about my experiences with gratitude here: How the Attitude of Gratitude Can Change Your LifeBe patient with yourself. This is very important for anyone to do really. So often in life we beat ourselves up, berate ourselves for small to big things, and we often label ourselves a failure if we don\u2019t live up to our own expectations as quickly as we\u2019d hoped. Patience is a virtue, and it\u2019s been a vital tool in my healing. Learning to \u2018stop hating people no matter what\u2019 is a journey. It won\u2019t happen overnight, it won\u2019t be easy, you will slip up, and you will uncover many aspects of your inner self that need healing. So be patient with yourself. Allow yourself to feel the way that you feel and recognise that all feelings have a purpose; they are there to teach you something about yourself so you can better yourself.These are just a few main points that will help you to not only stop hating people, but to begin loving yourself. And that\u2019s the crux of the issue to be honest; hate is just a lack of love and you can learn to love yourself truly and deeply. Good luck to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Hate is something NO ONE should ever feel. Hate eats at your soul. Hate and anger, which are intertwined, are emotions that drain you and stress out not just your mind, but your body as well, and leave you open, not just to pain, but physical illness - high blood pressure for one, and also lowering your immune system so that whatever viruses or germs are out there can gain a foothold in your body, and even promotes heart disease, organ diseases, or cancer, depending on whatever is weakest in your genetics and system at the moment. Whatever is weakest will give. Hate is complex, and involves more than anger though. Hate also involves the loss of objectivity and good judgment, frustration, feelings of helplessness, pain, regret, the desire to get even, and often feelings of loss, especially with regard to relationships. There are diffferent techniques to stop hate in its tracks. I am not a psychologst, nor have I had a problem with hate - my mixed feelings in negative situations have never progressed to the level of emotion hate entails, dislike or disdain has been my strongest emotion in any given situation, so I will tell you what I do in those situations, but suggest two things to you to do on your own. First, go online and research how professionals suggest that you approach this problem, or secondarily, if that is not sufficient to help you, see a professional. Seek therapy. Sometimes, talking it through and having an objective third party help you is the way to go. I myself, when get angry or frustrated, or feel any of the emotions I described above toward someone or a situation, find thinking the entire problem through to be helpful, especially though with a view toward thinking about the issue as if I was not the \u201cinjuried party\u201d but a spectator, as an objective observer. What would I say to a friend if they came to me and asked for my advice about it, and gave me all of the relevant details. I approach those kinds of circumstances with caring and acceptance and forgiveness in mind, for BOTH sides. Good luck, bubala! ",

            "answer_text": "I think hating is a basically anger toward specific people or thing, because that people or thing is not what you expected. So two ways to stop hating: know more about the people or thing that you hate, the second is a little hard: to believe in God. By knowing more about the people or the thing that you hate, you know what they actually are. We are not angry at a fish because the fish has no legs. If we were angry, we would be called silly or unreasonable. We may be angry at someone who made a mistake calculating 24+32. But many people just don't know how to do that. It is a fact, and we shouldn't be angry about facts. But it is hard because we are always angry at facts that is out of anyone's control. A child may be mad at his mom because his mom is poor, and cannot buy him a nice toy. A man may be mad at his wife because his wife lost her wallet.  A girl may hate another girl for the latter one is more beautiful. But it is not because the mom, wife, or the more beautiful girl did anything wrong. They cannot change themselves to make others not hating them. But if there is no God, all these seems worth hating. Why rich kids has so many and poor kids like me has nothing? Why rich young adults has beautiful and handsome girlfriends or boyfriends but I don't? I don't know how to explain to you that you should not be angry about these if you don't believe God. But if you happen to believe God. I think anger is basically dissatisfaction towards God. We are not satisfied of what is given to us from God. The reality is God has provided most of us basic needs. If you are in western countries. We should have much more than most other people. It's our sinful desires made us just want more and better. These sinful desires blinded us, that we cannot see there are many people has much less than us. They need our help. We need to put our focus on them not on the one who has more and better than us. This is how the glory of God can be displayed on his true believers. But if you don't believe God, there is one more way to stop hating, that is to kill your desires. Kind of Buddhist way of living. Extreme examples are monks who live in a Buddhist temple and eat vegetables, mediate and read Buddhist scriptures all day. Based on my observation, it doesn't work. But you can try. ",

            "answer_text": "Stop hating yourself, and develop some compassion for yourself. You don\u2019t have to be perfect, or best, or live up to someone else\u2019s ideal. It\u2019s very likely that what you dislike about other people, is what you also dislike in yourself. Psychologists have various terms to describe this, such as \u201cprojection\u201d (that\u2019s when you assume that someone else is thinking or feeling something, but really, you\u2019re the one who is thinking or feeling it). Another term, similar but slightly different, is \u201cidentification\u201d (that\u2019s when you feel you are the same as another person). People will project their negative thoughts and emotions onto other people, and they will identify with other people when they want to be, or think they are, like the other person. In any case, so you really hate EVERYONE? That\u2019s pretty extreme. Are you exaggerating, or is that really how you feel? Write down what it is about EVERYONE that you hate, or your reason for hating them, then set it aside for a day or two. After you\u2019ve let it sit for a few days, take another look at it, and see if your reasons are still the same. Then ask yourself if you yourself have any of those traits that you put on your list. Hating someone comes from either anger or fear - you\u2019ve either been hurt, or you think you\u2019ve been hurt, or you are afraid you\u2019re about to be hurt. Is one of those thoughts true? If so, who did it or is about to do it to you? Did EVERYONE do it? Was it on purpose, or was it a misunderstanding? To get past hating everyone, you have to find a way to accept that people aren\u2019t perfect, everybody is doing the best they can, yourself included, and we all make mistakes. Usually those mistakes are fixable and forgiveable. But you have to accept that those same realities apply to you too. When you start accepting your own mistakes, and you realize it\u2019s human and you don\u2019t make mistakes on purpose, you\u2019ll start finding it easier to forgive other people for their mistakes.

            "answer_text": "Try to understand them. Try to understand why they believe the things they do and where it all comes from. This will not eliminate all hate. I\u2019m not personally one that believes hating things is fundamentally bad anyway. However, it will definitely help regulate it. Everyone has a reason, usually an understandable one, for why they are the way they are. Why they do what they do. An abusive person is clearly not to be liked. Yet, many abusive people abuse others because they themselves were abused. A thief might be someone that doesn\u2019t care at all for those they rob, but sometimes they\u2019re in need of money or food and hate what they do. Sometimes they\u2019re desperate. A non-critical thinker can be annoying, and thus thats most of the world, but we don\u2019t really teach people to think critically. So who\u2019s at fault? The one that was never nourished or a system of thought that thinks its unnecessary or not important enough to implement? Or the system just wants people to be dumb, thats always possible. Point is, the average person isn\u2019t looking for trouble and looking to be a problem. They\u2019re just trying to live to the next day and enjoy life in the best way they know how without doing any serious damage to others, unlike what a lot of media might have you believe. But even so, many that do dumb things and intentionally hurt others weren\u2019t born that way. Some might be, the jury\u2019s still out on that theory, but most are not. Point is, it all comes back to something. There\u2019s always a reason, a construct, a logic, for what leads people to be the way they are. This doesn\u2019t make what they do right. It makes it more understandable. Its easy to hate fully when one feels there\u2019s no other solution. But when you might start seeing where things come from and how they work, you\u2019ll find yourself hating problems more and not the people that have them. Problems can be solved and people can solve them. People are living yinyangs, neither fully evil or fully good. Neither fully the solution nor fully the disastrous end. When you see that people have problems and aren\u2019t the problems themselves and see hope for them, you\u2019ll hate them less even if you find them to be disagreeable, annoying, and even in some cases intolerable.

If everyone hand the same temperament, the world would be a very boring place. I personally think when a person hates someone he is not hating the other person, but dislikes something in the behaviour of the other person which irritates him/her. This irritant might just be a projection of his own negativeness on another person when in actual fact the other person is ok, and it is the observer who needs to work on his personality . This negativeness in you makes you a hater and you are always being advised to stop being so hateful. If your near and dear ones and friends are telling you all this then it is high time that you started working on getting rid of your negative feelings for others and developing a positive outlook in life for all. Start by focusing on all of the good things that are happening in your life and appreciate what all the people do for you. Some points to consider See the best in others instead of the worst.One of the reasons you are hating others is because you may have the apprehension that everyone you know is just waiting to hurt you, annoy you, irritate you . You need to stop looking at the people around you as irritants or a threat and learn to value the good people around you and to see that they can actually improve your life if you let them. If you give individual people a chance, you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re not so bad, after all. Everyone who talks to you has the best intentions, not the worst. If a co worker or neighbour wants to talk to you or asks you to have a cup of coffee does not mean that he has a hidden agenda for being out with you, it just means he wants to be your friend, 2. Learn to enjoy talking with people. You may be hate people because you feel that they get stuck onto you when in fact you want to be alone. It is not always so, one does want time for oneself but not all the time. Learn to enjoy having a conversation with others/ connecting with others instead of looking at everyone who talks to you as someone who is a waster of your time. Smile more, it does not cost you anything. In fact it takes less muscles to smile than to frown. It keeps those wrinkles away too. A smile will put you in a good mood and will make someone\u2019s day happy too. It will shows that you are friendly and you\u2019re open to conversation and people will be more likely to trust you.Find common ground with people/ similar topics of conversation for small talks. This will lead you to build deeper relationships and to get to know people better. 3 3. Giving compliments. A hater is most unlikely to give compliments . But you should practice giving sincere compliments, thus indicating that you are a caring person not a fault finder or an irritant . Try giving one or two compliments in a day to anyone say an acquaintance or a stranger like you are looking very good today. Perhaps that compliment you give to a person can make that person\u2019s day. Maybe it\u2019ll be the only positive interaction that person has all day, and it takes so little effort. In this way you will develop a positive outlook in life especially towards people and now you will look for the good in people rather than the bad. If you know a person more closely, then focus on complimenting an aspect of that person\u2019s personality instead of just the superficial things. If you compliment more people, you\u2019ll hear more positive returns. All that positive energy around you will will not let negativeness survive.4 4. Open up to people. If you open up to the people around you, you will find understanding, compassion, and friendship. Such positive vibes around you will make you less likely to hate people and more likely to see that developing relationships with people out in the world is a good thing. You don\u2019t need to bare your soul to the first person you see. However, slowly opening up to your acquaintances will build relationships which in turn will lead to friendships. You will find that some people were like you but changed and connected to others. 5. Think of the ways people can help you. Thinking of others as helpers/ guides in your endeavours can also make you stop hating others. Your family and friends can help you in the areas where you are not so strong, like filling up forms for job interviews, cook something, outdoor games etc. Talking to people more will make you see how much they have to offer to you. You may not know, for example, that your neighbor is a computer expert until you talk to him more. If people help you with something, help them in return. This will make you more connected to people and less likely to hate them.6 6. Volunteering help. A hater never volunteers to help anyone. He prefers to be aloof/ self centered. But if start caring about people other than yourself and start helping around, you and the people around you will grow towards kindness, compassion for all living things. Being a volunteer for a few times a month will help you feel more open-minded and it is most likely that you will meet people who will help you develop a more positive outlook in life and see goodness instead of all bad things. A positive atmosphere brings about bonding within the community. Whether you\u2019re teaching kids or elder, you will feel more connected. ",

            "answer_text": "You are on the way by asking the question. If I were to hate you, you would not even know about it. I, however, would be the one consumed by hate. So it is important to regard hate as something within the hater, and almost irrelevant to the hated. I presume the hated has done or perhaps been something that upsets you. First, look into why you were upset by whatever it was. How did you let it have such an impact on you? Even if the hated\u2019s actions did cause you serious problems, and even if they intended it maliciously, you need to regard the problem as an issue to be dealt with. You will achieve nothing by hating the author. Even if your logical way to deal with the hated is to disable their ability to impact you negatively, think of it as a solution to a problem, not revenge. Thinking of it as revenge places too much status on them. It is just a problem to be dealt with. If often think this problem has its origins in the bizarre unpopularity of thinking of yourself. That is often seen as selfishness, and so people tend to think more of problems as independent things, not barriers to you getting your way. So what you need to do is fix you vision on the direction you want to take, and go that way. One by one you deal with the obstacles, whether they be things or people or whatever. And when they have all been dealt with, suddenly you are where you wanted to be. Hate can prevent you from getting there, if you dwell on it. ",

            "answer_text": "Always try to put yourself in their shoes. Try to see the world from their eyes. Example. Black people might happily want to hate white people because of slavery and the fact that up to a certain time, all the black people in America were forced there aboard slave ships in chains by white people. Now placing myself (I\u2019m black) in the shoes of white people, if I was born into a society with relative technology, telescopes, paper, books, WHEEL, ships and the general trend was for people around me to want to travel to distant lands out of curiosity and because they had the means to do so, and I had done so and discovered America, one huge empty land, would I have resisted the idea of paying for, supporting, or travelling to Africa to drag black people across to work on the land for me as slaves, especially as the books and scientists of \u201cmy time\u201d would have told me not to bother about these black people since they aren\u2019t human \u201canyway\u201d? Well a very difficult and personal question to answer especially as my neighbours and many people I know would likely be doing such in all ignorance. Sometimes we can be extremely wrong and we need divine guidance to sort us out. But for people who run away from religion, from God, I wonder how you will have any basis to validate any divine guidance. In the 1940\u2019s my Dad was in primary school (here, British Colonised Nigeria, Africa) and was clearly taught in science that the sun went around the earth. Before the end of the decade, science taught them that it was the other way around. The earth goes around the sun. That\u2019s science as a guide for you. :-) When you realise that you too are not all that correct in all your views, you might learn to take it easy on others and learn to love them since they could easily be you.

            "answer_text": "First of all, stop thinking about the person. But, if you can't help it then concentrate on them. Try to figure out why exactly do you hate them. Is it something they said or did which didn't go well with you. Or, you simply don't like them for what they are. You need to know why you hate them so much. Without knowing the root cause of any given problem you can't solve it let alone overcome it. Hating others is like a problem. It is not good for you. If you are hating someone you are harming yourself. The person being hated may not even know that you are hating them. They are fine with it. They are not on the receiving end. You are. You are the one who is taking the whole impact of the negativity created by this hatered of yours. This negativity is going no where. It is created in your heart and it is impacting you only. It is increasing on a daily basis. More so, when something happens in this direction like a quarrel, a physical fight with the person or some kind of cold war like glaring, encountering and disliking anything related to that person whom you are hating. You need to understand that we have been created in such a way that things like hate will harm us physically, mentally, and emotionally. Our brain and heart can not take these things lightly and without a damage to self. They will take it to heart (pun unintended) and it will not have a good and positive impact on them. So, keep yourself away from such things. In the long run they can literally destroy your physical and mental health and you may fall sick just for hating others. ",

            "answer_text": "I try to put myself in their shoes. Empathy can go along way, but only so far. If that doesn't work, I ask myself if I might be projecting. I do sometimes take a dislike to someone who has similar faults to my own. When this is the reason, it takes me a shameful amount of time to admit it, but I do get there in the end. If neither of these choices are relevant or helpful, I consider that the person might be very different from me. I have had to do this with someone who is firends with a close friend. I really don't like him because we have nothing in common. He is super insecure and not content with the idea that someone mightn't be the same as him. I\u2019m giving him some space and it's not working. The more I pull away, the more he wants to chat about football, which I hate. He hates martial arts (boxing is better, apparently) and has no idea who any of my favourite bands are. Small talk is excruciating. I am now in the position now where I have to either find something to like about him or give him some honesty. I want to be tactful. I'm thinking of this, \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird that we don't like any of the same things yet we always end up chatting? Let's run down a list of all the things we like but haven't mentioned and hopefully we'll find something in common. Otherwise we'll end up getting uncomfortable every time we see eachother.\u201d OK, so it's a work in progress. My point is that you can try to find something you do like about the person, failing that try to address the issue as a problem you share with them (I.e. You have nothing but this problem in common) or just avoid them. I wish you luck. I'm pretty sure I'll need some luck myself. ",

Think about it for a while and come up with all the reasons, why you really shouldn\u2019t waste a second, because there are only negative outcomes for yourself if you hate. Once you thought about it hard and thorough for once make the conscious decisions to not feed this fire anymore. Stay away from this person, don\u2019t talk about this person, ignore this person completely, stay away from everyone who keeps mentioning that person.Distract yourself with positive people or tasks or anything you can come up with every time you have a thought involving that person you hate. Ask friends to help you to distract you. Try to avoid time on your ow in the beginning to take away time to think. It is going to get a little easier over time, but the first couple of weeks it is good to just completely distract yourself. Any form of energy, any thought, you put on this feeling is like another piece of wood on the fire. The longer you manage to avoid putting a piece of wood on, the sooner it burns down. At the beginning it is like a log, the more time passes it is more like a kindling wood and won\u2019t burn as long. So the first days and weeks are most important. I hope this helps you \u2026 ",

Just go back and think about the situations where you have hated someone but now it doesn't matter what you feel for them now. My hate is going for more than 2 yrs, I don't know about yours. And still only I know how I am going through my life. I cannot share that with anyone. It is my secret. But I know I am strong even though it feels sometimes that I cannot go on. And trust me don't try to stop hating someone, just try to ignore that feeling, punch bags to take out your hatred. Love the people who love you. Cry if that helps you. But I will suggest you punching bags or do some exhausting exercises, run , fall ,swim etc. Use your energy for something else. Don't judge anyone just love them. It helps.

You\u2019ve trained your brain to focus on the negatives. It won\u2019t be an overnight switch but with practice you can change. You have two good qualities I admire: honesty and, based on your question alone, a willingness to recognize and do something about your own flaws. If you\u2019re looking for something to like about yourself you could start there. You may also want to get some professional help. Self loathing and self hatred can be symptoms of depression. If medication and therapy can help you feel better about yourself and others the problem is more likely to be medical than reality. You\u2019ll also find some wonderful people who are willing to help others which might help change the way you see humans. You could also try to find a cause you believe in and do some volunteer work. Make a contribution to something you can be proud of. This will also put you in touch with people doing just that and may sway your opinion of others. Lastly, is managing you expectations and realizing that your opinion of yourself and humanity is not a complete picture. Feelings aren\u2019t facts. Opinions aren\u2019t reality. Perfect is not possible. This is probably the most important piece for you. Your question is a cry for help so you can feel better about life. Asking for help doesn\u2019t seem to come easy for you but I see it. I hope you make the next bold move to feel better and get the help you deserve, even if you don\u2019t feel like you do. You are worthy and things will get better. ",

These are all human things. Stop thinking us and them, start thinking \u201cus\u201d. Every single person on the planet suffers. Even Jesus suffered. Some people are blind, some are deaf, some are crippled, some are deformed. Some are orphans, some are ill. Some have cruel parents. Some have been abandoned by parents. Some have been raped and tortured by parents. Stop comparing and competing. Focus on your journey and how you can make life easier for people around you. Your friends, your family, but also strangers. There is not one person on this planet who has an easy ride. I knew a white male who landed a cushy job at 21, so was comfortable financially when his peers were struggling. But he was cursed with bad looks, so while he had a great job, he struggled to find love. Look at Oprah who had a tough upbringing and is a successful tv host. She went through a lot of pain early and still struggles with weight and relationships. Look at Robin Williams who while he was a successful comedian and actor, took his own life because he felt so hopeless. No one has it easy. But in life you just do your best. ",

Emotionally you are re-experiencing it like you did before, so have the same out-come. You are betrayed in some way and because of the degree of anger, Hate. Sociologist have a process call stamp collecting. TA (Transactional Analysis) called them trading stamps. http://www.scribd.com/doc/33646788/Transactional-Analysis  There used to be a premium kind of thing called S&H green stamps and the competitor, Gold Strike stamps. They were given for every 10 cents you paid in grocery stores and gas stations. When you filled up a book, you could go to a \"Redemption\" store and redeem your collection for merchandise. They were similar to a Service Merchandise store, only instead of cash, you took your stamp books. Big ticket items, like a Coleman stove, required more books as did a lot of jewelry. TA therapist see people collecting archaic feelings on a number of other factors.They found people kept stamps on friends, religions, certain cultures, race, family members, political parties, spouses, and society in general.   Depression stamps are for those who market themselves as a victim.White stamps (purity stamps) are from those who get to be blameless and self-righteous.Gold stamps are from self appreciation. These can be ego stamps too but are tracking what you deserve.Counterfeit stamps are where you are so sensitive to an issue, you chalk one up when you are imagining being offended.Brown (S**t) stamps are for those injustices where we were wronged.You can tell when people are going to cash in because they say things like, \"Thats the last straw\" that's the last stamp. People can tell you about all the stamps if you ask them. They earned every one.   These stamps can be cashed in for \"guilt free\" prizes. In the case of gold stamps, it might be a trip or a new car for working so hard.   In the case of brown stamps, It might be a guilt free temper outburst, a drinking binge, flunk a test, or buy something.   As the stamp books pile up, you get bigger prizes. One, guilt free break something; one, call the other a nasty name; or one, be cold and act like you don't care; or even one, hit them.   If this isn't halted and turned around, then hard line players can cash the collection in on one giant guilt-free, mental breakdown, imprisonment, divorce, murder or even, suicide.  This process is in a book called \"Born to win.http://books.google.com/books?id=7vfoJF0c3GUC&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=%22Transactional+Analysis++%22stamp+collecting%22+-hobby++-hobbies&source=bl&ots=Iv5w36WVGw&sig=UdN6MstqE5KvkWebhyO3tuKCbNs&hl=en&ei=0FCJTeCqIoSQ0QGOpfT2DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&sqi=2&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22Transactional%20Analysis%20%20%22stamp%20collecting%22%20-hobby%20%20-hobbies&f=false You have to find a way to reduce this stock pile of injustice that is working you over and pull the energy out of it.  We had a guy in town years ago, who literally dragged two rifles by their barrels on the carpet to the elevator of a high rise hotel. He went to one of the top floors, broke out a window and started shooting people. He killed a few and wounded a number of others. The police broke into the room and captured him. My old partner did the psych work-up on him. His girlfriend leaving him was the last straw. Society had bullied and made fun of him  for years growing up and when she left, it allowed for a guilt-free, cash in the stamps, kill people, and have no feelings. Hate collects till it corrupts the holder of it. You have to find a way to reduce it some how. One of the ways is from the NLP people: Close your eyes and imagine all the items you hate about them and place them all linked together on a movie reel.Visualize a movie theater and go inside, then up to the projection booth with your film canister tucked under your arm.Open the canister and put your film on the projector, run it to the first frame and freeze it.Look out into the theater, make sure the freezed framed picture is in black and white. Turn it that way if it isn't.Now go down to the lobby then into the theater.Go sit down in the front row, center seat and see yourself up on the screen in black and white, freeze framed.Allow your consciousness to pop up out of your head so you are looking down at yourself sitting in the chair.Now allow your consciousness to float to the back of the theater and into that cubby hole window so you are back in the projection booth.Look out in the theater and see you body looking at the frozen film of you in black and white.Now put a safety shield of plexiglass in front of the window to protect you from any feeling shown on the screen.That is a high speed projector, Run the film from the first incident, to the last, in no more than 10 or 15 seconds and freeze frame it at the end.Turn the projector knob to color, so you can see the film in color on the screen.Remove the plexiglass shield and allow your consciousness to float back through the window into the theater.Float past your body and into the self on the movie screen. You are frozen in color in the last frame of the movie.Now let the movie, with you in it, run backwards high speed. Again, no more than 10 or 15 seconds. You are going to walk backwards, talk backwards, everything will be experienced in reverse, back to the beginning.Open your eyes.Now test buy thinking of one of those events. If you were successful in your re-frame, there should be a flattening of affect and hence, no feelings of anger for the issues on the film.This is a basic, but simplified format of NLP developed by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, to refile a reference feeling. There are tweaks I have to do to personalize this usually. It is not the only way to change anger, but is is fairly effective for people who are able to use their imagination. ",

            "answer_text": "I think I will start by saying this:Do you have a purpose in hating this person? Also, do you lose anything by hating him/her? And then in turn, I will also ask \u2013 do you have a purpose in NOT hating this person? Meaning, do you gain anything by stop hating them? By hating this particular someone, I\u2019m not sure what you will gain, but I am quite certain you lose bit and bit of yourself every day. Overtime, you might forget what kindness looks like, what love feels like, what it\u2019s like to freely feel what you want. In the end, you are blinded by this one person and all you could feel is this intense negative emotion; he or she is the one to \u201coccupies\u201d your mind. You might even risk having your hatred for him or her guide your views of the world down a very wrong path. That, is the one thing you don\u2019t want to happen. By not or stop hating the person, I can\u2019t tell you with certainty what you will gain, but at the very least, I can reassure you won\u2019t lose anything. The only thing you will lose - is the person him or herself and the place they hold within your heart and your mind. By letting go of this emotion, this person simply doesn\u2019t weigh on you or your emotions any longer. Maybe you will still be bothered by his/her presence, but your mind is no longer \u201cchained\u201d to this being. I think hate has as much of a weight as love does. A lot of time, it just seems impossible to simply and rationally tell ourselves not having certain emotions. But unlike love where we will almost always and effortlessly see the beauty/positive side of the person we are in love with, with hate \u2013 we actually and unconsciously look for the things to hate in this being. You might thing \u201cwell everything about this person is despicable\u201d but that\u2019s only because you are constantly and unconsciously reminded of all the possibly wrong things with him/her. Both emotions are inevitable, but hate is more or less, avoidable. As for \u201chow\u201d to avoid it \u2013 back to the first question I asked, do you have a purpose of hating or not hating this person? Do you lose or win anything by having either emotion? If you got that out, I\u2019m sure you will figure out the right way, the way that fits you, to let go of this negative feeling. I will, however, say that after such a long time of having that emotion builds up, it might feel weird to just let it go. It\u2019s weird in a sense that it makes we feel incomplete, like we are lacking something. Regarding this, I think other answers have pointed out excellently that it\u2019s time to replace the negative emotion with positive ones. You know - placing your feelings and attention on where and who you want :) ",

You do not have any more energy to hate. Hence, my suggestion is hate fully. Once, all your interest, energy, motivation are no more, you become empty. Look at yourself. Your mind is free. A feeling of love will arise within you. You will feel different, energetic. You start liking all around you. You feel yourself in love. Whatever you do, love is certainly be associated with. A new loving feeling you will experience. After night, morning arises. Summer will follow winter. Happiness will lead to unhappiness. Nothing is steady in this world.

My boss is doing one online course. I usually prepare assignment for him for the course. During 3rd assignment, in one paragraph, I mentioned one word \"I hate the person who designed it\". Before sending he use to read and then we both will send from his  mail to his mentor. After seeing that word, he said \"Don't hurt anyone and told to change the word\". You know, the interesting fact is the design has been made 5 decades ago and we both even unaware that, who made it. But he is saying don't hurt anyone. He didn't even who the person, but he saying don't hurt. But, you asking the person who you know.  I'm saying one even we don't like that doesn't mean we have to start hating them. Just move away from them. In case, they keep on coming to you, explain your problem to them and say we have to be apart from sometime. After that, it will become routine so both stop approaching each other or facing each other.  I don't like so many, but that doesn't mean I hate them. So, I casually behave with them like just Hi/BYE and move aside. A person who is bad to you, will be seen as good by some other. All are good/bad in one or another way to each.  Hating is easiest things, we are following. Loving/caring is difficult thing, we are trying to get it. So, try to focus on difficult thing, which we don't have. I'm trying. you? ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tough, but very genuine question. I have a belief and technique that I hope helps. Inside people are two very important, but ever conflicting processes. Our emotions and logic. We feel our emotions passionately. We think with logic and see straight. Sometimes one will override the other. This can create a situation where we are unable to understand why we feel and think so differently. In your case, you find it difficult to stop hating when you feel you really should. When we hate someone, I believe it means we are in pain and that someone is, in our mind, linked to that pain. Our minds tell us that hating is harmful and we do our best to stop. Then that emotion, still raw from pain, jumps in and the hating is renewed. It can be very frustrating and confusing for many people. In my experience, strong emotions, like hate, can be healed through self determination. Not by force, but through support. When you feel the hate growing or returning, mentally acknowledge the hate feeling in your mind, that it came from pain, and that you want it to fade away. Try to be encouraging and not forceful. Being forceful within the mind can create barriers and walls. After you acknowledge the pain and encourage the hate to leave, use logic to explain why you should not hate that person. Tell yourself you want to be free of the negative feelings that hate brings. Remind yourself of things that help you to understand where the hate came from. Perhaps most important, remember that when the hate is gone you will be a happier person. For example, if you hate someone that hurt your feelings in the past, you can explain to yourself that there may be reason you do not know or understand that may be involved. There may or may not be a good reason for what they did, but it is over and you want to be at peace in your mind with what happened. Remember, you are not excusing their behavior. Not even a little. Just allowing yourself to move on and be happier in your life. Depending on the pain level you have, your hate may take a while to subside. Some things I can get past in a day or week. Somethings took me months or more. But you are right, getting past the hate is the best thing for you. Hating someone is certainly not hurting them or helping anyone in any way, but moving on can be so very rewarding. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Hatred is a state of mind, wherein you feel all the negative emotions stacked against your object of hatred. Here is one of the ways to reduce it. Before practicing it, severe all ties with your person of hatred. Avoid places where he or she regularly goes. You want to give yourself time away. Avoid even getting any information about them in your feed. Day 1: Write down all the hard emotions you haven in a diary. You can even select an online diary. Actually, online diary is safer. It will not get into bad hands. Write it down, write down even the most destructive, even criminal things you want to do to them. While writing, imagine doing all the things you are writing. Done? Cool, the worst level of hatred is over. Yes, you may not feel it, but the process has already begun. Day 2 and 3: Take time out. Do some activities which you like. Day 4: Repeat the same things as day 1. Don\u2019t go through what you wrote on day 1. Don\u2019t delete it either. Day 5 till Day 30: The next few days or weeks, whenever you feel the urge and feel strongly about your hatred, keep writing them in the diary, alternating with activities like fitness, drawing and sketching, playing musical instruments, etc. Day 31: On this day, effects of the above therapy would already be visible to you. You would actually start feeling less intense emotions as you would inflict lesser and lesser damage to your object of hatred in your subsequent writings. Day 32 and beyond: Keep practicing days 1 to 30. You would slowly feel that the urge to write and the intensity of the emotions involved both have started to decrease. Keep persisting with the process until it completely goes away. You may ask why does the process span so long? Its simple, hatred was not developed in a single day. You can dislike a person a single day, but hatred is something different all together. It was built due to constantly living in proximity with the person and constantly disliking whatever impact he made to your life. It also is because, you chose to suppress your feelings or even if you expressed, you were not understood. Unfortunately, the period of letting the hatred out, I have found is significantly longer than the actual period of hatred built up. Good luck! Lose your hatred, things would be more peaceful within you without it. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not an easy question. If this person has done something for which you can seek redress (for instance, a legal matter), you may find that once you obtain \u2018justice\u2019 (whatever that looks like) you may feel better and ready to move on. However, sometimes we hate someone because they have hurt us in some way. It\u2019s good to talk this through with a trusted friend or counsellor, and have the chance to express your grief and anger. But it is unwise to remain in that spot! A wise person once told me that when we spend our time hating someone so intensely, what we are actually doing is giving them space in our life - the very thing we don\u2019t want! It also crowds out things we DO want in our own lives - people, events, activities, we use the energy we would give to being a happy person with a full life to thinking negatively about people we don\u2019t like!!! So, think about something else. Not just casually, you have to WORK at it. Every time this person comes into your mind, think of something else. Have a list of things ready to think of, and stick to it. Do things that you have to focus on that have nothing to do with this person, and keep doing things that stop you thinking about this person. Get truly involved with and spend time doing one or more things - work, social life, hobby, that has/have nothing to do with this person. In other words, start living in the world as if they don\u2019t exist. If you see them, nod and walk past - don\u2019t engage with them at all, even casually. In time, you will stop feeling the intensity of emotion you do now, and after that you will soon forget to feel hatred, and eventually you won\u2019t think about them at all - you will spend your time living your own life and not giving space in it to someone you don\u2019t want there! Good luck :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Earlier, I used to hate this classmate of mine. I don't know why, but I reasoned myself that she isn't a good person, she isn't friendly with me, she doesn't talk to me, she ignored me...she is bad. So, I hated her. Later one day, she approached me and talked to me. I no longer had the reason to say she didn't talk to me because she just did. She smiled at me often and offered polite conversations always. She was friendly. I no longer had even that reason to hate her.  She invited me for hanging out, and involved me in her activities. She didn't ignore me. I no longer had that reason to hate her.  I still hated her. Remember, she wasn't a good person..she was bad. So, I had all the right to hate her. That is what I told myself.Then one day, I was helpless and broke, and it was she who gave me a hand and supported me. She was my Samaritan. I realized she was good... I racked my mind wondering why I hated her and couldn't come up with any reason. My all reasons for hating her proved wrong. I was wrong. I judged her wrong, and it took me knowing her to realize I never hated her.I thought I hated her. I never did.Just like that, my hate vanished.----------- Similarly, you think you hate everybody and you have built a wall of reasons to justify why you hate them.  Simple, remove those reasons. Don't hold prejudices. It isn't necessary that people act and behave the way you want, but that doesn't render them victim of your hate.  When you can get rid of your judgmental behavior of yours, you will no longer hate people. And, every time you feel you are falling back to hating people, remember this and it will get you back on track:   Not everyone is out there to get you.  Good luck with loving people :) ",

But it was quickly washed away with Love. Then I hated them again, then again loved them. One day I said to myself: \u201cAnushka you can either hate this person or love them. What feels better to your heart and body?\u201d As I began to make never-ending lists of positive aspects about this person, I decided I was going to Love them. It was the only way to go. Of course this can be difficult to consistently do when there\u2019s a messy history, when there\u2019s a barrage of noisy, scary memories, a feeling of abandonment. So every time his name popped up on my phone, this decision to love him was replaced with fear. So I changed his contact name:  We don\u2019t talk much. We\u2019ve both found ways to keep ourselves at peace. But now, whenever a notification from him flashes on my screen, I am reminded of my decision. Every time he messages or calls me, I bless him. I flow all this energy of Affection to him, and he doesn\u2019t even know it. Lucky me for having someone to Love from behind the curtains. ",

            "answer_text": "Any kind of feeling like Love, Hatred, Affection, Liking, Care, Jealousy, etc, etc arises only when we think about someone very deeply. The more you think, the more that feeling occupies your mind . Therefore, train your mind to focus on feelings that are good, positive and healthy for yourself. Here are a few simple things you can follow to stop hating someone- Forgive : Our brain remembers the smallest of the pain that someone knowingly or unknowingly caused us. So, the best way is learn to forgive people. Soon as you do this, brain will start treating that person normally and your Hatred towards him will gradually decrease. Stop Overthinking : Ask questions to yourself whether your hatred towards the other person is justified? Sometimes we become too emotional to understand the situation and act childish. Do some logical analysis and act accordingly. Discuss : This is one of the best practices. Sometimes you assume things about someone and start hating them for no reason. Just go and talk to them and try to figure out what is the root cause of problems between you two.Let the conversation begin..!! Be positive: There will always be poeple who will try to bring you down and criticize in everything you do, just ignore them, since you have to achieve greater things in your life.

His father had terrible rage and his brother actually murdered his brother-in-law and is now serving a life sentence in jail for his crime of passion. My ex nearly killed my son with his rage. Anger is dangerous. It causes cardiovascular issues and usually an early death. My ex died at 52. Hate hurts the one who carried it. I was molested by four different men and abused by a narcissistic mother. I let go and forgave everyone. Why? Because I was dying. I had Fibromyalgia, Epstein-Barr, bladder infections, and sinus infections. I recognized my thoughts were literally killing me. We have to forgive and let go. Forgiveness does not excuse the behavior, it is for you. Forgive yourself for being hurt and angry. Then forgive the one who hurt you. You don\u2019t have to have a conversation with the person and as I said, it does not excuse what they did. Let it go, so you may live a longer, happier life. Forgiveness prayer: I\u2019m sorry Please forgive me I love you Thank you. Slowly repeat it for yourself several times and then for the other. I\u2019ve been coaching people how to do this for over a decade. What I will tell you is that those who don\u2019t forgive and let go suffer, gain weight, and have heart and other health issues. If that isn\u2019t enough for you I don\u2019t know what is. ",

Someone somewhere at some time must have done you terribly wrong for you to feel this way? but then ask yourself why am I blaming everyone for this act? Even if it is multiple acts, it is the same thing, because surely you have found others who would not even think of doing what ever was done to you. Why put everyone in the same basket? There is freedom in not feeling this way. You will be much better off if you can think your way thru this and realize that hate is a very strong emotion, and one that has no positive benefits. It can and will eat away at your soul, focus all your energy on trying to let go all the bitter thoughts of the time/times when you were abused or mistreated, and entertain good and positive thoughts of peace and happiness and forgiveness toward those who have affected you so. Continually remind yourself that everyone is not the same, embrace the good and leave the bad, learn to be thankful for the joy that you have and it will increase. Be greatful for each new friend that you make, that is kind and nice to you. Soon you will find yourself with a new perspective, and old things will pass away and all things will become new. ",

Hating someone is just a waste of time. It is not constructive , it doesn't generate results, and it does not make you a better person. If you can convince yourself so, your hatred will flow away. Still not convinced? Think of the big picture. Why is it that you hate the person. Is it a sequence of events leading to it, could it be something you are unaware of, of which a simple understanding can help clear it up? Then do the necessary,no point keeping doubts in your mind. Still not helping? Then why don't you look for things you like to do , distract yourself so the problem won't seem so big anymore? Other people we may not control, but we do what it takes to control how we think and feel. Give yourself the joy by appreciating the good things in your life. It is natural for people to make mistakes, is this one of them.? By giving the person the benefit of the doubt it relieves you the burden having to hate someone. Doesn't work. Maybe it could be a medical problem, seek professional help. ",

            "answer_text": "Unless you figure out how to stop hating someone and learn to deal with the people you hate, your life will be more difficult to handle due to excessive hate feelings. Nowadays things seems to work under the influence of hate than any other emotion making it a greater motivation behind most strong actions than love. There is this old saying that, hate cannot exist without love. And most at times, hate is always worst where love once was. But hate is not always brought by love lost but it can also be brought by so many years of piled up neglect and frustration that is, jealousy. Some people find it really difficult to deal with the hate in their hearts for probably, their siblings or their former friends, spouses, or colleagues, maybe because they were consumed by jealousy. According to psychologists, hate is as much an indicator of your own personality and not always because of someone else. You are more likely to have a hard time dealing with hate if you are among those who are generally unhappy and dissatisfied with life. That is to say, if there is something you had a tough time in getting you might likely develop hate for someone whom you think got same thing the easy way. Hate could also be as a result of what you went through in life because your past experiences determines what you are today. There are some people who their hate feelings revolve around one person in an entire group. For instance, you may develop hate for older men because you had an abusive father or you probably hate your boss because he reminds of that obnoxious uncle of yours who always hit on you even when you\u2019ve done nothing. One thing about hate is that it is pointless. It only bring more harm to you. The fact that you hate that \u201cbitch\u201d who happens to be your best friend\u2019s girl won\u2019t make your friend to dump her neither will she get a sleepless night you are the one who will have a restless night instead. Besides you hate her or not it your problem and not hers. Not just that, hate can also make you to loss a lot. For example, you refuse to go to your working team get-together just because you hate and can\u2019t stand some of your team mates and it so happens that, that annoying know-it-all in the next cubicle manages to become best pals with your boss over a few drinks, and sneaks away that coveted promotion right underneath your nose. Who\u2019s loss? Hatred can also make you blind towards people that truly loves you. If you busy hating on your ex who dumped you for another girl, you might not notice one of your friend who has been waiting patiently for you to get over your anger and hate and on the long run, he may eventually run out of patience and walk away. So also, your hatred for one single person can make you avoid other people you love just because you think you can\u2019t stand that person you hate. So, the best thing for you is to learn how to stop hating and understand how to deal with hate and only positive way you can do that is understand that you do more harm to yourself than to the person you hate making hate a worthless feeling. Now that you know how to deal with hate, go get yourself a better and happier life. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, this is a great thought indeed. Let me tell you one of my experiences. I was a short tempered person during my college days. It caused me lose many of friends because I was unable to control my anger. I was almost all alone because of this. I started hating myself. It inturn increased my anger towards everything. How someone can love others if a person starts hating himself! Days passed by. It was when I was on second year, a girl got department transfer and joined my class. Since she was new to the class, she started conversation with me. She would rather liked my presence and thus she wanted to have a good friendship with me. I was never changed and showed my anger towards her also sometimes. Sometimes she cried because my behaviour towards her was so rude. But she never complained about it. She continued her friendship and later we became best friends. Days passed. It was on our farewell day, I asked her what was there in me to like when everybody else doesn't see anything good. She told, 'I won't focus on what you did to me which went wrong. I always like focusing on what all things that went good.' Then, she was silent. Sometimes silence can tell a lot more than words! This was the turning point where I seriously changed my behaviour towards others. 1. When you focus on the positives of a person, you will never find any reason for hating that person. 2. Understand that situations only hurt one. So never hate the people. Trust them and obviously miracles do happen. ",

            "answer_text": "TL;DR Try to have genuine, non-emotionally-charged interactions with people from this group. What you want to do is to be able to empathize with the group - realize that they\u2019re people just like you, with desires and struggles just like you. Try interacting with people from this group in a neutral context (not a debate, not a super emotional situation). This should be some kind of in-person (preferably, though might be impossible given the circumstances), non-confrontational interaction. Not any kind of debate, not a conversation where opinions are expressed (because opinions = disagreements = deepening of negative feelings). There are good, funny and kind people in virtually any grouping of people you can imagine. The idea is to be able to think of this group as a bunch of human individuals. By empathizing with individuals, you\u2019ll begin to not see the group as just a faceless monolith onto which you can smear any kind of bias or accusation (since they\u2019re not there to prove you otherwise). By interacting with people from the group, you\u2019ll get to know their stories a bit better and no matter how different you may feel from them, you\u2019ll probably feel at least a little less different after you have a genuine, human-to-human interaction (without any of the politics or theoretical issues). You\u2019ll just have yourself and this individual in front of you, and hopefully you\u2019ll begin to feel the fact that whatever characteristic about them you hate is probably not their defining trait. They are a human being, just as complex and intricate as you. You\u2019ve made a fantastic step by acknowledging your feelings and realizing that these feelings are not good and should be worked on. Good luck to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Hate is such a strong and ugly word. Not to mention the energy one uses to hate someone. So my first question would be why do you hate this group? Do you have a legitimate grievance with them? Do you just hate them for something they can\u2019t control (i.e. skin color, gender, race, etc). Does your ignorance play a part in your hate? I personally cannot think of one person I hate, let alone a whole group. There are people I dislike or have no interest in being friends with. However, I\u2019m still polite and respectful to them because that\u2019s what God calls me to do. God is what keeps me from feeling hate. If you\u2019re not a believer then you need to find your own motivation to stop the hate. Whether that be to stop being ignorant because even a group of people all have their own beliefs and personality or maybe your just being judgmental. If you are judging people let me just say if you didn\u2019t die for them you do not have the right to judge them. Hate is taught or learned. You need to re-wire your brain and whatever triggers it to feel that hate. If you are a believer then I would suggest you talk with your pastor. ",

            "answer_text": "Nip the problem in the bud. Here is a sequence: We hate someone when we have become angry beyond a certain level. Our anger is the result of a trigger. There may be history as well. We do two things; quarantine the history and dampen the trigger to an amplitude insufficient to behave as trigger. Trigger is the result of our getting annoyed at a time when we are not expecting something from a person. IF WE PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE WORST AND LEASH THE IMPULSIVE REACTION, OUR ANNOYANCE LEVEL WILL STAY LOW. When we are ready for any bad situation (and that is for our benefit because we remain in an optimum thinking mode), we are more reason-prone and frontal-activated. We keep busy our executive brain thinking good reasons for a bad situation. Logic provides us many ways a person could behave abnormally and we are ready to forgive for whatever shenanigans one is up to. We consider ourselves superior in the sense that we control the situation (ensuring not feeling proud). I might have hated a chair in the dining room that came my way (!) injuring my toes on a number of occasions but that is always my fault. I set it back where it originally had been lamenting my own hastiness. How can I hate a person if I do not do any wrong. IF SOMEONE HATES ME, I WILL NOT RETURN IN THE SAME COIN; I WILL SAVE MY COIN FOR A BETTER USE! ",

            "answer_text": "The way you phrase the question makes it seem like it's not a choice. There's a story of a couple who wanted a divorce. The husband didn't love his wife, but before she granted him the divorce, she asked him to carry her up to bed each night for one month. He reluctantly agreed. Of course, the simple action of carrying his wife up to bed each night for a month changed everything and they stayed together. If love is an action\u2014and I believe it is\u2014then maybe hate is too. I know that hate is the emotion you feel toward a person, but if you chose to love the person with your actions, you'd have a tough time hating them emotionally over time.  If you want to stop hating someone, start loving them with actions.  Or another good option is to end your relationship with this person and forget about him/her. There are 7 billion people on earth, so unless this person is family, why not just get away from them and move on with your life? They're both good options. If they're family, I'd recommend the first option, otherwise, just get away from them and move on with your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Love and hate are the two most dominant feelings every humans have in them. It is very difficult to balance out or wipe out any of them. Hating someone is a natural process which is because of the feelings you have for the other person. This is primarily because other person had hurt you in any form.  You can avoid hating someone only if you follow these - 1. Don't have any expectations from anyone. Be self dependent as much as it is possible. Because if you start expecting from others and if that didn't happened as hoped, then it will offend you the most and you will start hating the other person. Start this as soon as possible. It will change you. 2. Hate is also a type of negative feeling. So, if you see positive side of everything you will not get any reason to hate others. Admire every moment of your life. I always try to appreciate others. Make it a habit. This will force you to see positive side of every situations. Practice saying \u201cI hate nothing about you\u201d in your mind.  These two things will be good enough to help you to avoid hating someone. Personally I would like to say that we are a result of so many mistakes we did in our past. So, forgive others as soon as you can. Making mistakes is a natural process everyone follows in their life. Don't hold grudges. Anger is the punishment we give to ourselves, for somebody's else mistakes. Be happy and relish your every moment of life. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Rethink your definition of 'hate'. The opposite of hate is not love. Love and hate are actually on the same side of the continuum. The opposite of love/hate is indifference. Consider the idea that by hating them, you are actually loving them too. If you think of the strength of your emotional connection with them as a bond that gets stronger as you nurture it, this bond is very important to you (otherwise you wouldn't hate this person). Try to imagine yourself loosening your grip on it. Let them become less important in your life, and the severity of your emotion toward this person will begin to diminish. Try to relax the emotional bond connecting the two of you and your hatred will dissipate. This probably sounds a lot easier than it will actually be. It will help matters if this person is no longer in your life at all (and if they're not immediate family, that should (hopefully) already be the case). Whatever reasons you have for despising them so much, consider that it is the strength of the bond between you that gives those things power over you. You decide how strong or weak (or nonexistent) that bond is. If that bond were to disappear tomorrow, and you had no more feeling for them than you did for a random person on the other side of the world, you would not hate them anymore: you'd have no reason to.

            "answer_text": "I think they can if they are committed to do so. The thing is that stop hating people is not easy task at all. This has to deal with the mindset and emotions. As you really know that hate means which is literally obvious that we have some anger inside against that person. If we want to stop ourselves from hating people then we have to learn about forgiveness. Learn to forgive and let go of emotions. You will know if you hate someone or not by checking your deep down emotions. Most people are confused they said they don\u2019t hate anyone (their minds tell them that) but inside thier emotions they don\u2019t feel right, there\u2019s a wall between them and the others. So if we can discern our emotions whether it\u2019s feeling positive, nutral or something negative. Once we can discern that and then we can make the decision that we want to forgive or not. And when we forgive we let go of hatred and yeah then we can stop hating people. It\u2019s not easy, it takes whole life to do this. At least, you can start step by step with dealing with some issues that people hurt us in the past until the present then it\u2019ll be better with the future which is yet to come. The reason that it takes whole life because we are all human, we do mistakes, both intentionally and unintentionally. However, when you don\u2019t hate doesn\u2019t mean you will like them after forgiveness or you have to recconcile with them, no forgivness and reconciliation are completely different. But when you don\u2019t hate it means you don\u2019t have any bitterness towards them. ",

I might hate some actions they have taken, but I don't hate THEM. Hate just leads to more hate. Learn to dislike instead of hate. Hate corrupts the soul and leads to all forms of vile thoughts and actions. Hate is what leads to most violence. If you really dislike someone, You can feel pity for their situation, sorrow for the life they are leading, anger at the horrible things they do, and all of these things are perfectly logical. But hate leads down a dark path of vengeance and then people begin to Hate you, which leads to them seeking vengeance on you Don't get on that merry-go-round of hate. Life is enough of a rollercoaster without getting dizzy too. ",

            "answer_text": "What is hate actually about? it is our mind\u2019s way fo protecting us. Its a survival mechanism purely as an instinct. If you dont like a person, your body will feel unpleasant sensations and emotions. To avoid being near them, your mind puts the emotion of hatred in you so you can stay away from them physically; thus avoiding the negative feelings and sensations you experience in your body. Hatred is essential in a human. You cant love unconditionally everything. Its unnatural to love everything in this world. There has to be dislikes and likes which balance life. Can you imagine eating sweets full life? Can you like all colors, all kinds of food, every music, all clothes, all people? No. You have choices and preferences. Hatred is a \u201cdark nature\u201d dimension present in all minds and a balance towards this dimension is required to ensure that you don\u2019t become imbalanced in this energy. It\u2019s not the dimension of hatred that\u2019s negative, it\u2019s when one becomes unconsciously lost in it that it becomes negative, it also tends to become negative when you suppress it (maybe you want to supress hatred towards this person which might seem unnatural to your mind). First answer the question: Why do you hate that someone? It\u2019s essential to understand why you hate them. Do you hate because\u2026 You are actually jealous of their achievements? Because you cant be like them ever? This is a powerful realisation and you must analyse it further. You feel angry that you cant have what they have. Maybe they have an easy life and for which you had to struggle for each and every thing.Is the person an \u201cevil/bad/unpleasant person\u201d but despite it you want to like them because it is the \u201cRIGHT THING TO DO\u201d and that hating is wrong?Do you feel physically threatened by them?Do they uncover hurtful memories in your past and thus release toxins in your blood leading to unpleasant bodily sensations?By doing deep introspection, you will get to the ROOT of your hatred. Your unmet needs, the different ways you get triggered or hurt all come floating to the surface. You cant force yourself to HATE someone neither can you force yourself to LOVE someone. The solution lies in FEARLESS, brutally honest self-discovery that will lead you to the answers. ",

Some things are unforgivable and some people had caused me so much pain I just wasn't able to do it.  Then one day, this may sound crazy, but I was watching Oprah and she was interviewing two sisters who had been molested by their father and brothers from age 6 on (talk about unforgivable!)  Then the question of forgiveness came up.  Well, Oprah was also a victim and her definition of forgiveness finally resonated with me and I was able to put it to use.   \"Forgiveness is letting go of the hope that the past could have been any different.\" -Oprah Winfrey ",

It's not, it's inside yourself, it doesn't affect them, they may not care or even know about it. Often, we feel on some level, that we can't let go of our hate. Like justice depends on us hating them, and to release those feelings is to accept their actions. That's not true. If they were wrong, they were wrong, but that's true no matter what you feel. Your hatred only affects you. Once you realize that your hatred exists inside your own mind, realize how toxic and corrosive it is. Like venom in your bloodstream. It does nothing to the person who you hate, and does a great deal of damage to yourself. Now, if you love yourself and want yourself to be happy, you need to let that hatred go. Put the other person aside. You can't control them, your emotions can't affect them. Decide, logically, how you'll deal with them, and let the emotions go. Decide to be happy. Happiness is incompatible with feelings of hate. Emotions are tricky things, and it can take a lot of effort to properly school your feelings. Acknowledge what you feel, acknowledge how it affects you, and decide to let those feelings go. ",

Emotionally, hatred hatred will take a heavy toll on you..... but probably not on the person you hate.Physically, hatred can create havoc on your body.... but not on the person you hate......Starting to see a pattern? When you hate someone, you do the suffering, not them, so if someone has done you wrong, It makes no sense to hate them because they may care less.You are punishing yourself, not the person who wronged you. Another thing to think about is this. If you ever hope to change the behavior of  this person that bothers you, hate is taking you in the wrong direction. When you take all that into account you will realize that by letting go of your hatred, you are not letting someone off the hook for any harm they have done to you. You are simply setting yourself free from something that is really bad for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost everyone is grey. I\u2019m assuming you hate said person because he / she ruins an aspect of your life. You think that that person is doing something morally wrong and you despise them for doing so. You feel that that person is evil and you begin to hate him / her. Initially, the hate is directed at that one aspect. Unfortunately, the problem occurs when the hate starts spreading to areas that don\u2019t deserve it. You start making decisions about that person that are not right simply because of that one unrelated aspect. To solve the spread of the hate to unrelated areas, remember that not everyone is evil. Whatever bad this person does, he / she also has a good aspect. Morality is not black or white. Neither is character. Character is a complex aspect. You cannot simply label someone\u2019s character as evil or good. People have different mixes of various virtues and vices. In fact, good literature often involves characters with lots of depth to them. Various aspects and characteristics coexist to constitute character. Remember that the person that you hate is not completely bad. Do not let your hate for his / her vices cloud your judgement. By all means, go ahead and decide what course of action you need to do to stop that aspect that you hate. However, don\u2019t let that get in your way of understanding the person completely and understanding his / her character. ",

            "answer_text": " Fear leads to anger leads to hate leads to suffering. Haters don\u2019t hate others, they hate themselves. Overwhelming fear finally leads to hatred towards self and later generalised externally. Hate breeds more hate, only love can cure it, its the eternal law. Learn to love ,trust, believe in yourself first and then implement it outwards.  We don\u2019t see things as they are, we see things as we are. What we think we become, with our thoughts we create our reality. No one will love and trust you if you don\u2019t do the same for yourself.  Much of our problems arise because of not facing the reality fair and square. Always be mindful of the present and your thoughts, learn to accept things /reality ,whether you like it or not. And let go things that are troubling you or are beyond your control. Those who try to control their fate never find peace.  Peace is what everyone seek, so find peace within. Every emotions, feelings, misery, pain, peace, all reside within. Make peace with yourself and lower down your expectations. None can walk your path, its upto you to save yourself as you yourself has to walk the path. Life is full of lustre, we just need to perceive it with neutral perception. There is nothing bad or good, its just our perception of comparing and learning things. Differences are created which actually doesn\u2019t exist. Everything is bound by harmony, understand the working of nature to find blissful peace and learn and understand about yourself. Everything is equal and has a purpose for its existence, despite being big, small,short, long etc. Rise above all and seek peace, and later self actualisation and self enlightenment. Everything is interconnected and nothing works in isolation. Everything is in constant motion, and our problems are riddled with time and working of things. Keep life simple , don\u2019t think ,just feel. Learn to let go of everything you fear to loose. Control your fear as its the root to all evil deeds and let go of your anger. Hate will banish along with sufferings when you come into harmony with self and the nature .  Learn the language of love. To understand new things sometimes we have to unlearn what we have learned.

She is weak to another guy. So definitely you will begin to hate that guy gradually because of feeling insecured. Be confident. Hating that guy can not change your desired girls mind. If you get closer to that guy, you may find something interresting into him. It is safe to stay on board instead of being off the board, isnt it? Hating can not do any better: We hate someone or something that contradict to our perspection. Suppose you are a fan of communism. So definitely you may not like the notion of capitalism. You may hate it. But hating capitalism can not erase it from the world. If you can change what you hate, then change it. If not, then move on. Who knows there is something you love is hated by others? Spend productive time: Yap. Dont let your brain waste concentration by hating someone. Get busy with some productive works like drawing, painting, writing and reading a lots of books as well as passing time with a proactice friend. Gossiping in a group may make you hate someone in that group. Life is short. Why waste it by hating people? ",

It could be that you feel insecure about the expectations of those you dislike and hate. It is most likely that you don\u2019t like the bad attitude and bad behaviour from those in society. Don\u2019t be quick to be playing the judge and jury role just because someone does something that is not of the norm or commits a heinous crime. It is better to stay positive in life rather than be controlled by your strong emotion called hate. Hatred is just like a cancer of the mind. I suggest that you change your attitude to a positive outlook on people. Stop judging others based on your own preconceived ideas about the standards, morals, and principles you feel must be obeyed and practised by every human being. ",

            "answer_text": "When we hate somebody we become irrational and obsessive. We even want to physically attack the subject of our hate but may be prevented by our inability to figure out whether it is the right time. Our judgement is greatly impaired.our self awareness and laughter is repressed. It\u2019s somewhat similar to romantic love except that feeling of physical attack isn\u2019t there in love and laughter isn\u2019t repressed. Irrational behaviour, obsession and impaired judgment are common characteristics. So many times we pair love with hatred. Hatred against an individual may be seemingly irrational and rooted in remote anthropological instincts. Hate based on race or religion would probably fall under this heading. On the other hand, an individual may trace the hatred to a past injustice and hence find a justifiable source for it. Having said this we can now think about ways of stopping to hate one whom we hate. We must try relaxation techniques to first rest our brain and it\u2019s irrational actions. It would help to rationalise our stance rather than justifying. Think about all the consequences it can have. It helps to be a little philosophical and trying to forgive and forget. If we did this then I am sure we may at least be able to stop hating and and become neutral. That would help us. Remember hate is like a poison which we are imbibing and hoping that other person dies. It doesn\u2019t happen that way. Hater is much more impacted. ",

Doing this makes forgiving them a lot easier. It also makes it easier to deal with them in the future because it puts everything they do in context and makes it easier not to take things personally. That being said, hatered is a strong emotion and if you feel it towards someone it can be hard to completely get past that, so a more realistic goal might be decreasing the amount of time you spend thinking about them or decreasing the amount of influence they exert over your emotions (i.e. making it so they can\u2019t ruin your mood as easily as they once could). You might never get over disliking them to some degree, but you can definitely decrease the intensity of that sentiment. I think this is the best approach because it focuses on what\u2019s most important- improving your emotional health. ",

I hate that there are people that go hungry while the U.S. government subsidizes growers to burn crops. This motivates me to give to organizations that feed homeless and impoverished people. Our ancestors hated that wild animals wold pick off their families while they were out hunting, so they developed housing and cities to keep them safe while they were away. Hate when directed towards a problem is useful, hate directed towards people is counter productive. When you hate a person that commits murder you may be tempted to take vengeance on that person perhaps even killing someone close to him to make him feel the same way, that\u2019s how you get the mob wars in the early 1900\u2032s\u2026 possibly even most wars. If on the other hand you hate murder it may lead you to create a system where murder is punished so severely and murderers are found so often that the risk to commit murder is too great to take and instead they find some other solution to the problem the proposed murder was intended to solve. Obviously this doesn\u2019t stop all murders, some people will do it in the heat of the moment without any thought, other will believe they can get away with it even though most of the murderers are caught. Point is, there are good things to hate, and bad things to hate. Don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game. ",

Another technique to try is to write a letter to the person ( don't send it) expressing your feelings and why you hate this person. Again, it depends on the situation and reason for your hatred. I tear up or burn the letters once I have written them, then wrote a second letter in which i accept responsibility for my feelings. If you hate the person for no other reason than he or she annoys you, it's possible that there's something about that person who reminds you of something you don't like about yourself. If you must live with this person ( a boss, co-worker or parent)and she constantly makes your life miserable, then it might be better for you to get away from the person.  Of course, talking about it with a therapist could help as well. As to confronting the person, again it depends on the situation.   ",

Although it may seem impossible it is one of the easiest things to do. I am a witness to it. Put your feelings away and do this. Sit in a quiet place, calm and clear your mind. Then let these words arise to your consciousness. Say the words out loud as you read them in your mind. \u201cI forgive you (persons name).\u201d That is all that is needed. For me it took one week and all bad feelings and the destruction that hate had on my soul melted away. This works by yourself but I think more satisfying or happier would be to use your higher power if you have one. Good luck. Oh, and don\u2019t stop trying because hate will hurt you much more than the other person. You must wash it away with forgiveness. By the way you don\u2019t need to have forgiveness as an emotion or thinking when you say those words. You can think anything along with it. You just need to see it, read it and say it. Good Luck ",

            "answer_text": "Your resentments, if not released, are parasitic. When we hold on to resentment, we are only tightening a noose around ourselves. For many people, myself included, we hang on to our resentments because we believe they are justified. For instance, \u201cI want to let go of my resentment towards [person], but: she doesn\u2019t even care that she\u2026\u201dhe never says\u2026\u201dthey won\u2019t stop doing\u2026\u201detc etc.When we believe we are justified in a resentment, we are telling ourselves that we have control over those aforementioned people. We believe that we have control over their thoughts and actions, and we simply can\u2019t change unless they adjust themselves to our liking. This belief is just as poisonous as resentment itself. That being said, releasing resentment is both incredibly simple and incredibly difficult. It is both as easy as, and as hard as, letting go. It begins with acknowledging your lack of power in the situation to do anything other than change your own way of thinking. I\u2019ve found that, to help bring some peace to my psyche that\u2019s ablaze with resentment, praying for the person in question helps. I pray that they receive the same love, comfort, and security that I have/want for myself (after all, who doesn\u2019t deserve that?) and leave it at that. I know that I value my time and energy enough to stop using it to actively hurt myself from the inside out. Once you release your death grip on a resentment, whether it be a long-term one towards someone who hurt you or a short-lived one towards the guy who cut you off on your way to work, you will know a new freedom. And with that freedom comes the precious freedom of choice: at long last we can choose to be happy. Best of luck to you.  ",

There is a second category, where the hate stems from the misdeeds of the other person towards you or because of the jealousy you feel towards them, or from the simple knowledge that the other person hates you. There can be hundreds of reason for somebody to hate you (or your hating somebody). A mean person hopes that all the other people are mean like themselves and when he encounter somebody who is not mean that can be a reason to hate him. When you hate people/ insects/ situations, you avoid them which is a natural thing to protect you. If a housefly pursue me continuously in the park I can get annoyed and lose my temper. However I am not going to lose my sleep thinking over the housefly or of the houseflies of the world. The key is to consider yourself to be the most important entity in the world and and then give space to the lesser elements in the world. I know this is not the widely preached philosophy of the world. But I think, if one spends enough time on the subject, one will realize that it is the people who thinks most about others are the people who brings harm to others.

The best way I have found to deal with it is as a long term solution I try to dissect what and why I am feeling hate then look at each reason from a different perspective. Usually you will find most people are just making it through the day, every day just like me. I call myself out for hating people for things I have also done or would possibly do in a similar situation. Along with a little informal meditation this has helped my outlook tremendously. In the short term give yourself a break. Take a day for you time, surround yourself with the things that make you happy. I like to revisit my favorite comedy films. Anything Mel Brooks makes me smile. A book, a drink and a good smoke help as well. If nothing helps, try talking to someone. Not necessarily a doctor or professional but someone who's opinion you respect and trust enough to be honest with you. It may help see things from a new angle. I hope this may have helped and I wish you better days ahead. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a difficult one. I don't think that you can stop resenting and hating someone. I fear I may have more questions than answers for you on this particular query. Are you being literal when you say hatred or is it a colloquial embellishment? There is clearly some mis-match between your personalities that causes friction leading to your resentment and hatred. Is the feeling mutual? Does the object of your in-affection feel the same way towards you? Are you very similar people with similar personalities? Do you understand why you feel resentment and hatred towards this person in particular? In a practical sense, if your dislike is as intense as your words portray then the only thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation. If possible, cut all contact with this person. Don't see them, don't speak to them and don't associate with them. Move on with your life and chalk it up to bad experience. The one deeper thought I have gnawing away at my curiosity is; do you care about this person? I believe that you have to care to love but also to hate. In my own experience, if there were somebody I strongly disliked I would simply \u201cnothing\u201d them. No hatred, no Ill will, nothing. I wouldn't give him or her a second thought. ",

It's best to just cut off all contact, especially if they did something horrible and unforgivable. If for some reason you can't avoid the person, try to forgive what happened and move on. You don't necessarily have to forgive them, but make peace with yourself with your own mind and inner turmoil. Do things that will help prevent you from thinking about them or find a hobby that will help you overcome the situation better yourself. If this person has become your enemy, try to become better than they are. Competition is healthy and using your hatred as a driving force to become a better version of yourself is the best revenge.

The way it\u2019s phrased, it sounds to me like you just hate people in general. If so, why? What happened that made you view all people as bad, untrustworthy, or otherwise undesirable? I mean, you don\u2019t hate people with no reason, but maybe you have very general reasons, nothing specific to any one individual. And that may be part of the answer. Do you even see people as individuals? Or are they all just part of the collective \u201cpeople?\u201d If so, start trying to distinguish between people. That might help. Is it your goal to be alone? Because you\u2019re off to a great start by simply hating people on principle. Or do you mean you hate certain people and would like to see them differently? In that case, I\u2019ll give you an analogy someone gave me. He compared people to computers. The completely innocent and loving baby is the mother board. The rest is just the programing. It is not the computer that is bad, it\u2019s just the software. If your computer has bad software, you don\u2019t get rid of the computer, you just get rid of the software. So, if you can see the person as the motherboard \u2013 that is, as the innocent baby \u2013 not the programing, you will find a way to maybe not like the person, but to at least free yourself of the hatred. And that\u2019s in important point. Hating someone does nothing to them. You\u2019re the one it hurts. It takes a lot of energy to hate someone. Why would you waste your energy like that? You get no return on it. And surely you can find a better use for that energy than to hate. ",

A premise in Neurolinguistic Programming suggests that behind every behavior is a good intention.  Yes, that is right a good intention.  Some people commit horrendous acts BUT if their experience of life has only been cruelty then they can only live what they know.  And if you encounter them they are only living what they have experienced which has NOTHING to do with you EXCEPT for the fact that you believe their behavior is somehow about you.You can overcome hate by learning not to personalize.   My Buddhist practice has given me greater insight into human nature, helped increased my degree of objectivity so that I personalize less, and raised my level of self-esteem so I am not dependent upon others people's behavior as an indicator of my self worth.

            "answer_text": "A very good question: How does one stop hating on people? Hate, many times, is actually a form of love. Self love. If you\u2019ve been hurt, you might hate not only the people who hurt you but especially the ones that may hurt you. That\u2019s just about everyone, even yourself. You might be really angry at yourself for trusting the \u201cwrong \u201c people. So you don\u2019t trust yourself, you don\u2019t trust others, no one is trustworthy, and that is hateful. That, my friend, is the key. Trust. Don\u2019t have fear of bad experiences. Each one teaches you something that has so much worth. The truth is there are no bad experiences just uncomfortable ones. So, start with trusting yourself. Trust your intuition. The outcomes are always a positive. Life is about experiences and learning, over and over again. If you hate, you must learn to trust. It\u2019s quite a difficult lesson to learn. Even painful. Sorry. So, moving on, if you trust yourself, you can start to love yourself. That\u2019s a huge lesson too. After you love yourself and you do not harbor fears of experiences, because no one can harm you, you might stop hating others and recognize the most important lesson of all\u2026 humans only act on love because that\u2019s all there is. Many seemingly bad deeds are rooted in love. Love of one self, love of justice, love of a god\u2026 Even hate is rooted in love. So forgive yourself for hating. Because you ARE Love itself. ",

I try to look for something positive in such people, and use that information to establish contacts and engage them in talk with me. Later as the contacts develop and theystart listening to me, I point out the areas where they can improve, and watch the response. If they are receptive, I try to help in any way I can. But if there is resistance, I just leave them to their ways and mind my own business. Even at that stage, I refuseto let my mind hate even that person. That is because, even I am reluctant listen to sermons from people who do not understand why I have a situation,opinion or problem. ",

Learn or rather find out the difference is between hating someone and having a dislike for someone.

            "answer_text": "This human emotion of hate can be straightly defined as disliking all actions taken by a person irrespective of understanding his/her intentions to do them. This creates a lot of stress as you believe whatever he/she is going to do or say is going to cause you trouble. Now why does this happen? Does that person purposefully try to cause you harm or is it all in your mind? Many times we hate a person because he/she possess some quality or thing(maybe materialistic) that we wish to have sub-consciously. We somehow envy that person and we know that any which ways we aren\u2019t going to achieve it so the easiest policy we choose is that the \u201cgrapes are sour\u201d and we start talking and thinking evil.What we fail to realize is that hating him/her is not going to make us any superior. The best way to stop hating anyone is firstly focus on yourself. Elevate your own game so that whatever you want pursues you. Hating the other person is funnily hating yourself. If you have the time to hate someone else it means you have no time to love yourself. If you know your own strengths and weaknesses and are already busy in improving yourself there will be no reason to look for someone to hate. RISE ABOVE HATE!!! ",

That kind of information is critical in providing a good answer. What I can suggest is a series of steps to create indifference. First, get serious about reducing the importance of this person in your life. Replace that person\u2019s role with somebody/something else. Avoid social interactions with them for at least one year. Stop discussing this person with other people. This is how you deaden their impact on you. Remove all references to them from your social media. Block and remove their contact info. Stop seeing people who talk about him/her or think this person is just peachy. Shift your social life away from contact. After a while, it all gets old and dusty and no longer has any real meaning. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Hate\" tends to come from focusing on negative ideas. Often the negative ideas are based on assumptions about people who may be different in some way. Usually the assumptions are based in fear. By finding commonalities you can focus your attention on the positive aspects of the person. For example, often opposing governments tell their people that anyone from the country the government opposes can't be trusted. They breed fear and hatred grows. The reality is the people of both countries want peace and it's the governments that want war. We can obliterate hate and fear by looking at each person as an individual and realizing we all want the same things: peace, security, to be happy and to be able to feel comfortable in our surroundings. Our differences make us unique and we can learn from each other. It's about learning to love each other and respect each other's uniqueness.  ",

I am assuming you are asking about hate towards other people rather than something like \u201cI hate calculus!.\u201d (Sorry math geeks!) I don\u2019t think you can. Hate has existed as long as man has been in existence. We (the human race in general) are taught that those who differ from us in race, culture, appearance, personality, gender and everything else are to be hated or feared in some cases. I think that often, hate really is based in fear and if you could get people to spill their guts on this topic, you\u2019d see that. Sometimes people hate based on experience \u2014 I\u2019ve known plenty of white people who had one too many negative encounters with an African American and so \u201chate\u201d the whole lot of them (which leads to discussions of racism, best left on another post). Likely, those experiences made them afraid. It sounds silly, logically, but it happens. We want to tell ourselves that we look at everyone objectively, but we don\u2019t \u2014 we all come with baggage and ingrained beliefs about \u201cothers.\u201d Some of us unfortunately are raised to hate \u2014 think of the Neo Nazis and their nonsense about anyone who isn\u2019t white and Christian. You can recognize hate in yourself at least and work to overcome it. It\u2019s a start. But I don\u2019t think you will ever eliminate it from the human race. ",

I believe that's what's happening with the police force and or any law enforcement. People have grown to hate them based on the terrifying experiences depicted on the news and in-person experiences. If they don\u2019t remove the corrupt offenders, they poison the minds of everyone. Nothing in the human race is 100% good or 100% bad. Take time to know individuals before making any judgments. I never had any bad experiences with law enforcement but I'm terrified of what can happen to African Americans and minorities. It looks like if you get arrested, you won\u2019t make it to jail alive. I don\u2019t want to see anyone get hurt. ORIGINAL QUESTION: How do I stop hating a certain group of people? ",

It does not benefit you what so ever to have your energy towards hating someone. Even thinking of how much you hate them is letting them take up space in your head. Do not allow it to consume you. If you are naturally a kind and loving person, continue to be exactly who you are despite hating them, chose to simply not acknowledge them unless you absolutely need to. I hope this helps, I\u2019ve been there too, hating many people and I feel it\u2019s not even worth my time or energy. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think that hate is a generic emotion. You haven't told us *why* you hate this person, and that reason would have told me what kind of hate you're experiencing.  Probably the two most common types of situations that inspire hate in young people are 1) perceived unfairness by the more powerful, and 2) jealousy or envy. In both cases, feelings of powerlessness and deprivation fuel the hatred. Thus, working on oneself to develop feelings of empowerment, competence, efficacy, and serenity will starve hatred of the fuel it needs to keep burning. Cultivating mindfulness through meditation can be very helpful. Emotions like hatred are exciting, and can make one feel that one's life is more filled with meaning. But ultimately they are more destructive to the person living with them than to the object toward which they are directed. ",

But at times when I failed, I had a big need to degrade people. However, I do not say anything out loud. One day, a Myanmar girl, who did not speak English very well, had to begin a representation in front of my Art class, in the United States. She spoke nothing like English; it sounded like another language. People laughed (not mockingly; it sounded so strange). I had to resist an urge to laugh, too. At last, I chuckled. Then I felt terrible. I suffered from the fear of speaking English for the first time myself. I kept looking away because I knew that if I paid more attention, I would continue to chuckle. Then, a thought appeared to me. \u201cLinh, look at that girl. Observe her yourself. Is she doing anything bad? Is she harming you? Isn\u2019t she brave to get up and speak in public? Keep looking at her. Look beyond her accent. Study her face. Feel good for her.\u201d That moment was when I stopped being a jerk in my own head. I truly understood that feeling bad about someone, regardless of the reason, will do nothing to help me. What do I do? Get rid of that feeling. Some embarassing moments led me to discover that if repeatedly stop oneself from thinking of something, eventually he/she will forget it. ",

What changed this is when surrendered to Jesus Christ as Lord of my life and saw my sin for what it was. He should have and had every right to hate me for my sin, but instead he died and hung on the cross and rose again to provide forgiveness for me and save me and teach me how to love others when they sin or hurt me or others. This is not always easy, but God is love and when we truly love him, he loves others through us even when in our flesh we might hate them. He also taught me hating is destructive to me and my relationships as we carry hatred into every area of our lives. When we see how much God loves us and we didn\u2019t deserve it, we grow in grace and love toward others. This doesn\u2019t mean you will have relationship with everyone but you will extend grace and love and forgiveness as you learn that in doing so frees you to live your life with his love, joy and peace.

            "answer_text": "Psychological speaking, it is difficult to detach an emotion towards a thing. It is possible, of course, like people say nothing is impossible but it depends, highly, on your confidence and perception. You need to first rejudge them. Start thinking them as, just a normal person. A person, whom you don't hate or love. Try seeing the good things they do. Ignore the bad things. The fusiform gyrus and the limbic system is responsible for this. It will take lot of practice to make it believe that you don't hate that person. I am deducing that, you will ignore anything which happens with respect to the person, next time don't do that. Stand in a mirror and talk about it. Read about, or learn about them. You will soon loose some of your hate. It is difficult to feel detached but, you can reduce the hate or feel love towards them, depending on the case and judgement.

            "answer_text": "To be honest, I don't anybody. And I work hard for it. Over the period, it has become quite easy. Let me explain you the process. First of all, try to locate the root cause of hatred. Is it because of destroyed expectations, or some betrayal or some selfish intentions of person leading to hurt, some actions not in favour of you, or mere jealous leading to hatred or irritating nature or probably because there is no reason at all (it happens at times). Secondly, try to release your emotions you hold for the person. It can start by reducing your expectations from the person, forgiving the person and ignoring the person for whoever or whatever he is and has done. Your hatred in a way proves you have some expectations and feelings for the person. So you need to stop doing that and moreover be mature enough and forgive the person irrespective of whether he or she deserves it. This is not for him or her, but for your own mental peace. Thirdly, don't think or care for the person. So you move out and part ways with the person if possible. If it's not possible, then try to avoid engaging conversation with him or her or at maximum, keep it purpose to purpose basis for talks. Fourthly, focus on your mental health and mood. They should be more precious than the person. If you get distracted and hurt by the person, you are indirectly giving him or her the power to control you and your mood. So you can meditate or do yoga or try something like hobbies or something. And remember there would be many people who will get on your nerves, but be the better man or woman and remain insulated with respect to your feelings for him or her. I hope I answered your query.

When you understand that people are people and they are doing their best to make it in a crazy world it's easier to give them the benefit of the doubt and not hate them for their actions and decisions. Unless they're psychopaths and even then I would more pity than hate them. ",

You can\u2019t change what someone did to make you hate them. You need to process through the reaction and emotions of hate, much like one moves through grief in various stages. But then you stop rehashing what happened and you go on with your life. The more you rehash past, hateful events, the more harmed you are by what was done. Protect yourself by limiting the influence this person has over your thoughts and emotions by just getting them out of your life and not thinking about them anymore. There are more pleasant things.

Tell yourself that there are many people just like them, so they are accepted and have worth.       Stop your anger towards them.  Keep in mind that they are not trying to be you,  be like you, or be accepted as anything other than what they are, so you don't have to be mad at them for falling short of being what they are supposed to be.       Remind yourself that people are hating on you for something too, only you don't know what it is. ",

I became more and more solitary, enjoying my life more as I did so, blocking out the annoying humans who seemed to thwart happiness. Now, I work at home and only see a precious few individuals, including my husband and son, and when possible, my youngest sister, who lives far away. Most people would consider this a lonely life but I have a rich imagination and enjoy many things, such as music, movies, writing, reading and meditating. Try it!

Our faults as a species are easy to see. The media don\u2019t help\u2014there\u2019s nothing negative that they don\u2019t thrill at promoting to prominence because it gets our attention, and earns them cash. As to hating yourself, that\u2019s more personal and I won\u2019t attempt to guess at what\u2019s going on there but from my own experience this is a combination of internalizing the opinions of others and comparing yourself to others you feel are better than you, more successful, more attractive, whatever is important to you. Work backward. Question everything you believe about yourself. My guess is that a lot of it is bogus. We all have faults, internal and external. If you have expectations of perfection, lose them fast. Much of what we are we cannot control, nor can we control much of what happens to us. We can, however, modify our attitudes and perspectives. If there\u2019s something about yourself you don\u2019t like that can be changed, take action to change it. Otherwise, accept it for what it is. You are more than all of this. Understand as well that you are not alone in your suffering. Focus outward and see what you can do to alleviate the suffering of others, and more than that, see what you can do to bring something positive into existence. As for humans, take a second look. Look at the selflessness of parents, the sacrifices that some make to benefit others, at activists trying to bring about positive change, at the random acts of kindness that occur every second. No, we\u2019re far from perfect and it\u2019s easy to be cynical, but humans are also capable of marvels. You have to open yourself to see these, and this starts with being kinder to yourself. ",

Consider it a sign to attend to the core principle underlying all Psychological heath - paying attention to your emotions as they come up & positively dealing with them.

The anger will change into laughter and than gradually the feeling of hatred will disappear. \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a something very funny but not working. Although i haven't tried it because i always have my anger higher than anything else. Later i tried to control my emotions and realise that hatred is an emotion which has fire in it. When you hate someone you ignite fire in your own mind which eventually hurts you not him. After so many years i finally realised that my teacher was right. Laughter is a therapy to cool your mind and relax it and on the contrary hatred and anger is something that burns you inside. So he was right. So my dear the best way to avoid hating someone is to move your attention towards something light and relaxing. Cheers ! ",

My advice for you is don't be so quick to judge. Give a chance to those who deserve it, so they can prove you that Humanity isn't a lost cause yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Toxic thoughts could be very debilitating. First area I would suggest looking into is what are the circumstances that thoughts of these people come up with you? Are other people in your life bringing their names up? Are they people in your life who you blame for missed opportunities? Depending on the transgression they did to warrant your negative feelings, would determine how you address this issue. If there was a significant issue that warrants your hatred, such as sexual abuse, it may require a different approach. If these individuals are someone you blame for your current situation and feel stagnated because of them, your preoccupation with them is serving as a deterrent to moving forward. Identifying the function or purpose of these thoughts would be a productive first step. I would suggest the next direction to go, if you recognize that these are not thoughts that would warrant the attention mentioned above, we identify these thoughts as intrusive, counter productive, and irrational thoughts. Picture yourself as a gatekeeper.  If you allow certain thoughts to enter, you are opening the flood gates to more thoughts.  Do not give these thoughts credibility. By externalizing these thoughts, it gives you a better chance at dismissing them before they gather up momentum. If these thoughts become more problematic and don't go away, it may be helpful to seek out further assistance  to address them more aggressively. . ",

It depends on how frequently you think about the people you hate. A slight introspection on what triggers hate might help.. If they are external like places, people, or some objects etc. there is nothing wrong in avoiding them for a while. If it is intrinsic, due to result of train of thoughts, I would distract myself into doing something that keeps me busy either physically (workout, long drives etc) or mentally (music, watching comedy shows, movies etc.) On a side note, this may seem like a weak approach since we try to avoid the situation. But at the end of day, I find it much comforting to discard and move on with things than simply brooding. And this technique works for most negative thoughts, not just for hate :) ",

            "answer_text": "By stopping to care about that someone. If you hate someone, it means you care. You care either because (A) that person took away something you enjoyed (hate inspired by hurt), or (B) has something you would enjoy but feel you are unable to get (hate inspired by envy). A. When you are hurt, focus on building confidence. Confidence that you are able to get what has been taken away, also without that person. Once you manage to do that, your hate will subside. B. When you are envious, admit it to yourself. Admit that this person who is so different seemingly getting things so easily, has nothing to do with you or your ability to get the same or better. Admit that you want similar things. All roads lead to Rome: you just have to focus on walking your own road to the extent you stop caring about that other person. This is the way to stop hate inspired by envy. Hope that helps! :) Erik  ",

A positive mindset will make sure you dont hate anyone and respect everyone for who they are.If you dont hate anyone its one of the beautiful qualities you have because as human beings we tend to criticise, judge and hate people at times for their actions or what they did.I dont hate anyone and anytime you feel that negative emotion of being sad or being angry on someone. Just close your eyes and send out love to that person. Doing so would attract same love and happiness back to you.The world is full of beautiful human beings and not every one is same every one is different. It simply means you understand people and dont want to disturb your peace of mind. Hence you are positive and dont hate any oneCheers :)",

There are a few individuals whom you will despise completely, but most people will just have an annoying behaviour or another character trait will end up being irritating or unwelcome. If you do not get to know the person, you will only remember the strongest impression you have of him/her, which will be his/her irritating feature. Should you nurture a true curiosity for people, you will learn that everybody has a story, an enjoyable trait, an amusing piece of information or something else to share. In the end, your opinion about the person may change, either for better or worse. At least you will have tried and exercised empathy, which is always good. ",

If you can remove yourself from their lives, say a prayer for them and release the anger to the world and move on. \\U0001f60a Hope you got all the help you need, And that we could help. ",

It may be something that you learned very young to suppress yet it still ekes  out somewhere in your life, even if as an intolerance to that trait.  It may be something hidden behind a blind spot.  Maybe ask a friend to help see it. I just this week had to look at the narcissist inside me when I was hating on someone I claimed was a narcissist.  It's not pretty but man is it freeing once you come clean with yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: the answer is relative. I haven\u2019t been around for very long, but I'm learning over and over again that every problem can be solved by one solution - education. Let\u2019s use the horrific, violent examples of rising global islamophobia - these delusional people really think that they're doing good, and that there are \u2018terrorist\u2019 or \u2018security threats\u2019 - because they lack the education to understand. Of course, many of these small minded individuals have become the thing they sought to destroy: White nationalism, born in the USA, is now a global terror threat, White American men are a bigger domestic terrorist threat than Muslim foreigners, The Terrorism That Doesn\u2019t Spark a Panic. Finding the root cause is also a key to this solution - and addressing online communities is a part of the problem. By having these places online, where they can interact with people with similar views definitely has an impact on their behaviour, maybe emboldening them (or encouraging them) - the new Zealand mosque shooter streamed his massacre (which was obviously taken down by host sites) there must have been some audience. I would argue that we could reduce the hatred by having extreme control over these internet communities. Essentially mass-banning, terminations of accounts and deleting of groups which are proponents of any form of hatred. You have to stop people picking up the behaviour, so it\u2019s in early education where we need to stamp out these kinds of sentiments. Some may say it is human nature, or refute the point of education being the solution to complex issues like this because you can lead the horse to water, but you can\u2019t make it embrace multiculturalism.

In my opinion, the development of hate had a survival benefit in the tribal days of human development and helped secure the tribal territory and protect the social bonds within the tribe. When perceived threats were encountered from other tribes, the art of dehumanizing and hate generation was employed to support actions against the other tribes. I will not go into the ERA develop in human history but keep in mind that the hunter and gatherer ERA gave way to the agricultural ERA over a very long period of time. This allowed the tribal structure to merge into ever larger groups of people with common beliefs and cultures. As the ERA progressed religion and other belief systems grew very powerful in the management of human affairs and economic development. Major conflicts developed as the belief systems fought for maximum control of the population. Hate was used as a motivation to sacrifice in support of the belief systems. It is still in existence in various forms but this partial answer is long enough. ",

Maybe the person deserved the hate; maybe not. It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014you are living with those emotions. The best path is to try not to be consumed by hate. Acknowledge that it is there, but you wish it were gone. Often, time is the best healer, along with doing certain things to keep that person out of your head. Try hard to stay out of his or her path. Block them on sites like Facebook or Twitter. Write a letter you never intend to send in which you purge yourself of this hate. After a while, you may see a pattern. Maybe you don\u2019t hate this person, but you hate what he or she did. Maybe you can get past whatever that is. Hate is bondage, so it is good to escape it, but it isn\u2019t easy. If you can get to a place where this person doesn\u2019t matter anymore, then you have conquered hate. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to be friends with him or her, let them back into your life or engage with them in any way. You just don\u2019t want your hate to own you and your emotional life. So I would start with that. ",

Instead of exhausting yourself trying to bottle up a feeling no one can bottle up, it's better to direct your energy towards something (or someone) better for you on the long run. When you have been truly wronged, it's normal to feel hatred and anger.  But you don't have to do or say things that actually make your life worse.  ",

Do they think it affects us? It doesn\u2019t. They\u2019e the ones holding the hatred, while we are going about our daily lives and shaking our heads in pity for them. So, really I don\u2019t have time to dwell on hating anyone. Life is too short, and I choose to live it fully and on my own terms. I won\u2019t waste time hating anyone.

No. I would rather move on to something more fun and joyful. Does this feeling make the world a better place, a place I want to live in? No. There is already way too much hatred in the world.

You are not doing it for the other person, you are doing it for your own mental health. Hate is a consuming emotion, it can take over, turning a person into a bitter, mean being. Letting go of hate does not mean you have to make amends, or reconcile with the person you d not like, you can still have nothing to do with that person, it is simply freeing your mind. ",

Never compare yourself with anyone and always be the real you. Don't get jealous of anyone's success and remember that even one day you too will be successful and have faith. When following your goals and dreams forget about the world and never worry about their views and opinions about you because whatever you do , you will do it for your own good and not to please them. If you fail to do so , then the world will not let you to be the real unique you and this shall result in hatred. Cheers! ",

Also when you\u2019re laying on your bed at night, just imagine all the things you would want to say without censorship. Hopefully that helps. But specially the psychoanalyst part I recommend Try counseling yourself or someone in that same position maybe even answering a question like yours of someone else that they have asked. Hating is not bad, yes it feels awful and you could sure have some deep serious things to talk about. Some deep rooted totally justified reasons. It\u2019s important to express those, you should feel free. I know it\u2019s hard, I also feel I\u2019m hating everyone, and we all have our reasons. I recommend psychoanalysis as an efford in a safer direction to try to escape this living hell. Good luck xoxo ",

The one that is being hated only has to deal with the hater on occasion. In addition, if you hate someone, it will probably have negative effects on your positive relationships. This doesn\u2019t mean hating is never justified, but I think it\u2019s better to understand why you hate someone and figure a way of channeling the feeling so it can be resolved or at least reduced.

The way it effects you is that it eats the old you alive and makes you into a less nice and considerate person. On the flip side, showing forgiveness shows maturity. Life is too short to carry such internally destructive emotions in out hearts. Forgive but never EVER forget. I am no expert at life and questions regarding the philosophy of daily life is different between everyone, but I think every one knows that hate is harmful in the long run. The answers to questions are very subjective, but this is my input. Hope this helps, Jared :) ",
