            "answer_text": "My knee jerk response here is to give this question serious thought, and my response would be the 90s. You had Nirvana, Sublime, the Wu Tang Clan, (you had Old Dirty Bastard of the Wu Tang Clan, the most original and incredible rapper of all time), and because of them and others like them, the 90s were the last good decade for music. The 90s certainly weren\u2019t the best decade for good music, but they were the last. Not just in my opinion either; that\u2019s a hard fact. WARNING: VIDEO BELOW IS EXPLICIT (in the best kind of way)  (Are you gonna argue with this guy?) But when I slow down a bit, when I stop, I clearly see the trap that\u2019s been laid out for me \u2026 and I\u2019m not gonna fall in it today. Not today! Because what you\u2019re really asking me, good sir or madam, is simply this: \u201chow old are you?\u201d One thing I\u2019ve learned along the way about music is that we all love what we grew up listening to more than all the other shit that\u2019s out there. If you grew up in the 60s and 70s you\u2019ll be grooving to classic rock like The Who, Zeppelin, the Beatles, Dillon, or perhaps, God help us all, the Bee Gees, and as for everything else, it\u2019s just not \u201cfar out\u201d in the way your music is. If you grew up in the 30s and 40s, you\u2019ll probably be doing the Jitterbug to some Bing Crosby, Benny Goodman, or Glenn Miller, and the junk the kids listen to is basically sacrilegious. Did you see the way he shook his hips!?! It\u2019s a cultural trend that\u2019s stuck on repeat, generation after generation it stays pretty much the same, although it does feel like the rules are getting looser as we go. Let me explain: Young people listen to their music, and then they get older and they still listen to their music. They may listen to newer stuff, and they may even love some of it, but it will never be as good as their music; the music of their youth. And mostly they won\u2019t understand the new music. They just won\u2019t get it. And then they\u2019ll have kids of their own, and they\u2019ll think to themselves \u201cthis is what they like? This trash? It\u2019s literally the worst shit I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d, and they will shake their heads in bewilderment. And their kids will listen to their newfangled music. And then they\u2019ll get older and they\u2019ll still listen to their music. And then they have kids, and the circle continues, ad infinitum. But like I eluded to above, it seems like these days parents are staying \u201cyoung and hip\u201d a lot longer than before. Please notice I\u2019ve put \u201cyoung and hip\u201d in quotes, because they (we) are actually neither of those things. And I can say that because I am one hundred percent one of those parents.  So the real answer to your question is, of course, that there is still good music and there will always be good music. It\u2019s just your taste that, with the flow of time, has become lame and outdated. Admittedly though, you have to look a lot harder for the good stuff these days because there\u2019s just so much music out there. We\u2019re oversaturated for sure, and it makes it harder to find what you really love. Unless of course you\u2019re into auto-tuned, talentless music with zero instruments, words you can\u2019t understand and would be disappointed if you could, and the same three songs being repeated over and over. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, just look around you cause that\u2019s what\u2019s hot these days! Sorry, had to get that last bit in. I\u2019m old and bitter, after all. ",

            "answer_text": "The 70s. Not all the digital crap, things were new\u2026sounds and styles. Now they\u2019re just repeats and remakes. Pop music today in whiny. And it follows formulas. I\u2019m a jazz and blues guy. Jazz and blues is pretty traditional and there are some very fine young jazz / blues musicians out and about. But they have a tough row to hoe. The dudes in those record company ivory towers want commercial, commercial, commercial\u2026Back in the day they wanted music and innovation. ",
