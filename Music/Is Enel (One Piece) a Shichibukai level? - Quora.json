            "answer_text": "Enel is un-doubtable the most underrated character in One Piece. He was from one of the fewest characters who has hinted about Haki. Enel has shown very developed Observational Haki in the very early stage of One Piece.  as you can see in this Panels you can clearly see he has observational Haki. Maybe its describe in another way but we have seen in recent arc how this has worked. The reason we all consider him so weak and he lose from Luffy Because Luffy\u2019s DF is the natural enemy of Enel\u2019s DF. Which makes that arc Possible other Luffy\u2019s cant defeat Enel and other than that in Luffy Vs Enel Luffy has quite a lot of trouble defeating him because Enel can predict Luffy\u2019s attack. Luffy then has to get out of consciousness to become unpredictable.  Now coming toward the real Question is Enel Shichibukai Level. After knowing his true power and his ability it's fair to say he is Shichibukai level. The thing is Oda has introduced him so early in the Series because of which he loses his value as a character and in our minds, he is considered as the weak character. The skills and Abilities I have mentioned above clearly indicate he is capable of being the level of Shichibukai. Other than that he is also highly skilled Fighter and he knows how to use his DF. The real comparison only can be made if we get to see Enel in the recent events and how strong he is and then the fair comparison can be made. all these are just speculations and our imagination what might be possible. Hope it help. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Its hard to define what Schichibukai level is. Mihawk is on par with Shanks, a Yonko, but Buggy is weaker than an average marine captain. Kuma, Doflamingo, and Hancock are massively powerful, Moria wasn\u2019t. For the sake of the question, let\u2019s say the WG doesn\u2019t actually know how weak Buggy is and make Moria the low end. No. Enel is impressive in a vacuum, but in the grand scheme of things, he\u2019s not that big of a deal. His devil fruit is incredible, but that\u2019s all he has going for him, and he has classic Logia overconfidence. The moment Luffy showed resistance to his power, he lost composure and panicked. Just about anyone with a decent level of Haki could beat Enel\u2019s powers, and he just doesn\u2019t have anything to fall back on. ",
