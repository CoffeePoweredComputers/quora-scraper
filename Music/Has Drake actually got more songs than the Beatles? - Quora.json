            "answer_text": "On the surface, I very much doubt it. For a start, around 2006/7 he released a debut recording - so that\u2019s what, 11 years for 1 man to accrue more songs than a band containing 3 songwriters (although Ringo wrote 1 song with the assistance of George Harrison) managed to achieve in 10 years. That\u2019s remotely possible, but highly unfeasible. Furthermore, in 2014 he was sued for sampling a song; in 2015 a collaborator alleged Drake had used ghostwriters during a recording session. That was 1 of many issues dogging Aubrey Drake Graham (his birth name); most of them involving physical altercations with contemporaries such as Chris Brown & Diddy (a.k.a. Puff Daddy - among numerous other monikers) - so one must reason as to whether he had enough time to write (produce?) enough songs to rival the Beatles\u2019 catalogue, which by comparison was far more broad from a musical perspective.

            "answer_text": "Who knows? Who cares? Even if he has 5 million songs does it matter? They're not going to be as great as The Beatles. No one\u2019s going to care about Drake in a 100 years time unlike The Beatles who will still be the benchmark that everyone else will be measured by. It's not difficult to write a song. What's difficult is writing a good song. I write songs. I could write ten songs today but it doesn't mean any of them will be any good. It's not about quantity, it's about quality. I'd rather have one good song than a hundred bad or okay songs. ",
