(edit: I couldn\u2019t add some tips before because I was on mobile, but here they are:) I have no idea how much experience you have with these, but ipiccy is very easy to use and basic.  You want to work with .png pictures always. This is because they allow for transparency, so you can get photos of your idols without the backgrounds, and overlay graphics such as flower crowns or designs over and under without covering others. You can tell if an image you search on google has a transparent background if it is checkered like so: Transparent:  Not Transparent:   If you have a normal image like the last two, whose background you want to erase: Click \u201cupload photo\u201d, upload it and double click it once its done. Then scroll down and start erasing the BG. (You can also do this by applying a Mask in the Layers Tab). When you\u2019re done click the save button and MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT AS A PNG, NOT A JPG!   When you have all the Transparents you need, you can start layering the on top of each other to make the cool edits you see everywhere.  Select Make a Design. Select the BG color and dimensions of your canvas.  You can now layer your images, vector stickers, text, or make your own vector shapes to layer on top of each other. All your layers are visible in the tab to the left. Be creative! Save when you\u2019re done! Have fun! iPiccy is one of the best free photo editing tools out there, and it\u2019s really fun once you get the hang of it. Don\u2019t be afraid to explore. Here\u2019s a couple edits that I\u2019ve done using iPiccy (Sorry for showing off, but I love sharing them with people, lol):  Source  Source  Source Even more B.A.P edits ",

That edit has probably been done with Photoshop. Photoshop however is a paid software. The free and most similar alternative I can now think of is Pixlr[1]. It\u2019s online. I\u2019ve made several edits using that program, including this:   You also have GIMP[2], which you have to download (also for free). Footnotes[1] Photo editor online - Pixlr.com[2] GIMP",
