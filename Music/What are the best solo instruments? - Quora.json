            "answer_text": "In modern pop music it is somewhat, but by no means entirely, traditional for guitar or saxophone to take the lead breaks. I decided it was better to try to think of a instrument that can\u2019t be used for a solo. In the end I decided that they can all be used. Therefore, I think \u201cbest\u201d comes down to two things: the player and the choice of instrument for the song. Take Baker Street for example. Though the history of that famous sax solo is now a little shrouded in mystery and legend, it does appear that Gerry Rafferty composed the part to be sung but also recorded it as a guitar solo. I also remember reading that he tried various instruments for the part, but this may be urban legend! In any case, long story short, Raphael Ravenscroft ended up recording the part with an Alto Saxophone - the rest is history. We learn from this example that making the right choice of instrument MADE the both the solo and the riff. And that solo MADE the song. Rafferty knows how to write hooks and melodies. Raphael knows how to play and coax emotion from his instruments. Look at this Bodhr\u00e1n solo. Such a basic instrument and, perhaps, unlikely to be used solo. Yet it\u2019s mesmerizing, and all down to the player:  You can find many more examples of all kinds of instruments either playing amazing solos within a song or doing their solo \u201cthing\u201d like the Bodhr\u00e1n - even the triangle!! In summary then, I don\u2019t think that there is a best instrument for a solo. Any instrument can be used. However, there is the right instrument and the right player for any given song or context.

            "answer_text": "Think about this: you are going to a concert. There is one person on stage, playing one instrument. What is it? Most likely a piano. He may be singing too, or maybe not. Could be a guitar. or a Violin. It could even be a accordion. Not many others come to mind. A Harp, harpsichord, Lute. A guitar plays the harmony while the singer provides the melody. A Piano plays harmony and melody at the same time, and you can sing along with it. The only other instrument I know of that can do that is the accordion, but it sounds awful compared to a piano. Yes, I have been to concerts with one person on stage playing: Several times it was a Piano. Sometimes it was a guitar. or a Harp, or a Violin, or an accordion. They were all great performances. My opinion is that the best solo instrument is the piano. You can play an astound the audience (Just listen to Horowitz play. Or Elton John, or Steve Green) and sing too if you want to. Just you and the piano. ",
