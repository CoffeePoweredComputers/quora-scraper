            "answer_text": "They\u2019re all my favorites, I just like some more than others. Over a lifetime, it\u2019s important to try everything, because at one (or two) main meal/day, times 365 days per year, multiplied by 40\u201350 years, it allows for many opportunities to try different cuisines. Italian, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Middle-Eastern, Japanese, Eastern European, Mexican, Thai and the broad spectrum of American \u201cfusion\u201d all together make a great base to work from, and that still leaves dozens more to try. Nearly each Caribbean Island has its own specialties. Fish/shellfish, beef, lamb, pork, fowl, wild game, vegetables, fruits, cheeses & dairy can all be prepared in many different manners, there are dozens of types of stews, alone. Throw in burgers, steaks, roasts, sandwiches, pockets, panini and Cuban sandwiches, etc., and it makes for a wonderful base with opportunity to explore & experiment. Traveling helps to expand opportunities to create an even more diverse diet, also - eating is almost as big a part of traveling as is seeing new & beautiful sights. What was my favorite 40 years ago is different from 35 years ago, 30, 20, and so on, so I could even give different answers from day to day. Sometimes, just a charcuterie, antipasto or sashimi plate, and other times a prime rib roast, pork, veal or beef roast or traditional formal meat dish from any nation can be my favorite, at that particular time; other times, a bowl of soup and an appetizer or two can make an exceptional meal. Add different types of breads, rolls, meat-filled baked goods and there are dozens of other options. Think of the hundreds of different cheeses, alone, that are available. Meals of egg dishes provide omelettes, frittatas, quiches and many other varieties of food to enjoy, along with waffles, pancakes, Johnnycakes and many other such foods, too, and then there are dozens of varieties of potatoes alone, not to mention other vegetable main courses, such as stuffed peppers, stuffed zucchini, etc. Plus, soups are extremely varied from country to country, as are noodles and pasta or varieties of rice. I could go on for hours; food is so cool, it\u2019s not just for survival and sustenance, each meal can be a true experience, almost like short trips to exotic places, but a meal doesn\u2019t have to be expensive or elaborate, if well thought-out, and viewed as an experience.
