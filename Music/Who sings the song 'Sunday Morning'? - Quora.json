In order of my best guess on how likely it is to be the one you\u2019re thinking of:-Year, Band, Style, Subject-In 2004, Maroon 5, jazzy pop, something about the rain and lying in bed with somebodyIn 1997, No Doubt, fast ska-ish, about a nasty breakupIn 1966, Velvet Underground, about paranoia\u2026. maybe?? This one has been covered numerous timesin 2007, k-os, percussion heavy rock-hop, I don\u2019t know what this one is about exactly, but it\u2019s super catchyIn 1993, Earth, Wind and Fire, r&b with lots of horns, looking forward to meeting a loverin 2006, Utada Hikaru, but it\u2019s in Japanese, relaxing on the weekend with your ambiguously-not-quite-boyfriendThere\u2019s actually a ton more, but I feel it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re thinking of those, also, I don\u2019t know enough to tell you about them myself.
