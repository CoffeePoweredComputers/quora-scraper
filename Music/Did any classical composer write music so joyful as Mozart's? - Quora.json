            "answer_text": "Using \u201cclassical\u201d in the loose sense of Western art music from Gregorian chant to the present, quite a few. A great deal of English music of the Elizabethan era\u2014madrigals, songs, pieces for broken consort\u2014is extremely lively and joyous, and there are altogether too many composers to single out. Moving forward a bit to the early Baroque, a few that strike me immediately: A hallmark of late 16th century and early 17th century music written in Venice by the Gabrielis and Monteverdi is extraverted joy and exuberance. This strain was carried north of the Alps by Heinrich Schutz (a pupil of Giovanni Gabrieli) and Michael Praetorius, among others, and their work among the joyful music in the Western tradition. The apex of this style is Heinrich Franz Ignatz von Biber\u2019s colossal Missa Salisburgensis, written for the 900th anniversary of Christianity in Salzburg and a heavenly manifestation of the Church Triumphant in C major. In the late 17th and early 18th century, you will find a great deal of joy in Italian composers like Corelli, Vivaldi, and others. Listen, for instance to Corelli\u2019s 12th violin sonata, a set of variations on \u201cLa Follia\u201d, a tune of Spanish origin:  Bach wrote a good deal of joyful music; I\u2019d single out some of the harpsichord concertos, the double choir motets, the Magnificat, and the Christmas Oratorio. The same goes for Handel, in any of the form in which he worked\u2014opera, oratorio, concertos, occasional music like the Water Music, the usic For The Royal Fireworks, or his settings of the Te Deum. Moving to contemporaries of Mozart, the outstanding instance is unquestionably Haydn, who probably wrote more joyful music than any other composer in history. He was blessed with an exceptionally pleasant temperament, and it shines through his music. Listen to any of his last 12 twelve symphonies, or The Creation, or his last six masses, or his Te Deum. I had the good fortune to sing that piece when I was an undergraduate, and it\u2019s a high point in my experience as a choral singer. This is a pretty good performance (not one in which I sang!).  Haydn is undervalued compared with Mozart; I think it pretty clear that in at least one area, choral music, Haydn was a greater master than Mozart. Beethoven? Ninth Symphony. And the Emperor Concerto. Going in the 19th century, I\u2019d single out Camille Saint-Saens. Take a listen to the piano concertos, particularly numbers 2 and 5. I\u2019ll end on one high note: Wagner\u2019s greatest single opera, Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg. The second scene of Act III, from the transition music between scenes one and two to the end, is simply one of the most sublime and joyous things in music. Listen here from about 1:07\u2014that includes the sublime quintet, followed by the transition music, which is every bit as astonishing as that in Parsifal:  ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a beautiful question, joyful music is a miracle by itself. I think that Mozart is the absolute model of joy in music, even though as centuries have gone by, our perspective of Mozart has changed, and we can recognize a very strong and deep composer. I like very much Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi, he is not classical, he is from late renaissance, but he is pure amusement and joy. Look for the Balletti for five voices (per cantare, danzare e sonare). In classical music, I found Haydn to be very joyful. Beethoven has been seen as a powerful composer, but he wrote very joyful movements. I\u2019m thinking about the second movement of the Moonlight Sonata. And Schubert, he was an extremely refined composer. I\u2019m not sure if he is really joyful, but I\u2019ve always got the feeling that he was an angel. ",

In that case, I\u2019d nominate Antonio Vivaldi. Although he belonged to the Baroque era, his best known work came a few years before the \u201cClassical\u201d period, and it has some of the most joyful compositions that I\u2019ve heard. You\u2019ll probably identify it as soon as you hear it, because it is one of the most used pieces of music of classical music to convey joy, happiness, and energy. Just hear the first 5 minutes. \u201cLe Quattro Stagioni\u201d (The Four Seasons)  If you were referring to the Classical period only, or wanted to hear something new, I apologize and would refer you to the other answers, which have been great. ;) ",

But the joyous wins out!  I have many examples and have posted them here before.  Moving on, nearly every great composer of the classical, romantic, impressionist and neo classical period has written much joyous music, too.  I almost categorize Moz as playful and sprightly, and also joyous, especially in his operas. ",
