            "answer_text": "I expect there have been numerous bands that have covered the Clash, but I can\u2019t answer that part of the question. I can however answer the first part: the following is a quick list of songs the Clash covered on record between 1977 and 1980. Of course, it doesn\u2019t count self covers like Jail Guitar Doors\u201d or \u201c1\u20132 Crush on You\u201d or \u201cProtex Blue\u201d (the latter two songs from Mick Jones\u2019 proto-Clash group the London SS, the latter a rewrite of one of Strummer\u2019s 101\u2032ers\u2019 songs, with new lyrics by Jones. Police and Thieves: from their first album, a cover of a reggae song by Junior Murvin (co-written and produced by Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry, who also produced the Clash\u2019s third single \u201cComplete Control.\u201dPressure Drop: another reggae/ska cover, originally by the Maytals, this one is one of their best covers \u2014 it was the B-side to \u201cEnglish Civil War\u201d (I think)I Fought the Law: Originally a huge 1966 hit by Buddy Holly soundalike artist and general badass Bobby Fuller: it came as a bonus single in the USA to Give \u2019Em Enough Rope, it was released on the Cost of Living EP in 1979 in the UK.Brand New Cadillac: a cover of the 1959 rockabilly single by Vince Taylor, it did a good job cleansing the palette with some real primitive rock & roll after the more modern sounding \u201cLondon Calling\u201dWrong \u2019Em Boyo: another reggae cover, originally done by Rulers, this song also quotes from the American folk standard \u201cStagger Lee\". Not sure if the Rulers version does too or not.Revolution Rock: The Clash do reggae again, this one originally done by Danny Ray and the Revolutionaires.Amagideon Time: This was the B-side to \u201cLondon Calling.\u201d It is, surprise surprise, a reggae song. Originally done by Willie WilliamsTime Is Tight: a cover of the Booker T and the MGS song, releaesd on Black Market Clash.Every Little Bit Hurts: A cover of the classic Motown soul song popularized by Brenda Holloway.Junco Partner: a traditional song, one of the better songs on Sandinista!, marred a little by the odd productionLook Here: an jazzy album track off Sandinista!, this one was originally written by jazz artist Mose Allison.Police On My Back: this rockin\u2019 ditty was originally done by reggae artist Eddy Grant, who had a giganto-hit a year or so later with \u201cElectric Avenue.\u201d",
