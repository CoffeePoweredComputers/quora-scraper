            "answer_text": "The recording utilizes a microphone mounted a few feet away from the artist on the boat, visible at 1:46. This picks up vocals, guitar, and foot taps. The guitar is also recorded using the internal electronic pickup system and transmitted using the cable extending out of the end. The internals could be any mix of piezoelectric pickups under the bridge, an internal microphone, and / or internal contact patches to amplify the thumps. The vocals are very likely also recorded using a lavaliere microphone attached to the neck of his sweatshirt. This is how they are able to get those loud vocals with less background noise.  It is also possible they had a fourth microphone pointed away from the artist, for the purpose of picking up background noises. When they want to mix in more background noise they use this signal so that they don't destroy the mix of the other inputs. In the studio they added some reverb to the musical mix to sweeten it. If it were me and I had another track of background noise without vocals as described in the previous paragraph, I would have left the reverb out of the background noise mix to keep it feeling outdoorsy and dry. I'm not sure what they did here. It's all very cleanly done. ",
