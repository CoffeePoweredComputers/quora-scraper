            "answer_text": "Do you mean 3 steps shifted up? I suppose one way to think of Pentatonic Major and Minor is in reference to the Major Scale. Consider the Key of C Major. I won\u2019t get into details here, but if you harmonize the C Major Scale to see what triads come about at each degree/note of the C Major Scale, you will find that you have this: I- Major II - Minor III - Minor IV - Major V- Major VI - Minor VII - Diminished So, for any key, this is how certain riads relate to the degrees of the Major Scale. And it means, you can play a Pentatonic Minor shape starting from any degree/note of the Major Scale that corresponds to a Mainor Triad, and you can play Major Pentatonic from any degree/note of the Major Scale that corresponds to a Major Triad, and doing so will have you playing diatonic to the given key (meaning all notes you play will be in the key). That means you can play C Pentatonic Major, F Pentatonic Major, G Pentatonic Major, as well as D Pentatonic Minor, E Pentatonic Minor, A Pentatonic Minor. The reason this works out is by definition of Pentatonic Minor and Pentatonic Major. We can define Pentatonic Major as having - in relation to Major Scale - the tones root, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th. So if you look at the Major Scale modes that correspond to Major Triads - Ionian, Lydian, Mixolydian - you will notice they all contain - in relation to a Major Scale with same root as the mode (it is sometimes hard to exaplain this in a non-confusing way, but even though I am talking about C Major key, when I talk about these modes I am referencing them to a so-called parallel Major Scale of that mode - meaning Major Scale with same root note as the mode), the tones root, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th. So for C Pentatonic Major, that is C, D, E, G, A. For F Major Pentatonic that is F, G, A, C, D, so on with G Major Pentatonic. Similar deal with those Minor Pentatonic scales. Minor Pentatonic, when referened to a Minor Scale, has tones root, flat 3rd, 4th, 5th, flat 7. If you look at the modes of the major Scale that correspond to Minor triads, you will see that they all contain these tones. That is, Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian, if we define each of them relative to a Minor Scale with same root as the mode, all have tones root, flat 3rd, 4th, 5th, flat 7. So for A Aeolian this would be A, C, D, E, G. That is A Minor Pentatonic. And you will notice likewise for the D and E Minor Pentatonic. Just play the first, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th notes of D Dorian and E Phrygian and you will end up playing D and E Minor Pentatonic. All this can also be understand just by virtue of the relaton to a Major and Minor Scale. That is, a Major Scale that corresponds to a Minor Scale, is always a minor 3rd up. So, with A Minor, that means the relative Major is C Major. Meaning we automaticaly have that A Minor Pentatonic has same notes as C Major Pentatonic D Minor Pentatonic has same notes as F Major Pentatonic E Minor Pentatonic has same notes as G Major Pentatonic That is, one can sort of think of Pentatonic as having modes, such as Minor and Major Pentatonic, where notes are same, just started from different note. Anyway, above are just various equivalent ways to understand what you observed about Major and Minor Pentatonic being a minor third apart. Brian Free Guitar Lessons - Guitar Dreams ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest answer is that the layout of the notes on the neck of a guitar in standard tuning arranges them such that your observation is true. The fingering pattern is as you describe. The better answer requires you to understand the origin of the scales. The notes of the major pentatonic are found by a formula: Root - 2nd - 3rd - 5th - 6th - Octave The notes for the minor pentatonic are also found by a formula: Root - b3 - 4th - 5th - b7th - Octave So lets apply these formulae\u2026 A Maj Pent: \u2026.. A - B - C# - E - F# - A \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026| ..| \u2026|\u2026\u2026.|\u2026.| A Min Pent: A - C - D - E - G - A When you say \u2018shifted 3 steps down\u2019, you are saying \u2018lowered by an interval of a minor third, or a b3\u2019 \u2026 i\u2019ve attempted to draw vertical lines between corresponding notes of these two scale to show you that the relationship of each vertical line is a minor 3rd (3 frets) \u2026 THe A in the A minor Pentatonic scale is a minor 3rd below the C of the A Minor Pentatonic scale, the B is a minor third below the D, The C# is a minor 3rd below the E, etc \u2026.. Your question is analogous to noticing that the notes of A minor pentatonic are the same as the notes of C major pentatonic. So naturally they share the same fingering pattern. Given that A minor is the relative minor to C major, this becomes less surprising. ",
