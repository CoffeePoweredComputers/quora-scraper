            "answer_text": "First of all Aigiri nandini is no song or ranting egoistic bhajans as made in kaliyuga, It is made sung by KaaliDaas, ITS A GREAT STOTRA TO APPEASE MOTHER OF TRINITY MAHADEVI, niether is Tandav such BHAJAN. What you liked in them is great rhythmic words, called chandas, and for that yes there are way many stotras inj Chanda style all our Shastra, for example, Narmadashtakam is quite same as Tandavs Rhythm, Vinddheshwari Stotra also has great chandas, few Stotras or Saraswati like \u201cYa kundendu\u201d, and Mahakalis stotra \u201cSaumyendeevar neel neerad ghata\u201d and i advise purchase Devi Stotras and Shiva Stotra collection, you will find few for sure. I also loved Chanda stotras and stumbled upon many, so read pUrans and look in stotra sangrahs for such great rhythmic stotras and i say, stay away from any hindi bhajan they are but egoistic rants, Gods like Sanskrit its sounds are special, even if you cant understand they have profound affect.
