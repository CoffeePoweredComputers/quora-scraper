            "answer_text": "Not great. As far I remember, the best sample rate is 22kHz (with the 8 bit Arduino). Try the Teensy board instead. It was designed for audio processing and you don\u2019t even have to write code, you can create an effect in 5 minutes with a graphical user interface. Plus you can use it as a USB soundcard! Teensy USB Development Board Feel free to DM me if you have any questions. ",
