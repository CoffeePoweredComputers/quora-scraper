            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. They are the same game made on different platforms. The new bedrock versions of Minecraft can connect together and be played together with people who own different platforms. Xbox to mobile, mobile to PC, and soon Nintendo switch to all of the above. Even so, they are separate distributions, that come from separate online stores, so unfortunately no, you cannot get Minecraft for free on Windows 10 if you bought it on an Android or iOS mobile device. It should be noted, however, any add ons, Maps, or skins you've purchased on mobile are also available on Xbox, PC, and (soon) Nintendo Switch and vice-versa (with some very small exceptions for hevily protected IPs like the Nintendo skins). And just for the record you can't get the old (Java) PC version for free either. The Java version is secluded to PC regardless, and cannot be played with other platforms. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 2 versions of Minecraft: Bedrock edition and Java edition. Java edition is the PC version, while Bedrock is cross platform and is on most of the other devices (except for discontinued ones, like Xbox 360). This is where it gets confusing: There\u2019s another PC version of Minecraft called \u201cWindows 10 Edition\u201d which is also Bedrock. So, if you have Java then it\u2019s a separate account, but if it\u2019s Windows 10 then you can log in with Xbox Live. ",
