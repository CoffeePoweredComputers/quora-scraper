            "answer_text": "On paper MILLIONS. In reality as little as maybe 5k Production companies pad the numbers and are gazillionaires while most indie artists manage on a far less budget. Bands like Paramore did very well but always worked with small independent artists in making their videos so that brought the cost down and made it affordable. With pod casts tech being all the rage, you can buy an entire set of studio equipment for under $1,000 and record in your basement. NOW AS FAR AS VIRAL\u2026 there is MEDIA VIRAL and then there is underground viral and the 2 are world\u2019s apart. MEDIA VIRAL = a return of money to the artists underground viral = MEGA NUMBERS WATCHING THE VIDEOS but few actual dollars I guess in the end it may be said that you get what you pay for, although the most artistic stuff is always the indie productions.
