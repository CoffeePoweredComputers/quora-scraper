            "answer_text": " Kishore Kumar (Abhas Kumar Ganguly). He is the all-time best Indian playback singer. 32 years after his death, his voice still inspires dedicated radio shows [1], concerts & musical nights, remakes and remixes, etc. His voice can be heard on the radio, in the latest remixes, on the television - almost everywhere. While \u201cThe Best\u201d is subjective - for some it might be Md. Rafi, Mukesh, Sonu Nigam, Arijit Singh or Jagjit Singh, Kishore Kumar without doubt is the most popular playback singers of all time. The holy trinity - RD Burman, Kishore Kumar and Rajesh Khanna weaved magic and that music has survived the test of time. [2] Amar Prem, Aap Ki Kasam, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Kati Patang are few of the seemingly endless list of movies that this holy trinity worked together in. Aradhana was credited to SD Burman although RD Burman was involved in the music too!  Kishore Kumar was lucky that he had the maestros like RD Burman, Kalyanji Anandji, etc composing music for him, he was lucky that Anand Bakshi, Indeevar, Sahir Ludhianvi, etc wrote songs for him and he was lucky that superstar Rajesh Khanna was the picturization of his songs. Kishore Kumar sang some good songs in the 80s too but the 80s was actually a horrible era for the Hindi Film Industry as RD Burman, KalyanJi AnandJi, Shankar Jaikishan, etc started fading and the dafli type songs of Laxmikant-Pyarelal started gaining the appeal. The 90s finally bought memorable music back but still the music of the pre-80s era will remain much more popular for a very long time. Music is what soothes you, everyone has their own preference. Kishore Da, Md. Rafi, Mukesh have left behind a treasure of melodies that one can hum at any time of the day. Footnotes[1] Crazy for Kishore with RJ Amit Kumar[2] The unforgettable music Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and RD Burman created together",

            "answer_text": "The question you have asked is a very perspective oriented question. Every person connects to a specific voice and hence rates it higher. This may vary with respect to the genres, time, mode of reproduction etc. But I would be answering this question based on my own understanding of music and intricacies I understand. I would also put forth the best song I have hear from the singer. Ghantasala - Song: Shivashankari (Simply put, for me this is the toughest song composed as of today in film music in India. The song was composed based on the Raag Kannada Durbari, and the reason this is considered as the toughest is because of the gamakas in the song. Sri Ghantasala Garu was a Telugu singer and composer who mostly sang in Telugu and Tamil movies in the Black and White era. Listen to this song to really understand why I say he is the best.)Md Rafi - Song: O duniya ke Rakhwale (If there is any one persong who can claim to be a competition for Ghantasala Garu, then it has to be Md Rafi Saab. The only reason I have kept him second is because he himself had accepted Ghantasala Garu to be the better of them both in a letter he had written to Ghantasala Garu. This was after singing the Raag Durbari - sargam in Baiju Baanvra. The difficulty in the song o duniya ke rakhwale was the octaves through which one has to shift to sing this song along with the scale in which Rafi Saab sung this.Lata Mangeshkar - Song: Lag Ja Gale (This song just reverberates your heart. Frankly I have never been able to get why it is so difficult to sing this song. But believe me, it is. I guess, its because of the poise, balance and breath control required for this melody, which makes it so special. I have never really liked any versions of this song. Although Jonita Gandhi did make a good attempt.)Yesudas - Song: Jab deep jale aana & Sree Raghamo (A Singing powerhouse, he has spent a lot of time in the traditional kacheri live programs. But what ever he has sung in the recording studios has been a league apart. Where he excels in his songs is the expressiveness and clarity to lyrics with the smooth baritone. Infact talking about expressions, you could also listen to Surmai Akhiyoon se.)Kishore Kumar - Song: Ek Chatura Naar (Although a comedy song in itself, singing this song with the variations in it till date proves the mettle of Kishore Da. On a broader note, Kishore Da was what he was because of his versatility. On a day, you could ask him to give Rafi saab\u2019s energy - Mere sapno ki rani kab or Mukesh\u2019s Dard - Mera Jeevan Kora Kagaz or a Roy Rogers with all that yodeling in his songs. His versatality is unmatched in the industry.)There are other great Singers India has Like SP Balasubrahmanyam, Sonu Nigam, Asha Bhonsle, Arijit Singh, Shreya Ghoshal, Kavita Krishnamurty, Manna Dey, Bhupen Hazarika, Shankar Mahadevan, Hans Raj Hans, etc who have been greats in their own domain and provided excellent music in the Film industry. I have only chosen my Top 5. Although I am nothing when compared to their geniuses, I have strictly tried to put forth my perspective. Also I have limited myself to the song sung for movies. Other wise the scope and pool of selection becomes so large that I don\u2019t think I am capable to grade them\u2026 Happy Listening to the songs I mentioned above\u2026..! Take Care and Cheers to life\u2026. Regards, Naveen. ",
