            "answer_text": "Yep. I think it\u2019s once a week online, in addition to the weekly Saturday radio broadcasts. You can also subscribe too their \u201cOn Demand\u201d library and watch their library of recorded performances, both audio and video if available. In fact, they just recently added a performance of Don Giovanni from 1978, with (get this cast) James, Morris, Gabriel Bacquier, Joan Sutherland, Julia Varady, Allan Monk, John MacCurdy and I forget who the other two are. It\u2019s their old production with sets and costumes designed by Eugene Berman, traditional, colorful, with a very young James Morris in the title role. And treats the story with respect, no modernized nonsense, no gratuitous sex scenes, no Nazi uniforms, and a statue that actually walks and talks (or sings), and shakes hands with Giovanni, up close and personal. Now if only they would put up a Faust that is just as good. And why in the world did nobody think to make a video of Turandot with Corelli and Nilsson? ",
