            "answer_text": "You would know better than anyone, or any software, whether your work was plagarized or not, so don\u2019t worry;-) More seriously, no software could really do that, for a couple of reasons. First, and most important, there is no precise legal definition of musical plagarism, and for that reason, you can\u2019t devise a computer program to measure it. Second, musical notation being what it is, you can write the same thing in different ways, so a piece can look different on the page, but sound the same. Anyway, the primary consideration in musical plagarism is the melody, and the old rule of thumb(but not specified in any law) was that it was there had to be two measures or nine consecutive notes that were exactly the same for it to be copied. Also that chord progressions are not copyright protected. There is a really good article here, and rather than plagarizing from it, I\u2019ll just post the link(which is easier that cutting and pasting, anyway) Plagiarism or inspiration? ",

            "answer_text": "Odds are, at least 98% of your music is certainly plagiarized. Let me explain: You did not invent or construct the instruments you are using. You did not invent the tones and scales that are commonly used in Western music composition, nor did you invent an entirely new way of organizing them. You did not invent the rhythmic patterns you are using, most of which are indescribably ancient. Whatever mode of discourse and formal organization your music employs did not in all likelihood originate with you. You probably did not invent the genre you are working within (chamber music, symphonic, vocal etc) As you write, your memory is drawing upon and reordering a vast ocean of earlier music that you have absorbed consciously or unconsciously simply as a result of being alive. None of this stems from you, although you are the filter and the conduit that is bringing this music together in a particular way. Embrace your unoriginality. Plagiarize everything, but do it intelligently. ",

(When you see the song below, you'll see what I mean!) So I sang It into SoundHound App on my iPhone. It immediately identified it. I just did it right now with the same song and the song it was came up as the top choice.  So you can do that and see how close you are to something else. I think it has to follow a certain number of successive notes before it's copyright infringement. I'm not sure, but I think it's 7. It won't matter until you make lots of money from the song. (-: ",
