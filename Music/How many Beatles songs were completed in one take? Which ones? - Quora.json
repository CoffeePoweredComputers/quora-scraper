            "answer_text": "***REVISED*** - April 12, 2020 In their recording career, The Beatles completed FOUR songs in one take and none of them was \u201cTwist and Shout.\u201d I am forced to revise this answer because I errored. My source for the recording information is Mark Lewisohn\u2019s book entitled \u201cThe Complete Beatles Recording Sessions.\u201d Lewisohn is one of the leading authorities on Beatles recordings. He has a stellar rep. My problem was that I didn\u2019t read his book more carefully the first time around. I have re-read the book and now I think I have the information correct. I am indebted to David McKay and Mitchell Martin for pointing out my mistakes. The Beatles recorded FOUR songs in one take. Interestingly enough, there was one song sung by each Beatle. They are as follows: On Monday, Feb. 11, 1963, Ringo took lead vocals for the first time in the studio on the Shirelles\u2019 \u201cBoys,\u201d written by Luther Dixon and Wes Farrell. Ringo played the drums and sang and the song was recorded in one take. That was the day the Beatles recorded 10 songs in a marathon session for the first album \u201cPlease Please Me,\u201d which was released on March 22, 1963.On Sunday, March 1, 1964, Paul did his greatest ever Little Richard impression on Little Richard\u2019s \u201cLong Tall Sally.\u201d George Martin joined the four Beatles on piano and the five did a near-perfect rendition of \u201cLong Tall Sally.\u201d They didn\u2019t bother with a second take. The song appeared on a 4-song EP released June 1, 1964, that included \u201cMatchbox,\u201d \u201cI Call Your Name\u201d and \u201cSlow Down.\u201dOn Sunday, Oct. 18, 1964, the Beatles had a very productive recording session of songs for their 4th album in 21 months, \u201cBeatles For Sale.\u201d At one point they completed three songs in 5 takes. George sang the lead on a cover version of the Carl Perkins song \u201cEverybody\u2019s Trying To Be My Baby.\u201d There was an incredible amount of echo on George\u2019s voice, but the take was well done and another take wasn\u2019t taken.The next song that day was John singing Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll Music.\u201d The four Beatles were joined by George Martin playing the piano. Martin did a fine job, complete with several Glissandi (slides on the keys). The group did one take, it was crisp and clean. No other takes were made. \u201cRock and Roll Music\u201d and \u201cEverybody\u2019s Trying to Be My Baby\u201d both appeared on \u201cBeatles For Sale,\u201d released on Dec. 4, 1964.What are some of the lessons that can be gleaned from these facts? First, all the songs done in one take were songs they had played in their Hamburg days. They were used to playing them \u201clive.\u201d Granted, Ringo had not been in Hamburg, but Pete Best had sung \u201cBoys\u201d with the Beatles in Hamburg and Ringo had actually sung \u201cBoys\u201d with his previous band. Second, all the one-take songs were in the Rock and Roll or Rockabilly vein. Those kind of songs sound more exciting and authentic if they\u2019re a little raw and unpolished, so why do a lot of takes? Third, all the one-take songs were cover songs. Had they been Lennon and McCartney songs, I think they may have done a number of takes. Songwriters want to present their own songs in the best light possible. The more polish the better. During that marathon session of Feb. 11, 1963, the Beatles did 12 takes of \u201cI Saw Her Standing There,\u201d 8 of \u201cDo You Want to Know a Secret,\u201d 17 of \u201cThere\u2019s a Place,\u201d and 16 of \u201cMisery.\u201d In the sessions for their second album, \u201cWith the Beatles,\u201d which were on July 18, July 30, and Sept. 11\u201312, 1963, they took 23 takes of \u201cIt Won\u2019t Be Long,\u201d, 13 of \u201cAll My Loving,\u201d 15 of \u201cAll I\u2019ve Got To Do,\u201d 9 of \u201cNot A Second Time,\u201d 16 of \u201cHold Me Tight,\u201d 19 of \u201cDon\u2019t Bother Me,\u201d18 of \u201cLittle Child,\u201d and \u201c7 of \u201cI Wanna Be Your Man.\u201d The point of relating all this is that from the beginning, the Beatles worked very diligently in the studio. Early in their career, they may have tried to be efficient in the studio. But after \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band,\u201d I don\u2019t think that they cared at all how much time they spent in the studio. It wasn\u2019t unusual for them to do 30 or more takes of songs. For example, on the White Album, McCartney got Lennon and Harrison to sit for 67 straight takes of \u201cI Will.\u201d Now, \u201cI Will\u201d is a lovely little tune, but 67 takes? But then, Lennon took 112 takes of \u201cSexy Sadie\u201d and Harrison did 67 takes of \u201cLong Long Long.\u201d The Beatles became less efficient and more time-consuming in their recording efforts later in their career. Ultimately, it\u2019s a myth that the Beatles routinely recorded songs in one take. It happened FOUR times in their entire career. ",

            "answer_text": "The early ones. But can I just say, it does not matter? The Rolling Stones, famously, throw up a few room mics, muck about a bit, playing together as a band, and the engineer presses record when he thinks they are about there. And that is a *brilliant* technique, which delivered some all-time classic tracks. But the Beatles were different (after the first couple of albums). They realised, rightly, that the recording studio is an additional instrument. That if you mess about with it enough, you can produce new and interesting sounds. That you can do multiple takes of your own voices singing different harmonies, that no live take can replicate. This is why they stopped touring (combined with the lack of adequate live sound equipment, which meant nobody could hear them). So they became possibly the definitive \u201cstudio band\u201d instead, at least until others like Pink Floyd, 10cc and Queen came along. It is a different way of working. But to deny the role of \u201cthe studio\u201d as an additional band member is very short-sighted. I am a proud owner of \u201cRecording the Beatles\u201d and also, even more rarely, a copy of a 1960s history of EMI given to me by Albert Lee during a session.
