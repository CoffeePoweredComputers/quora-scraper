            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! I'm sorry but I'm going to not answer the question asked at all! For me Strange Days is The Doors' artistic masterpiece. Sure there's other great albums, other albums that have more memorable songs. But for me, Strange Days is The Doors, actually being The Doors! (sic) Let me try to explain... The Doors get called many things: acid rock, erotic politicians, head music etc. They are often commented on as the anti-flower power band, the band that explored darkness. For me Strange Days is the only album where they nearly* achieve this 100% The songs on Strange Days are strange (!) they're eerie, they have a disenchanted vibe to them. This is a band in their prime; commercially successful, studio savvy and full of confidence. Morrison's voice is at it's peak, powerful and with it's trade mark honeyed purr The arrangements are tight. The compositions have been honed during two plus years of gigs, from tiny venues to large ones. There's no real pop sound here, Strange Days is The Doors at their darkest... this album is about the uneven streets, the lost little girl, the face in the mirror that won't stop, the ravaged earth, the strange night of stone, about going to drown tonight in a stiff green gallop. Strange Days (to me at least) is The Doors confronting the abyss. So which is my favourite song? Well I love them all, but IMHO more importantly Strange Days is the most artistically coherent body of work (in a single album) The Doors ever laid down. The songs each work standalone, but more importantly they form an album that's greater than the sum of it's constituent parts with a unified theme. *Except one track. Love Me Two Times, which although couldn't ever be described as a happy little ditty has always (to me at least) been a bit of a sore thumb on the Strange Days track listing. A GREAT song (don't get me wrong), but slightly at odds sound wise with the rest of the album... Just not quite.. well... strange enough to be on Strange Days So my answer to \"which is my favourite song on Strange Days\" Any song except Love Me Two Times. (Told you I wouldn't answer the question!) ",

            "answer_text": "Strange Days. 'Strange days have found us...' Jim Morrison sings, his voice processed through a moog to create a submerged and hazy quality. I believe the song is about a party where people have taken LSD for the first time and the trip is not a pleasant one. The 'strange days' are like some sort of unfriendly spirits that have invaded the lives of regular people who used to experience 'casual joy' without any truly insidious effects, other than maybe a hangover. The hostess of the party seems to be enjoying the state that her guests are in, but the guests are really freaked out. Eventually, they cannot take it anymore and burst out of the house into the night, only to find that everything is motionless, like stone. That will teach you! Musically, I love the organ and the bass lines, especially after the second verse. These do sound like strange days, indeed! (most peculiar, mama, whoa! - JL) ",
