As stated, this question could be referring to any of a thousand different songs, so I\u2019ll throw my hat in and hope for the best. When I read your question, the first song I thought of is \u2018Magic\u2019 by Scottish rock band Pilot. The \u2018oh oh oh\u2019 in this song is at the beginning rather than the end of the chorus, and was released in 1974 rather than the 80s, but otherwise if it\u2019s not the song you\u2019re looking for, you should listen to it anyway because it\u2019s wonderful.
