            "answer_text": "Well here in Scandinavia ALL of the indie bands are going with Fender Jazzmasters - they've got that thin clean surfy sound but also have the bottom end when distorted that Strats or Telecasters don't have. they look cool too. that's important.   yeah though - go get some trashy vintage guitar from somewhwere in asia if you just wanna look cool, but like anything old and shitty - they will be in need of repair all the time if you wanna put it to work. you need something you can depend on if you're serious.  I think every indie musician needs a Danelectro at some point in their life - they are affordable, sound cool, look retro and do the job. the build quality on some of the models is a bit iffy - but the newer ones are pretty solid.  I play a Hofner Galaxy II. it's a re-issue of the classic 60s Hofner guitars. it is my main guitar - has a really interesting sound from the stock Mini-humbuckers, great action, solid electronics and it was CHEAP. check one of those out and see if it's to your liking.

            "answer_text": "There is no one best type, but the best choice for you is one that A) is similar in sound to that of other indie guitarists/bands that you like, and B) (and this is a universal thing with guitars) feels most comfortable in your hands, like say if your eyes were closed. Some indie guitarists play clean and you can hear more tonal differences between different kinds of guitars \u2014 solid body, hollow body, single-coil pickups or humbuckers \u2014 and others play with lots of distortion and effects pedals and the guitar\u2019s sound becomes less important. So find out what guitars (and amps, and effects) the guitarists whose sound you might want to emulate use and you can\u2019t really go wrong, unless a guitar just doesn\u2019t feel comfortable as you\u2019re playing it.
