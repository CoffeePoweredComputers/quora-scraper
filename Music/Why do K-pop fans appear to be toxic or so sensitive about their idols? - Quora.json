            "answer_text": "Some fans take the term 'idol' too literally to the point where they literally see them as Gods. This is probably because the Kpop industry is known for trying to shape the celebrities to be perfect and without flaw. Within the Kpop fandom, members are rarely ever criticised but praised for everything. So when people do start criticising the members (even if it is not rude and may be valid) they automatically coin the comment as negative and get defensive over the idols they 'worship'. Furthermore, many kpop fans have a relationship with the idols stronger than the relationships western artists have with their fans. For example, kpop idols reveal alot more to their fans on social media, we see them on reality TV shows, variety shows, almost everyday on social media. We see videos of them sleeping, eating, we know the relationships they have with people, we even know what fabric softener they use . It's almost as if the fan has a personal relationship with the idol. This causes them to be much more defensive about the idol. Sometimes over the top defensive . But this is only a small few of kpop fans which are delulu . Most of us are completely normal and can accept criticism  ( I think I can anyway loool) ",

            "answer_text": "Some of them are very delusional. To the point where they see their idols as their \u201chusbands\u201d, when in reality none of their idols even know them (unless they\u2019ve been to a fanmeeting of some sort and have met them) or even truly care about them individually. I\u2019m a bit blunt there, but that is actually the truth. Or maybe some (matured) fans just don\u2019t like seeing their idols receiving hate or discrimination from other people, and just honestly want to defend them against people who says false information about their idols. It just depends on which type of situation it is, really. I\u2019m actually a kpop fan myself. ",
