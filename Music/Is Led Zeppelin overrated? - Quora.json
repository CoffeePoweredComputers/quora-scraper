            "answer_text": "Things are of their time. If you listen to the top 100 from any point in the 1960s, there will be perhaps a few songs you recognise, on their way up or on their way down, but most of them will by now be forgotten, and if you listen to them, they will have a distinct naivity or roughness which means you won\u2019t be adding them to your Spotify playlist.[1] The same goes for the 70s, and 80s. There are a very few musicians and bands which transcend their time. The Beatles is pre-eminent in this select group, but Led Zeppelin is a close second. In fact, the sound of Zeppelin stands up better than the sound of the Beatles, although the Beatles had many more memorable songs which have not musically or lyrically aged at all. Led Zeppelin went out of fashion somewhat in the 80s and 90s. Frequently tongue in cheek, or simply fooling around, their lyrics were perceived as not serious enough for the self-important fin-de-si\u00e8cle. Now that the world has got its sense of humour back, and partly spurred on by Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings revival, people are happy enough to listen to a song misrepresenting Gollum, without requiring that it mean anything. Even the much maligned and over-interpreted Stairway to Heaven lyrics can now be interpreted\u2014as they deserve to be\u2014as a series of nostalgic-romantic vignettes creating a powerful, if diffuse, impression, rather than an attempt to start a new religion or influence impressionable teens who had mastered the implausible skill of listening to records backwards. Listened to today, the sounds are as raw and live as they ever were, and the organic movement and occasional 5/4 bar contrast attractively with the click-track-controlled and ProTools/Logic-edited creations pumped out from sterile music laboratories and made available online without ever passing through the ears of a live audience. Led Zeppelin also score heavily in the way in which they developed from album to album. Led Zeppelin (I) introduced the new genre of riffing heavy metal. Led Zeppelin II took riffing to new heights, but also introduced folk elements into what was otherwise just overdriven blues. Led Zeppelin III took the band in an entirely different direction, largely acoustic, but seamlessly blending the folk, rock and blues elements. It also had one of the most creative covers in rock. (IV) is rightly regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time. This is not really because of the stand-out track Stairway to Heaven. Many albums had a standout track, albeit not on the same scale. (IV) was a gem from beginning to end, showcasing the band\u2019s varied talents from Rock and Roll all the way through to the When the Levee Breaks. Houses of the Holy was musically diverse. Not everyone got the corny joke of the reggae track, but it is hard to fault the lyrical art of The Rain Song. Physical Graffiti is regarded by many Zeppelin fans as the culmination. It was orchestral in scope, but Zeppelin never cheated by bringing in armies of backing musicians to achieve it. Presence returned to the after-midnight blues from before Zeppelin began. The cover never really worked for me, but everything else about the album remains fresh. In Through the Out Door, with another highly creative cover, diversified into more musical genres than it had songs. The live album, The Song Remains the Same is unlike most other live albums. Although it does contain some loose playing, it also captures rawness and energy, especially on the extended guitar solo Dazed and Confused, which is rarely found anywhere. Coda spoke more about what had been consciously kept off the other albums. It was more serious, and ethnomusicological, than the others, and it had a much more serious album cover. It revealed the craftsmanship of Zeppelin. Since then, there have been numerous releases of previously unheard material, and this has served to strengthen Zeppelin\u2019s reputation. During the \u201880s, the band was often accused of having been loose and poorly rehearsed on stage\u2014a renarration on the back of their Live Aid appearance, though, of course, this was without John Bonham and was years after the band had split up. The newly released material shows just how tight they were.  I listened to Zeppelin incessantly until I was 18, and then didn\u2019t have access to their recordings (no record player) until I was 26. By that point, we were deep into the thrash and shred era, where everything had to be faster than everything else, and even teenagers could play Steve Vai solos. Maverick players, and maverick bands, were going out of fashion. Here at the end of the second decade of the 21st century, forty years after the band finished, Zeppelin is getting more attention than ever. It has, quite simply, not aged.  ~~~  What follows was a response to a comment, which was essentially \u2018what do you mean songs from 60s are forgotten?\u2019 Here\u2019s a look at the UK charts from this week, in 1966. If you wonder why UK, then, very simply, Led Zeppelin was a UK band. Getaway, by Georgie Flame and the Blue Flames, was UK #1 on 21 July 1966. Official Singles Chart Top 50 I picked the date at random, as being the chart of this week in the year of my birth. Number 2 was Sunny Afternoon by the Kinks. I remember the Kinks, couldn\u2019t tell you anything about Sunny Afternoon. Out of Time by Chris Farlowe was #3. Then we get Ike and Tina with River Deep, Mountain High. I don\u2019t think I know that one. #4 is Nobody Needs Your Love by Gene Pitney, followed by Black is Black by Los Bravos, then I couldn\u2019t live without your love, by Petula Clark, Bus stop by the Hollies, Love Letters, Elvis Presley, With a girl like you by the Troggs, and then Strangers in the Night, by Frank Sinatra, which I do recognise. Then we get Going back by Dusty Springfield, The more I see you, by Chris Montez, and The Beatles with Paperback Writer, which I vaguely recognise. Hideaway by Dave Dee is followed by Lana, from Roy Orbison. I think I\u2019ve heard that one, Don\u2019t answer me by Cilla Black, Mama by Dave Berry, and then a better known song, When a man loves a woman by Percy Sledge. Then we get Monday Monday by the Mamas and the Papas, (Baby) You don\u2019t have to tell me by the Walker Brothers, and at number 22 James Brown with It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World, which still gets airplay today. These are the top 22, not the top 100. Now, you may have an exceptionally good memory for songs from that chart, but, apart from Strangers in the Night and It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World, I would argue that none of those songs would spring to mind (except the Beatles, because they were the Beatles) if you asked people to name fifty hits from the 60s. Of course, if you played them at a nostalgia night, or as part of the sound track of a film, there would be people who got the vibe and recognised them, but they are, by most people, most radio stations and most DJs, forgotten.\u2018Forgotten\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018it never happened and if you say it did I will deny it\u2019, it means things that aren\u2019t in people\u2019s active memory now. If you play someone a song they have forgotten, they may say \u2018thank you \u2014 I\u2019d forgotten that song \u2014 it reminds me of my childhood\u2019. They won\u2019t say \u2018I deny that song ever happened\u2019.Back to the #1, Getaway. I would argue that this is a very good example of a song which is \u2018of its time\u2019. It does not have the present immediacy of Black Dog. No disrespect to Georgie Flame, who had a #1 record, which most of us have never done, but it does not have the longevity of Led Zeppelin.

            "answer_text": "I was a huge fan of Led Zeppelin by the time I was 16. The more I got into Zep the more I tried to read bios and stuff on the members. Some of it was a little disturbing, in terms of their attitudes and egos, and just stupid crap they did when not on stage. Much later I heard MANY accusations of plagiarism by them. Quite a few have been proven to be true. That\u2019s a bummer. Plus, I didn\u2019t look at liner notes closely to notice how many of their songs were written by blues giants from years before. That was a let-down to me too. So, are they overrated? I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re rated, and by what rating system they use. As far as I know, Rolling Stone magazine spent the first decade of their existence trashing them, and then the next couple of decades interviewing the surviving band members any chance they could get. So in a way, they were very UNDERRATED by a lot of music critics. Underrated compared to their popularity. As far as the fans, they love Zep because they love Zep. Do they love the band too much? Is it too much for others? Does it even matter? If people really love the music, that\u2019s what matters to me. And I do. I have no problem with them getting sued by people they have plagiarized, and I don\u2019t mind people highly critical of their antics. They were poster children for the stereotype of rock star: too much booze and drugs, sex with groupies all the time, and trashing hotel rooms all the time. I don\u2019t justify any of that, and people can hate them for doing what so many bands after, and at least a few before, did. But the music\u2026it still moves me. Are the guys geniuses? I have no idea. Are they, by some objective scale, particularly good instrument players? I wouldn\u2019t know that either. I\u2019m pretty sure Robert Plant\u2019s singing is amazing, but then, what do I know about singing? All I know is that for once I had a band I could call my own. I have loved them for almost thirty years now, and probably will until the end of my life. If they\u2019re not your thing, they\u2019re not your thing. Shakespeare was never my thing, and I thought he was overrated. I was wrong, but I thought that. I was wrong because much of what I didn\u2019t like about Shakespeare was the ludicrous predictability of his plots, and his tendency to use cliches. The problem was, I neglected to account for just how much Shakespeare invented or at least defined some of those plots, and coined the phrases I thought were cliche. I think some of that is true for Zep as well. They may not seem to stand out as much now that it\u2019s almost 50 years since they started. But a lot of that has to do with just how much they influenced hard rock and even heavy metal. Credit is due to the blues giants who inspired Zep, and especially to those blues giants who wrote the songs that Zep performed. But as much as I admire hearing the original, \u201cWhen the Levee Breaks,\u201d I still prefer Zep\u2019s rendition. To be honest, I probably never would have gone back to listen to Leadbelly, Robert Johnson, and so many other blues greats if I hadn\u2019t heard Led Zeppelin and their contemporaries playing their own interpretations.
