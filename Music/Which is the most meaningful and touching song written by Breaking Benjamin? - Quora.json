            "answer_text": "You should check out the albums Phobia and Dear Agony. Those albums have the deepest and most meaningful songs in my opinion. The actual meaning of the songs vary from listener to listener. Ben himself stated in multiple interviews that the he writes the songs so they can be interpreted in multiple ways, so there truly isn't just one interpretation. That\u2019s one of the most beautiful aspects of their songs in my opinion. My personal recommendations would be, Breath, You, Dear agony, Give me a sign, Dance with the devil, Evil angel, Unknown soldier, Forever, So cold, Anthem of the angels, Ashes of eden. ",

            "answer_text": "Breaking Benjamin has always produced songs with a deep meaning. My favourite would be Dance with the Devil \\U0001f47f. Apart from its terrific rock, it speaks about a closed or loved one going through a problem and how Benjamin wants to help him. Another interpretation is that song speaks about Benjamin 's various phobias. He has gone on record saying that he wants to put of Death for as long as possible. So here he overcomes his fears and dances with the Devil ",
