            "answer_text": "I think that I\u2019m like a lot of people, in that I never learned how to dance mostly due to there having been so few opportunities to do so. Dancing is something rarely done in today\u2019s day and age. Think about it: when was the last time that dancing was called for in your day to day life, or even an option? At a friend\u2019s wedding years ago? Even earlier? High school prom? Dancing for most people is like wearing a tuxedo: it\u2019s something that is only called for, or even comes up, a handful of times in the average person\u2019s life. It\u2019s entirely possible to go from cradle to grave without ever taking a single dance step, not out of avoidance or dislike, but simply due to the circumstances never arising. I regard dancing the same way I regard equestrianism: a noble, demanding, but ultimately dead art that\u2019s carried on only by a few enthusiasts, hobbyists, and specialists. Whether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t say since I have nothing to compare it to, but I imagine that it\u2019s good that a few people are keeping the tradition alive for the sake of posterity, if nothing else.

            "answer_text": "My girlfriend loves dancing, but I hate it. In our first two or three dates, I pretended to like it, but it came to a point where I couldn\u00b4t pretend anymore. I just don\u00b4t see the appeal. I don\u00b4t know what liking a certain song has to do with flailing your body around. It feels awkward and forced. Sometimes I wish I could enjoy it, but, as far as I\u00b4m concerned, dancing is just a mating ritual to work around the taboo of asking explicitly for sex. ",
