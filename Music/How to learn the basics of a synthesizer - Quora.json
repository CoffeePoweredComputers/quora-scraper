            "answer_text": "perspective 1: [you already play the musical keyboard well and want to experiment with sound]    your keyboard skills will carry over to the synthesizer as most synthesizers use the keyboard interface. so now you'll have to do some reading about what synths do. the basic concept is the oscillator, of course. the pure sine wave is what it starts with, and then as you add (or subtract or invert) waves you end up with a certain waveform: you can actually plot amplitude vs time and see the wave. what you see is what you hear.    it's basically creating your own instrument, so you'll have to have a sound understanding of frequency, attack, timbre and tuning (temperament). sound engineers will be able to shed more light on how to change those aspects to create your own virtual instrument.    when you start experimenting most of what you create will sound rather artificial, or \"cold\", as compared to real world instruments thanks to harmonics. real instruments generate vibrations with harmonics extending upto 20KHz and beyond, and they have a certain randomness to them (you cannot produce the same sound twice). but this level of control is generally not available on the low/mid range keyboards in the market, unless you are lucky enough to get a second hand minimoog. (king korg, korg krome, korg kronos, roland jupiter allow you a lot of freedom in this regard, though they are very pricey).    at this point if you don't want to spend money on something which is just a hobby, you could plug your keyboard into a comp (midi/usb) and start using qsynth or zynaddsubfx. it is unbelievable what you can do with these software synthesizers. zynaddsubfx even has a randomizer which allows you create truly realistic sounds. of course you'll have to spend quite a lot of time reading the zynaddsubfx manual. bonus point is you can import *.scl files with alternate tunings and experiment with raagas, historical and exotic tunings. this is the part that truly fascinates me. some links:http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/#featureshttp://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/http://xen-arts.net/zynaddsubfx-microtuning-features-updated/ perspective 2: [you are just getting started with \"keyboard\"]    if you're just getting started and have bought yourself a yamaha/casio/roland keyboard, then mostly you would want to first develop your keyboard skills for which there are numerous tutorials on youtube, or you could attend keyboard classes. or maybe if you are lucky enough to have a korg/roland/nord as your first keyboard then you can try to do everything at once: synthesize your own sounds and play them. but your focus would have to be music and possibly ear training.
