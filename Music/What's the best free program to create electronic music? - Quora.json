            "answer_text": "Honestly, if you\u2019re going to be producing electronic music, I would just stick with whatever\u2019s the most popular/used paid DAW and see if there\u2019s a free trial or demo you can mess around with. These are, but not limited to: Ableton, Fruity Loops (FL), Logic, Cubase. The problem with all the free software is that while they are decent, there are a lot of factors you probably haven\u2019t considered yet if you decide to use them. Let me walk you through my logic. If you\u2019re doing this just for fun, using a free program might be perfect for right now. But let\u2019s say you do this for a few months, discover you like it a lot more than you realized, and keep going at it. You\u2019re going to hit a ceiling pretty fast in terms of functionality and features offered in a free software vs. a paid one. At least with a demo/trial version of software like Ableton, for example, upgrading won\u2019t require you to re-learn new software/interfaces. You\u2019ve already been using it for a while so you simply keep on going with no interruption. If you don\u2019t want to pay, then you can always pirate the software.The companies that support the most popular paid DAWs like Ableton and FL are constantly developing new features and updates for them. They fix community-voiced issues, bugs, and add new toys that you can play with in the software, because they, as a business, are incentivized to continually improve their flagship products. Free programs, once they are released, not as much, and definitely not on the same scale.The community support behind free programs are probably extremely limited. This is a big one! Unless you\u2019re paying a couple thousand bucks to go to a school specializing in music production, you\u2019re going to be learn 99% of your craft on the Internet. Do me a favor right now: Go on Youtube and see how many tutorials there exist for programs like Ableton or FL and then go check out how many exist for the free ones. One of the fastest ways of getting better is through learning from your peers. These will be your teachers. You\u2019ll find the best are (usually) paying for their software and trying to stay on top of what their favorite producers/role models are doing in the industry right now. You want to learn from the best. That\u2019s the fastest way to get better.Again, you can always pirate your software. People will try to chastise you for it, but hey, if you\u2019re doing this for purely fun, and not trying to make money off of it, then what\u2019s the harm? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if your exact knowledge of what specifically the poster is eluding to in his question. BandLab is actually what was formally Cakewalk Sonar\u2019s highest offered product. Which is fully downloadable as it was when it was a quite expensive and very revered and specifically well running and very stable professional DAW on the windows platform. Everything offered now for free includes all but a handful of plugins which were third party plugins (mainly a few instruments) which had prior agreements which dissolved with Cakewalk and its paid version. While somewhat of a complicated story essentially Gibson has purchased Cakewalk a few years ago and during the restructuring after they went bankrupt they essentially abandoned the DAW and all the additional software with it. Nearly all the original staff especially the development & creative staff from cakewalk were still working for Cakewalk and decided to stay and offer the product for free and renamed it BandLab. They went on to develop a multi platform very well developed and fully interchangeably compatible mobile platform production App that works seamlessly with the desktop DAW with a very close but entirely optional interaction with the mobile App which allows users to engage in social creation of music in a unique and very interactive experience. Furthermore, they are actually probably next to the or perhaps even better then Reaper in terms of customer support and fixing to resolution problems their users encounter - odder still they are even more responsive more rapid and helpful then when their customers actually paid for the software. I have no idea exactly how they are doing this and making this model work particularly as I literally work on a quite different team in my job\u2026 however it\u2019s really a remarkable experience and very well developed and solid code. As a DAW I would absolutely recommend and personally use it over many other quite expensive DAWs on the market. ",
