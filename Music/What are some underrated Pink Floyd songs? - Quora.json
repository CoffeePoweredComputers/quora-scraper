            "answer_text": "A lot of Roger Waters-sung ballads are criminally under-rated. I can never quite get why people dislike Waters\u2019 voice or do not think of him on the same level as that of Gilmour. So what if it was more cynical and distinctly English rather than the smooth feel of Gilmour? Waters could play with his voice in ways that most singers can never dream of. He is, in my opinion, up there with Dylan, Lennon and Bowie. Anyway, to answer your question, here are some of the most underrated Floyd songs\u2026 1- Let There Be More Light (A Saucerful Of Secrets) Waters\u2019 bass solo in the opening is one of the finest examples of his skills. I have read somewhere on Quora that Waters was an average bass player. I disagree. This song, along with his deft bass work in \u2018The Dark Side Of The Moon\u2019 and \u2018Animals\u2019, proves that he was one hell of an underrated musician. Other than that, the sound of the whole song is genuinely edgy and intriguing. I loved the way how Wright and Waters blended their refrains so seamlessly to sound like one- you can hear only slight whispers of Waters\u2019 voice- and I love Gilmour\u2019s rockstar-like roar in the choruses. 2- San Tropez (Meddle) Ask all the \u2018Meddle\u2019 fans to name their favorites and the expected answer can be either \u2018Fearless\u2019 or the epic \u2018Echoes\u2019. Try out \u2018San Tropez\u2019, folks. It is clearly one of the band\u2019s most effortlessly beautiful, wistful and romantic numbers of all time. The tinkling piano, the leisurely strumming of the guitar, the sun-kissed and languid wordplay, and above all, Waters\u2019 wistful voice help to create a stunning, timeless number. All those who think that Waters was good only with serious, cynical rock, will think again after listening to this. 3- Any Colour You Like (The Dark Side Of The Moon) Easily, the best, purely instrumental track from the album (excepting \u2018The Great Gig In The Sky\u2019, which is not really instrumental). Sure, Waters did not have any hand in composing it; it was rather a work of Gilmour, Wright and Mason and really extraordinary at that. The song has an addictive, slow-paced and melancholic feel to it and Waters does pop up again with some stellar bass playing in the backdrop. 4- Pigs (Three Different Ones) (Animals) Waters\u2019 angriest, most acidic song ever. The lyrics burst with biting scorn and sarcasm, the references to real-life bigwigs are punchy, Gilmour\u2019s snarling, buzzing guitar is terrific and Waters\u2019 sneering voice is here at its best, perfectly suiting the bitter barrage of abuse at the eponymous \u2018pigs\u2019. 5- Mother (The Wall) Yet another perfect example of the Waters-Gilmour contrast next to the stunning \u2018Comfortably Numb\u2019. Waters sings with profound pain his lines of doubt and dismay, as the tortured son asking his mother for protection against the cruel world around him. Gilmour sings as the mother, protective and domineering. The distinctive features of their respective voices blend in beautifully to create a truly sad ballad and that guitar solo is clearly one of Gilmour\u2019s finest. 6- Don\u2019t Leave Me Now (The Wall) The sheer, heartbreaking pain of this song is frankly unbearable. What is even more devastating is Waters\u2019 lyrics- turning a typical song of separation into a bitter and scathing portrait of a disastrous, nightmarish marriage. His voice here is heartbreaking too. And yet it is all beautiful. Trust Floyd to make even the worst things in life come out as vivid and spectacular. ",

            "answer_text": "Summer \u201868 (From Atom Heart Mother) This is one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs, and my favorite Pink Floyd song that\u2019s written/sung by Richard Wright. I\u2019ve been literally obsessed with this song lately. Best song from the album, in my opinion. Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun (From A Saucerful of Secrets) This is another amazing Pink Floyd song that gets literally no attention. It gives me a\u2026 it\u2019s honestly hard to describe it. I wanna say Egyptian vibe. It\u2019s literally my favorite Pink Floyd song right now. Another great song from Roger. Learning to Fly (From A Momentary Lapse of Reason) A Momentary Lapse of Reason is an album I\u2019ve only listened to recently. Sure, it\u2019s not the same without Roger, but David still does a great job without him. \u201cLearning to Fly\u201d is one of the highlights of the album for me. What Do You Want From Me (From The Division Bell) I wanted to say High Hopes. Really I did. But that song gets a lot of attention imo. Another really good song from Division Bell is \u201cWhat Do You Want From Me.\u201d Shine On You Crazy Diamond Parts 6\u20139 (From Wish You Were Here) Parts 1\u20135 get the most attention, but in my opinion, Parts 6\u20139 are better by miles. Sysyphus (From Ummagumma) A great Richard Wright song from Pink Floyd\u2019s most underrated album. Rick Wright, in my opinion, is the underdog of Pink Floyd. Not Now John (From The Final Cut) The Final Cut is another severely underrated Roger Wat- uhh, Pink Floyd album. Not Now John, along with The Fletcher Memorial Home, really deserve some recognition. Goodbye Blue Sky (From The Wall) Goodbye Blue Sky is my favorite from The Wall. Unfortunately, it gets overlooked because of Another Brick in the Wall and Comfortably Numb. Breathe (In The Air) [From Dark Side of the Moon] Breathe is another really good song that sadly gets overlooked by Dark Side\u2019s other songs, such as Money and Us and Them. On the Turning Away (From A Momentary Lapse of Reason) One of the best songs from the album. Really good. ",
