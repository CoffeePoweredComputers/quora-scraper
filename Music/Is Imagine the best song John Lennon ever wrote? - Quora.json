            "answer_text": "In my opinion, Imagine is a pretty and simple song. It seems to be sad, yet hopeful, and makes you think what could have been in his life, had he not been murdered. It\u2019s like an oxymoron- imagining the world and all the people at peace, yet some crazy fan shoots him after he signs his autograph. At the same time, it makes me sad how he treated Julian, his ex-wife, and others, while he\u2019s pushing world peace. I love his songs and music, but I feel sorry for the mixed up man he was and his unstable background. Some of my favorite Beatle songs are written by him. I just went to my son\u2019s wedding 4 days ago. He totally surprised me by playing \u201cIn My Life\u201d as the mother/groom dance. I cried because it meant so much to me that we both love that song, and he remembered that from years before. There are other songs I love just as much that John sang, such as \u201cIf I Fell\u201d. There are many Beatle songs I love. I cannot believe how much the Beatles songs have touched my life, as corny as that is. But to answer the question, I honestly can\u2019t answer. I just wanted to put in my two cents in that I don\u2019t think you can compare their songs against their other songs. There\u2019s so many brilliant songs by them all. In my life, I love them all.

            "answer_text": "As Patrica Edwards has said, it depends on your personal opinion. In my opinion I not only don\u2019t think it is his greatest song, I don\u2019t even like it. I find it very cloying with embarrassing cliched lyrics. I used to be able sit through it waiting for the next song but then the song took on a whole new meaning when John was murdered. It is now part of a small cannon of John Lennon songs that seem to represent the \u201cnew John\u201d as reinvented by Yoko. Anyway, there are many other songs that I could think of that I could say is the best song that John ever wrote. Strawberry Fields Forever, I am the Walrus, A Day in the Life to name just three. I think Imagine has also overshadowed his solo career songs. Tracks from John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band like Working Class Hero are raw and not sugar coated and songs from Walls and Bridges are more sugar coated but have a lot of soul and pain to them such as Scared. So, No. I don\u2019t think Imagine is the best song that John Lennon ever wrote, and that is not a fact, it is merely my opinion. ",
