            "answer_text": "All movies are shot at 24 frames per second. This is an inconvenient rate for viewing on PAL TVs - Which display 50 fields (or 25 frames) per second. Movies are therefore slightly sped-up for TV broadcast  (and DVD) in PAL territories. The audio is sped up too which causes the pitch change. In the US, 24 fps material can be mapped to 60 fields per second without a change in speed.   ",

            "answer_text": "I have noticed this as well. My guess would be that the pitch change is a result of shortening or lengthening the song to affect runtime. I know radio stations often do this to get through the songs faster and create more advertising time. It seems that not many people notice this unless you compare the song off of the CD directly to the radio edit. ",
