I remember that one evening while I was a child, a TV channel had dedicated the evening and night program to show all of her clip to show her progression. My parents told me to go to my room because it contains some sexual/nude scenes. But I stayed in the stairs, in secret, because I wanted to see the clips, which are really like short movies. I didn\u2019t know that my parents wanted to hide the nudity at the time. I stayed because in some clips, there were horses and I wanted to watch more. Anyway, the most marking one was this one (followed by \u201cPourvu qu\u2019elles soient douces\u201d). You have to imagine the little boy that I was, about 10yo or lower, sitting in the stairs, because I wanted to see in costume people riding horses.  So that not only screams \u201cFREEEENCH\u201d in my mind, but it reminds me my childhood in France too ^^ ",

Unfortunately French pop music has lost the shine it had in the, say 60\u2019s: Richard Anthony, Silvie Vartan, Johnny Halliday, Frances Gall, Francoise Hardy, The Surfs, etc\u2026 the classics: Aznavour, Gilbert Becaud, Charles Trenet, Edit Piaf (not my cup of tea), Jean Sablon,\u2026 ",
