            "answer_text": "To be very, very honest: you're right. Your chances are extremely slim.  I haven't heard of any kpop artist who isn't at least half Asian. Additionally, kpop idols and trainees who aren't Korean sometimes get bullied for their race, despite the fact that they look pretty much the same as everyone else. Looking Asian isn't enough; you have to be Asian to get in. Second of all, having rudimentary skills in both singing and dancing, which are the basic skills required to be a kpop idol, also hurts your chances quite a bit. There are thousands of people who can sing and dance equally well; it doesn't matter if you can act better than all of them combined, because acting skills are not necessary when auditioning to be a kpop idol. Sorry if this is a bit harsher than you wanted it to be; really, I mean no harm, I'm just being honest. And besides, being a kpop idol sucks. You don't want that kind of lifestyle, trust me. ",

            "answer_text": "No, just no.  Of course you're free to try if you really want to, but you really won't get anywhere for several reasons. First of all, the genre being called K-POP, most performers are Koreans, it's not as if it's impossible for foreigners of close relation to succeed,(Chinese,Japanese,etc) but you being a Hispanic male means you're unlikely to even set foot in Korea, let alone be scouted to an agency. The next issue, is that you're wayyyyyy older than most K-pop idols, it takes years to get to their level, and they start at 9-10 years old, your average singing and inability to dance only worsens that issue. And even if you were able to, through some miracle, it really isn't that great of a life, K pop idols have to deal with some terrible things: The dark side of \u2018perfect\u2019 K-pop world  Does this really sound like something you want to do? There's more reasons that I haven't thought of at the moment, but I thought I'd put this up real fast. ",
