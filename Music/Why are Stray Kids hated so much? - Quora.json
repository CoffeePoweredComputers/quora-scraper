            "answer_text": "Trigger warning: mentions of suicide. Important side note: I do not know any SKZ member personally, I am NOT BLACK, any false information will be edited/deleted immediately.  Dori Kay\u2019s answer is completely perfect and I couldn\u2019t add anything to it:Dori Kay's answer to Why are Stray Kids hated so much? but I want to give my own take on everything. (I\u2019ll use the same structure as in my ITZY answer) Common reason number 1: \u201cThey are from the big 3 and are privileged which means they do not deserve their fame.\u201d  I\u2019m not going to blatantly copy what I wrote about this but what I want to say is that big 3 groups also have it hard. It is immensely hard to get into these companies in the first place. Even though JYP has around 50 to 100 trainees now those people really needed to work to get into the company.The amount of pressure put onto these idols from the public is immense. These groups need to be as successful as their seniors, they need to be pretty, they need to be perfect and if they aren\u2019t they\u2019ll get called flops and untalented.The amount of pressure put onto them from the company is also quite big. They need to live up to impossible expectations that nobody can live up to, they need to constantly record things and barely have time off.They have full packed schedules that allow nearly no sleep.SKZ went through a survival show, lost two members and needed to fight to get them back. 3RACHA overwork themselves so Stray Kids get the good quality music we have now. Yet those people say that they don\u2019t even work. Really, do some research man because that argument is obsolete. Common reason number 2: \u201cTheir music is pure noise.\u201d People only (want to) see this:  (Side Effects is in no way a bad song) But turn a blind eye to this:  And this:  This argument is literally made to bully the popular groups and only the popular groups (ATEEZ, ITZY, NCT 127 and Stray Kids). Never have I heard anyone complain about \u201cSidekick\u201d from K-Tigers Zero or \u201cSugar free\u201d by T-ARA or \u201cColor me Rad\u201d by D.Holic and the list goes on and on. Maybe I\u2019m completely wrong but this argument only exists to drag down the popular groups. Music is noise. End of discussion. Common reason number 3: \u201cThey are ugly.\u201d or in k-pop fashion \u201cThey aren\u2019t a visual group\u201d Does every group you stan need to be the handsomest group ever? Do you need glasses as I can\u2019t see the ugly part in your statement?   And no, Changbin isn\u2019t ugly.  Chan isn\u2019t ugly as well.  Why does everyone always say: \u201cIdols should be chosen based on talents and not visuals.\u201d yet why do you bully Changbin and call him ugly and fat? Common reason number 4: \u201cThey are copying BTS.\u201d Just because they self produce doesn\u2019t mean they stole that from BTS. There are so many other idols who self-produce (LE, CL, Chaeyoung (from TWICE), SEVENTEEN). BTS didn\u2019t invent self-production so stop acting like that can be stolen.Both groups write about their struggles in life. Again, BTS didn\u2019t invent that. It isn\u2019t illegal or bad to write about self-love or about the struggles of life. Stop bashing groups like ITZY, Stray Kids and Cignature for singing about self-love.Hyunjin copying V. They might both be great dancers and may look a bit the same but that doesn\u2019t mean Hyunjin decided to copy everything from V. Yes, they both have dogs but does that really matter in idol life? Go do something else with your time.So argument debunked. Common reason number 5: \u201cThey are talentless.\u201d     Yep, totally no talent or skill whatsoever. (If you have other good clips feel free to let me know) Common reason number 6: \u201cI don\u2019t like their personalities.\u201d It\u2019s totally okay to not like their personalities but what\u2019s not okay is to make fun of them for it. Stop mocking Chan and Felix for their Australian accents. Stop bullying Changbin for his Aegyo. That crosses the line. Let them be themselves. Let them be happy. Common reasons number 7 and 8: \u201cHyunjin and Chan.\u201d For Hyunjin:  That copying V thing I explained earlier. It\u2019s silly and childish of you to act that way so stop it.He isn\u2019t mean or rude. Hanne Pluim's answer to Is SKZ Hyunjin mean/rude? He\u2019s just a guy with feelings.Orbits stop bullying Hyunjin and say that he should change his name. It\u2019s impossible to not have 2 idols with the same name. Get over it. It isn\u2019t the end of the world. If you want LOONA Hyunjin content so bad type in \u201cLOONA Hyunjin\u201d it isn\u2019t that hard.About the blackface. I\u2019m just going to put this here and you can decide for yourself if you want to forgive him or not.\u201cStray Kids Everywhere All Around the World.\" As you could see in our signature phrase; we, Stray Kids, always try our best to understand everyone across the world and our beloved STAY as much as possible, and as deeply as possible. We strongly believe that everyone, no matter which culture they are in, has the right to be respected; therefore, we reject all discrimination based on any orientation and oppose all forms of inequality in the world. Yet, we are still lacking in many things and we are trying our hardest to become better. We would like to apologize to anyone if we have stepped on a rake. It was never our intention but due to our lack of understanding. We promise you that we will do our best to become better Stray Kids.\u2800#BlackLivesMatter#WeOpposeAnyFormsOfInequality#WeAppreciateCulturalDiversity#YouMakeStrayKidsStay#StrayKidsEverywhereAllAroundTheWorld\" As for Chan:  The only actual questionable thing he has done are the cornrows. Choose for yourself if you want to forgive him or not.He isn\u2019t a racist. Whatever you think he said isn\u2019t true. He isn\u2019t a racist ninjas is the unofficial fandom name of 3RACHA.He isn\u2019t a pedophile. What makes you think that? He has never said anything that\u2019s in the range of being sexually attracted to minors. Nearly nobody had a problem with the joke so why do you need to ruin it? The ones who bullied the user and Chan in that thread: You\u2019re not just bad, you\u2019re terrible. The ones who mocked Chan in the song 42: You\u2019re disgusting. Get off the internet. We will never need you. And to the ones who make fun of Chan for his physical appearance: School has thought us that the inside matters more than the outside so educate yourself and learn some manners.I think everybody would be disgusted if they saw that someone would get these types of messages.    Chan saw that. (For a more in-depth explanation about Chan: Hanne Pluim's answer to What are all the controversies Bangchan has been a part of? (Yes I know it\u2019s my own answer but it has some of the more recent controversies in it.)) We interrupt this answer for an important newsflash: !BREAKING NEWS!: K-POP IDOLS HAVE FEELINGS TOO. Haters isn\u2019t it time to stop? Chan has suffered. Stray Kids have suffered. They can get hurt physically but also emotionally. They can be broken. Do you really think Chan trained 7 years just to get called a racist?  Do you really think Changbin threw away all his studies just to get called fat and ugly?  Do you really think Felix left his home country just to get told to kill himself?  I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re perfect but what I am saying is that the amount of slander they\u2019ve been getting is unneeded and disgusting. They\u2019ve suffered more than enough in their 2 year career. But the number 1 reason that SKZ is hated for isn\u2019t because of a certain member, it isn\u2019t because of their music or personalities. It\u2019s because: Haters are scared of Stray Kids. No I don\u2019t mean that they are scared of the members but they are scared that Stray Kids will become bigger than their faves. SKZ already have quite a bit of success and haters are scared that SKZ will become massive. That\u2019s why they get so much unnecessary hate. People try to drag Stray Kids down so they won\u2019t become successful. But spoiler alert to you delusional stans: \u201cStray Kids will become big. No matter how many times you drag them to hell they\u2019ll come back bigger, better and stronger.\u201d So haters stop. You might hate the boys with your entire heart but you don\u2019t have to let the world know that. So haters if you want to keep bullying Stray Kids, see Chan collapse or see a member die then go for it but don\u2019t go and whine when you become the most hated person in society, when you\u2019ll get fined and when you go to jail. Your actions have consequences and one day or another you\u2019re going to feel those consequences. And I hope that day comes soon. So cut some slack on these young boys. Bless them. Enjoy your day/night.  ",

            "answer_text": "Ooo, let\u2019s go. My reply got long, so enjoy some SKZ pics in the middle randomly.  They are unique I usually hate when people use this reason as why someone is getting hated, but in the case of SKZ this really happens. As Stray Kids is self producing, and the music we get is almost exlusively their brainchild, their style changes a lot- especially since Channie loves to experiment with different music styles (haka in 3RACHA\u2019s Zone is a good example).People say their music is \u201cnoise\u201d, because it doesn\u2019t have the generic k-pop sound always. Their stage presence The fact that this keeps coming up is ridicolous - there\u2019s people out there who say SKZ has no stage presence, like look:  \u201cSKZ is copying BTS omg\u201d No, they really don\u2019t. There\u2019s a literal video where: JYP says Stray Kids should never copy BTSChan saying he wants to make completely unique musicJust because both of the groups have lyrics about struggles, that doesn\u2019t mean SKZ is stealing from BTS - they don\u2019t even need it, with how productive 3RACHA is when it comes to making music. I won\u2019t even address the whole \u201cHyunjin is copying Taehyung\u201d thing. Just because both of them are amazing dancers and look somewhat similar, Hyunjin got accused with copying Tae\u2019s moles and dog for example. Kkami is older than Tannie, and a different breed.  People saying they are talentless The rapline: 3RACHA, Hyunjin, Felix, Minho - At the YG vs. JYP battle, YG literally said, that Changbin and Han are the strongest rappers he had ever seen on that stage. He was talking about the stage where for example iKon and Bigbang performed before. Just fyi. Seriously Stray Kids have one of the strongest raplines in the industry. Also Hyunjin\u2019s flow and style is improving scary quick, and with 3RACHA raising him, he will turn into one of the best rappers. Their vocals: Chan/Woojin/Seungmin/Han/I.N. - SKZ\u2019s vocals have very wide range and are fairly stable with great breathing, however I wouldn\u2019t say they have an outstanding vocal line. People say they can\u2019t sing though, which is simply not true. Chan: I\u2019m just going to copy what I wrote on this topic before, about whether Channie is problematic and if he deserves the hate he\u2019s getting (spoiler: NO)  Anyways, this is why people attack him: He had cornrows/dutch braids (depending on who you ask) at 3RACHA special stage, and people got really upset at him - I wouldn\u2019t go into details as to whether this is problematic or isn\u2019t, since I\u2019m not qualified to do so, but the fact he got death threats and people petitioning him to be kicked out of SKZ is over the top. I\u2019m confident both Channie and JYPE\u2019s stylists will learn, since this literally happened with Jackson of GOT7 before.People thinking he said the \u2018n-word\u2019: he said ninjas, then literally addressed the fact people misheard him in another rap, and people still think he was trying to replace the n-word - no he wasn\u2019t, ninjas is 3RACHA\u2019s unofficial fandom name.The whole depression thing: a girl said she was sad after SKZ concert, and Chanwas joking with her about how she has post concert depression (which is a typical stan twitter term) - this got turned into a whole issue by his haters, saying that he was making fun of/appropriating depressionPeople conspiring about his mental health: this is SO disrespectful, like holy shit. They were saying things about his mental health to the extent that Chan himself had to address it on VLIVE, literally telling people to stop worrying and that he\u2019s fine.In general: just cut Stray Kids some fucking slack Because of the fact they are putting out a crazy amount of music, and tend to look like they debuted ages ago, we can\u2019t forget that these boys are a) young asf 18\u201321 years olds b) the group is less than 2 years old. I won\u2019t act like anything SKZ touches is perfect, since they are self-producing their sound changes a lot, and sometimes it\u2019s rough around the edges They pour their heart and soul into every performance, latest example of this is when they performed at Lotte Duty Free in a billion degrees with so much energy for a nearly quiet crowd, that it could have flipped the house. Whether you accept it or not, they will only be getting bigger - and while it\u2019s okay to criticize them, comparing them to BTS is not fair\u2026 yet anyways. +1 People who say Chan needs to leave Without him, Stray Kids won\u2019t exist. He created SKZ, he fought for them, he makes most of the music for them, he protects them, helps them etc. \u201cStray Kids nine or none, we gonna cross the finish line.\u201d ",
