            "answer_text": "Because the definition of a folk song is a simple, short melody improvised by someone with no musical training and no desire to extend it into a longer, more structured piece. Perhaps someone will come up with an example of folk music that DOES have a key change. I\u2019ve heard some Russian stuff that is intriguingly fluid between minor and major modes (though that wouldn\u2019t be written with ever-changing key signatures). And once folk music gets \u2018collected\u2019 and written down, the line between \u2018folk\u2019 and \u2018composed\u2019 can get blurred. But, generally, folk music keeps it simple. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I dunno for sure, but my guess is, to keep them fairly simple. A musically simple song, more people can enjoy enjoy it. They can sing them or hear the song\u2019s story without being distracted by unnecessary musical ornamentation (like a key change). Think about holiday songs like \u201cjoy to the world\u201d: that goes \u201cdo te la so fa me re do\u201d which is just \u201cdo re me\u201d backward. It\u2019s a generality but I\u2019d say folk songs are not musically nuanced on purpose so more folks can enjoy them. Just my opinion, I\u2019d be interested to hear somebody else\u2019s. ",
