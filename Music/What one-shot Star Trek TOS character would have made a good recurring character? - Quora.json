            "answer_text": "Due to the limited number of guest stars that had a role that came from a species that could perform intergalactic travel, there are not as many options as one might first think. Staying with the call of the question, limiting to \u201cone shot\u201d characters, I would eliminate Khan as he returned as a star in the movie role. But for characters with classic lines, he has some diamond studded ones. A quality protagonist with a decent original script that wrote in his greed and lust for power. Let\u2019s break down our nominees by season. Season 1: Trelane, \u201cThe Squire of Gothos\u201c The Gorn from \u201cArena\u201c Balock from \u201cThe Corbomite Maneuver\u201d For my money, Balock has to be eliminated in the preliminary round. Once he has been found to be a lovable child, the drama of the protagonist was gone. In addition, if fans had trouble with a highly intelligent Wesley Crusher, think of the backlash a super advanced 5 year old would have created in repeat performances. Trelane has potential if written correctly. If he \u201cescaped\u201d from his parents to terrorize the crew again in different ways the writers would have to pull a better resolution by Kirk and Co. out of their typewriters than the original. Mommy and daddy catching toddler just in the nick of time would be yawn making drama repeat. Our Gorn friend has more potential. Hideous to humans initially, if developed you could make him a fantastic protagonist. To make an intelligent reptile also makes sci-fi sense. His voice had a hint of evil to him and he almost bested Kirk.  Season 2: Zefram Cochran In \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d The Gangsters from \u201cA Piece of the Action\u201c Rojan and Kalinda from \u201cBy Any Other Name\u201d Mister Seven from \u201cAssignment Earth\u201c While, the plot of \u201cA Piece of the Action\u201d did have McCoy leaving his communicator on the planet as a teaser, I don\u2019t want to sit through another game of Fizbin or cheap portrayals of Chicago gangsters. Plus, the idea that the Enterprise leaves and those crime bosses don\u2019t revert right back to their old ways is naive. The gangsters lose in my preliminary round for season two. Zefram would be interesting but he is leashed to the planet he inhabits and asked for solitude. I don\u2019t see this occurring without twisting the original script to shreds. Plus you could rule him out because of the characters appearing the movie \u201cFirst Contact\u201d although that might qualify as an excel since it was a prequel. Rojan and Kalinda could return frustrated with the speed and perceived lack of prioritization by the Federation\u2019s help with their assimilation. The prior script had the Kelvan\u2019s realize that their human forms would not be accepted by their race, so their desire to return home as a new script concept would be compromised. The original script did label them a conqueror race. If the new script displayed their ability to built a ship and conquer, then we have some conflict with a potentially formidable foe. Mister Seven is such an enigma that it is hard to know where a second script would journey. Is he a good guy? Is he friend or foe? I think to turn him into a protagonist would be more of a plot twist than the Kelvans, and that script was not a favorite, so I will pick the Kelvans to make it to the finals.  Let me premise the third year with the warning, if anyone involved in Trek nation submits a script were the whiny mini-skirt girl from Spock\u2019s Brain returns, I will rip my ears out and eyes out in that order. Everyone let the shiver out of their system on that thought and let us continue. Season 3: The female Romulan Commander in \u201cThe Enterprise Incident\u201dKang from \u201cDay of the Dove\u201dThe Tholians from \u201cThe Tholian Web\u201d\u201cElaan of Troyius\u201dFlint from \u201cRequiem for MethuselahWhile the female commander was played extremely well, to make a new script work, she would have had to be released by the Federation and is now commanding a new ship and seeking revenge. It has potential but I think fans would see the Romulans as requiring her to be executed for allowing a Vulcan sweet talk her into letting her guard down. Kang has potential. The voice, the perfect adversary, but a Klingon of reason that could open up new dialogues. An easy Segway with multiple options. The Tholians are a complete mystery and could open up a new adversary for the series. Nothing has more potential for evil than the unknown. Elaan of Troyius is just not my kind of girl and any second script would be tough to swallow if the same \u201ctrappings\u201d were not avoided. Flint is too distant and old to make a perfect antagonist. Not enough fire in the belly, he just wants to be left alone. Not what you want in a comeback script character. I want to place my vote on Kang. Too good to pass up the best Klingon warrior from TOS. The problem with Kang is he made it back in both DS9 and Voyager, so by my own rules, he is out and the Tholians are in for Season III.  My vote in the finals is easier than I originally thought. I have to stick with season one and go with the Gorn. If the commander came back and attacked a Star ship it would be like the moment in Saving Private Ryan when the soldier they showed mercy and released came back to shoot them. Or, the merciful act could be the catalyst to a new alliance that ends a war with the Tholians just as it was starting. I would hope the new script would include a new Gorn suit- make the eyes a bit more realistic- and work on the uniform a bit. The original rags were a bit risqu\u00e9 LL&P ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I always love a rogue, so I would say Harry Mudd or Cyrano Jones - but, arguably, the former DID ultimately become a recurring character. Harcourt Fenton Mudd appeared in two episodes of the original series, and again in later shows, most recently on Star Trek: Discovery, where he was played by Rainn Wilson. Cyrano Jones, the man responsible for unleashing tribbles on the Enterprise (and upon Deep Space Nine following the Defiant\u2019s return from the past in \u201cTrials and Tribbleations\u201d), appeared on a follow-up episode of the animated series, which is technically canon, but otherwise never made a subsequent appearance. His appearance in \u201cTrials and Tribbleations\u201d is old footage spliced with new, and he does not interact with anyone from the DS9 crew. My other choice would be a character who was intended as a regular but, due to meddling from the Powers That Be, ended up a one-shot: Number One, the first officer played by Majel Barrett in the original Star Trek pilot, \u201cThe Cage\u201d. Stoic and mysterious, I found her a fascinating figure. But Roddenberry was forced to choose between Number One or Spock, and he chose Spock, giving him Number One\u2019s more stoic personality in the process (this is why you can see footage of Spock smiling in the original pilot and in the later two-parter \u201cThe Menagerie\u201d which recycles the old footage). Majel Barrett, of course, would go on to play Nurse Christine Chapel, a recurring character in TOS. As with Harry Mudd, Number One has been revisited on Star Trek: Discovery, now played by Rebecca Romijn, and she has been included in some novels and comics, though fans generally only consider the TV shows and movies canon. Her onscreen appearances have been brief, though, even in subsequent series, and she\u2019s still something of a cypher. I would love to see more of her in the show, and to learn more about her. ",
