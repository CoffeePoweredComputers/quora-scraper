            "answer_text": "Listen to what? Where? When? The question is vague. There are different ways of listening intently to/in any given situation. Focus is where you start. You have to focus on whatever or whoever it is you want to listen to. And that can be difficult at times, especially if there are many distractions to draw away your attention. Depending on what it is you are endeavoring to hear, there are ways to facilitate focus. If you are in a classroom, for example, listening to a lecture, you can do your best to laser beam focus on the lecturer/instructor, but it also helps if you can record the lecture. Sitting as close as you can to the lectern is also helpful. If it's music you want to listen to; headphones or earbuds are quite useful when in public, or even at home sometimes. If you're talking about conversations, again, it comes down to focus, and ascribing importance to what the other or others in the conversation are saying. If you are \u201clistening but not hearing,\u201d it is probably because you don't truly perceive any importance to what is being said. Those are basic approaches to a limited number of situations, but I hope this has helped. ",
