(Sto Lat) - the same as Many Happy / Here's to...**Bitter! (Gorzko!) - wedding guests shout it, when they want to young couple kiss each other. Passionate revenge song sung by a spurned lover who\u2019s poisoned her ex\u2019s wedding feast. Song I dislike the most: American Pie American Pie (song) - Wikipedia Pathetically sentimental, far too simple, far too repetitive. ",

The song encapsulates the mindset of a hopeless romantic. A man who wants something so impossible that he suffers uselessly in his endeavor. I like analyzing and sympathizing the life of romantics. My least favorite song is Yellow by Coldplay. The thing that I hate about it is the fact that they\u2019ve wasted great vocals on such a meaningless lyrics. And in the process garnered unprecedented popularity. It shows how dumb and gullible the masses can be. ",
