            "answer_text": "Why not tell us what YOU think is wrong with Mahler\u2019s Symphony No.5 in order to receive feedback upon whether or not we agree? The question presumes that there MAY be something wrong with it, in which case there are two possibilities: 1) You have read somewhere of a problem and wonder what that problem is 2) That you personally have a problem with it. As to 1), if you have read of a problem but the problem was not stated, then it can immediately be discounted as the words of a second rate musicologist. Why? Because any opinion worthy of consideration requires justification and any musicologist who fails to provide justification is unworthy of academic consideration. As to 2), if you personally have an issue with it, that is absolutely fine, but tell us. It may well be that in certain respects there is widespread agreement. To put Mahler\u2019s output into some kind of historical perspective may help, nevertheless: He was a contemporary of Richard Strauss, but had a much shorter life. In the first half of the 20th century, it was Richard Strauss who was regarded as the more significant composer, although he was considered to have gone \u201coff the boil\u201d after Der Rosenkavlier (1911). Mahler\u2019s status as a composer, even as late as 1967, was not significant enough in Richard Anthony Leonard\u2019s book The Stream Of Music for him to be given his own section. His name was tagged on to the section devoted to Richard Strauss. This is what Leonard summarised of Mahler: \u201cGreater composers than Mahler would have failed before the task of welding such masses of amorphous material; Mahler\u2019s problem went even deeper. His real gift was for song. Thus he was a lyric poet trying to be a prophet\u201d (from \u201cThe Stream Of Music\u201d first published in 1945 and further revised 1967). However, a future generation of certain conductors, particularly of the calibre of Leonard Bernstein, were key figures in bringing Mahler an almost godlike status in the 70s onwards, so much so that he was spoken of in the same exalted tones as accorded to Beethoven. Time out here: composers and their relative significance, are sometimes subject to the vagaries of \u201cfashion\u201d, and both Mahler and Strauss are examples. The present day situation is this: ardour for his music has once more somewhat cooled since those heady days of the 1970s and 1980s. He still has staunch advocates, but is no longer perceived as some kind of deity. So, with regard to your original question: In the light of this historical outline, where do you stand? ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe it was a bit too long for the mad rush of the last decades; but during the last two months things slowed down a bit. If you really want, now you can still appreciate it. Some opinionated \u201ccritics\u201d may object to the \u201clack of unity\u201d of the symphony; but the Romantic \u201dbelief in unity as the ultimate aesthetic value\u201d was never as restrictive as some might believe. The orchestration changes between movements; and the key changes (from C-sharp minor to A minor, then D major, F major and finally to D major) might seem a bit abrupt if one is used to same or related key movements. Wikipedia: A technical device much used by Mahler is that of \"progressive tonality,\" which Deryck Cooke describes as \"the procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that in which it was stated\". Mahler was an unconventional composer; yet this is one of his less unconventional compositions, easier to digest than some of his other works. One of the side effects of this current plague (called Glorification of Musical Illiteracy) is the rejection of classical music. Well, a symphony by Mahler, or even a \u201csimple\u201d prelude by Bach doesn\u2019t have to make sense on the first listening. Even if you are a trained musician, there are many cases when you have to listen to the same work for several times, preferably in different interpretations, before you can say that you \u201cget\u201d it. And even then, you can still discover new layers, new nuances on the 517th listening. ",
