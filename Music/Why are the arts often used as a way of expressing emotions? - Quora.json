            "answer_text": "Because emotions are important for us, in our lives. But having said this, let me hasten to add that this is neither the only purpose of visual art (and the others), nor are emotions just a simple, raw thing. Emotions belong to the bedrock of our existence: meeting people or animals, seeing, hearing or realizing something, we smile, we frown, we draw our eyebrows, we get a heartbeat/are excited, lucky, sad, astonished, curious, flustered, confused, ashamed, afraid, angry, proud... and with all these emotions we follow an end defined through our cultural existence. We constantly express them, in our actions, language (not only through our words, but also through the way we talk: imagine the sentence \"I am a teacher\" said in a normal way, a fearful one, and in an angry shout). Now, if emotions form such a large aspect of our very humanity, why should they not be expressed by the arts? But do arts only or even predominantly \"express\"? I maintain that ever so often, they fulfill another purpose: to illustrate, demonstrate something, to inflict something in the recipient. Fear, for instance: remember those dragon heads at the top of Viking ships? They were first of all meant to frighten the shit out of the asses of those who saw those ships approaching the coast, or coming up a river. They don't express fear, they inflict it. Similar for any religious art: illustration, certainly, but also personification, inflicting awe, fear, banning demons or ghosts, helping someone in the next life... you name it. (Some of these thoughts are lifted, by the way, from Alfred Gell's book \"art and agency\".) ",

            "answer_text": "Art is usually involves emotion such as passion, some are very criticle of their art and others casual. Art allows your creativity to thrive and flourish and many choose art as a method of emotional therapy. Some enjoy art but may be introverts and keep it to themselves while others who are more external like extroverts prefer to share and be seen. Either way what they feel is often exhibited in their work, be it music, performance, novels, poetry or paint, we express ourselves through it. Without emotional content the arts would likely not be so attractive, so bright, unusual, alarming or comforting. There are those who express themselves verbally, politically and through action, they may or may not possess artistic skills or talent, then they may but choose to express themselves through other ways such as their work. Artists are in general very sensitive and many are divas. To critisize their work is to critisized their children, their abilities, their life. They can be very moody, arrogant, belligerent, they can be very emotional, unstable even to the point where there sanity is questionable. Their art is often their only way to release their emotions, thoughts, angers, passion, love or frustration. It is not always pretty but it can be breathtaking. It can bring one to tears or make someone remember the best things in life. Most artists feed off the creation to their art, others do not care what people think, they rebel through their art or just get satisfaction and therapy from the act or completion of it and have no need or desire for anyone to see it. In fact some may find their art so personal and revealing that it is like a diary or path to their sole. But art is emotion in its most raw and expressionable form. No psychiatrist or therapy or questions but ones deepest emotions good or bad are exposed freely through art. ",
