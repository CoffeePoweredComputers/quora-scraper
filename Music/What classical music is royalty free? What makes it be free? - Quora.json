            "answer_text": "The thing that makes it free is called \u201cpublic domain\u201d. It comes into effect a certain number of years after a composer or artist has died. This applies to ALL music, not just classical music, by the way. For example, in many European countries, Elvis\u2019s music is now public domain. Public domain simply means that the work is legally considered to be \u201cpublic property\u201d so anyone can use it without owing royalties or having to pay any fees to anyone. Unfortunately there\u2019s no simple answer to your question, since public domain laws vary from place to place. In some countries, music becomes public domain 50 years after the composer/artist has died. In other countries it can be as much as 150 years! So you just have to find out what the laws are for you locally. And there\u2019s another complication. The piece of music itself may be public domain, but RECORDINGS are often themselves copyrighted, and subject to rights and royalties. So, if you want to use the London Symphony\u2019s recording of Beethoven\u2019s 5th, for example, you would still be required to get permission and probably pay a fee to use that music, even though Beethoven\u2019s music is public domain worldwide. The actual music may be free, but the PERFORMANCE you are using may not be. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically all classical music is royalty free although things are not that easy. The sheet music might be royalty free as most composers died long ago and the copyright expired however publishers make new editions and they own the rights to this editions so they are not royalty free. Old editions have expired rights, so these can be free. Look at imslp.org. Performers and record labels own the rights to their own recordings. So royalties should be payed to these performers and record labels. So in short. The music is royalty free, anything that carries the music isn\u2019t. ",
