It means you should have cross posted the video somewhere while it still had a sound file attached to it. More specifically it means that the artist, their distributor, ASCAP, or any number of other parasites on any musician who gets big fear that somehow having a 15 second clip of their song on TikTok is preventing them from getting their god given right to a slice of someone else\u2019s pie. Yeah, I know \u201cbut the exact opposite\u201d! I think, unless it is the artist who is lodging the complaint, that these groups believe that they can extort money out of TikTok by way of royalties for usage. They wont- as evidenced by your soundless video. TikTok might have the note which says that there is some attempt ongoing to obtain rights but in all the time I have been there I have never seen one sound which was taken down go back up unless it was posted again by an individual. TikTok would only be throwing money into a wood chipper if they started trying to negotiate use beyond commonly accepted \u201cfair use\u2019. Long story short: if you want sound on that video you will have to download the video, upload a version of the sound and then upload the video as if you were making a new post. Place your sound on it and nudge until you get the lip sync right. If it is one of those sped up or slowed down versions I warn you it will be a major pain in the ass to do so. Good luck and dont forget to cross post if you want to be sure you will always be able to see your vids as you made them. ",

            "answer_text": "This means that TikTok has yet to confirm that it has permission to use that particular song from its rights holder. TikTok is still required to follow international copyright law and the use of music in TikToks is subject to approval from the copyright holder. When you upload an \u2018original sound\u2019, you warrant that you hold the rights to that piece of content. Some songs are popularly used on TikTok and then removed from the platform at the request of the copyright holder. This often results in TikToks you have liked or saved having no audio if you revisit them after a few weeks/months. Thanks for the A2A.
