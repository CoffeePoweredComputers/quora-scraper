            "answer_text": "I am not sure how you define \u201cfamous\u201d. A person who everyone knows as fact or a person who every person has seen and/or heard in a public setting. As for the first, I would say Neil Armstrong because being the first person to set foot on another world, more people have heard that name for that purpose than anyone else. But Armstrong always avoided the adulation and didn\u2019t appear in public very much. So, not a lot of people remember seeing him in person, but they do know who he was and what he did. The other answer would be either Buzz Aldrin or John Glenn. Glenn was a HUGE hero after he went up in space in 1962, becoming the first American to orbit the Earth and then becoming an Ohio Senator for many years, running for President and returning to space as the oldest person ever. Aldrin has probably been the most visible astronaut in the past 20 years, particularly since Glenn has passed. He has been on TV a number of times, even appearing in TV commercials. He has become a type of icon when it comes to being an astronaut and the second man to walk on the moon. If I were to name one person, overall, I would Aldrin. When mention is made of the first man on the moon, Armstrong, it\u2019s almost a \u201cgiven\u201d that people know Aldrin because Armstrong didn\u2019t do it alone. He just happened to be the first and, unlike Aldrin, hasn\u2019t sought fame as Buzz has. Someone might mention Gagarin, but that would be in Russia more here. You would be surprised at the number of people here who could name Alan Shepherd, Armstrong, Glenn and Aldin, but don\u2019t know Gagarin. Of course, him being killed just a short time after he went to space didn\u2019t help his fame. Even more people in Russia can name Armstrong and Aldrin than people in the US would know ANY Russian astronaut. That\u2019s how bad our young people are with history in 2019. ",
