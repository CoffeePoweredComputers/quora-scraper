            "answer_text": "Great question. First of all, I usually don't go out trying to find music for my mashups. Most often I'm just listening to music when I find a song that I think would be good for a mashup, and write it down for later. But how do I decide which songs are good for mashups? Most often, I find songs where the vocals are much better than the rest of the song, or the background is much better than the vocals. After all, that is the point of the mashup, right? To make a better song than the original. So, if I find that there are really awesome vocals for a song but a lackluster background (ex. Kendrick Lamar\u2019a Backseat Freestyle) or vice versa, I'll consider those songs for mashups. Here's my SoundCloud if you'd like to hear what kind of songs appeal to me: Mark & Dev ",

            "answer_text": "Musicians feel it and hear it. The same way you automatically know that certain songs don\u2019t go together. Of course many amateur mashup makers use simple available tools like genious, BPM analysers, acoustid .org and many others to determine what is similar and it works out great. A sense of humour and flare for percussion are always a winner. ",
