            "answer_text": "This question can probably be answered better and more accurately by an indian musician familiar wth both indian and western pop tradition. But what I hear is a regular popsong with relatively simple structure. Regarding melody as performed by the singers, there are indian style flourishes, grace notes, or embellishments to nearly every tone and regarding harmony you can hear western modulations. The instrumentation is a very nice combination of indian and western instruments. Western music is so dominant world-wide that you can find pop-music forms probably in every country in the world, where the singing is done in local style, which makes it unique alright, but with standarized western structures using drums, bass, synths etc., which makes it marketable worldwide. That is not to say that every local music is like that, fortunately. Of course there are many places where local folk music is still being played with gusto or where cross-over to westernized stuff is more subtle. ",
