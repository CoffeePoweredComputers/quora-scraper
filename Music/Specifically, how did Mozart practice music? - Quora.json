            "answer_text": "Mozart was famous for his ability to hear a piece of music ones, regardless of its breadth (including several voices, multiple instrument etc.) and reproducing it as music sheets very precisely. His genius was inherent in this ability: he perceived the internal relationships in music without having to 'take it apart'. From a very early age he would perform music prima vista (i.e. without having seen the score previously) and was also proficient in improvising, and also improvising in a certain style (this was referred to in the film and play 'Amadeus'), which was considered a far more virtuosic art than playing existing music. After his infancy, he rarely performed publically music not written by him; he was a great admirer of J.S. Bach (in which he was unusual, for the time) and Haydn and must have studied their work privately. ",
