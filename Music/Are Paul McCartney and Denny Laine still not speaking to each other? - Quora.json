            "answer_text": "As far as I know they were never not speaking to each other. Denny left Wings because in the wake of John Lennon\u2019s death Paul was afraid to tour lest he be shot, and Denny wanted to tour. I think a Wings reunion would be a bit forced now simply because they went in different directions after Wings. (I've seen both in concert.) Paul is basically a pop star. His music is as modern as a 70 old British dude can be, and he acts the part. Denny, on the other hand, is and has always been more blues-oriented. He's the sort of guy who\u2019s just on stage to have a good time, and who plays lots of 50s rock covers. Their styles nowadays are basically incompatible. I rest my case. ",

But they've changed it so my answer doesn't really make sense anymore. Why do Quora continue to do this? Anyway, Why on earth would Paul McCartney even contemplate a Wings reunion? Even if he Denny Laine were now the best of mates there is absolutely no way McCartney would reunite a band that he finished with almost forty years ago. The closest McCartney gets to a Wings reunion is as about as close he gets to a Beatles reunion, by playing the songs live on stage. ",
