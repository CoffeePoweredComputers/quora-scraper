            "answer_text": "What happens when you press the key? Does it make a sound but fails to come back up again? Does it make no sound? Does it stay down until you lift it up? That is difficult to answer. There could be many causes. Are you mechanically inclined and enjoy fixing things? If not, and if it\u2019s an expensive and valuable piano, call a qualified piano technician. But if the answer is yes, and if the piano isn\u2019t especially valuable, and you are willing to have a go, then go to your public library and get a copy of \u201cPiano Tuning, Servicing, and Restoration\u201d by Arthur Reblitz. Read it carefully. If at that point you feel overwhelmed, go ahead and call a tech, knowing that at least you now have a greater knowledge and appreciation for your piano. Otherwise, once you have read the book, grab a flashlight and see if you can locate the problem. You can always come back here and ask again. ",
