            "answer_text": "I think it depends on what placement you\u2019re using to hit these notes you\u2019re talking about. I mean obviously going down to an A1 can\u2019t be done without using either chest voice, vocal fry, or sub harmonics. And without extensive training (no matter how that\u2019s carried out, other than it being carried out correctly) men can\u2019t really hit an E5 without switching to falsetto. Even the most talented prodigies have something to work on: they can do a lot of amazing stuff with their voice but they still work on it for it to shine in the best way. I also would like you to ask yourself what notes you find yourself most comfortable singing. ",

            "answer_text": "If you can\u2019t sing well, flat or sharp for example, your breathing is obviously to blame. As Eilen Farrell, she of the amazing voice, who could sing opera to perfection and also delight every listener with her renditions of the popular music of the day, always advised would-be singers that the first thing is to get their breath. This mean breathing not through in gulps through the mouth , but learning how to take the air in through the nose, in a column initiated and supported by the action of the diaphragm and let out \u201cover\u201d the vocal chords, never straining them, into an imaginary \u201cmask\u201d or area in front of the head. This takes a lot of practice. ",
