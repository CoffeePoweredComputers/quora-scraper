            "answer_text": "Why did David Bowie not lose his hair, if he had chemotherapy treatment for his cancer? Because David likely had infusions of chemo toxins, which did not affect his hair follicles. A 4 year survival with advanced liver cancer is nothing to be but amazed at. He went out at the top of his game, in my opinion (as did Freddie Mercury). I had 16 infusions of gemcitabine (trade name Gemzar) from mid-July to mid-December 2015 in the wake of a successful Whipple procedure for pancreatic cancer that June. My symptoms were mild flu-like aches and malaise, plus the day after, crashing fatigue. I had zero hair loss, other than the male pattern baldness, which runs in my family. I was 58 3/4 years old when chemo was done. Here I am 1,985 days post-diagnosis, with no signs of recurrence, metastasis or other cancer. ",
