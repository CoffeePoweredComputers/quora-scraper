            "answer_text": "It is not about heroin. I was told\u2026. Maynard\u2019s first son, Devo H. Keenan was born in 1995, a year before this song was released. Two years later, during the 1997 Lollapooloza tour Maynard announced \"This next song is about having children, do any of you have kids? It is amazing how much they change your life isn't it?\" before playing H. Lyrics - Interpretation \u201cWhats coming through is alive\u201d - Giving Birth \u201cMy blood before me begs me open up my heart again\u201d - Devo, his blood, wants to be loved, all children do. \u201cI feel this coming over like a storm again\u201d - All of the emotions that being a father brings. \u201cI am too connected to you, slip away to fade away, Days away I still feel you touching me, changing me, and considerately killing me\u201d - Devo is connected to him, days away.. while on tour waiting to come home to see him, killing me.. he misses him so much it is killing him. \u201cAnd as the snake is drowned and as i looked in his eyes my fear begins to fade recalling all of the times i could have cried then, I should have cried then\u201d - He has been scared of being a father but as he looks at his son the fear fades, he should of cried when his child was born because he was so happy. \u201cAnd as the snake is drowned and as i look in your eyes my fear begins to fade recalling all of the times i have died, and will die its alright i don't mind\u201d - MJK is now speaking to Devo, saying I\u2019m not scared anymore I\u2019m not scared your going to hurt me, and make me die inside, and all the times in the future that you will do it, i don\u2019t mind. I love you. You are my son. ",
