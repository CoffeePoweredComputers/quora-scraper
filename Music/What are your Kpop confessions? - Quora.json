            "answer_text": "I only think of the rap line + Tae when I think of BTS. My love is mostly directed at those members, but I still think the rest of them are great.J-Hope\u2019s face makes the best wallpaper aesthetics.I think Hendery should try going pink or purple or BLUE OMG. Bottom line, I hate that SM decided to turn him blonde.I\u2019m jealous of Ten\u2019s teeth.I\u2019m rereading this super long pirate AU ATEEZ fanfic the length of 3 YA novels and it\u2019s entertaining.That being said, I think it\u2019s okay to ship idols (just don\u2019t let them know about it).I don\u2019t think Pentagon are interesting people, but I think they\u2019re talented performers and that\u2019s why I stan.I am a notorious kpop-meme-thief.I solo stan Sanha from Astro, but to this day, I\u2019m still not sure why.I also solo stan Keonhee from Oneus because I think the others are pretty boring (please don\u2019t come after me To Moons)I really like aeygo, but I don\u2019t think it fits some contexts.I was a hardcore Wooyoung Thighs Enthusiast before Answer era.I\u2019ll listen to literally any group as long as their song is a bop.Jisung is my Stray Kids bias because he looked the coolest in God\u2019s Menu.I\u2019d stan Infinite/Ikon if they tweaked their sound just a little bit to sound more like ATEEZ.I\u2019m both very fond of TXT and very pressed by them.I want Hongjoong to act in a k-drama.I think it\u2019s sickening Pentagon has the best vocalists in k-pop and the Korean fans blacklisted them for one member dating.My favorite lightstick is Stray Kids\u2019.I wish I could listen to Hellevator, but the title makes me uncomfortable.I don\u2019t think idols should date if it could hurt their group.I recently \u201cjoined\u201d k-pop twitter despite saying I wouldn\u2019t and the locals getting pressed at everything we do is hilarious.Atinys aren\u2019t broke, we\u2019re just scrappy.More and More grew on me. Still sounds like a 2012 Alan Walker track though.I ordered a Hongjoong Thanxx PC because I knew no one else would want to due to the CA issue.I\u2019d never willingly learn Korean just because of k-pop.I think BigHit are merchandise scammers, and everyone willingly falls for their scams. Don\u2019t tell me the BTS Funko Pops aren\u2019t identical.I\u2019m a simp for the \u201cwhooo-weee\u201d sound in k-pop songs, like the one after the second verse in X1\u2019s \u201cFlash\u201d.I\u2019ve never thought of Astro as a cute group.Nostalgic Night is an S-tier k-pop song, but most of ya\u2019ll aren\u2019t ready for that conversation.I don\u2019t think Pentagon will get a win if they don\u2019t get one in their last 2020 comeback.I didn\u2019t like Dr.Bebe, and I didn\u2019t think it deserved a win, but I still wanted Pentagon to get a win regardless.I used to dislike Daewhi because he seemed to be the Dawn of AB6IX, but I started to solo stan him after watching the Psycho cover with the 00\u2032 liners.I think Yunho is a better singer than Jongho.I switch between worrying for Lucas and being annoyed he looks like a model.I listen to Dreamcatcher b-sides more than their title tracks.I think Maddox looks like Yeonjun.TXT\u2019s Soobin looks like BTOB\u2019s Minhyuk looks like Yuzuru Hanyu.I don\u2019t hate AOA\u2019s Jimin because she didn\u2019t hurt me or my family.I don\u2019t like people who insist all k-pop stars are dating because that\u2019s just not statistically possible.I\u2019m pretty sure virgin k-pop idols exist.RTK was pointless for Pentagon since Korean fans still hate them for their history.I miss seeing k-pop random dances on my feed. Stupid virus.I think Rose is a better dancer than Lisa, but Lisa\u2019s still my bias because\u2026hm, not sure. Maybe it\u2019s the bangs?I could never be a k-pop idol. I hate changing clothes and I like eating pringles.I stan WayV less than my other faves because they feel more inaccessible as part of the larger NCT. It makes me feel some kind of way seeing Lucas and Ten in so many groups and not just WayV.I don\u2019t want more members to be added to WayV. I\u2019d probably end up unstanning tbh.I sometimes think RM should be my ult because I love my mans.I find v-lives where one member does nothing but talk really boring, even with subtitles.Kitten Girls\u2019 \u201cU Me Us\u201d is good, despite being the epitome of everything locals hate about kpop.I have a least favorite in every group I stan.I want BT21 sneakers pretty badly.I\u2019d never stop watching random_k\u2019s line distribution, even if they were found to be doing the same thing as Jaeguchi. Why? Because they put more effort into their videos anyway.I want to stan Oh My Girl, solely because of Mimi.Cix\u2019s company should focus more on Cignature, the superior group.I\u2019m still salty CIX, in their first days of debuting, took a win Pentagon really really deserved and one which universes worked very hard for.I\u2019m terrible at collecting votes.I spent 2 months on a game to collect over one thousand votes at once, only to have them all deleted.I think the 2019 MuBeat ROTY thing between atinys and moas was the most ridiculous fight I\u2019d ever witnessed in k-pop. It was just a poll.Heechul\u2019s face scares me.I don\u2019t wanna know details about idols\u2019 personal lives. I just want my quality fanservice.Looking at abs won\u2019t evoke any type of reaction from me.I feel bad for BTS half the time. Especially looking at the Baskin Robbin\u2019s commercial they did. I don\u2019t think they were actually excited about that.I don\u2019t get crushes on kpop idols.The term \u201cidol\u201d makes me uncomfortable but I just bear with it since it\u2019s faster and more accurate than \u201cartists\u201d.I think Wonpil is prettier than everyone else, sorry.I\u2019m upset the hourglass ATEEZ\u2019s lightstick doesn\u2019t rotate or flip.I like Somi, but I don\u2019t like her enough to be glad her first win would\u2019ve been ATEEZ\u2019s fifth.I don\u2019t stan Seventeen because they have too many members.I listen to Somi\u2019s \u201cBirthday\u201d every year on my birthday.I sold BTS-themed stickers to target the k-pop demographic at my high school.I have fever dreams about k-pop theories.Seongjoong content gives me serotonin. WooSan content gives me heartburn.I don\u2019t ship WooSan.Reddit atinys are intellectuals of the highest order. I am a Reddit atiny.I\u2019m halfway convinced ATEEZ\u2019s and Dreamcatcher\u2019s concepts overlap canonically, but I\u2019m a clown for hoping.I think Hui needs to hire some help. He certainly has enough money to do so.I feel like an undercover cop when checking out MCND content because they\u2019re all younger than me.Lucy\u2019s \u201cJogging\u201d is physically suffocating but \u201cFlowering\u201d makes me feel like I live in a nostalgic anime.I don\u2019t want to support Treasure because I don\u2019t like groups that start off with huge advantages, but \u201cGoing Crazy\u201d slaps.Privilege only matters to me if my faves are involved.My brother likes EXID\u2019s \u201cUp and Down\u201d but no other k-pop song and I fail to understand why.It makes me salty thinking about members who participate in songwriting/producing getting royalties from the song because I want every member to get the same amount of money.I readily acknowledge I am not the most rational k-pop fan.I considered quitting k-pop for good early this year because I felt the genre was becoming too stale.The thought still floats about but I wanna see how far ATEEZ goes first.",

            "answer_text": "Oh sh*t I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually doing this ._. k a l m thyself  Anyways, LeT\u2019s GeT iT: I thought SuperM\u2018s name was actually Sperm for a few months. Please don\u2019t tell me that I\u2019m the only one. I used to think Suga\u2019s name was Sugar, but when I found out it was actually Suga, I pronounced it as Soo-gah.I thought Twice had 18 members cuz of the Heart Shaker mv. I thought Felix from Stray Kids was part of NCT for some reason.I used to think Stray Kids was a synonym for Seventeen ;-;I thought Seventeen had 17 members.I used to think Woozi was Suga\u2019s identical twin. I thought WayV wasn\u2019t a part of NCT.I used to think Blackpink was a group with 5 members and couldn\u2019t tell Jennie from Jisoo.I thought Hwasa was the oldest in Mamamoo \ud83d\udc80I thought TXT stood for Together X Tomorrow and not Tomorrow X Together.I thought Vlive was Taehyung\u2019s.I used to think that Carats was a group name and that Ateez was the fandom .-.I thought that GFRIEND was spelled GFried and GFrend.I thought Jin was Jisoo\u2019s sibling. I mean, beholdth: I thought that Agust D, Suga, and Yoongi were three different people.I used to think Exo was spelled XO.I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between a hard and soft stan cuz both thirsted over their biases at least once in awhile.The first time I saw a Red Velvet video was the one where they performed in North Korea and thought that there were 6 members bc I don\u2019t know how to count.I partially only got into K-pop for the memes-I didn\u2019t really like the Ellen show interviews for BTS and SuperM.   I keep up with the K-pop world mostly through Youtube and Quora, rather than Weverse, Vlive, or Instagram which is why I don\u2019t know anything at all._.The only merch I have is an RJ BT21 necklace my friend gave me from Walmart.I thought Namjoon was the oldest cuz of the fanchant.I never paid the Army membership thingy so I thought I couldn\u2019t be an official Army.I tell myself that I\u2019m not gay but then Jeongyeon and Lisa exist:  I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Kai and Sehun for the longest time.I thought I would never get into any other group besides BTS or any group with over 8 members but turns out that\u2019s a \u2728lie\u2728I only started to show interest in NCT because of their tweets- I thought Got7 was a parallel universe version of Ateez. (jk but i couldn\u2019t tell the difference between them sOo o o f)I used to really hate rap until I listened to Daechwita.I sorta kinda still think JYP is creepy.I tell other people to stream this and that but have never streamed anything before in my life except Dynamite and the Duck Song.I thought Lee Know\u2019s name was a nickname and meant Lee \u2192 Knows \u2192 __I don\u2019t think aegyo is that cringey tbh unless it\u2019s forced (like fans giving their idols who are in their 20\u2019s a pacifier or bonnet is just weird) I never really understood the idea of getting super defensive over a group that doesn\u2019t know you exist unless someone is bashing your music taste. Example: fanwars.I act like I\u2019m thirsting over idols just to fit in bc simping apparently means I\u2019m a true fan or smthg? I find it creepy when someone thirsts over a man two times their age so I tend to simp over people who are like three years older at the most.I feel insulted for no reason at all whenever somebody says something offensive about K-netz.Before I got into K-pop, I thought the only company in the Korean music industry was SM and the [boss mafia] CEO was called YG.I thought Momoland and Mamamoo were the same group.I used to pronounce Tzuyu as Soo-you and then Chewy.Stray Kids and Itzy\u2019s songs are either a hit or miss for me im sowwy. I used to think(g)-idle was a junior version of f(x) bc apparently anything with parentheses is related to each other.I thought 2NE1 and Wonder Girls were the same group.And that SNSD and Girl\u2019s Generation were different groups.I thought Itzy was IZ*ONE but shortened.Ya\u2019ll I used to think that Dreamcatcher was a boy group and ikon was a girl group.I thought Bol4 was a 4 member group but found out it was a duo after they disbanded.I thought Somi and Sunmi were the same people.Welp, that\u2019s it for now. Me ded from embarrassment :D (And also keep in mind that I was only 13 when I learned about K-pop so I was really dumb. Hopefully, I got a bit less dumb.)  ~your local trash can~ ",
