            "answer_text": "Well, I know his producer is currently taking submissions from other songwriters for at least one track on an upcoming album, because my agent submitted one of mine. (It was turned down.) A lot of popular singer-songwriters record other (frequently obscure) songwriters\u2019 material, often tweaking them a little bit so they can put their name on the songs as co-writers; sometimes, the contract will actually stipulate that the song be credited to the performer alone. (Fine with me if get the royalty payments.) I don\u2019t know a lot about Mendes, but I expect he writes at least some of the material he records, maybe even the majority. But he clearly does some covers, accurately credited or otherwise. Based on the list of artists my agent submitted my latest song to, this is also the case for the group Train, Jason Mraz, Howie Day, John Mayer, Ben Harper, Gavin DeGraw, Ed Sheeran, and several other artists I honestly had never even heard of before I saw the list. For personal horn-tooting purposes, if the song gets picked up, I\u2019ll update this post. I should know by the end of July. Wish me luck! ",

            "answer_text": "According to the writing credits for his songs, he is not the only one writing them, but he likely plays a part in songwriting. A lot of pop hits are written by a group and performed by the artist. For example, the songwriter and producer Max Martin wrote a LOT of songs, including \u201cI Kissed A Girl\u201d, \u201cBlank Space\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling\u201d, \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d, and almost infinitely more. That should give you an idea of how pop musicians write songs. But remember, just because Shawn Mendez (as well as almost all of the pop musicians ever) isn\u2019t the writer of some of his songs is NOT inherently a bad thing. A lot of the time, pop singers are hired because of their vocal talent and not because they have good songwriting skills. It is very difficult to make it without all the songwriters in the industry, and a lot of really good artists sing songs written for them by other people. ",
