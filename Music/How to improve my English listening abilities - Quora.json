            "answer_text": "Many of my students find listening the most difficult English skill to master. But this is only until they try the following tips.  1. Have regular conversations with native speakers. Hearing natural English speech regularly is definitely the best way to improve your English listening. It\u2019s only through constant practice that you will get to the place you want. Speaking with native speakers will help you on many different levels. a) You will hear natural English \u2013 the way it is used in real life. b) You will learn to listen to context \u2013 to chunks of words, instead of individual words. c) It will keep your mind open to the various ways of using and hearing English, instead of solely the textbook English, which most students are used to. If you think that speaking regularly with native English speakers isn\u2019t so simple, I am telling you that it really is. Just go to English Ninjas \u2013 we have many experienced native English-speaking tutors who are ready to help you improve. Just sign up and start practicing your English as often as you want, whenever you want. Tell us that you are a Quora user, and you will get a discount!

When you are somewhat new to English and you listen to native speech on TV or the radio, everything sounds like a blur or a run-on sentence, and you think to yourself, \u201cHow am I ever going to make heads or tails out of this?\u201d But you will. You just have to stick to it, and, ideally, practice every day. I know that you are probably too busy to allocate time for English listening every single day, but try not to make it into a task. Weave it into your life in a seamless way. Listen to podcasts on topics you are most interested in as you exercise, put on an audiobook on your way to work or school, tune on to your favorite radio station as you are making breakfast, listen to English songs to relax, etc. Once you make this a daily habit, those seemingly run-on sentences will soon start making sense. 3. Listen to the same podcast several times You know how I recommended listening to podcasts in the previous point? I\u2019ll give you another tip. Try to listen to the same podcast episode every day of the week. During your first couple of days, go back to words that you don\u2019t understand and look them up in the dictionary. By the end of the week, you should be able to discern those words in the podcast and pick up the context in which they are used. This technique will develop your active listening, that is, listening during which you pay close attention to what is being said, how it is being said and make an effort to extract meaning from it.

            "answer_text": "Please be careful to use this METHOD below!! You may call it a shortcut, but you will never know how useful it is unless you have a try and stick to it. This method is also suitable for learning other languages. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ OK, first of all, let me talk about the theory of this method. There is a question: What factors are important for listening?  There are TWO factors:1. To catch the aural signals (lack of listening practice). You need to be familiar with those signals, even though you don\u2019t know the meanings. Imagine when you are a child, you listen to adults dialogue but do not know what they are talking about. Please pay attentions, being FAMILIAR with is essential. The most familiar level is that you can say or make those sounds, so you\u2019d better mimic the sounds at first. 2.You know what the signals stands for (with low listening vocabulary), that is to say you know the meaning. Learning vocabulary is of great importance. Vocabulary can be classified into four parts, Listening, Reading, Speaking and Writing. Listening Vocabulary is usually very few for a second language learner, not as much as reading vocabulary.  So, what\u2019s the method?Dictation!!! Why? Reason 1: Dictation will helps you to be familiar with words, phrases and sentences in both aural and meaning aspects. In other words you can effectively expand your listening vocabulary through dictation.Reason 2:  Dictation will improve your vocabulary and grammar knowledge, which is also benefit to your other 3 parts. In addition, you will find that fewer misspell will occur.Reason 3:  It will urge you to learning English. Dictation will help you easily to concentrate on learning. How to do it? 1.listen to a sentence with your device and then you write down what you've just heard.2.Check the passage and correct it. Please analyse the reasons why you did these errors. This is one possible analysing process.    So, use your cellphone or MP3 Player to practice DICTATION and you will make a big progress with less efforts and time. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a native English speaker who has learnt French to a high level. How I came to more or less master French can be applied to any language though. When I first arrived in Switzerland and had to interact with French-speaking people, I could barely understand two words in what seemed like a long line of random sounds issuing from their mouths. I did, however, have a good base level in French vocabulary. This is important for what followed. I started talking to French-speaking people. I had to take three times as long as I worked out what I wanted to say then translate it into French but eventually I got the words out. What I found was that people then answered me back using similar words that I could then pick out. The more I did this, the more I could understand. I also got faster at translating in my head until one day, I no longer needed to translate. I'm currently at a C1 level for written and oral expression and a C2 level for written and oral comprehension. This means that even with accents that I'm unfamiliar with I can understand if given a bit of time to adapt and familiarize myself with it. Now, you may not be in a situation where you can practice daily with a native speaker of English. If you can practice with someone, even if it's your teacher at school for the few hours a week you have class, don't miss the opportunity. The more conversation you have, the more you'll understand. However, this is not enough or you may not be in school. In that case, as a poor but better than nothing substitute, try to have as many internal dialogs as you can. Ask yourself how your day went and then answer yourself. Seek out videos and tv shows that may have this type of dialog, hit pause and see if you can answer then listen for the character\u2019s response. Did it match what you said? What did / didn't you understand? Listen again, try to respond again. If you are consistent, you should see signs of improvement. Also try reading out loud to get practice for the sound of words. Audio books that you can follow along with the actual book could also be a good way to get your ear used to the sound of words when spoken but try to choose a book with lots of dialog. Just remember that just like with any skill, practice, practice, practice. There simply is no substitute for putting in the effort. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, congratulations that you have avoided the mistake that a large proportion of language learners make, and that's to under-appreciate the importance of listening. OK, moving on, my background to this is that (other than my native English) I've learned 2 languages to fluency, and have varying levels of 4 more. I owe much of my language abilities to a focus on listening, and am such a believer in its power that I even started a podcast for English learners. So then, how to improve your listening abilities? Well, firstly we need to dissect the different 'skills' that you will need to develop to improve your listening abilities, and we can look at the ways in which you can improve each one. 1. Vocabulary Firstly, vocabulary. Quite simply, if you hear a new word you don\u2019t understand there are 2 possibilities: a) you can understand, or make a best guess at it, through context. This means that you understand the rest of the sentence, and contextually you can understand what a particular word means. b) you can\u2019t understand the word through context and need to look it up. This is fine, and completely to be expected. The only way you learn is by encountering things you don\u2019t know. In both cases, you should write down the new word. Practice repeating it in the same way that it was spoken by the native speaker (yes, speaking it will help you remember it next time you hear it), and keep it in your notebook. If you continue to do this for every new word you hear, you will find yourself having to write down fewer and fewer words, as your understanding will continually improve. 2. Grammar Similarly to vocabulary, if there is a particular grammatical form used, look it up. Write it down. Practice using it. The more you repeat this, the more familiar you will find yourself with different grammatical structures. 3. Sentence structure In any language, people do not speak in the same way in which they right. English is no exception. Not of course that he is any example of how to speak coherently, but have you ever read a transcript from Donald Trump speaking? He is an extreme example, however native speakers do not speak in the same way as they write. By familiarising yourself with the differences in speech vs. writing, you will find it easier to understand the speech of native speakers. 4. Connected speech Unlike several other languages (especially many East Asian languages), English speakers will use \u2018connected speech\u2019. In plain English, this means that when words are spoken, their pronunciation will change slightly depending on what words come before or after. You can see more examples here, but I\u2019ve put some below fish and chips (fish\u00b4n chips)a chair and a table (a chair \u00b4n a table)CanShe can speak Spanish better than I can (The first \"can\" is the weak form, the second the full form.)OfA pint of beerThat\u00b4s the last of the wine!HaveHave you finished? (weak)Yes, I have. (full)ShouldWell, you should have told me. (Both \"should\" and \"have\" are weak here)When listening with a transcript, if there is a word that changes its pronunciation due to connected speech, note that down so you will remember it for next time. 5. Auditory discrimination In plain English, this is the ability to differentiate between two sounds. For non-native speakers, it\u2019s important to be able to differentiate between phonemes, or very similar sounding sounds. For example \u2018sister\u2019 and \u2018sitter\u2019, or \u2018cat\u2019 and \u2018cot\u2019. Depending on your native language, some sounds will be harder to differentiate than others. Although you can improve these skills through contextual understanding, you should listen to audio with a transcript available, so that you can always double check the exact word if you are not sure. 6. Accent & regional differences I\u2019ve left this for last, for 2 reasons: a) If you are living in an English-speaking country or area, then you should focus on listening to conversations in the accent of the region you are in. Don\u2019t worry too much about understanding accents that you won\u2019t encounter. b) All of the above points have variations based on accent and regions. In any case, being able to recognise and understand the accents of different places can be difficult even for native speakers, and for many non-native speakers, it just isn\u2019t that necessary. If you are learning English for the purposes of living in Sydney, you shouldn\u2019t be that concerned about not being able to understand a Geordie (from Newcastle, UK) accent, as you will very rarely encounter this accent.  So, what can you actually do to improve your listening skills? 1. Active listening -> don\u2019t be a \u2018passive\u2019 listener By passive, I mean that you just let the words flow over you. Instead, as an active listener, you need to listen to every single word, every single turn of phrase that's used. Use the above points to guide you. If you're listening to a podcast, or some kind of audio that allows pausing / rewinding, use this functionality to its full potential. If you didn't understand a particular word or sentence, go back and listen again. Use audio that comes with transcripts and key vocabulary, and use that as a \u2018crutch\u2019 if you get stuck. Don\u2019t default to just reading the transcript because it\u2019s easier. 2. Transcribe -> be an \u2018ultra\u2019 active listener Although others have touched on the idea of transcribing, there are 2 major ways in which you can transcribe to help your listening. a) Transcribe the exact words that were said This will help you to make sure that you have understood every word - or at least understood how to write every word - and will help develop your sentence structure, auditory discrimination, and connected speech comprehension. b) Listen to the audio, then try to summarise what you have heard On one level this is easier, because you don\u2019t have to transcript every single word. But on another level it\u2019s harder, as you need to come up with your own words to describe what you have heard. It\u2019s more similar to \u2018real life\u2019, as in real life it\u2019s possible to skip over parts, and comprehension of the subject is more important than comprehension of a single word. Experiment with both, and you will see your listening skills develop very quickly. If you have the chance (e.g. a native speaker friend, or teacher), then show them what you have summarised and get them to check it for accuracy. 3. Don\u2019t go for the easy option Yes, this might not be what you want to hear, but normally the activities which are the most taxing and difficult will be the ways in which you learn the most effectively. For listening comprehension, many may say \u2018watch netflix\u2019, \u2018just watch videos on YouTube\u2019. Of course, this is better than nothing, but will not be the fastest way to improve. I can\u2019t stress this enough. Video is contextual, meaning that you have the film to help you understand, and you don\u2019t need to focus on the actual language. Your mind is busy processing everything else, and you aren\u2019t focussing 100% on the language. Similarly, things like listening to songs in English may seem like fun, and it\u2019s better than nothing. But your mind isn\u2019t 100% focussed on listening, PLUS the language and structures used in songs are often peculiar and don\u2019t reflect how English is actually spoken (see Will listening to English songs improve my spoken English? for a more in-depth explanation of this) 4. Carve out a set period of time and stick to it. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to \u2018decide to learn\u2019 a language. Actually creating a schedule and sticking to it is so much harder. Especially with listening, which is a skill that some people naively think can be developed just by \u2018being present and opening their ears\u2019 (see #3), you need to be religious about sticking to a schedule of active learning. This doesn\u2019t mean that you need to spend 5 hrs per day doing listening exercises, it means that you need to pick an amount of time, and make sure that you aren\u2019t falling into the trap of doing easy things that feel fun. As an example, most students will learn significantly faster by actively listening to and doing transcription exercises with a podcast for 60 mins (so a total of 1hr) than they would by watching 2 films on Netflix in English then spending an hour listening to English songs (total of 5 hrs). I know I\u2019d much rather do 1hr of intense \u2018difficult\u2019 work than 5 hours or \u2018fun and easy\u2019 work, but it just depends on you.  Learning a language isn\u2019t easy, it doesn\u2019t happen passively, and (despite what the internet may say / what you may like to hear) there aren\u2019t \u2018hacks\u2019 that mean you don\u2019t have to work at it. Best of luck in your learning journey! ",

            "answer_text": "How do I practice English listening effectively? You should understand that listening is a skill and you should train it \u2013 NOT learn it. Learning is memorizing facts about the language; training is experiencing something many times until the brain develops a skill. Driving a car, figure skating, playing a musical instrument, martial arts or speaking a foreign language or developing listening skill \u2013 all of these skills are trained, i.e. performed many times with minimal conscious effort. During training of these skills, the brain finds and records the patterns that it can perform after training without conscious effort and with minimal attention, i.e. effortlessly. There is another reason why adults have difficulties in developing speaking or listening skills: the native language comes to dominate the linguistic map space and all incoming information must be translated into the mother tongue to become understandable. This phenomenon is known as \u201cThe Tyranny of the Mother Tongue.\u201d Most adults, when learning a foreign language, subconsciously revert to cross-translation to and from their mother tongue. Cross-translation is the main barrier most teachers and educators ignore. When you cross-translate, you think in your native language while trying to speak in a foreign language or listening to the recording in English or conversation. It is very stressful and is the main reason why you need to develop listening skills. I have developed and patented the method that stops cross-translation automatically. You need to perform simultaneous training of reading, listening and speaking skills. When learner performs simultaneous repetition, his natural habit of thinking in the native language is turned off automatically. This tool allows adult learners to automatically form direct wiring between English words and images or symbols, they describe. Learners start thinking in English from the first lesson.

            "answer_text": "Lots of good advice here. Basically, as with any skill you want to improve, it takes practice. Luckily, there are many ways to practice your listening skills nowadays. YouTube and other sites have many videos you can watch, often with subtitles. Use them , and pay close attention to what you\u2019re listening to. Watch movies in English, listen to English broadcasts. One can also download books with audio, so that you can hear books read to practice listening to them. One can often listen to the audio and read along to practice matching the spoken word to the word you see written. Bit by bit, you should find it getting easier and easier to follow. There are many available free or for a negligible price (I\u2019ve downloaded free books and audio onto a Kindle on my smartphone, others I\u2019ve downloaded for only 99 cents.) Find English speakers to talk to. Conversing with other people in English means you have to listen to them. That way you can practice listening and speaking skills together. But again, it\u2019s all about practice, practice, practice. Good luck! ",

In general - we need to listen to improve our listening skill. :) I would suggest this: depending on your level of English start listening to easy materials - cartoons, children movies - and then gradually move to something more challenging like audio books for young adults, teens. But as I said - depending on your level - if your English is much better, start with normal audio books for example. :)use subtitles and transcripts while listening. But be careful - many subtitles which are available freely on internet are full of mistakeslisten to internet radios, e g. BBC - iPlayer Radio Choose your favourite station and enjoyNice podcasts: Elementary podcasts (British Council)Effortless English PodcastSpeak English With Misterduncan (not a podcast, but great youtube channel; there are correct subtitles included in every video :) )See more ideas in my other related answers: Ivan Ottinger's answer to How can I improve my English online?Ivan Ottinger's answer to How can I improve my spoken English?Or look at my blog where I discuss English learning tips: English & LanguagePlease do let me know how you like these tips in the comment or by Upvote. :) Thank you!

If you want to improve your listen skills in English you have to practice, in this case you have to listen. Listen to anything, listen to everything. Listen to recordings geared to your vocabulary level. I want you to listen to common conversations. Listen to children\u2019s stories. I recommend that you repeat videos or audios many times until you understand what they are saying. Read the transcripts many times and even memorize much of them. As you get better you won\u2019t need to use transcripts much. You can move on to news on audio or in video. You Tube has so much info that you would err gravely in not using the materials you find there. Many language learning sites include podcasts which may be perfect for your quest to improve your English language listening skills. Don\u2019t give up until you are satisfied with your level and even then keep working to improve ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, The following tips might be helpful. 1. Listen to audio books (by native speakers) while you read the e-book for the same audio-book. I specifically recommend audio-books and not videos because, at least for the IELTS test, watching videos might get you into wrong practice. When you watch videos, you follow the lip movements of the speaker. It acts as a visual cue and it helps you understand the accent. If you get yourself into the practice of \u2018watching\u2019 English rather than \u2018listening\u2019 to it, you might suffer in the IELTS listening test, as there are no videos in it. So it\u2019s only advisable to train your ears more than your eyes to understand English. Link to the audio-book for Alice in Wonderland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJHBtOu5aX0 2. Read eBooks while you listen to audio books. The eBooks will play the role of the subtitles and help you understand the pronunciation of unfamiliar words and also expose you to correct spoken English. Link to the eBook for Alice in Wonderland - https://www.adobe.com/be_en/active-use/pdf/Alice_in_Wonderland.pdf 3. Listen to radio/ news in English. It will help you gain a wide range of vocabulary and will also train your ears to listen well. 4. Listen subconsciously; set aside some time to listen to correct spoken English subconsciously. Plug in your ear phones and continue with your daily chores. Even if you are not able to concentrate on the audio, your subconscious mind is receptive and continues to learn to listen and understand. You will be amazed at how fast you learn through this technique 5. Educate yourself about different accents. The IELTS listening test audios use a variety of accents. Get acquainted with differences of pronunciation in different accents. For e.g. The word \u2018leisure\u2019 is pronounced differently in the American and in the British English - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCvTLNRqFag 6. Enroll yourself in a course. To avail professional help you might want to consider hiring a trainer. As an IELTS trainer I have seen many students benefit from the customized approach of the following organisation https://ieltsninja.com/course/intense-listening-preparation/ . They provide you with reliable listening resources, expert trainers, assessments and intensive training. ",

Especially BBC because you should get used to British English.)Podcasts! Listen different kind of podcasts.Watch some cartoons.

Are they actually being mean or are you percieving it as them being mean? Can you give more detail to your personal story and explain why you are feeling this way? In any case, i can understand the thoughts and hurt feelings behind people that you love and care about treating u less than ideal. There could be a number of reasons why. It could range from their character,culture or religion to maybe you did something that you are unaware of. Have you spoke to them? I am very sorry that you are feeling hurt. ",

            "answer_text": "To improve your listening skills, you should focus on activities that require you to listen. One great way of doing this is by finding audio files that also have transcripts (a written version of the audio). One great source is the US news agency NPR. Here is how you can find audio and matching transcripts from their website: Go to the NPR website: Home Page Top StoriesSelect a story with an audio file: Stories with audio files will have a \u201clisten\u201d button. 3. Click on the article\u2019s headline, and you will be taken to another page:  4. Look for the button that says \u201ctranscript\u201d, located to the left of the article. This will provide you with an exact text of the audio file that you have chosen to listen to. Now, you can listen to the story and read along with it. This is a free, effective way to practice listening, and it will also help familiarize you with a wide variety of English accents spoken throughout the United States. Try following this pattern for practice: Listen to the audio once, without reading the transcript.Read over the transcript in detail. Underline new vocabulary words and phrases or idioms that you aren\u2019t familiar with.Look up as many of these vocabulary words as you can.Listen to the audio again, while reading the transcript. Pay attention to how words are pronounced.Hope this helps. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Listen to the radio. I like NPR, but you can listen to anything with lots and lots of talk. It doesn\u2019t have to be one of those \u201cLearn English\u201d radio sessions; it can pretty much be anything as long as it\u2019s talk and not music. What I like about the radio is that you get a lot of different voices going on, people from different places with different accents talking generally at a bit faster than conversational speed, so it kind of gets you used to everything. And that\u2019s great, because even if you don\u2019t understand everything they\u2019re saying, your brain retains a lot of information semi-consciously and familiarizes you with certain sounds, etc. You also get to reinforce a lot of the stuff you already know. It\u2019s great if you want to repeat what they say to yourself, too, that helps with remembering things and gives you a feel for how those words are pronounced, which gives you a better chance of remembering how they sound like. Anyway, I hope this helped. Good luck on your English endeavors! ",

This is the best part I like about GrammarlyGrammarly has got one small con too. Grammarly has been disabled by Quora :( So Grammarly is not available on Quora, rest on all platforms it works fineFor Thesaurus, I use Power thesaurus tool. And I use Vocable to learn new words each day Learn more about these here: Tools to Improve Communication in English3) Speaking: This is the most important form of communication, and also the most toughest. Speaking fluent English requires confidence and the capability to pronounce the words without grammatical mistakes. Listen more, read more and imitate more.Watch English movies with subtitles to listen the way words are pronounced and the tone and expressionsTry to imitate how Hollywood Actors deliver the dialogues. Try to copy them. Copying something good this is no bad!Try to listen to simple English songs. Try to sing them. This will help You with flowEach day pick one Rap song( best by Eminem, Drake) look online for the lyrics of that song. Now simultaneously listen the song and read the lyrics. Repeat it now without any media. Do this for a while, You will observe English speaking has improved a-lot!Speaking24 is one good website to talk someone in English, if at your home you have no one to practice English speaking with youResource: Online Tools to Improve English4) Listening: This isn\u2019t tough thing. In the beginning you need to listen to slow conversations. Over and over you will improve and very soon you will be able to catch the lightening fast conversations. Listen carefully, with all your attentionTry to put eye contact on lips( in-case of humanoid conversation) to assist you in better communicationListen to podcasts, radio for a better grasp on practical englishUse TuneIn Radio to access millions of channels and podcasts across world These tricks helped me a lot. And they will you too, as you keep on doing it. Be sure you will not be perfect in just one night. So don\u2019t feel down after a day or two. Just keep on repeating. Also to everyone who laughs on you because you are learning, one day your fluency will give a slap on their faces. So keep practicing and keep doing good. All the best. Thanks for your time.

            "answer_text": " The way to become a better listener? Practice active listening. This is where you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, try to understand the complete message being sent. In order to do this, you must pay attention to the other person very carefully. You cannot allow yourself to become distracted by whatever else may be going on around you, or by forming counter-arguments that you'll make when the other person stops speaking. Nor can you allow yourself to get bored, and lose focus on what the other person is saying. All of these contribute to a lack of listening and understanding. Related post: Communications are Key to Building Customer Trust There are five key elements of active listening. They all help you ensure that you hear the other person and that the other person knows you are hearing what they say. Listen carefully Give the speaker your undivided attention, and acknowledge the message. Recognize that non-verbal communication also \"speaks\" loudly. Defer Judgment Interrupting is a waste of time. It frustrates the speaker and limits a full understanding of the message. Respond Appropriately Active listening is a model for respect and understanding. You are gaining information and perspective. You add nothing by attacking the speaker or otherwise putting him or her down. Show That You're Listening Use your own body language and gestures to convey your attention. Provide Feedback Our personal filters, assumptions, judgments, and beliefs can distort what we hear. As a listener, your role is to understand what is being said. This may require you to reflect what is being said and ask questions. It is really very simple. Demonstrate that you're listening. Paraphrase, re-state and react to what you hear. Ask for clarification. Get involved. Mike Schoultz is the founder of Digital Spark Marketing , a digital marketing and customer service agency.

            "answer_text": "I have two tips. I discovered the first one accidentally- on some podcast programs, there is an option to either speed up or slow down the speech. Find a podcast on a topic you are interested in, and listen to it slowed down. Don\u2019t stress about understanding each and every word, just listen to it to understand the big ideas. Then listen again at full speed. You\u2019ll understand more and more. The other tip I have recommended for a long time- anytime you are watching a movie or video, turn on the closed-captioning in English. Your brain will read and listen and look at the body language and other visuals all at the same time. This holistic viewing will improve listening- since you understand what is going on in the movie, you will improve listening as well. You can follow up by watching the movie again without the captions. Using subtitles in your native language, or on a dubbed movie or animated movie doesn\u2019t work nearly as well- you want to use all the options in English (or other target language) so you are reading lips and facial expressions, reading the words and hearing the words all at the same time.

            "answer_text": "There are a few techniques that I\u2019ve found very useful for my students. A very popular method is to watch DVDs in English with the English sub-titles on. Some people suggest leaving the sub-titles off, in order to force students to think in English. In my experience, this doesn\u2019t work. If you don\u2019t yet have the vocabulary to understand what people are saying, it\u2019s pointless to guess. Sub-titles provide a lot of valuable information. You can use the pause button to stop the DVD if the audio is going too fast and replay - this also gives you the opportunity to polish your pronunciation by copying unfamiliar words. One of the biggest problems with DVDs, however, is the speed at which actors speak, making it very hard to follow. Movie scripts also tend to be full of idioms, many of which are hard for English learners to understand. Because of this, I use a lot of TED talks for listening comprehension in my classes. There are thousands of these available online on a huge variety of topics - all free! What\u2019s great about TED talks is that every one of them has a transcript so you can follow what the speaker is saying. I usually copy and paste the transcript onto a Word document, print it out and have students read it along with the speaker. Of course, TED speakers also talk at a very fast pace, but there is less idiomatic speech and less action and drama than you will find in a movie, so overall these talks are much easier to follow and understand. Finally there are a couple of great listening resources available here in Australia but they do cost money. AMES Australia produces 2 CDs which are called \u2018That\u2019s Life\u2019 and \u2018That\u2019s Work\u2019. They have dozens of excellent listening activities on a very wide range of subjects. The CDs cost about $80 Australian each and I think they ship overseas. ",

            "answer_text": "Agh... Songs. If you are familiar with an adult cartoon series \"Family Guy\", you should watch one where they make fun of the singer Sting and how most of native English speakers, mind you, perceive his singing. It goes something like this: \"samustanu simastanu blah blah blah blah fields of gold\". Of course, in the cartoon, it sounds much funnier (here's the link to YouTube video   ). So, do not beat yourself up for not understanding some singers. I feel exactly the same about Adam Lavine from Maroon 5 and I'm an English teacher:-) I understand probably 50% of his songs. On a serious note, however, if you really want to understand a singer better, I would suggest looking for his/her songs' lyrics and reading them while listening to their singing. This way, you'll be familiar with their way of pronouncing the words in the song.  In general, more TV watching and radio listening will improve your listening skills. If you have a favorite subject in university or just a hobby, you can find a lot of podcasts online on those subjects. You can't see people's lips while listening to a podcast or a radio show and this will encourage you to concentrate more and try to understand what word they pronounced while connecting those words to the rest of the sentence. The more you listen, the more you'll understand different ways of speaking and different accents. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, listening to English is going to be the best way for you to get used to the sounds and the intonation of this beautiful language. You might enjoy listening to English radio, podcasts, or music. Or, for enhanced English listening practice, watch  TV, YouTube videos, movies, and series with subtitles on. This is a great way to immerse yourself in the language. Find material that interests you and you will train your ear with repetitive listening. You can use ListenPal Liteas a support tools. This app divide a video into many sections & play each section to practice listening skill, you can search videos on Youtube, then add them to playlist. Let's choose some topic/channel that you like, I recomment you some good channels: - TED - In A Nutshell - Every Frame A Painting - Extra Credits - MinutePhysics - Mental Floss  Beside, you should make time to practice conversation with your English speaking friend in-person or online via Skype. When you are talking, you must process what you\u2019ve heard and respond within a relatively short time frame. Over time, your comprehension of spoken English will improve dramatically, and you will gain confidence in your new language skills. For more info: Practice English Listening   ",

I watched a v. good episode over & over again, understanding not a single word, but getting the satisfaction of knowing partially what was going on via tonal expression, facial & vocal, & loving how it was filmed. Finally, after about my 13th time watching it, I suddenly heard the actress Hannelore Hoger, who plays the Kommisarin Bella Block, say the German word \"Sicher?\", meaning \"Sure?\" You cannot imagine how thrilled I was! Watching it yet again, I recognised at least 5 words or expressions, & before long, a few months, I was understanding more & more of what was being said. ",

I remember after my training go over I was sent to the production area to generate revenue for my organization. During my first interaction I couldn\u2019t understand 90% of what the client said. It was really humiliating. The day went on. I spoke to more people mostly Americans. I struggled to comprehend their accent. It was a bad first day at work. I had to ask almost every client to speak slow which was very inconvenient for some of them as they were pressed for time. I went home and I wondered what happened and why. I used to watch Hollywood movies all the time and I never thought talking in person would be so different. However over a period of time my ear got used to all the different kinds of accents in The United States. We are all born with the ability to listen. It\u2019s about how sharp we can become and it happens over a period of time by listening to a lot of English and a variety of accents too. You could do that by watching a lot of movies and TV shows. Focus more on what they are saying and how they are saying it. There are many apps that help you make English Comprehension better too. Please find a good source. Hope it helps! ",

So spoken or written English is easy provided you have the fire in you to learn it. Learn minimum two words per day with the complete knowledge of where,when and how to use them in sentences. Choosing a right word, in the right place and in the right context will enrich the language. It cannot happen over night but you can surely achieve this over a period of time. Good luck. ",

They tend to shout less than their angst-ridden conservative counterparts on AM radio, and if you aren't a native speaker of English, you're less likely to be insulted by their closed-minded attitudes towards immigration and non-English or non-Americans in general. Many of my Latino friends tell me they learned A LOT from television. That makes sense to me. English tends to get \"slushy\" when spoken.  For example (depending upon where & who you are in the US) ... \"Did you eat?\" becomes \"Ja-eet?\" (almost one syllable) \"I'm going to\" becomes\"Ahm gonna\" \"I don't know\" becomes\"Ahdunno.\" It's VERY difficult! Believe me; I speak other languages besides English. It's not easy LISTENING versus READING.  In French? I can muddle through READING it, but I am virtually illiterate if my life depended on WRITING you a note. I could shop & chat, though!  Hope this helps.  :-) ",

They struggled for months, but after about a year of immersion they realized that they were able to understand pretty much everything spoken to them and eventually became fully fluent. ",

We cannot hope to improve our listening ability unless we just listen to more English-language stuff. Then listen widely -- this means listening to a wide or wider range of speaking. Then listen 'differently' -- this means listening to stuff that you wouldn't normally listen to. Add all three above together (\"more, widely, differently\") and the result is a greater understanding and skills in handling the different \"textures\" of operation of spoken English. In a perfect world, you would also help yourself by listening to graded audio -- audio that are designed for listening at certain proficiency levels. These audio recordings may come with subtitles or workbooks, and are generally produced by academic publishers. ",

Listen to things that interest you. If you don't enjoy something, it's going to be hard for you to continue. You'll get bored and stop.  Interactive listening is best. In other words, it's better to talk with someone than just to listen to a recorded TV show, radio program, or podcast. When you talk to people live, you listen more carefully, and you also think about how you're going to respond.Don't just listen to the same kind of English all the time. Don't just listen to the news, or only watch TV comedies. Expose yourself to a variety of different kinds of situations and topics.Try listening Prefer English captions to subtitles in your native language. When you read subtitles in your language, it keeps your brain locked into \"native language mode\". English subtitles are good, though. They help you to match words that you know with their natural pronunciations.",

Assuming understanding English accents is a priority and you have enough time to watch TV series and movies over again, I suggest you watch them without subtitles. If you are watching them on your computer (anywhere other than TV) you could rewind and watch (and listen again) if you did not understand it the first time you heard it. You could watch the episodes/movies which you have already watched with subtitles for the second time, and this time without subtitles. Don't go ahead till you understand what the actors are saying. You could search Youtube for some comedy acts which mock different accents. It's fun to watch and you will learn something too.  For eg.    PS:1. There are a lot of references to celebrities, news, occurrences which are household in the US or the UK, but not in India. You need not worry if you don't understand what they're saying, even if you heard it for the 10th time! 2. A surprising number of Indians are comfortable with comprehending American accent and feel that it is a completely new language when it comes to British accent. This mainly is because of the sheer number of TV series, movies and songs that come out of the US. ",

            "answer_text": "Unlike in the reading and writing parts of the test, you are not in control of the timing of the listening test so it is vital that you use the time you are given before and after each section of the test to read the questions and check your answers. Make predictions about possible answers and type of word or words (noun, verb, adjective or numbers etc) the answer might contain before each listening section. After each section go back over your answers to check you have not made any simple mistakes. However, if you are very confident about your answers, you might want to use that checking the time to go to the next section to prepare for that instead. Highlight/circle/underline the keywords in the questions/diagrams etc. Make sure you follow the order of the questions in tables (top to bottom or left to right?) and diagrams (clockwise, anticlockwise or dotted around?) and understand what information is required and/or what the diagram/process is showing. Many candidates spend a lot of time practicing for the IELTS listening test by doing old tests from test books. This is obviously a good idea as it helps make the test more familiar. However, repeated practice of just one test type will not improve your general listening skills very much and you need to take time with other listening sources as well. Try using a graded reader: listen to it in small chunks and write what you hear, checking back for spelling and grammatical accuracy. Use the internet to listen to BBC news items making notes on what you hear. Listen again (with or without subtitles) to check your information. TED talks are another very good source of detailed practice for the IELTS listening test. For section one you need to be sure you know the English alphabet and how each letter is pronounced in spelling words such as people\u2019s names and place names. Also, you will hear information given in numerical form. This information is simple but can be given quite rapidly so do some practice with phone numbers, prices, time and dates, percentages, fractions etc. Section two of the IELTS listening test contains general information given as a monologue. To practice in advance you need to listen to instructions, tour guides and the like. Sometimes this involves a map so practice with language of directions (north, south, next to, behind, opposite etc). Section three is an academic discussion, often between students and a tutor. This might involve language of decision making, giving reasons and opinions especially in the area of choosing courses, study topics and reviewing assignments.  ",

            "answer_text": "Is English nit your original language? Assuming so, there are many ways and you can try many. The easiest ways are to watch a variety of \u201cmainstream\u201d tv shows, news shows, movies, documentaries, etc. where you can see several things at one time: 1) the context of the words accompanied by facial and body gestures for nuance, ANDDo he following things AT THE SAME TIME: have the \u201cSUBTITLES\u201d setting in in English so you can read at the same time for further nuance: English she has many words that should alike or are spelled differently but have different meanings, or many words that are spelled differently but that mean the same thing.3. You can also \u201cwatch\u201d and read subtitles at the same time BUT in your own language for a general idea about \u201cwhat is taking place in \u201cthe story or content\u201d and then listen to the English version over and over. (And practice repeating.) [The reason for \u201cmainstream watching\u201d to learn English is that you would have less likelihood of picking up slang or swearing or truncated ways of talking, such as in texting.] 4. You can also get a book and read it aloud while taping it and then slow down the playback. 5. Similarly, you can buy an audio book and the same in \u201chard copy\u201d or on a screen and read along while listening. 6. Similarly, you can turn on audio of a book on screen and read along while listening. 7. Finally: join classses of people learning English language or other groups and practice English sh. You can ask people to speak more slowly. 8. Always try not to have other distractions, such as music playing. 9. Also when you can, get close enough ( without being creepy or invading someone\u2019s space) and tell them that you\u2019d like to practice your English and ask whether you may followed w words along by watching their lips. Ideally, the person you ask about this should be a friend, family member or someone you know well. ",

Try watching English movies without using subtitles and listen to an English radio station. You'll soon notice that your listening skills will drastically improve. Another good exercise is to watch BBC worldwide news. You probably won't understand every single word they say but since they generally bring news on a global scale you'll be able to interpret a lot of what they are saying.That's a very good way to improve your listening skills and even learn new words.

You will improve your listening skills if the vocabulary and structures is not much above or below your level. \"Immersion\" is not the key. It's the type of immersion. When you listen, three things may happen: a) You don't understand much of what they say (the level is too high for you). b) You already know what they say (the level is too low for you). c) You don't understand some of the things they say but the level and the way the content is presented allows you to infer the meaning of new words (recommended setting).

Hear means that sounds come into your ears whether you want it or not, while listen means that you consciously pay attention to what you hear, that is you want to hear something.

Don\u2019t let your own thoughts divert you from what is being talked about.Read as you listen.Listen for the specific information you want.Don\u2019t worry if there is a word you do not understand; you may not need to use it.Don\u2019t write the answer too quickly.Be careful with your spelling & grammar.Attempt all questions; there are no penalties for incorrect answers.Good Luck !

My listening skills improved rather quickly after I listened to BBC radio for about 9 months while keeping the midnight watch on a ship, used to make notes of the news and pin it on the notice board so the crew could read it when they came for breakfast. The need to write down coherently made me listen harder till it became automatic and to some extent boring. I could grasp quicker and more easily the dialogues of Hollywood movies after this exercise. There are a lot of other benefits from listening so keenly: you get a live demo of good English, good wordplay, the correct pronunciation, ways of addressing, various accents, so many things spoken live and extempore.

            "answer_text": "Certainly we can practice listening, and especially with different accents.But none of this will help you immediately. However here are two tips, that will help you even today for the rest of your life.Firstly why not simply ask for your speaking partner to change their accent and speed of speaking, to match your current level of understanding?If you can do this for your first language, then why not for English. Don't feel ashamed to ask!You can speak two languages, but perhaps your counterpart is only monolingual. You have spent years learning English, but perhaps the other person has made no such effort. Think of the famous quote: 'A foreign accent is a sign of courage'.Secondly consider Globish. Globish is a simplified form of English, that expects especially  the native speaker, to adjust their English to the level of their partner's English.Using the term 'Globish' is a way to make people much more conscious of their language. For native speakers they can't then assume that they know how to speak. In other words they will have to be more conscious in their speech. This will be helpful for you.All of this requires your growing confidence in your identity as a speaker of English.As a citizen of the world you have the right to access to English as your international language.Own this right!Take control of a conversation; manage it. Don't feel ashamed of your English!In the end it's all about successful shared understanding, right?If you need more advice then sign up to the newsletter on www.effectiveINenglish.com ",

            "answer_text": "I think the key word here is 'practice' Xu Jinwei. Much also depends on where you live and the access you have to people and resources who can support you. Online, if you search, for example, 'English listening resources online' a range of options will come up. The best options are things you can have recorded or record/save yourself, and then play back, repeating as often as you need. If you have access to a native English speaker also who can assist with finer points like pronunciation, intonation and vocabulary, then this is a bonus. Not all native speakers will have the capacity to do this, however, as it does imply a certain capacity to listen and teach as well as having a fluent grasp of English in the first place. Listening to things like news broadcasts is also useful as you can hear different accents: BBC, CNN, ABC,  TVNZ etc. I do know people with a remarkable grasp of English, learned from watching hours of English-speaking TV! Just be aware that there are so many variations of English accent, both within nations and generally as separate nations. Also, local slang is another challenge, especially in Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand, Australian, Canadian, UK, Scottish, Irish, South African, US accents - for example - are widely variable and then there are regional variations within each country. I guess, also, you might want to decide on the best English 'accent' for you and which to have as a goal. This might be a personal preference you have already sorted out. Hope this helps and my sincere best wishes!! ",

            "answer_text": "Listen more, of course! Movies or TV shows are great for listening skill. They use everyday conversation, probably some English terms related to your expertise at work as well. Watch English language TV shows or movies with English subtitles, after some time, you can try to remove the subtitle as well. Sure you may not be able to understand or catch every word, but if you get the general idea of what a person is talking about, then you already succeeded. Youtube videos work too! Don't watch the educational English channel on Youtube, watch vloggers' video, or game review if you're into gaming, gadget review if you're into tech stuff, etc. It works wonders! Another alternative would be to speak with a native speaker, obviously. Listening to songs also helps, but you might get confused sometimes. When I was still bad at listening I would listen to slow-medium paced songs and write down the lyric, rewind it again and again to catch the word and then double check by checking the real lyric on the internet. It's harder though and more recommended for intermediate-advance listeners. ",

Instead of doing that, try to focus completely on what the person is saying.

Because radio is nothing visual, it would force your hearing to obtain all the information. For example, if you watch a movie and you don't understand what the characters are saying. You can understand the movie, because the images.  3- talk to people in English. Everybody has different way to talk; tone of voices, accents, ect. This can help you challenge your hearing.   4- use the app \"Google translate\". You can listen the pronunciation of words with this app.  5- well, now hard work. A lot of people know how to accomplish their goals. However, they don't spend time working on them. ",

Search for listening tests on line, there are models for IELTS and TOEFL. Keep taking them, it helps. Also train yourself to listen to videos and movies, don't depend on subtitles. Gradually speed them, start with the ones you\u2019ve already listened to before. Pay attention to how they pronounce, how they drop some sounds \u2026 etc. Train yourself to take the sample test within the right time, or less, because in the real one an extra minute could make a difference. Train yourself to forget about any question you've missed, thinking about the last point will only make you lose the current. At the end of the whole test, don't leave any questions unanswered, there is a chance if you picked the same choice( between: a, b, c, d) that 25 percent of them could be right. Before the test be calm take deep breath three times at least, and concentrate. Good luck! ",

Watch English films or TV with English subtitles, if this is available. 3.  One word: karaoke :)  (If you like to sing, or like English music) 4.  When you listen to a recording for which you have a printed text-- a story, a news broadcast, poem, song, etc.-- visualize the printed words in your mind as you listen.  When you find you can't do this easily, find out what words you didn't recognize, write them down, say them aloud.  Then listen again. 5.  Try Shadowing.   ",

Listening to somebody in English , a foreign language is more challenging.You must learn English well enough, extend your vocabulary, attune your ear to the English pronunciation, intonation, elisions, idioms, slang words and so on. Unfortunately, these days only a small number of speakers and listeners/writers know their native tongues well http://enough.My advice is that you must respect your own language: learn it well, and then learn a foreign language. There is such a thing as language learning capacity. Another thing is your culture, your environment, reading material easily available, and above all your personal interest and effort and personality. ",

This is necessary just because you can check your comprehension when you listen to something new.

Here are some ideas to improve your Listening Skills: The first step in this method is to simply listen to the audio aloneTry and find different ways to practice your English skills. For this, Don\u2019t just read English; speak it and also Listen to it!

You only listen to your English teacher and specific listening exercises. This is a great start but does not prepare you for the real world. In the real world people speak quickly, mumble, use bad grammar, use slang words and local expressions, have accents from different places. When you listen to English in the real world you may be in a noisy environment, or trying to do something at the same time as listening. These are the skills you need to practise. If you don\u2019t live in an English speaking country you need to spend time, Watching English TV. (Not just from the US) try looking for a New Zealand soap opera or a South African documentary.Listening to English radio. Can you understand your favourite musician when they talk to the audience between songs?Watch YouTube. While a lot of YouTube is (semi)professional there are a lot of videos made by normal people from all over the world. You\u2019ll see some amazing things and hear some crazy accents\u2026",

Try to find as many movies and shows as possible with the same dialect so that you won't be thrown off by the difference between a Bronx accent, a Georgia accent, and a Cockney accent (or worse, an American trying to portray a Cockney accent). The value of watching movies and TV shows over listening to the radio or similar audio-only media is that you will have visual cues to help you put what you are hearing in context. By turning off subtitles you are forced to actually listen to what is being said and learn not just the individual words but the rhythm and flow of the speech as well. ",

If you can, download it and play it SLOWER (VLC player allows this.)You say what YOU thought it was, then look to your Guide for Yes/No.If No again, your Guide shares what is ACTUALLY being said, and may even write it out for you. Repeat, for 40 minutes, break, then 40 minutes again. Will this eat time? Yes. Will it deliver positive results? YES!!

Maybe find a TV news program that has captions so you can follow the text at the same time. This should improve your understanding as well as your pronunciation. ",

Listening to some information stream be it podcast, video, or music could be quite boring if you're not interested, that's why it's important that you listen for the sake of the information and not for the sake of listening.  For example, if you're a student - listen related courses and watch video from sources like iTunes University, coursera.org, or any other (there are tons of resources, depending on what you want to learn). If you're already working, maybe there are professional skills you want to improve, eg: presentation skills, sales, etc. Find the materials related to this topic. On any topic, there are plenty. ",

Make anything you do related to learning English a regular part of your schedule and stick with it. The other thing is extremely helpful is immersion. If you can find an environment in which English is being spoken visit regularly. It will help if the focus of that environment is something you enjoy and are familiar with. This might include gaming, Restaurants, laundromats, grocery stores, or any place where something is taking place that allows you to see the item and the name together so that you are mediately aware of meanings. Set aside time regularly to immerse yourself in this environment. If you are unable to do this because of your schedule or for some other reason pick a television show you are familiar with and see if you can get it in English. Watching it will help you connect situations and objects with the appropriate words in English. I have occasionally made use of live translation programs. Upon hearing a sentence in any language they can be set to translate to your language. This link will show you some possibilities and many of them are free. Best translation apps for iPhone: iTranslate Voice, iVoice, Google Translate, and more! There are equivalents for android operating systems so if you have either you might wish to try this. These programs are not perfect but they are certainly helpful. ",

His solution? He meets weekly with various native English speakers and just talks to them about anything and everything. He's found that it helps him understand colloquialisms and a variety of accents.  If this is not a possibility for you, I'd really encourage you to make use of television, films and radio programs in English. In my opinion, the best way to build comprehension is to listen a lot and build understanding from context. And both conversation and media can help you with this. ",

With listening it\u2019s even more important, because listening is a skill that requires your careful attention. Here are three main types of learning situations: Classroom setting: A classroom will have other students with a teacher, and meets regularly. This might be for you if you like discussing with other students, feel uncomfortable alone with a teacher, or have trouble focusing on your own.One-on-one: One-on-one classes are sessions with you and a teacher (or a conversation partner). You might prefer these lessons if you feel shy around other students or if it\u2019s easier to ask questions to a teacher or conversation partner privately (alone).Independent study: Independent means \u201cby yourself,\u201d so this involves studying English on your own time. You might like this option if you can get distracted by others in a classroom, are too busy for a formal class, or prefer to study in different places (on a train, at home, at a park) whenever you can.",

Also YouTube films can be useful, although you need to be sure that the English is ok (so use film and tv clips from English speaking countries). I\u2019ve also used songs a lot, although maybe less suitable for listening practice per se (I use them for teaching grammar mostly and because it\u2019s easier to remember songs because of the melody). A lot of my students can remember phrases in a song much easier than when they see it written down. I used the sub-title off thing myself when I was learning French and German, because I was trying to tune into the sound of the language. The melody of a language is important if you want to sound natural when speaking. I also learned that I could understand a lot of what was happening without understanding every word -a useful life lesson. Language is important, but other things such as body language, intuition, how you feel around someone etc can be drowned out by words. Something to bear in mind. Lastly, it\u2019s important to listen to lots of different accents. English is so varied that you need that. ",

The trick is to put yourself into such conditions where you are required to use the language daily.  I didn't become fluent in English until I went for a PhD to Germany, where English was the working language (of science). Despite me attending English courses in Russia for almost 10 years (though they helped to get started). So, the best thing you can do to learn English is to arrange yourself a study or a job in an English-speaking country. But learn some basics before that. If that's too much for you, find some native English speakers where you live, become friends with them. What also helped me to practice my English listening abilities: watching YouTube, movies (first with, then without subtitles), listening to songs. The good news are: it gets easier and easier as you practice. Most importantly, enjoy the process! ",

But having a command over listening to english isn't that difficult.If you follow the following steps: 1.Listen to TED talks-India This would be the first step for improving your listening ability since the accent of indian speakers is not too \u2018strong\u2019 and you will understand most of the words they utter throughout the speech. Choose the topic of the talks as per your interest, but I recommend you should listen to variety of topics. Listen to the speech again and again. Some of the ted talk links that might be helpful are here.. 7 Ways to Make a Conversation With Anyone | Malavika Varadan | TEDxBITSPilaniDubai Broken English: Every Indian Kid's Ordeal | Esha Manwani | TEDxHLCC It is okay not to have a plan | Mithila Palkar | TEDxNITSilchar 2.Listen to Podcasts. Most efficient way of grooming your English skills is podcasts. Just by listening to the podcast not only do you train your ear for listening but also come across new words and improve pronunciation. Podcasts have been very helpful for me. First podcast that I had listened was from British Council. You can also download free podcast apps. 3.Listen to TED talks of Native English speakers By this time, you would have been used to listening slow and easy-to-understand English. Now it's time to step forward a bit. Try listening to native speakers\u2019 TED talks speech.They might give you irritation at first, I know, and you might want to quit listening, may be dumb the whole plan of improving English skills but trust me it will seem hard at first, In the beginning, you will get half of the sentences they speak (though I understood 90% of what they spoke about) but as you continue listening to them, you yourself will feel the difference. Some of my favourite TED talks that you may listen to are Stop Waiting for Life to Happen | Peter Sage | TED Talk How to motivate yourself to change your behavior | Tali Sharot | TEDxCambridge Get comfortable with being uncomfortable | Luvvie Ajayi The virginity fraud | Nina D\u00f8lvik Brochmann & Ellen St\u00f8kken Dahl | TEDxOslo 4.Watch ROMCOMS You might be thinking why I put this on number four, it should be the first or second step, as some people advise watching Shows like Friends, for English listening skills. No doubt English shows are extremely important for improving listening abilities but not for the beginners. They might lost the plot, miss the hilarious jokes and sometimes get bored. So, only after going through the first three steps, you, now need to watch ROMCOMS like Friends, The two and a half man, Will and Grace, The Big bang theory etc. First with subtitles then without it. Watch one episode at one time repeatedly. 5. Listen English Songs Who doesn't enjoy listening to English songs. whether we understand their lyrics or not,we all have been fond of them. Most of the time we listen to English Songs for good music but this time why not listen to them for improving English listening skills. Of course you will stuck at first or second word of the song. Quite normal it is. Don't worry if you see the lyrics first and then listenthis Again and again. Try humming the words simultaneously. 6.Try Audiobooks This step is not mandatory. You can try it or not it totally depends on your choice. Nevertheless, you should give it a try. Audiobooks help. 7. Follow spiritual and religious gurus on YouTube I've been listening to the khutbas (Religious speech delivered to people before prayer) of Nauman Ali Khan and Mufti Ismail Menk for two years. These are the western preachers and really amazing at their work. If you are interested in Islam then you might also listen to them. I've provided the links. Abuse of Women - Nouman Ali Khan - Malaysia Tour 2015 Light Up Your Heart - Khutbah by Nouman Ali Khan Knowledge is Key - Nouman Ali Khan - Malaysia Tour 2015 8.The Daily Shows Watching the daily show with Trevor Noah will surely give your learning a boost. You will be mesmerised by the results when you will start laughing at his jokes without even realising it. 9.Repeat the steps. Repeat the steps randomly. Notice your weak points and work on them. If you see no further progess then do not lose hope. It's normal. This stage of learning is called the consolidation phase, where growth becomes constant. This phase comes because our brain needs time to reconstruct Schemas, which is the structural pattern of mind i.e until now your brain was used to process information in hindi but from now on it also has to process in English. So, give it some time. Relax. Wait. Try your best. It will take min 6 months and max 2 years to get fully proficient at listening to English. The more you listen to different native speakers, the sooner you'll get results. Remember diversity is the key since everyone has unique way of speaking.

It's not difficult to find people interested in speaking English (google: language partners / language exchange).  It's the best way to become a better communicator in English - the very best way!  :)  Now, in your case, I suggest something a little different.  That's because you stated that your specific goal is to get 800 points on the TOEIC.  So, for you, the best course of action is to find either a guide to the TOEIC or a teacher that has experience and proven results (i.e. his or her students increased their TOEIC scores).   Whether you work with a guide or a teacher, your goal is the same:  Find out how the TOEIC is designed and what specific skills you need to improve to increase your score.  All standardized tests have a 'system', and you can understand that system and refine your studying/practicing to improve your odds of doing well.   If what you really want is to ace the TOEIC, be strategic.  If you just want to be a better communicator, talk to as many people as you can!   Good luck!  Nataliehttp://natdevo.com ",

            "answer_text": "It's been said that the most important skill to master in any language is listening. I think another common notion in language learning is that real mastery is only learned through experience gained in conversational speech. it's because a surprising variety of nuances will occur to you as you listen to spoken (rather than read written) language. Hence, it will also sharpen your ear to listen closely to English, because it has many idioms and rule exceptions. Once you learn most of the rules and exceptions, you\u2019ll have the basis for learning about poetic and other special cases, and much more modern English like that used in rapping. This is why if you are comparatively new to English, I\u2019d suggest that you do not plunge directly into a lot of Shakespeare and Joyce, even in the theater. Instead, I\u2019d suggest watching films from the 1940s (in which most film dialouge was very carefully written and performed). In the 1950s there was a cloud of anti-communism that affected film scripts (e.g., some of Hollywood\u2019s best writers were excluded), and in the mid-1960s and beyond, film dialogue may be too \u201cmodern\u201d to be readily grasped on first hearing.

Ask them to slow down or repeat if they are speaking too fast - the point is for you to understand.Speak (and think) to yourself in English. This is good practice for when you can\u2019t have a conversation with other English speakers.The more you practice listening and speaking in different contexts, the easier it will be for you to understand spoken English at different paces.

Anyways, the reasons of your problem can be The people you have problem talking to,may be quite fluent in english or they might be using certain complex words in order to boast their knowledge of language.The speed of speaking in those people is higher as compared to yours and that's why you find it hard to understand what they are saying.You have a slow thought process and thus you need to work on it.In all the above cases, it's necessary to identify the main cause of the hurdle that you are facing and i would suggest you to talk to everyone in english only (if they are comfortable with the language). Atleast you can talk to your friends that way. Watch english movies, meaningful videos on youtube, try to know the correct pronounciation of words (there might be certain words which you know well but you may be pronouncing them wrong and hence not able to understand when someone else uses them). In case, you do not have anyone to talk to, then stand in front of a mirror , choose whatever topic that you can speak on and start talking. Ask any question yourself to yourself and answer it yourself. It works. ",

I make a podcast for intermediate and advanced learners called English Fluency Now podcast. You can get it on iTunes.  Another good idea is to listen to something that you have already listened to in your own language, a news cast or movie or something like that.

Especially sitcoms like Friends, Seinfeld, etc. where you can not only improve your listening skills, but also learn jokes/humor and colloquial English. Another method is listening to a lot of music. I usually use these methods on my own time when I'm trying to improve my other languages (not English, it's my native language). I hope you give these methods a try and good luck. ",

Understand that you will not hear every single word. We reduce a lot of words in English, so you need to listen for content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) and not worry quite as much about function words (prepositions, articles, conjunctions), at least at first. If you can generally get the main idea of what is being said from the content words, then it's a good idea to start focusing on the ways we reduce and link certain sounds. An easy example is that \u201cwant to\u201d generally sounds like one word: \u201cwanna\u201d. But there are lots of other similar patterns to watch for. Don't focus on understanding every single word. Start with movies you have already seen in your language so that you don't get frustrated trying to understand. Also, go back, rewind 30 seconds when you want to hear something again. Look for patterns. I hope this helps! ",

I think movies and tv series with subtitles are really good for that. After you're more comfortable, try it without. Even if you're not getting all of it, eventually your ear will start picking out words, given you know the vocabulary. I would suggest always listening to the language at a normal pace, and not a slower one as, for me personally, the rhythm is different. You also should try to keep learning new vocabulary as well just so you can distnguish more words. Speaking with a native is also really helpful once you're a little more advanced as often native speakers speak a bit quicker so it'll challenge you even more. :) ",

There are alternative options, though, since USA and UK have very widely-known bands (I myself probably know more north-american than Brazilian singers!) and music is such a good way to get started. When you feel confident enough, you can try tv series with subtitles (so that you pay double attention to what is being said and less on what is being shown. Eventually, you'll not need subs and will be ready for the last and most difficult step: maintaining a fluent talk with someone. I have my father and younger brother to practice that, even though they're not native speakers either, but it is a really important step. ",

Find a story with text and accompanying video. Start by reading the text first, then watch the video. Listen to the reporter and try to pick out words and phrases you know. -- If this is too easy, try watching the video first. Now you are listening to a news report in English, just as it is presented to a native speaker.Now double check on special English VOA to see if you were getting the details right. If you are brave, you can listen to the BBC world news broadcast. No video safety net there! Thank you for asking me this!

So beside improving listening skills you practise the language as it is supposed to be, not the slang or swear words that you can easily find in films or songs without realising they should not be used in certain circumstances",

We can improve listening skills by watching your favorite movie, which you have already watched in the language you understand in English with subtitles. This way you can read, listen and repeat. And when in meeting or presentation try to listen to the speaker and after the meeting or any presentation try to write your view on that subject matter . This will help to retain information about what we listened to. Otherwise you can buy audiobook of your favorite author and listen to it. In this way you can understand the situation and emotions played in the book and also the part of punctuation can be clearly understood. Listen to ted.ed talks they always have subtitles and you can watch their presentation or animation. All the best. ",

We can all think faster than we speak, so it is tempting sometimes to fill in the end of the sentence you're hearing and start thinking about something else. Try behaving like a reporter: make notes on a conversation, and try to write it out word for word. You won't have much luck early on, but you could train yourself to drop the old habits and start positively listening. As well as the dictation method, try to summarise what you've just heard in a couple of sentences. For relaxation, get audio books from your library and listen for pleasure. Anything more complex than Young Adult stuff will tone up your listening muscles and change your mind-wandering habits. ",

Second, you listen to some materials in attention, better to transcript or re-speak what you are listening, and then check it compared to the true text. Then you must keep feedback, listening to what you hear wrongly a lot of times. Keep doing it again and again. I find it fits me best. Hope it works for you, too. ",

Always try to listen and really understand what they\u2019re talking without using any subtitles. There\u2019s alot of learning sources nowadays. I think if you google free english listening test, there will be thousands of wesbites pop up. You can also look up to this website : Blog - Premier TEFL ",

First, put subtitles in your language, so your ear gets used to English, and things such as specific oral sentences. After a while when you feel ready, put subtitles in English to be more likely to recognize and remember the words you don't know.

You will be used to characters with their specific accent and pronunciation. In case you can properly listen the 90% of text, the rest can be guessed. Otherwise subtitles need to be downloaded and listened in Google Translate. After watch series again. I watch this way \"Game of Thrones\" and it helps a lot.  But don't watch serials/movies with subtitles. It can be as funny as funny movie itself but useless for listening training.  Because when you watch with subtitles you train reading only. Good luck.
