            "answer_text": "If you are a Premium user, you are not able to download music from Spotify for listening offline. The feature of downloading Spotify music is only available for those Premium users. So, if you don\u2019t have an active Premium account, you will not have the ability to download Spotify music. But if you have a Spotify music converter like Tunelf, you will have the chance. It gives you the chance to access offline Spotify music tracks. And you can save Spotify music tracks to your computer. ",
