            "answer_text": "In the roughly 6 years that the Beatles recorded their entire catalogue, Lennon certainly became more experimental and outwardly expressive with his voice. Some examples are in his somewhat restrained but gravely, Dylanesque vocal delivery in \u201cYou\u2019ve Got To Hide Your Love Away\u201d, his almost glass-cutting, piercing tone in \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d and his raucous, mock-blues angst in \u201cYer Blues\u201d. But from the very beginning John always had the most edgy, or raw sounding voice of the Beatles. This is evident in one of their earliest recording sessions - on \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d from their debut album \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d. That edginess, combined with McCartney\u2019s smoother sounding but extremely versatile voice helped define the Beatles sound (in terms of vocals). After the Beatles, Lennon\u2019s voice noticeably changed in 1970 as a result of the primal therapy sessions he attended. Primal therapy was created by psychologist / psychotherapist Arthur Janov. Janov wrote a book called \u201cThe Primal Scream\u201d in which he proposed that certain types of neurosis or emotional pain, often stemming from childhood trauma, could be treated or cured by patients screaming phrases such as \u201cMommy! Daddy!\u201d. That therapy had a marked effect on John\u2019s voice which can be heard on his solo album \u201cPlastic Ono Band\u201d, released in December 1970. Songs like \u201cMother\u201d (during the outro) and a few others feature John screaming, but in a way that works musically, and has a stunning effect on the listener. The effectiveness of primal therapy, and whether that screaming had any long-term negative effects on Lennon\u2019s voice, are controversial. However, they certainly helped make that album one of the greatest and most influential by any artist up to that point. The raw and authentic emotional expression in Lennon\u2019s voice on that album can be heard in the works of later artists. Kurt Cobain is an excellent example, whether he was consciously emulating Lennon or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Well personally I\u2019d say the answer to that question myself, would be yes. Not exactly a very strong yes, but there\u2019s definitely something in his voice that changed at some point during the 60\u2019s. Whether it\u2019s because of drugs, alcohol, smoking, or just a result of getting older, I cannot say for certain. I know that he hated his voice and tried to make it sound different, but I\u2019m pretty sure that can\u2019t be the cause. His voice seemed to change a bit starting with \u201cRain\u201d, though it\u2019s not really until 1968 that I can really hear the difference between his pre-1966 voice and his post-1967 voice. Even on songs like \u201cI\u2019ll Cry Instead\u201d where his voice is sorta scratchy, it\u2019s not quite how it was on songs like \u201cHey Bulldog\u201d. If you compare songs like \u201cOne After 909\u201d (which was written a longtime before the other songs recorded around that time, in-fact the Let It Be sessions were not the first ones in which the song was recorded) with the songs that were both recorded and written as late as the early 60\u2019s, you should be able to pick up some difference in his voice. Also if you compare John Lennon\u2019s 1975 rock and roll album with the songs he covered while he was a Beatle in the early 60\u2019s, there\u2019s definitely some vocal differences there. And even if you compare his voice in ballads like \u201cWoman\u201d to his voice in ballads like \u201cIn My Life\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Well this is only my opinion and my observation since I am a Beatles fanatic. No, John\u2019s voice didn\u2019t change at all. It could maybe he keep on singing everyday which his voice is still same through the years. Unlike other singers that their voice change like Rick Astley, Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet and Dionne Warwick. During their heydays, their voices are mesmerizing but all of a sudden they stopped in certain period. Then today they comeback but their voice is different.Maybe its age or no practice . ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it did . When they started out they were doing So many gigs around Liverpool and the the UK his voice was somewhat \u201c earthy \u201c or \u201cgravelly \u201c. Obviously when your vocal chords get a thrashing singing songs like Rock and Roll music every night is going to take its toll. Later after success he had far more time to rest his voice so melodic renditions of \u201c beautiful boy \u201c etc seemed more smooth. ",
