            "answer_text": "Yes, do have some. GOOBA - 69  No explaining, just click on this music video and see how bad this is. Swish Swish - Katy Perry  Dead memes and cringe. Also click on the music video to see how cringy this fricking 6 minute video it is. Look what you made me do - Taylor Swift  To be honest, not a big fan of this music. I love Taylor, but this is my least favorite song from her. Anaconda - Nicki Minaj  I also love Nicki. Same as Taylor, I\u2019m just not a fan of this. Camelot - NLE Choppa  Same as Gooba, no explaining, just click on the video. I personally don\u2019t like songs by Lyrical Lemonade except for the Juice WRLD ones. I love Lucid Dreams. So yeah, that\u2019s pretty much all. ~Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "THIS SONG!! Drove me crazy when it came out.  For context I got into Kpop while living & working in Japan. By then I hadn\u2019t been to the USA in years & didn\u2019t keep up with the music. I went back to visit on holiday once & all I kept hearing was this song. Repeat on the radio, at stores, in my sister\u2019s car \u201cPANDA, PANDA, PANDA\u201d. I checked the lyrics to try & make sense of it, but that didn\u2019t even help. I was looking forward to actually hearing some new music in English again, but this song was just so repetitive & annoying. I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to Asia & Kpop. I\u2019m not a fan of cute songs, but I\u2019d rather listen to 10 minutes of \u201cshy, shy, shy\u201d than another second of PANDA. Rant over. Honestly I try not to hate on music that just isn\u2019t my taste, but this was too much. Maybe if I wasn\u2019t surrounded by the song it wouldn\u2019t have drove me so crazy. ",
