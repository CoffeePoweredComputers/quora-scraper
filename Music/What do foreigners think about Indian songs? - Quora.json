            "answer_text": "A2A, While a foreigner would be much better suited to answer this question, I am going to give this a try. I am assuming the question is referring to bollywood songs. In that case, the music would be drastically different from what they are used to. (This has changed in recent times, a lot of bollywood songs are taking \u2018influences\u2019 from rock, edm etc) I am just going to leave this video here:  The video is just for fun and in no way represents what anybody thinks about any song. Now, since the question states \u2018Indian songs\u2019, I would also like to mention two Indian bands, that play original music, and that I follow. The first is Demonic Resurrection. Fronted by Sahil Makhija, or as people in the Indian metal scene call him, Demonstealer, Demonic Resurrection is a blackened death metal band from mumbai and have been killing it since 2000. They have played festivals like wacken and bloodstock, which in itself speaks volumes about how good they are, and the people in Germany and England seemed to love them. The second, What Escapes Me, is a progressive metal band from Kolkata. They released their debut album, \u201cEgress Point\u201d last year, and were praised by several top music magazines as one of the best metal releases of 2016. ",
