            "answer_text": "There are 2 types of audition. One is a face to face audition while the other is a online audition by email. Live audition (Face to Face audition) Learn basic hangul language such as basic greetings.Learn their customs and etiquettes.Do not sing a popular Korean song unless you can pronounce it, well enough for them to understand.Do NOT SING A SONG SUNG BY ONE OF THEIR OWN ARTISTS in their company unless you can sing better than the artists themselves. (Remember, they know their own songs inside and out and are tired of hearing it as most popular K-pop songs are constantly played in the bus or cafes in Korea)Prepare a dance. Just in case they ask you to dance since all k-pop groups and solo artists dances.Dress simply. Don't overstyle your outfit.Smile at the judges. Everyone loves it when someone smiles warmly at them especially when the judges are tired, having evaluated thousands of auditions.Show your personality. Don\u2019t be afraid of showing the best version of yourself. If you\u2019re shy be shy and sing warmly in your song, if you\u2019re cheerful, tell a joke and try to make the tired judges laugh)Be respectful.Online Audition Sing at least 2 to 3 songs, one song could be a Korean song while the other two could be english songs or your own song you've written.Video quality should be good.Say your greetings in Korean language as koreans would be glad that you took the effort in learning basic Korean. (FACT: All Koreans have pride in their language so if they see or hear someone speaking in Korean or trying to learn hangul they would be happy as hangul is one of the most prominent scientific language ever invented. Hangul was invented by King Sejong)Good luck with your audition. \u263a ",

Prepare 1 choreography to showcase when asked to dance (optional but preferred). Be mentally prepared for freestyle dancing. For rappers: at least 2 rap verses in languages mentioned above.

For dancers: at least 2 choreographies in any genre (hip-hop and k-pop preferred). Be mentally prepared for freestyle dancing. Prepare 1\u20132 songs in languages mentioned above when asked to sing/rap. (For minors: your parents.) EDIT: apparently the question changed :\u2019( I\u2019m going to put important notes that might make you change your mind about this career: You might not get to debut and if you\u2019re from a small company, your debut may not guarantee success.There may be bullying/discrimination involved if you\u2019re a foreigner/look different and got targeted by problematic trainees. Worse if you end up debuting with them because your group chemistry and career will be affected. We all know how this goes down.Some trainees faint of exhaustion because they feel too pressured to improve (training overnight) or lose weight. Self-discipline and care is very important.Your dorm might be infested with cockroaches or whatever bugs you can imagine, especially in the summer.Your dorm might not have the best water heater and air conditioner. Have fun in the winter.Your dorm might not be spiritually clean (:If you\u2019re from a small company, you don\u2019t earn money the moment you debut because of trainee debt. This can last for 5\u20137 years in worst cases.Some employees subtly take advantage of trainees/rookies to vent their anger.There is a lot of drama amongst trainees in big companies and the atmosphere can be very toxic. You can become toxic TO YOURSELF.Some trainees don\u2019t have company friends at all. Yes, legit loners. If you\u2019re not a super introverted person, this will be torturous.You don\u2019t get a say in a lot of things (stage outfits, schedules, discography etc.).Sometimes, idols don\u2019t get to sleep properly because their schedules will be stacked one after another for 2\u20133 days. On top of that, they\u2019re not allowed to show that they\u2019re tired around fans and for the sake of their image, they gotta perform their 110%.Rookies from small companies live with anxiety everyday because they won\u2019t know how long their company can stay afloat. If the company falls apart, you have to deal with team management all by yourself and if there\u2019s a disbandment, have to risk going through the audition/debut process in another company all over again.Might add more if I can think of more. This job isn\u2019t for EVERYONE. Many idols are suffering because of this career choice. I\u2019m saying all these because I want aspiring idols to take it seriously. It\u2019s a career, not a hobby. ",
