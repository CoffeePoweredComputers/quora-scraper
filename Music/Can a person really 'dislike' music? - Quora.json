            "answer_text": "Since I was young I have hated music. I avoid it wherever I can. In the last 50 years I have always switched of audio on all my devices and no longer visit cnn because news and music just don't go together. When I am in a place where music is unavoidable like a clothes shop I do what I have to and leave. As a student in university I put a audio cassette on autoplay and kept it running for a full year (sousa marches) as a way of covering the sound of my neighbours music. (After long enough the mind filters out repetitive sounds.) I find music interferes with my thinking to the end tent that I cannot talk, I struggle to walk and even the most basic activities like getting dressed become impossible. Music creates so much stress in my life that even typing this in a silent room is disturbing. My biggest nightmare is the phonecall where they put you on hold and force you to listen to their choice of music. So yes you can dislike music, and you can have stronger emotions too. ",

I honestly don't know if there's anyone out there that has sworn off music forever, but I know some people that are so indifferent about music it's funny. They don't care about it at all and most of the time prefer silence instead of music. ",

When it comes to mid-20th century forward, I pick and choose. This doesn\u2019t mean that another person only listens to a particular period of pop or different periods classical. If music speaks to you, listen. Try to be open to other eras but you don\u2019t have to like them and go back to them. If music pleases you, listen and enjoy! Happy listening. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, music itself is personal. However, it depends on how a certain song reaches your ear. The clearest example of this is the visual, sentimental or sensory connotation we relate the song to. We can watch a movie and hear for the fist time a song at the most romantic moment and fell in love with it, or hear the best uplifting song in the climax of the story when the character decides to be the best (i.e. Rocky) It is very hard to judge a song if you have been forced to assosiate it with a moment that created an impact in you. Never the less you can hear a random song on the radio, club, supermarket and love it or hate it. ",

You see when you listen to a kind of music or to a song you do it for various reasons, and the music speaks to you. Music is a way of commnication and expression and you have to find your own kind that expresses you. The thing is that music can be shared. You can feel the same things about songs with other people so then it\u2019s not personall anymore. ",

The line between art created from love and passion or profitable business is dissolved once a person accepts revenue for the very art that they create. Some would believe its the equivalent of selling your soul to the devil. So in relation to music you have ever heard and enjoyed from any artist, enjoy it for what it is but NO it was never personal. It was strictly capitalism because that is the American way. ",
