            "answer_text": "Synthetic, yes. Soulless, I don\u2019t think so, but that\u2019s down to personal opinion. Simply, the reason recorded music today sounds \u201csynthetic\u201d is because of two things: a lot of things are in fact synthesized and simulated, and second, people actually want to hear it that way. Traditional music gear are expensive, require tons of space, and are subject to lots of noise, interference, degradation, etc.. Today, we have computers and digital gear that gets rid of much of the negatives while still sounding the same, more or less. There\u2019s less air (quite literally), and things sound less raw, but it\u2019s very convenient, and there\u2019s much less things to worry about, and workflows become blazingly fast. Don\u2019t get music gear history wrong though - each decade, engineers and musicians always try to sterilize sound. Every step, from shellac to vinyl to analog tape to digital tape to digital files wanted to get rid of noise and get increased resolution and clarity and the truest audio signal. Same with electronic music from tape playbacks to oscillators to digital synthesis to sampling - they wanted to get rid of wow and flutter and drift and get stable tuning and predictable timbre and pure tone. Yet who complains about the \u201csterile\u201d sound? The hippie listeners, the nostalgic listeners, the close-minded musicians who are \u201call about the music\u201d and can\u2019t be bothered with new things, and engineers who did not want to explore new things because they were confusing and expensive and they are already experts at what was available at the time thinking they\u2019d never be replaced. But who likes the sterile sound? Pretty much everyone. People who grew up with CDs and mp3s know the truth - modern records are clearer, less muddy, have better dynamics. The old people who marvel at the clarity of their Beatles remasters have digital post-production to thank, because if old gear were all that, no one would need digital remasters. Musicians are thankful of the sterile sound because it means they can create music on the go, never having to worry about making demos with lots of noise - scratch tracks can transform into released tracks without ever seeing the light of a traditional recording studio. Now, soulless. Again, that\u2019s quite subjective. We can agree to disagree. But to me, the \u201csoul\u201d of music is not in whether a recording is \u201csterile\u201d or not, but it\u2019s all about the composition. If the composition is boring, cut out of a template, it will still be soulless, even if you hire all real instrumentalists recording in a traditional studio with all the analog gear you can find. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a producer. I work in pop music a lot. I\u2019ve also made a lot of retro sounding records. I\u2019ve worked using techniques from literally every era of recording (even recording to wax disc and wire instead of tape*) and with all this experience I can tell you, straight answer\u2026 Because people like it that way. Seriously, they do. It\u2019s not a conspiracy or an \u201cerosion at the foundation of art\u201d. People just like it because they\u2019re used to it and it sounds good. Better than good. Perfect really! Not to mention the fact it sounds synthesised because it\u2019s full of synthesisers (duh!). However I will acknowledge that there is a trend of going horribly far with this perfection and most of it sits with the vocals. Many artists have pitch correction applied to their voices who frankly don\u2019t need it. Ever. Case in point, this poor b*stard:  Now the first thing to note is that \u2018auto-tune\u2019 is not auto. At all. All modern pitch correction (at a pro level) is performed painstakingly by hand. Now here\u2019s Bubl\u00e9, a better techinical singer than Sinatra ever was** and they pitch correct the hell out of him. Some poor tea boy spends hours ruining this man\u2019s voice. But do you know why? Here\u2019s the real kicker: Because the 60 years+ demographic don\u2019t like it without and they\u2019re the only ones buying pop/chart records. Yes ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s true. The worst culprits for the aiding and abetting of horrible, soulless hit-parade music are our elder generation. Money talks and they\u2019re the ones who still actually spend it. You can thank strictly, pop idol, X factor and daytime television for that. Meanwhile back at the ranch, the kids are watching nextflix and listening to loud out of tune thrash-tastic music and actually don\u2019t mind either way. Sure some of it is pitch-corrected but not the obvious majority. At this point I\u2019d like to name check a few artists who might actually change your mind across a variety of levels of \u2018synthesisedness\u2019: JD McPherson Metric Slaves Imogen Heap Everything Everything \u2014 *Pro tip: Don't record on reel-to-reel wire. It sucks. **When he\u2019s sober. There was a rough patch there, poor guy. I think he\u2019s back on the horse now though. \u2014 EDIT: Seeing as a lot of people keep bringing up the same issues I\u2019d like to add the following points for clarity: If you\u2019re 60+ and pitch-correct drives you crazy then bravo, give yourself a big pat on the back for having some ability to use your ears. Maybe take an extra biscuit at teatime or something. You earned it.If you\u2019re 60+ and you have said musical taste you are not an entire demographic. Don\u2019t take it personally, it\u2019s not about you.If you\u2019re any age and thinking \u2018music is all sh*t these days and stopped improving after year X\u2019 then you likely lack the requisite perspective or open mindedness to engage in discourse about the state of modern music. You may want to see to that, there\u2019s great stuff out there for those willing to look.Bear in mind that most new music has largely undergone a diaspora out of the traditional Top 40 format. What\u2019s left in the charts is typically the worst representation of what modern music has to offer. Mainly a pale imitations of other, less fortunate, more skilled artists.Oliver Lee's answer to Rock and pop music diversified so much in the 40 years after \"Rock Around The Clock\" but almost seems to have stopped evolving. Is there nowhere new for it to go?",
