            "answer_text": "A movie director neither finances a movie nor produces it. It is the producer\u2019s responsibility to acquire financing for a movie, and uses some of that money to hire the director to direct it. These movie financing may come from a film studio, a group of investors, or even a bank. Now, let\u2019s look into what\u2019s required to pay that money back. Theater box office revenue is split between the theater owner and the film distributor. In the first week at the movie theater, the distributor gets 75\u201380% of the box office revenue. In the second and third week, that percentage drops down to 45% to 55%. At four weeks or longer, it drops down to 20% or lower. But, for simplicity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say that the theater owner and distributor splits the box office revenue 50/50. So, that must mean that a film made for $100m, must earn more than $200m at the box office, right? Wrong! Because the studio takes about a hefty distribution fee for distributing the film. And then there\u2019s the cost of prints (making copies of the film) and marketing (which on tent-pole films could be as much as the production budget). So, let\u2019s say that $100m film must make over $400m at the box office before any profits come in. But what if the director or stars of the film negotiated a deal where they receive a share of the gross (or worse, from the production company\u2019s point of view, net) profits? That must be paid out before the production company makes a profit. Of course, very few films in the United States earn anywhere near $400m at the domestic box office. They have to rely on foreign box office to turn a profit. But the problem is that the economics are different in each country. For example, some countries take taxes out of box office receipts. So, it is difficult to come up with a dollar figure for what makes a film profitable. However, we can say that a film is considered a huge financial success if it earns more money in the box office that analysts expected it to make. Even then, we aren\u2019t considering the revenues a film might earn after it completes its theatrical run \u2014 revenues from broadcast, cable, streaming, and retail sales of the movie. A film could bomb at the box office, but continue to earn revenues from all these sources for decades and become profitable. ",

            "answer_text": "Directors generally get an agreed upon beforehand salary, which would be included in the movie production costs. It's possible in some cases they may agree to get some percentage of the sales or profits, in which case they would get paid less if a movie does poorly. But unless a director used their own money to finance the movie, I can't imagine they would lose their own money. Generally it's the studio and whatever investors it has spending the money for production of a $100 million movie. If a movie does poorly, I'm not sure if the studio has to just eat the losses entirely or gets to write some of the losses off. But a movie doing badly generally hurts the studio. How Much Money Does a Film Director Make? In terms of how much money does a movie need to make to start making money, I\u2019ve read that studios get about half the box office receipts (e.g. Movie makes $200 M box office, studio gets $100 M). This isn't perfect, as a lot of international markets give the studios less than half. It depends on the deals the studio has with these markets. So depending on what markets the movie is making money, probably talking between 200\u2013250M box office just to break even on production costs. Another rule of thumb I've seen is divide the production costs in half, and that number is the additional money the studio spent on advertising. So a $100 M movie could have an additional $50 M spent on advertising, for a $150M total. Again, not a perfect number, as that could vary by studio and movie, but at least gives you some idea of the kind of money getting spent. So need an additional 100\u2013125M to cover that. So a $100M movie would probably need to be making between 300\u2013375M, which we\u2019ll just say $350 to have one number, to break even at the box office. Which is serious box office, as only about 25 movies cracked that last year. http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2016 But movies also make money from other sources, such as DVD rentals and sales, video on demand, streaming services, cable fees, and any kind of merchandizing and product tie ins. I have no idea how much that adds, but you have to think that's decent bank. So if a $100M movie cracks $300M worldwide ticket sales, you figure with all these other sources, it's probably doing ok. If it's over $400M in ticket sales, it's making good money. ",
