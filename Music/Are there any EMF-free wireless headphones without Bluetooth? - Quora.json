            "answer_text": "I really don\u2019t know where to start but I will try my best to answer. First things first, EMF-free electronics really cannot exist. The flow of electrons or an electrical charge will generate EMF, so headphones in itself will generate EMF, and this is even before you get into wireless. You can do things to reduce EMF exposure by using shielding and in the case of headphones by using Air Tubes to get the sound from the EMF shielded audio transducers (aka \u201cspeakers\u201d) upto and into your ears. I would think that the lowest EMF headphones would be wired headphones with Air Tubes to get the sound to your ears\u2026 This setup could/should move the primary EMF source away from your head, and put it in a box/container that could be shielded to contain the EMF that the speakers would generate. There are plenty of wireless headphones that don\u2019t use Bluetooth, but unless you are going to go old-school \u201cinfrared\u201d (IR) wireless, pretty much all of them use some form of radio to get the signal from the source to the headphones. If by headphones you actually meant headset (headphones with a microphone) for use with a phone, then I don\u2019t think anyone ever made an IR headset. But I could be wrong. Bottom line EMF-free headphones really cannot exist due to the nature of using electricity to generate sound in the first place, and it only gets worse when you add wireless to the equation, because wireless usually means using some form or radio communications, and RF radiation generates both E and M fields, and that M field is the same M that is found in EMF. I think this answers your actual question, everything beyond this point is information on EMF and other types of radiation, just in case you are interested or want to know/learn more\u2026 If you are concerned about exposure to EMF or other types of radiation then you might take a look around specifically looking into/at ionizing radiation (the kind that tends travel deep into the body and can damage cells internally) that starts at \u201cExtreme\u201d UV and up. Then there is non-ionizing radiation which starts at 0hz and goes up through \u201cNear\u201d UV light (this kind tends not travel deeply or too deeply and can cause damage by heating of cells and tissue). Ionizing radiation includes X-Rays, Gamma Rays and the like, and tend to be what people think of when they talk about radiation. This type causes damage to cells at the atomic level, by creating free radicals when they temporarily \u201cknock off\u201d or \u201cadd\u201d electrons from/to an atom, molecule or ion. The affected atom becomes very reactive and will try to correct the imbalance by merging with or taking or giving the extra electron to another atom. This can result in the formation of undesirable \u201cstuff\u201d if this happens in mass it can exceed the bodies ability to effectively deal with the \u201cstuff\u201d and that can affect one\u2019s health. Sorry, about getting vague, but that happens when I stray away from subjects I have an understanding of. In short, Ionizing radiation can damage DNA, which is critical to the proper operation and reproduction of the cells that make up our bodies. Too much damage, and first the cells either stop working/die or cannot reproduce correctly. In the worst case incorrectly reproducing cells that go out of control can become what we call \u201ccancer\u201d. This is why the government puts limits on how much Ionizing radiation that workers are allowed to be exposed to, and why Ionizing radiation is regulated/controlled. Non-ionizing radiation includes visible and invisible light, radio waves, sound and magnetic waves. These tend to either pass through you without any effect, or may be absorbed by the tissue which causes heating of affected tissue. The depth of tissue penetration depends on the actual frequency and the amount of potential heating damage depends on the power level (strength) of the signal (radiation). UV light which fits into both categories can cause both thermal and internal cell damage, depending on the version or type of UV radiation. What you hear about most is UV-A, B and C which is a really small part of the entire UV spectrum or band. UV-A causes tanning, and can prematurely age the skin, but isn\u2019t considered to be all that dangerous to the skin. UV-B is what causes sunburns, can damage eyes, and can/will damage the skin (at the cellular/DNA level) and is linked to skin cancer. UV-C isn\u2019t naturally present on earth, as it\u2019s absorbed by the atmosphere, however it can be man-made, and is germicidal (kills germs by damaging them at the molecular/DNA level), but isn\u2019t linked to skin cancer, but many sources can be/are powerful enough to cause damage, especially eye damage. Most of the man-made radiation we are exposed to is non-ionizing and is usually at power levels where the chance for damage/injury though heating is negligible to non-existent. The most common form of man-made non-ionizing radiation will come in the form of radio and microwave radiation, which is also called radio frequency (RF) radiation. Unless you intentionally ignore warning signs, or intentionally do something to expose yourself, it would be pretty hard to expose yourself to dangerous or damaging amounts of RF energy. Your microwave uses non-ionizing radiation to excite the molecules in the food to cause it to heat up. But the microwave is designed to contain the RF radiation so that you are not exposed to it. Your phone generates RF but it is at a level where the heating effect if any is negligible or at a level where it would be difficult to measure/see and effect of, because your body is constantly moving heat from the interior of the body to the exterior. However, the easiest part of your body to damage with non-ionizing radiation is probably the eyes, well to be more precise the retina, because those cells though inside the body, are exposed to the outside and if the retina\u2019s cells are damaged, it can affect eyesight. My personal understanding and experience says that RF energy that starts in the HF range (sometimes called shortwave or just below what we call AM radio) and ends in the UHF range (where some Two-way radios and phones operate at) is pretty non-threatening/dangerous unless you are messing directly with the antenna, the feed lines (cables & connectors), and the damage when it happens tends to be more along the lines of an electrical burn which is just another form of heating damage. The effects of the RF radiation drops off very quickly with distance, and that\u2019s what makes the threat/danger mostly concentrated to direct contact to the antenna/feedline. When it comes to microwave frequencies, then it\u2019s mostly the power level that\u2019s important. High power microwave transmissions are usually/normally focused \u201cbeams\u201d and you would have to get directly in front/line with the antenna before things start to become worrisome. Radar sets (for ships, aircraft, weather) can generate pretty high power levels at the antenna, but it also drops off quickly as the distance increases, which is why we are not being cooked by all the different microwave sources that are all around us. A microwave oven can generate 1000 watts or more of microwave RF energy, which at 2.45 Ghz can penetrate up to around 17 mm or almost 11/16th of an inch of muscle tissue, and will have dumped all it\u2019s heating energy into the tissue by the time it gets that deep. But even at those power levels, it still takes time before something in the microwave gets warm/hot, of course if the item is small/thin it heats \u201cfaster\u201d because the energy is able to completely penetrate the item and basically heat it all up at once, for larger items, the heat generated has to actually travel through the item being heated because the microwave energy can only penetrate so deep. The good news is that microwave and radar sources have tended to generate lower power levels as time passes, with advances in receiver technology. The more sensitive the receiver the less power the transmitter needs to send out for the system to work. The only microwave source that may have become stronger might only be the one that is in the microwave oven. Because more power means faster \u201ccooking\u201d\u2026 I understand that there are some concerns with EMF and other types of radiation, when I see these claims, I first check to see if those who are making the claims trying to sell me something. Then I go and try to confirm the claims by searching or finding results from places that I understand to be trustworthy. I really like going to Wikipedia as I find it to be a place that brings lots of information into one place, and the sources quoted/found in the \u201carticles\u201d will allow you to check the source information for yourself. I inherently believe people/sources that have nothing to benefit from when they provide information, and sources who have a professional name or reputation to protect also rate pretty high. So for medical info I trust NHS, WebMD and other hospital/medical sites, as well as most government sites, because in general government sites have nothing to gain since they are taxpayer funded, and are not profit oriented\u2026 I also do try to keep an open mind and look at all info presented, and then make my own decision based on the best info I can find. I commend you if you made it this far, and I do hope that you found this info to be helpful/useful. If you do find EMF-free wireless headphones, then be really cautious and careful as I do think that they are being offered by a snake oil dealer\u2026 Because EMF-free wireless headphones should be about as rare as unicorns are\u2026 Cheers!
