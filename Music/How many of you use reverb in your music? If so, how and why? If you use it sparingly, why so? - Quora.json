            "answer_text": "I have to say that as someone with a long involvement in music making and recording, I cannot imagine not using reverb! I have recorded lots of tracks for myself and other people, and currently I specialise in doing mixes. In mixing I attempt to get each instrument or voice to sound the best it can, in the context of the whole, but the creation of the whole involves three things: the relative levels (volumes) of each part or voice. This does not have to be static, which is a common mistake among novice mixers, but can rise or fall in the context of the song.The spatial positioning of each part in terms of stereo, that is from left to right. This is something which can be manipulated dynamically, but it is wise not to go overboard with it.the listening space you are creating in the context of the song.The latter is what we use reverb for. It also has an important function in creating the emotional atmosphere of the song. To illustrate, I only need to reference two tracks I\u2019m currently working on. Yesterday I made some progress with a funk instrumental track from a project I\u2019m working on with a friend here in Auckland. It\u2019s mid-tempo, I\u2019ve programmed a tight drum groove, I have a bass guitar part I\u2019m pleased with, but will redo with a few more fills, grace notes and variations, and there are relatively few instrumental parts. There are two reverbs on this - a short, tight one on the drums and percussion parts, and a longe, medium space reverb for keys and guitars. I want the rhythm section to gell together, so the reverb for that is a short plate reverb, with the low end rolled off, so that these separately programmed parts sound more cohesive, without being muddy. The bigger reverb puts a couple of lead parts in a bigger context, along with some delay on a send, and the same reverb is applied to an electric piano part and some ensemble brass. It\u2019s starting to sound good to me. I want the rhythm to have energy, but a lot of big reverb would wash that away. I can afford to get the keys to feel like they\u2019re in a bigger space, without the rhythm stuff sounding separate. It has to sound tight and funky, as if you were hearing it on a club. I never use reverb on bass, at least not for a funky track like this. Today I am beginning work on a track for a client. This is the last track in a progressive rock album I\u2019ve been mixing, which is basically almost a rock opera format, with several lead singers on each track effectively having conversations. It\u2019s a grand, cosmic-scale concept, so the listening space has to be big. I have to choose the right reverb, and will probably try two or three before settling on one to work with. I checked in my Logic Pro X setup, and, including the built-in reverbs, I have 48 reverb plugins! I try to be conservative with the number of reverbs I use on a project, and pretty well always put them on a send, rather than as track inserts, which gives a reverb for each part, as to me that creates a confusing, potentially very messy listening space. I\u2019m very likely to use something like Eventide\u2019s UltraReverb, which has a lot of useful parameters I can tweak, including EQs on input and output, so I\u2019m not putting reverb on deeper sounds and it stays bright. I\u2019m likely to set the Decay Time at 2 seconds, at least, and I will play with the room size. Another trick I might use is to duplicate the reverb on another send, but play with the predelay and use a noise gate on it, to give a very similar sound, but which might help emphasise particular parts. I also have dynamic changes in reverb sends, to highlight vocal phrases in particular. This has been done since the 50s, by hand, but these days I can automate from my DAW.  I mixed a simple acoustic track for a contemporary folk outfit a while back, and they needed to sound as if they were in an interesting intimate space, so I used Waves\u2019 Abbey Road echo chamber reverb recreation. It worked really well for that, but I won\u2019t be using it on the prog rock track. The reverb for that needs to be bigger and grander. If I didn\u2019t have UltraReverb, I might be using Logic\u2019s Space Designer convolution reverb, which is also excellent - I have a lot of good impulse files for that, and it\u2019s also very editable.

            "answer_text": "I love reverb. I use several kinds, all over the place. I\u2019m sort of an anomaly, though. I\u2019m heavily influenced by post-punk, mid-80\u2019s pop and shoegaze, all of which were pretty reverb-focused (although different kinds of reverb). I\u2019ve got my big slapbacky gated reverb on my snares and toms for that Hugh Padgham vibe. I\u2019ve got lush plates on vocals. I\u2019ve got big lexicon-ish halls on my synth pads. I mean I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019ll use Eventide Blackhole as an insert for some cavernous spatial processing. That\u2019s not normal. But when I do use reverb, I usually slap an EQ (sometimes with fairly extreme settings) in front of it to trim out some low end and sculpt things to sit in the mix - even though most reverbs have their own EQs onboard, with the exception of Fabfilter Pro-R\u2019s I generally find myself needing a bit finer control than the standard shelves/cuts . Sometimes I\u2019ll throw a sidechained compressor on to duck it against another signal and keep it out of the way in a mix. Sometimes I\u2019ll adjust the actual arrangement of the track so various sounds don\u2019t fight with each other when they\u2019ve been processed. I tend to use reverb personally more as an effect than as just a spatial processor. When I\u2019m working with other clients, however, then it\u2019s often a case of trying to sound like a natural space and get it all to sit nicely in the mix. Usually then my rule is \u201cif you can hear how nice the reverb is, there\u2019s too much reverb.\u201d ",
