            "answer_text": "You could call them and ask nicely the reason for the order not having been processed yet and ask them nicely for an ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival). They should be able to give you a vague notion of timeline. If it was just a regular order and if they push back on the question, you might want to mention that you could possibly just cancel the order and order from another store (Musicians Friend and Sweetwater are two I have used besides the Guitar Center), that might get them to be a little more helpful. Otherwise, just be patient, maybe contact them once a day to see if they can tell you more about where the package is. The key is: be nice and polite, don\u2019t get angry. If they get snarky with you, you can always ask for their manager. ",
