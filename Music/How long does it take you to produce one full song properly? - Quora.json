            "answer_text": "Umm\u2026It really depends. But normally for the creative process like writing melodies, chords, vocals & rough arrangement it takes me about 4\u20135 hours. After the creative part, comes sound selection. Sometimes I use presets or sometimes I design sounds on my own. It takes me about 1\u20132 hours. If I\u2019m satisfied about the rough arrangement of the song then I start mixing it. Cutting of low end if the high instruments, compressing the volume, distorting bass & other mixing stuff takes me about another 4\u20135 hours to do. Then mastering (which is something I\u2019m still weak at) takes me 2\u20133 hours more. But music is something I do part time. So I can\u2019t do all of this in one day. So it takes me about 2\u20133 days to complete a song. Then I test it in different speaker systems (beacuse final mix should sound good in every sound system). If I found some flaw, I go back and check & correct it. All this is really an ideal case, but in realuty sometimes vocalist are late to recording sessions. Sometimes in my creative process, I hang for no inspiration. Sometimes, I forget to save my project which I really regret later. So it really depends on all these. But most of the time it\u2019s completed (considered to be released) in about couple of weeks or so. This is my flow of working. Diffrent producers have diffrent work flows. Hope this helped.  Thanks of asking a question in my Music production Question session. I really appreciate it. Aaditya. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! Jeez, I don't know. That's a tough one because I have done so many songs for other people /or companies, and I actually sort of produce them as I record them. I have a huge whiteboard in my studio and draw out the project so I can use it as a blueprint and to-do list. I realize that's probably a disappointing non-answer. So I'll give you a better one based on songs that I've produced for myself or a high value client. About two weeks if there's no time crunch. Why? Because I like to flush it from my brain for a week before I jump behind the mix desk and turn those tracks into a finished song that gels just right and gets the most energy from it. I'll usually make several radically different mixes before I decide which direction to go. Sometimes I hear something new that needs reinforcement, so I may call someone back to change or upgrade a particular part. But normally I add the missing ingredients on my sampler. I've replaced guitar solos, added fat strings, brass stabs, doubled the bass track with cello\u2026.. Etc etc\u2026. The production is done when it's done. But it's very difficult to not \u201cover mix\u201d yourself into a corner. Especially when you own the studio and have unlimited time. ",
