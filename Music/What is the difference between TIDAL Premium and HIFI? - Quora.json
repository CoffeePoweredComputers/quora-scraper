            "answer_text": "The streams on Premium use lossy compression with a bit rate of 320kbps, the same as Spotify Premium. This compares to the original standard bit rate for digital music (CD) of 1440kbps. Tidal HiFi uses lossless compression (FLAC) which retains all of the original data of a 1440 kbps stream. In addition, by using the MQA system, Hi Fi has many streams with high resolution which substantially improves on the CD standard. Another service that provides FLAC streams and high resolution is Qobuz. They generally use better sounding masters than Tidal and offer high resolution without the need for MQA decoding capability. Most people find Qobuz\u2019s music library perfectly fine, but different folks will have different preferences in that regard. There is absolutely no question that there are significant differences in sound quality to be heard between the lossless and lossy services. However, this is not to say that all listeners will hear the difference or find it meaningful. ",
