            "answer_text": "There is no true equivalent performer because Elvis came at a major turning point in American music. There was no \"young people's music\" before rock n' roll hit about 1954\u20131955. Elvis embodied everything that the new music stood for. He was handsome,, cool, playful,talented, rebellious, and everything rockers like Buddy Holly, Bill Haley, Jerry lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and others had some of but Elvis had it all in one package. There might be a case made that right now at this moment Garth Brooks holds a place that Elvis had at the same age as Garth. Brooks hit the country music scene hard just as Elvis did (Elvis' first five records were only on the country chart) and garnered some of the same crowd excitement as Elvis did in his mid 20's. When Garth came to our town of Evansville Indiana in 1994 he was booked for a Saturday night. The concert sold out so quick they added a second show for Sunday which sold out equally as fast so a THIRD show was added on Friday. This was for a stadium that held about 11,000 for one show and a total of 33,000 people screamed and whistled and applauded continuous for three nights. This was unheard of at the time and comparable to an Elvis concert at the same point in his career. Elvis was only 42 when he died so if we look at where Garth was at age 42 in 2004 he had passed his prime but just like the mature Elvis Garth could still fill a concert hall and just like Elvis his music was only on the country charts at that time. Garth is 57 years old today which makes me wonder if Elvis had conquered his drug addiction and gotten in shape physically if he could have made a comeback like Garth did recently. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends how you define equivalent. There are lots of very good singers, and there are lots of very good performers who can enrapture the audience. And there are certainly plenty of performers who incorporate sexuality into their performances. But I would focus on what made Elvis special: he was a White performer who loved the music of the Black people of his era, which was rhythm and blues \u2014 blues-based music that broke out of the strictures of 12-bar blues. He adopted it and performed it very well, and helped make it mainstream among white audiences. For this reason, I\u2019d say a contemporary equivalent to Elvis is Eminem. (He\u2019s not exactly \u2018new,\u2019 but he\u2019s a very talented rap performer, not just a one-hit oddity like say, Vanilla Ice.) ",
