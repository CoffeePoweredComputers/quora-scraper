            "answer_text": "First of all I am gonna say that I am not a Beyonce fan. \u201cIf I Was A Boy\u201d is the kind of sexist dribble that makes all men out to be misogynistic adulterers, and Beyonce probably did the opposite of what she intended by creating a whole generation of the \u2018nice guys\u2019 that have to point out \u201cnot all men are pigs\u201d, every five seconds. Her other hits are nowhere near that awful but even then I can\u2019t quite get into them because when a guy treats her badly in one of her songs and she rightfully shows her power to him, it feels very much like a fantasy, not something that would actually happen. My favourite songwriters are ones that show vulnerability. You can see a lot of realism in the words Joni Mitchell wrote or the words Leonard Cohen wrote, or for a more modern example, the words that Regina Spektor wrote. Not every songwriter needs the most accurate understanding of relationships ever but I find Beyonce to be more about girl power (which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, young women may get a lot of confidence from that which is important for their development) than the actual truth of what happens when a couple seperate. Now that this is out of the way I have to blatantly disagree with that statement that her voice is very average. It\u2019s incredible. Beyonce can hit four octaves and while four is a small number in general, anyone who knows music theory knows that this is a huge range. Bruce Dickinson of metal band Iron Maiden and many opera singers can be credited with this, but how many people in the pop world can say they have four octaves or more? Well there\u2019s Mariah Carey at five octaves. She\u2019s unbelievable. Yet i\u2019m not sure I can think of anyone else. Now this is of course on a purely technical level and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what makes a great singer, I mean i\u2019m in the minority that Tom Waits has one of the most unbelievable voices i\u2019ve ever heard because I have a different definition to the masses of what constitutes as a great singer. That being that a singer doesn\u2019t need to sound polished and easy to bare on first listening nor does a singer have to have a particularly high range. A singer just needs to be in control of the notes they\u2019re singing and have a lot of passion in the way they deliver them. And Beyonce is passionate. As much as I don\u2019t enjoy her power fantasies, I do believe they would not work if it wasn\u2019t for how much power her voice has. No one would listen to one of these songs if they were sung by a squeaky voiced mouse. You need someone with command to be able to perform this kind of anthem. She does it well. As for never having a huge hit songs, i\u2019d suggest looking at the numbers. \u201cAll the Single Ladies\u201d is super popular. It\u2019s everywhere. Does that make it good, well that\u2019s subjective. Yet based on your criteria, it has to be. Beyonce has personality and she has presence and she has tapped into something that other artists have not. Her songwriting in my opinion ranges from mediocre to just straight up garbage. So i\u2019m never gonna personally want to listen to her music. Yet I respect her as one of the most talented performers of this generation. ",

            "answer_text": "The reason why Beyonc\u00e9 is so popular is because she connects. That means that for some reason, the magic combination of the way she looks, what music she's released, when she's released it, how well she interviews, the sort of things she gets media attention for, how well she performs live, how hard she is prepared to work and how her overall brand is perceived for some reason makes her likeable. Getting all these things right, all at the same time is what makes her a superstar. You simply wouldn't believe how many people there are behind the scenes orchestrating this stuff. There's a lot of really clued up people who do a lot of hard work to manage all this stuff. Getting it all right, so it all works at the same time is pretty much impossible. Which is why there are so few Beyonces. Also let me let you in on a little secret. Being a \u201cgood\u201d singer is a really common skill. If you give a young teenager singing lessons, by the time they are in there late teens/early twenties so long as they have some natural ability, and some love of singing, they will be a \u201cgood\u201d singer. All you need to be a pop star is to be \u201cgood\u201d at singing. Her backing singers (people who are solely professional singers without all the other bits) will almost certainly be better at singing than her. But they don't have all the other star qualities. So they're not Beyonc\u00e9. If you are only interested in how good a singer is at singing, you should try listening to more jazz music. In jazz, the the actual musicians ability is the only real concern. You'll find much better singers in the jazz world than the pop world as a result. ",
