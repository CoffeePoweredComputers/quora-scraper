            "answer_text": "A2A.  Believe it or not, that is a broad question.  A lot depends on your goals as a violinist, your level, budget, performance frequency, kind of performances, etc. So, \"good\" can have a lot of meanings here. From a professional standpoint (of \"good\"), the cost of a good violin can range anywhere from $10K - $1 Million+ (USD).  Professionals need violins that can handle a wide range of demands (especially if they're a soloist), and that doesn't come cheap.   However, as I mentioned, \"good\" can have a lot of meanings.  If you're an intermediate/advanced amateur, and you don't intend on playing professionally and/or you don't perform often, it may not make much sense to spend $8K + for a violin.  It would be a large investment, with a big return from which you would not fully benefit; you would not be utilizing everything that you've paid for.  Thus, I cannot say that I would consider that a \"good\" investment.   For example, a particular violin may not sound great in high positions on the g-string. However, for someone who only gigs here and there, would you really need that?  How often would you be performing a work that would call for that?  Probably not often.  So, it would make more sense to purchase a violin that sounds \"okay\"/\"decent\" in higher positions on the g-string, rather than breaking the bank on a violin that sounds \"great\" in higher positions on the g-string.  (Obviously, there's much more than this to consider when purchasing a violin; this is just an example.)  That said, there are generally violins in the $4K-$8K range that could manage the demands of an advanced amateur, and violins in the range of $2K - $4k that can handle the demands of an intermediate player.  So that is what I would expect for a \"good\" violin at that point in someone's studies. Now, let's say that you are a beginner.  In that case, I would not spend $4K on a violin. You most definitely would not be maximizing your return on that investment, at least not anytime soon.   It takes a long time to even be able to make a decent sound on the violin.  So, there's no need to focus on getting one of the best violins on the market.  Just find something that gets the job done.  For a beginner, I would say something in the range for $400-$1K is fine. Like most purchases, you want something that has a good quality-price ratio.  So, you should aim for a violin that meets your needs in terms of cost and performance.  On that note, it would be a really good idea to have your teacher help you select a violin. They will know which details to look for, rather than simply checking the price tag. After all, price isn't everything.  Sometimes, you get a good/fairly low price for something that performs well.  (And of course other times, you get what you pay for.)  So, it would be a good idea to have someone with experience assist you in your hunt. ",

            "answer_text": "Defining \u201cgood violin\u201d as \u201ca well built instrument designed to last for centuries, easily playable and comfortable in the hand AND set up by a professional luthier, I would say that you should expect to pay $1,000 to $1200 for such a violin. This does not necessarily mean it will have the sound quality you want or expect but it should function well and produce even, clear tones in all registers. This does not include bow and case. For a good bow, expect to pay $300-$500 and for a good case that properly protects your investment, at least $200. Please note that many featherweight cases will collapse and allow the violin to be crushed by even so much as something heavy dropping on the case, or by falling into a door handle. Accidentally dropping such cases may also result in serious damage to the instrument and the handles and straps on such cases are often flimsy, causing such \u201cdropping\u201d accidents to occur. Be wary of cheap materials in the hinges, hooks and hardware holding your case together. All are accidents waiting to happen. As to sound quality, greater power and tonal diversity almost always cost considerably more. The price can vary too much and the variables are too great for any reasonable short answer. The level of ability and the type of playing (old time fiddle, blue grass, classical, jazz, popular) and personal taste. Suffice it to say that instruments suitable for classical violinists soon headed to music school or conservatory often cost from $10,000 to $30,000 and more and even young professionals are often playing instruments worth $30,000 and up. Those in major symphonies or with solo careers often feel they need instruments ranging in price from $100,000 to a million dollars or more, though there are a few players in world class symphonies managing with instruments valued in the $30,000 to $50,000 range.
