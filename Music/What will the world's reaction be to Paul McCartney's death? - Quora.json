            "answer_text": "While Paul is getting old and has lived a pretty fabulous life I think it will be a big deal when he dies. For many McCartney is almost like royalty and is in fact Rock and Roll royalty. It would be the case of losing probably the greatest songwriter of our generation. I envision massive media coverage and broadcasting the funeral and many tribute shows honoring him and his music. Though the majority of us never knew him personally he has been a huge part of our lives because of his music. It would truly be a case of the day the music died. I think Paul is certainly the most beloved member of the Beatles and millions will mourn his passing. ",
