For instance, imagine a cycle of piano miniatures (or short pieces) where one is 21 seconds long. Even if the album is played in its entirety, that track will count as ZERO streams. That happens to my album Aphorismen. It is 12 pieces. All other pieces have s few tousnd streams, but the second track (21 seconds) has zero streams. Of course, it was played\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t count to the stats (and also not for the royalties). Believe it or not, this simple fact can influence an aesthetic decision. Juan Maria Solare ",
