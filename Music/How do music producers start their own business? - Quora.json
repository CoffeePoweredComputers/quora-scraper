No point spending if you ain't using...see the $200 I wasted on Mac Pro video, great site it's just the digital equivalent of gym membership, you know you should go but you don't cause you are busy with other things ;)  Anyway other than that it helps to be unusual and good at writing all sorts of different genres as that expands your options at the beginning.
