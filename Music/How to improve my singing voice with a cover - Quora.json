            "answer_text": "This is specific to you, so I won't go too deep on an answer, but I'd say your best place to focus would be on support. It'll give you more power and control, and smooth things out a bit. You can sing already, so this'll enhance what you have. Look up exercises for your breathing and diaphragm, and how to use your abdominal muscles to support your voice. Strengthening your diaphragm is probably the best thing 95% of beginning singers can do for their voice. Singing a lot also helps. When I first started taking singing seriously, I played and sang for one to two hours a day to build up my voice. Just don't overdo it and stop if your voice starts to feel bad. ",
