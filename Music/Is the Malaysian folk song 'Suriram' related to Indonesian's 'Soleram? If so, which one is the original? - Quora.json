            "answer_text": "Yes they are related. Riau Malay folk song \u2018Soleram\u2019 is also spelled \u2018Suliram\u2019 or \u2018Suliran\u2019\u2014connecting it to Malaysian \u2018Suriram\u2019. The lyrics varies depending on the sources. The most common version in Indonesian is: Soleram, SoleramSoleram, anak yang manisAnak manis janganlah dicium sayangKalau dicium merah lah pipinya Satu dua, tiga dan empatLima enam, tujuh delapanKalau tuan dapat kawan baru sayangKawan lama ditinggalkan jangan In Malaysia, the most common version is: Suriram, suriram ram ramSuriram maniskuAduhai anakku sayangSuriram jantung hatiku Tinggilah tinggi si matahariSuriram, anaklah kerbau mati tertambatSuriram, sudahlah lama ibu mencari, sayangBaru sekarang ibu mendapat Suriram, suriram ram ramSuriram maniskuAduhai anakku sayangSuriram jantung hatiku Note that this Malaysian version also exists in Indonesia, as are many other versions. A rendering of this song was released by Miriam Makeba in 1960. She seems using a corrupted version of Malaysian lyrics, but it was stated that the song is an \u2018Indonesian lullaby\u2019. Suliram, suliram, ram, ram Suliram yang manis Adu hai indung suhoorang Bidjakla sana dipandang manis Tingi la, tingi, si matahari Suliram, Anakla koorbau mati toortambat Suliram, sudala lama saiya menchari Baruse klarung sa ya mendabat La suliram, suliram, ram, ram Suliram yang manis Adu hai indung suhoorang Bidjakla sana dipandang manis Ulrich Maske included the song in his 2011 album Hoch am Himmel steht der Mond, and stated in the cover that it is an Indonesian traditional song.  Which one is the original? In Indonesia, all those varitions (Soleram/Suriram) exist, so no matter which one is original, all are Indonesian songs. I don\u2019t know the thing in Malaysia, is there any variation of this song? Not that modern render of Faizal Tahir, though. Regardless of the originality, I agree that the song belongs to the Malays. And ethnic Malay is part of both Indonesian and Malaysian, so it is no surprise that we share the song. What we won\u2019t accept is if Malaysian Malay says Papuan song as theirs\u2014this is never happens though haha. ",
