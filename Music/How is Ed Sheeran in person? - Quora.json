            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve not met him (sadly). I\u2019ve seen his number of interviews and this is what I feel - Ed is a cool guy, soft spoken but playful. Usually, he\u2019s genuine about what he says. He doesn\u2019t try too hard and look comfortable. He just is himself (not following the trend what his contemporaries doing). He is very confident with his stuff. He doesn\u2019t over thinks and makes you laugh (Yep, he is funny). When you will watch his interviews, you will feel he is my kind of person and massive at the same time. He literally has no drama with him. He is a big kid with colorful tattoos and sings and writes what he feels ( brutally honest with his music), eat fish and chips (or whatever he likes), gets really drunk and has fun! He\u2019s just a relatable person for whom people would be like, \u201cHey! I want to hang out with that guy.\u201d I\u2019ve talked to a person who actually met Ed Sheeran after his concert in Denmark (Divide Tour) and this is what was her experience - We waited outside after his concert for 2 hours. We kind of gave up because it was freezing and someone said there was 99% chance that he already left. Few mins later, some faans were walking really fast and we ran with them and he was there in pajama, pants, hoodie and looking cute af. I freaked out and said thank you so much and he said of course every time I said thanks. I took a selfie with him. It was like he knew how important it was, and he was so down to earth. He took his time to each fan. I\u2019ll end this with - you might not like his music (how could someone?), but you will appreciate the work that he puts into everything that he does and how charismatic person he is. ",

            "answer_text": "Sheeran is a lovely guy. He's a class musician who just plays his sweet songs and leaves everyone with a smile on their face. But it's on social media that he is king of kings. His lead off single was made Single of the Week on more big stations than you can count; he also got Album of the Week and a few \u201cHottest Record in the World\u201d. He is a superstar, but he still maintains that he's just a normal person like the rest of us, which his music definitely shows. He's incredibly lovable for millions of reasons, but here are just a few. He wrote the song \u201c Wake Me Up\u201d.(If you haven't listened to it, you need to.)He is a gentleman. When his girlfriend's heels broke after the BRIT awards, not only did he give her his sneakers to wear, but also carried her shoes for her.He's incredibly talented. He can play the guitar, bass, drums, cello, and piano. On top of how talented he is at singing and writing music for not only himself, but other people as well.",
