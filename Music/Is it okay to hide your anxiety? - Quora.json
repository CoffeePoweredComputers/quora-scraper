            "answer_text": "Sure, it\u2019s done all the time. When people give speeches at weddings or presentations at work they have a few extra drinks beforehand not because they are caught up in the wedding reception or they practice for hours because they want to nail the content of the presentation, they do it to contain their anxiety so it doesn\u2019t show. So it\u2019s a pretty normal reaction, and many anxieties are due to other peoples perception so sometimes hiding your anxiety is a means to an end. However, what isn\u2019t okay is if you are hiding your anxiety from everyone whilst thinking \u2018I\u2019m going okay at the moment, if I can avoid x (insert relevant anxiety raising activity) I will be fine. This way of thinking seems to often result in development of a stack of avoidance techniques/tools. Problem is there is no impetus to change the pattern of avoidance which diminishes even more as time goes by so seeking assistance seems pointless-no need to change status quo after all. As the other poster points out, anxiety does not go away but often becomes stronger so I guess the answer to the original question could be: \u2018Yes, you can hide your anxiety providing that treatment for the anxiety is undertaken in conjunction with learning how to control or cope in the absence of avoidance techniques I\u2019ve suffered with anxiety for over 30 years now and it didn\u2019t magically disappear and I didn\u2019t get treatment for it when I should have. Instead I pretended all was good became an expert avoidance techniques. It all fell apart a few years for me when my avoidance tool kit let me down-but I won\u2019t bore you with the details. Understand that every time you rely on an avoidance tool to get you out of an particular situation, don\u2019t think of it as a win or something to breath a sigh of relief over. A choice has has just been stolen from you and if the pattern continues it may end up controlling many of the important decisions in your life the - lessons you attend, subjects chosen at school, university , pass times, social life, work life achievements etc etc. I\u2019ll revise my answer above above to: Yes, you can hide your anxiety from others but only if you are honest with yourself and treat wider situation as urgent and needing immediate attention Remember also that medication is only a temporary measure and avoidance tool for most.
