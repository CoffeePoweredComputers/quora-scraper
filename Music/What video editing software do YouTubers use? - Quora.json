            "answer_text": "I personally use Premiere Pro by Adobe to edit all of my videos, for work and for personal projects. It\u2019s a fairly cheap and easy software to use, unfortunately you cannot buy it outright but you can get full access to it for $19.99 USD a month. If you do more complicated and in depth YouTube videos with graphics and audio effects, a must-have is Photoshop, Audition, and After Effects, all created by Adobe. You can get access to the whole Suite of Adobe software for $52.99 USD per month. If you are regularly editing large productions, it\u2019s a very much worthwhile investment. If you are just starting out and are testing the waters for making YouTube videos, here are some options: If you are editing on Mac OS with a Macbook, or any kind of iMac, the editing software iMovie comes free with any MacOS computer. You can have multiple audio and video tracks, some built in effects and transitions, and the ability to place text on screen. It\u2019s great for getting the feel of editing, but once you start to put together more complex videos it gets a little limited. If you see it as a worthwhile investment, the step up from iMovie is Final Cut Pro X, a $299 USD editing software specific to Apple products. It\u2019s very powerful and allows you to do much more advanced edits with a full color grading suite, the ability to import transitions and graphics, create videos with custom resolutions, and much much more. If you are editing on Windows, a great free option is DaVinci Resolve. There is a \u201cStudio\u201d version that costs $299 USD, however the free version is more than enough for basic video editing. The color grading suite is one of the best in the industry, and it\u2019s a very simple yet effective layout, with the ability to edit resolutions up to 8K. Hope this helps, if you have any more questions feel free to drop them below and I\u2019ll see what I can do. ",

            "answer_text": "The type of software that YouTubers use varies according to the niche of their channels, or more exactly, to the amount of editing that they need. If you film talking head videos mostly, video editing software with a splitting tool basically meets your needs. For example, the YouTube video editor. If you are a professional video editor and produce things like Hollywood blockbuster videos, then you need not only an advanced video editor, but also some motion graphics compositing software, and even some 3D modeling software. Here I introduce software that meet different editing need. For entry-level and intermediate users Wondershare Filmora9  Filmora is a YouTube video editing software that any user, including the beginners, can use to creator pro-like videos as it\u2019s the user interface that is really intuitive and easy to use. Additionally, it has so many built-in presets like titles, graphics, overlays, filters, and the transitions of great variety. For YouTubers who don\u2019t create motion graphics or animation themselves, this is a great option for making YouTube videos. The appearance of this software looks pretty cool as well as those built-in presets. Pros: Easy to useCompatible with win and macSupports 4k video editingAdvanced video editing tools (reverse and speed control, color tuning, green effects, PIP, voice-over)Cons: No motion trackingiMovie  iMovie is a classic and well-known free video editing software. What you can do with this software includes not only basic editing like trimming, cropping, and audio editing but also slow-motion effects and Time-lapse. However, you may have limited control when applying these effects. Pros: Having a mobile versionTotally free and easy to useEasy to useCons: Only compatible with macOS and iOSLimited control of editingFor Professionals The above-mentioned video editing software certainly won\u2019t meet all requirements of the high-level users or professionals. so, here is a more advanced option, but advanced video editing software needs high-end hardware. DaVinci Resolve DaVinci Resolve video editor is a free video editing software that integrates advanced video editing features. It has its own workflow. It is the only solution that combines professional 8k video editing, industry color grading, stunning visual effects, VFX, and audio post-production all in one software.

            "answer_text": "Content is King The type of software that you use doesn't really make a difference. This means that you can use Final Cut Pro 7 or X, Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid, Sony Vegas, iMovie, Windows Movie Maker, Youtube's editing software or don't even edit. If your content is compelling enough, you will have no problem getting views.  If you want a more professional look, it comes down to more of the lighting and audio quality as well as the camera and editing techniques used. The more professional softwares certainly lend themselves to facilitating creativity but once you are at the prosumer level of software, it has more to do with where you like your tools, how you like your windows arranged or Mac vs. PC. They all have subtle differences and there are plenty of websites and videos dedicated to the arguments but you'll ultimately have to try them out yourself to find what you like best.  If you are still looking to go a step further, you should get into motion graphics software like After Effects, Cinema 4D, Maya, Smoke, Nuke, etc. Adding motion graphic intros, lower thirds or even just textural effects can really make your videos pop. Similarly, look into color correction and grading with DaVinci Resolve.  I've switched over from FCP to Premiere and After Effects a few years ago after finding myself hating FCP X. I use a 2015 27\" iMac with 32gb of ram and lots of plugins for the lots of programs I use! The best advise I can give you is : just keep making videos and don't ever stop. The more the better. Work with lots of people and try to learn from every experience, even when you get frustrated.  ",

I will run down a small list of these that I have and sometimes still do use while running my Pok\u00e9mon card opening YouTube channel. I will start with the easiest and cheapest since you are just getting started.youtube\u2019s built in video editing software (creator studio).It's free to use, they also have free guides to teach you how to use this.They offer music options.Auto quality fix for the videos.Remember that YouTube can do nothing but benefit from helping you achieve your goals of becoming a huge \u201cbig name youtube channel\u201d. It is a win win for them :)Microsoft\u2019s Movie makerVery, very user friendly and free with Microsoft subscriptions.Has multiple video overlay templates for special effects.Get to use all Microsoft text editing tools and text format tools from all the other programs.Has auto conversion and upload options, very easy to set up.Imovie (for mac/iPhone or iPad ) - my personal favorite for a lot of different types of videos.Has preset movie or trailer options.Easily record from your apple device and then upload with no wasted time.Can add music from the device your using or even different cloud softwares.Allows for easy cuts/ music clipping/ intro making and many other things!When your finished just click save video and upload to YouTube directly, your device, a cloud software or share across multiples contact lists.Adobe premierThis software is really great once you get past the learning curve! But there is some time needed to learn the features.Good thing is that if you are familiar with adobe, this is not much different from other softwares.Allows all of the above features plus wayyyy more!Bad thing is that if you run this on a PC the editing can take a substantial amount of time, the download of the finished video could take even longer. :/Well that's about all I have for input on the topic for now, but would definitely try each and figure out which one you like the best. \u2026.. one other thing, I do use adobe photoshop for all of my YouTube video screens. I find using a template and sharper images can really draw in some new traffic for your views and subscribers. ",

            "answer_text": "What video editor app do YouTubers usually use? what video editor software do YouTubers use? what is the best video editor software for YouTube? There are many variations of the similar question on different sites and quora itself. As a 10-years YouTuber, I used and reviewd lots of software, I will try my best to blend my experience with those suggestions. Every video has both an audio and a video component. Therefore, you need a software which can do actually two types of editing. 1. Video - The purpose of this step is to optimize what your viewers see. In this step, you need to edit your source video footage, you'll do things like remove unwanted content, trim video image, add text, add subtitle/intro, add graphics, add end screen text, adjust color, etc. 2. Audio - The purpose of this step is to optimize what your viewers hear. The audio quality of your videos should not be taken lightly. Poor audio quality really detracts from someone's viewing experience. In this step, you'll do things like add amazing background music, add a voiceover to specific parts of your video, fade in/out, etc. So I recommend YouTube Movie Maker for all YouTubers, it's an unique video/audio editing and maker software made specifically for YouTube. with it you can do above two types of editing well, and get the best profile YouTube videos, and even you can use it to make lots of YouTube videos in parallel from a customized template. And for professional production studios, I recommend to plus Adobe After Effect for making the advanced special effect in video. And please remember, once you completed your video making, save your video as a MP4 video file, and include your main keywords for the video in the file name. This can help your video rank higher in search results for your main keywords. Thanks for giving your precious time. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Jainam, I have a YouTube channel and I have always used the professional tools to make my videos stand out and never spent a single penny! So let\u2019s get straight into it! Recording: There are different types of YouTubers, some make gaming content, some make vlogs/vines and some make Android/Windows Tutorials. PC Gaming: Most YouTube channels are based on gaming nowadays. The best software for recording games is Fraps. But if you don\u2019t have a good PC capable of recording games at good frame rates I suggest you to buy a HDMI recording unit.Vlogs/Vines: For this category you should use a DSLR, if you don\u2019t have a DSLR any SmartPhone with decent camera will work.Android/Windows Tutorials: For android AZ Screen Recorder is the best in my opinion. For Windows Ice Cream Screen Recorder works like a charm!Editing: For Editing I have always used Sony Vegas Pro 13. It\u2019s easy to use, has great features and is best for YouTube. It also supports Chroma Key which can be used to add a lot of fancy effects. A lot of people also recommend Adobe Premiere Pro but in my opinion the features in Adobe Premiere Pro are not needed for a YouTube video. Definitely use Sony Vegas Pro 13.Thumbnails and Logo: Always remember Thumbnail is a very important part of a video. Good video with a bad thumbnail stands no chance! I personally use Photoshop CS6 for all the image editing work.Lastly, I\u2019d say, it takes time to learn all the editing stuff, but once you learn it, it becomes very easy to make quality videos and earn views.

So if you are beginner than you should start with this.This is also on same level with camtasia but slightly better its a completely video editing software the reason I\u2019m saying it better because most of the filters are by default are inbuild in this software for eg.lower thirds,intro outro filters etc.The name of this software is Wondershare Filmora and its also cheaper than Camtasia Studio. This one is mostly used by everyone or not everyone but everbody had tried this one and I personally use this because its the best the,name is Sony Vegas Pro 14. But for this software you hve to get accoustomed to this environment basically its a Intermediate level. This one is enough for creating a high quality graphical video or giving your video an advanced level,name is Adobe Premier Pro. But this one a little complex to use as compare to sony vegas.The last two depends on your os names are Final Cut Pro and Adobe After effects I cannot say much about Final cut pro as it only runs on an Apple machine but Adobe after effects its the best and yeah I must say its an advanced level software but used by many youtubers and yeah these two are little costly.I hope it helps you.

According to me,Premier Pro is the most used by most youtubers because It is cheapest yet professionalEasy to useAdobe,so famousYoutubers like Pewdiepie(105 million subscribers) also use premier to edit their videos.This gives you an idea of the usage and power of this app. I have seen many other youtubers with a large number of subscribers(more than a million) using this application. So according to me, if you are thinking about editing videos for youtube, go for Premier Pro.Other apps are fine but are way to expensive for what they offer.You can do almost everything in premier if you are a bit creative. :-) P.S I just started writing answers on quora,so i would be much obliged if you provide me with feedbacks about my writings and consider upvoting/following me.Thank you for reading till here.
