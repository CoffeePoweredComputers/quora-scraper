            "answer_text": "Take me to church by hozier.This song is a perfect literary piece in Itself, and it is written with great poetic flair. This is poetry being sung in an angelic voice. Its  a little complex to understand but every person can interpret it in their own way. It took me a night to figure out what the artist really wanted to say.  \"Take Me To Church\" My lover's got humourShe's the giggle at a funeralKnows everybody's disapprovalI should've worshipped her sooner If the heavens ever did speakShe's the last true mouthpieceEvery Sunday's getting more bleakA fresh poison each week \"We were born sick\" you heard them say it My church offers no absolutesShe tells me \"Worship in the bedroom\"The only heaven I'll be sent toIs when I'm alone with you I was born sickBut I love itCommand me to be wellAaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. [Chorus 2x:]Take me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knifeOffer me that deathless deathGood God, let me give you my life If I'm a pagan of the good timesMy lover's the sunlightTo keep the Goddess on my sideShe demands a sacrifice Drain the whole seaGet something shinySomething meaty for the main courseThat's a fine-looking high horseWhat you got in the stable?We've a lot of starving faithful That looks tastyThat looks plentyThis is hungry work [Chorus 2x:]Take me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knifeOffer me my deathless deathGood God, let me give you my life No masters or kingsWhen the ritual beginsThere is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin In the madness and soil of that sad earthly sceneOnly then I am humanOnly then I am cleanOoh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. [Chorus 2x:]Take me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knifeOffer me that deathless deathGood God, let me give you my life ",

And did you lose yourself somewhere out there? Did you get to be a star? Don't it make you sad to know that life, is more than who we are? Grew up way too fast and now there's nothing to believe. Reruns all become it history. A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio, and I won't tell me your name.\u201d Cop Stop - Gavin Degraw \u201cWhen your feathers are soaked and your eyes are too bloody to see, And you pulled every punch that you had but there's one that you need. Then you've waited too long. There's a hole in your heart. And all you've become is emotionally overrun. Wishing wells were made to echo a dime, The consequences are you keep on relying. You've become a run and hide refugee. Baby I'm a cop, stop, put up your hands and surrender to me.\u201d ",
