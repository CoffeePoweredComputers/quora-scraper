            "answer_text": "Okay, so here is what I know about this: I learned this directly from both printed pages and interviews given by the 3 Beatles who were Mr. Bests' bandmates, and also from Mr. Starr, who was not a bandmate of young Mr. Best. Their views and opinions on this have been stated both individual and collectively, and the answer to your question is as follows: Messrs. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starkey have all stated, and rather unapologetically, I might add, that not a single one of Our Beatles have ever even bothered to speak a word to Mr. Best after his sacking, not then, not ever. There has not been one single word passed between Mr. Best and the others since the last day they were with one another back in \u201862, shortly after returning to England from Hamburg, Germany. A somewhat \u2018cheesy\u2019 reason for this quite monumental (IMO) slight came from The Beatles in later years, in the form of \u2018victim reversal', where they said The Band was \u201cleft out to dry\u201d by Mr. Best, who didn't show up for the last two gigs before Mr. Starr could begin his tenure with The Group, thus hindering (as was thought at that time) their chances at securing a recording contract. That was The \u2018Post-Best\u2019 Beatles' reason that led to this decades long (and still going) feud, resulting in a complete cessation of all communication. Now, to be fair about this, one must consider Mr. Bests\u2019 take on the preceding accusatory statement on the \u201cleft out to dry\u201d comment: Mr. Best's point was reasonable, I believe, for after Mr. Epstein delivered the stunning surprise of young Bests lifetime, he was then immediately asked to perform as drummer in the few shows prior to Mr. Starrs arrival in the seat. Per Mr. Best, he did initially mumble an agreement to this request, but upon further reflection, decided, quite understandably, that there was no way he was going to do that lot any favors at all, not now, not ever. And he held fast. Perhaps too fast, for who knows what might have been, had he taken a different stance? I digress. There it is then. Now I totally understand Mr. Pete Best\u2019s reluctance and refusal to complete the few remaining shows, while at the same time, I do not at all agree that it warranted this 50\u201360 year ban on any spoken words between the fellows, who once must've been quite close mates. Thank you for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "I am aware of Paul McCartney did for the Anthology Series/Project, and a huge amount of money was earned by Pete Best from it. Paul has done the right thing after a great wrong was done to Pete Best. This is because John Lennon made a series of slurs on Pete Best, about his bad drumming. Pete Best, is a great drummer, and his family home was where a Youth Club was, The Casbah, made possible by his mother, winning money on the Football Pools, Mona Best (Mother).  Pete Pest is the Hamburg time, started producing a Jungle Drums \u201cCrescendo\u201d, that built up at the session, and became a favourite so much so, the Drums were set-up where the lead singer was traditionally placed, at the front, with Paul and John positioned either sides of him. This \u201cStar Status\u201d annoyed John Lennon, who had made The Beatles HIS Band. The Cavern Club - Cavern Club George Harrison was accidently punched in the face, by a disgruntle Fan of Pete Best, after Pete was sacked, at a Beatles Gig in Liverpool\u2019s Cavern Club. Biography 1963 - Pete Best It has to be said, the \u201cTwo Guitars Sound\u201d of John Lennon and George Harrison, got The Beatles famous, not the Drum and Bass. The \u201cDrum and Bass\u201d was called \u201cThe Backing Track\u201d back in the day when REAL MUSICIANS where around. \u201cRap\u201d is crap to me because we concentrated on Melodies, and Chords. I have a Nottingham City best friend, heavily into Black Music, who loves Rap, and has shown me some very good music, that I do enjoy, so please Rap Fans, take no offence! Pete Best has gone onto American Talk Shows, saying after so much hurt, he is very happy with the money from The Beatles Anthology Series, and he said a great THANK YOU, to Paul, for righting a great wrong made years ago. So to answer the question, I think Paul McCartney did, but I have no memory of the other Beatles meeting him. Sadly, John was murdered in 1980, so never added to The Anthology Series, and after some many hurtful statements about Pete Best, I can hardly think he met Pete. Unfortunately, John was never given the chance to apologise, which he had said sorry to his wife and ex-girl friends, for his violence and hurt he had caused them. One of the best parts of John Lennon, was his ability to see issues/causes in a new light, and to publicly re-examine his behaviour, which he declared openly to millions in Media Events like Talk Shows. I, and many Fans of John Lennon, do love John because he laid bare his Soul, few celebrities now-a-days can do this. I miss John Lennon\u2019s take on issues, it was always heart warming, and to the point, but then ALL of The Beatles are missed too. ",

            "answer_text": "i don\u2019t understand why the other Beatles should have had contact with Pete Best after they made it big. According to a number of sources but most especially the fairly recent and comprehensive Mark Lewisham biography they were not mates whilst in the band and had little in common. Pete Best was not rated as a particularly good drummer and the band were on the lookout for a \u201cdecent\u201d drummer throughout most of the time he was there. The Beatles history with drummers before Ringo was very Spinal Tap with drummers coming and going. Pete Best was a drummer they did not want and they sacked him when they found someone better. I don\u2019t dispute that the Beatles could have dealt with the situation with more sensitivity. Obviously , with hindsight, the timing, so close to achieving fame was poignant but then they might have struggled for another year in which case the Pete Best story is just one of many drummers or musicians who are sacked by a local band. Why would they go to meet up with someone they liked or respected? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and state my opinion on the whole Pete Best thing. First of all, at that time, he was NOT a very good drummer! All you have to do is listen to the Decca audition recordings and the version of \u2018\u2018Love Me Do\u2019 with Best on drums, and you\u2019ll hear what I mean. Second, his personality did not mesh well with the other three. Ringo\u2019s sense of humor, and his outgoing personality complimented and fit well with the other three. Those are the two main reasons he was sacked. And they are very important reasons when trying to make a band tight, and to pursue success. Whether he also left them \u201c\u201chigh and dry\u201d by not showing up for a couple of gigs is another reason, I do not know. And there may have been a little jealousy too, but you also must remember that Ringo became the most popular member of the group shortly after joining, followed by Paul. But their musicianship outweighed any pettiness. As for them having any contact with Best after they fired him, that I do not know either. I do know that they decided to give him some royalties from his work on some of the early tracks on Anthology. That may have been done to avoid any legal action, but he did make some money off the Beatles. The firing of Pete Best has caused controversy since the day it happened. (George Harrison received a black eye from a Best fan at the first gig with Ringo). All I will say in closing is, how many employees/employers have contact with each other after a firing. Not many. Add to that, the fact that John, Paul and George were not very close to Pete to begin with. It was inevitable that it would happen. Besides, can you imagine the Beatles without Ringo? ",

            "answer_text": "It seems as if the only contact Pete Best had with the Beatles after he was fired was through legal papers. After Ringo Starr basically accused Pete of being a drug addict, Best sued him and the Beatles for defamation. Best won an out of court settlement rumored to be in the millions of pounds. That basically allowed him to live off his association with the Beatles until the Anthology was released in 1997 and he received royalties from his recordings featured on that project. The royalties were approximately $4 million. But Best did not have any contact with the band about that project. The terms in which he agreed to let his drumming be heard again were all negotiated by lawyers. This is not too surprising given the shabby way the band treated him, particularly Ringo. It would have been more surprising if they had remained friends. ",
