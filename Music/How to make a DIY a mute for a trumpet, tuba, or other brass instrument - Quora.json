So I suggest that for trumpet and trombone, or other brass instruments with the smaller bells to go to the store and buy a new toilet plunger and just use the plunger part.

            "answer_text": "I never tried. When composers/arrangers specify mutes, they know what they want and they anticipate the sound they\u2019ll get. If my home-made cup mute or harmon mute sounds different, they won\u2019t like it and I will not be able to blend with the rest of the section. Time and effort wasted. ",
