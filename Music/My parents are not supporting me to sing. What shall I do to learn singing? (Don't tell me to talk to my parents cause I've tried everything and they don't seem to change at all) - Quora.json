I wouldn\u2019t wish Miley Cyrus on anyone. If you want to sing for your own pleasure, get some books, you tube tutorials. save up money for singing lessons. The more you pursue your dream on your own, the more it will impress\u2026 or should impress your parents. Watch Rigoletto on movie night and say that\u2019s what you want to achieve. Parents can be hard, but most of it is because their vision of your life sees a different picture, and singers\u2026 or anyone in the entertaining arts 1) rarely make it 2) have a lot of problems with drugs, divorce, and family drama. It doesn\u2019t mean your parents are right, but their vision of your future is not aligning with your vision. So recognize why that is, work to address it. ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend you to watch Youtube videos on singing exercises. It\u2019s just the same as going to a vocal coach. It\u2019s free and you can do it anytime! It'll help you improve on your singing a lot. It\u2019s okay if your parents don\u2019t agree with you on what you wanna do, it\u2019s okay. Sometimes parents are just like that. Just give them time. If you keep doing it and show your parents that you LIKE singing and they see that you\u2019re good doing it then maybe they might change their mind. I would say to just keep going towards your goal. Nothing can stay in your way! Hope this helped you :)! ",
