            "answer_text": " It is still in my head today and has been since Saturday night when an amazing father and son duo sang it on Britain\u2019s Got Talent. It\u2019s on YouTube, please watch and enjoy but be warned it will be in your head all day or longer. The song is \u2018That\u2019s Life,\u2019 by Frank Sinatra. It\u2019s my sister and her husbands anniversary of their death soon. They sadly died within two weeks of each other. This my pinned answer if you get time to read it. Her husband was an all time Sinatra fan and was bowled over when I gave him a Trilogy (cassette edition) of his music from Frank himself! This after being privileged to have been sitting in front of Sinatra\u2019s stool as the curtains opened at the London Palladium. I had been invited by the old but kind TWA Special Services representative Ledger Porter who looked after him at Heathrow. Everyone knew old Ledger! This was a million years ago, cassettes and TWA says it all! :) We even went back stage and joined the man himself and lots of other people in his dressing room for a little party.

            "answer_text": "This is an obscure one, but it\u2019s been in my head since I heard it on my playlist yesterday and by one of my favorite artists: \u201cLove of the Common Man\u201d - Todd Rundgren. It\u2019s from his 1976 album, Faithful. That was an important year for me musically. I was five years old, and just getting into music of all sorts. My mom played top 40 on the radio in the car, so I heard much of what was on then, including Fleetwood Mac, Steely Dan, 10 cc, Yes, Chicago, and ex-Beatles music. At home, my parents played the Beatles, Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Cat Stevens. Many of those artists still mean a lot to me now. Songs I liked then included \u201cRhiannon\u201d by Fleetwood Mac, \u201cThe Things We Do For Love\u201d by 10 cc, and \u201cDon\u2019t Take Me Alive\u201d by Steely Dan. I still remember my mom bringing home Born To Run when it was brand new. My parents didn\u2019t play Rundgren at all, but his music fits into the sound that I remember so well from back then, so it speaks to me. Over the years, I\u2019ve grown to love his 1970s music, especially his landmark \u201cSomething/Anything\u201d album from 1972. Here\u2019s a video of Rundgren performing \u201cLove of the Common Man\u201d in 1978.  ",
