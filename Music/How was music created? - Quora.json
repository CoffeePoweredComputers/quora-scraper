            "answer_text": "If we were to postulate the beginnings of music I would say that nature probably played a huge role in the beginning. I imagine villagers and natives listening to the sounds of rain and thunder as well as the many calls of animals to inspire them to make their own noises. I like to describe music as organized noise. In this definition the more something has an organized sound to it the better it sounds to Western ears yet if it is applied to the roots of music then in essence the act of making any kind of noise could be interpreted as music. The great Philip Glass once described himself listening to the sounds of a traffic intersection as an ever changing soundtrack that is ingrained into life itself. I can only imagine native peoples from around the world doing the same thing to represent feelings and thoughts. I would also say the intimidation factor of percussion also played a large part because these tribes were sometimes at war with each other and what else besides music can get you pumped for something as intense as a bloodshed filled battle. I would say a tribes morale also depended on the unifying aspect of music from traditional dances to war chants and beats. From grunts to stomps music will always be a subtle mysterious thing that we should definitely look for in the world around us. ",
