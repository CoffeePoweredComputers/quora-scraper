            "answer_text": "Well nowadays I have seen that your cuteness/appearance plays only a small part in getting a partner. So, It could be due to the following reasons:- Socially less active - Even if you are damn cute, but you have made an image of yourselves as a person who doesn't want to have more friends or want time with him/herself only, then people will find it difficult to approach you, even if they like you or have a crush on you from inside.Lacking individuality - You might have noticed that people who have a distinct personality are often approached more by people, even if they don't, they certainly do get significant amount of attention for it. So, try to look different from the crowd and have your unique identity. E.g. Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos have their unique clothing style, speaking style and unique mindset for the world. So, allow yourselves to be unique.Repressing ownself due to belief system - It also plays a major role in the quality of social life you are gonna have throughout your lifetime. Belief systems like 'having a partner is immoral', 'what will people say..\u2019, 'i must only focus on my career\u2026this things are uslesss' hold you back from taking action.Comfort zone - As I mentioned earlier, you have to make clear of your values and beliefs. Then, you have to approach alots of people and understand that anxiety, fear and all kind of perplexed emotions that you will have to go through, are a part of having a successful social life. \u201cSo keep failing, failure is a part of long-term success\u201d - Elon muskFear to show off - People have created a wrong mindset that it's wrong to show-off because it might hurt the feelings of those who doesn't have it what you have. But that's sympathy, and sympathy is never a good thing, believe me. Take show-off as pride NOT ego and show to it to the world. Show them what you are good at, like your hobbies, ideas, etc.Hostile aura - I don't know whether you are a spiritual person or not but your aura attracts similar energies. So, cleanse your mind by meditating, and stop reading negative news after waking up and before going to sleep, develope your humor because Humour is the lightest form of energy that is accepted by all, even peace feels hostile to sum but humor is accepted everywhere. So, laugh, smile and spread positivity. AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING A PARTNER IS YOUR BIRTH RIGHT ! ;)",

            "answer_text": "In my copious experience the people I\u2019ve met who think they\u2019re cute are also the kinds of people who are engaged fully only with themselves. There\u2019s no room in their lives for giving and receiving love and affection from another person because all they seem to want in other humans is an admiring mirror. Have you read books like \u2018How to Make Friends and Influence People\u2019? Personal development can help you develop a likeable personality to go along with your cuteness. There\u2019s lots of personal development opportunities on Quora plus Jim Rohn and Tony Robbins to name but a few on YouTube. While you\u2019re out there developing yourself you will likely meet someone on the journey too. ",
