            "answer_text": "Well\u2026it depends on your taste. Both are almost the same in my opinion. I am a huge fan of Ed, and prefer him over Shawn ( probably because I came to know about Shawn recently). And also, Ed is a bit more experienced than Shawn. Shawn has some really, REALLY good songs. Like if you see, his song - \u201cThere\u2019s nothing holdin me back\u201d has an amazing feel to it. His voice is just so magical. Once you listen to the tune, you CAN\u2019T get it out of your head (Well I was unable to get the tune out of my head for days! ). But on the other hand, if you listen to Ed\u2019s - \u201cSupermarket flowers\u201d, you completely get lost in the melody. Every time to listen it. That\u2019s all I can tell about it. It is just lovely. But at the end of the day, like I said earlier, the choice is upon you. Both are good at their own styles. Both are the BEST! ",

It\u2019s just that Ed Sheeran has more experience than Shawn since he\u2019s older and in the industry for a longer period. Otherwise, both of them rock in their own special way. ",
