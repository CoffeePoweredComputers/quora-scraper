            "answer_text": "In the case that you are not signed to a record label, the best option is to self release your song. Hardly do people prefer artist-run-labels. Because it just takes away the point of a record label. That means literary any artist can start his own record label. People get signed to record labels to get maximum clout of their music. If you are freshly starting a record label, concentrate only on your label. I really dont suggest signing yourself up on your own record labwl. So yeah, either get signed to record labels that are decent according to your quality of music/style of music, or create a record label and get yourself a team and focus on getting good artists on your label. If you do decide to release something on your label, send it as a demo and let the rest of the team decide weather or not to release the song without you being the one releasing your own song. In this way, your demo would be treated like any other demo sent to your label. So yeah, the best thing is to release your track under your own artist allias or send it to a decent label. ",

            "answer_text": "Whatever you want .. remember, it is a business, and you are the driver. Treat it as a business. Initially set it up as a d/b/a which will be the least expensive, but along the way you\u2019ll want to investigate other options, i.e., Inc., LLC, etc. You are your own label. Do a name search now so that you don\u2019t have to pay dues later on trademarking the name. Make sure that it is free and clear, then register it. ",
