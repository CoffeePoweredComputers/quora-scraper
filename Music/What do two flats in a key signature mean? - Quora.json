            "answer_text": "When there are 2 flats in the key signature, It means that the piece will be in the key of B Flat. The reason why there are two flats in the key signature is because the Bb scale has these notes:  The first flat in the key signature means that the Subdominant (Fa) would be Eb not E natural. The second flat in the key signature means that the Tonic (Do) would be B flat not B natural. One way to remember how many flats or sharps in the key signature would tell you which key is the piece in is the Circle Of Fifths.  The Circle of Fifths was invented by Nikolai Diletskii in his late 1670's treatise on composition called the Grammatika. In 1728, Johann David Heinichen improved upon the design to bring us the modern version we use today. As you can see this sequence of pitches and keys make it MUCH easier to remember the no. of sharps and flats in a scale mean which key the piece is in while reading the sheet music. EDIT: It could also be in the scale of G minor, I just forgot to mention that to :  G minor In music theory, B-flat major is a major scale based on B\u266d, with pitches B\u266d, C, D, E\u266d, F, G, and A. Its key signature has two flats. Its relative minor is G minor and its parallel minor is B-flat minor. ",

            "answer_text": "Gautam, I can remember the time when I didn\u2019t recognize key signatures just by looking at them. To be entirely truthful (hah!) when you get more than 4 sharps or 3 flats in a key signature I tend to look it up. And this answer is going to suggest that you use an internet search to begin getting familiar with the \u201ccircle of fifths\u201d. Look it up online, perhaps with the word \u201cimage\u201d alongside it, and you will see dozens and dozens of illustrations of circles, divided into 12 parts like a clock, with \u201cC\u201d at the top, where 12 would me. C has no flats and no sharps. To the right (moving clockwise), you see all the sharp keys, in order of the number of sharps in the key signature). To the left, counterclockwise, the same thing for flats. Most circle of 5ths illustrations will tell you the following things for each key: The fifth of that key;The fourth of that key;The relative minor for that key; andThe key signature for that key.Print a copy of one you like, and you never need to ask anyone again to interpret what key a particular piece of music is written in. (If you don\u2019t have a printer, you can copy it out by hand.) Plus, as a bonus, you get a chance to start learning about all the marvelous chord progressions suggested by the circle of fifths. ",
