            "answer_text": "I would have to say : \u201cYou could be mine\u201d by Guns and Roses on their Use Your Illusion II Cd. The drums, Superbly played by Matt Sorum, are super punchy and just stand out of the mix great. (The engineer who got the \u201cDrum Sound\u201d at the studio that day should be proud, and should have got a percent of the royalties as well.) I often use this track to test or set up stereos as I know just how it should sound. and it sounds GREAT! Another would just HAVE to be Crazy B*tch, by Buck Cherry. The bass drum sounds SLAMMIN, and I could probably just listen to it by itself\u2026\u2026.(Not ) If the rest of the song didn\u2019t rock so good that is. it sounds to me , But don\u2019t quote me on it , cause I ain\u2019t said Sh*t , that it is a bigger bass drum , like a 24\u2033 or even 26\u2033 maybe a Ludwig or even Pearl, with a thick single ply head on the batter side (Where you KICK it!) tuned just tight enough to take the wrinkles out of it, and either no head on the other side and a big feather pillow stuffed in it, or another head on it and it is tuned just a little tighter than the batter side, so it doesn\u2019t ring, but gives a little push back when laid into. And my guess would be maybe a sennheiser MD 421 mic on it pulled out into the room a little so your catching the first low frequency coming off the drum. One of the best Bass drum sounds caught on tape, So good you can almost describe it while listening to it\u2026\u2026\u2026..Uh see above. And another would have to be Megadeth\u2019s song \u201cTrust\u201d off of Cryptic Writings\u2026\u2026.Hell just listen to the whole CD of \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d if and you\u2019 re wanting \u201cSome Drums\u201d you are. Okay, So I got to stop writing before I bore somebody\u2026.Again. ",
