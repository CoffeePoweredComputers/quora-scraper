            "answer_text": "Q. What was Louisiana like under Huey Long?  (1) Thanks for the A2A. (2) Firstly, who\u2019s this dude? Huey Long (1893-1935) served as the governor of Louisiana 1928\u201332,then Senator from 1932 until his 1935 assassination. Who Killed Huey Long? (3) As Louisiana honcho, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful action. (4) A Democrat and an outspoken populist, he denounced the wealthy elites and the banks. Initially a supporter of Roosevelt, he eventually came to believe that Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" policies did not do enough to alleviate the issues of the poor. In time, he developed his own solution, \u201cShare Our Wealth\", which would establish a net asset tax, the earnings of which would be redistributed so as to curb the poverty and homelessness epidemic nationwide during the Great Depression. (5) Long's \u201cShare Our Wealth\u201d plan was established in 1934: \"Every Man a King\". To stimulate the economy, he advocated various federal spending. Long argued that his plan would enable everyone to have at least a car, a radio, a home worth $5K. (6) During his years in power, great strides were made in infrastructure, education and healthcare. Long was notable among southern politicians for avoiding race baiting. He sought to improve the lot of poor blacks as well as poor whites. (7) He remains a controversial figure. Critics and supporters debate whether he could\u2019ve become a dictator, or was a demagogue. The Montesquieu-inspired US polity system is a piece of lofty theoretical perfection with respect to the 3-branches-of-government, separation-of-powers, checks-&-balances, Federal-States tension, mitigating Tyranny of the State, mitigating Tyranny of the Majority. The obsession with political philosophy Skepticism smothers the mother ideal. Its greatest strength is also its immutable millstone. The changes that Long throttled in his zeitgeist were dramatic, but nevertheless, still on the tactical plane. Infrastructure works, grand design social programs. Long\u2019s project can\u2019t be replicated today because the US system has been deadeningly ossified, to move transformation of his scale. ",

            "answer_text": "People were not oppressed - but it was the Depression era, and Huey Long did a couple of things to try to lift the state out of the economic doldrums. A lot of children didn\u2019t go to school because their parents had to pay for schoolbooks. He made schoolbooks free. He instituted building and infrastructure projects that put men to work when there was no other work available. A couple of the best known of those projects were US 190/61 - two roadways that were significant in connecting the northern and southern parts of the state at that time. He also built bridges across the Mississippi Red, and Atchafalaya Rivers, dramatically improving transportation in the country. Gravel roads were upgraded to concrete or asphalt. He built a dramatically modern (for the time) state capitol building, putting thousands of laborers to work at the deepest part of the Depression. He wasn\u2019t perfect, or incorruptible, but he put people to work at a time when jobs were few and far between, and that is too often forgotten. ",
