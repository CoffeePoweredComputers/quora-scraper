            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy are folk songs not popular anymore?\u201d I think the argument could be made that they are still very popular. A folk song, as I hear it, is a \u201csong of the people\u201d. It is a song with something to say, it is written by an ordinary person, it isn\u2019t too musically complicated or bloated, and it is easily accessible to many people. The traditional definition of folk music may get a bit more specific, but its criteria for folk music is so specific that no song could ever truly fit it. After all, if folk music requires that no one knows the original songwriter, how could one possibly write and release a folk song today? it\u2019s important not to write off a genre so easily, especially when its influence still persists to this day. Take, as an example, Take Me To Church by Hozier. This easily accessible song with a (debatably) clear message became an unintentional \u201csong of the people\u201d. The White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army contains perhaps the most infectious melody penned in the past 30 years. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Alright became a modern civil rights anthem upon its release for its use at Black Lives Matter rallies. Sure, none of the examples above make use of sparing instruments, no drumbeat, and imitation-hick vocals, but I don\u2019t see those as a requirement. There\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with that, in fact I answer questions about folk in particular because I love it so much. It\u2019s just that that particular iteration of folk music, the one it took when it first became nationally popular, isn\u2019t the flavor of the month just yet. Folk music is not dead, and it\u2019s certainly not unpopular. It just doesn\u2019t want you to recognize it all the time. Squint your eyes, though, and I\u2018ll bet you can spot it. ",

            "answer_text": "Folks songs were very real . They lamented things and were a form of peaceful expression and reflection on society. These days, music has been reduced to people dragging around pre made loops and beats, layering mindless lyrics and packaging it up as a \u201csong\u201d. Music will only improve and become meaningful once again, if we stop consuming this stuff and demand quality- real music, from real people, who play real instruments and write from deep within their hearts and souls.
