            "answer_text": "I'll try to answer this as impartially as possible. Here goes: Performance: Mamamoo: They give me Bigbang vibes, chill with the choreography but they hype the crowd immensely. I would pick their concerts over the other girlgroups any time.Itzy: They have a strong stage presence and their stamina is amazing! They also have great facial expressions.Twice: A girlgroup known in the Kpop community for consistency. Even with their back breaking schedule, they always give good performances. They're worth the money.Red velvet: Good performances but nothing out of the ordinary. Seulgi and Wendy are amazing performers and they're usually made to carry the entire performance.Blackpink: A pretty disappointing set of performers who are not able to carry the legacy of YG's top tier performers who showed the art of performance to every kpop group today. Pretty inconsistent and some of their best stages do not even stand next to Mamamoo's mediocre stages. I have very high standards of performance and this is why it's kind of hard to stay as a blink.Vocal: Mamamoo: The best kpop girlgroup in terms of vocals today. They're undefeatable and every member is capable enough to be the main vocalist in other groups. Perfect technique and very healthy singing.Red velvet: Wendy is one of the best vocalists of the third generation idols. Seulgi is also amazing, along with Yeri.Twice: Jihyo is a wonderful vocalist but she should be given more challenging songs. Twice has a whole( except for Momo, she needs a lot of improvement) aren't bad.Blackpink: Ros\u00e9 has a good voice but her technique isn't good. Her singing ability resembles Park Bom; she can only sing the middle range notes comfortably. She struggles with high notes and I haven't really heard her lower register. Jisoo also makes her high notes airy and is again comfortable with the middle range. Jennie is fine, she is a good add-on as a vocalist but not anything remarkable.Itzy: I haven't really seen any challenging songs except for Dalla Dalla, which had a challenging prechorus, which Yeji nailed. Lia wasn't able to do it that well but she's improving. We should give them some time.Dance: Itzy: Four out of five members are remarkable dancers, the best one being Chaeryoung. Lia is also decent and is no way a terrible dancer.Blackpink: I love their synchronisation and their one-after-the-other type movements along with beautiful formations. Lisa is a great dancer and the other three are not bad too.Red velvet: Red velvet's choreographies are very memorable and a lot of kpop groups including a lot of Koreans remember them easily and cover them. They have unique moves and the girls are quite synchronised. Seulgi is also an amazing dancer and the rest of the girls are decent too.Twice: Twice's choreography is not that incredible, but it's still something. They also have unique moves but I find the dances a little too bland for my taste. Momo is an excellent dancer, Sana is quite good and the rest are not too bad.Mamamoo: The group\u2019s choreography is slightly easy and it's because they want to sing more, connect with the audience more and do all this with more power in their dance moves. Moonbyul and Solar are very good dancers. Wheein and Hwasa are good too.Visuals: Blackpink: It's very hard to decide who's the prettiest member but for me, it's Jennie. The group's members look like high-end supermodels and each member has her own type of beauty.Red velvet: Another powerful all-visual group. I particularly love Joy and Wendy's looks. All the girls look like models too and when they debuted, they were regarded as one of the prettiest girlgroups.Twice: This again consists of 9 extremely beautiful girls and I definitely love Tzuyu and Chaeyoung's looks.Itzy: The girls are sweet looking but they're not that unique to me. They don't make me go 'Woah!!!!!\u2019 . I personally love Yeji's eyes, like, it looks like it was crafted\ud83e\udd23. Lia and Ryujin have a very soft look.Mamamoo: One advantage these girls have is that every member looks unique as hell! If you're confused between Hwasa and Solar, I'mma punch your face. Just kidding, I have noodle arms. However, I'm not calling Hwasa ugly, but her looks are too strong for me.That's it. This is just my opinion and I hope you appreciate it. You literally can have the opposite ranking and I wouldn't even mind. Let me know in the comment section, upvote, and I hope you know I'm a blink, moomoo and reveluv.\u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Okay so I\u2019ll do this from last to first. NOT IMPLYING THAT LAST IS HORRIBLE. These girls are all extremely talented and there is no way any of them don\u2019t deserve the success they\u2019re getting. Vocal 5. Itzy  Itzy is a great vocal group. They have good range and a great sound that adds to their concept (lia, yeji, yuna) however they still have a lot of work ahead (ryujin, chaeryeong). I AM NOT SAYING RYUJIN AND CHAERYEONG ARE BAD, they just have some room for improvement. Now obviously, Itzy are rookies which means they have plenty of time to grow! Though currently they are the weakest in terms of singing. 4. Blackpink  These girls are phenomenal. Ros\u00e9 being the fantastic singer that she is and Jisoo coming up close behind, they have an amazing vocal line. I feel as if Ros\u00e9 gets so much hate for her vocals when people don\u2019t understand how great she is. Their ranges are more on the higher side while Jennie and Lisa\u2019s fare more to the lower, giving them good coverage. Now, Blackpink still has a lot of time and space to improve. Jisoo does occasionally strain her voice, however they ARE surrounded by professionals, making it harder to make any permanent problems. Jennie and Lisa both have room to get better with their technique but are BY NO MEANS BAD. In fact they are still great singers, and if the other groups on this list weren\u2019t AMAZING, Blackpink would be way higher. 3. Twice  Twice is such a beautifully oriented vocal group. Honestly, all their members can sing with the best ones being amazing. Their range is fantastic and is easier to expand because of their large number of members. Starting with Nayeon, Jihyo and Jeongyeon, they are THE VOCALISTS. Not saying the others aren\u2019t, however those three are on the vocal side. Nayeon and Jihyo having the higher range and Jeongyeon coming in with the lower. Also including Jihyo and Jeongyeon\u2019s vibrato. Now the rest of Twice isn\u2019t bad. Mina and Sana are still on the high side, but Momo, Tzuyu, Dahyun and Chaeyoung have a lot of space to boost their singing. Momos being her tone, hers and Tzuyus breathing and just dahyun/chaeyoung to practice more. None of them are bad AT ALL. Like come one they\u2019re Twice, but the non vocal line can still develop. 2. Red Velvet  I feel bad for this, but I will explain more in Mamamoos. Red Velvet can SING. Their range and tone being ridiculously good and their confidence adding check marks everywhere. At the higher end, Wendy and Seulgi coming in with incredible vocals. I don\u2019t really think I need to explain Wendy, and if she wasn\u2019t in the group, Seulgi would obviously be at the top. Then would come Joy and Irene, followed by Yeri. There isn\u2019t a single member where you wonder why they\u2019re singing weirdly. BECAUSE THEY\u2019RE NOT. Red Velvet is the type of group where if they\u2019re not dancing and tiring themselves out, the singing can warm your heart. Mamamoo Like I said in Red Velvets explanation, I\u2019ll explain why the rankings are this way. As a solo singer, Wendy takes all, however as a whole group I feel as if Mamamoo is better. This is because all members of Mamamoo are godly singers. Wheein and Solar being on top (no explanation needed) and Moonbyul and Hwasa being still incredible vocalists. Their ranges are top tier and technique is great. Overall Mamamoo wins vocals. Visual 5. Mamamoo  Mamamoo preaches self love and they are all so beautiful. But, with the standards being so specific, Mamamoo doesn\u2019t quite fit them. The closest being Solar and Wheein, while Moonbyul and Hwasa are a bit different. Does this by any means make them not beautiful? NO! 4. Itzy  Stunning is what these girls are. Yuna being the pretty visual and yeji with her cat-like eyes, it\u2019s pretty obvious Itzy is gorgeous. Ryujin and Lia come off with cute features as Chaeryeong has sharper ones. I see often people hating on Chaeryeong because of her visuals, but I think she\u2019s so beautiful. The only reason Itzy is lower on this list is because of their varying traits, but I find that is what makes them most stunning. 3. Red Velvet.  Red Velvet make me jealous all the time. After they added Yeri, it just got better. The standards preferring Irene, Joy and Yeri with their own traits making them even prettier. Seulgi and Wendy do get a lot of controversy around their visuals, mainly Wendy\u2019s nose and Seulgi\u2019s eyes/nose. Though, I find all members to be lovely. 2. Blackpink  I actually like Blackpinks visuals the best however I\u2019ll explain it more in Twice\u2019s. Holy moly, Blackpink is stunning. Jisoo being drop dead and Jennie\u2019s cat-like features, while Ros\u00e9s face and Lisa\u2019s alluring jaw-line. These girls are all visuals. I know Ros\u00e9 isn\u2019t particularly liked for her looks, though she\u2019s stunning to me. I feel as if for some reason, each member was put in a different group, they would all take the visual position. Twice Now, the only reason why I put twice first is because they have more room for different features because they have more members. I know it\u2019s really unfair, but basically they\u2019re all pretty it their own gorgeous ways. Literally all of them are goddesses even though Sana and Momo are occasionally not liked for visuals. Overall Twice/Blackpink wins Visuals. Performance 5. Mamamoo  Now I know everyone is like WHAT, but hear me out. Because Mamamoo doesn\u2019t really dance, there isn\u2019t much they can do on stage. Their singing is show-stopping and they are honestly really funny on stage, but because they are basically themselves on stage (lovable jokesters), they don\u2019t have a branded concept that shines on stage. Although, Mamamoo\u2019s stage presence is still very good. 4. Red Velvet  It\u2019s fascinating to watch these girls perform. Because of their varying concepts, it\u2019s nice to see them switch between the two. They shine on stage and show everything that great idols are. The only reason they\u2019re up here is because only recently they have been lacking in in stage presence. Some stages it\u2019s low and sometimes it\u2019s high. Although it does seem to be fixing itself. 3. Itzy  I love watching Itzy\u2019s stages. The performance aspect of it is what draws me in and their aura keeps me going. There honestly isn\u2019t much to say about their performances. They\u2019re are great, even more so for a rookie group and I feel as if they are going to grow world wide. 2. Blackpink  Yes, yes I know they had that period of time where everyone was complaining about their lack of stage presence, but since then they have been improving more and more to the point where it\u2019s really fun. The combination of Jisoo and Ros\u00e9s light vs Jennie and Lisa\u2019s dark vibe really adds to it. They are girl crush. Twice Twice embodies performances. Their stages are really fun to watch, along with their change in concept making it more thrilling. Plus Dahyun and Chaeyoungs rap vibe clashing with the cute concept has its effect. Overall twice wins performances. Dance 5. Mamamoo  Pretty self explanatory. Mamamoo doesn\u2019t really dance. They do actually have a couple, however they are mostly a vocal group and don\u2019t really show their dancing talent. 4. Red Velvet  Red Velvet is a great dancing group. In fact I feel horrible putting them up here. The reason though is because of their inability to show it. Seulgi is an amazing dancer and it shows. Her hip hop style fits her best and you could just watch her and say \u201cwow\u201d, however the rest of Red Velvet has some room for improvement. 3. Twice  As before, I\u2019ll explain in Blackpink\u2019s as to why Twice is here. Twice is a great dancing group. They have Nayeon and Momo, which can really add to their performance. With those two, it seems as if they would be able to do other styles besides hip hop and the idol style of dance. Plus Momo is one of the best dancers in Kpop no question. 2. Blackpink  While Blackpink gets criticized for their dances, you cannot deny their talent. The reason why they\u2019re above Twice is because of the smaller amount of members. This means the ratio of great dancers is higher with only Jisoo being more stiff than the others. They also have Lisa, who in my opinion is the best dancer on this list. She can do contemporary tricks and not just hip hop style which she also rocks. Blackpink also has Ros\u00e9, plus their amazing charisma. Overall, a great dancing group. Itzy This is pretty self-explanatory. Even as a rookie group, Itzy are the best dancers on this list. Chaeryeong coming out on top with Yeji following, Lia being the only one who can improve. The thing about this group is that no one is good, they\u2019re all great. Overall Itzy wins Dance. Bonus: Rap Rap wasn\u2019t asked for but it can be extra 5. Red Velvet  It\u2019s pretty obvious that Red Velvet isn\u2019t a rap oriented group. With Irene not liking rapping and Joy/Yeri no really trained in the area, they are vocal-oriented. This doesn't mean that they can\u2019t improve! 4.  Itzy is a developing group. Ryujin is a good rapper and Yuna is okay, however they have more potential than skill. Ryujin tone is perfect, however her speed and flow is a bit off. 3. Mamamoo  Hear me out! Mamamoo has Moonbyul. As much as they are Vocal-oriented, Moonbyul can RAP. I will explain why they are here in Twice\u2019s. 2. Twice  Twice had that cutesy concept, but Chaeyoung and Dahyun push it to a new level with Momo following. The reason why they are higher is because they have 2.5 rappers while Mamamoo only has one. I know it\u2019s unfair, but these two are still great rappers. The only problem being Dahyun\u2019s and Momo\u2019s tone. Blackpink I think everyone saw this one coming. Blackpink has phenomenal rappers. With Jennie on top and Lisa following, their tone, flow and speed are top tier. Even Jisoo who is part of the vocal line can semi-rap. They are honestly one of the best female rapping groups and I hope that their company will allow them to show their full potential. Overall Blackpink wins rap. So yay! There\u2019s my rankings. I hope they didn\u2019t seem biased or anything but please don\u2019t hate on any of the girls. They\u2019ve worked really hard to get where they are just like your favorites or your friends favourites and I hope you all have a wonderful day! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, this sounds pretty fun so I am answering it. Performance1- Mamamoo LIVE VOCALS? CHECK \u2705 ENERGY? CHECK \u2705 CHRISMA? CHECK \u2705 FACIAL EXPRESSIONS? CHECK \u2705 What else does this group need to be ranked 1 in performances? They have the best Stage presence for the 3rd generation in my opinion.  2- Itzy Although they are still rookies, I would say they honestly have a very good stage presence for a 1 year and a half rookie group.  3- Blackpink/Twice I honestly don't know who to choose. They may be a tie in this category, Since both groups have equally good live vocals and energy, although I may say twice has more charisma on stage, I believe they are a tie on this.   4/5-Red velvet I think they have very good live vocals, but they lack energy which is a very important factor in performance and stage presence. But they honestly keep on improving on their stage presence, especially wendy and seulgi who are very good performers imo.  Vocals1- Mamamoo/Red velvet Pretty much a tie. Don't get me wrong, they both have very good vocalists, and they both sing live very well, so I can't really choose between them. Although mamamoo has more above average vocalists, since literally each member is at least average at best, I would say red velvet's only above average vocalists are wendy and seulgi, but the others are still decent so I think both wins this category.   3- Twice Twice's vocalists are average at best, I would say nayeon and jihyo are above average vocalists, while the others are average or below average, but as a vocal group, they are from average to decent.  4- Blackpink Just like twice, from average to decent, but I would say twice are better since they have better main and lead vocalists. But bp is still good tho.  5- Itzy Itzy are rookies, and they are very dance based and focused, so we still didn't get to see much from them, and they're still a bit struggling with their vocals, but I am pretty sure they'll improve sooner or later.  Dance 1- Twice/Itzy Here is another tie, twice has better main dancers but itzy has better lead dancers and dancers in general, so I would say both are a tie on this.   2- Blackpink BP have pretty good dancers, rose and lisa are above average dancers, while the others are average but not bad. So I would rank them 2.  3- Red velvet The reason why bp is above RV is becuase they have overall more better dancers, since bp has 3 better dancers, also RV is still very good.  4/5 - Mamamoo Honestly, mamaoo has everything needed except for a very strong dance line, but do they even need one? They already have fire stage presence which is more important than dancing to me.  Visual (I am only going to rank based on the visuals of the group and the korean beauty standards, so it is not my opinion becuase I think all of them are breathtakingly beautiful).1- Red velvet (Irene). It is pretty obvious irene is the one who fits the Korean beauty standards the most between all the visuals, despite her height, irene is basically the beauty standards.    2- Twice (Tzuyu) Tzuyu was very popualr during sixteen that she was in the top 100 of the list of the most beautiful women of 2015 and had a very high ranking between the first 20, like even before twice blew up, can you imagine that? That means her visuals were very loved by koreans since she is almost the tall version of irene (for kbs), her only disadvantage was her tan skin since kbs requires pale skin, but her visuals are still very loved anyways becuase there is still lightening and foundations that can make her skin lighter, she has a very clear skin tho.    ITZY(YUNA) can also be tied with twice and tzuyu, since she pretty much fits the Korean beauty standards as well, and her only disadvantage is her tan skin, just like tzuyu in kbs.    3- Blackpink (Jisoo) Jisoo pretty much fits the korean beauty standards as well, but I wouldn't say as much as irene and tzuyu although she still fits it almost quiet well. However, her visuals are usually overlooked by her members\u2019s visuals from international fans, since international fans prefer more western wise faces as lisa or jennie, or softer visuals as rose, but not traditional ones like jisoo, although jisoo\u2019s visuals are still very loved by koreans, but I think koreans still prefer jennie over her and that is the reason she is the most popualr in korea.    4- Mamamoo (Solar) Mamamoo's solar Is absolutely very beautiful, but she got lots of hate for her bared face, and she still doesn't exactly fit the Korean beauty standards, she and mamamoo fit more the western beauty standards and that is why they are still very beautiful for international fans.    And, That is it! I hope my answer was well written enough and not biased. Stay safe y'all, and have a wonderful day! ~Stan HER  ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, so this is mostly my opinion, but I\u2019m actually objectively answering (some might not agree, but it\u2019s ok as you have the right to have your own opinion): Performance: Twice and MamamooI think that both of these groups have an immensely epic stage presence. Their performances never fail to draw the attention of the audience. Both groups execute high energy and charisma, whenever they are performing, and make the audience want for more.   Vocal: Mamamoo and Red VelvetWell, without a doubt Mamamoo excel in this field. They have such unique and powerful singers that they can easily top this category. Solar and Wheein are really one of the best vocalists I know. Even though Hwasa and Moonbyul do not have a prominent postion as vocalists, but they still have extremely beautiful voices. However, I think that Red Velvet is an equal contender in this category. Their vocals shine more than their rap does (I\u2019m not saying that their rapping is bad, it\u2019s just barely average compared to other rappers and their skills). Vocalists like Wendy and Seulgi are just utterly phenomenal. And also Joy and Irene have great vocal textures. So, it\u2019s a tie for me.   Dance: ItzyOk, so Itzy really have a beautiful dance line among the others mentioned (if you\u2019re thinking about Momo, Lisa and Seulgi, I must correct you here as the question asks for GROUP, not individual members. Individually these three are amazing dancers, but the average of their groups dance ability is not as good as Itzy). Itzy has 4 out 5 super amazing dancers. The only one, which is Lia, is slightly an above average dancer (but she is tremendously improving. If you think otherwise, then you should really check out her dancing in NOT SHY).  Visual: TwiceWell, every group is beautiful in their own ways. No one is superior than the other, that\u2019s why rather than ranking their beauty I\u2019m just gonna put my female ultimate group, Twice here (and ironically they are actually known as the visual group, but I\u2019m not completely sure though). So, for me I\u2019ll choose Twice (the other groups are also extremely beautiful and my opinion is just random. If you don\u2019t agree it\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t come at me just because I chose my ult), because everyone loves their ult group than the other groups and I\u2019m not looking at any korean standards, this merely my opinion.  Bonus Rap: BlackpinkOk, so Blackpink actually has an extremely strong rap line. They have tough rappers like Lisa and Jennie. Both of them can eat someone alive just with their raps. And also I want to mention Jisoo here. That girl has true potential to become a rapper. I\u2019ve seen her rap Jennie\u2019s rap in D4 and lemme tell you she killed it. So, I think Blackpink\u2019s strongest point is their rapping.  ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest I see them as Red VelvetMamamooTwiceItzyBlackpinkRed Velvet has amazing stage performance, vocals, and amazing dances. I love their songs they sound so good and I love how every comeback they come with a different concept! Mamamoo has amazing stage presence and vocals as well. Their raps are so good! Twice has really nice vocals and I love their dances as well. My favorite being Fancy and Likey. They have such good vocals while singing live and I love their raps they are quite good as well live. Itzy does have good stamina especially for younger girls. I am not the biggest fan of their dances but they are pretty cool and look pretty difficult to do. Their raps are alright as well they have a good flow & rhythm. They also do sound pretty good when singing. Although I am not a Midzy and I am not the biggest fan of them they are pretty talented. Blackpink is ok. Blinks might come at me for this but their stage presence isn\u2019t the best. They lack a little bit of stamina they look very tired. On vocals Ros\u00e9 is a good singer but she uses a really bad technique that strains her voice and that is not healthy for your vocal cords. I personally recommend she should try head voice it is a much healthier technique than the one she is currently using, and won\u2019t damage her vocal cords as much as she already is. Jisoo is pretty stable while singing live and she is also very beautiful, it is obvious why she is the visual of the group. For rapping I feel like they yell and scream into the microphone a lot. I\u2019m not hating on it but it would be nice if they weren\u2019t yelling. Plus they need to have a better flow & rhythm it just seems a little lost sometimes. Lisa\u2019s dance is alright she is a really good dancer but sometimes she does end up looking a little stiff. They really should do a little bit more difficult dances I mean there dances kinda look a little bit easy I prefer the ones from their debut days except the one in Boombayah because they cultural appropriated with the Native American rain dance and I think it\u2019s kinda disrespectful. I am not a dancer and can\u2019t dance because of knee and back issues but I\u2019m pretty sure I could do these dances if I tried. My friend did the dance for Ddu ddu ddu at a talent show at school and she made it look very easy she was very good at it. Well that\u2019s it see y\u2019all later! ~Atiana \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc9c ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll try to make this ranking as unbiased as possible! Putting someone at last doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t talented, but they are weak in comparison to the others! Vocals: Mamamoo: Mamamoo as a group are undoubtedly one of the best if not the best female vocal group. All four of them are above average singers, including their rapper. Solar and Wheein are both one of the best female vocalists.Red Velvet: From the vocal analysis\u2019 I have read, Wendy is one of the strongest female vocalists, better than solar, who is usually regarded as the best vocalist in mamamoo. But since this is the group as a whole, they are below mamamoo. Still, they are one of the best female vocal groups.Twice: Twice is not nearly as strong a vocal group as the above two. Jihyo is a decent main vocal, though not the best. Jeongyeon is also a pretty good singer as far as I can tell.Blackpink: None of them are strong vocalists, they\u2019re a pretty average vocal group. They have really unique voices though!Itzy: Itzy isn\u2019t necessarily a group that focuses on vocals, they\u2019re more dance based. But they\u2019re still rookies, so they still have a lot time to improve!Performance: Mamamoo: Easily the group with the best stage presence here. Performance isn\u2019t only about dance, that\u2019s just a small part of it. A lot of performances are without dances. Mamamoo\u2019s stage presence is literally mind blowing, both when they\u2019re not dancing, and when they are. They make each and every stage their own, and are excellent at engaging the audience.Twice: Twice makes every stage so fun to watch. Momo\u2019s and Jihyo\u2019s stage presence is really really good, they really embody each concept they get. But twice aren\u2019t very good also singers.Blackpink: I think everyone knows that when blackpink want to perform, they perform. And at that point they\u2019re possibly better than twice. But that\u2019s the problem, when they WANT to. Half the time it feels like they don\u2019t even want to be there, I personally feel thats wrong. I get that it\u2019s exhausting performing the same 10 songs over and over again, but if fans pay to come to see you, it\u2019s the artists responsibility to deliver. There are obviously exceptions, like when an artist is injured, sick etc.Itzy: Itzy are just rookies but their stage presence and dancing is insane. They all have good stage presence, and are also good dancers.Red Velvet: I was debating who i should put at 4, but i ended up choosing itzy. Honestly all 5 of these groups are amazing performers. Red Velvet are the 2nd best live singers, but i believe that the other 4s stage presence is better, eventhough red velvet\u2019s is really good.Dance: Itzy: As a whole, Itzy is definitely the best dance group. They have 3 main dancers, that speaks for itself. They have one of the hardest choreos in girl grous, and are also one of the most synchronised ggs.Twice: This may be shocking, bcs they have really easy choreos. But the energy that they put into those choreos is amazing. Momo is an amazingn dancer, easily one of the best in kpop.Red Velvet: Red Velvet has harder dancers than twice, but twice has more synchronization and energy. Seulgi is also one of the best, and red velvet of a whole is a really good dance group.Blackpink: Lisa is a really good dancer, so is Rose. But their danecs as a whole aren\u2019t that good. They\u2019re quite simple, and also repetitive.Mamamoo: Mamamoo is a group which doesn\u2019t focus on dance, but vocals. Their dances are really simple, and don\u2019t have much of an impact.Visual: Twice: I think they are the best in terms of korean standards; all of them are considered stunning (which they are) and there\u2019s not a single member who doesn\u2019t fit the standards.Blackpink/ Red Velvet: I couldn\u2019t pick which one fits them more, so they\u2019re both on one rank. Like twice, they all fit the standards, and there\u2019s not a single member that doesn\u2019t. But their visuals are just not as strong as twice\u2019s.Itzy: In my own opinion, Itzy are all beautiful, but korean standard wise, one of them is not. She got a lot of hate for it which is absolutely ridiculous, no-one deserves to be hated, especially if its just for their face, who no one has control over. Also wth she\u2019s so pretty?Mamamoo: They\u2019re my second favourite group over here visually, but they dont fit the standards. They\u2019re known for going against the standards, and they really do.Rap (Bonus): Blackpink: Everyone knows they\u2019re going to be number one. They\u2019re easily the best out of these 5 ggs, and also considered to have a good rapline in female groups as a whole.Mamamoo: Yes, I know that mamamoo forte isnt rapping. But if you really think about it, they\u2019re a four member group, and the one member that is a rapper, is called one of the best female idol rappers, so it makes sense to put them here. She can also write her own lyrics, which is why i consider her an actual rapper.Itzy: They aren\u2019t the best, but ryujin is pretty good, especially since she\u2019s a rookie.Twice: I don\u2019t think any of them would be considered good rappers at all, but i can\u2019t say that since i know nothing about rapping.Red Velvet: SM groups\u2019 weakest aspect is literally always rapping, because they\u2019re known to have the best vocals, and also the best dancers (although nct\u2019s rapline is quite good)Thanks for reading!!

            "answer_text": "According to me, Vocal: MamamooRed VelvetTwiceBlackpinkItzyI do think Wendy is the best vocalist in here, however if we look at the groups as a whole, this is my ranking. Tbh out of these only Mamamoo and Red Velvet are up for debate. My opinion would be, although Wendy is better than Wheein/Solar (depends on who you wanna take as the main vocalist), Solar/Wheein and Hwasa are much better than Seulgi and Joy (especially with Joy and Hwasa). I think Mamamoo can also harmonize better, also with Moonbyul hitting those low notes. Moonbyul's recent cover of trying to say goodbye has also led me to believe that's she better than Irene and Yeri. Further more, the trio of Wendy, Seulgi and Joy isn't as balanced as Solar, Wheein and Hwasa, and can't do the high note harmonies that Mamamoo does. Still pretty close, though. With twice and Blackpink, I think Jennie needs a huge lot of improving. Considering that we're pitching Jennie against Jongyeon, Blackpink is ranked lower. I think Twice's vocally weakest member (Momo) is weaker than Blackpink's vocally weakest member (Lisa), but Blackpink can't do what Twice can do(wether it be the whole group or just 3mix). With itzy\u2026most of them are decent to below average to me. Rap: Mamamoo/ BlackpinkTwiceItzyRed VelvetI think it's a tie between Mamamoo and Blackpink. Although I think Moonbyul is much better than Jennie (Moonbyul is extremely versatile, can write (most credited girl group member of 3rd gen), and the emotions she puts in her raps is insane), I think Lisa makes it up by being much better than Hwasa, and one of the best lead rappers (since lead rappers aren't usually that good). Wheein has potential, Jisoo does too, just not as much as people make it out to be(she literally slurred over everything in that d4 rap, it's not rapping, it's her trying to rap one of the songs she's heard hundreds of times). With Twice, Chaeyoung is a really good rapper to me. Although I don't really like Dahyun's rapping, I think she's decent. Rapper Chae deserves more and more. With itzy\u2026their raps are okay, tbh. It's not like me, who doesn't rap, wouldn't be able to rap their raps once I've learnt the lyrics. I think Ryujin has great potential and the swag required, just that I haven't seen much except talk-rapping. The other members in itzy are decent rappers so that's a great point, but I still think it's just fast talking and/or talking in beat and tune. Red Velvet, the main rapper herself doesn't like rapping. Sure, their raps are catchy, but also something probably most vocalists could do. I prefer Joy. Wendy has potential. Dance: ItzyBlackpinkTwiceRed VelvetMamamooItzy is pretty obvious, they're one of the best female k-pop dance based groups out there. With Blackpink, although I'm part of the Lisa-not-best-dancer gang (no hate, I just think that title belongs to Minzy or Chaeyeon), Lisa is amazing, and so is Ros\u00e9. All in all a great dance line. The others are decent, which makes them second. With Twice, I think Momo is the best dancer in here (for this comparison), but the number of the group's average dancers brings them down. Mina, Jihyo, Tzuyu, and Sana are great. Seulgi and Irene can dance all over me, honestly. They're extremely good, however, unlike the groups above, they aren't in sync most of the time. Wendy is great though. Mamamoo has two very weak members, but I think Wheein is extremely underated. She's almost (*almost*) on the level of the top 3 main dancers. Sleep on your bed, not Wheein. Moonbyul's laid back style makes it harder for me to judge, since I'm not an expert. Performance: MamamooBlackpinkTwiceRed VelvetItzyMamamoo and dreamcatcher 3rd gen queens of stage presence!! Yes!!! Mamamoo can just stand there and captivate the whole audience, they don't need to even dance. They're also one of the better groups at crowd interaction and hyping up the crowd. All of them has individuality and great charisma, and I think Solar and Hwasa are one of the best female performers (k-pop 3rd gen female) out there. Wheein also had a huge charisma upgrade during Hip. If Wheein hasn't caught your eye yet, just watch her performance of 7rings and moderato, and watch her become your ult bias. Moonbyul is really good at hyping the crowd up and all moos die for her. They had such great presence as rookies, that when they performed at shows as rookies, senior said that they didn't act or perform like rookies at all. With Blackpink, yes they are inconsistent, but when they come for our wigs they just come for it. We hand it over. Debate over. Lisa is also one of the best performers out there (in same category up above). Jennie is great on her days, and Jisoo needs improvement. I don't have much to say for the others, Itzy are too focused on dancing those hard choreos that some of them lose the stage presence. Visuals: Red VelvetBlackpinkTwiceMamamooItzyCompletely debatable, my opinion. If we look at the visuals, Most beautiful to me: JisooSolar (since beauty is subjective, the ones listed below Solar don't appear that beautiful to me)IreneTzuyuYunaMost attractive to me: Solar (she's the sun goddes and no one can change my mind)Irene (Irene popped off in Monster and Naughty, couldn't take my eyes off of her for a second)Jisoo (needs stage presence)Tzuyu and Yuna aren't really pretty or attractive to me, but wait.. NO they aren't overrated visuals, they are visual goddesses in South Korea, they just don't fit my standards (which don't really exist but you know what I mean) So here goes my ranking. Please remember that it's my opinion, and yes, I listen (not just title tracks, most of their discography and special stages) to all these groups, so I'm not guessing. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer this question based on my opinions. I\u2019m trying hard not to be biased, since Blackpink is one of my fav groups. Sorry if not everyone agrees with what I wrote, but this is what i think: VOCALS: 1: Mamamoo I never really heard much of their music, but after listening to them singing and doing vocals, i was very impressed. They are super skilled and have great vocals. 2: Red Velvet The members have very good vocal ranges and have great trills. Their voices are powerful sometimes, and calming and melodious at other times. It\u2019s really beautiful. 3: Blackpink Blackpink have very pretty vocals. They can sing different song genres beautifully and their voices fit well with numerous concepts. Not all the members are specialized in vocals, but those who are, sing very well. 4: Twice The Twice members have melodious and soothing. They sound very sweet, beautiful and make me feel happy. I think that their voices sound prettiest when they sing songs like What Is Love. 5: Itzy Itzy has pretty good vocals ad their songs go well with their voices. I wouldn\u2019t say that all their vocals are amazing, but they are good. DANCE: 1: Blackpink Their dances are really nice. They are all above average dancers. I would say that Lisa is one of the best dancers in 3rd Gen Kpop. Rose is also good. Jennie is pretty good. Jisoo has improves a lot and she is dancing well. On Lisa\u2019s channel, Lilifilm Official, she does dance covers that are really good and she showcases her skills really well. Lisa is very good at showing different expressions and she is a very versatile dancer. 2: Red Velvet Red Velvet\u2019s dancers are all skilled and they have a good flow of movements. Red Velvet is really good at capturing the vibe of their song and implementing that on their dance. Seulgi in particular has great versatility and her technique is pretty consistent. Irene and Wendy also dance very well. Joy and Yeri, in my opinion, are the dancers in the groups with the least skill in dance, but they both dance really well. 3: Twice The Twice members are all very good dancers. Their dances in MV\u2019s are usually not too complicated and are pretty cute and somewhat simple, but out of MV\u2019s, they have done very pretty and skillful dances. Momo is one member who is especially good because she has great flow. 4: Itzy The members of Itzy seem pretty talented. They are upbeat and dance well. They are very consistent with their dance. The members have a great sense of beat and rhythm. 5: Mamamoo Mamamoo doesn\u2019t exactly \u2018dance\u2019. They do some moves but they don\u2019t dance like the other groups do. Mamamoo is more of a vocal and rap group. Mamamoo has done some simple moves which they executed well. PERFORMANCE: 1: Mamamoo From the performances I have watched, Mamamoo always hypes up the crowd. They have lots of charisma and passion which you can sense from their performances. There performances are entertaining and they have good stage presence. 2: Blackpink BLACKPINK definitely gets the crowd exited. They have a lot of charisma and happiness coming from them up on the stage. They have great expressions and all of them have impressive stage presence. They always are able to maintain vocals and dance while on a stage. They are very fun and entertaining performers and always light up the stage. 3: Itzy 4: Twice 5: Red Velvet (I have similar opinions in performance for Red Velvet, Twice, and Itzy. They are good performers and have a decent amount of stage presence. But they don\u2019t have enough charisma as the others. They could have a bit more enthusiasm. But they are still very good performers.) VISUALS: (for the visuals, remember, I am NOT saying that some girls are prettier than others. All the idols are queens in their own ways.) 1: Blackpink   2: Red Velvet/Twice (i honestly can\u2019t decide)     3: Mamamoo/Itzy (i can\u2019t choose)     -Minnie Park ",

            "answer_text": "I love these questions! DANCE: 1 - ITZY  They are all amazing dancers, even Lia has improved so much this comeback. They have the strongest dance line out of them all here. 2 - Twice  Twice also have an incredibly strong dance line. Their lead dancers can easily be mains and even their weakest dancers are above average. 3 - Blackpink  They also can dance over average. Lisa and Ros\u00e9 are really amazing dancers and Jennie and Jisoo are also improved dancers. 4 - Red Velvet  They are all amazing and have you seen Irene?! She\u2019s a goddess at dance. Finally happy she\u2019s getting to prove she\u2019s more than just a pretty face 5 - Mamamoo  I think dance is their lowest point. Not because they\u2019re bad at it, but just they do better in the other categories and dance is their weakness. VOCAL: 1 - Mamamoo  They are all amazing vocalists and could easily be mains in different groups. Even Moonbyul who\u2019s the rapper is better than some other mains out there. Wendy easily beats all of Mamamoo but one person can\u2019t carry the whole group so therefore, Mamamoo have the stronger vocal line. 2 - Red Velvet  They are all vocal queens. They could also be mains. Even the rappers can sing well. 3 - Twice  They actually have really strong vocals. Jihyo, Jeongyeon and Nayeon have exceptionally got the best vocals of the group. Absolutely amazing! 4 - Blackpink  They all can sing well. Even Lisa\u2019s vocal aren\u2019t so bad and improved a lot. 5 - ITZY  I do think vocal is their lowest point but even then, they still reach high with their vocals. Lia, this specific comeback, has proven she\u2019s main vocal for a reason. STAGE PERFORMANCE: 1 - Mamamoo  They really know how to keep a crowd hyped! They\u2019re really enjoyable to watch perform. 2 - ITZY  They are amazing live and are only rookies which is incredible! They deserve their Monster Rookie title! 3 - Twice  Definitely well learnt and experienced with live performances! 4 - Blackpink  Coachella is one thing that really let out their true stage presence! 5 - Red Velvet  Amazing Live. They aren\u2019t bad at all but the others above are better. Visuals (my preference, not Korean standard) 1 - Red Velvet  My favourite visuals in kpop! 2 - Mamamoo  I love their visuals a lot! 3 - Blackpink  They\u2019re all so stunning! 4 - Twice  The visual attack is high! 5 - ITZY  I prefer the others\u2019 visuals over theirs but keep in mind they\u2019re all still most likely going through puberty. They\u2019re going to be beautiful women in the future! ",

            "answer_text": "Sooo lets get it! Vocals- Red velvet- wendy and seulgi take em all. Whenever I hear their vocals its like they're singing to me. Their voices hit deep through my heart.Mamamoo- Ugh same with red Velvet their voices pierce through my heart. Especially wheein's her voice is like a blissful phenomena like honey its so rich and viscose.Blackpink/Twice- PLEASE I LOVE ROS\u00c9'S VOICE. I think they Just need some improvement. Rose's voice is like a Disney princess she just strains her voice sometimes.Twice as a group sounds great. Nayeon Jihyo and Jeongyeon basically carry the group's vocals. I really LOVE Nayeon's vocal color it makes me so happy.Jihyo's vocals are SO powerful she has a really powerful voice.Itzy- They are still rookies they need time to shine and show off their fulk potential.Dance Itzy- Itzy are all great dancer lmaoo 4/5 members are in the dance line.Twice- Twice has really amazing dancers like Momo and Mina. Their lead dancers Nayeon and Tzuyu are amazing too. Jihyo can be a main dancer in some other grouo if she wasnt in Twice. You can't deny twice has a Real strong dance line. Twice is a dance based group. Their choreos too UGH! HAVE YOU SEEN FANCY AND FEEL SPECIAL CHOREO LITERALLY DEFINITION OF ICONIC.Blackpink-they're a smaller group but all their members are really good at dancing especially ros\u00e9 and LALISA. Its my opinion but I think Lisa is the best dancer in 3rd gen.Red Velvet- They are all fine dancers but they are rarely in sync with each other.Mamamoo- Mamamoo dont really focus on dancing they mostly focus on their vocalsPerformance Itzy/Twice- Because of their strong choreos and Charisma their performances and are always eye catching. Yuna being a 16 years old has a phenomenal stage presence her stage presence is one of the BesT. Nayeon is the nation's center like Im totally biased towards nayeon but ooffff her stage presence radiates happiness. Jihyo momo and sana give killer expressions when performing too. Jihyos stamina is INSANE.Blackpink- Yeah people will be triggered now here comes the blackpink hate club 123\u2026lmfaoo anyways Blackpink is just a 4 member group but woww they really put on great stages like HAVE YOU SEEN COACHELLA. Lisa has the best stage presence out of all the girls mentioned in the list like her stage presence is ILLEGAL. The girls know how to work a crowd.Red velvet and Mamamoo- Im gonna get dragged for this but lmfao both their performances are usually boring its mainly because red velevet are never in sync and mamamoo don't really focus in chroeos like their stage presence is good but choreos pay a huge role in shaping and visualising a performance.even their MAMA hip performance looked so incomplete individually they all shined but as a group there was something missing it looked very bland and awkward to me.Visuals- BlackpinkTwiceItzyRed velvetMamamoo",

Itzy doesn\u2019t really have much vocals theirs a lot of rap In their songs but when they do sing it\u2019s pretty decent. Dance TwiceItzyRed VelvetblackpinkmamamooTwice and itzy are very good at dancing. Red velvet can dance good. Blackpink members are ok at dancing, they abuse their upper body strength. Mamamoo doesn\u2019t dance THAT much but when they do it\u2019s normally soft and easy moves. Visuals Red velvetTwiceMamamooBlackpinkitzyAll of them are gorgeous, I\u2019m just going by my type and preference. Performance TwiceMamamooBlackpinkred velvetitzyTwice performances are very entertaining and epic especially with their catchy songs. Mamamoo vocals and style makes the whole performance perfect and amazing. Blackpinks lights and outfits makes the stage look hardcore. Red velvets cheerful songs make the performance to cute and fun to watch. Itzys cool vibe makes their stage so hyped and energetic which is so fun and they make you want to jump up and down.

Dance: Itzy: is this even a question here Bruh they hands down are a group with a strong dancing suit Twice: Since you know i said about the lip sync thing they don't have to worry a lot about vocals so their dancing skills is pretty great BlackPink: Lisa and Rosie (there end of this,naah Jk) Lisa and Ros\u00e9 both have great dancing skills and also the other two, Jennie and Jisoo. Jennie has a grt potential to be a lead dancer, however jisoo sometimes may seem stiff RedVelvet: I didn't know whom to choose to put at 4th mamamoo or red velvet. RedVelvet members are great dancers as well but ye still, (Idk what to say lol) Mamamoo: Well they don't really dance a lot on stage but still great dancers . . . . Visual BEAUTY IS SUBJECTIVE RedVelvet:A group filled with visuals love em all BlackPink yes two groups at first (Ik i am very indesicive )Blackpink also a group filled with visuals all of em\u2764\u2764\u2764Mamamoo: queens of breaking the typical beauty standardsTwice: i thought that Nayeon was the visual heheItzy: also really pretty girls but they didn't catch of attention at first",

            "answer_text": "I like all of these groups, out of all of them BLACKPINK would be my favorite. I mean I hope this isn't biased, if it is,im very sorry BEST PERFORMANCE: Mamamoo takes center stage. I feel like Mamamoo always give it there all and they are one of the few groups that really knows how to hype up a crowed. VOCAL: Definitely Red Velvet. They have such a good vocal line and they sound SO good all together, they are all so good that even the rappers have AMAZING vocals. I think that red velvet is very underrated and definitely deserves better. DANCE: Imma say itzy for this one. As far as i\u2019m concerned none of these GROUPS are that special when it comes to dancing . I would say BLACKPINK\u2019s Lisa and Twice\u2019s momo but I can\u2019t pick a group for one individual. I think Itzy is doing very good as a rookie group and I feel like they have some addictive choreography like Yuna\u2019s move with her neck and there hip move on Wannabe was really good. VISUAL: BLACKPINK have this one wrapped around there fingers. I feel like BLACKPINK has the perfect group when it comes down to visuals, all Members have different kinds of looks like Jisoo is more of a Korean beauty, Jennie has more of like a cat look, Rose has a very (from what iv\u2019e seen) rare resting \u201c don\u2019t talk to me look\u2019\u2019 and Lisa has a round yet surprisingly small face shape( its the cutest thing ever) (lol). If I sounded mean or biased i\u2019m sorry. ",

Even tho wendy is the best Vocalist in both groups combined, but as a group mamamoo is better, let's take it this way- between solar and wendy, wendy wins. Between wheein and seulgi, wheein wins. Between joy and hwasa, hwasa wins. So overall as a group mamamoo has better vocals. 2.redvelvet 3.twice 4.blackpink 5.itzy Dance- 1.itzy 2.twice 3.mamamoo Now even tho mamamoo doesn't have an exceptional dancer like seulgi, momo or lisa, as a group they have no dance holes, can you believe hwasa is the weakest among them? 4.blackpink 5.redvelvet Stage presence 1.itzy 2.mamamoo Stage presence is not about dancing, but rather how you dominate the stage and how you make the audience's eyes glued to you, and mamamoo can really do that even with very simple dance steps. 3.twice 4.blackpink 5.redvelvet Visuals- 1.redvevet 2.twice/blackpink 3.itzy 4.mamamoo That's bout it.
