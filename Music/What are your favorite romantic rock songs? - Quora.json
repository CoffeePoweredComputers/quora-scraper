            "answer_text": "Oh, this has to be #1. From the album, \u2018Ellis Island\u2019 by \u201cThe Paupers\u201d, 1968. I present: \u201cThere Was Another Man\u2019s Hair On My Razor\u201d:   Although the obvious choice, I believe it would be followed closely by this tear-jerker, also from 1968, by those troubadours, \u2018St. John Green\u2019. It is the self-titled \u201cSt. John Green\u201d:   Ah, they were such crooners. And, I\u2019m sorry, but I would be remiss not to include their smash hit romantic ballad, \u201cCanyon Women\u201d. (It was simply too hard to decide between the two of them):   And since the question asks for song(s) plural, how could I possibly not include this live performance by Rodney Carrington of the classic, \u201cShow Them To Me\u201d:   Yes, yes. Quite inspiring indeed. And saving, probably the most romantic, for the bottom of the list, another by Rodney Carrington, \u201c A Dozen Roses\u201d:   Bottom of the list? No way! Forget that!Oh boy, I\u2019m on a roll now! Woo Hoo! I got lots more. Ooh, ooh, yeah, the classic love song by \u2018Da Vinci\u2019s Notebook\u2019, \u201cCamel Toe\u201d:   Good one, eh? Hehehe. Oh, and their other big hit, \u201cInternet Porn\u201d. You\u2019ll love this\u2026uh\u2026one\u2026oh no\u2026no\u2026no, no, no\u2026really?\u2026ohhhh\u2026oh dear\u2026you may have to look it up yourselves\u2026 \u201cHey! You! It\u2019s me. Lori! Wake up! Wake up! You\u2019ve been sleep-writing again. Bad sleep-writing. And this time\u2026Well, I just don\u2019t know what to think. Thank goodness I got to you in time!\u201d Oh, hey Lori. Flotboozle! Did I get carried away? \u201cAlmost. But then you always were a hopeless, incurable romantic.\u201d ",
