            "answer_text": "Ok, so seeing all these positive answers \u2013 I\u2019m first going to kinda dash your hopes. Unless you fit the standard of beauty most people apply to KPOP, or have a strong backing, or are extremely skilled in either dancing or singing, chances are you\u2019re not going to succeed. I know I\u2019m being cynical here, but you must understand the being a KPOP star is a life commitment. Even if you do succeed in the audition, there\u2019s no real guarantee that your debut will be successful, let alone actually happen. There\u2019s also the chances of being mistreated by the company, however minor or major that may be. Additionally, your income and ability to live well relies on the fan\u2019s devotion to you if you do not have a strong backing. Fan are basically your life essence as an idol, as they are the ones who support you. Even if your songs are great, you might not hit success. Ok, so now, I\u2019m done with being cynical and am actually going to address your question. Assuming that you understand all the possible outcomes, I would suggest JYP. JYP is know to be the most lenient of the top 3 entertainment companies, as SM and YG have been known to mistreat their trainees. You could try a smaller agency, but if you do so, there\u2019s a smaller chance of gaining popularity since the company you\u2019re signed under does effect your debut. In the end, it all boils down to taste. What is your taste in music? Why are you auditioning in the first place? Each company has a different method of business, style, and ethics \u2013 so you might want to do some research on each one before you actually choose to audition. ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend you to go to the big 3 entertainments. JYP, YG, SM JYP: They are less strict, the founder is nice, open to foreigners, want little more looks than talent, let trainees leave if they change their mind or being an idol, and they are the smallest entertainment out of YG and SM. YG: Very strict, trainee stage will be very hard but it pays off in the end, talent over looks, leave you in the \u2018dungeon,\u2019 and in my opinion the biggest out of JYP and SM. (Lots of people want to audition to YG, so I think there would be more competition) SM: Strict, prepare for plastic surgery if they want you to (since you said you have average good looks, I don\u2019t think they would care,) people say SM is horrible behind the doors\u2026.. My opinion for you: JYP: Yes, go for it. YG: Yes, since you said your a good rapper and dancer and you have over average looks. Downside is you rarely have comebacks, and your trainee life is SUPER hard. SM: No, don\u2019t do this to yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "You should try JYP. Compared to the other huge companies, it is the least strict one. For example, SM mistreats their non-Korean trainees/artists and their artists in general. They have strict diets and schedules. So does YG. But JYP is a company which has enough financial power and treats their artists well. They look for people who have talent but they care about personality as well, Park Jin Young cares about his artists\u2019 personalities. I think if you\u2019re hard-working, talented and determinate enough, you\u2019ll be able to get into JYP. If I was you, I wouldn\u2019t try smaller companies since it\u2019s harder to gain fame if you debut under a small entertainment agency. Good luck! ",

However, YG Entertainment recently debuted a Thai member named Lisa from BLACKPINK, but those are pretty big Kpop companies so you would have a lot of competition, but if you really want to make it big, I would try them out if I were you. Also, SM Entertainment is a big one, but they focus more on looks in my opinion so if you think you are good looking enough. give them a go. ",

They mostly loves people who have exotic above average looks. For them talent can be made. But since you\u2019re good at rapping, i would also recommend that you go to the other two agency.
