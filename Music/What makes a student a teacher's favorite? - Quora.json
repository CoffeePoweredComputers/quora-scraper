            "answer_text": "If you're in school, you spend most of your day in class with your teachers. If your teacher doesn't like you, or you don't get along, school can be extra difficult. Getting on your teacher's good side doesn't just mean getting good grades and sucking up, though. To be in the good books of your teacher you can follow the given steps and make your school life experience more fun and effective: Ask meaningful questions in class. Asking questions shows that you care about the subject matter. It also shows that you\u2019re paying attention. Asking questions is a great indicator of intelligence and a desire to learn.Complete all assignments on time. This one can be difficult if you have a lot of work, or if you tend to procrastinate. However, turning in assignments on time shows your teacher that you are prioritizing their class.Make extra efforts in your work. It\u2019s always good to do more than the bare minimum for an assignment. Extra efforts can include binding your paper in a nice way to make it more presentable, or doing extra research for an assignment.Ask for extra help if you need it. Asking for help shows your teacher that you want to succeed. Many teachers look for this quality in a student, because if you want to succeed you\u2019re likely to take their help and suggestions seriously.Respect the teacher\u2019s authority on a subject. Teachers have been through a lot of education and they have chosen a profession where they get to share their knowledge. You may know a lot about a subject as well, but teachers will appreciate if you treat them as the experts they are.Let your teacher know who you are. Teachers can tell when a student isn\u2019t being themselves. Never try to hide those things just to look like the perfect student.Be helpful to your teacher. Teaching can be difficult, and teachers get tired, just like you. If you notice that your teacher could use a hand, offer to help out. They\u2019ll definitely notice and appreciate your helpful attitude.I hope the information provided by me would be helpful for students to make their school life more productive and become teacher\u2019s favorite.

            "answer_text": "There's a difference between a good student who makes teaching so rewarding, a bad student, who is a class management nightmare, and a favorite student.I won't add anything new to the excellent comments other than my own experiences. My favorites could be a scruffy lost soul one year, and a braggadocios little snot the next year. I can't quantify who tugs at your heart, but what I always sensed was that they needed me more than the others. I don't know if it's done everywhere, but years ago when I was teaching fourth grade, all of the third and fourth grade teachers would meet at a table and talk about kids. Ack!!!! How terrible! In a tiny town there's a history and background knowledge that can support and enhance the learning experience for kids. The discussion would go something like this...Third grade teacher.\"James is from a broken home, he was out of school for months last year, but he's really a tough cookie and bright. He has a knack for stealing little things.\" Fourth grade teacher, \"Is he Mary's boy? I had her older son a few years back. I have a history with her. I'll take him.\"Third grade teacher....\"Annie's a chatterbox, she'll drive you nuts.\" Fourth grade teacher..\"Is there anyone she shouldn't be in class with?\" Third grade teacher...\"Diane! Don't put them together! They'll talk nonstop!\" Fourth grade teacher..\"I'll take them both. They could be my movers and shakers this year!\"Are you following this? As we've all stated many times, teachers are human and like and dislike as others do. Matching to the teacher's personality can be just as positive and productive. Some teachers are mother figures, others strict rulers, others easy going, and some, like me, in the middle. P.S. I love, love, love a kid with a sense of humor!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Number one, don't try too hard. I don't like when students are buttering me up with false flattery to try to gain favor. Just be yourself. Smile and be pleasant in class, but don't overdo it. Do what you are asked to do. Study, do your homework, be prepared for class, interact with the class and the teacher when appropriate. Give your best effort to do well in class. Show interest in knowing the subject being taught and seek to truly understand the underlying concepts as well as the procedures. Ask how the concepts being taught connect to previous lessons and what will be coming in the future so you can link your current knowledge to future learning. Seek help of you need it. If you do understand a concept, offer to help other students understand. Teachers like to know they are helping their students. If the lesson taught was helpful tip you, let the teacher know. If something the teacher did was confusing or did not help you, describe what was confusing and ask for clarification. The teacher can then adapt their lesson to correct this issue in the future. Constructive feedback is always welcome for this teacher. \u201cThat sucked. I don't get it.\u201d is not constructive. Be specific and positive about what you didn't understand and what you think would help you to understand. Teachers are human just like everyone else. We like to be liked. Be an open and true person, and we will respond in kind. One last don't. Especially if your teacher is the opposite sex, be very careful to not do anything that can be construed as a sexual invitation by ANYONE. Getting too close to a student can ruin a teachers reputation, career and life. Even if it is completely innocent, it can haunt a teacher.

What I am about to say is based on my experience of more than 50 years, as a teacher. The students, (who are brilliant; who are extraordinarily brilliant;) are good enough to goad the teachers to out-perform themselves while teaching in the class. They were so intelligent, that I have seen teachers\u2019 knees SHAKING IN THEIR PANTS WHEN THESE STUDENTS RAISED THEIR HANDS TO ASK A QUESTION. But when they left school, they were gone for ever and ever. They neither came to school thereafter; nor in the personal life of the teachers concerned.  On the other hand, the problematic students - are the real headache creators, for the teachers. But there is a plus-point with them. They are the real touch-stone to test the mettle (the true worth) of which the teacher is made. They are the ones, who make this profession really worthy. Invariably, I had these problematic students \u2026.. in every succeeding batch, year after year. I tried the best, that was in me, to get them to right track. I did succeed; but not always. There were some really hard-cores, totally adamant to change. Even to this day, (when they have become grand-fathers), they are their teacher\u2019s pet . ",

A kid like that who tries and especially if they try hard and are successful, a teacher has to carefully walk the line of encouragement and not letting the rest of the kids how grateful you are to have that kid in your class. Of course any time you have one of those epiphany moments with a student and see the light turn on with their new understanding, it reminds and reinforces the reason that you teach in the first place. That develops a love that really lasts for a student. Every coach is waiting for a student who's talent makes them look good. Sometimes it is the kid whose parents are most involved with the classroom or program, unfortunately sometimes it is the kid whose parents throw the most money around. ",

Like everyone else, there are some people whom we connect with more deeply than others. Sometimes, there\u2019s an occasional person whom we don\u2019t like. *As a disclaimer, a teacher should always treat every student with respect and without favoritism*. However, teachers like students who can connect with them on a personal level. Maybe the teacher and student have the same sense of humor, went through a similar upbringing, or are fans of the same band. And, like most other people, teachers get attached to students who share a connection. I know many teachers who keep in touch with former students, and it brings many, if not all teachers, joy to see students succeed on their own paths of life. In conclusion, get to know your teachers and their interests. It\u2019s possible that you may have teachers who don\u2019t have much in common with you, and that makes it harder to find a connection or build one. If that\u2019s the case, talk to your teacher about something interesting about their class, and go from there. ",

They\u2019re under continual stress and a lot of their behaviours towards others are actually quite unpredictable.That being the case, avoid trying to seek likability. I\u2019ve pretty much found out the same thing from my own schooldays over 40 years ago. I\u2019m generally liked by teachers mainly because I try to stay in the \u2018background\u2019 and not be some kind of \u201cclassroom superstar\u201d in either likability or dislikability. ",

The teacher does not consciously like someone more than others, it\u2019s a thing of the heart (a thing of the heart does not mean romantic, by the way). In general, it\u2019s hard for a teacher to like someone that is rude or insolent. Other than that, it\u2019s unpredictable. Even interaction does not determine who the teacher likes or does not like. The teacher sees more than the students think he/she sees. Don\u2019t take it personally, just remember that teachers are humans too. I once liked a student because she reminded me of my sister when my sister was her age; I couldn\u2019t help it, and neither could the student. I don\u2019t even know whether the student particularly liked me or not. I don\u2019t really care because it was at the time, and still is, irrelevant. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to adopt her.

The only thing is reaction,if a teacher react very softly with a weak student or very harshly with a bright student then it is definitely unfair. To help in improving the performance of a weak student, teacher has to become strict.And to boost the performance of bright student,teacher has to encourage him.

Let the teacher know if you have a legitimate reason to miss class (before you miss, if the event is known in advance). Pay attention and do your work in class. If there is homework assigned, do the homework on time. Be genuinely interested in the subject. Be polite. I guess most of this is pretty typical advice. Beyond that, it depends on what level of education you are in and the individual teacher. Some teachers may enjoy staying after class to chat with students, while others want to leave, but are polite and will talk to you. I will say that being an A student or the best academically does not guarantee a student is among my favorites a given semester. ",

I have had bright students with impeccable manners, but I\u2019ve also had weak students with impeccable manners. They don\u2019t have to like me, or stand out academically. One girl said \u2018Good Morning\u2019 - every time she entered the classroom, and \u2018Thank you\u2019 every time she left, for the entire year I taught her. I actually looked forward to having her class, particularly if things weren\u2019t going outside the classroom. ",
