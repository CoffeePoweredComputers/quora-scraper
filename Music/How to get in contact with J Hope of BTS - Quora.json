They will no longer accept gifts from fans. Don't worry, BTS reads ALL of their fanmail so if you use this address the letter will get to Hobi. The only exception is if you try to deliver the letter yourself or through someone else, the letter will not be accepted. ",

They\u2019re getting highly popular which means they\u2019re private information like phone number and email are never going to get leaked. Sure you can go and follow them on twitter and spam their notifications box but remember that probably a million other armies do that to try and get attention. And none of them succeed, so you can\u2019t really talk to Hoseok without knowing him like a friend or a distant relative. Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026 :( ",
