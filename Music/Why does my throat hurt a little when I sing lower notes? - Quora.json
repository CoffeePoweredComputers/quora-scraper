            "answer_text": "Because your vocal chords are not accustomed to hit that low a note. Probably you are singing some extremely low notes that are beyond your vocal range. In my opinion, this is just a phase and as soon as your body gets in the habit of hitting those notes you'll stop experiencing the pain. But, I am no expert and you should consult an expert if you think the pain is unbearable or plan to have a career in singing. ",

            "answer_text": "Your throat hurts because you are trying to reach a note that you've never tried to reach before. Just keep practising, note by note, and you will finally get it. This requires months of practise. But be careful not to strain your voice, just practise hitting them everyday. Effective voice clarity in at least 2 octaves is essential for a singer. ",
