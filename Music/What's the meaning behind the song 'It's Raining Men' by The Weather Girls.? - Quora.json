            "answer_text": "It's a feel-good gospel-like, disco upbeat song.  For me, the phrase \"it's raining men\" means that there is an abundance of [counterparts] about, enough for all, so shake off the blues because you don't need to go very far to find what you're looking for. Amen!  And perhaps something like there's no need for women to fight over another's partner, as is implied in \"Mother Nature [...] taught every angel to rearrange the sky so that each and every woman could find her perfect guy.\"  Moreover, everything is as it should be; the rain too serves a purpose however unpleasant it may be to get caught in it. People often have a negative attitude towards rainy weather, and so they're insisting keep a positive attitude despite bad times (\"stormy weather\") and even if you have a roof over your head, \"rip it off\" because there's no hope of finding the [right] partner for you if you stay in cosy circumstances. If you stay at home, in the dry, you might just miss the chance of finding the [man / woman] of your dreams [outside in the real world].  It reminds me of Yoko Ono's song, \"Every Man has a Woman Who Loves Her\" in which she says \"in rain or shine, or life and death.\" But also, \"why do I roam when I know you're the one?\"  In this case she feels she has found the man of her dreams and needn't look elsewhere.  That particular song was done in a catchy reggae-ska riddim, which she recently remixed into a dreamy, mystical air.  Finally, James Williams  seems to imply that a song with potential will have had to be released under a separate group \"the Weather Girls\"  before it could enjoy the success it deserved. (But maybe I'm wrong, but let's not split hairs, guys.)  ",

            "answer_text": "it\u2019s a celebration of horniness. It uses the theme of the weather to say that there are men as abundant as rain. Great song songs for the gay guys and the women because the lyrics are disposable and at times nonesense. And that is what is so great about it. It means let your cares away and have fun! Perhaps one of you may be able to confirm if the singer Martha Wash (great voice) was the voice behind C&C Music factory? You know the song \u201cThings that make you go hmmm?\u201d This song stays in the psyche because the adult in us gets pissed off with the child in us who loves it. The video is still funny. Black guys in their tight underpants coming down at your focus with an umbrella a raincoats and not much else! It is favorite that has stayed with us over the years It is Homer Simpsons favorite song-Also Smithers seems to like it too. You see Hugh Grant & Colin Firth beating the shit out of each other over Renee Zelwigger (Who can blame them? and who can blame women for getting tunrned on by that) Chandlers Father (A drag queen or is she trans?) on Friends sings that song to them (Chandler admits he was once one of the vegas back up dancers.ink it is one of the great examples of the great pop song. Great tune, dumb lyrics, straight to the point, get in get out, makes u want to lean in and turn up the radio etc\u2026 Musically, it is a wonderful tune. Go get yourself wet girl! (or guy!) ",
