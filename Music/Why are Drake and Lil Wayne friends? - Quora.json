Lil Wayne gets to expand his Young Money label. He's trying to recreate his experience with Cash Money and Hot Boys while staying relevant with a younger crowd. Lil Wayne spend a good portion of 2008 and 2009 hyping up Drake in his lyrics. He's built a solid two pillars in Drake and Nicki Minaj. Drake gets to work with his hero and inspiration. He got the backing of a legit rapper when he was mainly known as a Canadian kid from Degrassi. You can tell from his last few singles that this guy thinks about fame a lot. So it's probably good that he can talk to someone who's experienced it before. They probably have some common ground that helped bring them together. They were both raised by single mothers after divorce. They're both from the South (Drake spent his summers with his father in Tennessee, and Lil Wayne's from Louisiana). They're both big sports fans and use team metaphors in their songs to reinforce Young Money. Some other quotes that aren't from the link above:  \"I almost get pulled out of the show mentally because I'm a fan instantly,\" said Wayne of Drizzy's appearance. \"I scream as loud as they scream. The boy's amazing, and to have him on my team is more than amazing. I'm a fan.\" [1]  Watching Weezy's work ethic gives him plenty of inspiration, even in the YMCMB crew's most celebratory moments. \"It's like if I choose to go after this and go kick it with a woman or go out for drinks, I know I'm potentially slippin' because I have brothers like [Rick] Ross and Wayne that are working nonstop,\" Drake said of his possible post-party plans. \"Me being a kid from Canada coming into this whole thing, being able to observe my heroes do this sh--, it's like all I want to do is work. I just want to make this album as incredible as I can.\" [2] And, now they're going to do an album together and get even richer.
