            "answer_text": "Not \u201cthe majority\u201d, no. First off, the majority of vintage guitars aren\u2019t worth that much in the greater scheme of things. It\u2019d take more than it\u2019s worth to copy a 1950s P90 ES350. There were literally thousands of guitars built by Kay and Harmony and for Sears (Silvertone) that now sell for a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. And finding brazilian rosewood to copy a 1950s Martin guitar is going to cost WAY more than said guitar is going to cost to buy. Well, how about the high buck stuff? The joke has been that Gibson built 1800 Sunburst Les Pauls and 3000 of them are still in existence. But experts are paid to know the difference, it\u2019s much harder to sell a fake LP now than it was 30 years ago. Here\u2019s Joe Bonamassa\u2019s new 60 Les Paul, a one owner guitar he bought from the widow:  Joe B got another one owner Burst Fender guitars, being easier to copy probably get more fakes than Gibson, but fewer are out and out fakes than are just guitars put together from pieces of other guitars.
