            "answer_text": "Oh, heavens no.  It's a comic semi-parody the classic Hollywood swashbuckling epics which almost universally had romantic elements.  Only children (generally young boys) would mistake the romance angle for meaning that a film was meant for girls only. In fact, I was one of those young boys.  Admittedly, the title of the film, coupled with the cover with a couple in a passionate embrace against a gorgeous background screams to young boys that this is not a movie you want to watch.  But then you actually watch it, and that all disappears.  Boys love be the swordfights and the fireswamp, girls love the romance and the strong princess, everyone loves the jokes, which appeal to children and somehow become even funnier as you grow up. A chick flick is a film that's specifically designed for one demographic, and marketed under the assumption that no one else will be interested.  As others have pointed out, few films ever made have the cross-demographic appeal that this one does.  I've never met a guy who watched it and didn't like it, and I hope I never do. ",

            "answer_text": "The Princess Bride is a chick flick in the same way that Mount Everest is a hillock. You could view it that way if you wanted to, but it's so much more. It's a romance, an adventure film, a political thriller, a fantasy. It has torture porn. It has sword fighting. It has magic. It has piracy. It reveals the true identity of the Dread Pirate Roberts and how to survive iocane powder, the fire swamps, lightning sand, death and rodents of unusual size. It has a finely crafted, highly quotable script. It has the greatest kiss the world has ever known (albeit largely offscreen). It has lines that, once heard, it is inconceivable you will ever forget. It has inspired countless memes and an entire xkcd shaggy dog story. It is its own metafiction. The term \"chick flick\" implies - to me at any rate - a generic, modern romantic comedy about sex with some sort of gimmick, aimed mainly at adult and young adult women. The Princess Bride is a unique comedy adventure about love, in a pseudo-historical fantasy setting, which simultaneously cherishes and lampoons every gimmick and trope going, and it's aimed at everyone. So, not really, no. ",
