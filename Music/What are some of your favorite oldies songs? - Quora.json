            "answer_text": "Last week I was introduced to a remarkable female singer which shone since the 70s, Roberta Flack; since then I have not been able to get her voice out of my head. The lyrics of the songs she sang are pretty bold and combined with her voice (and sometimes with another amazing male singer) she produced songs that are pretty touching. These are a few of my favorites:1. Killing Me Softly With His Song (solo)  2. The Closer I Get to You (duet with Donny Hathaway)  3. Tonight I Celebrate My Love (duet with Peabo Bryson)  4. Where Is The Love? (duet with Donny Hathaway)  Edit 20151127: add videos to answer for convenience.",

I sing this a lot, especially at work and my staff think \u201cshe\u2019s off again!\u201d I\u2019ve listed a few because I love music - all types of music - it\u2019s so therapeutic for the mind and soul. Doris Day: Que Sera Sera\u2026. I love it because it\u2019s nostalgic, my mother used to sing it a lot too. It\u2019s one for the girls but it\u2019s happy and uplifting\u2026  Beach Boys: Help Me Rhonda\u2026 my parents would sing this to me time and again because they loved the name! I have also had this played for me many times over the years. But guess what? Who could simply NOT love the Beach Boys??? They were great - superb collection of songs - but this one, it holds special meaning and memories.  Hotel California\u2026 awesome track, I\u2019ve always loved this song a great deal.  Romeo & Juliet\u2026 Dire Straits were yet again another phenomenal band. \u201cSo Far Away\u201d holds magic, as does Brothers In Arms, but I love Romeo & Juliet. It\u2019s an all time classic and simply superb.  Music is one of life\u2019s simple pleasures - it\u2019s just so good to listen to some sounds to put your mind and soul in the happy zone music bestows. ",

Lately, I have been downloading several albums by a chosen artist onto my phone before taking off, and then using shuffle to play songs in a random order during the flight. This results in a new experience every time, due to the unexpected juxtaposition of songs from different albums. This past week, I chose Phil Manzanera / Quiet Sun / 801 (i.e., a good bit of his his non-Roxy Music work). When I was in mid-air somewhere over the southeastern US, the song \u201cWalking Through Heaven\u2019s Door\u201d from the 1978 album K-Scope came up. I used to love this song - but had forgotten it! Apropos to my situation at the time, the song starts off with the narrator describing coming in for a landing on a passenger plane. As I interpret the song (and I could be wrong), the passenger has flown through a time warp and gets off the plane in the future. The rest of the song describes sensations and feelings of experiencing the future as a traveler. I must admit, I was pretty excited to get off the plane after I landed, but alas, it was just Raleigh, NC, in 2018!  ",

            "answer_text": "Make you feel my love by Adele. The song really brings back memories that i will never forget. I was 15 years old then and was in the middle of my exams. Since both my siblings were away from home, it was only me, my father, and my mom. Both my parents are really supportive of me. So, my mother was not home three days in a row and i was confused because not seeing my mother was weird. I thought they had a fight and secretly got divorced but my dad just simply said she was working. Then, the next day i found out that she had a breast tumor but didn't want to tell me cause i was going through serious stress and my ipod was playing and suddenly Make you feel my love came on shuffle. The lyrics to the song really got to me. I felt as though my mom was sitting next to me trying to calm me down. I don't think i will cry as much as i did back then. Life is crazy but it gets better. Trust me. ",

So for the basis on this answer I am going to conjecture and say that you mean to imply that the songs are from before the year 2000. My favourite- Bohemian Rhapsody  Mama, just killed a man Put a gun against his head Pulled my trigger, now he's dead Mama, life had just begun But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters Some others- Ek chatur naar -absolute classic, Hey there Delilah- the old version, I walk the line, Skinny love, I want you to want me, Blue christmas and basically any song by Queen.
