            "answer_text": "Hello there \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f I truly believe that both are shy in their own little way. They each have their own \u201cstage presence\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are braver or more bold than they put out to be. If I had to put my knowledge to the test though, I would say Yoongi, for he gets this shy and \u201ctiny\u201d characteristic about him when he gets on camera without really knowing he would be filmed. Jungkook has his moments of shyness too, but he has been doing this since 15, when he was a child, so he had to grow up a lot faster. He would get shy with being complimented, and stuff like that, so each of them have their level of shyness, but I just think yoongi is a little shyer. ",
