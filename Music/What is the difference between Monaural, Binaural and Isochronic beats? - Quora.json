            "answer_text": "Monaural or isochronic both refer to a sound that consists of only one channel, unlike stereo or multichannel surround sound. Therefore, the term \u201cbeats\u201d doesn\u2019t fit these types of signals, but they\u2019re often lumped together anyway because their uses are so closely related. A binaural beat is a pair of tones, fairly close together in pitch, but not exactly alike. Therefore, when played together, they \u201cbeat\u201d against each other. Guitar players and bass players know all about the universal experience of hearing the sound of two strings that are not quite tuned alike, combining and vibrating a room with a pulsating sound to them. Binaural beats have been found to have an application in consciousness exploration and meditation, among other uses. For this purpose, a \u201cbeat\u201d or discrepancy between two tones is selected to match the corresponding brainwave desired, which for meditation would usually be the theta range: between 4Hz and 7 or 8Hz, depending who you ask. The optimal \u201ccarrier\u201d frequencies of the audible tones fall loosely into the midrange, about C3 (130.81Hz) to D5 (587.33Hz) So a binaural tone pair for inducing a theta brainwave might be one at 340Hz and another at 345Hz. The difference of 5Hz will bring about the \u201cfrequency following effect\u201d when heard through headphones, where the two tones are kept separate and each played into only one ear. This 5Hz difference is why this pair would have value for meditation: 5Hz is in the theta range. This brainwave frequency corresponds to the brainwaves of a person in a deep meditative state. Using the tones in this way has the advantage of zeroing in on the particular brainwave frequency desired. It also works fairly rapidly - around 7\u20138 minutes, in my experience - far less than the months or years of practice and study that go with many more conventional approaches to meditation. It is not necessary to concentrate on the tones, or to play them loudly. They work nicely at low sound levels through headphones, often masked or accompanied by music or other sounds so that they may be almost unnoticeable. One of the limitations of binaural beats is that they aren\u2019t effective for really extreme brainwave frequencies, meaning anything below delta (very low) or above beta (normal waking consciousness). For some of these extreme frequencies, it\u2019s not worth going to the bother of making two tones that are close together in pitch. A single pulsating tone is sufficient. As a bonus, a single pulsating tone would be mono, and not require headphones. In this approach, the tone is selected by the frequency of desired brainwave, and that frequency (let\u2019s say a gamma frequency of 65.41Hz) is the tone that is pulsated. The limitations of this approach are determined by the range of human hearing: we won\u2019t be able to hear a tone lower than 20Hz, even if we provide one, or higher than 20KHz. This is useful mainly because it covers nicely the gamma range, an increasingly weak range for binaural beats technology. We call it an isochronic pulse, since it is not a steady tone but a pulsating one. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, binaural beats, monaural beats and isochronic tones are each a form of(auditory) brainwave entrainment. ... Monaural Beats (above) are similar to binaural beats but get the desired result faster. However, some people prefer the sound of binaural beats over the sound of monaural beats. ",
