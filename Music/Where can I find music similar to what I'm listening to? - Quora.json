            "answer_text": "I've found http://last.fm to be the best so far. You can navigate to a specific band or genre and start a custom radio station from there. The real pull of it for me though is that it monitors every track you listen to in a variety of players and can build up personalised radio stations from there. EDIT: 12 months on from this comment and http://last.fm have killed off their radio player. playing similar artists etc. now plays a stream of youtube clips, ads and all. Whilst I still use http://last.fm I now use it mainly for listening stats. ",

            "answer_text": "Pandora is a great way to control what you like. By adding multiple songs along the lines you want, you can quickly narrow down to a particular genre or style you like. You can also like and dislike the songs that play to refine it more.  You can get a similar experience with Spotify's radio option. What I like about Spotify is that you can add the songs you discover to a separate playlist for your own enjoyment later, rather than giving up that option to Pandora's random one-track at a time approach. They also have a massive library! ",
