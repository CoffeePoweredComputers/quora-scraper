            "answer_text": "Pop music is a type of popular music that many people like to listen to. The term \"pop music\" can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The word \"pop music\" was used from about 1880 onwards, when a type of music called music was popular. Styles of pop music in the 2010s (today) include rock music, electronic dance music and hip hop. Pop music came from the Rock and Rollmovement of the early 1950s, when recordcompanies recorded songs that they thought that teenagers would like. Pop music usually uses musical from the other types of music that are popular at the time. Many different styles of music have become pop music during different time periods. Often, music companies create pop music styles by taking a style of music that only a small number of people were listening to, and then making that music more popular by marketing it to teenagers and young adults. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a type of nightclub dance music called Disco turned into a popular type of pop music. Record companies took an experimental, strange-sounding type of music called New Wavemusic from the 1980s and turned it into pop music bands such as The Cars. In the 1990srecord companies took an underground type of hard rock called Grunge (for example the band Nirvana). Michael Jackson was also a very influential artist for pop music. His album, Thriller, is the best-selling album of all time. He also wrote some other very influential songs, such as \"Bad\", \"Give In to Me\", \"Will You Be There\", \"Heal the World\", \"We Are the World\", \"Black or White\", and \"Billie Jean\", just to name a few. By the 21st century (after the demise of disco in the 1980s)Contemporary R&B became pop music. Examples of Contemporary R&B artists that have a wide pop appeal are Usher, Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Chris Brown and more.

            "answer_text": "Pop music IS just exactly that; a catch-all term describing merely what\u2019s popular in music at any given time. So you\u2019re right that Pop Music, in and of itself, isn\u2019t a genre. But that said, there are enough common threads to many successful popular songs that an overall \u201cPop style\u201d can be gathered from them. These include: Generally well-produced and/or well-recorded, using state-of-the-art facilities and techniques. All things being equal, people want to hear what they\u2019re listening to. So \u201cpop songs\u201d will tend to have clearly intelligible music and lyrics.Vocals featured prominently. Music is a human endeavor, and humans instinctively want to hear other humans making that music. To that end, most popular songs have the vocals front and center, where they can be heard most clearly. Other human-generated noises such as snapped fingers, hand claps, humming and whistling are also interesting to people, and so are often featured in more popular songs.Widely relateable subject matter. People like what they can relate to, and what\u2019s more relateable than love, longing or heartbreak? People can understand at once the frustration of unrequited love Taylor Swift sang about in \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d, the embarrassment of waking up and not knowing what you\u2019ve done like in Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cTGIF\u201d, daydreaming of love that lasts forever like Ed Sheeran does in \u201cThinking out Loud\u201d, or fighting dirty with your significant other like in Adele\u2019s \u201cRolling in the Deep\u201d.Catchy melodies and recognizable arrangements. For all of the \u201csameness\u201d so lamented in modern music, most of the best songs are recognizable within moments, or even instantly upon starting. Whether it\u2019s the quiet organ intro to \u201cGives You Hell\u201d by the All-American Rejects, the gritty blast of guitars on the Black Keys\u2019 \u201cLonely Boy\u201d, or the Gospel-tinged call-and-response between Beyonc\u00e9 and her backup singers on \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d, the same goal is achieved. The artist is announcing to the whole world that what they are about to hear is completely different from what has come before, yet utterly worthy of their listeners\u2019 precious time.Not too long. Speaking of which, the listener\u2019s time IS precious. Most songs are about simple things and basic emotions that can be effectively related in three to four minutes. Take much longer than that and you run the risk of repeating yourself, or even worse: being boring. Getting a song to communicate as much as possible as quickly as possible, saying your piece, and getting out is an art form in and of itself. And given the choice, it is generally preferable to have a song one second shorter than one second longer.",
