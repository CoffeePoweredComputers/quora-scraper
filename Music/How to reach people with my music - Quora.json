            "answer_text": "Congratulations on your composition. Traveling right now, but will get back on your composition after I have heard it. I am myself an amateur composer, got admitted at NYU, rejected, worked at a start up which got acquired by Twitter, and now finally, have got my own start up related to music discovery.  The point I am trying to make is, my start up is my solution to help both me and other upcoming artists to be heard for exactly one thing : our music. But that was my solution, because I want to help others like me too.  As for the first steps, go to soundcloud, start following groups related to the genre you compose, add your tracks to that group, listen to other up coming artist, post authentic comments on their tracks which show you understand their composition and the finer nuances. If someone posts nice bassline on my composition, I would be happy, but if someone actually writes that \" I like the side chaining you coupled with the bassline and the saw lead \" , well I am going to write back to you and listen to maybe one of your songs. I won't write much about my own start up, will defeat the integrity of my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm listening to your song. I like it! You deserve wider listenership, for sure. The big problem is that there a billion other artists out there, many of whom are as good as you. Why should I, a random guy on the internet, want to listen to you instead of to any of those other people? You need a way to stand out, a reason to make you more interesting than all of the other would-be superstars on SoundCloud. I recommend taking a well-known song, and remaking it in your own image. We mostly like to hear things that are familiar to us. If you take an iconic song and sample it, remix it, mash it up, or do an unusual reimagining of it, that's much more likely to grab the attention of strangers. It's even better if it's something that everyone knows and loves, but that hasn't been run into the ground. If I hear your amazing rap over some music from Star Wars or a Mozart aria or some AC/DC or Stevie Wonder, I'm much more likely to stick around and see what else you have going on. ",

            "answer_text": "It's always difficult and can be quite daunting when you want to expand your music out and show that this is your passion. Depending on where you live, I would just be upfront and go to a lounge or a open mic night and just go with it, if people like it, they will stay, and if they won't like it they will leave. Just don't put your focus on the once that leave, place your focus on the fans you get and keep on producing more and more. Meet more people, invite them to your home, become more social. Start new websites, social apps, ask to be put up on Spotify and such. It's also very difficult to just send a demo tape to a record label and expect a reply back, because record labels do get tons of these. But you can also think:What is success?What are my goals?What makes me happy?Is money important?Can I spend all of this time when I am \"made\"? I hope this has helped you Armstrong. ",
