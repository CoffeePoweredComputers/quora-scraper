            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re bad at rhythm, but there are many ways to improve it. I recommend doing some drum programming. This has several benefits: You visualize the rhythms in addition to hearing them. Opening up more than one sensory modality at a time helps your brain engage.You end up listening deeply and repeatedly to the patterns you\u2019re working on.You can make beats that you can practice or perform over, and that you can use for your own productions.Together with my NYU research group, the Music Experience Design Lab, I developed a web-based circular drum machine called the Groove Pizza. Seeing rhythms on the circle reveals symmetries and metrical functions that are invisible in traditional left-to-right notation schemes. Click on the Specials to try out various iconic rhythms, and click Shapes to hear the satisfying sound of different geometrical figures. You can also try some groove challenges with the Groove Pizza. Use your ears and have fun! I also recommend practicing over recordings of actual humans. James Brown is the gold standard\u2014try the Funky Drummer Bonus Beat Reprise:  Hip-hop instrumentals are great for practicing too. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve been practising on your Saxophone for that many years, that\u2019s pretty impressive. From acute observations, I think it is relatively difficult to keep in tempo with woodwind instruments. I have three suggestions: Try a different saxophone or another instrument (related to the saxophone) and see if there\u2019s a difference in your rhythm. Practice percussion, maybe join a percussion ensemble or a group and get help from others who are experienced in rhythm. Practice, practice, practice (practice makes perfect). If it\u2019s still too hard, don\u2019t fret! Observe yourself, even the smallest details - is your heart rate fluctuating causing you to go off beat? Is there a certain pattern you see or notice that causes you to go off beat? Even if you don\u2019t see yourself succeeding, perfect tempo is hard to accomplish. Practice catching yourself on time if you\u2019re off-beat to get back on beat - whether it requires skipping a measure or speeding up a little bit. By the way, props to you for playing the saxophone for 5 years! Hope you do well in your journey in music! ",
