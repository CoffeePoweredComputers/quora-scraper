            "answer_text": "Only the royalties paid through BMI/ASCAP/SESAC can be so split fairly effortlessly.  So long as all the claimants' claims total 100% or less on the writers' side then BMI will pay out per the information supplied to them from one or more sources. Once the claims total more than 100%, nothing gets paid out until resolved or litigated. Similarly on the masters side,  SoundExchange can handle splits once informed. It will take a lot more effort to get HFA monies split. The underlying problem is that any 1 co-author who has not assigned admin. rights can collect all the money on a non exclusive license, albeit with the obligation to account to the other co-authors.

Other than that, unfortunately you usually need to stipulate in a contract who will administer and collect income and distribute to the other parties in a given amount of time.  ",
