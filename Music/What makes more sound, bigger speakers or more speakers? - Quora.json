            "answer_text": "Actually both bigger speakers and more speakers could be relevant but it will not necessarily give you better quality. Better speakers is probably the right answer here. Here are my thoughts, hope to help you: Where more speakers counts:If you want to have best home theater experience, more speakers will usually means better staging of audio in your living room, but it could not be equal to best audio quality reproduction. This would be good for experiencing audio effects of a movie, but if you want to listen to a piece of classic music, may be not (depending on the brand and the overall quality of the speakers)If you want to cover a large hall, it is usually better to distribute speakers than putting one big speaker in front.Where big speakers counts:Where you simply want a louder speaker and sometime better low frequency response, the bigger is better, otherwise the bigger speaker doesn\u2019t mean better audio quality.Where high quality (monitor) speakers counts:If you want the best quality, usually what you need is a pair of good monitor speakers. These speakers are designed to be linear and true to original signal and will reproduce the closest possible audio to the original recorded audio. They are expensive and durable and made for professionals. You may also need to add a sub-woofer to compensate lower frequencies.It is worth to mention that considering the whole chain of the music/audio recording to reproduction chain, the weakest technologies are still on speakers end. For example we are very good on microphone technology and what we could record by microphones, is yet to be reproduce completely with any kind of device including headphones or speakers. Headphones are also far ahead of speakers on this regard. Then if you want to hear the best possible reproduction of a record, go with monitor headphones. It could make a difference if your music player also knows about your hearing capabilities and adopt itself accordingly. Try our stereo EQ on NikooPlayer. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "More sound means more pressure. To get more pressure, physics needs to intervene, and this dictates that you need more surface area. By way of example, a 15\u2033 driver needs to move 5.5 mm out to produce 30 Hz at 100 dB (1m), while a 10\u2033 driver needs to move 12.3 mm out to do the same. Two 10\u2033 drivers can also do the same, but each only needs to move 6.1 mm out (10\u2033 driver has a little less than half the surface area of a 15\u2033). This is one reason you see many large speakers at a live gig. There is something else to be said here - normally, sound level will decrease by -6 dB every time you double the distance away from it. A line array speaker (more speakers) will carry the volume further. You will need to read up about this to get the proper terms and values. I can recommend a quick Google search, or http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-distancelaw.htm ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: If it's the same model speakers than the loudness doesn't usually change that much when going for a fx 15\" speaker instead of 12\". But going for a different, more expensive speaker can increase the loudness a fair bit. Personally I would recommend going for a more expensive speaker instead of many inexpensive speakers. How to find out: If you are looking at speakers from the same brand and model, I would suggest looking at the watts number. fx 200w + 200w = 400w. With this you can easily calculate what combinations of speakers are the most powerful. However if you are looking at speakers from different brands who may calculate their watt numbers differently, I would recommend looking at the db number (db peak) (SPL) instead. If 2 speakers have the same db number, the loudness will increase by 3db. fx 120db + 120db = 123db. But when you have different db numbers you want to add, it gets more complicated so for that I would recommend Google-ing \u201cdb calculator\u201d and use that. ",

I suggest all of these are factors: Amplifier powerSpeaker sensitivitySpeaker bass extension ( see below)Whether or not you use a powered subwoofer, and the peak SPL of the powered subwooferMore speakers can increase SPL, sure, but remember each one needs to be powered, you don\u2019t get something for nothing. Mostly, more speakers is used either for stereo \u201cpresence\u201d, surround sound setups, or in larger installations, for more even sound to a large audience. Speakers size is loosely correlated to bass extension, but there are many variables. For example, the design of the speaker, e.g. bass reflex, driver sizes, and voice coil extension. Also, I suggest using a powered subwoofer, even with typical floorstanding speakers. My advice is based on some 30 years of experience trying different setups at home. ",

            "answer_text": "What makes more sound, bigger speakers or more speakers? Neither! You will get MUCH louder sound if you use MORE EFFICIENT speakers. Some speakers have a sensitivity of about 80 dB per Watt, while others can have up to 100 dB/W this is equivalent to using a 10 kW amplifier compared to a 1 Watt amplifier. The down side is that very efficient speakers tend to be rather \u201cPeaky\u201d in their response and tend to have poor bass response, but this is not always the case. ",
