            "answer_text": "OOOH I love this! Grab yourself a cup of hot beverage or something colder and stronger and and have a seat because I might be here for a while. Alternatively feel free to scroll on by, but I did feel the need to give you a heads up on a full on lengthy sarcastic melodic onslaught! In no particular order and until I even get on my own nerves from rambling on for so long and trying to include as many genres as I can squeeze in\u2026YOU NEVER EVEN CALLED ME BY NAME written by John Prine and Steve Goodman although John Prine never wanted a writing credit on it\u2026there have been a few different versions with different lyric changes so I am including a clip from an interview with John Prine explaining the night it was written, why he didn't want a writing credit and a hysterical story about mixing alcohol in the bathroom sink of Paul Ankas dressing room suite and drinking of the sink. Also including the lyrics to both the original song by Steve Goodman and the later version David Allan Coe had a hit with.    Now I am truly overwhelmed by this next artists wit and honesty, her humility and gratitude but also her ability to turn the bullies taunts and insults into the DONT TELL ME I WON\u2019T SUCCEED. HOLD MY BEER AND WATCH THIS feistiness and never give up attitude. And to all those haters of hers from back in high school\u2026I hope they enjoyed watching her pick up her CMA AWARD for BEST NEW ARTIST last week! This is Ashley McBryde and her brutally honest and comical reply to all of her high school haters from back then.FAT AND FAMOUS by Ashley McBryde. Lyrics Frizzy hair and glassesAt the back of the classYou made fun of me on Friday nightsI was down there in the bandYou were up there in the standsAnd now who's voted 'Most Likely to Hate Their Life'You got fat, I got famousAin't that funny how it changesYou made fun of me for yearsI get paid to play my songsI got a headline gig in AustinYou got a closet drinking problemAnd a juvenile delinquent souvenir from Senior PromI got a Budweiser endorsementYou're re-financing your mortgageHow's it feel to make those payments?You got fat and I got famousYou cheated off my papersAnd ignored me in the hallDrove a daddy's money Mustang around townI drove a rusty pile of tinThat you loved to go by me inAnd loved a lot, like that heap you're driving nowYou got fat, I got famousAin't that funny how it changesYou made fun of me for yearsI get paid to play my songsI got a headline gig in AustinYou got a prayer-chain gossip columnAnd a pack of crappy friendsAnd an ass just like your momMy guitar player says I'm sexyI strum his Tele, when he lets meIt's a bitch the way life changesYou got fat and I got famousYou know it's nice to sing about the truth every now and thenTruth is; karma and gravityYeah well, they're the same thingI got a Budweiser endorsementYou're re-financing your mortgageAin't that a bitch?The way life changes'Cause you got fatand I got famous Songwriters: Terri Jo Box / Ashley Mcbryde / KRISTIAN KAIPER  I have to add this GET YOUR CLAWS OUT GIRLS song called I\u2019LL THINK OF A REASON LATER which was a hit for Lee Ann Womack but hysterically enough it was written by two men! I heard he was gonna marry some girl from DenverThen my sister came over, had the Sunday paper with herThere was the girl on the social pageLookin' in love and all engagedWe decided she don't take a very good pictureIt may be my family's redneck natureRubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behaviorIt sure ain't Christian to judge a strangerBut I don't like herShe may be an angel who spends all winterBringin' the homeless blankets and dinnerA regular Nobel Peace Prize winnerBut I really hate herI'll think of a reason laterI drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a markerChildish, yes, but she made such a thin little targetI couldn't be happier on my ownBut I've got the slightest of a jealous boneAnd seein' her with him tends to enlarge itIt may be my family's redneck natureRubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behaviorIt sure ain't Christian to judge a strangerBut I don't like herShe may be an angel who spends all winterBringin' the homeless blankets and dinnerA regular Nobel Peace Prize winnerBut I really hate herI'll think of a reason laterInside her head may lay all the answersFor curin' diseases from baldness to cancerSalt of the earth and a real good dancerBut I really hate herI'll think of a reason laterWell, it was just one toothDid I mention I don't particularly care for her?She makes me sickSongwriters Tony Martin/Tim Nichols  WRITE YOUR OWN SONGS by Willie Nelson is a defiant KISS MY ASS from Willie to the music executives.You call us heathens with zero respect for the lawWe are only songwriters just writing our songs and that's allWe write what we live and we live what we write is that wrongIf you think it is Mr. Music ExecutiveWhy don't you write your own songs[Chorus)And don't listen to mine,they might run you crazyThey might make you dwell on your feelings a moment too longWe're making you rich and you're already lazySo just lay on your ass and get richer or write your own songs Mr. Purified Country don't you know what the whole things aboutIs your head up your ass so far that you can't pull it outThe world's getting smaller and everyone in it belongsAnd if you can't see that Mr. Purified CountryWhy don't you just write your own songs[Chorus.]So just lay on your ass and get richer or write your own songsSongwriter Willie Nelson.  YOU\u2019RE THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE UGLY Loretta Lynn and Conway TwittySongwriters L.E. White/Lola DillonAnother TELL IT LIKE IT IS girl is Elizabeth Cook. This son is about drunk sex and brewers droop! YES TO BOOTYWhy can't I just let you love meWe've been working all week and it's SaturdayThe weekend rolling round's like a weight off our backYou thought you'd celebrate with an ice cold 12 pack When you say yes to beer you say no to bootyYou holler come on baby why you acting so snootyIf you've slept with a drunk man you understand, it's not that hardIt's common knowledge round hereWhen you say yes to beer you say no to booty I don't like laying the lawI just like some good vibrations that's allWe can't have a mansion or a platinum AmexBut we can have good time and we can have sex...

            "answer_text": "My favorite sarcastic song ever is Cake\u2019s Rock \u2019n Roll Lifestyle: Well, your CD collection looks shiny and costlyHow much did you pay for your Bad Moto Guzzi?And how much did you spend on your black leather jacketIs it you or your parents in this income tax bracket?Now tickets to concerts\nAnd drinking at clubs\nSometimes for music that you haven't even heard ofAnd how much did you pay for your rock and roll t-shirt\nThat proves you were there\nThat you heard of them first? [Chorus]Now, how do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?Tell me How much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar?\nThe one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the showAnd how much will he pay for a brand new guitar?\nOne which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another showAnd how long will the workers keep building him new ones?As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue onesAnd how long will the workers keep building him new ones?As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones Aging black leather\nAnd hospital bills\nAnd tattoo removal\nAnd dozens of pills\nYour liver pays dearly now for youthful magic momentsBut rock on completely with some brand new components [Chorus] Excess ain't rebellionYou drinkin' what they're sellin'\nYour self-destruction doesn't hurt them\nYour chaos won't convert them\nThey're so happy to rebuild itYou'll never really kill itExcess ain't rebellionYou drinkin' what they're sellin?Excess ain't rebellionYou drinkin', you're drinking what they're... sellin' CAKE \u2013 Rock 'N' Roll Lifestyle Hands down, this is my favorite Cake song, though I\u2019m also a fan of their cover of I Will Survive. Still, at the bottom of it, aren\u2019t most teens able to identify with this song? Also reminds me of one of my favorite lines from a movie: \u201cYou\u2019re wearing the t-shirt of the band you\u2019re going to see? Don\u2019t be that guy, man. Don\u2019t be that guy.\u201d PCU ",
