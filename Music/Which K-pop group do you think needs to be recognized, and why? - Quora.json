            "answer_text": "That really does depend, because some people tend to base off whether they pay attention to the group by popularity, looks, talent and even company. But even with all of this, there are some groups that need to be recognized or should be more popular. -Stray Kids. I know they\u2019re a popular group with lots of STAYS, but personally, I believe that they need more recognition because I feel that some people don\u2019t consider them a group and more just a group that\u2019s gonna leave soon. -Loona. Again, they\u2019re popular, but some people don\u2019t see them as a group and are just looking at them for their music and looks. Like, that\u2019s cruel, don\u2019t just look at them because you can. -TXT aka Tomorrow By Together. They are widely known and popular, but everyone sees them as copies of BTS. As an MOA, I would personally know, and I feel like MOAs have to be protective or else they might get overwhelmed with threats or stuff. -BTS. Even though they\u2019re the most popular boy group in the world right now, everyone treats them like they\u2019re not important, oh they\u2019re music\u2019s so good but we don\u2019t care about the members. It really is angering. -Twice. I personally do not like Twice all that much, but I know them enough to know that they deserve more than they get, and that they should have more promotions and more concepts than the ones JYP and others choose. I hope this answered your question! ",

            "answer_text": "DIA   Originally a 7 membered group (different lineup from the photo above!), DIA debuted in September 17, 2015 with the full album \u201cDo It Amazing\u201d, the members back then were: Cho Seunghee - Leader, Main Vocalist, Face of the Group (former member of F-ve Dolls, a sub-unit of Coed School under Core Contents Media or better known as MBK Entertainment)Heo Sooyeon (Eunice) - Main Vocalist, Lead DancerKi Huihyeon - Main RapperLee Soyul (Jenny) - Vocalist, VisualBaek Yebin - Lead VocalistAhn Eunjin - Lead Rapper, Main DancerJung Chaeyeon - Vocalist, Visual, MaknaeAround 2016, they announced that they're going to add Kwon Chaewon (Eunchae), a few months later Seunghee left the group because her contract expired (she was under CCM/MBK longer, she actually said she never wanted to debut in DIA because her contract was already expiring and didn't want to renew, her departure greatly affected DIA as she was the most popular member at the time). Before their first comeback members Jung Chaeyeon and Ki Huihyeon along with trainee Kim Dani competed in Produce 101, Chaeyeon absolutely blew up and was now DIA's most famous member and an I.O.I member, and this is where things would go downhill for DIA. Since Chaeyein is the most famous member, MBK pushed her A LOT, she was often at the center and got a lot of lines, even more than the original main vocal Eunice, because of this DIA was sadly more known as \u201cJung Chaeyeon's Group\u201d rather than DIA. In 2017 two new members were added, Lee Jueun and Ahn Somyi, of course with another lineuo change a lot of fans would be confused and sometimes lose interest because of the group being inconsistent, but 2017 was DIA's best year, their album Love Generation sold well with more than 30k sales (their highest). Members Yebin and Somyi competed in The Unit, here we saw how the girls were negatively affected because of Chaeyeon's popularity (MBK and the Media's fault), they were UNKNOWN while one of their member was SKYROCKETING, they said they wanted to be as successful as Chaeyeon which is heartbreaking. Fortunately Yebin made it to the debuting group and her popularity rose a lot. Now into 2018 we saw ANOTHER member change, Eunjin left the group, this member change negatively affected the group because she was one of DIA's popular members (not as popular as Chaeyeon, but she was popular in the fandom and kpop scene for her dance skills). 2018 was when they got their first (and currently the only) win with Woowoo, this was a very memorable moment for DIA and AID, I can clearly remember how hard the girls have cried. 2019 and yet again we saw ANOTHER member change, this time it was Jenny who left, she was also quite known in Korea for her visuals. They were getting lesser and lesser comebacks, and for their 2019 comeback MBK managed to mess it up by releasing the album late, VERY LATE. Also months later after Jenny's departure, Somyi went on hiatus, with no announcements from MBK everyone was worried. Then suddenly she went live while breaking down and crying, after that nothing has been heard from her (until her instagram return last month, we'll get into that later). 2020 and after 14 long months of waiting, WE ARE FINALLY GETTING A COMEBACK!! But it wasn't what we were expecting, this time 2 members were missing, it's Chaeyeon and Somyi. The comeback sadly tanked and was their lowest charting one, because Chaeyeon was absent. Nobody knew where the 2 members were and we were mad at MBK for being unprofessional and not releasing a statement that Chaeyeon and Somyi would be absent for the comeback, they hid behind the girls. Now September 2020, Chaeyeon has returned to the group while Somyi is active on Insta, but was not present in DIA's 5th anniversary, nor greet the members on their birtbdays. Right now their future is uncertain since their recent comebacks are not performing well especially Hug U, I really hope MBK does shit right and let DIA have another comeback. PLEASE, SUPPORT DIA. THEY DESERVED TO BE RECOGNIZED. ",

            "answer_text": "i will be mentioning an UNDERRATED group. so when i read this question, i immediately thought of one group : onf.  onf was originally a seven-member group. they debuted on august third 2017 under wm entertainment (wm is different from woolim!!) as we all know, wm handles oh my girl and b1a4.. that's just that. it's as if onf is the black horse ; they barely get recognition unlike their seniors. of course they're new, and they've been doing great! all was going well, until a member left the group. laun, the group's youngest, terminated his contract and left the group due to \u2018personal reasons\u2019 on august twenty third, 2019. it confused fuses (fandom name) a lot because laun posted four days before his departure, and the members celebrated his birthday on the eleventh, showing off their friendship. there's also a vlive taken by the group one hour before the departure was announced, and none of them mentioned or even hinted on laun\u2019s departure. what shocked us the most though, is j-us\u2019 statement on the matter. j-us is the group\u2019s leader! We\u2019re also surprised by the sudden departure of Laun. We don\u2019t understand what we should be doing, but we did realize our fans must be more shocked and worried. So we decided to write this. As a team, we have been striving to repay our fans who have been so patient with us. But we know today\u2019s news broke the fans\u2019 hearts. As a leader, I feel responsible. More than half of ONF members have trained for such a long time to accomplish our dreams of debuting as idols. We thought once we make our dream come true, there will be only good and happy times. But sometimes it was hard and exhausting. Today, we learn again that life can\u2019t always go the way we want it to. (translation credits to koreaboo) it's really weird because laun has been very active within the group. posting selcas, being part of isac, acting in a drama n all that.. the thing is, the agency also posted their comeback\u2019s teasers a day before laun\u2019s departure. the thing is, aren't contracts talked over for days, if not, weeks, or even months? i'm not blame anybody, but.. did laun keep it a secret from his members? or did the company kick him out? if so, what's the reason? this was all just fishy. after that, the group didn't come back for eight months. imagine what happened behind the scenes. losing a member was hard, everybody would know that the pain is like that of a family member leaving you. it hurts. the group then came back on october seventh, 2019 with the album \u2018go live,\u2019 \u2018why\u2019 being their title track.  and then, they participated in road to kingdom on the early half of 2020! they competed with other established names, namely the boyz, oneus, pentagon, and verivery. it was like a spark of new hope for everyone in the group and in the fandom.  that's \u2018new world,\u2019 a song that they released and performed in road to kingdom. this got them trending in korea, standing on the top five trending groups with really big names such as bangtan, nct, exo, and seventeen, with onf on fourth place. the song itself placed fifth on \u2018bug music awards\u2019. honestly this song makes me want to cry. it's like, they've moved on from the sudden departure of laun and are ready to take on the \u2018new world\u2019. here's also their collab with pentagon on road to kingdom, a remix of kill this love (original : blackpink ) because i'll never shut up about it \ud83d\ude33  they might have not won road to kingdom (ahhh congrats tbz <3) but then went back home with some fame on their back. after ten months, TEN MONTHS after their comeback \u2018why\u2019, they came back just recently on august tenth, 2020 with the album \u2018spin off\u2019 and their title track \u2018sukhumvit swimming\u2019. honestly the mv teasers were so serious n all that, making it seem like a serious song n look like a movie trailer but the mv itself was all :DD n that escalated quiCKLY. no complains though.  and they seem to be doing well at the moment, coming from a small company and being a rookie! but please, if you can spare some time, please check them out!! <3 i hope they get recognized more internationally, they deserve it. here, have a hwa (\u00b4\uff61\u2022 \u1d55 \u2022\uff61`)  ",

Also check out the other Members solo. They're super talented and I'm in love :) Their debut song is a bop too idk why their earlier song (before they change concepts) is amazing too. I miss them.
