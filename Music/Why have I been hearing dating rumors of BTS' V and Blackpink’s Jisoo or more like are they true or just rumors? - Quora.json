            "answer_text": "\u201cTwo people wearing similar outfits, etc\" \u201cOoh they're dating\" Understandable but also can be quite annoying. Yes a lot of times people would immediately jump to the conclusion that pairs acting like these (wearing matching outfits, holding hands, seen together, etc) are couples. Probably but also probably not. I've been having dinner together with an old friend of mine for 3 nights now but we ain't dating. Two of them were work related talks and another is just a hang out. We saw eachother while shopping and decided to grab a bite. I know how we look like to others (specially to those who don't know us) but we ain't together. Heck he has a girlfriend. These rumours of celebrities dating sometimes is too pushy. If they are seeing someone, so be it. But they also could be not. Dating in general for idols is sad. Most fans would hate the idea of them being with someone and that's disappointing. Not gonna lie, I myself ship V and Suga (sadly an unpopular one but still an existing ship) but I know where to draw the line. These ships 99% of the time ain't gonna happen. If they are indeed secretly dating a member (it's possible) then so be it (good for you if it's your ship) . If they're dating a fan, a friend, another idol, so be it. If they're single, so be it. Let them be who they wanna be. I'm pretty sure even you yourself don't like being told who and who not to date. Same with kpop idols. Just let them be happy in the way they wanna be. ",
