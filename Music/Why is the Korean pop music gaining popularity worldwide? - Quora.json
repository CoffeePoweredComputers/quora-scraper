            "answer_text": "You have to have a fairly liberal and open-mind to embrace and accept a foreign culture. But K-Pop is able to overcome language and cultural barriers because it is simply appealing to many. It may not be as popular in Western countries but its popularity should not be underestimated. In fact, some Korean acts have recently landed near the top of the Billboard Hot 100 which has never been done since the PSY era. How Korean Boy Band BTS Broke a U.S. K-pop Chart Record \u2013 Without Any Songs In English Furthermore, KCON (music festival) - Wikipedia is held worldwide including the US and has been a huge success since 2012 as attendance continues to grow exponentially every year. Another strong indication of K-Pops global popularity is the addition of a K-Pop genre on Itunes. K-pop is already popular in Asia, but the fact that Apple made a K-pop genre on Itunes speaks volumes. Also, it\u2019s not rare to see Korean artists consistently landing the #1 or #2 spot on the Worldwide Itunes album charts in multiple countries [UPDATE] BTS Wings is 1st at the United States Itunes Album chart, they are n1 in 27 countries - Charts and Sales. In conclusion, K-Pop is slowly but surely making progress in the US market. Everyday, K-Pop is gaining more popularity through social media and YouTube. Saying it\u2019s not warrants a little more objective research. ",

            "answer_text": "YES, it's totally true that kpop is indeed gaining popularity world wide with their music type and great mvs. The fan base of kpop is so huge\u2026it's almost popular in 65 countries of the world. Have u ever heard of FOREIGN IDOLS OR TRAINEES\u2026 the trainees coming from all over the world to become a kpop idol. For example LALISA FROM THAILAND,  PRIYANKA from INDIA,[tbh Indians fail to match the korean visuals (until they do not belong to east India) but are indeed very charming in their natural look\u2026 PRIYANKA MAZUMDAR is not soo fair like the way she is looking here but still she has a very vibrant and bright look.(well it depends to person to person.like I really appreciate her look but you may not), according to me she has never taken any surgery for her looks like most of the idols do get and that's the best thing I like about her].  JACKSON from CHINA,  , TIFFANY from AMERICA  , LAY FROM CHINA.  This might be hard to digest but it's true that kpop companies look for foreign trainees more than their own Korean trainees\u2026 (ya when it comes to choosing visuals they will obviously look for their own country or will look for countries where they can find Korean visuals)because the country from which u belong ,will recognise you and will start following u on social media which will obviously increase your and your group's fandom and popularity and the examples I gave u above they all belong to successfull idol groups. And have u ever noticed that most of the kpop companies(not all, but almost all) put one or two foreign idols in their debut groups to increase not only the groups but the companies reputation and help in getting success. And when they debut their idols they make sure to mention in their debut teaser posters the nationality of the foreign idol. And that's why kpop gains popularity soo easily\u2026 And that's why Korean pop has a huge fan base, because of its diverse industry. Thnx for reading \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc31 bye\u2026 ",
