            "answer_text": "Finding a good bookmark manager was an issue I dealt with for a long time. Luckily, the growth of SaaS companies has helped expand options for these types of things. I am constantly testing new software and tools, so I have put together a pretty decent list of options for managing bookmarks. I actually use two separate bookmarking tools: One for my personal bookmarks / images and one for sharing articles, links, etc. with my team. Raindrop For personal bookmarks, I use Raindrop.io  I like it because it is super easy to use and you have different options for viewing your saved links (listed text, image with headline, image without headline, etc.). My favorite part about it is how easy it is to save images. Once you install their Chrome Extensions, you can just right click on an image and save it to your Raindrop account. You can use it for free or pay $3 / mo for some extra features (can\u2019t remember exactly what they are). Here is a longer review of Raindrop Lasso My employees and I had been using Raindrop for our shared bookmarks until I came across Lasso a few weeks ago.  You can categorize your bookmarks into different folders or using tags. What I loved was the fact that users can comment on saved articles. This makes it super easy for us to share some thoughts on a saved topic or potential client. I think it is relatively new, but I haven\u2019t found any issues with it yet, and my team and I have already switched over to it. Additional info: Free for up to 5 users, Chrome Extension GGather I have only briefly tested out GGather, but it appears it has a ton of options as well.  GGather also has some different view mods and is another great tool for saving images. I have not used it for sharing / collaborating yet, but for personal use it was pretty awesome. Dropmark Dropmark is definitely an image-first bookmarking tool.  Its another one that is really good for teams and collaboration. Like a few of the others I mentioned, you can comment on links and images with Dropmark as well. Additional info: Chrome Extension, Mac desktop app. There is a free version with options for a paid plan ($4 / mo) and team plan ($5 / mo) A few others: Pocket - good for saving and reading laterWebjets.io \u2013 Pretty expansive, good for a lot of different thingsHush - Pretty cool extension for private bookmarksDiigoTobyHere is a longer list with the best chrome bookmark managers.

            "answer_text": "I'd been frustrated by the lack of a easy to use yet powerful bookmarking system myself, which is why I created iCrumz. It's a free, cloud-based bookmarking platform with no ads. There's nothing to download or install; you just go to iCrumz and setup a free account and you're off an running. And then you can login from any browser on any device and all your bookmarks will be there. There's no need to sync between browsers and devices or anything like that, since all your bookmarks are stored in the cloud. We didn't build it as a toolbar because we felt that most users wanted to use their entire screen to be able organize and access their bookmarks. Since it's free with no advertising you may be concerned about how we make money. We don't, and never will, share any of our users' info with advertisers or anyone else. We make money through affiliate relationships with companies like Amazon so when you click on a bookmark in iCrumz and buy something, they pay us a commission on your purchase. ",
