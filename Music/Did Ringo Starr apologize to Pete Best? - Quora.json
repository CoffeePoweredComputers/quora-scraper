            "answer_text": "Ringo doesn't owe Pete Best and apology. Ringo was a friend of the band who had filled in for Best before. He was well known and well liked by the other Beatles, but he wasn't angling to take Best\u2019s job. All Ringo did was accept the offer of a gig, probably in the knowledge that if Best hadn't already been sacked he soon would be, likely regardless of Ringo\u2019s answer. The other Beatles in contrast did conspire to replace Best with Ringo, and even had Brian Epstein go and break the news to him that he'd been fired rather than doing it themselves. When the first volume of the Beatles Anthology CDs was released in the mid-90s, Best\u2019s performance at the band's Decca records audition could be heard for the first time. The band (minus John for obvious reasons) offered Best a payment of several million pounds to have this performance released. As apologies go, it may have been somewhat belated, but it was well received. ",

            "answer_text": "For what? For taking his job? Ringo didn\u2019t fire Pete. Brian Epstein fired Pete. According to John, the band hated the way Pete played. But they were getting gigs. They always talked about finding a new drummer. And of course Ringo was at the top of the list. The problem the guys had with Ringo was, he was already playing in a more popular band. But Ringo loved the Beatles. So when he got the call from Brian, he was all in. Ringo had already sat in with the band a few times in Germany. He knew how they played. He said he always loved that front three of John, Paul and George. Pete also had a habit of wanting to sing. And from his drum kit. He wanted to stand out front and sing. This annoyed the band. Lennon said that when Martin told Brian he would use a session player on the recordings, that was the push the band needed to finally fire Pete. And it\u2019s true, Martin did use a session drummer on two songs. But when he heard Ringo play, well, Ringo played drums for the band for the next 8 years. I guess he passed the audition. ",
