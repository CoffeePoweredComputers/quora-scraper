            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a. I don\u2019t have any sources but I can go by some things I remember reading about Chopin and his technique. Chopin was largely self-taught and developed a technique that was unconventional for his time. When he was young and unknown, he had the chance to play for the famous pianist Friedrich Kalkbrenner, who was trained in the old style. Kalkbrenner said that Chopin\u2019s technique was very flawed, and offered to take him on as a pupil to \u201cfix\u201d him, but he would need to basically start from scratch. Chopin was planning to take Kalkbrenner up on the offer, but luckily his friend Felix Mendelssohn convinced him not to. When Chopin\u2019s etudes came out, many pianists complained that they were impossible to play. This is because they had been trained with old-fashioned pedagogy which emphasized finger action and keeping the hands straight. Chopin\u2019s etudes require modern techniques like rotation and arm weight, which were unknown to pianists at the time. Chopin must have figured them out on his own without really understanding the significance of what he was doing. As a frail and sickly person, Chopin did not like to play with a lot of volume or bombast and did not play in big concert halls like Liszt did. He preferred to play for a few people in an intimate setting. He was known to keep a straight tempo and advised his students against using much rubato. His performances of his own music probably sounded quite gentle and lacked the more exaggerated mannerisms that we tend to associate with it today. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it is known that he could play everything he composed. He made a lot of technically difficult pieces such as his etudes, ballades and preludes (some others are very tricky too) this alone shows he had great technique. He could also play both WTC books by Bach which some are also very technically demanding. All this shows that he was probably one of the best pianists of his era, just behind liszt and alkan. ",
