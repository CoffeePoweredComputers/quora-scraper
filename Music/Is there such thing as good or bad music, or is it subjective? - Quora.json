            "answer_text": "Sure, music can be objectively good or bad. That\u2019s why Music Theory exists. And I mean \u201cstudying harmony, structure, and all the elements\u201d theory, not \"I memorized a few chord progressions\u201d theory. There's a lot of craft that goes into writing music and some people are better than others at it. Conversely, many people range from mediocre to lousy. And then, a few are exceptionally better than everyone else. Those are the Mozarts and Beethovens- people who write so well that they endure for hundreds of years. Keep in mind that objectively good/bad doesn't always correspond to subjectively good/bad. In pop music especially, commercial success depends on many more factors than just how well the music is crafted. Is that bad? I don't necessarily think so, since that kind of music is made to entertain audiences. Where we run into problems discussing issues like this isn't in the perception of the music. Most of us can tell if something is really great or really awful. We can't communicate because we lack the mutual language to be able to discuss it. It's really the same issue that many specialties run in to. Take food, for instance. We all can confidently say that a Michelin-starred restaurant is better than a 24-hour truck stop diner, right? But how many of us can really explain why with more than \u201cit's just better because it is, duh\u201d? OK, that's an obvious one, a \u201creally good/really bad\u201d comparison. How does it change if we compare things that are between the extremes? Think about the differences between Oreo cookies and the store brand version. The Oreos are better, at least to me, but how exactly? And how well are we going to understand each other\u2019s interpretations? I think this lack of understanding in music leads people to throw their hands up and say it's all just subjective. It takes thoughtful discussion over many sessions to synthesize a mutual language to discuss things that aren't easily definable, like music or food. Most people aren't interested in taking that time, and would rather \"like what I like, just because\u201d and turn on the radio. In my industry, classical music, this is an enormous barrier for a lot of people trying to develop an interest in it. The perceived sophistication of the language can be very intimidating. People who feel intimidated usually going to play it off with \u201cThose musicians are just a bunch of snobs\u201d or \u201cWho likes that old, boring crap anyway.\u201d There's a lot of foreign language to try to pronounce, weird words that people haven't heard before, and words that should seem familiar but aren't used in ways that are (and, frankly, just enough people who ARE actually snobs to make newbies feel unwelcome). Really, it's mostly just a matter of learning to communicate within the sphere. ",

            "answer_text": "So I would say no, there is no such thing as good music and bad music. But then again, as a musician and producer myself, I would then say there is. Contradictory right? Let me explain! So music is considered good by the listener. So you might like classical, and I might like heavy metal, so if you listened to my music, you might think, \u201choly crap, why is this dude screaming in my ear and what is this noise?\u201d. It is all in the listeners preferences. So that is why there can be no such thing as bad music. The reason why I can say that there is, would be the way it is produced. Now, many people say that Justin Beiber was a horrible musician. I would beg to differ. Okay, not his old stuff. That was all crap. His newer album shows a lot of creativity and maturity, and even experimentation with his sounds. That is where bad music can come into play. Everyone today wants to be a rapper. I can walk down the streets of NYC and be handed about 5 mixtapes. Most of them suck. It takes patience, it takes good equipment, and it takes a good ear. You cannot and will not produce good music if you just throw a beat together and try and spit \u201cbars\u201d over it. The Beatles didn\u2019t just grab a mic and record their music on their iPhone (they didn\u2019t have them back then) or in Garage Band. They took time and effort to create the music that is still amazing today! Music is an art. Its a way that you can take your sounds and your emotions and paint a wonderful portrait that people can listen to. But in order to get a masterpiece, effort needs to be put in. This is bad music:  This is good music:  Hopefully you guys got passed the fact that I said Justin Beiber is a good musician, and enjoyed the post. ",
