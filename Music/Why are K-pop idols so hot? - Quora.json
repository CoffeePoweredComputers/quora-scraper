            "answer_text": "Some or if not most of the idols have gotten plastic surgery done to their faces. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s a bad thing but plastic surgery does make their faces look nicer. There are some idols who are naturally born pretty but that\u2019s just a rare few. Another reason would be the image that they strive to uphold. For boy groups that debut with a strong concept, most people would probably think that they are hot. I mean, when a boy group comes out strong and all with such strong lyrics and choreography, it\u2019s easy for people to think that they are hot. For those groups that have a cuter and softer image, it\u2019s a little harder for people to think that they are hot on the first impression. Another reason why you might think that they are hot would be your own perception of beauty. As people always say, \u201cbeauty lies in the eyes of the beholder\u201d. As such, what might be beautiful to me might not be beautiful to you. It\u2019s the same concept with which idols you think are hot. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2026 Is this an actual question??? *Sighs* In the past, K-pop actually looked for talented singers, regardless of appearance. However, as time went on, appearance became more of a priority. Why else do you think crazy diets became a trend, or double eyelids, or the dangerous v-chin operation, or having \u201cglass skin\u201d? Whenever you look at a newly debuted group, they all seem to fit the Korean beauty standard, because they were chosen for that reason. An attractive group that sings well will attract more fans than a less appealing group with the same singing ability, it\u2019s logic, it\u2019s a common business strategy. You can meet tons of singers in South Korea with beautiful voices, but their physical appearance won\u2019t be acceptable for the K-pop industry. As more and more time goes on however, I feel like the physical appearance of idols are being placed before singing ability. While many fans of a group can tell you who\u2019s who, many newcomers can\u2019t. As my mom (who lived in South Korea until her mid-twenties), once said \u201cI can\u2019t tell who\u2019s who anymore\u201d. She\u2019s fine with older groups, like BigBang, Shinhwa, Shinee, Super Junior, and Girls Generation, but new groups are impossible. Anyways, hope this helps! ",
