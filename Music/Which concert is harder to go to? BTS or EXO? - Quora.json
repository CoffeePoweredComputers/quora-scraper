            "answer_text": "I myself am not an EXO fan - though I do like their songs I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to get my hands on tickets - I have a colleague who is and keeps telling me like every second day how impossible it is to get tickets. And she is litereally willing to go anywhere in the world for a concert. I myself have been to a BTS concert in Macau last year, which happened to take place while I was travelling through Korea. I was quite surprised to find geting tickets was not as impossible as I figured. Especially since their Taiwan concerts sold out about 10 minutes after going on sale. After I had bought my tickets for Macau I checked the venue again a week or so later and you could still get tickets - not a lot but still single ones here and there. (and obviously not the best or the cheaptest categories either). So I guess it depends on location. While the Taiwan and Korea concerts felt like being sold out before tickets even went on sales I guess there are a few locations where you don\u2019t have to be the first in queue to get tickets. Or I was just lucky, seeing that their US concerts and Japan concerts sell out super fast as well. I also believe that the unpleasant thing called ticket scrapers make it additionally very hard for fans. Since they buy tickets in large bulks to sell them onwards for ridicolous outragous prices. But that is a problem I guess which applies to every big artist. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A - Well I don't have personal experience with this (of course I don't, will I ever have??), but if the question was about which tickets are more difficult to get and based on other people's stories, I have to agree with other answers - it's EXO. The fact is, so you don't have to be a fan to agree with this, that they hold that record for selling don't-know-how-many tickets in less than 0.5 sec, and other concerts always sell out in 2-3 minutes the most. The demand for BTS tickets is also crazy, so they don't need much more time to sell them either. Some of the answers explained it better, but let's say that in practice, it might depend on the city/country where the concert is being held (which also means the number of seats available and so on). And if this question was also about which fan behavior/atmosphere/overall experience (ahem, read: hysteria) would be more difficult to put up with\u2026well if you would ever be so blessed to get those tickets, everything else would matter less ;) ",
