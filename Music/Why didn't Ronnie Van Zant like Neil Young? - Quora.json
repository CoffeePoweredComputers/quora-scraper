            "answer_text": "Who says he didn't? Here's a photo of Ronnie. Can you tell who that is on his t-shirt? (Hint: it's Neil.)  Van Zant was a proud Southerner and a self-professed \u201chillbilly\u201d, but he was not a bigot, nor were his bandmates. So when he heard Neil Young's songs \u201cSouthern Man\u201d and \u201cAlabama\u201d, he judged them, rightly so, as condescending and presumptuous, painting all white Southerners as racists, and wrote \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d \u2014 mainly as a joke, according to him \u2014 in response (despite Skynyrd being from Florida, not Alabama). In Van Zant's own words: \u201cWe thought Neil was shooting all the ducks in order to kill one or two. We\u2019re Southern rebels, but more than that, we know the difference between right and wrong.\u201d \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d was meant to remind Neil Young that simply being white and from the South didn't make someone ignorant or bigoted. Young, for his part, loved the song, and himself admits that \u201cAlabama\u201d in particular \u201crichly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me with their great record. I don't like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue.\u201d So the real story is, Ronnie and the rest of Skynyrd were big fans of Young, Young was a big fan of Skynyrd, and Ronnie and Neil were actually friends. With \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d, Ronnie was just taking a lighthearted shot at Neil for taking what he saw as an unfair shot at the South. Neil Young & Lynyrd Skynyrd: The Friendliest of Feuds ",
