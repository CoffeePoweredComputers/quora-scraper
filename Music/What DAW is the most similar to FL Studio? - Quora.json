            "answer_text": "I would say Ableton Live is pretty similar to FL Studio. Once i had a project in FL Studio that was cmprised only of softare VST plugin channels . We wanted to record vocals and live instruments for the project, but we decided that we wanted to use Ableton Live due to it's advanced audio processing capabilities. It was very easy to export the project from FL Sudio and then open the same project in Ableton in order to finish the recording. We only had to export the project as a folder full of MIDI clips which corresponded with the clips in fruity. As I recall, we encountered no problems during the process. Ableton was able to pick up the track instrument names and clip names, etc from the files, and then all we had to do was reassign the correct software plugin for each track, and then we were ready to go.
