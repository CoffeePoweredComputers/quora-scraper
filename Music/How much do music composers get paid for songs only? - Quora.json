            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t a going rate for composing music. How much composers make all depends on their level of success and can range anywhere from nothing at all to billions. Update (because the question has been changed) How much do music composers get paid for songs only? There isn\u2019t a going rate for composing songs either. Obviously some songs are more successful than others. This is true even of the small minority of songs which are hits. The more plays on radio, TY and YouTube etc a song gets, the more income it will generate; the more legal download sales it achieves, the more income it will generate; the more sales of physical media (CDs, Vinyl, cassette etc.) it achieves, the more income it generates; the more times a song is performed live, the more income it can potentially generate etc. The more cover versions of a song that are made, the more income a song can generate. The more adverts and movies the song appears somewhere in, the more income a song can generate. Some songs even still generate some income from sales of sheet music. A song can potentially go on generating income for a great many years. If it was written after 1978 it should stay in copyright until 70 years after the death of the composer. If it was written before 1978 and after 1940 it\u2019s probably still in copyright. It could still be in copyright if it\u2019s even older than that. Anyway. Then someone has to collect all that income and that isn\u2019t something any songwriter can hope to do on their own. And no one is going to collect your royalties for free - obviously, because no one could afford to do that. Music Publishing isn\u2019t a charity. Royalty splits are not standard, they are negotiable and subject to contract. So, no one can tell you how much a music composer will get paid for a song because no one can accurately predict how much income a song will generate . Not unless it\u2019s a case where a songwriter composes a song and then sells off all their rights to it for a set fee; and that\u2019s not the sort of thing that goes on very much, if at all, these days. But I suppose it may possibly be the case in the future. Who knows? Sounds like a bad idea to me. All your music revenue sources (and how to collect the money) | DIY Musician Blog ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what type of composer and who the composer is. I suspect you are talking about composers who write orchestral compositions. So, let\u2019s take Danny Elfman as an example. He has built a reputation around composing certain type of sounds certain movies look for. As well, they gain name recognition and possible soundtrack sales. For this, Elfman will get quite a bit of money upfront and will be paid every time the movie is shown or any of the music gets played either on the radio or by someone else. Now, for the majority of orchestral composers, they actually have to depend upon government grants to hire union musicians to play their composition. This most likely will get performed, but the ticket sales will not cover the cost of the musicians and the hall they perform in. So, the composition actually loses money. Just think of all the music that wouldn't exist if it were not for us all pitching in. And think, some want to take that all away. Certain labels that specialize in new compositions may front the money for a talented composer to have their compositions recorded and released. Again, there\u2019s no money in this, but it can lead the composer to a job teaching composition. In a way, that\u2019s like getting paid for a composition. (This same thing happens with book authors as well). Occasionally, someone will hear the recording and pay to use part of the composition for any number of projects. Sometimes, again, for a film. This is a little bit of money, but not enough to live on, unless a certain piece or indy movie blows up. Then, this can lead to larger contracts for the composer. But this is very, very rare. ",
