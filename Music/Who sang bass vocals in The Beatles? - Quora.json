            "answer_text": "The Beatles didn\u2019t really have a bass singer. The following snippet from Walter Everett\u2019s The Beatles as Musicians displays their documented vocal ranges through 1963, at any rate:  From this, we can see that Lennon had the widest range by a whisker, but only if you include falsetto (which are the diamond-shaped noteheads to the right of the double line). Lennon\u2019s regular voice ranged from A4 down to C#2; McCartney\u2019s went from D5 down to Ab2, although he could hit a higher falsetto than Lennon; Harrison\u2019s, unsurprisingly, went from G4 down to B2. This is from the Google Books version of Everett\u2019s book; if there\u2019s a diagram showing Starkey\u2019s range, I would assume that it\u2019s somewhere within Harrison\u2019s range but barely wider than an octave. The band used to choose and write songs for him with his limited range in mind, but listen to how hard he had to strain to hit that final high G. If there were low parts to be sung in a song, Lennon would usually sing them: e.g. in their cover of the Coasters \u2018Young Blood\u2019, he would typically speak the line \u2018Look a-there\u2019 in a sly growl. But the characteristics of a bass voice are not ones that the Beatles show in their own singing: what I mean is, they didn\u2019t have a bass singer in the way that the Ink Spots had Hoppy Jones (\u2018If I didn't care, honey child, mo' than words can say, if I didn't care, baby, would I feel this way? Darlin', if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so much\u2026\u2019) In fact, one of their only examples of almost bass singing is on one of my favourite b-sides, \u2018You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)\u2019, when a smarmy Lennon welcomes the listener to \u2018Shaggers\u2019 and introduces vocalist \u2018Denis O\u2019Bell\u2019, and McCartney breaks into some spectacularly greasy crooning: Good evening You know my nay-eem, Look, look, look up my number You know my name, that\u2019s right Look up my number, You, you know, you know my name\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "None of the Beatles were true basses. George was a timid baritone/ tenor in the beginning with a limited range. John was a high baritone, and Paul is a natural tenor. Despite John and Paul both having large vocal ranges capable of singing bass all the way to tenor notes, it was usually George on bottom end, John in the middle, and Paul delivering the high harmonies. Most often, only John and Paul harmonized, but there are plenty of 3 part harmonies including Twist and shout, This boy, because, Girl, Golden slumbers (which actually is 4 part, Ringo sings too) etc Special note: Paul sometimes did bass overdubs on his own songs. If you listen carefully to \u201cI Will\u201d, the bass is actually Paul\u2019s own voice. ",
