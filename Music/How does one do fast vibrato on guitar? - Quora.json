            "answer_text": "If one wants to attain a good vibrato, one must first understand what is happening when you vibrato.   What is actually happening to the pitch of the string when you use vibrato is that you are lengthening and shortening the length of the guitar string within the framework of the fret in rapid succession.  Oftentimes you will see players initiating their vibrato by bending the strings upwards and downwards - this is incorrect as you are actually changing the pitch.  One exercise to illustrate would be to do the following: Play a note, preferably higher up on the the fretboard.  Play the note smack in the middle between the two frets and let it ring out until silence.  Now, within the same fret, play the note as close to the higher fret as possible.  You will notice that the pitch is slightly changed to being a bit sharper than the note that was previously played.  The lateral movement of the finger placement needs to change in order for you to stay within pitch.  A good vibrato never moves the strings up and down - it should only be from side to side.   However, this does not mean that you should be sliding your finger within a fret to attain that vibrato, but you should be placing your finger with precision at first and then using that placement as a pivot where you are rolling the finger back and forth from that pivot to the higher pitch within the same fret: ref: Violin Vibrato: SLOW MOTION: Dos and Don'ts (CC: Portuguese, Spanish, Eng, Chinese)  - Watch from linked location.   Also from the same video: please note what she says about wrists...  This applies to the guitar.  After getting the basics of the vibrato down, you should practice the vibrato slowly and relaxed.  If you can get a vibrato to sound good slowly - similar to how a violinist would play it - then speeding it up is a matter of practice.  Let go of that death grip you have on the guitar and in your shoulders and wrists.  The actual movement does not come from the wrist, but the rolling of the finger that is initiated by the entire arm.   As a side note, I observe that even in the most seasoned players that the vibrato is actually a pitch bend on the string rather a proper vibrato.  There is a difference, and the effects are uniquely different to the ears of the player.   edit: Also as another aside - get good at playing a clean note first - as a beginner your vibrato comes off as showboating of poor technique to seasoned players.

            "answer_text": "I know, everyone has a different style of vibrato, but here is the thing. Vibrato should be well controlled and carefully placed. Once you master it, you should be able to control speed and how wide the vibrato is. A good vibrato also goes hand in hand with a good bending technique It is important on who to follow, not many guitarists do that properly, even the pro. Because of that, don\u2019t rely on teachers to do that. I don\u2019t recommend someone like BB king for your reference about vibrato, because that is a hell of a bad vibrato, he has what I call a nervous vibrato. I recommend someone like yngwie, paul gilbert, bruce bouillet, SRV, doug rappoport, joe satriani, guthrie govan or some other blues player as a reference Vibrato should be done by WRIST, not fingers, this is important. It is easier to play with fingers, because of that many young players fall into that trap. It will give you problems in the future, such as inconsistent vibrato and pitch problems. Personally, I recommend switching to thumbs over fretboard when playing vibrato You can practice it with a metronome, but I personally don't do that. The most important thing is: practice slowly, then try to play faster once you have good feeling on the slow side. Here it is, seems to be a good tutorial  ",
