            "answer_text": "Answered from my personal experience as a mature aged student with a 120 bass piano accordion and very limited prior keyboard experience:-Your prior skills, accordion type, musical preferences, and availability of a teacher are just a few of many factors. I am in an area where there are no accordion teachers within a 1 hour drive from home so I had limited choice. In some time zones it is possible to have lessons over the internet; I have not tried this.Consequently, I am learning from books, internet & DVDs and so far, 18 months along the path it is working out quite well. I practice more or less every day. One must be quite motivated and have, or develop,  a passion for the instrument.Apart from the motivation and various information sources, I get a lot of benefit from three specific aspects; 1) I find it is helpful to have your accordion readily accessible, not in its case but on a bench with a dust cover over it. Getting going takes 30 seconds and the convenience is really worth it; 2) having a separate keyboard or piano is useful for getting the right hand sorted by figuring out your fingering, learning a piece, and speeding up the playing.3) specific left hand training books/techniques and the Stradella chart help build the mental bass button map that is required to quickly find any particular key/chord.4) practice, practice, practice; but also think a bit about how to learn and how to allocate your time; e.g. 1/3 to basic drills; 1/3 to new things; 1/3 to tunes in your repertoire. Play as often as possible for anyone who is willing to put up with your playing... I purchased a really old but inexpensive instrument to see if I could make a run at it before buying a second much better, only 10 year old professional instrument, 6 months later. A good box is much easier to play than a tired out one that needs refurbishing. ",

            "answer_text": "If you already know a little piano or organ or synthesizer, the keys are just the same -- only a little smaller!   Practice some songs you know to get your fingers accustomed to the size. Learn how to work the bellows until you don't have to think about them consciously.  Play either chords or melody, trying to make a smooth, continuous sound that doesn't waver in intensity. The trick is getting the chords, the melody and the bellows all working together.  That's why I suggest spending a lot of time working on the thing that is newest and strangest to you -- keeping those things going so it doesn't sound like a cow died in the room, as it did the only time I tried playing accordion.
