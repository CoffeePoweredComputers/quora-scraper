            "answer_text": "I think a lot of people are overreacting to your question, because they think you're going to join the Army at 13. I think you know that it's impossible to do because the Army not only has age restrictions, but you have to have a diploma or equivalent, which you will not have at age 13. Instead of overreacting, I am going to encourage you to talk to a recruiter and know what jobs you can do in the Army, and once you graduate from high school, you can sign up and be in the pipeline to start that career. In fact, your school counselor can help you take classes that will benefit you and also pique your interest in what kind of job you might want in the Army. I was in the Navy active duty for 20 years, in the communications field which is now IT. I was also assigned to fire teams at every duty station, including three as Fire Marshall. I volunteered at Armed Forces Radio for fun as well, and I still do volunteer broadcasting as a civilian now. The most important thing you learn in the military is how to work with other people, and that helping the team accomplish goals is usually more important than self accomplishment. In high school, I was president of my school's chess team, and I didn't fit in with the jocks despite being in pretty good shape. Joining the service meant I could also excel as a basketball and football player, and I played like I wanted to show those school-level coaches and super stars what they all overlooked. I loved hitting game-changing 3-pointers on the command basketball team and making big plays on the football team. ",

            "answer_text": "Fine\u2026 but you can't as you are not of legal age to enter into a binding contract when enlisting\u2026 so, at 13\u2026 I assure you wouldn't last a week in Army boot camp, and an ex-marine, myself\u2026 surely not a day or two in Corp boot. But. When of legal age, I would give it thought as it can be a great experience and the education and other benefits during and after service rewarding and valuable. ",
