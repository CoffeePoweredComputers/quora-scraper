The music not only fit the movie perfectly, but to this day I still find it to be an amazing background listening soundtrack as well as engaging enough to make you acknowledge the sounds. When I can\u2019t access the mood of a room or just want a little something to enhance game night without the drama of asking what people want to listen to, worrying about offending someone, or having to deal with a not so great song coming up on shuffle \u2014 yep, I put on The Replacement Killers soundtrack.
