            "answer_text": "I will respectfully disagree with the previous posters. Let us set aside the various difficulties in qualifying and determining skill, and instead focus on his technical and credentials ability.  Lil Wayne's technicals and credentials are impressive.In terms of his credentials two points stand out: the young age at which he debuted and his heroic amounts of guest verses. At age 16, he had already recorded and released a hit album with his group the Hot Boyz. It is not easy to release a hit record, and to successfully do so at such a young age shows considerable prowess. Therefore, when he says in the song \"Stuntin' Like My Daddy\": When I was 16 I bought my first Mercedes Benz / I musta fucked a thousand bitches and they girl friends, he may not be exaggerating by much. After all, 1000 bitches in one year is ~2.7 a day which is not impossible. If his claim at the time of writing is only that he has copulated with 1k bitches since the time of his first Benz purchase, his rate would be a still impressive 125 a year or roughly one every three days. Lil Wayne has produced prolific amounts of material, and has produced very successful material. Estimates vary, but my 99% confidence interval for the number of songs Lil Wayne has participated in is [200,50000]. My guess for the actual number is around 3000. He has volumes and volumes of unreleased work. He has had 100+ songs on the Billboard Top 100, surpassing Elvis Presley in 2012 for most songs on the chart by a male artist. The Carter III, which I will address later on, sold approximately 3.6mm copies.  Moving on to his technical ability, let us consider what is (in my opinion) his zenith, the wildly successful song \"A Milli\" from the album Tha Carter III. I love the way he is able to continue to string together the same few sounds in different ways to continue to rhyme wayyyyy past the point where you think it would stop. For example, in the second half of the second verse he repeatedly employs the word \"bitch\" and the sound \"i\": Call me what you want, bitch, call me on my Sidekick\nNever answer when it's private, damn I hate a shy bitchDon't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch\nAnd she ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My BitchYeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask\nFor the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitchIt ain't trickin' if you got itBut you like a bitch with no ass: you ain't got shitMotherfucka I'm ill, not sick and I'm okay, but my watch sickYeah, my drop sick, yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick, I'm it Basically he is saying: \"girl, you call me on my Motorola Sidekick. I hate shy women but I once performed such spectacular oral sex on a shy woman she subsequently changed her name to \"My Bitch,\" and began a life of prostitution under me. Then you had sex with a girl. Since she was my girl she asked to be paid afterwards, cuz you aren't a baller like me who can have sex for free with anyone (it ain't trickin if ya got it). Actually, come to think of it you're more similar to a girl without an ass who, due to this lack of a posterior, both cannot defecate and has no tangible assets to me as a prostitute. I am so cool, I have a cool watch, I have a cool beat, I have a cool gun, I have thick hair, and I'm IT.\" Notice that \"i\" sound: my sidekick, private, shy bitch, shy bitch, shy bitch, shy, My Bitch, my bitch. Notice the repetition of the word bitch and the hilarious little story he tells, especially the twist of \"dont you hate a shy bitch? yeah I ate a shy bitch.\" Also the double entendre of \"you aint got shit,\" if you have no butt critical components of your gastrointestinal tract are missing and you should probably see a doctor, but also bitches with no ass don't have many.... assets to a pimp.  The overall theme of this song seems to be that Lil Wayne is a cool guy, while you the listener are forever relegated to trying to tear him down on internet chat rooms and question and answer sites. Lil Wayne don't care. When Lil Wayne dropped \"A Milli\" and said \"I'm it,\" it was amazing because it was a credible threat, not just talk; he meant it, he was the hottest rapper in the game, he said it and the onus on you was to disprove him since him and that beat had just proved it to you. But one must finally run up against the biggest barrier in the endless debate over rappers skills: the most (technically / lyrically / rhythmically / insert your metric) skilled rappers aren't always the most successful. Let us remember Jay-Z's quip from \"Moment of Clarity\": If skills sold truth be told / I'd probably be, lyrically, Talib Kwali / Truthfully I'd like to rhyme like Common Sense, / But I did 5mil, I ain't been rhymin like Common since.  What makes Lil Wayne great, and what I see as making him skilled, is that he combines the lyrical capabilities with pure confidence (telling the most openly hostile and competitive genre out there that you are \"it\") and showmanship which have allowed him to be tremendously successful. We can differ on our definitions of \"skill\" and we may end up with different conclusions about who has it, but one simply cannot ignore that at the moment when Lil Wayne proclaimed he was \"it,\" it was kind of hard to deny that he wasn't.
