            "answer_text": "Standing makes a HUGE difference when singing. Here's why.  A major part of singing is physical. You are the instrument. As such, you need to have your body in alignment to produce a beautiful sound.  Breath control alone is critical for good singing - it determines whether you're on pitch, your tone and color, how you phrase the notes, how you sustain long notes, how you prepare for the next phrase... The list goes on.  When I sing, I try to imagine myself being held up by a marionette's strings. It keeps my head up, and the back of my throat open, which keeps the front part of my instrument open and resonant and lets the air flow. The puppet strings imagery also keeps my spine straight, my rib cage up and my diaphragm free, so I can breathe deeply and support the sound I'm generating with my whole body. Now imagine trying to do all that while sitting down.  Your spine changes.  Your diaphragm is more compressed, making it harder to take deeper, supporting breaths.  It's harder to keep a straight air flow for your instrument, so your tone may waver, you may need to sneak more breaths in, you may have to break up phrases creatively. Singing while sitting down, or striding across an opera stage, or otherwise in a non-choral position is still possible, of course, and many professionals do it quite well.  But they're making an exception -- they've already perfected making a beautiful tone from a singing stance that they've learned ways to cheat on that stance and still produce that glorious sound.  In choral pieces we sometimes sing while seated, but it's almost exclusively for movements where we are in the background, singing incidental phrases to support a soloist.  Even then, singing quietly takes MORE breath than singing loudly because of the control involved. For lip syncing, I think most singers sing along anyways rather than just move their mouths without breath and pretend to sing.  That's because you can tell the difference -- in someone's face, and lips, and throat, and their whole body being committed to making the sound by pulling off the top of a pool of breath.  It's precisely because it's harder to sing while moving around that they probably do the dubbing, so there's a consistency of sound that's not lost every time they bend over, do a dance step, or otherwise interfere with themselves as an instrument.
