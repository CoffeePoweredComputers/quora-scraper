            "answer_text": "In my opinion it\u2019s more likely that you just don\u2019t rememebr the trauma. And I don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a hidden memory of abuse (people told me for years my parents must have abused me so terrible I blocked it out - and in my case that was not true. It may be for some people of course. But I have spent time wondering why I have struggled and presented as someone traumatised and after working with some very young foster children I came to think likely my experiences as a very young baby (when I was in an incubator and seperated from my mother for several weeks ) May have played a part , as well as my mother\u2019s anxiety disorder (I never knew about until I was much older ) , my father tells me she was beside herself worrying about me as an infant and that I wouldn\u2019t feed etc. I didn\u2019t ever think those experiences mattered. But I have worked with foster children some from horrible abuse removed at age ten or older and some removed on day three or four of life and adopted by loving families , and yet they still present as children who have endured abuse or trauma. I really came to believe that pre Natal and very early experiences can make a difference to development , and something traumatic to a small infant isn\u2019t something I was ever consciously aware of or even knew about, but I do believe it perhaps contributed to my problems. I can\u2019t speak for you of coirse or anyone else , but it may be something that happened at a crucial development stage and when you were quite young. I have another memory around age five of being in a performance on stage with a group of schools in a choir. At the end we were taken to a seemingly huge room with what felt like millions of kids and parents came in to fetch their children. It felt like hours to me and I remember thinking I couldn\u2019t breathe , and that I would never be united with my parents. For years after I remember being haunted by the fact I had either died that night and stopped breathing and I was actually dead and none of my life had happened , or I had become ill and was on a coma dreaming all that happened. At one point years later I mentioned to my parents. They have zero memory of the event or that it took a long time to pick me up or ever knowing it bothered me. I\u2019m sure there were similar things happened as a younger child I can\u2019t recall and maybe that\u2019s led to my fear of abandonment. Nothing terrible happened to me. But for a five year old it was terrifying to feel I was lost in a crown of kids and would never find my parents. I\u2019m sure teachers were there but I recall vividly being lost in a sea of kids and sure no one knew I was there. I was a weird kid I guess and perhaps there\u2019s some genetic or environmental component of my mothers anxiety that I picked up. Tho I had zero knowledge of her problems til very recently. I was ashamed to tell abojt my anxiety because I felt my parents so Normal and would never understand. I know many people who have endured severe trauma and my life doesn\u2019t compare at all. Yet doctors and psychologists have often assumed something worse happened to me because I presented as someone who endured trauma. So all I could come up with was some kind of thing that may have been minor but happened at a younger age and affected my development. I guess thinking about it being very sick as an infant and isolated in a hospital is traumatic. Even though as an infant I didn\u2019t understand it. anyways I wish you best for getting help and understanding yourself , take care ",

            "answer_text": "Emotional trauma can be as traumatic to people as physical trauma. An example of it is in a relationship, where your SO emotionally holds you hostage with a fear of leaving the relationship. Saying things that if you don\u2019t do this or that, they\u2019re out of the relationship. They know what upsets you and play with your emotions for you to obey them. Leaves no bruises or calls to the cops, but the mental scars it leaves, you\u2019ll have a hard time finding relationships later due to distrust and fears. Parents can be similar. They can be emotionally withholding if you don\u2019t do what they prefer. That coldest shoulder, \u201cYou do what you feel\u201d response. It can eat people to the bone, as for anyone a child wants approval from is their own parents. There\u2019s a lot of walking wounded in the world that\u2019s simply told to \u201cchin up\u201d. But chinning up is never enough. They maladapted, instead. They got meaner, harder and probably taking their pain out on alcohol and drugs, too. Let alone on others. Why you need to resolve those issues. So you don\u2019t fall into the trappings that keeps people in Ice Age tar pits of despair.  ",
