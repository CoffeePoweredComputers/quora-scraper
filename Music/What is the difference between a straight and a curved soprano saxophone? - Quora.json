            "answer_text": "There is very little difference other than the look of the two. Straight sopranos are more common, and it is sometimes said they suffer from fewer tuning inconsistencies, though that comes down to design and workmanship rather than straight vs curved. Some people believe there are tonal differences, though the main difference might be how the player hears the sound, as one points directly away from the player, and the curved will be more like a traditiobal saxophone. Ultimately it comes down to what feels and sounds comfortable to you. Yanagisawa makes excellent curved and straight sopranos. And I believe P Mauriat has a curved option available ",

            "answer_text": "Your question asks about a curved soprano which in fact is shaped the same as an alto, whereas your explanation is talking about the neck only. I don't have any definitive answer on this. I suspect the intonation is partly in your mind. You are expecting the sax to behave a certain way and so it does (or your embouchure does). Invest in an electronic tuner. Ultimately you can choose to use whichever neck you are most comfortable with. Hope this helps... ",
