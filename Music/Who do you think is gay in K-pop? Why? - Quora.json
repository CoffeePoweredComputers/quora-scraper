            "answer_text": "Update: I have decided that I think Kim Lip may be straight so I\u2019ll remove her from my list. After receiving some info on Miyeon from (G)-IDLE, I\u2019ve decided to add her to my list. Update #2: I have found some more info about Sehun that alludes to him being gay which I will add to this post. Update #3: I originally thought that all of GOT7 were straight but I have changed my mind on a couple members so I will be adding those members to my list. Update: I have changed my opinion on a certain EXO member and I will be adding that member to my list. Disclaimer: These are just my assumptions. If you disagree with them, that\u2019s fine. But remember that just because an idol doesn\u2019t say they\u2019re lgbt or even denies they\u2019re lgbt, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not LGBT. There are hundreds of kpop idols so of course they\u2019re are lgbt ones. However, if they were to come out, they could risk losing their careers which is why a lot of them don\u2019t come out to the public. Everything I\u2019m using to support my opinions can be searched up online. So use google if you want proof for what I\u2019m saying. I will be listing which idols I think are lgbt and why I think so. I\u2019m going to start with the members of Boy Groups I think are LGBT: 2 am Jo Kwon- Gay. Is there anyone who disagrees with me on this? Jo Kwon is obviously uninterested in women. There\u2019s a video of him kissing a woman in which he looks disgusted. I don\u2019t think he dislikes women. He\u2019s just not attracted to them. Whenever I see pics or videos of him with women, he looks like the gay best friend. He has a tattoo saying \u201cBorn this way\u201d. What straight guy gets that tattoo? He posted a pic on Instagram of him holding a Troye Sivan album and kissing it. Now onto how Jo Kwon has addressed the rumors about him being gay. He hasn\u2019t exactly denied them. In fact, the way he addresses them points to the likelihood of him being gay. Here are some ways he\u2019s addressed the rumors: He said he\u2019s \u201caware of those rumors, but I don't care at all. That's who I am\u201d\u201cI was born this way and I'm doing my best with what I'm given.\u201dI mean come on. He didn\u2019t even say he\u2019s not gay. This all sounds like he\u2019s gay. Astro MJ- Gay. He seems pretty into men but not women. Sanha- Gay. Like MJ, he also shows no interest in women. Ateez Yunho- Gay. He seems into men but not women. When he met one of the TVXQ members, it seemed like he got super flustered like he had crush on him. San- Gay. He also seems into men but not women. I\u2019m also going to talk about his interest in Troye Sivan. Troye has a huge LGBT fan base and many LGBT people, especially gay men, resonate with his songs which is why they like him. However, I don\u2019t believe that just because a man likes Troye\u2019s music, he\u2019s gay. Seonghwa and Jungkook like Troye\u2019s music and I believe both Seongwha and Jungkook are straight. However, I think it\u2019s different with San. His favorite song is \u201cHeaven\u201d by Troye. \u201cHeaven\u201d is about accepting yourself and not changing yourself for society. For a song like this to be San\u2019s favorite song, that\u2019s telling. Mingi- Gay. He literally said his ideal type is an actor named Nam Joohyuk. Straight men don\u2019t say their ideal type is a male actor. B.A.P. Yongguk- Gay. I know he contributes to writing a song in which one of the topics is LGBT relationships. When Himchan was talking about his techniques he uses to attract women. Yongguk asked whether they work on men too. That\u2019s just not something a straight guy would ask. Block B Zico- Bisexual and possibly non-binary. Another member says that \u201cZico\u2019s sexual taste is really unusual\u201d and that he \u201ckind of likes men as well\u201d. Zico doesn\u2019t react to this statement. I assume Zico has told his members he\u2019s bisexual. He also said if he were to become genderless, that would be fine. I don\u2019t fully understand non-binary identities, I\u2019ll admit, but people should identify as whatever gender they feel comfortable as. Taeil- Gay. He literally said he doesn\u2019t like girls but doesn\u2019t dislike them either. He says that girls are average. BTS: Jimin- Gay. He tweeted 5 years ago \u201cIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day. Only look if you\u2019re a fanboy. Don\u2019t look if you\u2019re a fan girl\u201d. And his crush on Tony from American Hustle Life? That was super obvious. It\u2019s not even the norm in Korean culture to hug anyone that isn\u2019t a family or friend. He didn\u2019t know Tony that well and was totally hugging him and all over him. I don\u2019t believe anything happened between Jimin and Tony because Tony seems straight. Jimin also flirted with a couple of male interviewers in America and he\u2019s totally flirted with Wonho. He\u2019s totally more into men than women. He\u2019s friendly with them, but it doesn\u2019t seem to get more than friendly. Yeah he\u2019s been flirty with fans at fansigns, but I think he knows it\u2019s part of his job. Idols have flirted with fans at fan-signs as part of their job. Gay men can put on an act and it\u2019s clear Jimin can do a good job at it flirting with fans. V- bisexual. I thought he was straight until he said that \u201cCall me By Your Name\u201d is his favorite movie. That\u2019s not something a straight guy says. V has also shown interest in women which is why I believe him to be bisexual. Suga- bisexual. He literally said in an interview that his dating preferences aren\u2019t limited to the opposite gender so he basically came out as bi. Also one of his lines in Cypher pt 3 J-hope- Bisexual. Honestly, he was hard to read but I decided he was bisexual. In an old video, Jimin said J-hope really likes men and J-hope didn\u2019t deny it. Also J-hope\u2019s relationship with Jimin is interesting. They\u2019re pretty affectionate but they may also just be friends. But if any two BTS members are dating, it\u2019s Jimin and J-hope. But J-hope also wrote part of the lyrics for \u201cWar of Hormone\u201d and looking at the lyrics, I just don\u2019t see how a gay man would write something like that. Plus he seems to show interest in women. CIX Yonghee- Gay. He just doesn\u2019t seem into women but he\u2019s definitely into men. D.I.P. Seongho and Yubon- Gay and are/were in a relationship. They said they were in a relationship on Facebook. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re still together though. Hyeonseong- bisexual. He said he liked both men and women on Facebook. EXO Chanyeol- Gay. So apparently I\u2019ve heard his mannerisms are more feminine but that\u2019s not why I think he\u2019s gay. I think he\u2019s gay because he posted on his social media asking why he falls in love with anime characters and saying \u201cWhy are those anime characters always male\u201d? This isn\u2019t something a straight guy says. Chanyeol is clearly gay and this is probably his way of indirectly coming out. Baekhyun- bisexual. He just gives off that vibe. He shows interest in both genders. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s promiscuous and/or polyamorous (nothing wrong with those things btw). Also I do believe Baekyun had something going on with Sehun whether it was completely sexual or romantic. Baekhyun and Sehun filmed a drama where they were fake making out I believe and Baekhyun said in an interview that the drama shows what he and Sehun do in their real life. He seemed totally serious saying that and not joking at all. Also he said Sehun has a big dick. They\u2019ve definitely had sex. Sehun- Gay. He literally said he liked men at a concert. He doesn\u2019t seem interested in women. Baekhyun even said he\u2019s not into girls. And I already explained what I think went on with him and Baekhyun. Sehun also starred in the Netflix variety show Busted and there was this scene where Sehun admited that he used his handsome face to swindle people, to this one of the guests asked him if he used his looks to swindle women out of money and Sehun replied with ''not women''. Tao- Gay. He just doesn\u2019t seem into women but seems into men. Kai- bisexual. There\u2019s a video of EXO performing in concert and D.O. is singing. It looks like Kai is staring at him. There\u2019s a fan who yells \u201cJongin (Kai\u2019s real name), he\u2019s going to melt!\u201d Some fans scream after that and laugh. Kai doesn\u2019t laugh. He literally turned his head away from D.O. My guess is that he may try not to make his attraction to men noticeable but that doesn\u2019t always work. GOT7 Bambam- Gay. Now, at first, I thought Bambam was straight. I didn\u2019t want to generalize him simple because he has feminine mannerisms. I also assumed that he just liked skinship and he had to act like that towards the members for his job. While I do believe that kpop companies make these idols do fanservice, I do believe that Bambam is gay because now I noticed that he doesn\u2019t seem into women and there\u2019s this video of him dancing during a concert where he\u2019s literally putting his hand to his mouth imitating giving a blowjob. That\u2019s just not something straight men do. Here\u2019s the link to the video (go to 0:20) to find the video of Bambam:  There is no heterosexual explanation for that. And no, I don\u2019t believe JYP told Bambam to do this. Two of the other members are sitting to the right of Bambam. One of them is JB but I can\u2019t tell who the other one is cause the vid is blurry. The other member laughs after Bambam imitates giving a blowjob while JB at first looks surprised and then laughs. Jackson- Bisexual. He may have a female preference. He honestly seems into both men and women and seems too comfortable doing gay fanservice stuff for a straight guy. IMFACT Ungjae- bisexual. He said his ideal type was a sexy guy. One of the other member\u2019s says that Ungjae\u2019s ideal type, who is a Korean male actor, is in a certain k-drama. When the members are sitting together in a V-live, one of them mentions that Ungjae\u2019s sexual preference keeps changing. Ungjae says that he\u2019s been single for awhile so maybe it can change. Jian- Gay. During a v-live, Ungjae says that Jian likes guys when Jian said his ideal type was a responsible girl. Jian said no and Ungjae said \u201cYou said you liked guys yesterday!\u201d MBLAQ Lee Joon- Bisexual. He literally said in an interview that he had gfs and bfs. Monsta X Minhyuk- Gay. He doesn\u2019t show any interest towards women but totally shows interest in men. He seems to enjoy doing affectionate fan service with his members which definitely isn\u2019t straight. Lots of kpop idols feel uncomfortable during fan service like this as you can tell. However, it\u2019s totally the opposite with Minhyuk. Wonho- bisexual. He literally said that gender doesn\u2019t matter to him in relationships so he came out as bisexual. He also dated a trans guy before he medically transitioned. Some people may hate that I\u2019m going to say this but I\u2019ll say it: Most gay cis men don\u2019t want to date trans men that haven\u2019t medically transitioned at all. Straight men aren\u2019t going to date trans men at any stage of their transition cause they\u2019re men. However, this isn\u2019t usually a problem for bisexual people. I know Wonho\u2019s former label said that he dated the trans guy to protect him but I think they said that to cover up Wonho\u2019s sexuality. NCT Taeyong- Gay. He literally said in an interview that he\u2019s not interested in women. That\u2019s basically coming out. He\u2019s gotten flustered by men multiple times. I know there was the scandal involving him being homophobic in his school days. I honestly think he had a lot of internalized homophobia but is more comfortable with his sexuality nowadays. I know he\u2019s related to Hong Suk Chung who is one of the few openly gay celebs in Korea and they didn\u2019t find out they were related or met until 2018. Hong Suk Chung could\u2019ve helped Taeyong become comfortable with his sexuality. Taeil- Bisexual. I\u2019m pretty sure he said he\u2019s fine dating a guy or girl. Yuta- Bisexual. He seems like he\u2019s into both men and women. Ten- Gay. He\u2019s obviously into men and not women. I know there was an interview with Ten\u2019s high school teacher and she said he wasn\u2019t into girls at school. Now, I know Thailand is more progressive on LGBT rights than Korea so maybe his teacher thought that would be ok to say? But Ten looked a bit surprised and nervous when she said that like he was concerned she was going to out him. Now onto his reaction to Hyunseung\u2019s and Stephanie\u2019s \u201cHit the Stage\u201d. If you haven\u2019t watched it, I suggest you should. The way he reacted to it definitely isn\u2019t how a straight man would react to it. Some people may say \u201cWell he didn\u2019t want to make himself look bad and ogle her on camera\u201d. Nah. He was pretty annoyed by the dance. The way he looked away from Stephanie basically screamed \u201cOMG I can\u2019t even\u201d. Jaehyun- Gay. He seems to show interest in men but not women. And when Wonho complimented him, he got extremely flustered. Not something that would happen to a straight guy. When Johnny (who I believe is straight) got complimented by Wonho, he didn\u2019t react in a way that would make people question his sexuality. Nu\u2019est Ren- Gay. I am not saying this because he looks very feminine. The other members seem to protect him from questions about his ideal type. Now, why would they do this if Ren wasn\u2019t gay? Also he has a tattoo of the lyrics \u201cwe are all born superstars\u201d from Lady Gaga\u2019s song \u201cBorn This Way\u201d. This just isn\u2019t a tattoo a straight man would get. Romeo Kangmin- Gay. This guy basically came out in an interview even though Korean media isn\u2019t believing it. He said his ideal type is a cute and handsome man like him. It\u2019s not a slip of the tongue because he wrote his answer down beforehand. Seventeen S. Coups.- Bisexual. He basically admitted he was bisexual in a song and I\u2019ll get into my opinions on his relationship with Woozi when I talk about Woozi. Jun- Gay. He seems more into men than women and when I got into seventeen, Jun was the one that gave me the most gay vibes. Woozi- Bisexual. Woozi doesn\u2019t seem to care about gender. Also there\u2019s definitely something going on between Woozi and S. Coups. There are videos of them predebut of S. Coups holding Woozi and kissing him on the cheek but not in a way where they\u2019re supposed to be doing fanservice. They seemed to have toned it down since debut probably due to not wanting to deal with assumptions and fans fetishizing their relationship. But Woozi doesn\u2019t seem to like affection from anyone unless it\u2019s S. Coups. That\u2019s telling. The8- Bisexual. When asked his ideal type by Hoshi, he responded with \u201cboy or girl\u201d? He basically indirectly came out as bisexual. Shinee Key- Gay. . He just doesn\u2019t show interest in women. Jonghyun (R.I.P.)- Bisexual. He seemed into both men and women. Stray kids Felix- bisexual. It\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019s into both men and women. At a fansign (and there\u2019s a recording to prove this and it\u2019s in English). A girl asked him what his ideal type was and he responded with \u201cBoy or girl?\u201d. She said both. He said his ideal type for a guy was someone who is dark and mysterious like Changbin. I have my opinions on whether Felix and Changbin had something going on and I\u2019ll get onto them when I talk about Changbin. Changbin- gay. He doesn\u2019t show interest in girls and I think it\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019s into men. I\u2019m not one to ship idols together but I do believe Felix and Changbin have or had something going on. Just the way they would look at each other and act around each other seemed more than friendly. I know that idols do gay fan service but this seemed more than that. Also Felix called Changbin cute in an American interview (America isn\u2019t big on fan service like Korea). Also Felix describing his ideal male type as basically Changbin? They either dated or are dating. It does seem like they toned it down a bit though. A few reasons could explain this: Changbin and Felix broke up.Changbin and Felix don\u2019t want people assuming things about their relationship.Changbin and Felix are sick of fans fetishizing their relationship.Super Junior Heechul- Bisexual with male preference. I initially thought Heechul was fully gay. He never even denied the rumors about him being gay. But now that he\u2019s dating Momo from Twice, I feel that he\u2019s bisexual with a male preference. There are bisexual people who think they\u2019re fully gay at first but then become romantically attracted to someone of the opposite gender. I think this happened in Heechul\u2019s case. There are also bisexual people who think they\u2019re fully straight but then become romantically attracted to someone of the same gender. Shindong- Bisexual. He said something about wanting the person that he dates to be pretty or handsome. I don\u2019t think he was referring to women when he said handsome. Eunhyuk- Bisexual. He shows interest in men and women. Siwon- Gay. Ok I know he\u2019s tweeted and said homophobic things. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not gay. I believe he is (or was) repressing his sexuality because he believes being lgbt is wrong. He\u2019s has way too much fun with gay fan service for him to be straight. There are plenty of idols who are clearly uncomfortable with gay fanservice but Siwon isn\u2019t. I hope he realizes (if he hasn\u2019t already) that there\u2019s nothing wrong with being LGBT and accepts his sexuality. If I\u2019m wrong and he\u2019s straight, I also hope he realizes there\u2019s nothing wrong with being LGBT (if he hasn\u2019t already). ZhouMi- Gay. He seems really into men but not into women. He only seems to like women as friends. Kibum- Bisexual. He seems to be into both genders. Also the letter he wrote describing Donghae definitely isn\u2019t very straight. The Boyz Kevin- Gay. He shows no attraction to women but he seems into men. TVXQ Junsu- Gay. While he has said that he\u2019s not gay, there are many factors to indicate that he is gay. He said that he feels good when people say he\u2019s gay. Even straight men with no fragile masculinity don\u2019t like people assuming they\u2019re gay. He played a role in a musical where he had to kiss a guy. No, this doesn\u2019t make him gay. There are straight men who have played gay male characters. I\u2019m getting to what does indicate that he\u2019s gay and how it relates to this musical. Junsu admitted that he wanted to kiss the man harder in the musical. I mean, that\u2019d be an odd thing for a straight man to say. It seems like he really enjoyed the kiss. Straight male actors who play gay male characters and kiss them may not feel grossed out by it, but if they\u2019re straight, why would they enjoy kissing men? On Junsu\u2019s birthday in 2008 (there\u2019s a video of this), the members gave him a shirt that says \u201cSorry girls, I\u2019m gay.\u201d One of the members said that she shirt is \u201cvery suitable for Junsu\u201d. This indicates that Jungsu has come out to his members. TXT Soobin- Gay. He\u2019s clearly into men and not women. Hueningkai- Gay. He\u2019s always given me gay vibes and he doesn\u2019t seem to be into women. Verivery Minchan- Bisexual. He seems to be into men and women. Kangmin- Gay. He seems very into men but not women. Victon Byungchan- Gay. He just seems very into men and not women. VIXX Ravi- Bisexual. He literally said that gender isn\u2019t important in liking someone or in a relationship. It\u2019s likely he was referring to his own experience as a bisexual. N- Gay. He seems more into men than women. And here are the members of girl groups that I think are LGBT: Blackpink Rose- Lesbian. She doesn\u2019t seem super into men but she seems into women. There\u2019s this one interview where she was being asked if she thought a male actor was cool. And she basically said yeah but then went on to talk about this female actress she said was really cute and who made her heart flutter. That sounds like she has a crush on this actress. The interviewer then asked Rose something alone the lines of \u201cWhat about (insert male actor\u2019s name)? A lot of people think he\u2019s cool\u201d. And then Rose was like \u201cYeah, he\u2019s cool.\u201d But she sounded uninterested in him. Also when blackpink were on Treasure Box, everyone seemed to be fangirling over the men except Rose. Rose even said \u201cYou guys love it so much!\u201d when the other members were fangirling about the guys. This reminds me about how my past lesbian friends would react over me fangirling about my male crushes. Lisa- Bisexual. She seems pretty into men but I also think she could be into women. Her favorite song is \u201cHoney\u201d by Kehlani which is all about liking girls. I don\u2019t think a straight woman would say that\u2019s her favorite song. Busters Hyeongseo- Lesbian. She doesn\u2019t show interest in men but she seems to show interest in women. Dreamcatcher Yooheon- bisexual. She was very specific about how she likes people and wasn\u2019t mentioning genders. F(x) Amber- Lesbian. No, it\u2019s not just because of her presentation but her presentation is a factor. Every single woman I\u2019ve met who\u2019s that masculine is lesbian or bisexual. This stereotype exists for a reason. Amber is friendly around guys but that\u2019s it. Just friendly. She treats them like bros and that\u2019s it. With women it\u2019s different. Yeah, she\u2019s friendly with them and I sense some attraction there. She also said she doesn\u2019t care if people think she\u2019s gay. I\u2019ve never met a straight woman who doesn\u2019t care if people think she\u2019s gay. (G)-IDLE Soyeon- Bisexual with female preference. She wrote the lyrics for \u201cOh My God\u201d and female pronouns are used. In the video for \u201cIdle Song\u201d, Soyeon goes to check out a girl and talks about wanting something fresh because her relationship with a man is getting boring. She also wore a shirt in the video that says I \u2764\ufe0f boys I\u2764\ufe0fgirls multiple times. Shuahua- Lesbian. She seems very into women but not men. Miyeon- Lesbian. So she said she wants to date someone who looks like her. I just think that\u2019s an odd thing for a straight girl to say. Girls Generation Taeyeon- Lesbian. She said the members could be the ideal types of both men and women. She also doesn\u2019t seem into men. I think her relationship with Baekhyun was fake. It was probably a publicity stunt that backfired. Taeyeon said in an interview that she wanted to sing a song to someone to confess her love to. The interviewer asked if the person was a guy. Taeyeon laughed and said no. She also said in an interview that she had a crush on a girl. And of course the interviewer quickly changed the subject. ITZY Ryujin- Lesbian. She doesn\u2019t seem into men. It\u2019s pretty ckear she\u2019s very into women. IZ*ONE Sakura- Bisexual with female preference. I think her female preference is pretty strong but she\u2019d still date a man. In an interview in 2017, she said that \u201chaving a true relationship is loving the parter based on their ideas...Things like gender come after...I could happen to like a woman\u201d. She said that looking at cute girls makes her feel better and that making a girl become super excited while cross dressing was really fun. She also said she would date Irene of Red Velvet but this was before all the stuff about Irene being rude to staff came out. Hyewon- Lesbian. She seems very into women but not men. Loona Yves- lesbian or bisexual. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s into men but I\u2019m certain she\u2019s into women. Here\u2019s what she said in her message to Sunmi: \u201ci don't know if you know me, but i'm Yves from Loona, i saw you at the broadcasting studio that one time, you winked while looking my direction, but did i just imagine that? i couldn't sleep that night, i even wrote it in my diary. I'd like for it to be true, if it is, please wink at me next time too. I'll wink back at you\" This sounds like she has a crush on Sunmi. Mamamoo Moonbyul- Lesbian. She seems very into women but not men. Red Velvet Wendy- Bisexual. She seems to show interest in both men and women. Twice Nayeon- Bisexual with male preference. I think it\u2019s pretty clear she\u2019s into men. But she\u2019s also said that she\u2019d want to be reborn as a man so she would know what it\u2019s like to have a girlfriend. There\u2019s also a video of her trying to kiss Rose of Blackpink, who I believe is lesbian. Momo- Bisexual with female preference. I thought she was a lesbian until I found out she was dating Heechul. Honestly, Momo seems uninterested in all men except for Heechul. There is this video from a few years ago where the members were playing a game involving which male actor was her ideal type. Momo seemed bored and irritated while some of the members seemed interested in this game. Momo seems very into women though. As I talked about before, there are people who are gay or straight then find themselves attracted to someone of the gender they thought they weren\u2019t into. I believe this happened with Momo when she started liking Heechul. It\u2019s also possible Momo is more into feminine looking men and Heechul is more feminine looking. I had a friend who thought she was lesbian but then she started becoming attracted to more feminine looking men. At this fansign, Mina and Momo were doing the peppero game and Sana pushed their heads together making their lips touch just a little bit. Mina (who I believe is straight) looked super embarrassed (I\u2019m sure her anxiety disorder contributed to that also) while Momo looked fake embarrassed and then just looked like \u201cyeah, whatever\u201d. When Momo was told to sing a song by JYP at this concert and she was supposed to say \u201cI have a man\u201d, she said \u201cI have a woman instead\u201d and didn\u2019t change the pronouns. Even when a couple other members told her to change them while she was singing. Sana- Lesbian. She doesn\u2019t seem very into guys. She also looked bored during that ideal type game. When Tzuyu (who I think is straight) was fangirling over male actors during the game, Sana said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t date them. It\u2019s just a game\u201d. Honestly, that sounds like something one of my past lesbian friends would\u2019ve said to me when I was fangirling about my male crushes. She also said that when she watches tv, she\u2019s more attracted to the women. No straight woman says this. Chaeyoung- Lesbian. She shows no interest in men but she\u2019s obviously interested in women. She\u2019s stared at female idols the way you would stare at your crush. She cut her hair because of Kristen Stewart. She enjoys being called a girl crush. She contributed to writing a song in one line is \u201cI\u2019m uninterested in men...I think puberty came late to me\u201d. Yeah, not the straightest thing ever. She chose to perform \u201cBorn This Way\u201d in Korea with a few other members. She chose the song. Wonder Girls Sunmi- Lesbian. She basically came out at a fan meet in Amsterdam. She said \u201cI have may sides to me like dorky and LGBT. LGBT queen.\u201d And then some seconds later she said \u201cThere are sides of me that I know very well like I just said\u201d. Sunmi said after the concert that she\u2019s not LGBT but LGBT supportive. I don\u2019t believe this and I\u2019ll explain why. It\u2019s very possible JYP created this fake narrative to protect Sunmi\u2019s career. Her career could\u2019ve been over if the world knew she was gay. Yes, she called herself an LGBT queen in the video but she didn\u2019t say wasn\u2019t LGBT. She literally said that she has an LGBT side to her and that she knows that side very well. Straight women don\u2019t say this. Also I\u2019m sure Sunmi is sick of hiding her sexuality and felt comfortable coming out in Amsterdam because she knows how progressive it is and her fans would support her. And the fans were screaming with excitement after she said she has and LGBT side. Also it\u2019s likely that she called herself an LGBT queen because she\u2019s aware that a lot of kpop fans are hailing Sunmi as an LGBT queen. This isn\u2019t the only reason why I think Sunmi is gay. I first thought she was LGBT when I watched the dance practices to Gashina and videos where she performed Gashina. The videos with the gender switch were different. Sunmi seemed much more comfortable and into it with the female dancers while she seemed robotic with the male dancers. And there are female idols that are comfortable with their male dancers and not robotic unlike Sunmi. When Sunmi is dancing with men, it\u2019s like \u201cOk gotta pretend to be into men. Whatever it\u2019s part of the job but not my jam.\u201d When Sunmi is dancing with women it\u2019s like \u201cYay, I get to dance with hot girls. This is totally my thing.\u201d Yubin- Lesbian. Yubin posted online predebut saying this: \u201cAny interested bitches contact me...so if you want to have some fun under me, try and seduce me now. You know I only want bottoms, right?\u201d I mean come on, this screams gay. Here\u2019s a soloist who I think is LGBT: Cheetah- Lesbian or bisexual. There are photos of her and a rumored girlfriend and the photos make them look like a couple. ",

            "answer_text": "THESE ARE MY OPINIONS: Chaeyoung TWICE (lesbian) - y\u2019all this is the most obvious one lol. I mean maybe I am wrong and she is straight but this woman loves women. She even had painted boobs on her nails. She watches mainly LGBTQ movies, hears many LGBTQ artist and songs, etc. Her Justin Bieber \u2018Boyfriend\u2019 cover she still used the same lyrics while Nayeon changed them to boy. At fan signs you can see the clear difference with her and fanboys vs fangirls lol. She also chose to perform \u2018Born This Way\u2019 despite South Korea being homophobic af! If there is one actually LGBTQ member of TWICE it\u2019s gotta be Chaeyoung. Sorry Sana stans but I find Sana more clingy and loving due to the fact she is an only child and loves having friends who are like siblings :).    Ryujin ITZY (BI) - I mean she literally said on a show that she gave a JYP representative her number just bc she found her cute. Ryujin also screams BI vibes lol.    Moonbyul MAMAMOO (Lesbian) - Ik she dresses more tomboy out of comfort but like she literally subliminally flirts with all her fangirls. I can name more women in love with her then men lol. She smirks bc she knows we all dying of gay panics lol.    Wendy RED VELVET (non label) - Ik most ppl assume Irene bc she has a funny relationship with men but Wendy gives me open minded vibes. I feel like Wendy would be chill and open minded to dating a girl. I feel like she also wouldn\u2019t have a label!    Sunmi (no label) - Ik Sunmi supports the LGBTQ community a lot but I feel she would also be open minded to dating a female. I feel bc how open and educated she is about the LGBTQ community she wouldn\u2019t have a label as well.    BTS Suga (pan) - I feel Yoongi would only care about if they are a good person not the gender!    Wonho (Pan) - same with Yoongi I believe he only cares about personality!    Irene RED VELVET (aromantic & demisexual) - I don\u2019t believe Irene is lesbian but I do think she is aromantic. I don\u2019t think she really cares for love. I just think she\u2019s too focused on her career and current life to be involved with love. Irene has men bowing down to her left and right but I don\u2019t think Irene really has interest or care! She also may be aromantic due to the fact so many guys care more about her beauty then her as a person.    TWICE Tzuyu (aromantic) - same situation as Irene. Tzuyu has so many admirers but I just don\u2019t think she really cares for any of that. Same with Irene she may feel or be this way bc too many ppl are invested in her beauty than her personality!    Sehun EXO (aromantic & asexual) - his own members talk about how sehun has no interest in dating or women. Sehun obviously has many female admirers but I don\u2019t think he really cares or trips!
