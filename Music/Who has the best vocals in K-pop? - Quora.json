            "answer_text": "Well it depends on male & female, the best singer is opinionated bc being a good singer mostly doesn\u2019t take technique into consideration(Selena Gomez) but being a good vocalist does take technique into consideration(Tori Kelly) I\u2019m only using idol singers such as Jihyo Seulgi.. not Sohyang, Ailee or Shannon. Since they don\u2019t really promote as KPOP IDOLS, rather as Korean singers.  Top 3 Male: 1.Kyuhyun - Super Junior  He has alot of freedom and support going on in his voice, as a male idol he can surpass multiple female idols. He has the most support in his voice starting from B2 up to B4/C5(also supported D5/Eb5 in studio)and even has a supported head voice up to F5. He has a very nice and natural vibrato and his agility is decent, he has very nice dynamics(volume control) a few issues he has; his head voice lacks resonance,vibrato can become a bit unstable while sustaining notes & his agility can get pitchy. 2.Ryeowook - Super Junior  what a surprise another SM vocalist, he aswell as Kyuhyun have alot of support and freedom in their voice. Their supported ranges are slightly different with Kyuhyun having the better lows, Ryewook has a very well developed head voice even out of his supported range his placement is still amazing. He has a very healthy vibrato and keeps consistent resonance in his voice. His support varies from D3 up to Bb4 and a supported head voice up to F#5/G5. A few issues he has; has some vowel issues, his pitch can get inconcistent and jaw tension can be present, his head voice is pretty pushed above G5 & and his agility being very sloppy. 3.Sandeul - B1A4  he was a pretty underrated main vocal, he didn\u2019t get as much attention as the others on this list. I\u2019m sure 70% of u don\u2019t know him, he has much support present in his voice like the other 2. Although he doesn\u2019t have a head voice he does have a relaxed falsetto up to E5, he has amazing tone production and you\u2019ll never catch his tone being flat. He\u2019s a very versatile vocalist with being able to sing different genres and he\u2019s also very smart as a vocalist. He doesn\u2019t try to sing too much out of his supported range or in a range where he knows he\u2019s not the most confident. A few issues; he has jaw and a bit of lip tension, nasality can be present in his voice, lower range is sometimes a bit airy but it might be stylistic and his mix can get OVERLY chesty.  Top 3 Female; 2nd Gen 1.Luna - F(X)  an SM vocalist, Luna first auditioned for being a dancer and SM wanted her to sing and look at her now. She has very wide range and alot of support, she has support carrying from G3 up to D5/Eb5 and Bb5 in head voice. She has a very developed head voice and is arguably her strongest register, has been able to produce resonant E5\u2019s at times. She has a healthy vibrato and a very forward placement while singing. The negatives; although having a light voice her voice lacks agility whenever she tries they come out very flat and just sound a bit off, her lows get very airy and ose tone below G#3, her head voice can be met with nasality and she can get fatigues at times. 2.Uji - BESTIE  Uji has one if not the best lower range for a female idol, she can go as low as C#3 and support is present starting from Eb3 which is pretty damn low(SHE IS A SOPRANO)her support in her mix is also very well developed going up to D5 and has produced resonance on C#5/D5. Her head voice is also pretty developed with having support up to F5, her pitch & dynamics is truly amazing. Now the negatives; although using a light singing approach her vocal agility is still pretty weak and is her least developed register, she tries to sing complex runs without having the proper skill for it. It\u2019s nice she tries it but it can make the performance a bit off when u just remember that complex run that wasn\u2019t a succes, her resonance is also a bit inconsistent in the C#5/D5 range & she gets very thin and strained above D5. 3.Taeyeon - SNSD/SOLO  SM hihihhihihi, Taeyeon is a very consistent vocalist. She\u2019s also very willing to improve, from debut till now Taeyeon has improved quite alot. From support and resonance, Taeyeon\u2019s lower range has improved the most probably from only being able to support A3/Bb3 to now having G3/G#3. Her placement is very very forward in the A4-D5 area and also shows alot of resonance in that area. Her resonance is fairly consistent and she has done some clean Eb5\u2019s with support, her head voice is supported but she rather sings with falsetto her head voice did decline a bit. Now the negatives; although having a very agile voice her runs can become sloppy and she can get a bit pitch, her pitch is also a bit inconsistent & she has issues with certain vowels. 3d Gen 1.Wendy - Red Velvet  SM lmao, Wendy debuted as a VERY strong vocalist with her being developed in all the registers and simply not having too much negatives, Wendy has a very well developed lower range with having support down to F#3 and tone down to Eb3. Her head voice is her most developed register with having support up to A5/Bb5 and occasional resonance, she also had a supported C6 in head voice. Her agility is very well developed and most of her riffs and runs come out clean, her mixed voice has support up to D5 and has done some Eb5\u2019s with support. Now the negatives; although having a very agile voice some of her runs can come out sloppy, her head voice can become shrill above B5 and she has a issue with her resonance not being consistent.2.Wheein - Mamamoo  has a very nice and soft tone but that barely stops her powerhouse vocals. Wheein has very nice support and resonance in the A4-C#5 area, her lows seem pretty decent and carry support down to G#3. Her resonance is very consistent and she has a very nice upper register although it only being falsetto it\u2019s nicely relaxed up to G5. Now to negatives; Wheein\u2019s resonance is rather pushed then natural, she also attempts alot of runs and although her voice being light she lacks proper seperation and her runs come out very sloppy & although most of the time having proper placement it can get nasal when she\u2019s not really carefula bout it. 3.Solar & Seunghee - OMG & MAMAMOO  Solar is very similar to Wheein with only her lows not being as good, Solar has very forward placement and her soft palate is lifted most of the time. Her resonance is very consistent up to C#5, she has very very nice and clean vocal transitions into her falsetto. Her pitch is amazing and she has a very good ear for harmonies and can easily sing the higher or lower part in a harmony. Now the negatives; her falsetto is very airy and disconnected it\u2019s also her least explored register, her mix is very chesty and her resonance is very pushed, likewise Wheein they both have weak agility with having issues with seperation and pitch & although her placement is kept as high as F#5 her larynx is still high and she often strains above D5.  Seunghee is pretty overlooked as a vocalist, she has very nice support and consistent resonance on B4 and a bit on C5\u2019s, she has produced supported head voice up to E5. Her mix is very light and although not having much support up there her placement is still kept very good and healthy, her lows seem to have support down to A3 and she has very nice dynamics and control. She has done some phrased D5\u2019s with support so she might be able to sustain them properly. Now the negatives; out of her supported range she tends to strain alot and her throat becomes a bit tight and very closed off which making it difficult for her to carry vocal freedom that high. Her head voice is pretty inconsistent and she can get a bit pitchy when attempting vocal runs. SPECIAL MENTION; Yuju - Gfriend  I wasn\u2019t 100% sure if i should add her to Solar & Seunghee but since she has slightly lost a bit of her resonance it\u2019s a bit iffy for me to decide. I don\u2019t say she\u2019s weaker then them, she\u2019s quite on the same level but she has undergone some issues that were rather serious and yes she\u2019s getting back on track but i\u2019m scared it will happen again in the future and might cause damage forever or just longer then last time it happened. So Yuju has very nice and clean support varying from A3 up to C5/C#5, she has been able to produce very resonant notes between A4-C#5 and just in general had very nice resonance. Her lows improved too and they went from only having Bb3 to now having A3 and some G#3\u2019s. Yuju has a connected head voice which also shows some support up to E5 but she mostly sings with falsetto. Yuju also had a very wide and impressive vocal range, being able to go as high as F#5 with not too much difficult and even had one resonant F5. Now to the negatives; like i mentioned she was known for her very high notes but that\u2019s partially also the reason of her having a period where she just couldn\u2019t sing anymore without transitioning(sunrise era up to crossroads)her resonance has been very inconsistent after that period and she has strained multiple C#5\u2019s which is pretty sad since she used to support them, she still supports the notes but she gets pretty tense these days and can tighten her throat alot and why i\u2019m afraid again is bc after sunrise they gave her a rest with all these high notes and i honestly thought \u2018\u2019wow the company is thinking about her\u2019\u2019 but now with apple she\u2019s doing the same and even did the highest note she ever hit(G5)and i\u2019m honestly scared that they will start doing the same as a few years ago. #PRAYFORYUJUSVOCALCORDS lol okie bye bye  ",
