            "answer_text": "There are a lot of great ones in Chronicles. \u201cI had very little in common with and knew even less about a generation that I was supposed to be the voice of. I\u2019d left my hometown only ten years earlier, wasn\u2019t vociferating the opinions of anybody.\u201d \u201cI really was never any more than what I was \u2014 a folk musician who gazed into the gray mist with tear-blinded eyes and made up songs that floated in a luminous haze. Now it had blown up in my face and was hanging over me. I wasn\u2019t a preacher performing miracles. It would have driven anybody mad.\u201d \u201cStudents trying to seize control of national universities, antiwar activist forcing bitter exchanges. Maoists, Marxists, Castroites \u2014 leftist kids who read Che Guevara instruction booklets were out to topple the economy.\u201d \u201cI was sick of the way my lyric had been extrapolated, their meanings subverted into polemics and that I had been anointed as the Big Bubba of Rebellion, High Priest of Protest, the Czar of Dissent, the Duke of Disobedience, Leader of the Freeloaders, Kaiser of Apostasy, Archbishop of Anarchy, the Big Cheese. What the hell are we talking about? Horrible titles any way you want to look at it. All code words for Outlaw.\u201d \u201cI felt like a piece of meat that someone had thrown to the dogs. The New York Times printed quacky interpretations of my songs. Esquire magazine put a four-faced monster on their cover, my face along with Malcom X\u2019s, Kennedy\u2019s and Castro\u2019s. What the hell was that supposed to mean? It was like I was on the edge of the earth.\u201d \u201cI had all the technical theory I would need. My audience would stop being a shady army of faceless people. Of course, some of them would still only concentrate on the lyrics and they might be dismayed because of the two-beat strum they\u2019d been used to for so long would now be off rhythm, refocused and rushing the songs into the heart of unimagined territory. But that\u2019s okay, they could handle it.\u201d (about Oh Mercy) \u201cA song is like a dream, and you try to make it come true. They\u2019re like strange countries that you have to enter.\u201d  There are also great ones from interviews, particularly in the interviews from the mid-sixties. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have so many, but I can find some. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to talk to you [journalist] afterwards. I got nothing to say about these things I write. I mean, I just write them. I don\u2019t have to say anything about them, I don\u2019t write them for any reason, there\u2019s no great message. I mean, if you wanna tell people that, go ahead and tell them, but I\u2019m not gonna have to answer to it. And people are gonna think \u2018what is Time magazine telling us?\u2019, but you couldn\u2019t care less about that either. You don\u2019t know the people that read you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a folk singer. You\u2019ll probably call me a folk singer, but other people know better. (\u2026) I could tell you why I\u2019m a folk singer and explain you why, but you wouldn\u2019t really understand. All you would do is nod your head.\u201d Responding to the journalist when asked if he cared for what he sang: \u201cYou got a lot of nerve asking me a question like that, do you ask the Beatles that?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not questioning you because I don\u2019t expect any answers from you.\u201d These were from a famous Time magazine interview in 65. You can also find a lot of great quotes in his San Francisco press conference from late 1965. I remember that after being confronted by a journalist who was trying to get Dylan to say he was ashamed of his \u201cpop\u201d conversion with Highway 61 Revisited and Bringing it all Back Home, he answered something like \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed, what do you want me to do? Crash the cameras and shout \u2018Hallelujah\u2019?\u201d  He used to say about \u201cTangled up in Blue\u201d in his concerts: \u201cThis song took me ten years to live and two years to write.\u201d  And from his songs, I have oh so many. I\u2019ll list some of my favorites. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019m smart, but I think I can see/ When somebody\u2019s pulling the wool over me/ And if this war comes and death\u2019s all around/ Let me die on this land \u2019fore I die underground/ Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground\u201d (\u201cLet me Die in my Footsteps) \u201cThe line it is drawn, the curse it is cast/ The slow one now will later be fast/ As the present now will later be past/ The order is rapidly fadin\u2019/ And the first one now will later be last/ For the times they are a-changin\u2019\u201d (\u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019\u201d) \u201cYour cracked country lips/ I still wish to kiss/ As to be under the strength of your skin/ Your magnetic movements still capture the minutes I\u2019m in/ But it grieves my heart, love/ To see you\u2019re trying to be a part of/ A world that just don\u2019t exist/ It\u2019s all just a dream, babe/ A vacuum, a scheme, babe/ That sucks you into feeling like this\u201d (\u201cTo Ramona\u201d) \u201cA self-ordained professor\u2019s tongue too serious to fool/ Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school/ \u2018Equality\u2019, I spoke the word as if a wedding vow/ But I was so much older then, I\u2019m younger than that now\u201d (\u201cMy Back Pages\u201d) \u201cAh, my friends from prison, they ask unto me/ \u2018How good, how good does it feel to be free?\u2019/ And I answer them most mysteriously/ \u2018Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?\u2019\u201d (\u201cBallad in Plain D\u201d) \u201cThrough the mad mystic hammering of the wild and ripping hail/ The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder/ That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze/ Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder\u201d (\u201cChimes of Freedom\u201d) \u201cThrough the wild cathedral evening, the rain unraveled tales/ For the disrobed faceless forms of no position/ Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts/ All down in taken-for-granted situations/ Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute/ Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute/ For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased and cheated by pursuit/ And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\u201d (\u201cChimes of Freedom\u201d) \u201cShe wears an Egyptian ring that sparkles before she speaks/ She\u2019s a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique\u201d (\u201cShe Belongs to Me\u201d) \u201cThe bridge at midnight trembles/ The country doctor rambles/ Bankers\u2019 nieces seek perfection, expecting all the gifts that wise men bring/ The wind howls like a hammer/ The night grows cold and rainy/ My love, she\u2019s like some raven at my window with a broken wing\u201d (\u201cLove Minus Zero/No Limit\u201d) \u201cTHe cloak and dagger dangles/ Madams light their candles/ In cerimonies of the horsemen, even the pawn must hold a grudge/ Statues made of matchstick crumbling into one another/ My love, she does not bother/ She knows too much to argue or to judge\u201d (\u201cLove Minus Zero/No Limit\u201d) I could use the entirety of \u201cIt\u2019s Alright Ma\u201d, but I\u2019m okay mentioning just a few: \u201cAdvertising signs, they con you into thinking you\u2019re the one that can do what\u2019s never been done, that can win what\u2019s never been won, meantime life outside goes on all around you\u201d \u201cA question in your nerves is lit, yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy, insure you not to quit, to keep it in your mind and not forget that it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to\u201d \u201cMy eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards, false gods, I scuff at pettiness, which plays so rough, walk upside-down inside handcuffs, kick my leg to crash it all and say \u2018okay, I\u2019ve had enough, what else can you show me?\u2019 And if my though dreams could be seen, they\u2019d probably put my head in a guillotine\u201d Now others again: \u201cThough you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly through the sun/ It\u2019s not aimed at anyone, it\u2019s just escaping on the run/ And but for the skies there are no fences facing/ And if you hear vague traces of skipping wheels of rhyme/ To your tambourine in time, it\u2019s just a ragged clown behind, I wouldn\u2019t pay it any mind/ It\u2019s just a shadow you\u2019re seeing that he\u2019s chasing\u201d (\u201cMr. Tambourine Man\u201d) \u201cRelationships of ownership, they whisper in the wings/ To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings/ And I try to harmonize with songs, the lonesome sparrow sings/ And there are no kinds inside the gates of Eden\u201d (\u201cGates of Eden\u201d) \u201cAt times I think there are no words but these to tell what\u2019s true/ And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden\u201d (\u201cGates of Eden\u201d) \u201cLeave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you/ FOrget the dead you\u2019ve left, they will not follow you/ The vagabond who\u2019s rapping at your door/ Is standing on the clothes that you once wore/ Strike another match, go start anew/ And it\u2019s all over now Baby Blue\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s All Over Now, Baby Blue\u201d) \u201cWell, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown/ You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground/ There ought to be a law against you coming around/ You should be made to wear earphones\u201d (\u201cBallad of a Thin Man\u201d) \u201cYou\u2019ve been with the professors and they all liked your looks/ With the great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks/ You\u2019ve been through all of Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s books/ You\u2019re very well read, it\u2019s well known\u201d (\u201cBallad of a Thin Man\u201d) \u201cPraise be Nero\u2019s Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn/ Everybody shouting \u2018which side are you on?\u2019/ And Erza Pound and T.S. Elliot, fighting in the captain\u2019s tower/ While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers/ Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow/ And nobody has to think too much about desolation row\u201d (\u201cDesolation Row\u201d) \u201cNow Ophelia, she\u2019s \u2019neath the window, for her I feel so afraid/ On her twentieth birthday, she already is an old maid/ To her, death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest/ Her profession\u2019s her religion, her sin is her lifelessness/ And though her eyes stare upon Noah\u2019s great rainbow,/ She spends her time peeking into desolation row\u201d (\u201cDesolation Row\u201d) \u201cWIth your silhouette when the sunlight dims/ Into your eyes where the moonlight swims/ And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns/ Who among them would try to impress you?\u201d (\u201cSad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\u201d) The list is pretty long already, so I\u2019ll shorten it a little. \u201cSo sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine/ The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen/ Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I\u2019m at/ I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that\u201d (\u201cDirge\u201d) \u201cShe opened up a book of poems and handed it to me/ Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century/ And every one of the words rang true and glowed like burning coal/ Pouring off of every page, as it was written in my soul from me to you/ Tangled up in blue\u201d (\u201cTangled up in Blue\u201d) \u201cI noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways have finally made you blind/ I can\u2019t remember your face anymore, your mouth\u2019s changed, your eyes don\u2019t look into mine/ The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned/ I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned/ Slowly into autumn\u201d (\u201cIdiot Wind\u201d, this is probably my favorite of his entire career) \u201c \u2018Gentlemen\u2019, he said/ \u2018I don\u2019t need your organization/ I\u2019ve shined your shoes, I\u2019ve moved your mountains and marked your cards/ But Eden is burning/ Either get ready for elimination/ Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards\u2019\u201d (\u201cChanging of the Guards\u201d) \u201cThere\u2019s a wall between you and what you want, and you got to leap it/ Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won\u2019t have the power to keep it\u201d (\u201cThe Groom\u2019s Still Waiting at the Altar\u201d) \u201cWell, they\u2019ll choose a man for you to meet tonight/ You\u2019ll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors/ How to enter into the gates of paradise/ Now, how you carry a burden too heavy to be yours/ Yeah, from the stage they\u2019ll be trying to get water outta rocks/ A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks/ They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in/ Sing \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 all the way to the Swiss banks\u201d (\u201cFoot of Pride\u201d) \u201cWell, I head that hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents/ The stars above the barren trees were his only audience/ Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well/ But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell\u201d (\u201cBlind Willie McTell\u201d) \u201cThey tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes,/ They tell me revenge is sweet, and from where they stand I\u2019m sure it is/ But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized/ All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes\u201d (\u201cDark Eyes\u201d) \u201cOh the French girl, she\u2019s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel/ Hunger pays a heavy price to the fallen gods of speed and steel/ And time is short and the days are sweet, and passion rules the arrow that flies/ A million faces at my feet, but all I see are dark eyes\u201d (\u201cDark Eyes\u201d) \u201cI was born here and I\u2019ll die here, against my will/ I know it looks like I\u2019m moving, but I\u2019m standing still/ Every nerve in my body feels so vacant and numb/ I can\u2019t even remember what it was I came here to get away from/ Don\u2019t even hear a murmur of a prayer/ It\u2019s not dark yet, but it\u2019s getting there\u201d (\u201cNot Dark Yet\u201d) \u201cThey say prayer has the power to help/ So pray from the mother/ In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell/ I\u2019m trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others/ But oh, mother, things ain\u2019t going well\u201d (\u201cAin\u2019t Talkin\u2019\u201d) \u201cI\u2019ll give you justice, I\u2019ll fatten your purse/ Show me your moral virtues first/ Hear me holler, hear me moan/ I pay in blood, but not my own\u201d (\u201cPay in Blood\u201d) \u201cOn marble slabs and in fields of stone/ You make your humble wishes known/ I touched the garment but the hem was torn/ In Scarlet Town, where I was born\u201d (\u201cScarlet Town\u201d)  While writing this, I just remembered he wrote some great texts for the textbooks in some of his albums. My favorite is from Bringing it all Back Home, which through most of the text, Dylan freezes time, right after his recording engineer asks him a question. \u201ci have given up at making any attempt at perfection/ the fact that the white house is filled with leaders that\u2019ve never been t the apollo theater amazes me. why allen ginsberg was not chosen t read poetry at the inauguration boggles my mind\u201d \u201ci am convenced that all souls have some superior t deal with/like the school system, an invisible circle of which no one can think without consulting someone/in the face of this, responsibility/security, success mean absolutely nothing\u201d \u201ci would not want t be bach. mozart. tolstoy. joe hill. gertrude sten or james dean/they are all dead. the Great books\u2019ve been written. the Great sayings have all been said\u201d If you want more quotes from his songs, I\u2019d highly suggest the albums Another Side, Bringing it all Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde, John Wesley Harding, Planet Waves, Blood on the Tracks, Desire, Street Legal, Slow Train Coming, Shot of Love, Infidels, Oh Mercy, Time out of Mind, Love and Theft, Modern Times and Tempest. There are some bootlegs with new songs, too, but you should focus on Bootleg 1\u20133: Rare and Unreleased. ",
