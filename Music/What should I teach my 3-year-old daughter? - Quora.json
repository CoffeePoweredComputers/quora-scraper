            "answer_text": "Emotional He should learn that he is separate from his parents, and that he has a will and can assert it. (The \u201cterrible twos\u201d are developmentally important.) He should also have learned that no matter how much he asserts his will, his parents are CONSISTENTLY in charge, in control of themselves, and capable of protecting him. Gross motor He should have the ability to jump but probably doesn\u2019t have skipping yet (hop on one leg, step, hop on the other leg, step). More: Gross Motor Preschool Milestones 3 years to 5 years - North Shore Pediatric Therapy Fine motor He should be able to manually move a crayon around but probably can\u2019t stay within lines, even roughly (they\u2019re \u201cscribbles\u201d). Girls often have faster fine-motor development. I hate the scare-headline, but here\u2019s a good list: Fine Motor Skills Interpersonal He should definitely be able to play side-by-side, and should at 3 be able to have some interactions (like co-creating stories). He won\u2019t likely be particularly subtle at getting people to do what he wants. He also will understand the \u201csharing\u201d concept but will likely still find it extremely difficult, particularly when he\u2019s uncomfortable. Cognitively He should understand shape (shape sorters) and relative size (he will not go down the bathtub drain), though the latter may be more recent or still developing \u2014 don\u2019t scare him; they really don\u2019t understand this until they understand relative sizes (\u201cbigger\u201d). Many kids understand sequence, so you can do counting and alphabet with those kids. Some kids understand how to attach a sound to a shape and can begin reading \u2014 but not many. He probably has favorite songs and stories (remembering sequence) and will be able to remember people over time \u2014 probably not six months, but probably at least a month if they\u2019re familiar, and at least a few days or so if it\u2019s a new person. He should have enough of a working vocabulary to understand more complex instructions like \u201csofter, gently, quietly\u201d but will definitely need help in self-control particularly when tired and hungry. \u201cInside/outside\u201d behaviors \u2014 clumping them together, like outside we run around and scream, inside we use less energy \u2014 will be more or less understood, but again will need a lot of reminders. That said a 3 year old should have enough self control and cognitive capacity to avoid touching a stove, putting a fork in an electrical outlet, or pulling things off the counter top. What I would work on: Plenty of physical expression. Their bodies are in hyperdrive. Gross motor when there\u2019s space and you can supervise; fine motor when they need \u201cquiet time.\u201d And be patient training \u201csit still.\u201d (Give yourself 12 cups of coffee, and then \u201csit still\u201d!)Assess where he is in sequence and count together and say or sing the alphabet together (they love that). They\u2019ll make mistakes, it\u2019s ok; you\u2019re just getting them used to sequences. You can see if they can accept a \u201cB\u201d makes a \u201cbuh\u201d sound but that\u2019s likely not going to be interesting for them as much as gross and fine motor mastery, which they\u2019re much more driven towards, so don\u2019t do that unless they\u2019re pushing for it. You can count by twos if your kids are particularly adept at counting (and/or you\u2019re bored), and movement helps memory, so this game is great for stairs, walking around the block, jumping\u2026Sharing. Sharing when tired. Sharing a favored thing. Sharing a substitute item because they just can\u2019t part with their favorite thing. Saying how they feel about sharing. Saying what they feel about pretty much anything. Note they will really not have much vocabulary for this unless the family explicitly talks about how they feel a lot, and a lot of the time, hearing parents say they feel scared or angry is utterly overwhelming to kids\u2026 so they probably will not have a way to express that unless you help them directly.Role playing games. Dress up. This is important for empathy development. Let them be the cat, the neighbor, the parent, the kid at school who bugs them so much\u2026",

            "answer_text": "How to be polite:  Please, Thank You, Sorry.  Those initial social skills are so important with all social interactions, because they're the foundation of understanding how you affect those around you.How to play:  Kids develop an imagination around then.  Play with them.  Join in.  Encourage that creativity.How to trust you:  You will always be there.  To keep her safe, to scare the shadows away, to comfort her when she's in pain.  That makes her feel safe and protected.How to talk to you:  Communication is one of the biggest social skills there is.  Teach her names for her emotions.  \"Are you scared?\" \"Do you hurt?\" \"Are you mad?\" \"Are you happy?\"  Little kids scream when they don't have the tools to express themselves any other way.  By teaching her how to name what she's feeling, you can validate how she feels and help to fix/understand it.  You have to really listen to her.How to share:  I'm working on this out with my son currently.  There is a social contract between kids that they have to learn.  But it's a really important thing to learn and understand early on.  You can demonstrate on a daily basis.In summary:  The most important thing you can teach her is how to interact with other people.  The earlier she learns that, the more successful she will be. ",

I laugh hard when my niece cries.A trick if have been playing of late to keep my 3 year old niece shut is by pulling my mobile and saying her that I'd take a pic of her crying face and put it up on computer/facebook/to their teachers at the kindergarden. :)The importance of personal hygiene. Make it a habit that she washes her hands regularly.Sweet little things like thank you, welcome and I'm sorry. Turns her compassionate to people and surroundings. She learns from you. Thank the auto driver after your trip, the one who holds the door at the restaurant and if you are from India, make it a point to show dignity of labor atleast when she's around. Good sleeping habits. Your names, city, designation, office names. Possibly your home address too. When you roam out show her a police and how to identify one and tell her he's a good guy.Above all, make her believe that her dad is a super hero. Strive to be one. ",
