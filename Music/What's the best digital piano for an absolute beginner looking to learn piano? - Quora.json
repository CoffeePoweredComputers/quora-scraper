            "answer_text": "I think that's a bit expensive for a beginner, but if you can afford it, go for it. You can't go wrong with that as long as you keep it up. Personally, I'd say go try out some digital pianos at a store and see cheaper options for yourself, but if you're a complete beginner, you probably don't know what \"feels right.\"  So do this: Go to a piano store, sit on some Steinways, Yamahas, and Estonias and press down on some keys. Press down softly. Press down sharp and hard. Press down lightly and slowly. Press down normally. Rest your fingers on the keys. Notice how different and dynamic each note sounds according to how you press, strike, or caress each of the keys. Notice how the keys feel. It will take some effort--but a comfortable, natural effort--to make those keys depress and play a note. Feel how the keys come back up upon your fingers as you let it rise. It should feel smooth. This is all due to the action of the piano. This is how a real piano feels and sounds. The keys are \"weighted.\" Your digital piano needs to mimic this as best as possible.  Now look down at your feet. You'll see three pedals. Press the pedal to the very right and press a key. Note that the sound is sustained. This is the sustain pedal. Now let go of that pedal and press the pedal to the very left and press a key. Notice that the sound of the note is duller and soft. This is the soft pedal. Your digital piano needs these as well.   Now go try some digital pianos. First cross out all the pianos that do not have 88 keys. Then start trying them out and see which of them feel and sound like the real pianos you played earlier. You'll notice that the cheap ones won't vary in sound no matter how hard or soft you strike the keys. You'll also notice that the keys depress almost instantly as you rest your fingers. These are the terrible ones. Don't bother with these. Next, you'll find a group of digital pianos with a bit of weight to them and a bit of variation to the sound of notes, but it feels almost cheap. The keys clunk down and rebound back up. They feel hollow. As you let the keys come back up upon your fingers, it doesn't quite feel right. Don't go for these as well. They're worth considering if the price is cheap, but try to avoid these. Next, you'll find a group that feels just the real thing. Go for these. Some brands may or may not last longer than others, but that will take years and years. Finally, check and see if there are pedals by your feet. Once you find a few that meet your criteria (1. 88 keys, 2. weighted keys, 3. soft and sustain pedal), compare prices and go buy it.  I hope this helps. Happy learning. ",
