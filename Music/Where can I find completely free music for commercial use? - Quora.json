            "answer_text": "Good luck with that! I\u2019ve been trying to find such a site. I consider a song to be \u201cfree\u201d when logging on to the site is free, downloading and using the song for commercial purposes is free, and there are no stipulations attached to the song: in other words, when you don\u2019t have to give the musicians credit, and you don\u2019t have to attribute the song. You\u2019ll find that anything that is \u201croyalty-free\u201d is not free at all. You have to pay for the song, and once you\u2019ve paid for it, then you can keep using it. And then, any site you find that has music or sounds that are totally free, are not necessarily free at all, because no site is going to spend money to do an investigation of each song to make sure that someone hasn\u2019t uploaded someone else\u2019s not-free song! So beware that anything you get from a site of free music or sounds could get you sued if the original maker of the song shows up. Just because someone signs a form saying that the song they are giving away for free to a website that contains free songs does not mean that they are the true inventor of the song: they may not even know themselves who created the \u201cfree\u201d song! There are a few places that have 10-second clips of such songs, but if you want anything more than that, please let me know when you find it! :) The bottom line: don\u2019t assume that ANY song or sound effect you download from any site, free or for money, is 100% free. Investigate, investigate, investigate your \u201cfree\u201d song or sound effect that you\u2019ve downloaded, and be prepared to remove it if the real originator shows up, or even\u2026\u2026.to be sued! Why am I going on and on and on about this? For one thing, if Article 13 (you can Google it) actually does completely pass, you can get sued and even immediately taking down the \u201cfree\u201d song or special effect may not keep you from getting sued. My advice: create your own songs and special effects. ",

            "answer_text": "Nowhere. Commercial usage require that you hold the broadcasting rights - which must be bought. Simple as really. You can ask smaller and independent artists who perhaps haven't signed up with PRS if they would let you use their song for an advert or video maybe. They certainly, probably wouldn't let you put it in a compilation album for sale without paying royalties. If you know a musician who will create music for free for you to use then you can do it that way but no way on Earth will you find free music for commercial usage on-line. It's illegal and unlike simply pirating for personal use, it carries a harsher penalty - also you can get sued. Long story short. Don't do it. Get someone to make it for you - which means you can agree to share rights. Otherwise you must buy it. ",
