            "answer_text": " First of all we need to debunk a common misconception : Facebook is blocked, but not banned. FB was introduced in China circa 2005 and had been around in Chinese cyberspace until 2009, in the aftermath of several deadly racial riots organised via FB, amid deteriorating relations between FB and Chinese authorities who demandEd the name of those agent provocateurs and organizers be handed over to them which FB refused. FB was subsequently blocked, along with Twitter, Google and Youtube which allowed a free hand to extremists and separatists to pose misinformation freely on their platforms. Around this time social equivalents and alternatives such as QQ, Wechat, Weibo,Baidu, Youku began to take over Chinese social media. The Chinese authorities\u2019 decision to block FB, Google, Twitter etc was vindicated with the Snowden defection revealing that Facebook, Twitter and Google are social media fronts for US spy agency NSA, PRISM scandal, Arab Spring revolutions in Tunisia/Egypt , color revolution in Ukraine, umbrella revolution in Hongkong , and most recently, President Trumps\u2019 rant against lying US mainstream media. Even Hillary Clinton has this to say: \u201cThe epidemic of fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the last year \u2015 it\u2019s now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.\u201d[1] This is a classic case of getting a taste of one\u2019s own medicine, after fake news were first being propagated across FB, Twitter, YouTube and Google to smear mainland China seven years ago. Just yesterday, Thomas Oppermann, a senior lawmaker in Maas\u2019 Social Democratic Party, told German weekly Der Spiegel that dominant social media sites like Facebook could be required to delete illegal posts within 24 hours or face fines up to 500,000 euros ($A715,900).[2] And just after Trump\u2019s inauguration, White House Spokesperson blasted the US media for dishonest reporting on the crowd turnout during Trump\u2019s inaugural speech.[3] If FB is not banned, then it is a matter of time when FB becomes unblocked in Chinese cyberspace. There is no urgency for FB to keep expanding since it already has more than a billion subscribers but Mark probably realised how hyprocritical his creation has become with respect to mainland China when being used as a tool to subvert Chinese authorities, promote bigotry against mainland Chinese and wanton bad-mouthing of mainland China, while concurrently being used to sing praises on Hongkong/Taiwanese Chinese. [4] He took a couple years to get his house in order With more stringent filtering of malicious content targeting mainland China( to the detriment of FB backers such as the CIA and FBI) He is also working very hard to ensure FB complies with Chinese censorship laws and has also recently rented an office space in Beijing CBD in anticipation of the return. Redemption beckons for FB but people had moved on with other alternatives and it will be difficult to crack into the Chinese market especially when you are late to the party. Being late to the game , Facebook\u2019s Messenger has to copy many of the features of WeChat, like mobile payment, money transfer, business accounts and merchant interactions in order to prepare its comeback to the Chinese market. Anyways better late than never.

            "answer_text": "UPDATE: GMT October 30, 2017, Mark Zuckerberg meet China's Xi Jinping in Beijing, as an adviser of Tsinghua University business school. It seems that Facebook has taken a great step to enter the Chinese market.  What does this mean? Let\u2019 see Xi Jinping's speech first: While ensuring China's sovereignty, security and development interests, the country will remain committed to reform and opening up and adopt a mutually-beneficial and higher-quality approach to opening up, the president said. The implication behind this speech has two aspects: China will not close its doorsChina's sovereignty, security and development interests are the first prerequisite for opening up.S0, now it's Zuckerberg's turn to take some practical actions. wait and see.  Today, it seems that everyone knows why China banned Facebook, but few people know that Facebook is planning to step into China step by step. Too much political debate about why China banned Facebook is of little significance.As a Chinese, I\u2019m look forward to using Facebook in China someday. Here are some of the clues I've taken from the media coverage: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 In 2009, China blocked Facebook .In July 2014, Facebook rented an office in the northern third ring road in Beijing to form an advertising team[1] .In October 22, 2014, Zuckerberg walked into Chinese universities as an advisor, visited Tsinghua University, spoke in Mandarin, and joined the Advisory Committee of Tsinghua School of economics and management in the same period[2].Lu Wei, the director of the State Internet Information Office, made an on-the-spot investigation in silicon valley, accompanied by Zuckerberg, who displayed the books of Xi Jinping on his seat. In September 2015, Xi Jinping visited the United States to participate in the Eighth SINO-US internet forum. At the subsequent White House dinner, Xi jinping was asked to give a chinese name for his upcoming child, but was turned down. Mark Zuckerberg wished a Happy Lunar New Year to everyone who liked his page in February 7, 2016In March 2016, Zuckerberg came to China again to participate in the China High-rise Development Forum sponsored by the State Council Development Research Center and undertook by the China Development Research foundation. The photograph which he ran through Tiananmen square were widely spread over the Internet.  In November 2016, NYT reported that Facebook is developing censorship tool to get back into China.
