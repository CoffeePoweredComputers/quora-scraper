            "answer_text": "Hey, So, it is really tough to get permission to use music from the big music companies. The reasons just being the shear size of the company. It can be easy if you have some type of contacts in the company who can help you out getting these permissions. But I'd suggest you to find copyright free music, that you can use in your content without any restrictions. ( Although don't forget to give credits to the original creator, because yes, they deserve that ). And about adding the license part to your video, I don't have much idea about that. But once your video gets a copyright strike, you can File a Dispute. Check out Home for the best sounds with no copyright issues. ( Tap the link, it shows HOME, but it will work ). Cheers, The Xenial Secret ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Actually this is extremely difficult to do . Big companies don\u2019t allow small creators to use their music easily for commercial purposes. If you have a close contact with someone you know in the company at a high position you can then easily use the music , just ask him/ her. Also if the part you are taking must be short. I mean less than 10 seconds. Also give due credits in the description and video. Thats all Still if the company files a copyright claim\u2026 Nothing much will happen \u2026 just the money earned for that video will go to the music company instead of you. Thanks!! ",
