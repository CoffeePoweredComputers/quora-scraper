            "answer_text": "As a broad statement this is not true, and I say this as someone from the UK. It is a very time dependent thing. Just to put things in my perspective my musical tastes developed from my mid teens to my mid twenties, as I believe many peoples core preferences arise. For me this was the 1970s. It is well documented that there was a \u2018British Invasion\u2019 of the US in the 60s/70s starting with groups like the Beatles, the Who, the Kinks, the rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, the Tremeloes , Hermans Hermits, the Spencer Davies Group etc. this was followed in the 70s by the big rock groups like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Genesis etc. It is of note that innovative US musicians like Jimi Hendrix were not original appreciated at home until they came to the UK and their music was raised to prominence there. These were all innovative groups producing music that was different to the norm. However, they were generally influenced by American music from the 1950s/early 1960s, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Muddy Waters and the hugely influential B.B.King. I think it would be fair to say that in the 1950s/ early 1960s US popular music was better. After the 1970s, the US was playing catch up and were being influenced by the earlier UK music. The question of \u2018better\u2019 becomes more subjective to me as my core musical taste was established in 1970s UK rock, particularly progressive rock. I still have the feeling that the US rock groups are \u2018imitations\u2019 of what I consider the \u2018originals\u2019 but admit that many are very good and to a US audience may be considered better. Later, my \u2018grumpy old man\u2019 nature comes into play and, with what I consider to be \u2018over produced\u2019 music I cannot differentiate between US and UK music. ",

            "answer_text": "the reason may lie in the cultural background and your personal taste.Since the variety of races in U.S. ,it is inevitable that black american elements are integrated into Rock music. In general, one can say that britpop is more skillful than rock music in the states. Some american rock haters just think that it is too loud for them and with no profound meanings. ",
