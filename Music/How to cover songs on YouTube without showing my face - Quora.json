            "answer_text": "I can tell you how I do YouTube videos on my MacBook Pro. I get whatever image I want to use (it can be a still or a video.) Then I record my song (I use Apple GarageBand DAW.) I go into iMovie and build a video, importing my image by drag and drop, the same with my audio track. There it is possible to manipulate the video by fading to black at the end or any number of effects. I then hit export to YouTube and it\u2019s done. No worries about my face. I don\u2019t know if you can do that with an iPh0ne or any other phone, I always use a computer. There are audio and video apps you can get for Windows, too. To get yourself out of the picture simply you could just angle the camera (or phone) so that your face is not shown, just your instrument and hands. That is the simplest way and I have seen many such \u201ccover\u201d songs presented like that. I don\u2019t think anybody cares what you look like anyway. ",

In conclusion, just fix your camera position. Thank you! ",
