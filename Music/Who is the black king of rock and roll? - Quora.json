            "answer_text": "I'm guessing if you going to throw a color component into it, the first would have been Chuck Berry. Let's face it\u2026.without Chuck and a number of others, we don't have Rock and Roll, we don't have Hendrix and we don't have Prince. I could have said Bo Diddley but I think Chuck had more of an effect on the overall scene. Then there's Jimi Hendrix! It's hard to put into words the effects Jimi had on guitar of course, but Rock in general with only a few albums and a number of concerts. And I've got to say that I feel that Prince was the one that picked up the rock baton after that. All of these players stand plenty tall just on their own merits. ",
