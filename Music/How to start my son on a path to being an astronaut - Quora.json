            "answer_text": "The most important thing is to support and feed their interest without taking control of their interest. You have to be constantly ready to offer up something but they have to feel that they are in charge of their own future. So, your job is to find resources and opportunities for them. To Inspire and Motivate Them LEAST EXPENSIVE OPTIONS There\u2019s a lot of great information available for free on the Internet. Visit the NASA Kids Club website NASA Kids Club to find puzzles, games, and other activities for kids of varying ages.  NASA\u2019s The Space Place is also a good site to find information, activities, games, puzzles, and quizzes: NASA's Space Place :: Home :: NASA's The Space Place NASA has designed its website so that it can easily be filtered for kids based on grade level. Here are the links:Kids in kindergarten through 4th grade: For Students K-4Kids in 5th through 8th grade: For Students 5-8Kids in 9th through 12th grade: For Students 9-12 NASA has a page NASA - Astronaut Biographies where you can find biographies of each of the astronauts. If they want to be an astronaut, learning about the real people can be very inspiring and a great way for you to help them see that although it involves a lot of hard work, it is certainly a feasible path for a child. Maybe give them a biography a week to read. They can learn about people like Sally Ride, Guion Bluford, Ellen Ochoa, Leland Melvin, Peggy Whitson, and Tracy Caldwell Dyson. Use Quora. You and your child can have some great conversations that will feed their interest and help them learn. Come to Quora and look up questions like How high in the atmosphere can you go before you start to float in Zero G? or How many people are there in space? to come up with ideas of things to talk about. Or if they have a question and you don't know the answer, come here and ask it. People like me will be happy to answer it for you so you can then go back and explain it to them. If your TV provider offers NASA TV, check it out. If they don't, you can view it online, here: NASA TV. MOST EXPENSIVE OPTIONS NASA has an initiative called the the Passport to Explore Space program (NASAPassport to Explore Space - VisitNASA.com - NASA Visitor Centers). It\u2019s a program through which kids complete a passport by visiting all 14 NASA visitor centers and Space Shuttle museum exhibits. They are scattered all over the country, from California to New York, so this could be an expensive endeavor. I know it\u2019s not something my parents could have afforded when I was a child. Here's a picture of the first person to complete her passport. Her name is Alyssa Carson and she was 13 when she completed it. She's standing next to astronaut Wendy Lawrence.  If you decide to visit a NASA visitor center, be sure to look on-line first to see if there are scheduled activities. You might be able to have lunch with an astronaut. There are also great Space Camp programs at the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida, and at the Marshall Space Flight Center, in Alabama. Kids of all ages can participate in day or week or longer programs that give them hands-on experience. To Prepare ThemMost of the rest of this answer is stuff you won't need to worry about until they are in high school. To help your child grow into a great candidate for the Astronaut Program is a holistic effort. They\u2019ll need to build both their mind and body. NASA looks for well rounded applicants. They will need to do well in all of their school subjects and should engage in athletics too. Cross-country running is very popular amongst many astronauts. Astronauts come from many backgrounds, so they have a lot of options. The three most common are engineer, pilot, or medical doctor. But NASA has selected everything from chemists to Navy Seals. They should choose a path that they could live with, because they will have to live with it, for a while. Being an astronaut is not a first career - it is a second career. Their priority should be to excel at that first career, because the astronaut selection panel isn't impressed by average. What types of selections NASA makes for each class depends on their needs at the time. Sometimes they need to backfill pilots that have left. Sometimes they need to beef up the mission specialist ranks. The safest path is probably to combine engineering and being a pilot. Apply to a university with a decent aerospace engineering department and ROTC program. Get that bachelors in engineering, go into the military, and train to be a pilot. Excel as a pilot and in their spare time allow the government to pay for their masters degree. Education and career achievement are not the only things she needs to be working on, though. Do things. Scuba dive, learn to fly, teach classes, volunteer for charities, be a scout leader, travel, learn to speak Russian, engage in competitive sports. The selection panel is looking for dynamic self-motivated individuals that can learn quickly, handle stress, take orders, and communicate well with the public. ",

Imagine instead that your son leads a supremely happy, fulfilling and long life. Then love him. Talk to him. Listen to him. Provide him with diverse opportunities to explore and interact with the world. Listen some more. Read him books, sing him songs, give him art and craft supplies to create anything he imagines. Play games. Have fun. Love him some more. Empathize with his feelings. Anticipate his needs. Encourage his passions. Empathize some more. If you are right, that he would make an excellent astronaut, he will discover that himself. If on the other hand, you tell him you want him to be an astronaut, he may rebel. He may swear that is the last thing he ever wants to be. Or he may go ahead and become an astronaut. But if you have told him you think he should be an astronaut, and he becomes an astronaut, you will never know if he pursued that dream because it was his dream, or because it was your dream. So you will never know if he is truly happy. ",

I would enjoy my new born, watch him grow and let him know the following: A. He is awesome just the way he is. B. He doesn\u2019t need to earn my love, he can be a bus boy and I\u2019ll still love him and be proud. C.

As regards being an Astronaut- Your job as a parent would be to make available sources of information to him and see which one he follows. Good education, and preferably a degree in Engineering, physics or one of the pure sciences would be very essential to his being recruited into NASA. Keep encouraging him to participate in sports as also being an astronaut is not a solo-event but a team activity for its success.So there is a lot you can do, and I wish you all the best in providing for your child. Your living style need not be a factor, as long as you provide for the education and sports scope- for him to indulge. ",
