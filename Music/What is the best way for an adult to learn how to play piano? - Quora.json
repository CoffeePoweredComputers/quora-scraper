            "answer_text": "That\u2019s THREE different skills or activities, not one. They get unified at various points of activity, but let\u2019s start with playing piano. Get your hands on it, explore lots of playing, how the fingers can stretch, different tones it can make, and do practices of running up and down the piano with one hand playing it, to get the fingers used to playing in a key and hitting THOSE notes only, and learn some keys, such as C major, E minor, A sharp major, etc., and just build your physical skill, your interaction with the instrument daily.To read music, I found it amazingly helpful to listen to some music while watching the sheet music of it at the same time. You\u2019ll need to learn not only the notes, but how they show loudness, length of note, rests, slurs, sharp attacks, etc., by using notation like a language. Buy a music notation book, and also buy some enjoyable classical music and then buy the sheet music for it too. A concerto or symphony would be helpful, so you can follow along either with one instrument, or lots of instruments, so see how it moves, see the notation and see how instruments are combined. There are also YouTube videos of computer readouts of sheet music, showing the music being played on the sheet at the same time you hear it. Look for those!To write music is a natural extension of developing your ability from the #2 answer above, and then grabbing some blank sheet music paper and a pen. If you want to write your own music, one trick I use is to simply write down notes on the C-key in the upper clef of sheet music, and then I can capture anything, a whistled riff, a longer musical idea, something I hear on the radio, and write down the notes, and then I can reset the key or correct the notation later. But at least I\u2019ve captured the essence of it immediately in enough detail to make me hear it again as soon as I see it on the sheet. Practice this. Use simple music. Just practice it, but also build your skills by learning notation with the #2 answer above.Send me a copy of your first CD.",

            "answer_text": "The best way for an adult to learn is to first learn how NOT to learn piano. The standard methods that have been around for generations are a horror show of failures. And 5 black keys matter horror show rules apply: 1: Don\u2019t play with zombies! Therefore don\u2019t study or practice music scales; those scales are zombified, once living musical snippets that move you to tears \u2018cuz all the life\u2019s drained out of them. 3: Don\u2019t look for a piano life in the morgue! Therefore avoid music theory like the deadly plague that it is. Music Theory is a Dr. Frankenstein morgue overrun with zombies and other once living music parts. It\u2019s where musical cadavers undergo intensive lab analysis. The cadavers and various dead music parts get stitched back together to become somehow magically reanimated. The Morgue that is Music Theory is no place for students, music lovers or the squeamish. It\u2019s like a place for studying birdsong by killing and dissecting birds. 6: Don\u2019t entomb yourself with Crypto-Maniacs in their graveyard! Therefore don\u2019t waste time learning to \u2018read\u2019 music aka Crypto. The Classical system is a form of cryptography that predates the modern piano by generations. The proper scientific name for that system is Classic Encrypt/Decrypt; a system ruled by vampires and hapless mummies. Crypto Piano methods create the most casualties among learners; have the absolute worst track record producing far more failures than successes. Cryptos reproduce and create the next generation of Cryptos by draining the musical life out of the majority of their student/dreamers. In general, when thirteen students start learning piano via Crypto there is but one survivor. 8: Don\u2019t play in Hell! Therefore stay the heck out of Spell-Hell, the subterranean land of the Chord Spelling, root obsessed trolls. Those DirtDevils will suck the life out of your desire to play and drag you through muddy playing. When fleeing the Crypto vampires and mummies many students wind up living in the hellish land of the chord spellers. Chord symbols are algebra equations that utilize an arcane arithmetic where 2+2=3. The Dirt Devils spelling freaks teach you how to solve those equations to find the subterranean aka \u2018root\u2019 spelling of a chord. Skilled players don\u2019t play that root spelling \u2018cuz at best it is nearly lifeless mud. T: Don\u2019t join the unliving during the zombie apocalypse. Cryptos, Spellers, the play-by-ear EerieHearies and any others who like, love or in any way worship the musical scale zombies are already learning methods that are dead in the water. At best, their outdated ideas are geared towards string or wind instruments and the now defunct ancestors of the modern piano. Like its ancestors, the modern piano is a percussion instrument; in the same family as drums and xylophones. Hammer strikes create the piano\u2019s sounds. All of them are white-key supremacists who come at learning piano from some state of unliving... suffering from their mass delusions that music is made from scale zombies and other lifeless stuff. All of them ignoring the most important of ALL piano facts\u2026 BLACK KEYS MATTER! ",
