            "answer_text": "You have to wait for the right moment and in some cases the moment can be less than perfect or hard to find, but there are ways to effect that.  That\u2019s a random picture from the internet that doesn\u2019t exactly illustrate my perfect scenario, but it encompasses some of the things I like when making the first kiss or several thousand kisses after that. First, I grew up near the beach and warm weather, so I really love the beach, it\u2019s a really romantic place for me but I like when there\u2019s water near by, I like when it\u2019s dark and intimate, meaning no distractions and it\u2019s personal, just one on one. I love the way light reflect off the water or the dim glow from distance lights or even candle light. So something you can control are things like going on a date that ends with a walk along the ocean or by the shore if there\u2019s a good place, it can also be though on just a really nice night out in the city where it\u2019s dark enough but still light and far away from people to be personal, like in a nice park or scenic area. You can also have a date at your house if you feel really comfortable with her and relaxed and she also feels comfortable and relaxed and trusts you, it\u2019s really important to read her body language, you don\u2019t want to be the guy that has to force women into intimacy and sex and they just do it to get it over with or because they freeze or don\u2019t know what else to do. That\u2019s why it takes time depending on the girl. I\u2019ve had sex and kisses on first dates, but I\u2019ve also had situations where things stretched into days and it took a lot of communication before she felt really comfortable with me to be intimate. So it\u2019s sort of like baking a cake, you want to have the right ingredients before just throwing it all together in the oven before you even mixed or opened the packaging of the ingredients. By the way, this is more my style, I am experienced and don\u2019t rush intimacy because I like the lead up to that just as much. And when that girl is starring at you and she is just smiling at you sort of blankly because she\u2019s nervous and wondering when you\u2019re going to make that move, you just wait until that place where you have that privacy, don\u2019t be afraid to look into her ears, brush the hair out of her face\u2026her eyes will be fixated on you, lean in, close your eyes and kiss her softly on her lips. Now, she might really be wanting you if you are doing things right, but you have to know and sort of guide the pace, never be in a rush, don\u2019t shove your hands in her pants or start touching her all over. Women like to be caressed and touched softly but at the same time be strong and do things with a confidence, feel her energy and tap into her breathing and body language. This is an abstract thing that can vary in many ways, I\u2019m sort of just giving you the \u201cperfect scenario\u201d. I think the first kiss can set the tone so it can be really worth waiting for the right moment, but I\u2019ve also been kissed first or just been on the dance door and there\u2019s a lot of sexual energy and it kind of just goes to that next level really quickly. You can also do something simple like have candles and music playing, talking and drinking a glass of wine or if you\u2019re young I guess some fruit punch or beer. It really depends on the situation, the girl, the age you are\u2026like I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s so girls don\u2019t want an immature guy, but if you\u2019re young women are doing all these things in their own head that they don\u2019t really know what to do or are just careless or who knows. But personally, I wait for the right moment, that privacy, I love the night time, lights, water, sort of setting the mood, but really, I don\u2019t intentionally plan these moments, you do have to let things just play out and sometimes you just have to make the move, sometimes that first kiss gets the ball rolling. My tips would be though for beginners: Make sure she\u2019s sort of ready for it and looking at youDon\u2019t go all crazy with the tongue and french kisses, kiss her lips and be sensual about itTry to do it in the right atmosphere or moodDon\u2019t be afraid to make the move if it just comes to you, it doesn\u2019t need to be night timeDon\u2019t make her wait too long for itDon\u2019t ask her if you can kiss her (that\u2019s my personal advice, I never do)Don\u2019t build it so much in your head that it becomes a barrier and you\u2019re just waiting and waiting for the perfect moment, you\u2019ve probably already missed it and at this point burning outHopefully, that is somewhat useful. I\u2019m not trying to make it complicated or have you make some extravagant plan, but I\u2019m just giving you ideas for opportunities or setups that are appropriate or make it easier for these moments to fall on your lap. First kisses are not always magical and at the right time, the important thing is you try and if it doesn\u2019t go well or as well as you liked don\u2019t dwell on it, just learn from it and keep trying, do not be a self conscious, overly hesitant guy because that will spoil the mood and don\u2019t be too aggressive either or you might a girl too uncomfortable but the important thing is you try and go for it.

            "answer_text": "Although you could do it crudely by barging in like an elephant and planting it, it's a lot better to lead up to it in stages of touching. It's known that human psychology accepts a sequence  (god, I hate to make this 'scientific' when it's about romance) that starts with casual social touch (between strangers, on the hands for example), then friendly touch (more than strangers but not intimate, on the arm), then romantic touch (for example, stroke her hair and observe the reaction), and if the reaction was favorable (you look in her eyes and she looks back expectantly), then you kiss her, gently.It's all about stages of acceptance.
