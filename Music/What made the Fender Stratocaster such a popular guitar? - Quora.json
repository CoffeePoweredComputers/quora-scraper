            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re reading this, hopefully you have time for a little history. If you just want to know the general answer to the question, scroll to the very last paragraph. Thanks!  Of course, all of the specs, features and details (that others have listed) of the Strat have to do with its popularity and ubiquity over the decades. However, these features merely underlie the important circumstances and unique set of variables that aligned during the 1950s to create what we now know as rock n roll and making the Stratocaster a wildly popular guitar platform. If you weren\u2019t alive back then (like me), try to consider what popular culture and the \u201cmusic scene\u201d would have been like in the 1940s and 1950s. Distorted guitar sounds that we now know so well only existed as offensive gear malfunctions or as underpowered amplifiers that were being pushed harder by their inputs than their schematics were meant to handle.   Before the early- mid 1900s, music was still being played in orchestral groups and bands as well as small ensembles of like instruments (eg. Mandolin orchestras). If you weren\u2019t aware, the company we know as Gibson Guitars was previously known as \u201cThe Gibson Mandolin and Guitar Company\u201d. Mandolin orchestras were hugely popular in the early 1900s. Acoustic instruments reigned supreme through the 1930s as electric guitars and amplifier technology (and audio tech in general) was still in its infancy.  Soon, instruments were being amplified. Gibson offered hollow-body electric guitars born from their deep roots as acoustic instrument makers. These instruments were constructed with glued in neck joints, arched tops and usually styling that tilted to much more classical designs of the past (spruce tops, flamed maple backs and sides, f holes, etc). Of course, Gibson was not the onlyinstrument manufacturer, just a popular one that is a good reference because people are familiar with the brand. Try to remember that by and large if the average person wanted to listen to music in the early part of the century, you had to seek out live performances or simply play it yourself on an instrument.  Perhaps even more significant and culture- altering than the Stratocaster was one of Mr. Fender\u2019s prior inventions, the Precision Bass. In the very early 1950s, Leo Fender and his crack team were creating something so groundbreaking that it changed popular music forever.  If you were a bass player before this time, you were likely relegated to the back of the stage with your \u201cdoghouse\u201d upright bass. If the rest of the band could hear your percussive attack, you were doing okay. If the audience could hear you at all in a medium to large sized ensemble, you were doing great.  Enter the Fender Precision Bass and Fender Bassman amplifier. The bass player in a band could now come forward and be not only heard, but felt as well. Heck, he could participate in vocal harmonies with larger bands, too. Soon, the percussionists and drummers found themselves playing louder and in some cases a bit faster to keep up with their string wielding, rhythm-section brethren. It\u2019s important to note that although these were not the very first instruments of their kind ever to be invented, they were indeed the first of their kind to be commercially viable and mass-produced.  In the first quarter of the year 1954, the Stratocaster was born. Fender\u2019s Broadcaster/Telecaster guitars had already proven commercially successful in the years since 1950, so it would only be natural to continue evolving the company\u2019s product offering. The Strat was the result of some deep, artist-involved research and development. With help from country swing artist, Bill Carson, Fender achieved features on the instrument that remain largely unchanged even in the company\u2019s current product offering. Arguably the most important being the body contours. There\u2019s one for your tummy and one for your picking hand forearm. It\u2019s an example of one-size-fits-all done perfectly right. To say the instrument was \u201cahead of its time\u201d would be a gross understatement. It was downright futuristic for the year 1954. I\u2019m not going to call-out every spec and feature. You can find that information all over the place. The bottom line is that all of these features and specs coalesced into a special concoction of a guitar that was beginning to allow players expressive and creative heights that were previously undiscovered. These tools of expression made it into the hands of enough musicians that a wave of popular music transition was building to a crescendo beneath. It crashed down on the world when artists like Bill Haley and His Comets, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly \u2018hit the scene\u2019. Acoustic Blues became electrified. R&B and swing music evolved along with gospel and jazz. The styles and their respective purists forever being altered by the ensuing changes that would result in the creation of the genesis of pretty much every piece of popular music since. All of a sudden, this new music style was everywhere. Rock n roll begin to engrain its influence in many aspects of popular culture, from fashion and movies to language and diction. Films like Rock Around The Clock surged in popularity in the US and the UK.  Fender was not the only contributing musical instrument maker to this movement, but was perhaps the most significant in that the company\u2019s (considerably more affordable) working class instruments and amplifiers were in the hands of so many musicians and on the planks, back- lining so many stages. It could be argued that Fender\u2019s company had the most significant impact on this movement due to the game-changing Precision Bass, launched just a few years before the Strat. Regardless of the points of argument, Fenders were more easily repaired and modified. Strat necks could be replaced by artists while on the road (as opposed to skilled instrument technicians). Unlike most electric guitars of the time, you could simply remove some screws from a plate and get to the electronics for servicing and repair. Repairing electronics in a hollow-body guitar can be like a ship-in-a bottle project. All of the specs and details of the instrument (and accompanying amplifiers), along with changes in culture and technology surrounding the music industry in the US in the 1950s enabled the Stratocaster to become an incredibly popular guitar. The general design and features of the Stratocaster guitar have remained largely unchanged to this day as it is still produced by the company which bears the Strat creator\u2019s name. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of things. It was easy to make. Leo Fender knew he had something with his routed body and bolt-on neck design for his Telecaster. Building a hollow-bodied guitar takes skill. Setting the neck angle is THE most expensive and critical process on a traditionally made guitar, and a badly set neck can ruin an entire guitar. By just routing out a single piece of wood for a body and bolting a neck onto the body with wood screws and a reinforcing plate, Fender turned a long, painstaking process done by skilled craftsmen into a simple and quick matter that could be done by anyone. And as long as the neck and body were routed correctly, the neck would attach quickly, easily, and at the right angle. This easing of manufacture costs allowed him to make guitars more quickly with less labor on each one and pass the savings on to the customer.It was easy to repair. Replacing a broken neck on a traditional guitar is a long and costly process, sometimes costing nearly as much as a whole new guitar. If the neck on a Fender guitar broke, a replacement neck could be bought and fitted within minutes, and again, with no special tools or skills necessary.It offered more features than its competitors. At the time, a premium guitar like a Gibson Les Paul had two pickups, as did guitars by Gretsch, Supro, Harmony, Rickenbacker, and especially Bigsby (whose shop in Downey, California, was nearby). Fender\u2019s Stratocaster offered three pickups, a vibrato bridge (called a \u201csynchronized tremolo\u201d to avoid patent trouble with Bigsby), two cutaways for better upper fret access and body contour cuts to make his guitar more comfortable to play. The Strat had been developed with input from professional players, and had many of the practical touches they asked for (like the aforementioned body contours and a volume knob positioned close to the strings so players could manipulate volume while still playing). This made the guitar more useful for all players. It gave the Stratocaster more tonal options, more functionality, and better ergonomics than anything else on the market at the time. Even today, the Stratocaster is still famed for its comfortable design, ease of playing and ability to work with any musical style and any guitarist\u2019s role in any band.Fender was already a successful maker of instruments and amplifiers. Leo Fender had been making electric guitars for four years by the time the Stratocaster came along, and making amplifiers for nearly ten. Fender\u2019s amplifiers were known to be roadworthy, compact, reliable, powerful, and sound good. The Telecaster had gained acceptance with Country artists, legendary Western Swing band Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys being the most visible proponents of the time. Fender\u2019s Precision bass, likewise, enabled basses to be much smaller, lighter, easier to pack and easier to play than ever before, and had gained traction in the marketplace with touring bands. Fender even had a line of steel guitars on offer. Their combined popularity paved the way for a wide system of distribution for the Stratocaster that, mere months after its introduction, would find its way into the hands of a young picker from Lubbock, Texas who was dissatisfied with the sound of his brand new Les Paul and wanted to trade it in for something twangier. That kid was Buddy Holley (his record company would change his name accidentally), and he would go on to become the first guitar hero to wield a Stratocaster, but not before he also walked out with a brand new Fender amp to go with his purchase.The Stratocaster was geared towards Country musicians, and Rock and Roll grew out of the Country Music scene. A true case of serendipity if ever there was one. Country music, especially the stuff played by up and coming acts from both Bakersfield and the Deep South, was loud, fast, twangy and played by people who were starting to turn their amps up loud. The Strat also made inroads in the Deep South\u2019s R&B scene, where energetic bands like Ike Turner\u2019s Kings of Rhythm (one of the earliest adopters of the Strat) were just beginning to make a dent on the charts. When the two music scenes exploded and merged to form Rock & Roll, both of them were playing Fender guitars. Leo Fender was in the right place, at the right time, with the right product when opportunity came calling.Hank Marvin played one. If you\u2019re from the UK, he needs no introduction. If you\u2019re not, he was the lead guitarist for both Cliff Richard and backing band The Shadows, and had long and productive careers with both. He was by far the most famous guitarist in all of British Music in the era that preceded the Beatles, and his impact on players in the British Rock scene was massive. Before Fender guitars were distributed in the UK, he got England\u2019s very first Stratocaster (privately imported), and inspired a whole generation of British players to pick up their own Fender guitars. Players like Keith Richards, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, John Lennon, Rory Gallagher, Ron Wood and others were all inspired to get their own Fender guitars in large part because Hank Marvin played his.Jimi Hendrix played one. This one isn\u2019t hard to understand. When someone uses your guitar to fundamentally change all of Rock music and is still regarded as one of the best guitar players of all time 50 years after his death, it\u2019s a big deal.Stevie Ray Vaughan played one. Likewise, when someone uses your guitar to resurrect an entire musical genre that had been considered dead, bring it back to the pop charts and national prominence, it\u2019s also a big deal. Stevie Ray Vaughan not only brought back Blues to the charts, he kept it there for a decade while selling millions of records and inspiring tens of thousands to pick up their own guitars and follow in his footsteps. Even today, nearly 30 years after his untimely death, if someone says they play Blues, they will usually cite Vaughan as a primary inspiration, and they will probably be playing a Stratocaster.It was relentlessly copied by everyone under the sun. The Stratocaster\u2019s design and construction was patented in 1954. When that patent expired in 1974, the whole design went into the public domain. Suddenly every instrument builder in the world had all of the the plans and specifications of the best-selling guitar in America, and could now clone it for free. And they did-dozens of instrument makers set about about copying its parts and putting their own guitars together for some quick cash, and the easy construction and assembly worked for the competition just as well as it had for Fender. Even rival guitar maker Gibson got in on the act, releasing their \u201cS-1\u201d guitar in mid-1974 that featured three Strat-like pickups, a 25\u20131/2 inch scale length, and a bolt-on neck, all very untraditional features for Gibson. By 1975, \u201cS-type\u201d guitars were coming in from overseas by the shipload, selling for small money, and quickly became every young player\u2019s first electric guitar. Some brands were good and made their reputation in America (like Ibanez), others were not and went under, but ALL of them made clones of the Strat. And even today, if you\u2019re a new brand of electric guitars and looking to make your mark in that world, you will offer an \u201cS-type\u201d guitar.I could go on and on about who played what, and technical advancements that were based on the Strat\u2019s design, but these are the biggest reasons.

            "answer_text": "The Strat was one of the very first electric MAINSTREAM, mass produced guitars on the market back in the very early 50s. As a result, it became very iconic. Of course, the other iconic guitar that came out of the 50s was the Les Paul. The Strat had three single coil PUPs and the Gibson had two dual-coil \u201cHumbuckers\u201d or P-90 PUPs. Both of these guitars\u2019 introductions were timed just perfect for the emergence of Rock & Roll. The Strat had a very futuristic George Jetson sort of design and this was all the rage in 1955. I grew up playing Gibsons. I had four of them and when I played any one of them, I could always feel the family resemblance in the way that they played. And they all played very well. Eventually, all those guitars became collectible and I sold them off before someone stole them. I went for a few years not playing professionally and then, in the mid-90s I hooked up with a blues band and realized I needed to shop for a new electric. I bought a new Strat and played it for like two decades. And I am here to tell you that the Strat is an entirely different animal from my old Gibsons. The first thing that one notices is that it does not wear your neck and shoulders out over a four hour gig. My Les Paul and my ES335 were HEAVY. OMG my poor aching shoulder! While Gibson Les Pauls have a three position switch for mixing the output of the PUPs, the Strat has a five position switch. With three single coils, those five switch positions give it an amazing variety of sounds. But a trained ear could always tell what guitars were being used on any given record by the sound. The Les Paul had a beefier, fatter sound while the Strat had a brighter, twangier sound. I like to call the sound, \u201cjangly.\u201d Until the two major guitar manufacturers expanded enough to offer other electric guitar designs, the Les and the Strat were really the only two main offerings in the very beginning and that\u2019s why the Stratocaster has become so popular.

            "answer_text": "Remember that the Stratocaster was not hugely popular when it was first introduced. For that matter, neither was the Gibson Les Paul. The Strat came out in 1954, as did the earliest rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but most of the early rock\u2019n\u2019roll guitarists played hollowbody Gibsons and Gretsches. Chuck Berry used a Gibson ES-350T, Scotty Moore used a Gibson ES-295, then a Gibson L-5CES, with Elvis Presley, and Bo Diddley used a Gretsch Jet Firebird. A few brave souls like James Burton played Fender Telecasters, but the first rocker to popularize the Strat was Buddy Holly, and I\u2019ve read accounts of people seeing Holly with his Strat and wondering if it was actually a guitar or some crazy stage prop. The Strat was not designed for rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2014the first Strat guys were Western Swing players in Southern California\u2014rock\u2019n\u2019roll didn't exist when the Strat was designed in the early \u201850\u2019s. It's a tribute to Leo Fender\u2019s (and Freddie Tavares\u2019s and Bill Carson\u2019s) ideas that the Strat has become an icon in so many styles of music. Leo was just trying to design a better vibrato than Paul Bigsby\u2019s\u2014he had no idea of what Jimi Hendrix would do with it. Leo did make the mistake of calling it a tremolo, which it's not. He also figured that everyone who\u2019d already bought Telecasters and Esquires would immediately trade them in on Stratocasters, and that didn't happen. ",

For example, a Strat played through an overdriven Marshall amp is a unique sound, and that uniqueness is so wonderful that it was an important part of Jimi Hendrix's sound. Jimi was one of the first players to get this sound with a Strat. In my experience, Strat pickups work better at loud volumes than Telecaster pickups because they are less microphonic and squealy; they just sound great. Players like Robin Trower and Stevie Ray Vaughan used the unique tones of a Strat into an overdriven tube amp to produce fantastic music. ",
