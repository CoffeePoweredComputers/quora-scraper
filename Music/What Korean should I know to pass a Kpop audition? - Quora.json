            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you mean the Korean language. The answer is you don\u2019t need to. It isn\u2019t necessary to be fluent in Korean if you\u2019re a foreigner. Of course, it is a plus but it isn\u2019t a need. There are idols out there who auditioned without knowing a single Korean word and yet they manage to debut. As long as you\u2019re talented/good-looking, you stand a chance to be a trainee. When you\u2019re a trainee, they will then teach you the language. ",
