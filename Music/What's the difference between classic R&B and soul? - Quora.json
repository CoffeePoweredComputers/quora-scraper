            "answer_text": "Soul music is a subset of classic R&B. R&B (rhythm & blues) encompasses pretty much all traditionally African-American secular music that is not jazz or hip-hop; that list includes soul music. Traditionally, \u201cclassic R&B\u201d is considered everything before about 1980 and everything thereafter is \u201ccontemporary R&B\u201d (the split indicated by Michael Jackson\u2019s 1969 album Off the Wall, which is considered to sit at the nexus point of disco, funk, classic R&B, and contemporary R&B) Soul music is a specific type of R&B that draws heavily on the gritty sounds of Black gospel music. Examples include Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin. Their more pop-polished contemporaries like Diana Ross & the Supremes are referred to as soul artists by some, but others have challenged that categorization. Classic R&B also includes doo wop, funk and disco, and classic R&B from the mid-1950s is considered to overlap with early rock and roll (in fact, \u201crock and roll\u201d was a term invented so that segregated radio stations could play R&B).
