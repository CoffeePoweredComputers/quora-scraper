I'm not implying that I think it's weird if music is a major part of your life. I like reading. But I understand that other people might not enjoy it. Everyone has their own thing. Reading isn't theirs. Music isn't mine.  But how could I possibly be a human and not enjoy music? Well, I do listen to a few songs. And I mean few. I listened to most of them for the first time three or four years back. I listen to music probably once in a month or two. And even when I do, it's the same old stuff. It's out of boredom. If I could do anything else, I probably wouldn't listen to them either. Listening to new music feels like a chore to me. Whenever someone recommends a new song, all it seems to me is like a task on my to-do-list and all I want to do is keep putting it off. Even if I do start playing the song, I don't get into it. I keep checking the time and waiting for it to get over. As Jonathan Stahl puts it, I simply just don't care. I don't hate music, but I don't particularly like it either. It's not like I can't stand it. I would be okay listening to it during social gatherings or performances by friends/school mates. But would I want to listen to in my free time? No. ",

However, to me, they all make sense. J.S. Bach or PDQ Bach, it's all interesting because I understand it. My guess is that people who don't like music or certain kinds of music, don't have the mental framework to be able to convert it from noise to music. Just as a totally foreign language can sound like noise, particularly one with no cognates to ones native tongue. (Dineh or Basque, for example.) It's all just a jumble of sounds with no reference to make heads or tails of it. But then on the other hand, I don't get most visual art. Jackson Pollak, Picasso, Mondrian and so on make me scratch my head in total confusion. Even more \u2018accessible\u2019 artists like Monet don't really float my boat. They're ok, but not something I really want on my wall. I don't have the framework for most visual arts, it not really being something I've had all that much interest in. People talk about how abstract art makes them feel and all I can do is smile and nod and hope there isn't a quiz later because I know I'd flunk what all those colors are supposed to mean.

            "answer_text": "I am a music addict and I think there a lot of things that go through my mind when I am listening to music. They keep flashing up in my mind and sometimes change the way how I feel the music. Some songs change things instantly. The way people hear music is very subjective. It varies vastly. For a musician, it may lead to a understanding of the various dynamics of the song like the expressions (softness, loudness, changes..etc), the tempo, the mood (of course, they enjoy the song too) and so on and so forth. For some other people It can be a resonating experience, it can change they mood instantly, it can make them laugh or smile or cry. But music is not all that can create this. People have their own way finding things. For example, some may find reading or writing or talking or painting to be must more exhilarating than music. It is a matter of perception. I've known people who don't listen to the music of a song but pay interest to the lyrics a lot more. It is not that they cannot enjoy music or have no ability to. It is just that what they feel is completely different. Recently I saw this TED talk that changed the way I thought. (The transformative power of classical music) It goes on to say that everyone can enjoy music and everybody has an ability to do so too (so, no problem with them that). But I guess, It depends on enjoyment. We tend to do things what we love to do. People may have something else where their heart lies in and music could be just another thing for them (like how writing or reading is for another). If one insists someone who does not read much to read a lot, he might find it a disturbance too. People have their own things and you have to go live with that. Maybe you could ask one other what they like and convert it into a day of more fun. ",

To someone like myself who is a musician, it is a foreign thing to meet someone like that, and I don't know how anyone could not like music. I mean, with all the types of music out there, you'd think everyone could find something they like, but well, there are people who really are apathetic about it.  But I suppose they feel the same way about music that I feel about, say, sports. Left to my own devices, I could care less about sports. I don't go out of my way to track it or to follow teams or to play on any teams. I admire excellence in athletics, but I don't possess any fascination with it and can go through sports seasons without really caring much about teams or any of that. But people who are athletic or are sports lovers, they live and breathe it, and cannot imagine what it is like to be indifferent to it. ",

I also agree with  Ed Averbukh's assertion that there is social pressure to pretend you like music as some sort of fashion statement. The fact that most people have an I-pod nowadays and seem to enjoy music probably contributes to your surprise at their being some who don't. I think those are just the honest members of a much larger group. Before mp3 players, most people I knew didn't have music, they simply weren't interested enough to bother with it. Once I-pods started becoming prevalent, I think listening to music became an activity that has far more to do with cultural identity than actual music. ",

As hard (even sad, based on how much joy music has brought into my life) as it is to believe, some people suffer from a disorder recently termed 'Congenital Amusia' (CA) and are physically incapable derive pleasure from music.  Those  with CA fail to recognize common tunes from their culture, do not hear when notes are  'out of tune' and sometimes report that music sounds like a 'dinging' or  'banging'.  The core deficit appears to be a problem in discriminating  pitch direction, a building block for the representation of melodic  contour. Familial studies suggest the disorder is heritable and  associated with structural differences in temporal and frontal cortices.  The disorder provides a window onto the neuro-cognitive architecture of  musical processing, and the possible etiologies of disordered  development. I do not recall the source, but I recall reading that this could effect up to 5% of the population. ",

Some people are color blind, some don't have sense of smell, I am accepting everyone.But there are two annoying variants of these. The first variant are people who fake their love for music. There is a social pressure, especially for young males, to understand music, so some fake it. When they talk about music they may know many facts, but you can feel that there is no passion behind their knowledge.The second variant are those who are sure that everyone is faking their love for music. These are usually older individuals, maybe they belonged to the first variant when they were young. They refuse to admit their handicap and prefer to think that love of music is a global scam aimed at the younger generation. For me it is difficult to deal with these cause you cannot prove that seeing is real to someone who was born blind. ",

Instead, when not working or downloading music i avoid any kind of noise and music. Not because i dont like it. Well theres many genres of music i don like. But it has to do that listening to music makes me incapable to do anything else as my attention goes to every single sound. Even worse if i dont like the genre it gets me really stressed. If i like it i just flip and go into another world. So i cant concentrate on what i am doing. It is only good to have music if i am exercising. As for me music has to give me energy. All the music i dont like is the romantic or melanconic. Hope it makes sense! ",

For example,it\u00b4s  not that i don\u00b4t like food, of course i eat and can appreciate a good dinner, but in anyway i\u00b4m a foodie, i don\u00b4t consider important to invest my time on such things, so if i\u00b4m on the road I\u00b4ll be perfectly happy eating a sandwich or almost anything, but for some people that\u00b4s unacceptable, they have to stop and eat in a \"good\" restaurant, preferably with wine.
