            "answer_text": "Most fans didn't have an issue with it even while some stans may not find the original version that appealing. Some stans dont like even the original song,maybe cuz it's not their cup of tea ,maybe cuz they feel its played out too much and got annoying after tiktok. But overall the remix was well recieved. The part that shook ppl in a pleasant way was jk saying the word f*ck in the prettiest way ever. I didnt like the original song cuz it did annoy me due to trends, but it wasn't a bad song on it's own. Yet in the remix ,we have JK's sweeter voice starting the song intro and it was kinda addicting and pleasing and then jason with his sweet but fuller voice also sounded nice and then the rap, overall the remix was more addicting to listen too and had a different feel to it. And I'm not saying the remix is better just cuz its bts who was featured but I just genuinely feel like the remix was nicely done and the blend of Jason and jk's vocals was appealing. I also think jk's sweeter tone was more addicting to take in and then have jason follow in and then the light yet fun rap. Many fans liked the remix, even if many grew tired of how tiktok played it so much, they remix was very well complimented ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly I don\u2019t get the hype. I guess because the song isn\u2019t my cup of tea. But I sensed the song is meant to promote Jungkook to American market, eventho there are Suga rapping part. It is clearly highlighting Jungkook\u2019s vocal and english pronounciation skill\u2026which he nailed it by the way. It\u2019s not easy to sing that kind of song (I don\u2019t know the genre), but he proved himself that he\u2019s capable to sing to various genre. The way he sing english on that song is fit very well, right? ",
