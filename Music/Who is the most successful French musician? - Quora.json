            "answer_text": "Serge Gainsbourg (1928 - 1991)  Gainsbourg exemplified the French spirit better than essentially every other artists that came before him or afterwards. the son of Ukrainian jews, Gainsbourg was born and raised in paris and only narrowly escaped deportation and a certain death during WWII.    Later on, he pursued art studies in the hopes of becoming a painter. Ultimately, he gave up on that and started writing songs, first for others and then under his own name.  While other French musicians have been more commercially successful or managed to become to players in more niche musical markets, Gainsbourg accomplished the unthinkable: being both a popular fixture of French cultural life for nearly 30 years and an actual, talented musician.  Songs like Le Poinconeur de Lillas  La Javanaise  or Couleur Caf\u00e9  Are still very well know by many Frenchmen, and those are only some of his early hits, written at the very beginning of his career more than  half a century ago.   Originally playing rather quiet \u00b4chanson\u00b4-style songs marked by ironic and witty lyrics, Gainsbourg ended up writing and recording in a variety or genre such as  Baroque Pop:  Blues-Rock  New Wave  synth-Funk  and even Reggae-Dub:  This last song is actually a remake of the French  national anthem, La Marseillaise, recorded with the backing band of Bob Marley. He made huge waves when he released this song.  In addition to his music, Gainsbourg was a true \u00b4Star\u00b4 and often made headlines for non-music-related reasons.  He was a heavy drinker, chain-smoker and overall very much filled the stereotype of the somewhat extravagant Frenchman oscillating between being plain odd and classy in a snap of a finger.  His liaisons with famous actresses and beauty-icons Brigite Bardot and Jane Birkin also made him quite the talk of the town in those days.   Finally, and maybe most relevant here, he is one of the few French musician to have managed to become both popular in France and abroad. Albums such as Initiales BB , L\u00b4Histoire de Melody nelson or L'homme a la tete de choux (http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/serge_gainsbourg ) are pretty popular among fans of singular oldies and beyond. In addition, he is regularly mentioned, sampled, covered and otherwise hailed by prominent artists, both in France and abroad (Serge Gainsbourg ). He is, and will remain one of the most influential French musical of all time, and for very good reasons!  Hope this helped !  ",

            "answer_text": "Classical French Musicians Charles Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns: Parisian-born Charles Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebnswas a famous French composer, organist and pianist. Composing and playing during the tumultuous latter half of the 19th century, Saint-Saens achieved fame mainly for his compositions. His most famous works include Danse Macabre, Sampson and Delilah, and the Carnival of the Animals, a work frequently used to introduce children to classical music.Maurice Ravel: Play the opening notes of Bolero, and almost everyone can begin tapping out the rhythm made famous by Bo Derek in the movie \"10\". But the work was originally composed by Maurice Ravel, a famous French musician known for his impressionistic style and compositions for the dance. Ravel's style was heavily influenced by the impressionist movement, and by the works of fellow French musician and composer, Claude Debussy. Ravel wrote numerous works for orchestra, the ballet, and piano. Claude Debussy: Pianist and composer Claude Debussy's beloved works include La Mer (The Sea) and many compositions for piano. His work was heavily influenced by cross-cultural music, including Javanese music. He experimented with many musical scales to create lush tone poems that evoked moods more clearly than anything that had come before him. Debussy influenced other French musicians of the time, including Ravel, and is much loved as a great Classical French musician and composer. Modern French Musicians Popular French musicians today include groups such as the Gipsy Kings and Daft Punk, jazz violinist Stephane Grapelli, and singer/actors Yves Montand and Vanessa Paradis. The Gipsy Kings gained worldwide fame through their unique blend of flamenco and rumba music. Infused with the sounds of the Catalonia and the coastal regions of France, their music combines the best dance rhythms. Rumba, flamenco, salsa and other beats fuel their addictive sound.Daft Punk creates French 'house' style music. The group consists of two men, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Cristo and Thomas Bangalter. They're especially noted for great music videos with creative and original effects. Their skills in electronic music may be unparalleled. Listen to samples of their music at Last.Beloved by jazz aficionados worldwide, Stephane Grapelli's astounding virtuoso violin work, whether accompanied by other strings or on its own, provides brilliant jazz sound. His 1997 Grammy win came right before the artist's death and many thought it was long overdue. He played in many jazz bands, and his strong style is unmistakable.France has a number of actors who are also musicians. During much of the 20th century, singer and actor Yves Montand entertained millions with his easy-listening style recordings and handsome movie star looks on the big screen. He often played the role of a working class man who triumphs over evil. Today, actor Vanessa Paradis occupies a similar spot in popular culture. Like America's Britney Spears, Paradis demonstrated precocious talent, becoming internationally famous at age 14 for her song, \"Joe le Taxi\". Paradis lives with actor Johnny Depp and their two children in Paris.",
