            "answer_text": "It's so funny to see this question because it is obviously the other way round! BTS was styled and marketed around BigBang one of the biggest K-Pop act from South Korea. I'm one of the first generation K-Pop fan; initial people who were front runner of Hallyu wave when Korean dramas and music became very big in the Eastern belt of the world... I'm also part of the second generation K-Pop fan when KPop started getting momentum in Europe, especially Latin America and some parts of USA... I am also part of the 3rd generation when KPop became more global and more accepted in USA... So in short I observed the transition\u2026 Big Hit was a small company and BTS till recently was a small group. YGE was already dominant in the world music market and they already were global with 2NE1 and Big Bang with good success rate. They tried with Big Bang's predecessor SE7EN without much success but during that time, early 20s Rain/Bi from JYPE was already making waves in the western market. He was even the lead of Hollywood film Ninja Assassin... Before them SME with TVXQ dominated Asian market... It was JYPE who dared to venture to the western market with Rain with some success. YGE with SE7EN was not so successful in the West but they have massive western audience pulled in for Big Bang and 2NE1. Big Bang was quite unique for Korean market and had some western elements in it. They were the only group marketed widely for their talents and unique individuality. The members didn't dress alike unlike other existing groups that time. They looked quite individualistically different from one another and other KPop acts too. They were modelled after their senior 1TYM but unlike 1TYM, Big Bang were the actual global KPop hit. Because of them YGE rose to prominence and made lots of money. They also influenced other KPop group to have individuality which wasn't so common before them. So in short NO YGE is not copying Big Hit... It's the other way round and there is nothing wrong in it. Every artist influence one another. Every company takes pages from other company for success and growth. Black Pink is just imbibing the current Korean trend of beauty with talents. YGE already have good connections worldwide to promote them. Big Hit was a small company and thanks to western new KPop fans BTS has become huge and now because of BTS, the company got popularity, money and power like how Big Big did for YGE. They studied YGE's strategy and got success. Also thanks to numerous other groups, not just from YGE when Western fans started noticing KPop. BTS happens to be at the right time and place and right formula for success. New growing KPop fans started noticing them as they stood out from the other KPop act because at that time Big Bang was lying dormant. Most of BTS's music, looks, dressing, marketing styles are taken from Big Bang and made their own. The formula which was already used by YGE for Big Bang and 2NE1 was uses by Big Hit for BTS... ",
