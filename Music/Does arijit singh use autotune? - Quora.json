            "answer_text": "No,Arijit doesn't, the music directors Arijit sings for do. I can very well sense that if there is a slightest thought of undermining the singing capabilities of Arijit by acknowledging the fact of using autotune in his songs, then that would definitely satisfy you mentally but the intention is never going to be fulfilled. But if it's a general question but for any mal-intentions, then I would say, \u201c do enjoy his music, forget about autotune\u201d. If someone understands auto tuning then he/she would definitely acknowledge it strongly that \u201cAutotune can't make a bad singer sound good, it justs corrects the minor glitches to make the pitch perfect\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Well, YES, he uses it, he had admitted that in an interview. (  ) But first, be cleared anoutv what an autotune is. It is just used whenever you go out of tune, just to go perfect in the vocal part, for some pitch correcions or so. It's not in the singer's hand but done by the recording or mixing engineer. It gives some kind of robotic quality to the track that most of us listeners perceive it as pro sounding. ",
