            "answer_text": " Science is humans trying to understand the world. Music is humans trying to understand each other. I think it comes down to the fact that music is designed to be memorable. A musician will create dozens and dozens of tracks and will only work the demos they perceive to be the catchiest or the ones which are the most enjoyable. So I imagine there is an element of survivor bias of which songs get released. On top of that unless you trawl the internet or go out of your way to find really obscure music you are gonna be listening to music that other people already consider memorable. Science is pretty boring because for most people it is just not interesting. Interesting means something that is able to break your weak intuition. So if you can\u2019t build up a strong intuition for science you will never find it interesting. Science is also full of a lot of volume, especially subjects like biology where it is hard to go through the material enough to gain the proper understanding. ",

You can't remember \u201cthe stuff\u201d for your science test because you're vapid and not interested in science or nature. If you were actually interested in hard science, then it's really not that hard to learn or understand. Physics is mostly math though. Soft sciences like political science and anthropology and psychology are only nominally science, because arbitrary categories and opinions aren't scientific, and they utilize almost no scientific knowledge or methodology.
