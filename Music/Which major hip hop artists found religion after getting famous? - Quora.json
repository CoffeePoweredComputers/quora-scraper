            "answer_text": "I can think of a handful of rappers who converted to Islam during their professional careers.  Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest read the Koran around 1990, the same year that the band debuted with the album People\u2019s Instinctive Travels. He then converted to Islam. He previously identified as agnostic. He changed his legal name from Jonathan Davis to Kamaal Ibn John Fareed. He often references his religion and conversion in his music. His second solo album was titled Kamaal the Abstract.   The late, great Sean Price converted to Islam in Amsterdam in 2009. There was a slight irony to this considering that his previous album, released in 2007, was called Jesus Price Supastar.   Most people know of the Beatnuts as a duo (Psycho Les and JuJu), but if you look back at their first two albums, they were originally a trio. The third member was Fashion.  Fashion became a devout Muslim, so he left the band (amicably) and embarked on a solo career. He changed his name to Al Tariq. His debut solo album was called God Connections.   Scarface was raised Christian, but converted to Islam in 2006. That he found a new religion is not a huge surprise. Dating back to his time in Geto Boys in the \u201880s, his music has always dealt with the struggles of balancing the sins of street life with the desire to be pure in the eyes of God. ",
