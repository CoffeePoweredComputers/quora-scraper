It is considered by many to be the best solo album released by any of The Beatles! The song \u201cWorking Class Hero\" features two clearly sung \u201cF-bombs\" and \u201cI Found Out\" has the line \u201cI see you sitting there with your c**k in your hand\u2026\u201d! Pretty raw stuff for 1970! Being an 8 year old Beatles fan at the time, I begged my mom to buy it for me at the \u201cTG&Y\" store (anybody remember those?). Imagine my parents surprise when they heard those songs coming from my room! They took the album away from me but it didn't really matter anyway because at 8 I didn't understand the anger and raw honesty of the album. Of course by my late teens I realized it was a brilliant album and still do! ",
