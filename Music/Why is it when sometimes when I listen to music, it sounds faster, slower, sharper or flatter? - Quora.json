            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probably your brain and/or auditory system. Pitch is determined in the ears, but certain situations can alter the perceived pitch. Louder sounds seem flatter even if they are at the exact same pitch. Also if your ears are tired, this can affect your subjective perception of pitch, but also timbre (you lose sensitivity to high frequencies more rapidly than to low ones, something any audio engineer knows too well). Tempo, on the other hand, is determined in the brain. If your internal clock is running a bit faster, the music will seem to be just the opposite (slower), but without affecting the pitch. If your internal clock has slowed down, the music will seem faster, again without affecting the pitch. ",

In high school I was with a buddy at the drive-in movies and Hank Williams Jr. began to sing. Bob, why does he sing so flat or off-key? Ken, that\u2019s his style of singing, and right then I knew I\u2019d never be a C&W fan I\u2019m still not except for a couple of female of singers with beautiful voices. We know how it\u2019s put together and how it\u2019s supposed to sound; artwork we are able to hear and enjoy. ",
