            "answer_text": "Just start! You can either start with the groove (beat) of the track or the rhythm (chord structure). Once you've finished the music, you'll be needing the help of an audio engineer who will mix the track, and then finally master it to make it upload-ready. Note that mixing is something that cannot be learnt overnight. It requires experience, knowledge and good ears. Hence it's advised that once your music is complete, always hire a mix engineer for the finalisation of the track since he/she would know the technical glitches and the capability to fix them. Hope it helped you! ",
