He has released the music video for it today which features young actor Jacob Tremblay playing a younger version of the singer. Here's the lyrics for it: [Verse 1]Everybody knows my name nowBut something 'bout it still feels strangeLike looking in the mirrorTryna steady yourself and seeing somebody elseAnd everything is not the same nowIt feels like all our lives have changedMaybe when I'm older, it'll all calm downBut it's killing me now [Pre-Chorus]What if you had it all but nobody to call?Maybe then you'd know me'Cause I've had everythingBut no one's listeningAnd that's just fucking lonely [Chorus]I'm so lo-o-o-onelyLo-o-o-onely [Verse 2]Everybody knows my past nowLike my house was always made of glassAnd maybe that's the price you payFor the money and fame at an early ageAnd everybody saw me sickAnd it felt like no one gave a shitThey criticized the things I didAs an idiot kid [Pre-Chorus]What if you had it all but nobody to call?Maybe then you'd know me'Cause I've had everythingBut no one's listeningAnd that's just fucking lonely [Chorus]I'm so lo-o-o-onelyLo-o-o-onelyI'm so lo-o-o-onelyLo-o-o-onely Lyrics Credit: http://genuis.com Ps: for more music related update please checkout bloggistan website ",
