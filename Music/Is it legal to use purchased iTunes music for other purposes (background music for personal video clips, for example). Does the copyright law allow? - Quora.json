            "answer_text": "Technically, you don't purchase music from iTunes, you purchase a license for the music. The license permits you obtain a digital copy of the music and play it back on devices connected to your iTunes account. You aren't licensed to make derivative works of the music, redistribute the music, incorporate them into movie clips, etc. To do so would be infringing and carry the associated penalties (statutory $150,000 fine, damages, possible jail time). That said, there are two other considerations: first is that truly personal uses are not likely to result in an infringement claim if there's no redistribution because the cost of prosecution is not worth it; second is that US law allows an accused infringer to assert fair use under some specific circumstances: the work was used in a situation where it was the subject of critical review or comment, it was used in part or in summary in a news report, it was used for a non-profit educational use, or it is used in a parody (a work that  satirizes or ridicules another). A court will determine whether a particular use seems like a \"fair use\" to the court (and sometimes they will accept certain uses that aren't specifically cited in the law). Generally speaking, you should restrict yourself to using music that is permissively licensed (Creative Commons or public-domain) wherever possible. Otherwise, license the music from the label properly for reuse. ",
