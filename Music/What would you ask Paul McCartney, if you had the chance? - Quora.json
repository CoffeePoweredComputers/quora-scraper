I don't buy it.-if he suffers from tinnitus from all the decades of touring.-what is the deal with the gunshot sounds on Ram.-if he plays Beatles Rockband with Beatrice.-what is the most mundane chore he still performs by himself, no matter how wealthy he's become.-why he's written so many songs in A, eventhough he's had a quite wide vocal range, and if he has conciously switched to other chords now that his voice isn't as healthy as it used to be.-in what format/device he listens to the Beatles music and what is the album he listens most.-what is the best sounding Beatles concert he has in his personal collection-what is the prefered Beatles concert he has in his personal collection, regardless of quality, and why.-if he has any funny stories about sneaking around either in costume or late at night to try to feel normal again, if only for a few minutes.-what is his main regret in life.-what is his main achievement in life, outside the Beatles/Wings.-if, apart from his Alpico blue amp, he has any kind of EMI tech thingy from way back when, even predating his mellotron.-what's his own favourite song and discuss that at length. and hoping that he's become warm and open at this point... -what did he say to John and George the last time he saw them. The REAL speeches, not the ones trimmed and rehearsed for the media. I'd try to stay clear of the usual questions. ",
