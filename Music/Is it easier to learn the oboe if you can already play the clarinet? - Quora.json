            "answer_text": "It all depends on the kid, quite frankly. When I was in HS and playing in youth orchestras, I sat next to kids who had started on clarinet in 4th grade and switched to oboe in 7th. They learned the basics of reading music, covering holes with their fingers, and blowing air on the clarinet rather than the oboe. Their playing was comparable to mine. When I was in 4th grade and looking to follow after older siblings and join the band, my parents told me that when the \u201cman\u201d came around recruiting, I was to tell him I wanted to play the oboe, and to not let him tell me I needed to start on clarinet first. Both my parents had music ed degrees and I think they didn\u2019t see any reason not to start on the chosen instrument. So, I started on the oboe and just blew my little brains out while learning all the same things my future peers were learning on clarinet. Now-a-days, a lot of band programs refuse to allow students to begin on either of the double reeds, oboe or bassoon, or horn. IMHO, the only reason they should do this is for financial reasons. The instruments are expensive, often not available through rental, and the school may not own their own. In addition, an oboe reed is considerably more expensive than a clarinet reed, and kids can go through them quickly. Any other reason other than financial (and this will tick off some of my colleagues) amounts to laziness on the part of the music teacher, IMHO. Pure and simple: they don\u2019t want to deal with the instruments they don\u2019t know very well. Unfortunately, more and more high school bands don\u2019t seem to have many, if any, double reed and horn players. Hmmm . . . To answer your question more directly, no one can really tell you because no current oboe player could have had both experiences with which to make a comparison. Perhaps a long-experienced music teacher could make a legitimate observation, one way or the other. As for all my peers I played with in various community and youth orchestras throughout HS who started on clarinet and were comparable oboists to me? Comparable\u2014yes, but I was first chair. ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, some of the skills would transfer, such as controlling your breath, holding a similar size instrument, learning to finger an instrument that is somewhat similar. The fingerings would be different. You\u2019d have to learn how to play the notes from scratch. The reed and what you do with your mouth are very different. The task of learning an instrument is generally similar. Having done it already, it would be easier the second time. You can already read music. So there are some similarities, but there are also important differences. ",
