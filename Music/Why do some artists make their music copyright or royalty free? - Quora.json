            "answer_text": "An excellent question, and one that leaves me scratching my head most days. Recorded music is one of the very few industries/ mediums where the perceived value has become nothing, even though there is still a cost in creation, the time involved, etc. Ask any other industry or product manufacturer or service provider to do business this way\u2026 they will laugh and tell you you\u2019re crazy. Most artists have decided to use their music as a \u201cbusiness card,\u201d rather than a viable product, to get music-lovers to shows and to buy other merchandise. This may be great for the artists who are large enough to command such a thing, but it still gravely affects the songwriter, who doesn\u2019t have the same opportunity of gracing a stage. What a tangled web we\u2019ve woven\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Artists make their music royalty free for several reasons, but first let\u2019s clarify this concept: \u00abroyalty free music \u00bb doesn\u2019t mean \u00ab free music \u00bb, it simply means that the user can buy a license one time for a particular project, and won\u2019t have to paye royalties each time his project is performed.. In the other hand \u00ab Copyright free \u00bb is a false sentence because by international laws any creative work is automaticaly copyrighted to its creator and the creator needs nothing to do to activate this copyright. So when one read in some websites or Youtube channels : \u00ab music free of copyright \u00bb or \u00ab non copyrighted music \u00bb this is a non sense. Arists make their music \u00ab royalty free \u00bb because this way they can manage their rights them self, they can decide in witch case their music can be used for free and they can decide for the prices in the case of commercial use. When we are an indie artist it\u2019s a very bad idea to let a PRO manage your ringht unless your music is broadcasted in a famous TV show or in a hollywood movie. ",
