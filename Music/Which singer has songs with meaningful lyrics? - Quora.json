            "answer_text": "There are a few different artists that I think have meaningful lyrics: Lorde I really like her music because they change and evolve with age. You can tell from the difference between \u2018Pure Heroine' and the songs that have been released from \u2018Melodrama\u2019 that she has been through a lot. My favorite songs from her are \u2018Buzzcut Season\u2019, \u2018Sober\u2019, and \u2018Liability\u2019. She does an amazing job writing lyrics, and you can tell they were thought through.  Icon For Hire This is a band that my sister likes. The singer, Ariel Bloomer, has gone through depression and she has anxiety. We went to one of her concerts and it took her a while to come onstage because she could hear the crowd from the green room. Anyways, she has some very well-written songs, like \u2018Happy Hurts' and \u2018Get Well\u2019. I wasn't a fan of them at first, but their music is actually pretty good.  THE ORAL CIGARETTES THE ORAL CIGARETTES is my favorite. They are a Japanese rock band from the Nara Prefecture. A good amount of their music is love/breakup songs, but they aren't the bland, generic, Taylor Swift and Justin Beiber kind. Some of my favorites include \u2018Amy\u2019, \u2018Tonari Au', and \u2018ONE\u2019S AGAIN'. I'm not sure how much of their songs have English subtitles, since I haven't looked for them myself (I'm learning Japanese, so I wanted to see how much I could pick up). Feel free to ask me for a link to the songs I have translated, but I definitely can't guarantee their accuracy. :-)  ",

            "answer_text": "So I have two artists you should listen to. The first one goes by Watsky and the second one Yungblud. Before you click away thinking these are rappers who only sing about bullshit let me explain. Okay, so Watsky started out as a slam poet in San Francisco. He won the title of 'Brave New Voices International Poetry Slam Champion'. As his work got more and more recognition, he turned to hip hop/rap. But it's not the kind you're thinking, I have never heard a song with as much meaning as his. My personal favorite is 'tears to diamonds'. It's totally worth the listen. Here he is~  My next artist is Yungblud, he's not as poetic but his lyrics do have meaning. He's all about the younger generations and how we're not credited enough for our goals for the future. Now, Yungblud is classified as British punk, but if that's not your thing, he has unplugged versions of most of his songs, these are played solely on acoustic. I personally love the song 'Polygraph Eyes', it sounds great as an unplugged version. 'Medication' is also really good, just listen to his album before judging. Here he is-   Let me know how you like them. I swear they're both amazing. If you're looking for meaningful that's like \"boom this is meaningful!\" Go for Watsky. On the other hand if your looking for \"oh my god that song was awesome, wait a second, that was deeeeep\" go for Yungblud. Just give them both a listen. ",
