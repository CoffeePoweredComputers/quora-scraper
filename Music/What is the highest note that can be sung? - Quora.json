            "answer_text": "A classically trained soprano can sing up to an F6 (~1400 Hz), but it would come out a bit like a squeak, and probably wouldn\u2019t be held very long. The highest note ever whistled comes from Joshua Lockard, who recorded a whistle at ~10,599 Hz. However, every note is the sum of all of the harmonica that resonate in sequence above the focus pitch. If you were to play a C below Middle C (C3) on a piano, you would get the resonance of- The focus note, or what\u2019s called Harmonic 1- C3 (130.81 Hz) Harmonic 2- C4 (261.62 Hz) or Middle C Harmonic 3- G4 (392.43 Hz) Harmonic 4- C5 (523.24 Hz) Harmonic 5- E5 (654.05 Hz) The point is, every time you play (or sing) a note, you trigger that notes harmonics (also called overtones). So hypothetically, applying the same harmonic distances as with C3, that soprano who squeaked out an F6 produced a harmonic roughly equivalent to A7 (~3587.8 Hz) ",
