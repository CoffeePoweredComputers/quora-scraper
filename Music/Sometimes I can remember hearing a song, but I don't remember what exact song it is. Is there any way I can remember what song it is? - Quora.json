            "answer_text": "Probably not. I recall hearing a song in 1972 I liked. It was an up-and-coming hit in the UK, but I never knew what it was called. Circumstances changed and I forgot all about it. Later I remembered about the song, but could not remember the song itself. I looked at lists of the charts of the time to see if anything jogged my memory, but no. I\u2019ve even tried playing songs that could have been it, but I don\u2019t otherwise know, to see if there\u2019s some sort of deep memory that would bubble to the surface when triggered. Nope. I have no idea what it was. I remember where I was and what I was doing at the time, I recall lots of other stuff going on at the time, but I just cannot remember the song. This is rare for me, I have a pretty reliable memory for songs otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "Go to the place you were. Look at the object you were looking at when you heard the songs. Re-experience the smells and tastes of that day. You then hunt down the playlists of each genre and year. I like Spotify playlists for the same reason we like this website; Humans actually answer Questions and build playlists. If you can, sing it to someone, even if it's just melody. As goofy as it sounded without me knowing the words, I sang Mercy, by Kanye West. It sounded ridiculous because I didn't know the words. It's worth it. Happy hunting! ",
