            "answer_text": "Once you've registered with a performing rights organization (BMI, SESAC, or ASCAP) or just beforehand, reach out to a regional rep at one of them & set up a meeting to come say hi and play for them - literally in their office. They have budgets to put you in front of other industry types which you can do the exact same thing with. It's such a great old school tactic that NO one does any longer, like driving to the radio station to play for them & hand them your record, and because of that it 'can' work miracles. Being tactful and polite of course matter, and so does having a style of music that they would be receptive to, so do your homework and simply ask who some of their favorite current artists are (or \"what is in heavy rotation\" at their radio station). Also, if you hire a publicity firm, or radio promoter, or connect with an agent who likes what you do, simply ask them what events would suit your style and if they have any slots to play (once you've hired them-hint). - not a plug necessarily, just true, and how things tend to work. Most importantly, ask questions, and don't be a afraid to put yourself out there. People respect confidence & will try a little harder to get you in front of the right people if they are not into your material themselves. Think about it; if you get an email from someone and have no interest in what they are offering, are you going to try and find them someone who does, or are you going to do that for the person who walks into your office and asks for the pointers..? - Nelson Wells, Publicity firm Team Clermont, Athens, Georgia ",
