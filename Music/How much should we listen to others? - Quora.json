            "answer_text": "Listening is a great skill. Let us ignore for a moment, about the people who simply waste your time by discussing non-sense. Before the advent of printing, information was passed through generations by stories i.e. vocally. So we can safely assume our brains to some extent are wired to understand things by listening in a better way. It may be the reason, why we generally understand well when explained by other people through audio/video instead of reading. However, the ability to understand through listening is not as easy as it may seem. It should be honed and perfected.  Now coming to our question, How much should I listen to others? Well, it mainly depends on the person with whom you are communicating. If you feel they are genuinely interested in sharing their knowledge, then you should listen to them.  However, there may be a point when you find the discussion is not helping much, then it is OK to point it out politely. There is no good in wasting time when you can avoid it. But remember, you may lose an important advice if you do not listen to someone. Our very own collective intelligence is built on this fact, i.e. passing information from generation to generation. This will help you to avoid mistakes done by someone. Yes, there are people who simply waste your time either to dominate you or simply cannot help doing so. It is not rude to leave such conversations, time is very valuable. Finally, it is up to you whether to listen to someone or not. But choose it wisely, you never know who is hiding a gem in their sleeves. Irfan ",

            "answer_text": "People always try to help where they can and most of the time its about them voicing their opinion rather than truly understanding the whole situation.Only once in a while someone fairly neutral comes along and gives you better insight or a different perspective (if you're open to it) rather than bombarding you with information. Also, we only tell our side of the story, therefore the advice provided will never be satisfactory and it will never be what we want to hear or what solve our problem.You're the only one who knows your personal wants and needs. We have more than enough information at hand (online and offline), so we're all capable of solving our own problems once we're in tune with ourselves, we just need support. Me personally, I only complain or seek advice when I've already made up my mind and just looking to exchange sentences with my fellow human beings. I also think people do that more often than they would like to admit. ",
