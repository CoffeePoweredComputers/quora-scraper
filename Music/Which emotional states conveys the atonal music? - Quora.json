            "answer_text": "I am not sure I fully understand what is meant by \"the\" atonal music. My gut feeling is that \"the\" implies a singular goal, like all atonal music is somehow similar. The only similarity is that it is not based on functional harmony from Western Classical music. Beyond this caveat there is near infinite variety. The range of emotional states in atonal music is as wide and nuanced as the emotional range of the human experience. It is the goal of musics, atonal or otherwise, to express what even words cannot.   The term \"atonal\" has been controversial for decades. I have written about this history in the previous answer to: What is the commonly accepted definition of atonal music?  ",

            "answer_text": "Tonal or atonal, music is a language that conveys various emotional states, named or unnamed. It\u2019s limitless in expression and will only grow with time and technology. It could be joyous, enchanting, nihilistic, fatalistic, deathly, ghastly, breezy,soulful, aggressive, subtle - you can name some and call others \u201cunnamed\u201d. Ifwe look at Wagner\u2019s music, notably inspired by Indian Classical music, itstexture is complex yet consistent, multi-threaded yet unified, pretty much likeour emotions - We all have multiple feelings at one time but all in a singledirection of thought. We have multiple thoughts at one time but all in singledirection of feeling. So, yes both are contrary yet existential. That to me isthe power of expressive, emotive, evocative music that we are all so privilegedto hear and appreciate. Visit: www.worldvoidweb.com ",
