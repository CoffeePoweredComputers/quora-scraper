            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll categorise the comedy anime I have seen in three (fighting-game-like) tiers: Very good (S tier[1])GoodLess goodHonorable mentionsAll the anime below had, at least for my tastes, a high amount of laughs per episode, among other positive traits. An anime doesn\u2019t have to be a \u201ccomedy anime\u201d to be funny and make my tier list. _________________________ Very good (S tier) _________________________ Nichijou  Nichijou is practically the female equivalent of Daily Lives of High School Boys, but more zany and frenetic. The comedy is very physical rather than intellectual. It involves the characters doing things and getting into (or out of) comedic situations. Don\u2019t let the art style fool you into thinking it\u2019s all cutesy and kiddy. It\u2019s not. It has some of the best animation I\u2019ve seen. Strong points include: high amount of laughs per episodemany short skits per episode, while still telling a larger story (somewhat)a show about nothing that is still somehow tremendously entertaininggrounded in everyday lifedoesn\u2019t take itself seriously at all almost no episode is boring; you want to keep watchingsome jokes fall flat or are only understandable by people who understand the Japanese culture, but those are rare and don\u2019t diminish the seriestouching moments that actually say worthwhile things (but not too many, heh)scenes where the characters are shown with strange, deadpan facial expressions  hilarious overreactions (that\u2019s a sausage she\u2019s trying to grab with chop sticks) The pace is intense, but it has moments of calm and some short breaks between some skits, so it goes down well, rather than being overwhelming. I\u2019ll review it one day. But you don\u2019t need that. It\u2019s well worth watching. I recommend it without hesitation. I\u2019ll share some videos of the skits below, so you can get an idea of what it\u2019s like. I\u2019ll share a few, because the style of this show is so off-the-wall that it\u2019s hard to get a good feel for it from just one. One of the skits\u2014three of the main characters out camping:  (continued\u2026)  (continued\u2026)  Another classic skit:  Another recurring skit about a girl who likes a guy, but assaults him with various weapons rather than telling him she likes him:  One of the main characters saying how she saves the best part of her lunch\u2014in this case a frankfurt\u2014for last and the hilarity that ensues:  Another skit featuring three of the main characters\u2014the child Professor (that\u2019s her name) who built a robot called Nano, and a talking cat. Seems kiddy, but these characters are great and add an important contrast to the other characters:  (continued\u2026)  A skit featuring a girl who forgot to do her homework, who asks her friend to borrow her notebook. Her friend gives her the notebook then remembers something:  (continued\u2026)  (continued\u2026)   Daily Lives of High School Boys  Daily Lives of High School Boys (in Japanese: Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou) is practically the male equivalent of Nichijou (which I mentioned above). Strong points include: high amount of laughs per episodemany short skits per episode, while still telling a larger story (somewhat)a show about nothing that is still somehow tremendously entertaininggrounded in everyday lifedoesn\u2019t take itself seriously at all almost no episode is boring; you want to keep watchingsome jokes fall flat or are only understandable by people who understand the Japanese culture, but those are rare and don\u2019t diminish the seriestouching moments that actually say worthwhile things (but not too many, heh)scenes where the characters are shown with strange, deadpan facial expressions The pace is a little slower and less intense than Nichijou. The series is a big parody of the whole anime genre and other things I don\u2019t know enough about to recognise. It also includes a recurring skit called \u201cHigh School Girls are Funky\u201d that focuses on girls rather than boys. I\u2019ll review it one day. But you don\u2019t need that. It\u2019s well worth watching. I recommend it without hesitation. Trailer:  One of the skits:  Another classic skit (this one is a recurring one throughout the series):  The \u201cHigh School Girls Are Funky\u201d skit (all of them, actually\u2026 just watch a few to get an idea):  _________________________ Good _________________________ The Devil is a Part-Timer!  Get through the first episode, and it\u2019s pretty much great from there on. The basic premise is \u201ctake unlikely characters and put them in an unlikely environment and watch what happens.\u201d The result is pretty hilarious. A great thing about this is that it: doesn\u2019t involve high school students (there is one, but the majority of them are older)it isn\u2019t set in a high school and actually includes some workplace scenes and other environments   It looks a bit kiddy due to the art style, but it isn\u2019t. I found the art style quite refreshing and modern, often with vibrant and tasteful use of CGI. I couldn\u2019t find a good trailer, so here\u2019s the episode opening video:  // There are English dub trailers, though I generally stay away from English dubs (though Berserk and DBZ was okay). Other clips won\u2019t do it justice, since this anime is all about context and setup. Working!  Much less zany than both Nichijou and Daily Lives of High School Boys, but still great and enjoyable. It\u2019s about the staff that work at a family restaurant. What a crazy cast they are. Many of them have unrealistic traits, but it results in much hilarity. It doesn\u2019t have the same multiple skits per episode format due to being episodic, though there are many skits within the larger context of that episode. Not quite as many laughs per episode as Daily Lives of High School Boys and Nichijou, but still good. Trailer:   Servant X Service  Much less zany than all of the above, but still great. Based on a manga by the same person who created Working! It\u2019s set in the workplace of a civil servant office. Despite the title, it has nothing to do with BDSM. Not quite as many laughs per episode as Daily Lives of High School Boys and Nichijou, but still good. Trailer:  _________________________ Less good _________________________ None so far.  Anything else I\u2019ve seen doesn\u2019t make the cut. I expect to at least chuckle a few times in the first episode, and have a consistent level of comedy quality throughout the series. If it: starts strong then drops offtakes more than three episodes to get into ithas comedy that is vulgar, lame, or just isn\u2019t funny\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make the list. _________________________ Honourable mentions _________________________ One Piece. Less humour per episode and more combat, but the humour can range from good to laugh out loud funny. Silly at times, but it adds a lightness to the series that makes it enjoyable. The pacing can be pretty bad, because they add filler to the anime so that it keeps up with the manga. We need a One Piece: Kai (filler cut out).Footnotes[1] In some games, the rank above A is S.

            "answer_text": "I've been following Anime for more than a decade now and I don't remember much in detail about the hundreds of anime I've watched over the years, so I'll just make a list of them with what I remember. Baka to test to shoukanjuu was the series that made me laugh the most, it was mostly slapstick kind of comedy but it worked very effectively. Theere is highschool battle element to it which makes things interesting. It has 2 seasons and both are very enjoyable. Saiki kusuo is a brilliant series with unique style of comedy but not uncommon for japanese programs. It employ fast pace of talking and episodic format with character development taking lower precedence than comedy but not ignored completely. It's about Saiki a high school boy with overpowered psychic abilities that is controlled by 2 tiny hairclips on his head. Even though he is a logical and aloof type of person, all kinds of people are attracted towards him because of his genuine nature and the Saiki group is formed. Guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The art is minimal but not bad. Grand blue - is one of the recent ones. It's about a bunch of scooba diving enthusiasts belonging to a scooba diving club. Two new recruits, college students join the bunch, discover drinking, scooba diving and fooling around while trying to entertain us with College Life and slapstick comedy. Next to baka to test this series made me laugh the most. Art is also excellent and fan service is also a part of its charm. School rumble - is relatively old but memorable comedy series. It really does things in a simple innocent way. The characters are also simple and innocent. The main characters are a highschool delinquent type guy and a simple minded girl he has a crush on. The story between the two takes precedence and worth a try for its heartwarming effort. Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru - this is the highest recommended by me of the list because I enjoy intelligent comedy more than slapstick even though slapstick gets more laughs. This series is like life of debate between the high school boy who is pessimistic and highly pragmatic and a his classmate who is a super sophisticated and straight A\u2019s girl. How the boy thinks, how the girls thinks and clash between them , the debates and reconciliation form the crux of the story. The charactor development takes precedence here and the developments in the story are just too good to leave it without binge watching. Prison school - prison school comes into those category of anime that are extremely refined, and seemed to know how to deliver something precisely though at the expense of being formulaic. It belongs to the likes of baka toh test and grand blue where the laugh delivery is instant and effective. Weighing in heavily on the slapstick delivery, it tells the struggles and tribulations of a bunch of high school boys who are a minority in a previously all girls school with a unique system that enforces prison time as punishments and disciplinary action by the student president and prefect body. The boys are viewed as vile creatures by the residents and some normal youthful adventures from the boys ends up getting them thrown in the prison. Plenty of potential for comedy with the said setting and very effectively used. There are a set of series like Kaichou wa maid-sama, Seitokai yakuindomo, Kaguya-sama: Love Is War that belong to a set of comedies that are focused on seto kai or the school prefect leader setup. Though each of them have very different delivery systems. Kaichou wa maid-sama is the oldest and can be said to be the one that really started the wave of seto kai based comedies so I would recommend that. It's about a school prefect leader who is also works as a maid in a cafe. Her secret revealed accidentally to a guy and story continues. Kaguya sama is the most different and recent of these. Its a story of awkwardness between two people in love, the perfect body president and the vice president. They are not ready to admit to the other their love before the other concedes and admits it. They try their hardest to feign professionalism and indifference and come up with plots to confirm the feeling of the other and Love becomes a war, where one who admits first is the loser. Though there are a plenty of others I enjoyed and can be recommended these remain one of my favorites. And it hope to see more from. I have deliberately not included those that start at comedy and go of to more serious hardcore tracks though they were very enjoyable. ",
