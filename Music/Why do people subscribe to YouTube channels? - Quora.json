            "answer_text": "\u201cSubscribers\u201d is a very odd metric YouTube places an unusual amount of importance on compared to overall total viewership or some other set of big data. Granted, I\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a channel that regularly gets millions of views on videos that also has a subscriber count under a thousand. That is, there is a fairly reliable causal connection between the two, though it\u2019s always possible for a channel with few subscribers to have one and only one video that gets millions of views, those flash-in-the-pan viral sensations that are essentially the product of luck, circumstance, and timing more than legitimate talent and effort (someone trashing a game store display or screaming obscenities in a daycare or the like). If you want to get technical about it, this distinction between one-off successes and regular output is why subscribers are held in such high regard. This is all \u201cbackend\u201d stuff, though, what it means to the platform and maybe by extension to the crators. As for what it means for the viewers to subscribe: In practice, supposedly, subscribing to a channel means more of that channel\u2019s videos will appear in my feed. I say supposedly because the means by which YouTube\u2019s various algorithms and machine learning processes recommend videos or queue suggestions is shrouded in mystery. Moreover, unless you plan on arbitrarily limiting the number of channels you subscribe to for various reasons, chances are you\u2019re going to have a lot of videos to sort through anyway before you get to a specific channel and will probably just end up searching anyway or flipping through your playlists. In principle, actually, it\u2019s more of a gesture of good faith for the creator, the equivalent of signing a guestbook. It\u2019s also an informal promise to keep an eye out for their next video. Of course, if a channel doesn\u2019t output videos all that regularly, like an animation channel, and you\u2019ve got a number of other subscriptions clogging your feed as we detailed earlier, there\u2019s that whole bell icon business that actively sends you a notification when a video is uploaded. How that metric plays into YouTube\u2019s AI antics (subscribers versus bell ringers versus whatever) is an even deeper mystery than how it recommends certain videos from channels you may not even be subscribed to.

            "answer_text": "By being a subscriber, you are publicly adding yourself to the acceptance of a Youtube channel. The more subscribers a channel has, the more followers it has. The dictionary defines subscribe as \u201carrange to receive something regularly, typically a publication, by paying in advance.\u201d So this basically means that by subscribing to a Youtube channel, you are telling the channel owner \u201cI like your channel. I will keep myself notified whenever a new video comes out. I will also subscribe to show the public that I like this channel\u201d ",
