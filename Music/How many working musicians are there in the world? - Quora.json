            "answer_text": "Don't have that info, BUT I do have a source for info for the United States..  It's the US Dept of Labor.  They base their estimates on reports from tax returns, etc. Here's my page regarding this: MUSIC JOBS - Yes, they DO exist!  Lots of good info and links to good sources.  The general picture is the music 'population' has been on an increase.  This also includes salaries.  Note that ALL sorts of people who work with and in music are included, teachers, theatre company personnel who are directly involved in making music, etc. I'd say, using these figures as a guide, that the TOTAL number of working musicians in the world is only a small percent of the world population.  But, as Mel Brooks' 2000-year-old man said: \"If everyone when they were born, were given a violin, we would all be bigger and better than MANTOVANI!! Look those guys up if you didn't laugh heartily. :) By the way, are you a musician?  You should be if you are not.. The world NEEDS as many as it can get! ",

            "answer_text": "I was one of the only ones I knew who made ninety nine percent of his income from performing music.  Well, amongst my friends, acquaintances, band mates and well-known musicians in this town of 200,000 people, only about two or three out of a hundred do not have a salaried position somewhere else.  by inference,  since there are 7.3 Billion people on the Earth, (7,000,330,000)?  Is that right?  My math isn't great.  THEN if three percent of the Earth play as a profession, there are about ...CRAP!  I can't figure it out.  My calculator doesn't go that high.  There's the reason I was a musician, I couldn't do math. ",
