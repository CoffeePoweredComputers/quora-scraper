            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an ophthalmologist. But as someone with a vision impairment, I\u2019ve spent considerable time thinking about the visual artifacts we experience and where they come from. When the eye is open, the retina processes incoming light and images into a code that it sends down the optic nerve to the brain. (Scientists now understand this code; Take a look at this TED Talk: A prosthetic eye to treat blindness) When your eyes are closed, the retina receives no light or images from the outside world. However, the retina and optic nerve are part of your nervous system and are continually active. It\u2019s possible that random activity in the retina or optic nerve sends a coded signal to your brain for \u201cface\u201d or \u201cscenery\u201d. Many people commonly see flashes or patterns of light known as photopsia. It\u2019s possible your brain is interpreting these random patterns as \u201cface\u201d or \u201cscenery\u201d. You might wonder why \u201cface\u201d and \u201cscenery\u201d seem to be the most common. This is almost certainly because recognizing faces and landforms are a adaptive abilities. They are the things we inherently recognize due to evolution. Some vision impaired persons have extremely compelling visual hallucinations. This is known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome. (Look it up on Wikipedia.) I must suspect that visual hallucinations are more of a spectrum, and that we all experience them to a greater or lesser degree. ",
