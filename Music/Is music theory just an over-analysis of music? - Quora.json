            "answer_text": "It seems that everyone who has said \u201cno\u201d below (i.e., pretty much everyone) is not a professional music theorist. As someone who has interacted with and read a great deal of literature in the professional field of music theory, I can testify that a lot of it is indeed overanalyzing, especially when the intellectual sophistry betrays the more musical explanations. (For my own professional sake, I probably should not be so disparaging in public, but anyway,) have a look at Richard Cohn\u2019s Audacious Euphony and David Damschroder\u2019s Harmony in \u2026 series for examples of music-theoretical scholarship that (in my opinion) are over-intellectualized and lacking in musical insight. (This does not mean that all professional music theory is similarly uninformative\u2014Marshall Tuttle\u2019s monograph Musical Structures in Wagnerian Opera is a prime example of highly technical yet insightful music-theoretical scholarship.) That being said, there remains a (rather large) distinction between \u201cmusic theory\u201d as it is meant when the average person uses that term (something that a music theorist would call rudiments) and \u201cmusic theory\u201d as academics/music theorists/musicologists use that term. Presumably, you meant \u201cmusic theory\u201d in the first sense (as does every other answerer), and in this sense, I agree with everyone else that a study of musical rudiments (even including harmony) does not constitute over-analysis of any sort. It is only when one enters into the contentious realm of Schenkerian analysis, neo-Riemannian theory, hexatonic cycles, and the like where things can get fuzzy (and useless) very fast.  NB: I do not mean that Schenkerian analysis and the like is utter hogwash. I do think that Schenkerian analysis is grossly flattening in treating harmony as an artifact of counterpoint and glossing over crucial \u201cnon-structural\u201d harmonies that are (ironically) what create the interesting structures, but for music which is a Schenkerian paradise anyway (e.g., Corelli), it works okay. (Another very serious critique of Schenkerian analysis is that it predetermines the result, i.e., proclaims how music should be and categorizes deviations from its predetermined structures as deformations. Much more assiduous critiques of Schenkerian analysis can be found in Eugene Narmour\u2019s Beyond Schenkerism: The Need for Alternatives in Music Analysis, Bengt Edlund\u2019s Questioning Schenkerism, and Lodewijk Muns\u2019 \u201cWhy I am not a Schenkerian.\u201d) Riemann, on the other hand, flattened out crucial functions by only acknowledging tonic, subdominant, and dominant function (whereas, e.g., mediant function also exists), and this led to a warped view of function that has now trickled into undergraduate harmony pedagogy. My point is to explain that I am not lambasting these theories because they are arcane or turgid (which they often are, incidentally) but because they are one-dimensional (and, as such, not insightful). As I mentioned earlier (with reference to Musical Structures in Wagnerian Opera), some \u201cadvanced\u201d music-theoretical frameworks are indeed highly insightful, like linear harmonic analysis (see Leland Smith\u2019s book Handbook of Harmonic Analysis for a full exposition).

            "answer_text": "No, music theory is not an overanalysis of music. I\u2019m tired of the popular opinion that music theory somehow overanalyzes and thus destroys the beauty of music. There is absolutely no harm in learning why certain chord progressions/harmonies/[insert aspect of music here] sound good and why others don\u2019t, which is what music theory seeks to do. Learning why your favorite moment in a song sounds so good won\u2019t decrease your enjoyment of it, nor will it deprive the music of its mystery. Music theory is an incredibly beneficial thing for composers, arrangers, and even performers to learn because it reveals the underlying structure of music itself and can save a ton of time when you\u2019re looking for that epic, earth-shattering chord to write or wondering why everything you write sounds like a ripoff of Mozart. If music theory was actually an over-analysis of music and no one bothered to learn it because of this, music production would creep forward at a snail\u2019s pace. No one would be able to generate the sounds they wanted. The great composers of the past and of the present\u2014Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Czerny, Wagner, Boulez, Debussy, Ligeti\u2014would certainly not have been able to create the masterpieces they left behind without the deep knowledge of music that the theory gave them. This isn\u2019t to say that it isn\u2019t possible to overanalyze music; there are certainly subtleties that can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be explained. However, music theory never really analyzes to this excessive degree. Ultimately I think the reason this myth is so common is that people always view music as more of a talent than a skill, when it is really mostly skill like most other things. Most people don\u2019t think knowing grammar is over-analyzing language (because people view writing more as a skill than a talent), yet some of those same people paradoxically think music theory is over-analysis of music when the two are analogous.
