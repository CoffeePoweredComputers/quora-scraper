            "answer_text": "This happened to me a few years ago. I had a few negative things happen in quick succession and was quite depressed for a while, started taking antidepressants, and it was as if one day I just woke up and music was empty. I felt better, I wasn't depressed anymore, but for a very long time I couldn't feel music anymore, could barely listen to it. It was an odd feeling - a mixture of numbness and pain - that music would inspire in me and so I chose not to play it pretty much at all, which was so strange for me when I have always been obsessed with it. About three years passed and nothing changed until I started a new relationship; the two of us would often play cards with a drink in the evening and you have to have music then - but it still felt off to me, so I asked my then-boyfriend to tell me new music - I didn't play anything I already knew. We have very similar and diverse taste, and because the songs were new to me, they had no emotional context. And it worked! I loved music again. For a while, only the new songs, but gradually I rebuilt my repertoire, got over my block, fell in love with it as I fell in love with him. I've recently broken up with him and at first I was scared that the same thing would happen, but I knew how to break it - find new music and gradually phase the rest back in, and it's absolutely worked for me. It will be a long time until I can listen to certain songs without sadness, but I get there. For me, I think what happened was that the traumas I faced left me so hurt that the music I already knew brought back sadness and pain - it wasn't music, it was the feelings associated with THAT music. I don't know if this helps you at all, but my advice to anyone feeling this way is find something entirely new. New bands, a new genre or two if you can manage it. There's so much out there that's beautiful and doesn't hurt, so much new, it takes a bit of research but without my Spotify I don't know what I'd do! The radio is great too. ",

            "answer_text": "Your specificity of time makes me suspect that there was some kind of impactful event which took place in your life three years ago. Perhaps it was emotional, perhaps you sustained a brain injury. What is your age? How's your endocrine system? Are you passing through any endochrine-related milestones? Did you begin taking any Rx psychotropic medications? There are lots of reasons this could have happened, including experiencing a trauma which does not immediately look or feel like a trauma. Trauma is a tricky thing in that you may not be able to comprehend that you have experienced it until some time passes. The brain is absolutely marvelous at self-defense mechanisms, no matter their consequential inconvenience to us. If trauma is the cause, then you may need to think back to when you noticed music's hold on you beginning to ebb. What was happening? You may do well to seek counsel if trauma is a likely factor. Did you suffer a brain injury? Are you sure? Think back. That bump on the head that was just aggravating as hell could actually have been more severe than you initially thought, particularly as your age advances. Subdural hematoma is not out of the question entirely if you are above 50 and whack your head on something. Have you noticed changes in your health overall? Metabolism? Temperature regulation? Hormones play an annoyingly complex and strong role in how our brains behave. Our brains are bathed in these chemicals all the time, but it's still kind of a crap shoot (that professionals are getting better at) when guessing 1. if there is a chemical/hormonal imbalance 2. What in the bloody hell it is; 3. How to treat it properly... ...Which segues nicely into psychotropic Rx medications. In my experience as a patient who is thirsty to learn more and more, throwing Rx at the brain is a little like trying to shoot a moving target from the back of a moving vehicle during an earthquake with a bow and arrow. People metabolize things very differently from one another. I, for instance, learned through genetic testing that I do not metabolize folate sufficiently from the food I eat, no matter how healthy I eat. I have to take a medicinal food compound (L-methylfolate Ca) to combat this. Incidentally, it has helped lessen my depression, which is great! Coincidentally, I learned that some of the other Rx I had been prescribed in the past were nothing short of toxic poison for my nervous system, and I nearly died as a result of some poor planning on the part of a doctor...but that's a whole other thing. Anyway these brain drugs can dull your feelings to the point of numbness. This may or may not be a lasting effect.  Do not give up. I too am genuinely moved by music and sometimes find it extremely beneficial to my overall function as a human being. Accept things as they are for now, and allow yourself to believe that now =/= The Future, so things could take a swing back in the opposite direction. P.S. As an artist, I gave up fine art for eight years. EIGHT YEARS. Just couldn't seem to get into it anymore. Something changed in my brain, and now the creative juices are flowing faster than I can collect them in rain barrels! I am back at it and doing very well. Love, peace, and blessings to you.  ",
