            "answer_text": "Not yet, although it is seeming as thought the band's future is unclear. Mike Shinoda has had a wonderful success with his solo album, Post-Traumatic, and I'd love to see more of his work with others like he did on projects like Fort Minor. So far, I seem to be the only one in these answers who doesn't want to see the band continue on without Chester. And I would greatly respect the band's decision to not continue as \u201cLinkin Park\u201d if they choose not to do so. How could listening to a full album without Chester Bennington be the same experience? I don't believe a band has to go on forever for their impact to last forever in our hearts. Look at all the fans, myself one of them, who have come out after Chester's passing and stated how his presence in LP's music affected them directly. I do respect that this decision has not been an easy one for Mike and the other band members to make hastily. As a fan since Hybrid Theory came out, I would prefer that they continue on their path as great musicians, but LP is not LP without Chester\u2026let them change the band name if anything. And I don't think I'd be the only one who would be mad if he were replaced by a different frontman. Thank you for the A2A. RIP Chester. ",

Of course their songs are sometimes messages about their current emotional status and with their newest release called \u201cGood Goodbye\u201d I can expect a lot of people to think what you asked. But I assure you, they\u2019re not going anywhere anytime soon. They\u2019re like brothers. They love their fanbase like family. Even in the past they gave us songs like \u201cI\u2019ll Be Gone\u201d, \u201cWaiting For The End\u201d, etc. but here they are. They\u2019re doing fine. ",

Its more like, after Chester\u2019s death, Linkin Park has lost all its motivation, its lost all its fire. But, I believe that LP has still got some juice in it. It will go on. It HAS to. Millions of fans are there to support LP, and if they get disbanded, there will be millions of heart breaks. Lets all hope for the best. R.I.P Chester. You are one of my childhood heroes. \\m/ ",

One of the band-members even stated that the band is in the process of healing from the wounds of the disaster, but they are still going to be together.
