            "answer_text": "There are a few reasons I prefer to listen instead of talking. I\u2019m really shy to people I don\u2019t know well.If they want to have a conversation, that\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s hard for me to talk to them and the conversations don\u2019t usually last long.I\u2019m not very good with words and am interested in things many people aren\u2019t, such as Mandarin TV shows.I\u2019m not interested in a lot of things my peers like to talk about, like popular American musicians, TV shows like Grey\u2019s Anatomy, etc. I don\u2019t listen to or watch them, so there\u2019s not much I can say.I may have something to contribute to the conversation, but would rather hear other people\u2019s opinions. Of course, if somebody wants my opinion I\u2019ll give it.Often, my friends talk really quickly anyway and by the time they pause long enough for me to get a word in edgewise they\u2019ll have completely moved on.There\u2019s so much you can learn from listening to others.This is why I prefer to listen in class instead of present. This is also how I found out some things about certain people, which lowered my admiration for them a bit. It\u2019s how I learned how to filter gossip and to only really believe something about someone if they say so themselves, and if they\u2019re not someone who would lie to get attention. It\u2019s how I learn things about people who are important to me, be it their favorite color or what they hope the future holds for them. It\u2019s how I began to be introduced to things I never even knew existed while sheltered from the world. Listening to others is how I was introduced to opinions different than those my dad tried to shove down our throat at home, and how I came to realize it\u2019s okay to accept things outside of the norm.It\u2019s how I learned about different kind of people, thoughts, ideas, opinions, beliefs, and more. Listening to others is how I became who I am today. ",

            "answer_text": "I learned a LONG time ago in Sales that talking is NOT selling, \u201cListening IS selling!\u201d You say so what? That's not what I asked! Ok, the REASON I prefer to listen is WE as a whole, are ALWAYS selling something! Be it ourselves, an idea, a point of view, a friendship, what ever you think of, WE sell it. What MOST people are looking for in a friend in this life, is someone to REALLY LISTEN to them! Not just hear them and nod, but to truly listen, add up the facts, and give them solid advice, IF they seek it. Or just to listen and tell them what EVERYONE really wants to hear. That is, \u201cEverything is going to be alright!\u201d Then tell them WHY! Any one can just SAY it. But, IF you truly listen, you CAN give reasons WHY it will be alright. If you Truly do Listen, you will become one of the most popular people in ANY group, be it at work or at social events. I OFTEN times feel like I have a stamp on my forehead that says, \u201cTALK TO ME!\u201d I don't know why it is? I am often told it's my eyes. (As these are Total Strangers that just walk up to me and start telling me some of their most intimate secrets and problems. At parties, at work, in Walmart, buying food, just standing outside a shop at the mall waiting for my wife even!) I have NO CLUE WHY?? I have always been popular, but once I stopped talking so much, and I Really started listening instead, my popularity really grew! In my personal life, and my business life as well. That's WHY I listen. ",
