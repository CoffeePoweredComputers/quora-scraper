            "answer_text": "Beyond getting something really inexpensive like a First Act, guitars are more about tone and playability than they are about some sort of gamification so it depends on what type of music you want to play. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t play jazz on an Ibanez or metal on a hollowbody, but certain guitars have certain tones that lend themselves more to the idea of how a guitar should sound in a certain setting. So, for guitars under $500, you\u2019ve got quite a range, especially if you choose to go used. For all around, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with getting a Mexican Strat. Nice tone, decent playability, solidly built. I\u2019ve still got mine from the early 90\u2019s and I still love it. Plus, Strats are popular and you can easily customize your guitar.  For heavier rock, perhaps an Ibanez RGA would suit you. They tend to have a bit more of a nasally sound, but Ibanez guitars are pretty lightning fast on the neck.  For jazz, I would go with a hollow body like the Epiphone Joe Pass or something like that. Fairly inexpensive with a solid neck and a nice deep tone.  For acoustics, I would go with a Taylor GS Mini or Martin X Series (not the backpacker though - that\u2019s a piece of shit). Both manufacturers make excellent sounding acoustics and you will definitely notice the richness over a more inexpensive one. If you can\u2019t find them new for under $500, you can probably get one used.   Ultimately though, you\u2019ve got a lot more questions to ask than just price. Furthermore, this isn\u2019t a question that anyone on here can definitively answer because choosing a guitar is a very personal choice. If I had $500 and needed a guitar to fit a particular style, I would probably start by looking at one of the above, but it might not necessarily be the one I eventually choose. ",
