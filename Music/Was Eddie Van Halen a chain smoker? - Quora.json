            "answer_text": "Edward Van Halen was definitely a \u201cheavy smoker\u201d. I can\u2019t tell you how many cigarettes he smoked, but I\u2019ve seen estimates of him smoking more than two packs (40 cigarettes) per day, which could be considered \u201cchain smoking\u201d. Vocalist Sammy Hagar said than during practice, he would always have a lit cigarette going in the headstock of his guitar, though sometimes it would burn all the way down with him not puffing it. He also had a history of alcoholism and abused other drugs. Per Esquire interview (linked below) EVH\u2019s DAD gave him his first cigarette at age 12!
