            "answer_text": "Obsessed is the word that I believe needs to be replaced. Idols ARE kpop. They are not obsessed with themselves. When idols speak about their desire or enjoyment of kpop not one has ever used that word. Idols in any aspect of Korean entertainment are no different than any other person in any country. They were inspired by an idol, love to perform, realized it early and went for their dream. Shownu of MonstaX said Rain inspired him, Jungkook of BTS was inspires by Taeyang of Big Bang and I am inspired by Wonho. Here is the difference: they saw someone doing something they wanted to do too so they went about the business of learning how to do it. Not obsession it's inspiration, motivation and aspiration. I see kpop and all the men I want to date and marry and drool over and play their songs over and over and get their merch and draw their pics and participate in their fandom and go to their concerts and stay up til all times of night (because Korea is around 15hrs ahead of me)to be able to there the moment their video song premieres or watch their stages on tv or online and defend them fiercely to anybody who even remotely wants to get froggy about my Bunny Wonho. There! That is obsession. Do you see the difference? Lololol! I am sooooooo obsessed with Wonho. This is year #6 of my obsession. I have the nerve to be proud of it too and that is the step over to insanity. But I am no sasaeng. Idols are not obsessed. ",
