They would probably just put some members into the next group they\u2019re making or maybe debut them into different units. I would also assume 3RACHA would still be together since they\u2019re a pre-debut group. We never know. I can see some of them dabbling into the acting business if Stray Kids disbanded. But honestly it\u2019s hard to say.  ",
