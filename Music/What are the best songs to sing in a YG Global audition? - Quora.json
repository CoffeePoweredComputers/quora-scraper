            "answer_text": "Just choose any song you're comfortable with. If you're singing but you can't hit high notes well, don't choose a high pitched song. Just choose a song that fits your voice. If you're dancing but your dancing style is more on fluidity and balance rather than sharpness and power, then choose a choreography that would fit your style the best. Either way goodluck on your audition!^^ ",

I don\u2019t recommend to sing a cute song cus that\u2019s not what YG is about. Don\u2019t go to a hip hop company singing Twice \ud83d\ude05 Hope this helped you \ud83d\ude01! ",
