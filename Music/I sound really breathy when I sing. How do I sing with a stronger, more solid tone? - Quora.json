It's really best to get a teacher to help you learn the difference, and train your voice to remove the airiness.  It's fine to have airiness stylistically, but not all the time.  When you are singing in an airy way, you can't produce vibrato, you can't find that level of resonance, you just end up blowing your air without grounded sound. I don't think I could have overcome my issues with cord closure without a teacher, before I started lessons I had no idea what the trouble was, I only knew that I used to be able to sing and now I couldn't.  I've long since cleared up the airiness issue, it's been 2.5 years of singing lessons now. My teacher gave me a lot of exercises to help me become aware of what my voice was doing.  Using consonants will help you feel out how they are formed - most of my earliest exercises were using 'n' and 'g' to start with, usually depending on how my voice was that day.  You can try a taunt, i.e. \"nah nah\" where the 'a' sounds like 'can' and other vowels, and also try a \"gug gug\" kind of sound to get better closure.  A teacher will be able to guide you based on what your voice is doing.  If you are doing only the same vocal exercises, you can overcompensate in both directions in turn, until you know what you are doing, yourself, and can judge which exercises will be more helpful that day.  Find a really good teacher, even temporarily, to help evaluate your voice and provide you with some guidance.  A few lessons can get you started, at least, and then if you can't afford it, you can try periodic lessons instead.  Perhaps a teacher might be able to arrange to have you come less frequently than weekly or bi-weekly.  You can potentially damage your speaking voice by singing in a breathy way, as well, so pay attention to see if your speaking voice is also breathy, or not.  I didn't realize that was what I was doing, until it became hard to talk for long and I began lessons and the teacher told me.   ",
