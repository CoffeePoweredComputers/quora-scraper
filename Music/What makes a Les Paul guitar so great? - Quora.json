            "answer_text": "A blend of history and mythology, hype and statistically inevitable gems, and turning a blind eye to the price. Now, there are many very fine Les Pauls Gibson has put out over the years, but also quite a few very expensive duds, especially as of late. Gibson\u2019s quality control has declined over the past few decades while the price keeps rising on the hot air of marketing and historical popularity. A well-made Les Paul, however, is a thing of beauty. Craftsmanship and attractive finish is much of the upcharge for a fine U.S. made Les Paul. Beyond that, Les Pauls are known for having excellent sustain for their large, heavy body (not, it should be noted, because of the set-neck - bolt-on necks perform virtually identically) as well as a good tone, thanks to their mid/low-output humbuckers. Tone is subjective, however, and I can\u2019t help but think that our collective interpretation of \u201cgood\u201d tone is skewed by the history of great players playing classic guitars with classic pickups because that\u2019s all that was available at the time. In summary; a Gibson LP is a nice guitar, but there\u2019s nothing magical about them, and there\u2019s often little to no real improvement in quality over guitars that cost a half, a third, or even a fifth of the price of an instrument marked with the coveted \u201cMade in America\u201d sticker. If you have strong political feelings about this and have several thousand dollars to put into it, by all means, go for it! Just be aware that an Epiphone or an Agile Les Paul with a nice setup (a fret level, at most) will play just as well, with even less perceptible difference in sound quality. *One thing people might point out about the value of a U.S.A. guitar is perceived resale value; that you are saving money in the long run. While this is the case if you bought a Les Paul in 1959, this is not the case today. I did an in-depth regression analysis and found that Gibson held value 6% worse than the control group. Epiphone, interestingly, held value 14% better than the control, so that\u2019s another little mark in favor of the cheaper sister brand. ",

            "answer_text": "Gibson Les Paul guitars are very well made, but the design is deliberately nostalgic, and they don\u2019t benefit from most of the advances in guitar making since the 1960s. The exception here is that Gibson and their second-line Epiphone Les Pauls are available with a variety of modern electronics options not present on the originals. The characteristics of the Les Paul which distinguish it from other guitars are: Super-heavy body which gives it a long, 20-second natural sustain, and enormous resistance to feedback, even at high volumes. Shorter scale length than Stratocasters, which gives a mellower tone and makes bending and vibrato easier. Glued neck which in principle should give better resonance than a bolt-on neck. Neck and Bridge humbucker pickups which reduce noise and offer a meatier, warmer and harmonically richer sound. Modern Les Pauls have coil splitting so you can also use the pickups in single-coil mode, for a brighter, cleaner sound. Separate tone and volume controls for each pickup. Opinions vary on how useful the tone controls actually are, as they only roll off top. However, on classic Les Pauls, there is a gradual loss of treble as the volume is turned down, which, when paired with a high treble-gain Marshall amplifier, gives a throaty, human sound as the volume control is opened up toward overdrive. Bound neck, with bound fret-ends. This doesn\u2019t really change the sound but it gives it a more finished look. Single cutaway. Many people imagine that a single cutaway is harder to play high up, but this has not really proven a problem. Wider frets than on Stratocasters, for smoother vibrato and bending. Fixed bridge (on almost all models), instead of the floating bridges fitted to guitars that had tremolo arms. This meant the the tremolo effect was unavailable, but intonation was more consistent and sustain was much greater. Tone was also deeper. The Les Paul helped to define the sound of rock in the 1970s, though many guitarists continued to prefer the Stratocaster, the Telecaster or boutique guitars. This was partly because the enhanced volume of the hum bucker, and reduced noise, was perfect for ultra-high gain (for then) Marshall amplifiers, meaning that they could achieve levels of overdrive not otherwise available. Since the 1980s, distortion, overdrive and gain pedals have allowed any kind of guitar to overdrive an amplifier, and since the late seventies, Marshalls have been available with Master-Volume controls so that overdrive could be obtained at lower levels. Better electronics on Yamaha, Ibanez, Washburn and Aria guitars coming from Japan, coupled with innovative build techniques such as through-necks on Yamaha SG-2000s put the 1970s and 1980s Les Pauls in the shade. They were generally considered to be dramatically inferior to the 1958\u201360 models, although prices of vintage \u201970s Les Pauls are going up. If you\u2019ve always wanted a Gibson Les Paul, and have the money to buy one, then it\u2019s a good guitar to own. However, if you are ready to spend a lot of money on a guitar, it\u2019s worth looking at PRS, Godin, and many boutique guitars. You will certainly get a more flexible and quite possibly better playing guitar for the same price. If you\u2019re considering spending a lot of money on a Les Paul copy, even one of the high-end ones made over the years by Tokai, then you might want to think again. The prices of copies will never keep pace with original Gibsons, even if the build is actually superior.  Edit: This post seems to have come across as more controversial than intended. I\u2019m not trying to recommend Les Pauls (my Les Paul is on permanent loan to someone else) but to explain what makes them desirable to some people. Some of the things, such as glued neck, shorter scale length, heavy body and humbuckers are part of the reason that some people prefer Strats which have bolted necks, longer scale length, light body and single coil pickups. Bound necks are very much a matter of taste. Of my two main electric guitars, one has a bound neck, the other doesn\u2019t. As it happens, one of them has a glued neck, and the other bolted, one has a shorter scale, the other a longer scale, one has a heavy body, the other a light body. Both have split coil pickups. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to think of different types of guitars as \u2018better\u2019 or \u2018worse\u2019 than each other. Playing an authentic Les Paul is like playing a piece of rock history. If you want some of the Les Paul sound and feel, but want it in a modern instrument, there are plenty of LP type guitars available. Here\u2019s one which I find particularly droolsome, but it will cost you more than many of the Gibson models: Robert Fripp Signature Guitar. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t like Les Pauls and want a Strat, there are lots of Strat types available. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, yes. Attributes of a Gibson Les Paul: Tone: The sound of a Les Paul can cover many, many styles of music. Jazz, Pop, Metal, Rock, Country, Blues\u2026 etc. It has a girthy tone, with a hint of air, which makes it very unique, primarily due to the thick mahogany, w/ maple Cap (on certain models). There\u2019s very few guitars which sound like one. Whether it\u2019s PAFs or P90s, the sound is amazing. Aesthetic: They look luxurious and classic. The shape harkens back to old-school workmanship - Early 20th century jazz, and bluegrass instruments, which themselves, were nostalgic to classical stringed instruments. The finishes such as the honey burst, and the cherry sunburst look like works of art, if applied right. Issues: The tilted headstock: Yes, it can help sustain, but gosh darn it, where the neck meets the headstock is the archillies heel of Gibson guitars, not just LPs. One fall, and you\u2019re off to the repair shop. Upside is, it will come back stronger. Repair Shop Guy \u201cHhhmph, another Gibson? That\u2019s the second this week\u2026.\u201d The tilt back neck also causes strings to chew through nuts faster, and cause tuning issues. Bone nuts help here. Weight: Some LPs are heavy! Especially the 70s Norlins. Although they \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d modern LP bodies for weight relief, you can still find truly solid Les Pauls that weight in the 9lb range, like the coveted 59s. Electronics: While Gibson pickups are indeed very good, their electronics are usually substandard. They come with 300k pots, and mediocre caps. Installing 500k pots, and better caps opens up more \u201cair\u201d in the tone. I believe they intentionally \u201cdull\u201d the tone, because it sounds harsh through modelers, and mediocre solid state amps. Put a \u201850s spec wiring in, and put it through a high quality amp, and look out! My take: Guitars are a folksy, primitive instrument family. I\u2019m not sold on all the \u201cadvancements\u201d as being substitutes for the warts on previous designs. Those imperfections like weight, etc add a charm, and have some tonal qualities. Try as you might, but a PRS will not sound like a Les Paul, because the body dimensions, and the contouring take wood away, which changes physical response. A Tom Anderson Tele with a super thin neck, and intense contouring will never sound like a 50s Tele with a thick body, and a baseball bat neck. It\u2019s just different. ",

            "answer_text": " The Les Paul is the thickest solid body guitar made. This is increased by the fact that it has an arched top. An interesting piece of trivia is that this arch top was not included as part of the design to improve its tone. Gibson had a routing system that could quickly carve the top and it was suggested to Les, who said \u201csure, that would look good\u201d. It was intended as a cosmetic marketing touch imitating the big arch top jazz boxes that were the top drawer guitars of the time. The body is mahogany which gives a deep resonant full tone. The maple cap on the mahogany gives better definition and detail to the notes. Next is the use of double coil humbucking pickups which give full bodied tone, with strong mid-range frequencies, but also detailed high end notes. Less important is the fact that the neck is glued into the body with a tenon deep into the body. When it was originally designed to be a solid body jazz guitar that could be played at higher volumes with out the buzz or noise of single coil pickups and without feeding back as did the popular hollow body jazz guitar of the day. It really did not fit in with the rock and roll, country or jazz players at the time. Not many were manufactured or sold. It wasn\u2019t until it\u2019s qualities were ideally suited for really loud, heavy, hard rock music became popular. No other guitar could create the deep, full, but articulate, long sustaining tone that characterized late sixties and 70s hard rock. ",

It's probably one of the most iconic electric guitar in the world aside from the strat, and it beats the strat in looks hands down, flamed maple top and a honey burst makes any artist shed a tear. Second is its sound, it's wood gives it a strong tone, and it's set neck construction gives it excellent sustain. Gibson also makes some legit pickups for this thing.  I personally like the Dirty Fingers Gibson makes because I love output. But it seems their hands down best model is their 450R or 57' Classic. Next is its 24.75 inch scale, along with its compound 12\" radius, makes it very easy to play. Not only this, but it is made in the USA, which means higher quality parts and labor. Of course, Gibson itself lacks consistency, so it's definetely a bet getting a Les Paul, could get a great one, could get a bad one, but the vintage 59' Burst, can not, I repeat CAN NOT be beat. ",

History: Les Paul basically invented the electric guitar; the name is iconic.Weight: Classic Les Paul\u2019s are HEAVY; this contributes to the ability of the pickups to produce a singing sustain; the vibrations of the strings are not absorbed and dampened by the guitar.Action: Les Paul\u2019s have had setups where the strings are very close to the frets, making for very fast, easy playing.Pickup: A matter of debate but the early P90 \u201csoapbar\u201d single coil pickups had/have a singing, almost human vocal quality. Maybe the current two coil Humbuckers do as well for some people.\u201cLook\u201d. Along with the Strat, the Les Paul is really only one of two iconically recognizable electrics.",

            "answer_text": "A genuine Les Paul is the easiest guitar I have ever played, because of its set neck design. The more rigid the neck & body are as a whole unit, the easier it is to fret and bend strings. If a guitar \u2018gives\u2019 when you play it, then you have to fight harder to push down or bend a string. This is because you\u2019re not just moving the string down onto the neck; you\u2019re also bending the entire guitar slightly. It\u2019s a very slight bending, but it definitely factors into the ease of playing.When the guitar is very rigid, playing is much easier. Most guitarists can feel the difference between a bolt neck and a set neck. A set neck is just easier and more relaxed. You can play longer without wearing out your fret hand. This is also true of the neck-through design. Some people don\u2019t care, because they just naturally have more strength and it doesn\u2019t bother them. (Stevie Ray Vaughan was one example.)For me, playability and feel are very important, because a difficult guitar just takes all the fun out of the experience. It\u2019s like the difference between an old manual typewriter and an electric typewriter. They both did the same job, but the manual would wear out your hands faster. ",

And, because they weren\u2019t particularly popular, not too expensive on the used market. (Also, arguably, the shorter scale was slightly easier to play). Plug into an Marshall or AC30, turn up, and you had a perfect rock guitar sound for heavier rock music. ",

            "answer_text": "It has been said that a Les Paul is akin to a paint brush while a Stratocaster is like an ink pen. Strat is bright and sharp while the Les Paul is softer and more mellow. While I own several of each, they both have their place. Les Paul guitars are pretty heavy which can be a downside for live performance even though it can be a plus for sustain. Lots of personal preference involved. My advice is to pick it up and play it, see if the Les Paul is right for your style/tone/application. ",

The cheaper ones are known to have quality control issues and I cannot justify nor recommend paying more than 2000 dollars for a new guitar (for their \u2018mid\u2019range models). Epiphones however are getting really nice, I played a 250 dollar one that felt better than some extremely pricy Les Pauls! ",

            "answer_text": "There are multiple versions of the Les Paul but the one model that was Les Paul\u2019s favorite had an arched Maple Cap top with a hollow space under the pickups. There are also some variations of solid bodies that have several holes cut into the top that change the sound. Also, the original versions used stacked layers of mahogany around 1/8\u2033-3/16\u2033 thick. Early Les Pauls 1952\u20131956 and into 57 were made with P-90 single coil pickups. Some players love these sounds but the the Humbucking Twin Coil Pickups are far and away the most popular. There are many Les Pauls today that are solid body and some have an arched top with a thin veneer of Maple to simulate the the original hollowbody style. Many of these even have the plastic edge binding that is more for show. However, for my money I would want the hollow space Les Paul but Gibson and Epiphone are somewhat coy regarding which models actually have the hollowbody feature. ",
