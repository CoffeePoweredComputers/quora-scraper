            "answer_text": "I think it all depends on your goals. What is important for you in music and what drives to become better at it - as simple as it may sound. As anonymous guy pointed out below: some great artists are not particularly great singers but some are great composers or writers. If you\u2019re into classical music, one of Finnish music\u2019s golden eras all time greats: Sibelius, wasn\u2019t a good singer, and he by his own words sounded horrible. He still knew how to write emotional, harmonic, complex pieces of music. Also I think every human being can learn to sing. Of course naturally some voices might have more depth in them. It still doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t take care and give credit for your unique own voice. I\u2019m a singer myself but I don\u2019t know much about writing songs or lyrics. More importantly I need more musical theory to be able to do that effectively. ",
