            "answer_text": "Well a 40 year old song by a UK band called the Vapors is considered racist, no it was never intended. In a VH1 True Spin special, The Vapors were asked about this song, and they explained that it is a love song about someone who lost their girlfriend and was going slowly crazy. The lead singer Dave Fenton said: \"Turning Japanese is all the clich\u00e9s about angst and youth and turning into something you didn't expect to.\" It was inspired by Fenton's personal relationship problems. Though there is the \u201coriental riff\u201d cliche in the tune which can be found in a few songs like Carl Lewis\u2019 \u201cKung Fu fighting\u201d[1] and \u201cHong Kong Gardens\u201d[2] by Souixie and the Banshees and that song was certainly not racist as well as the opening song to the Cartoon \u201cHong Kong Phooey\u201d [3] The song actually was a minor hit in Japan. Though apparently in America it was thought the song was about a guy masturbating to a girl\u2019s photograph when it had the refrain \u201cI think I'm turning Japanese\". It was the only song that the Vapors were ever remembered for, so it was not so much racist but more misinterpreted. hough Kristen Dunst did do a cover verison of the song dressed as Japanese Gothic lollita type though I think she may have wanting the whole buffing the vampire slayer thing.

            "answer_text": "Answer: ZERO. The song is about a guy in prison, masturbating to pictures/thoughts of his girlfriend. \u201cTurning Japanese\u201d refers to the way some guys\u2019 faces go squinty at the . . . moment of truth, shall we say. If you want to call that racist, then you have a lot more issues than the authors of the song. ZERO. ",
