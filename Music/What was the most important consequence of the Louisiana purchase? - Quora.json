            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with a map then, shall we?  See the gigantic white mass of land, roughly in the middle of the United States? That is, the lands west of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains? The acquisition of that much land at once, for a bargain basement price, from an overextended imperial power (France) unloading a white elephant to a new republic coming into its own as a Great Power (United States) and mastering a continent is the most important consequence.  See how closely the western Mississippi drainage basin mirrors the map of the Louisiana Purchase? Not a coincidence. Permanent control of the Mississippi River Valley as well as control of the international port of New Orleans were of utmost interest to the Jefferson administration. In fact, Jefferson\u2019s goal was originally just to acquire New Orleans. The French surprised his ministers by offering the entirety of Louisiana. Of near primary importance was the village (in 1803) of St. Louis, centrally located at the confluence of Mississippi and Missouri. St. Louis and the nearby Jefferson Barracks army base were the commercial and military capital of the American West until around the late 1870\u2032s when the rivers began to give way to the railroads as the primary conduit for transport. The Great Plains were a place where the Jeffersonian vision of an agrarian republic filled with literate, politically educated yeoman farmers could thrive. Access to the Missouri River and its tributaries enabled exploration, settlement, resource extraction, and commerce to filter in and out of what was then the Far West. Military explorers such as Lewis and Clark used the Missouri and other rivers to reach the Pacific Ocean. The scientific fields of biology, geology, and geography were greatly enhanced by this and other western expeditions. Clearly, the most important consequence to Native American and First Nation peoples of the interior were a coming clash of civilizations and further centuries of genocide, invisibility, and disenfranchisement.

            "answer_text": "On a very personal level, it\u2019s what made my family Americans. In 1765 my ancestor, Firmin Breaux, moved from Acadia all the way down to what is now St Martin Parish in Louisiana. He and some other Acadians bought a bunch of land down there. Firmin built a bridge across the river so people didn\u2019t have to take boats or walk to the next bridge. About a decade later, those English fellows to the east decided they\u2019d had enough of their king and gave him the boot. A couple decades after that was all over, the fledgling country was expanding and France was having some troubles of its own. Even though he had just won it back from Spain 3 years prior, Napoleon knew he couldn\u2019t hold the territory and was worried about another war with England. So he sold the whole damn thing to this new country. With that, he and his children became Americans. The area he settled in was known as Breaux\u2019s Bridge and 50 years after his death, would be incorporated and officially called Breaux Bridge. [1] While he was there, the area was controlled by Spain, then France, then America. Had Spain retained control of it, or if France hadn\u2019t sold it, my family wouldn\u2019t have been Americans.
