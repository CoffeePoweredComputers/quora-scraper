            "answer_text": "It completely depends on the taste you have for music. If you love peppy numbers, there is no dearth of such songs. If you are inclined towards romantic songs, be it slow or packed with beats; Bollywood offers you chock-a-block-full. And if listening to soft music is your choice, you are again spoilt for choices with Hindi songs. It all depends what you find \u201csoothing\u201d as per your mood. However some of my personal favourites are - Surmayi ankhiyon mein (Sadma) Kaun mera (Special 26) Jane kya baat hai (Sunny) Raat akeli hai (Jewel Thief) Chup tum raho (Is raat ki subah nahin) Sawli-si raat (Burfi) Taare hain barati (Virasat) Humein jab se mohabbat (Border) Ae ri pawan (Bemisaal) You can find lyrics of these songs at www.experthindi.com.
