            "answer_text": "Well there\u2019s 1989\u2019s Oh Mercy, which Rolling Stone magazine rated as the 44th best, and Q magazine rated as the 33rd best album of the 80\u2019s (and I\u2019d personally rate much higher). Then there was the platinum-selling Time Out Of Mind in 1997 which won a Grammy award for album of the year (along with two other Grammys) and appeared at 408 in Rolling Stone Magazine\u2019s list of the greatest albums of all time. It was Uncut magazines album of the year and produced Make you Feel My Love, which has been covered by hundreds of artists since. Time Out of Mind peaked at number 10 on the Billboard album charts, every album of original material he\u2019s released since has been a top ten album. Things have changed was released on The Wonder Boys soundtrack in 2000 and won an Oscar for best original music from a motion picture. 2001\u2019s Love and Theft is Rolling Stone\u2019s 385th best album of all time and Glide magazine\u2019s best album of the decade. Entertainment Weekly also said it was one of the best albums of the decade, Newsweek said it was the second best album of the decade. It was nominated for the Album of The Year Grammy and won Best Contemporary folk album. Modern Times (2006) was a Billboard number one seller and Rolling Stone magazines 204th best album of all time, the eighth best album released in the decade and the best album released that year. It won Grammys in the folk and also the rock categories. Together Through Life from 2009 was hastily put together after sessions that were supposed to produce a few songs for a soundtrack ended up producing an entire album. It was still good enough to top the Billboard album charts and pick up two Grammy nominations. 2012\u2019s Tempest only reached number 3 on the Billboard charts which is a comparative low for Bob. It was Rolling Stone\u2019s fourth best album of 2012 and seventh in Wire magazine. So yes, Dylan has released important material since the 1970\u2019s. After a fairly difficult time in the eighties he became a powerful force in contemporary music releasing a string of albums which were all critical and commercial successes. He wasn\u2019t just the best artist of the sixties or seventies, he\u2019s one of the best artists of the nineties and beyond. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh yeah. Tons. At the end of his \u201cChristian\u201d period, which many fans and critics wrongfully dismissed outright, he produced one of his most rockin\u2019 albums, and he sounds passionate and fiery through it all. It\u2019s called Shot of Love, and some of its most treasured tracks include \u201cProperty Of Jesus\u201d, \u201cDead Man, Dead Man\u201d (which has a terrific reggae vibe), \u201cIn the Summertime\u201d, and the glorious \u201cThe Groom\u2019s Still Waitin\u2019 At The Altar.\u201d But that was just a warm-up to one of his best albums, Oh Mercy. This was produced by Daniel Lanois, who\u2019s remastered many careers which seemed to be all but dead. It\u2019s a moody masterpiece, full of atmosphere and foreboding. \u201cMan In The Long Black Coat\u201d and \u201cMost of the Time\u201d are classics. \u201cRing Them Bells\u201d and \u201cShooting Star\u201d are gems that reveal a more reflective, somber Dylan. But then in the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, he found a new identity as a troubadour of world-weariness, heartbreak and death and released a stunning run of new albums. Time Out of Mind is a masterpiece. Every track is deep and soulful. Again, a LaNoise production. From the first track \u201cLove Sick\u201d to the last long (16 min;31 sec) discursive ballad \u201cHighlands\u201d, he forges new territory using the modes of old R & B. The old romantic simmers through in \u201cStanding in the Doorway\u201d and \u201cMake You Feel My Love\u201d, which was covered by Adele. But then his next album Love and Theft expands on the themes laid down in the previous record to great effect. And then he tops himself again with Modern Times. All three of these albums are chockfull of powerful throbbing brooding rockin\u2019 meditations on love and loss, doom and despair. Listen to the tracks of these three fine albums: \u201cWorkingman\u2019s Blues #2\u201d, \u201cNettie Moore\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t Talkin\u201d, \u201cWhen the Deal Goes Down\u201d, \u201cSummer Days\u201d, \u201cLonesome Day Blues\u201d among others in these 3 fine records and you\u2019ll see the bard is back in fine form. It\u2019s like he made up his mind to be a deadly old man with a song. I wouldn\u2019t sniff at Together Through Life either, his follow-up to Modern Times. The tracks here are as tight and well-produced as anything in the prior three albums. \u201cBeyond Here Lies Nothin\u2019\u201d, \u201cForgetful Heart\u201d, \u201cJolene\u201d and \u201cThis Dream of You\u201d are stand-outs. Foot-stomping and rude. Ruminative and blue. He plays the gamut and still keeps things within the range of the American myth. But then he rose to produce one more late masterpiece in Tempest, his last album of new original material. With his band now in tight formation and ready to follow his lead (Dylan produced his last three projects himself as Jack Frost), they keep the beat steady and pulsing through such instant Americana as \u201cDuquesne Whistle\u201d, \u201cLong and Wasted Years\u201d, and \u201cTempest\u201d his 14 minute ballad about the Titanic. And all through the last three decades, he\u2019s released much of his backlog through his Bootleg Series, many of them unreleased previously unheard of tracks or alternate versions of recorded material. Which reminds one of how much he\u2019s actually done, and undone, in a long career spanning 6 decades. SIX. Dylan crafted a new persona for his late years, admitting that his voice was not what it had been before, leaning instead on the power of his lyrics, which are confident and muscular, He continues to create singular music, straddling folk, rock, blues, soul, R&B, and country. He sings about this strange and wondrous event called America at the twilight of its greatness. Which is the twilight of his. (One more mention. \u201cBrownsville Girl\u201d is an epic track from his mid-80s effort Knocked Out Loaded. Co-written with Sam Shepard, it has a sweep and propulsive force that very few songs can match today.) ",

            "answer_text": "Dylan\u2019s albums after 1980 or so are weaker than his earlier work. While on his earlier records one brilliant track follows another, in the later there is a mixture of very strong material with some fillers and often one or more songs which are outright stinkers. And Dylan\u2019s voice has deteriorated badly over the years, so some of his songs he fails to do real justice to. Still, there are some excellent songs in this period, if you wade through the lesser songs and Dylan\u2019s uneven singing. I think the later songs which are by general consensus among his very greatest would be \u201cBlind Willie McTell\u201d and \u201cEvery Grain of Sand\u201d.
