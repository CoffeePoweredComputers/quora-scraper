They obviously were 2\u20133 minutes short, and something very sad had happened during the episode. So they play a sappy song over a montage shot of everyone\u2019s going about his or her day, etc. Other shows picked up on this \u2014 hey, good writers are hard to find \u2014 and this is an easy way out. It\u2019s lazy and adds nothing to the story. ",

            "answer_text": "Music montages are a cheap way of injecting drama into a scene or sequence. They tend to be overdone in most shows and movies. There are many shows which use them at the end of every single episode in order to emotionally wrap up the show. It\u2019s a tried and true concept, and is often used when the show is struggling to have real drama \u2014 so they use fake drama in its place. ",
