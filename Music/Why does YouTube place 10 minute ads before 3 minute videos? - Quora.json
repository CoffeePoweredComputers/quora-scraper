The advertiser running video campaigns in Google Ads (thus running ads on YouTube for the most part) has the ability to select which targeting options they would like to use to showcase their video ad. The advertiser also gets to select which one of their YouTube videos will be part of that ad campaign. It is 100% purely up to the advertiser to choose which video to show. ",
