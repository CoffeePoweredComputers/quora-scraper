            "answer_text": "Oh yes, a few times. Thank goodness the rest of them were so humble. But there\u2019s always a jerk that comes along, so\u2026. There was this one tenor that thought he was so good. He hit the wrong note in one broadway song, and during rehearsals, I had to whisper to him that he was flat. He looked at me like I was just garbage. He said, \u2018I was NOT flat.\u2019 I smiled and told him Oh yeah? Let\u2019s touch the piano keys and find out, shall we?\u2019 I gently pressed Bb, and sure enough, as clear as day, he was singing an A, NOT a Bb. He couldn\u2019t look me in the eye. I patted his shoulder gently and said, \u2018 I think we\u2019re a bit exhausted. Let\u2019s take a 15-minute break and try again.\u2019 He did so well in the actual performance. And attitude-wise, he was so much pleasant to deal with. Another instance was with a trio that looked down at us. This group sang jazz and was from a famous university in our country. But the way they treated the staff was very disrespectful and too condescending. So when the time came for rehearsals, oboy\u2026..we didn\u2019t even pay much attention to them. They needed better sounding mikes, our boys were taking a break at the back. When they asked for a cue, it was MY turn to eat lunch. We made them wait for over an hour. My boss was laughing at the backstage. when I came back, the trio was looking so crestfallen. I said, \u2018Oh, were you going to rehearse? Ok\u2026all of it? We have to test the lights and sounds first, maybe you could come back after one more hour? Thank you.\u2019 My boss almost dropped on the floor, laughing. If there is one thing we can\u2019t stand, it\u2019s disrespect. Moral lesson? BE NICE to the production staff and coaches, or else you will never survive your performance. Talk about being a real bitch. But trust me, the trio shaped up, learned to say please, and we fully supported those three knuckleheads that night. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, I\u2019ve come across several - and it\u2019s really frustrating. The vast majority seem to be guitarists! They think they know everything; they rattle off how good they are/harbour an attitude of superiority - when in actual fact they are just soulless hacks. Every now and then I\u2019ve sensed an attitude of \u2018Who\u2019s this bass player trying to tell ME what to do?\u2019, totally regardless of the fact that in most cases I could play guitar better than them. I was in a band several years ago where I had to show these 2 guitarist (who reckoned they were really into the Blues) the chords to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cYou Shook Me All Night Long\u201d! One guitarist I was in a band with (great lead player - hamfisted on rhythm) presented to me (on bass) a chord chart for a relatively simple song; I questioned 1 chord in particular that was just wrong, and of course he shrugged it off - almost condescendingly. But I stuck to my guns & insisted on playing the original song to make my point. Upon my being correct, he just let out an aggressive grunt. Then there was another guitarist auditioning for a band last night; for a start, he played the wrong riff to \u201cCry In Shame\u201d (cover from Aussie band Bondi Cigars). I showed him the riff & he made some idle excuse (\u2018harmony of the riff\u2019?). THEN he had to read Ben Harper\u2019s \u201cSteal My Kisses\u201d from his iPhone! He missed the F chord where it goes from G-Gb-F! When I pointed that out to him. Nice guy, but seemingly too cocksure. I find it amusing and sad as a member of the rhythm section that I often have to put guitarists in their place/s. ",

She couldn\u2019t write a song to save herself and her ego was big enough to encompass a large auditorium. One day in rehearsal she kept bragging how great she was and I got tired of it. I told her to her face that she wasn\u2019t that good and if she was that good, she should leave the group and go out on her own. She did. A few years later I heard she was homeless. Recently she passed away. I still remember the good times we had when we recorded our album. ",

            "answer_text": "This is actually fairly common; many musicians go through a phase of being overly impressed with themselves (and some never grow out of it). Many musicians also go through phases of intense self-doubt, thinking themselves and their music to be worthless. Sometimes, these even happen to the same person in different stages of their musical growth. Being able to find confidence is good. Being able to keep it as confidence and not let it become arrogance is also good. But most of us have at one point or another fallen off that balance line. ",

This even applies to conductors and concert soloists; I\u2019ve heard some funny stories about them, but it\u2019s never been my own experience. ",
