I\u2019ve also seen American (English speaking) productions of Chicago and West Side Story that toured to Japan. I also work in entertainment over here and and perform in musical theatre style shows that are very popular to Japanese audiences. All of my theatre experiences have been full houses! Audiences definitely react differently over here though than at home. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite popular, actually. Theatre in Japan always started with the Kabuki-cho. The Kabuki theatre still stands today, and if you ever get the chance, go see these incredible productions. In terms of more Western style musicals, Japan has seen Japanese productions of some of the finest, including Wicked, Phanton of the Opera, and recently Miss Saigon, among others. ",
