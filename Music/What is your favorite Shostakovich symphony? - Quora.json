The boldly experimental No. 4 holds a special fascination for me. Nos 5 & 10 are justly popular works on a grand scale. The dark and brooding #8 and the sassy and sarcastic #9 make compelling contrast. 15 is just an amazing final essay in the form\u2014a sort of a \u201ccatch me if you can\u201d symphony. This piece seems to be saying, at least to me: \u201cYou may think you understand DSCH, but you don\u2019t. He\u2019s always one step ahead of you.\u201d 13 and 14 are powerful treatments of poetic texts. I suppose my favorite among these is the one I\u2019m listening to at the moment. I just finished hearing #15, in a performance by the composer\u2019s son Maxim and the Prague Symphony Orchestra. Hear Maxim (or anyone) if you can in this catch-me-if-you-can symphony.  ",

            "answer_text": "8. A total monster of a piece. One of the bleakest pieces ever composed. In that rare class of pieces that after you know it, just feels like every single note is utterly critical and if it were a second shorter or longer, the whole thing might collapse. Written as the war accelerated to even darker places, the center of the piece (the 3rd movement) is manic, full of rounds and motion, but ultimately dissolves into 2 more movements of intense darkness. Shostakovich was criticized for making 7 an upbeat ode to the win at Stalingrad. 8 pretty much shuts that down hard. ",

The 4th is also strong with me, and I have soft spots for 11 and 12. Having said that an honourable mention goes to No 6 which has far more in its three movement frame than is at first apparent. I enjoy 8 and 9 but do not care much for 2, 3, 13, 14 or 15 - though I can listen to them if no other Shostakovich symphony is available. ",
