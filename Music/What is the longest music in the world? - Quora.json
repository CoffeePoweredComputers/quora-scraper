            "answer_text": "Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke composes the longest recorded song in history Radiohead\u2018s Thom Yorke has broken the record of longest song ever recorded with his most recent 432 hour long creation, \u201cSubterranea.\u201d Yorke composed this 18 day long masterpiece to be the enveloping soundtrack for his artist friend and collaborator, Stanley Donwood\u2019s exhibition The Panic Office held in Sydney, Australia. Donwood displays the influential and potent role he has played in the artistic success of Radiohead by showcasing the original album artwork he has designed for them over the past 21 years of collaboration. According to Billboard, \u201cSubterranea\u201d is \u201cbuilt from 25, 920 unique minutes of atmospheric, experimental sounds\u201d all of which have been solely and strategically produced to run for the length of Donwood\u2019s exhibit which began May 21 and ended June 6. The mysteriously rare exhibition has come to an end, leaving us to fantasize and imagine the momentous experience of booming music and stimulating artwork. Unfortunately for the Radiohead fans of the world, there are no current plans to release the record breaking track to the public. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the longest piece I\u2019ve personally heard of. Though it could be argued that all sound could be sonic-ally considered music. So, I suppose it\u2019s possible the longest piece started before we measured time and is still playing. Lifted from Wiki Organ\u00b2/ASLSP (As Slow as Possible) is a musical piece by John Cage and the subject of one of the longest-lasting musical performances yet undertaken. It was originally written in 1987 for organ and is adapted from the earlier work ASLSP 1985; a typical performance of the piano version lasts 20 to 70 minutes. [1] In 1985, Cage opted to omit the detail of exactly how slowly the piece should be played. The performance of the organ version at St. Burchardi church in Halberstadt, Germany, began in 2001 and is scheduled to have a duration of 639 years, ending in 2640.
