            "answer_text": "You can plug your headphones into your guitar, but you are right. No one will be able to hear you play. Not even you. The pick ups do not produce enough signal to drive even the little speakers in your headphones on their own. You will need at least a little bit of amplifier. Many regular amps have a headphone jack exactly for this purpose. It cuts off the main speaker when you use it. Or there are tiny little amps that plug into your guitar without a cable, which dont even have a speaker. They are made to produce just enough power to be a headphone amp. The one i have is powered by a couple of small batteries Of course if you are playing a hollow body, or an acoustic-electric, you will still make quite a bit of sound naturally. To be realy quiet, you will want a solid body guitar. ",

One day I decided to find out what my acoustic/electric guitar sounded like unplugged, and using the hearing aid\u2026\u2026.BABY, WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!!!,it amplifies the sound and puts it right in yer ear, and BEST PART??? You are playing TOTALLY un-amplified, the sound in your ear is GREAT, and you\u2019re not disturbing anyone else!! PS, DON\u2019T run the volume on the hearing aid too high, it can really hurt if it\u2019s too high.  ",

            "answer_text": "One reason, besides power (if you are plugging directly into the 1/4 jack on the instrument, electric or hybrid) is that the output is intended to drive a high impedance input, 10,000 Ohms or more- think of it as high pressure- you don\u2019t need a lot of signal strength to work. Headphones are usually around 4 Ohms- the difference between the 1/4 jack and the headphones completely tanks the signal. The ear type headphones for cells may have a much higher impedance (less power for the cell to use) and might work- if you don\u2019t mind awful sound. There are in-ear wired sets that are electrically like headphones, and sound like good headphones too. ",
