            "answer_text": "Lucifer, of course. Even the name \u201cilluminati\u201d was derived in reference to him. Lucifer actually means \u201cthe light bearer\u201d or \u201cbringer of light\u201d. The illuminati are those illuminated by the light of Lucifer. The heads of the illuminati deal directly with Lucifer and get their orders from none other than Lucifer himself. Also, the illuminati are barely human, if at all. They're vehicles for demonic entities. Basically, demons are ruling the world. Not people. The illuminati all hail from an aristocratic lineage of Jews, going all the way back to the ancient world. A pharaonic bloodline, perpetuated through the centuries. Their blood makes them easier to be fully possessed by demons. Their blood is infused with demonic energy, from birth. I'm not gonna delve into the aspect of demon/human copulation in too much detail, but just to give you the general idea.. When a couple have sex, jinn often partake in the act, and should a baby be conceived, there's a high chance that it will be part jinn. Now imagine continuous interbreeding between these \u201cpart jinn\u201d bloodlines. Well it's actually deeper. When demonically possessed individuals copulate, the result is very different compared to when jinn partake in the act of sex between normal people. You guys ever watch the movie Rosemary\u2019s baby? That isn't a work of fiction, and that kinda stuff actually happens. It's more rife than you might think. So we're talking about a bloodline, bred and perfected to facilitate demonic possession. That's why the illuminati only marry within the family. They're all related somewhere down the line. Apologies for being vague, but I hope you guys get the gist of what I'm saying. It sounds crazy, I know, but that doesn't make it any less true. Bottom line, the illuminati are actually a bunch of demonic hybrids. Right at the top, you'll find fully fledged demons, and above them all, you'll find Lucifer himself. The antichrist has his hand in all this too, of course. Lucifer and the antichrist are in cahoots. It's like the dj duo faithless say in their hit track, we come one\u2026 \u201cI'm the left eye, you're the right. Would it not be madness to fight, we come one, one, one\u2026\u201d Antichrist is actually a demon which operates within a human host. That's his modus operandi. He might already be in his final form by now, and I'm sure the illuminati have already been in contact with him for some time. So, in conclusion, that's who you'll find right at the top\u2026 Satan and the antichrist. They're the leaders of the illuminati. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suspect that the Illuminati would operate very similar to the secret order in the X Files. An imitation of a god like force of people, god like in the sense that they are mysterious and invisible to the naked eye but in plain sight. Maneuvering people, companies, stock markets, terrorist organisations, religious groups, all facets of societies as much as possible to their agenda collectively and individually. Mostly they would succeed in their maneuvers, sometimes work with an outcome not of their making to the best scenario for them to continue and occasionally have to deal with situations or people aggressively to achieve their desired results, 9/11 possibly, Kennedy another possibility and many more. I would suspect that there is no set leader rather a mutual respect, in that each other could have each other killed if a threat was perceived to their respective fortunes and position within the institution. Morals would not be in their respective dictionaries so family is just a word, yet favor would play a strong influence with one another, group within the group for a time, then return to one collective idea. Any group not in their favor would be classified as lets say a terrorist group, publicly declared one, attacked as one, imitated to raise more support globally, allowed entry to a country as known threat to the community in order to bolster patriotism, patriotism then used to change laws for more control of the masses. Puppeteer the puppeteer.    Religion would be a crucial tool used on the masses as since man has been able to walk, he has had a religion and used it to control the masses of his immediate people. Fear of a god that will strike one down or even a community if necessary like a Zeus is the perfect puppeteers god. A God like Jesus Christ is the outright worst type to the institution as a brotherly love concept would counteract their control of the masses and severely weaken their position in the community, regardless of their wealth. The idea that all are accountable to the same rules and laws is detestable to them as arrogance is the strings that make them a puppet. The false delusional freedom preached by them would be overrun with real community freedom putting their fortunes and powerful selfish influence on a guillotine. They would actually have to be apart of a community. Fancy that. ",
