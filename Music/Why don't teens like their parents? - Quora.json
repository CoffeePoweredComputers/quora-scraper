            "answer_text": "Before I begin, please know that in no way at all am I trying to \u201cgarner sympathy\u201d, or make anyone feel bad for me. I am also not embellishing. I can\u2019t stand my mother and my father, but I can\u2019t decide which one I can\u2019t stand more (if that makes sense). I guess I\u2019ll start with my mom. My mom and I have an extremely tedious relationship. She rages, literally flips out over every. little. thing. For example, this was a week ago. We were going to Costco, and anyone that has been to Costco knows that it\u2019s always extremely cold. Where I live, it was about 90 degrees with a breeze, so even though jeans might\u2019ve not been the best idea for that weather, considering I was going to Costco (the Antarctica of all stores), I slipped on some jeans and a light jacket. My mother sees what I\u2019m wearing, yells at me for half an hour about \u201cmy clothes being so overboard\u201d and when I try to say that I only wore it because we were going to Costco, she slaps me. Tiny little things like that set my mom totally on a rampage that always results in me being hit. She also abuses me verbally. I made the mistake of coming out to my parents as gay, and they are one step away from kicking me out of the house because of it. She, even more than my dad, bombards me with insults regarding gay stereotypes, and tells me that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want a fag fairy child.\u201d The stress that my mother puts on me mentally is awful, but my father is almost definitely the worse of the pair, now that I think of it. My father hits me. Not with his hand, or a shoe, with a heavy, bison hide belt. Like what sets my mother off, my dad goes off with the tiniest things as well. He tries to initiate political arguments with me all the time, and I don\u2019t have the time or the energy to argue with him 24/7, so I try to disengage. One time, I told him \u201cI\u2019m not gonna argue with you again.\u201d He comes over to me and yells at me about \u201cbeing a disrespectful little shit\u201d, then slaps me in the face and literally breaks my glasses, he hit me so hard. The hitting me for no reason has gotten to the point where I am literally afraid of him. The worst time of my life, even worse than hearing that my brother had died, was when I was beaten, **BEATEN** with that bison belt my father loves so much. I got to count as he hit me, and I will always, ALWAYS remember that he hit me 37 times across my entire body. Why, you may ask? Because there was garbage on the floor of my bedroom. A year later, I still have body cramps and spasms at night, where my muscles contract so tightly all at once that I can\u2019t even scream. On top of it all, I have no one at all to talk to about it. I\u2019m terrified of my friends not wanting to be associated with me, I trust my friends, and at heart I know they wouldn\u2019t leave me, but how do you bring up your abusive parents in a conversation. Why do I hate my parents? Because not only have they scarred every last part of my soul, but because they have made me feel alone. Edit: My situation has gotten no better. Every day I am grateful for the opportunity to escape my real life and go to school, where I can be happy; be myself. I\u2019m so tired of being sad and feeling alone. 9/22/2019 ",

            "answer_text": "It's not that we don't like our parents, god, no. My mom is one of the only people on this Earth that I wouldn't hesitate to fight or die for. The problem is much like many others have stated, they don't understand us. Hear me out. \"You don't understand me, Mom!\" Such an overused, cliched phrase, yet it rings true in some cases. Teens and adults clash, like all children do with their parents. That's not a phenomenon, only now, it gets much worse a reputation. Our brains are changing: sometimes it's scary to realize you're getting older, and fear is one of the main reasons teens act out. That, and the need for individuality. See, the different between adults and teenagers is that parents have had time to become their own person and teenagers are just barely starting to. Adults have individuality, teens want it. That's why teenagers \"rebel,\" for lack of a better word. We want to be something other than what school or society has trained us to be, and so reject social norms and become angsty, sometimes disrespectful, mini-adults. Not only is our brain chemistry changing, so is the world around us. Many current parents-of-teenage-children grew up without technology until their adulthood, but my generation was born right into it. The way people think is changing, what's deemed acceptable has evolved for the better, yet many adults are still stuck in their own parents' mindset. My generation is brilliant, and we are changing the world even as kids. We are progressive and loving and loyal, yet we get our ideas shot down because they're seen as \"too revolutionary\" or \"pandering.\" TLDR: So, yeah, our parents don't understand us, and we really don't understand them. It's not that we dislike the adults in our life, we dislike their out-of-date ideas about us. ",
