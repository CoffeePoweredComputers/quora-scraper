It's music was endearing and retro-style, basically covers of popular melodies. I could not find any official name to the music played during various instances of the game but I did find a way you can contact Eric Froemling who is open to questions such as yours. His twitter: Eric Froemling (@EricFroemling) on Twitter The Bombsquad feedback and questions feed: support@froemling.net Hope this helped! ",
