            "answer_text": "I find the easiest is to use a C shape, barred up 4 frets. That results in 4,4,4,7Which can be easily converted to an E7 by moving to 4,4,4,5, with a few other little fill notes easily within reach. One of the nice things about using this shape is that you can make all sorts of chords simply by moving it up and down the neck. Your pinkie (the \"7\" in the E version) is on the root, the fundamental, and gives the name of the chord. You can go all the way up to an A chord (9,9,9,12) for a little different bright sound for an A chord. THAT BEING SAID....Practice every way you can find to play an E chord! They will all have a slightly different sound. Not every way is best for every song. Sometmes, one is easier because of the chords before/after, sometimes just the variety helps spice things up. But the more ways you know, the more interesting your playing can be. Once you have a pretty good handle on the chords in the \"open\" position (A, D, C, G, F and a few others) see what happens as you move those shapes up and down the neck.See where you just have to put down one more string to make it sound good, or at least, sound interesting! And have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Apart from practicing until you can play it, there is a method I use with some of my students that have large hands and fingers and small ukuleles. This may seem like a lot of work but it made things easier for me. I have at least one or two of my ukulele\u2019s strung upside down. I discovered this when I was a child and I couldn\u2019t fit my fingers on the narrow frets of the ukulele that I owned. It means that I use a bar to play what my 2nd, 3rd and 4th fingers normally play on the fourth fret and my first finger plays the note on the second fret. My fingers fit more easily with this arrangement than it does in standard tuning. I prefer that chord voicing to having a bar on the fourth fret in standard tuning and using another finger to fret the seventh fret. There are issues with other chord shapes when playing a ukulele strung upside down, but they just require adjusting your fingering rather than getting a ukulele with wider frets. Hope this helps. ",
