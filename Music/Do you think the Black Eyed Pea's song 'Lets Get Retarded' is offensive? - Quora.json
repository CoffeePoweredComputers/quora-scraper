            "answer_text": "I almost passed on answering this question, because I know it will be impossible for me to give an unbiased answer. Not only do I rather enjoy the song, but it brings back very fond memories of my early childhood\u2014 and I don\u2019t have very many of those. So, with that in mind, let\u2019s dive in to my (unqualified and completely subjective) opinion. I think the word \u201cretard\u201d is offensive. I don\u2019t like to use it, and I generally don\u2019t like hearing other people use it, either. Inheretly, I would say the song\u2019s use of the word is \u201coffensive\u201d, at least to some degree. Do I think it\u2019s a big deal, though? Well\u2026 not particularly. For one, there was obviously no mailice or intentional discrimination against any group. The song does not mock or condemn people who are mentally handicapped at all\u2014 in fact, it doesn\u2019t even mention them. When they say \u201cLet\u2019s get retarded\u201d, they\u2019re talking about getting high and/or drunk. This was common slang for those activities at the time. People who suffer from intellectual or cognitive disabilities are not mentioned in the song at all. It\u2019s also worth nothing that the song doesn\u2019t actually call anyone retarded, or use it as a slur. If the lyrics had said something like \u201cxxx is retarded\u201d or \u201cxxx is a retard\u201d, I may have had more of a problem with it. As it stands, though, they were using the term only to describe themselves (\u2018let\u2019s get retarded\u2019, versus \u2018we are retarded\u2019). I\u2019m not saying that excuses the use of the word, but I felt it worth pointing out that it was not used in the context of a slur, or as an insult towards any person or group. And lastly\u2026 I just feel, frankly, like there are too many more important issues to worry about it. There are still people who are openly hateful and discriminatory towards those who are mentally handicapped. The standard of living for somebody with a severe intellectual disability is exceptionally poor in the US, especially if they do not have family to take care of them. Very few jobs are willing to hire them, and they have an unprecedented amount of homelessness, with an estimated 20\u201325% of homeless individuals suffering from some form of mental illness or intellectual disability (compared to only 6% of non-homeless people). This is in addition to the malicious bullying and, in some cases, assault that they\u2019re sometimes forced to endure. Compared to that, a 15 year old song that uses a rude word just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth getting upset about. Anyway, that\u2019s my two cents on the issue, but I\u2019m fully aware and understanding of why some people feel upset and/or offended at the song\u2019s word choice. ",

Edit: It was pointed out to me that it was originally not called let\u2019s get it started, which I didn\u2019t know. Thanks for pointing that out to me. I think that the answer would be yes or at least maybe that it would be offensive as they eventually changed the name of it. Sorry if the original answer seemed sort of snippy on my part as you were entirely correct and I was the one that had it wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on who you ask. For some it will be, for others it will not be. Use of the word retarded has become controversial because it is seen as mean and derogatory and even a slur against an entire group of people. However, I hope we will move away from this hyper sensitivity where everything must be confronted or retaliated against or exposed as a dramatic evil. I believe that the best way to deal with those who express viewpoints that you strongly dislike or say things that you strongly disagree with is to simply ignore them and not associate with them. Anything much more is just unnecessary. You might try a persuasive argument to convince the person that you are right but that is usually pointless in my experience. ",
