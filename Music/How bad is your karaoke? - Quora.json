            "answer_text": "Depends on the song, when I am up, where in the rotation I am, and how much I have practiced. I like to start out with something easy to clear out the pipes, and maybe push away any latent jitters. But catch me by surprise by a song that\u2019s a little more out of my wheelhouse and a bit scary, and it could be very bad indeed. But no matter how bad or good I am, there are always better and worse people along the spectrum. Also I feel it incumbent upon myself when I start to take things too seriously to sing songs that are meant just to be fun. For me it is the \u201cLove Boat\u201d theme. I turn up the Ham and Cheese factor for that one. I also have to relate this story, as it is fresh in my memory. One night at a family restaurant that does karaoke on Saturday nights, I sang \u201cRainbow Connection\u201d as it should be sung, in the voice of Kermit. As a kid, I loved this song and worked on my Kermit impression for hours upon hours\u2026okay maybe just hours. The reception was polite applause. Later I was told by this girl that I was to, by no means, ever sing that song again. She did not like it. I was like fine whatever and I thought that was the end of it. But a couple weeks ago she mentioned it again. \u201cDon\u2019t sing that song again.\u201d So my reply was \u201cchallenge accepted, I shall sing regular songs in Kermit\u2019s voice.\u201d My guess is this is exactly what she didn\u2019t want and by her response I could tell that it was true. So now I do have an ace in the hole. Someday, sometime, when she least expects it, Kermit is going to sing something\u2026it could be today, tomorrow, or in the weeks and months to come. I also told her, \u201cThere are many things in this life I don\u2019t like and don\u2019t feel the need to tell others I don\u2019t like them. My belief is to \u201clive and let live.\u201d I then moved in closer and said in almost a stage whisper, \u201cFor instance, I am not too fond of Country Music, yet I would not in any way impose my will on others, because who am I in the big scheme of things?\u201d As a resident of the south I have had to deal with country music for 52 years, and that\u2019s good, it teaches me that thankfully we are all different, it takes all kinds, and it\u2019s a constant reminder that if the world did revolve around me, then I am a masochist.
