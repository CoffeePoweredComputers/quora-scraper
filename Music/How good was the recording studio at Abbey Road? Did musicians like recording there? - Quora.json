            "answer_text": "Was? It\u2019s still there, you know\u2026 Also, its \u2018Abbey\u2019 Road Abbey Road isn\u2019t just ONE studio. There are SIX rooms in total, I think I\u2019m right in saying. The most famous BY FAR and no doubt the one you\u2019re referring to is Studio Two: Studio Two - Abbey Road Studios  It\u2019s famous primarily because of the Beatles, but there have been LOADS of other great records made there: most notably Dark Side of The Moon. These days, you don\u2019t get many (read:zero) bands with the sort of budget to hire such a huge space (although Studio One is even bigger, and used mostly for orchestral film score recordings. Consequently, some of Abbey Road\u2019s biggest clients are instead commercial music library companies, who tend to have higher budgets and the genuine need to justify the space. I have recorded in Studio Two a few times, and engineered once, with mixed feelings about the results. The main reason is the sheer size of the space results in a 1.5ish second reverb time completely naturally. The first session was for a mid-sized choral group of around 20. The ambient reverb suited the style well, so this was a good application. The second, however, was a rather brief affair with a group of young band mates who wanted to record a single song LIVE in a sole hour\u2019s session. This was a terrible idea for so many reasons, but primarily because they didn\u2019t take into account the effect the room\u2019s ambience would have on the recording (HINT: Not Great). They would have been better off in the smaller Studio Three. What\u2019s more, by being so fast in and out they were unable to take advantage of my FAVOURITE thing about Abbey Road: The Gear Room. Abbey Road has the most awe-inspiring collection of vintage, well-maintained analogue outboard gear I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s like a sound engineer\u2019s wet dream. They also have a VAST collection of Tape Machines. The desks in all three of the main studios are great and I\u2019m pretty sure they have an SSL Duality in one of the others, which I\u2019d love to have a play with at some point (It\u2019s a \u00a3200k-ish desk that also controls pro tools, in case you were wondering). In short, Abbey Road is a wonderful collection of studios with inspiring heritage, great equipment and sounds great for certain things. You should always pick the studio to suit the style of music, not the other way around. ",

I also used to know their former Chief Engineer, Haydn Bendall, though I haven\u2019t seen him for many years. The studios are amazing, the gear legendary, the staff ubertalented, and there is a definite aura to the place. I\u2019d love to do a project there! ",
