            "answer_text": "As an avid Queen I find it hard to believe that some people don\u2019t see the greatness of this song. But I\u2019ll gladly take an opportunity to talk about Queen and Bohemian Rhapsody. One of best thing about Bohemian Rhapsody is the pure genius behind it. The way Freddie Mercury was able to take three songs he was working on that weren\u2019t even the same genre and put them together and have them flow so well is true genius. Then there is the lyrics\u2026 the lyrics are the perfect mix of coherent and vague where you get clues as to what it may be about but nothing is set in stone. It allows each listener to determine what the song is about to them making it that much more personal for every person that listens to it. Queen is composed of four of the most talented musicians ever (in my opinion) and Bohemian Rhapsody is one of their most remembered songs (hence the name of the movie). Aside from the reasons I\u2019ve listed there are numerous more because everyone sees different things in music. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say it is because the song is and was so different from anything else on the radio at the time Queen broke all the rules with this song It was over three minutes which was the standard play time on radio- also it was very operatic who heard of a song that sounded like an opera on pop radio It also changed tempo many times throughout the song which meant the beat changed from a ballad to a rock sound all in the same tune ",
