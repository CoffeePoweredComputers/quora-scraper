            "answer_text": "Ibanez is my all time favorite brand of electric guitar and they earned that spot for one simple reason. Quality control. Period. It does not matter what level of guitar you\u2019re buying from them. Whether it\u2019s an entry Level, a medium price point or a high end professional level instrument with all the bells and whistles they maintain the same level of quality and excellence all the way down the line. I would feel supremely confident recommending them over any other brand especially at the entry level or medium level price point simply because they do not lapse on their dedication to build quality, playability or feel even on their cheaper instruments like most other companies do. Their consistency across the spectrum is unparalleled. There is no competition in this specific regard. Now, the reason I did not mention their higher end models is not because they lack quality. They do not. It\u2019s because other companies finally catch up to them at this level due to the prioritization of their higher end models. This has a lot to do with the efficiency of their manufacturing process which I won\u2019t bore you by explaining but to answer your question. In my opinion. Ibanez ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely, it is Yamaha but why? Because it is the brand that is providing some of the industry top guitars in India. Everyone is preferring Yamaha instead of any other guitar. but Ibanez is also competing Yamaha models. Moreover, Professional guitarists are using Ibanez guitars instead of Yamaha. Ibanez and Yamaha's guitars are good but the prices are too high. If you cant afford these guitars then I have a good option for you. With the same features, build quality, and sound you will get a far better yet affordable option.
