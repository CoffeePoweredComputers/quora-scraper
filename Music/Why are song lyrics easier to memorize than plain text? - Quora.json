I can sing lyrics in languages i dont speak that i had learned 40+ years ago, but do i remember the specific 3-word phrase i need to include in a contract?? Yikes. I think the rhythms and melodic phrases of songs provide memory jigs and, of course, the syllables in the lyric must fit the notes of the music. Virtually all song lyrics are, or have many characteristics of poetry such as rhyming patterns and stanza structure. And then there\u2019s muscle memory in the breath and vocal aparatus from repetition. My tongue will never forget how it wrapped itself around the ls in the words \u201cAll'alba vincer\u00f3!\u201c in the climax of Nessun Dorma. ",
