When a song has been recorded and distributed to the public in the U.S. under the authority of the copyright owner, anyone may, by complying with a few simple provisions, obtain a compulsory license to record that song. Such provisions are: 1. The person recording the song must serve notice on the copyright owner, and; 2. The person recording the song must pay the copyright owner the statutory mechanical license rate, which is 9.1 cents per song per recording sold, and; 3. Royalties shall be paid monthly, and; 4. The recording may reflect the style and interpretation of the recording artist, but it may not change the basic melody, the words or the fundamental character of the song. (U.S. Copyright Act, Section 115) COVER IN PERFROMANCE. Generally a singer may cover another\u2019s song in live performance. The venue is generally responsible for paying ASCAP, BMI and SESAC, which, presumably, account to the songwriter(s). SAMPLING.

            "answer_text": "When someone performs a song, the songwriter gets a cut of the licensing fees the venue pays. Even if this is their own song. This is handled by ASCAP. http://www.ascap.com/licensing/licensingfaq.aspx When a recording artist makes a record, they have to negotiate directly with the songwriter to do their cover. Samples, in the U.S., require permission from the recording artist and the songwriter (easy when they are the same person). Theyight demand a licensing fee, royalties, or just credit. Its up to them, there is no official mechanism for this. Its really no different than buying use of the entire song, which is a huge burden for sampler artists like Girl Talk. Generally they say screw it and don't license, but give their work away for free so there is nothing financial to gain from suing. And still they get sued. But only by the biggest artists. http://www.mtv.com/news/1484938/producer-of-the-grey-album-jay-z-beatles-mash-up-gets-served/ ",
