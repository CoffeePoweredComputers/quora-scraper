            "answer_text": "I have noticed that sometimes the songs sound slightly out of runs, but then when I listen properly the song isn't actually out of runs with itself but possibly slightly flat or sharp in totality. I can't answer this question with the definitive reason for this, but I can offer some ideas on why this may be. The guitars are tuned to a slightly different calibre than on the recordings. This isn't necessarily a full or half step (though I do suspect that some live recordings have the guitars tuned to Eb), but enough for a noticeable difference. Possibly because it is easier for James to sing to this tuning. The S&M aalbum was in Eb because this is the tuning that was easiest to work with with the orchestra.The room or arena in which they play creates the illusion that the songs are \u2018slightly off'. Sound waves don't always behave perfectly. The sound engineers of metallica have an extremely difficult job in tuning the room before performance but may sometimes get it slightly off. Though I doubt that they would get it wrong. They would be extremely well trained in their field of work.Live performance can never be exactly the same as a polished recording. If it does sound the same the performance probably isn't really live.The audience makes the music sound different through their singing along and cheering.This list is just stuff that I'm thinking of on the spot. My best bet would be the first thing I said\u2026 that the entire band is tuned either sharp or flat. It is the only thing that really makes sense to me because the music is completely in tune with itself but still sounds wrong to my ears. ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who has played in several bands and also recorded many songs I can give you a simple answer. The studio is a controlled environment where each person lays down their part for the songs. It is mixed and any problem can be be corrected. They can even speed the songs up to make it sound higher or slow it down as well. They can also add effects so it will generally never sound the same live. This is true not only with Metallica but with many groups. Oddly enough some groups sound better live. REO Speedwagon and Bob Seger generally sou better live as their songs sounded richer and warmer.
