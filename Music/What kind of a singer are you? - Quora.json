            "answer_text": "Ooooooh, loaded question!!  i have taken 8 years of voice and currently am in a classic rock band. I am somewhat ashamed that at the band\u2019s average age i don't like saying that we were doing this stuff when it was top 40! But I have done professional theater for years, lead in a pre-Broadway musical but my favorite role was Fanny Brice in Funny Girl! My preference is the classic rock genre, but my song writing style goes from country to rock. Our group was selected by Tampa Bay Times music critic (who I think hated every band) but there was readership of 3 million, as one of the 14 album of the years and said we were the Bays answer to Fleetwood Mac. A European critic gave the album 4 stars, which was more than he gave to Kelly Clarkson and Maroon 5! Not too shabby for our first CD of predominantly originals and produced for a total of 5k. Big band was fun for a few years and many of the guys played with Glen Miller, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Stan Kenton, Buddy Rich working with Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Helen O'Connell. It was wonderful to have their experiences with these singers. If I couldn't get a handle on a song, the guys were right there with advice like, \u201cwell, when we recorded this song with Doris Day, this is how she handled that section.\u201d. I think that is really where I learned about phrasing and breathing into the song, and the working knowledge those guys had was invaluable! !! What did I learn from all these different influences? To me every song is a one act play, with an expose of conflict, working on the situation of the character in the song, and at the end, determining the resolution of the song and the emotional response of the audience to the song story. Guess I have rambled on enough. I hope this answers your question! ",

            "answer_text": "I started singing & parroting famous singers as a small child(age 2 actually, couldn\u2019t say the words correctly sometimes, but could repeat the melody). Was always in music class & choir, 1st Chair\u2026.Won Many talent contests in elementary ,Jr/Senior High, & as an adult. Started classical training in voice a few months before I turned 15, & continued for 12years, even saw my teacher back in 2009 for a refresher( & she was 90!).Won Regional & State UIL competitions, sophomore, junior & senior Yrs in solo voice, 3 Gold Medals in HS. Was in professional Musical Theatre by 16. Offered 3 music scholarships in voice. Sang lead & bkng vocals + percussions w/some basic keyboard, in my first cover band by 19, touring US, Mexico & Europe. Sang anything from Cheryl Lynn to Fleetwood Mac, to Loretta Lynn to Streisand. I\u2019ve been doing Streisands\u2019 voice since I was 9, & Stevie\u2019s voice since 19. I\u2019m a Lyric Soprano, classically trained,with a solid 5 octave range(age has dropped it a few notes from 5 1/2 octaves).I became a Streisand Tribute Artist in the \u201890s, after I was approached in a Vegas club by a producer, who remarked on my resemblance to Barbara & asked if I could sing like her, I said \u201cfunny you should ask\u201d, & he asked me to prove it, so I sang right then & there, standing at the bar counter at this club, where I Caused a stir, & he gave me his card said call me, I did, & I\u2019ve worked all over the globe as Barbra, from Vegas, to Puerto Rico, Asia, So. America, & across Europe. I enjoy all kinds of music, but doing Barbra\u2019s is the most fulfilling for me. I enjoy the technical aspects of her music, the lyric etc. There are quite a few videos on youtube. Some I\u2019ve posted, some by others. You can look me up via search Cindy Harrelson as Barbra Streisand, if you\u2019re curious. Cheers! ",

Don\u2019t have the instrument down well enough to sing perfectly in tune\u2026I started too late in life, when I started writing songs with lyrics when I was about 35 or so. I never sang before that, but I had to sing my own songs - I couldn\u2019t expect someone else to it for me. In a studio, with headphones, I can do OK, but singing live with a loud band is tough, \u2019cause you can\u2019t hear yourself well enough over the drums. I don\u2019t have a \u201cpretty\u201d voice either. Sometimes it resembles the sound a sick man makes when he\u2019s puking in the toilet or maybe a man in distress or raging against his plight. But I\u2019m also self critical. ",

It's also hard for me to give a range as I have been hired to sing in a crystal clear soprano voice as well as a raspy whisky alto. I've worked in pop, electronica, hard rock, country, hip hop, classical and musical theatre. So I feel like the versatility is what kept me working. I have sang on children's records replicating a 13 year old only to sing a blues gig the same night. Mostly, I'm a singer who is grateful for the gift. ",

I started singing in 2017 but i never set out wanting to sing! i'm actually just a drummer not a singer! i love music myself, and alway wanted to play in a band, but nobody seemed interested in having a bash at it. So over the past five years or so I started trying to learn the harmonica, also having a go at self teaching some guitar, and now i am singing! I just went on smule app and gave it a go i never thought that would be a good singer by any means i just needed to hear my voice when recorded to a song! So after singing my very first song i just posted it.thats when i got all positive feedback and followers that like my sound. So back to the question, i just have go at singing any song thats infront of me, when singing on smule i dont practice singing songs any invitations to collabs, even songs I never heard before, I sing it and post it after just one take, smile app is great its amazing how easy it is to make recording of a song thats sounds professional in so little time and effort! So again back to the question! I think the listeners should deside as to what kind of singer I am. Thanks, jaykerry2 smule, singer!!. ",

Then I joined a band where I was required to contribute backing vocals - I found that I kinda enjoyed it. Now I perform in a duo and sing 50% lead, I also perform solo playing acoustic guitar and singing. I still consider myself a pretty awful singer with a limited range however I work hard at it and am gradually improving. Occasionally I carefully analyse phrase by phrase what 'real' singers do (eg Van Morrison) to try to understand and emulate their inflections, phrasing and other subtleties - it may not come naturally to me but that doesn't mean I'm going to give up. And recently I've even had some unsolicited compliments about my singing voice - it hasn't changed my opinion but encourages me to continue working at it. I envy real singers .. ",

Now imaging a 170 pound guy, In sleeveless shirt, benching 190 pounds and in the last couple of sets shouts \u201carhh I\u2019m a barbie girl mm \u201d. Hell it was embarrassing. damn. There were a lot of people there, including a couple of girls, one of which I sort of like. They started laughing weirdly as if they have seen dwyane johnson in pink skirt.

Now that doesn't mean I have a weak voice by any means, as I have been able to sing songs that other singers struggle with power wise, its just I lack control that is taught better than picked up. ",

I have sung solos at many weddings and funerals, and many times in church. I have sung big band music with a concert band that was a total blast. I have sung in community choirs and am in one now.
