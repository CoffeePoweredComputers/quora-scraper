            "answer_text": "I strongly recommend getting a real instrument, i.e. a piano! There are aspects of making music that are not conveyed when using a DAW, no matter how good the quality of the synthesizer is. a) The actual touch of a piano's key - this is something that will cost you quite some money when trying to find a keyboard that replicates this even somewhat faithfully. And it is this touch that allows for a tremendous amount of control by the player over the sound coming from the piano. This is where part of the expressiveness of playing piano comes from. And no MIDI-keyboard/synthesizer setup replicates this truly faithfully. b) There is no latency, buffer issues, plug-in crashes or anything like that with a  real instrument. You want your kid to enjoy making music not learning how to fix faulty audio settings and properly routing MIDI signals. You want to afford your kid the opportunity to just \"open the lid and play\" and not having to wait for software to be loaded, etc. It may seem like an insignificant detail but it really is a huge difference having to \"boot your computer and load a DAW\" or simply flipping a lid open and start playing! c) There's a difference between hearing (and feeling!) the sound that comes from a piano and from the speakers of a computer. Just go into a music superstore, and have someone play a piano for you, then walk over to the eMusic section and have someone demonstrate a piano-synthesizer within a DAW to you. I believe you will experience/feel/understand what I mean. And last but not least and not really related to your question: bravo for providing your kid with the opportunity to make music from an early age on! Chances are very good that your child will eventually thank you for this privilege from the bottom of his/her heart. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. :) EDIT:Additional thought: if you're worried about the expense of a piano and whether your kid will \"stick with it\" you can always look into renting a piano for a few months. If your kid loves playing the piano it will probably play it for a long time and the additional expense for renting it before buying it will be rather insignificant. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, you should ask your kid what sounds fun for him. It is funnier indeed to use a DAW with a Midi keyboard connected to the PC. That way, it would be easier to learn. I mean, if you try to play some notes or learn rythm with a DAW, it is easier to learn playing on real instruments. Before i got a DAW, i had barely touched a piano/keyboard before. I had never played a melody before. But after a few months with learning rythm and how to use DAW's and learned how to use something called \"Piano Roll\" (A digital piano where you place notes with your mouse and the DAW can play it automatically in loops), i sat myself down at a keyboard and managed to play melodies easy without hestitating. The only bad thing is that you don't learn how to hold/place your fingers on the instrument. But hey, that's just me and my opinion. Good luck! ",
