            "answer_text": "As someone else said, if you wrote it, it\u2019s original. However, I have big musical ears, a voracious and eclectic appetite, and a deep memory, so one of my constant \u201cchecks\u201d on my own pieces is that I\u2019m not subconsciously copying something I\u2019ve heard someone else do. Famous plagiarism cases from this abound (George Harrison is one that comes to mind), but all you can do is proof it yourself against being an actual copy the best you can, and then run it by a lot of other people. In the end, there is not a lot of music that is truly \u201cnew\u201d, at least in Western music culture. Everything comes from and is built on a musical past that we all have a share in; anyone who creates is using building blocks from other sources; their experiences, their memories. I happen to like descending bass lines and I can rattle off at least 25 classic rock tunes that reference the same chord pattern (25 or 6 to 4 / Babe, I\u2019m Gonna Leave You / Can\u2019t Find My Way Home / Dear Prudence, etc., etc., etc.) but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I\u2019m not original if I use it. However, I do want to use it in a different way, and be creative in how I use it. After a gig one night I heard a band playing a really lame version of Bob Dylan\u2019s All Along The Watchtower. It irritated me because, despite it\u2019s musical repetition, I\u2019ve always liked the tune (Dylan is certainly the great wordsmith), so I decided to do a take on it by making it into a Ska song with horns. Everyone liked it!!\u2026. so much so that I wanted to publish it, but I didn\u2019t want to go through the whole licensing thing with Mr. Dylan\u2019s lawyers, so I began modifying it. I changed the lyrics, the melody, the underlying chord structure, etc. until it wasn\u2019t All Along The Watchtower anymore at all\u2026. which leads me to this: A favorite quote of mine that has been attributed in various forms to Picasso and Stravinsky, among others, goes \u201cmediocre composers borrow, great composers steal\u201d This is actually by author/poet T.S. Eliot in an essay on \u201cliterary debts\u201d and I think the original is even better: \u201c\u201cImmature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Most of the popular music of today consists in three or four chords in a 3/4 or 4/4 tempo, a little variation in the middle, and that\u2019s it. It could have layers of sounds on it, to make it more \u201cprofound\u201d or complex. But, in the base of the structure, is always the same. Those three or four chords usually go together, the sound in harmony. It\u2019s pleasing to the ears. It\u2019s made for the masses, and for the money. An original song, on the other hand, comes from an original idea. A feeling you want to express, a memory you want to bring back from the past. It usually goes with the music. The music adapts itselfs to that idea. And it\u2019s honest, truthful and beautiful. I\u2019m not saying four chords songs can\u2019t be original. Also, I\u2019m not saying that a jazz song is always, no matter what, somewhat original and innovative. Music is something that comes from the heart. Make sure it\u2019s always conceived there. That it usually comes from certain genres is another topic. ",
