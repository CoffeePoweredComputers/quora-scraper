            "answer_text": "We are speaking in the past tense here, and both of them did their best work a long time ago. Drug addiction (Baker) and alcoholism (Mitchell) blighted their later years. Baker had brute power, imagination, and jazz chops. Mitchell was a lighter hitter but very nimble. Mitchell was certainly a better person. Baker was technically better, but I cannot answer your question definitively. Baker could never have played with Hendrix. Mitchell could have ably backed Clapton. ",
