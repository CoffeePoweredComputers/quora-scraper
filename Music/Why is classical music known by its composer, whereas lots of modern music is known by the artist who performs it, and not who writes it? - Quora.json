            "answer_text": "Historically, Western music did not always have the tradition of revering the composer as the supreme authority in music. Most compositions were commissioned either by the church or the aristocracy prior to the proliferation of the music publishing houses in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Music and the other arts were mostly recognised by the authority who commissioned the work, more so than the artist who did it - and even then, the artist may not necessarily do all the work. It would not be uncommon for the commissioner - that is, he who hires the artist - to give instructions for the manner of work that he wants to be created. It might be like wondering more about who owns a mansion than who designed it. However, this somewhat changed during the time of Beethoven. As composers grew rather independent of patronage from the wealthy and clerical classes, they could construct their own image from a paying public who purchased and performed their works. Beethoven in particular amassed a pretty noble reputation in this manner, as did others such as Wagner and Tchaikovsky. Artists became far more respected, and came to be viewed by the public as geniuses capable of esoteric craftsmanship rather than servants to be hired. Modern popular music might operate differently, given its focus on the song form and the entertainer that performs the song, but this is not necessarily as new as we might think. There was a time when the opera was dominated more by the star singer than the composer, and in fact, certain operas were composed for these singers. This is not true for all \u201cmodern\u201d music, of course - most orchestral music, for instance, is identified by the composer; you might know that John Williams composed \u201cDuel of the Fates\u201d but not necessarily which orchestra performed it, for instance. I would say it is more the fact that the popular song form, by its very nature a very flexible design, is so created as to allow more freedom of interpretation by the performer than, for instance, an orchestral or instrumental score. Most popular songs are designed to be accessible to the common enthusiast, and this sort of flexibility is what allows the performer to make a name out of him (or her) self by having the freedom to decide his/her kind of interpretation on it.

            "answer_text": "Creating a major piece of classical music is a highly complex undertaking that only a small number of people are capable of. Writing a symphony, opera or string quartet that stands the test of time as a part of the enduring repertoire earns a composer a high level of respect. In classical music, it is the composition which comes first - the performer\u2019s job is to realize the composer\u2019s intentions as faithfully as possible, while imbuing it with their own personality. A popular song is primarily a vehicle for a singer. The focus is on the performer - their voice, their personality. The production of a song is also very important - the arrangement and sound of the recording. Many songs are fairly \u201canonymous\u201d in content. When a singer has a riveting presence or a truly remarkable voice, our focus is on them. We don\u2019t necessarily give much thought to the person who wrote the music, even if it is a great piece of writing - the performer takes up most of our attentiong. But there are many exceptions in both directions. In the world of opera, the emphasis can shift to the singer. People practically worship certain opera singers, and the composers of the material they sing become less important (particularly away from the context of a production of a full opera - for instance, in a solo concert or a recording of various material). There are also instrumentalists whose personality tends to eclipse the music they are performing. They attract an audience which is primarily there to see the \u201cstar,\u201d secondarily because of the composer. The pianist Lang Lang would be a good example. In popular music, there are many songwriters whose songs cannot truly be separated from their personae - Bob Dylan, The Beatles and most groups that write their own material. It\u2019s hard to really say which takes priority. But there are other non-performing songwriters who have a strong personality, people such as Burt Bacharach. His songs are mostly known in versions by professional singers, but you can easily put together a collection of Bacharach songs with a variety of different performers - the songs themselves have a personality of their own, regardless of who is singing them.
