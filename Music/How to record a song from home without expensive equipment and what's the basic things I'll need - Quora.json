            "answer_text": "My honest answer and it\u2019s a controversial one. First off, ask yourself how far you want to take this hobby? Recording audio is a very easy hobby to get into but a very complex one to master. You could just open up audacity and record yourself singing through your laptop microphone, or you could open up a notes recorder on your phone and record anything you like and then upload the recorded file to your computer. That\u2019s the very easy hobby to get into\u2026You want to be a little bit more advanced than entry level. Here is what you will need\u2026 Cash!! the more the better.. Here is what you will spend your cash on.. SoftwareHardwareMicrophonesMic StandsInstrumentsRoom treatmentAmplifiersGear!Software\u2026 Okay so first thing you should understand is the DAW (digital audio workstation) These are a lifetime of learning in themselves. They are also expensive. My controversial bit.. You can pirate many of the best ones if your sole intention is to learn, just remember by pirating you are not supporting the developers and you are a leech on the industry. If you decide to pirate (and the only reason you should is because you cannot afford to buy it yet) make sure when you can afford to support the industry, buy that software. I advocate piracy because I think it is a unique ability to learn some expensive software before commiting to buy. Software will take research. There are also many free options. Audacity, Garageband, Ardour, try those first. Garageband is only for Mac.For a complete studio try Linux KxStudio, this also has a steep learning curve. You gotta learn a lot to get into this hobby.Some good software recommendations.Logic Pro X, Bitwig Studio, Ableton Live, Avid Pro Tools, Reaper, Harrison Mixbus\u2026 There are many more, do some research.. Hardware\u2026 You need a good computer to run a DAW, however! if you choose the linux KX studio or one of the many other linux media distro\u2019s you can do a lot with a little hardware. Professionals tend to use Mac, with Pro Tools software. If you do have a Mac I recommend giving garageband a try. On top of a good computer you will also want a DAC, (digital audio converter) aka an audio interface. There are entry level ones and professional ones. It\u2019s all about your budget. I recommend Audient as a solid brand that make high quality equipment at a good price. sweetwater is a good online resource, also checkout Thomann they are a very good company to buy audio equipment and instruments. Microphones\u2026 This is it, you are deep in the rabbit hole, microphones are an endless pursuit. You will start with one and build from there, okay, starter microphone 100% the Shure sm57/sm58 both of these microphones are a solid starter companion to any budding music producer. Then you will want to get a condenser microphone.. Don\u2019t know what that means? Well it\u2019s time for more research and study then.. Start reading about different microphones, find out the history, what did your favourite artists use?Microphones also need cables. You will need to invest in good mic cables. Don\u2019t know the difference between XLR and speaker jack? Good thing you are about to start researching all about cables too! Mic Stands\u2026 Yep you will need them too.. Recording yourself playing acoustic guitar? To get that sweet sound your gonna have to mess around with mic placement. Your going to need multiple mics, multiple mics means multiple mic stands. They can be cheap, but cheap ones break. Do you need a boom or just a stand? Instruments\u2026 Oh man this is getting expensive. You play guitar ? You probably already have one. Not a guitar player, that\u2019s good, how about the piano? Look into various synths, thinking of recording drums? remember those mic stands you just bought. You\u2019re gonna need special mics for a drumkit. Trombone? Saxophone? Singing coach so you sound amazing on record? Room treatment\u2026 You did it, months have gone by and you have invested a lot of time into your recording hobby, you have even made some decent recordings, but something still doesn\u2019t sound right. It\u2019s time to get rid of the A/C hum in the background, those vocals you recorded always sound \u2018boomy roomy\u2019. Another subject that goes on and on and on. Room treatment. Wooden floors? Bass traps? Wow I nearly forgot! your going to need speakers to listen back to your recordings, those are going to be expensive monitor speakers and you will only get your money\u2019s worth if your using them in a treated room! You can start out with expensive headphones but your going to need speakers too.. Amplifiers\u2026 on and on and on\u2026Guitar amp modelling is pretty good these days but a real amp will always be a real amp, you can hear it fill the room, crank up that Marshall, stick your SM57 need the sound hole and let rip! Gear\u2026 It\u2019s getting tedious now, Gear is the catch all term.. Once you enter this world there are endless aisles of \u2018GEAR\u2019. Don\u2019t get caught in the gumption trap. Physical gear, compressors, processors, meters, pre amps, mounting racks, power converters.. etc etc. There is also an endless amount of software gear, a lot of which can also be pirated and many good DAW\u2019s contain most of the same gear known as stock plugins. This is a good time to buy a book on the subject or start spending your days watching youtube channels, because one great thing about this moment of time we are living in is that youtube is full of teachers wanting to help others. Go there now and search for someone giving a tutorial on your chosen subject\u2026 Okay still with me? You can do this.. You can do it without expensive equipment. Set goals. Start with the basics. A free DAW such as Ardour. A basic microphone and interface setup. Scaffold your knowledge, always start with the core concepts and build on those.I would love to hear what you create, leave a soundcloud link in the comments. ",

            "answer_text": "Ignore these long, drawn-out comments outlining all the gear that you might find useful. The basic things you need to record music in 2020 are\u2026 A DAW or multitrack recorder. VST support is helpful but not absolutely necessary.Stuff that generates or captures sound. (VST instruments, a microphone, a voice, a digital or analog instrument, a dog, a cat, a stick).THATS IT. SERIOUSLY! YOU CAN MAKE MUSIC WITH JUST THIS! Caveat: if you want to record analog inputs (electric guitars and keyboards) - you will need an audio interface. If you want to record using microphones - you will also need an audio interface and/or a mic pre-amplifier. Most interfaces these days have mic pre-amps in them. For DAW recording I would suggest the behringer U-PHORIA UM2. It has 2 inputs, headphones and RCA output. USB powered. Very compliant. Around $40. If you want to play software instruments using a keyboard you will need a MIDI Keyboard such as the M-AUDIO KeyStudio. ",

            "answer_text": "Try Garage Band. It came free with my iPhone and iMac. I also have Logic Pro X, but that costs $300. Look at the iRigHD 2. It will allow you to interface a guitar to your computer and comes with free software to make your guitar sound hundreds of different ways, as well as allowing you to record. Since you do not mention what kind of instrument(s) you are going to use, I cannot get specific because there are Midi interfaces for electronic instruments. Non electronic instruments would require a mic and connections for that. Plus you will need software. Google \u201cDAW\u201d or \u201cDigital Audio Workstation\u201d. You will find software ranging from the free to the very expensive. Depending on what kind of computer you have, or even a smart phone, will determine what you need to interface it to the software. This is what I use:  ",
