            "answer_text": "In one sense, nothing. Yes, \u201cStairway\u201d has lasted as an iconic song for nearly fifty years. But I\u2019m sure there are people alive right now who will associate \u201cYummy\u201d with some youthful delight or triumph, and will remember it fondly to the end of their days. \u201cStairway\u201d can take you on an eventful journey, like the best of Seventies rock. From the acoustic guitar intro all the way to the final line, it keeps changing and tells a musical story. Like all the best music, it can give a deep emotional experience. And while it\u2019s highly popular, it wasn\u2019t intended as a hit - hell, it wasn\u2019t ever released as a single - it was just the result of Jimmy, Robert, JPJ, and John coming up with something they thought was a good song. But \u201cYummy\u201d doesn\u2019t change because it doesn\u2019t need to change - it starts perfect and it ends perfect, and everything in-between is the same, is perfection. The effects and the programmed beat and and the Autotune are the last word in Big Time professional hit production. They sound like every other Big Time hit, but that\u2019s OK. You might be able to dance to \u201cStairway,\u201d but you probably wouldn\u2019t think of doing so; that\u2019s not the kind of song it is. You wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of how Zeppelin look when you hear it, just how they sound. But \u201cYummy\u201d forces you to dance, forces you to notice what a cute bad boy Justin is, and that\u2019s the whole point of it. Anything else is just subjective value judgments. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t mean anything. You\u2019d have to wait another fifty years, and see if \u201cYummy\u201d develops the same kind of iconic reputation that \u201cStairway\u201d has, to make any meaningful comments or comparisons. ",

            "answer_text": "That particular song is better because there are different parts to it, so it goes slow, faster, slow again. Also, the imagery is faerie-like \u2026. those lyrics are so beautifully-written. Yummy is much better to dance to, because of the beat of course. But Stairway To Heaven is much classier! ",
