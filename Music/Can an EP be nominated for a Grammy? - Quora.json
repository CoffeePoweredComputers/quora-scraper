            "answer_text": "According to Wikipedia\u2026\u2026. In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America, the organization that declares releases \"gold\" or \"platinum\" based on numbers of sales, defines an EP as containing three to five songs or under 30 minutes. [13] On the other hand, The Recording Academy's rules for Grammy Awards state that any release with five or more different songs and a running time of over 15 minutes is considered an album, with no mention of EPs. [14 So technically your EP will be considered an album if recognized by the Grammy Association\u2026. So the Academy technically does not recognize EP's it's either an album,or not; determined by how many minutes and how many tracks are on your \u201calbum\u201d. Remixes are in a seperate category.
