            "answer_text": "I was really into Linkin Park during the early years of the 2000s. The song In The End was just formidable, and I couldn\u2019t stop listening to them. And then I dove into their discography. What I\u2019ve DoneNew DivideNumbFaintShadow Of The DayBleed It OutHands Held Highand so so many more And then came A Thousand SunsAnd I was like, man! You\u2019re the best artists right now!IridescentBurning In The SkiesWaiting For The EndBlackoutAll were fantastic tracks. The music so awesome, the lyrics so meaningful. Then Living Things came out. Simple on music, but heavy on lyrics. Mesmerizing!Castle Of GlassBurn It DownIn My RemainsRoads UntraveledLost In The EchoUntil It Breaks. Linkin Park were just so in my playlists at that time. Then they announced that they would try some NU Metal in their new album,and then they released The Hunting Party, and it was really great. Guilty All The SameWastelandsWarMark The Graves All great ones, and I listen to them whenever I need to lift up my spirits. Linkin Park is the band which was the first one that I really was into, and I still am.I have a separate playlist for their each album, and I listen to them almost daily. In the last few months, I\u2019ve been more inclined towards Electronic Dance Music, but In The End, It Doesn\u2019t Even Matter. ",

            "answer_text": "I was crazy about Nirvana and Green Day when I first heard them almost 12 years ago. And no I\u2019m not really into them anymore. Reason: I\u2019m a musician and as I\u2019ve grown older, the teen angst, lyrical themes and pretty straightforward songwriting that drew me to these bands, doesn\u2019t really appeal to me like it did back then. On the other hand, I\u2019ve come to appreciate bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Beatles and The Doors, over the years. In my humble opinion, they\u2019re the reason why the 60s and the 70s is often regarded as the golden period of Rock music. ",
