            "answer_text": "People move stock prices. Allow me to add some color. A bunch of (eccentric) people are sitting across the aisle from each other, holding up signs. On one side (the bid side), people are offering to buy a certain stock at $4.99/share. On the other side (the ask side), a group silently sits with their arms folded, demanding $5.00. Like some grim parliament, rows of stadium seating extend as far as the eye can see on both sides. Someone far back on the bid side holds a sign saying $4.83. He will only buy a share if someone offers it for the price he wants. Somewhere far back on the ask side, someone waves a sign that says $5.50. He would never sell for less. A buyer walks into the middle of this strange ritual and, thinking that $5.00 is quite fair for a share of XYZ (for whatever reason), purchases a share from the ask side. A no-less-grim man with a chalkboard records the sale. One share was transacted for $5.00. This is now the \"market price.\" Now, in comes a seller. He would happily get rid of his share for $4.99, and so he approaches the bid side and sells his share to one of the bidders. For what it's worth, the market price is now $4.99. Hark! The sound of patent leather soles! In marches a rotund man with a wig, waving some indecent volume of cash, offering to buy however many shares his money will get him. He buys up every share from the ask's first ($5.00), second ($5.01), third ($5.02), and even some of the fourth ($5.03) rows! Now, the market price is $5.03, and the remaining gentlemen asking for $5.03 move up to the front row of the ask side, waving their signs. The others from the ask side have already exited with cash in hand. Amidst the confusion, some from the bid side's front row are pushed back by fresh bidders, who are now willing to pay anywhere from $5.00 to $5.02 for what was, only a few brief moments ago, a $4.99 stock. Somehow or another, they hope to profit by this move. Others, confused, scared, or disgusted, simply leave. At least one gentleman is running wildly between the two camps, yelling absurd things and waving several signs. Two seconds have elapsed in the market since we began this story, and a lot has changed. Except, well, one very important thing hasn't changed at all: A bunch of (eccentric) people are (still) sitting across the aisle from each other, holding up signs. ",

            "answer_text": "Jesse Livermore, one of the greatest speculators that I am aware of, said that it takes buying, and a lot of it, to put a stock up. I don't dare to disagree with him lightly, but in my experience the way markets work is more nuanced, especially on a shorter term horizon. What makes price change is a change in the collective mental state of the total pool of actual and potential buyers and sellers of a security.  Sometimes a stock will see heavy volume, and the price won't move.  At other times, the tiniest trade will move the price a lot. So one then needs to understand what shapes the mental state of people.  That's a much tougher question, because psychologists still have much to understand about the factors that shape perception.  The neuroeconomics lesson is that perception is heavily shaped by affect, and this is a subtle and powerful phenomenon that is like an iceberg - it is only partly accessible to conscious awareness.  Because affect is contagious there are patterned dynamics in group behaviour that influence the affect of each member of the group.Page on caltech.edu In contrast to the intuitive view of human behavior as driven by deliberations about costs and benefits, it does not do a terrible injustice to the field of psychology to say that a growing consensus has developed around the view that affect is primary in the sense that it is \u201cfirst on the scene\u201d and plays a dominant role in behavior. Indeed, as we discuss below (section 3.4.2), the conscious brain often erroneously interprets behavior that emerges from automatic, affective, processes as the outcome of cognitive deliberations. Page on socionomics.org One really has to understand that price moves before the news that justifies the move.  So if one wants to anticipate moves in price, one needs to find a way to anticipate underlying developments in fundamentals.  One way to do that comes when one realises that superficial fundamental developments are often the expression of much deeper underlying, often subterranean, processes that have their beginnings well before the moment that people more widely tend to become aware of them.
