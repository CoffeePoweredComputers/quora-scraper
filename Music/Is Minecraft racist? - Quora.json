            "answer_text": "Racist is a complete understatement. Minecraft is not only racist, but the love child of sexism, xenophobia and class discrimination.  Source a): Evidence of police brutality against an unarmed green person of the \u201czombie\u201d race. SexismWhy are the tough green skinned people only male? Minecraft is teaching our children sexist notions that males are tougher than females. Outrageous! XenophobicJust because people have green skin and stretch out their arms for hugs doesn\u2019t mean that they should be brutally oppressed with swords and violence. This is not okay. This is normalizing xenophobic brutality from figures of authority! Class discriminationHave you ever considered that zombies are homeless and just want to protect themselves from the sun which kills them? Instead players (our children) are incentivized to kill them and take their meager possessions, namely rotten flesh. It doesn\u2019t matter that Minecraft servers bring together people from across the world.Nor does it matter that Minecraft is a medium where adults and children may express their creativity in a world of rising Lego prices.It doesn\u2019t matter that Minecraft teaches real world physics.  Source google: floating tree Minecraft is obviously propaganda and I definitely haven\u2019t invested a significant chunk of my childhood playing it. #greenlivesmatter. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. Not at all. But what about the lack of skin color? Ya see, us gamers don\u2019t care. In fact, we find it insulting when our games bend to the political pressure of equality representing each group of people on this Earth. Why? Because we have never had that problem as gamers. We don\u2019t play a game and think of how racist it is or why it doesn\u2019t have girls, but the answer is simple. It isn\u2019t important. I\u2019ve played games as people of different colors and thought nothing of it. It didn\u2019t improve gameplay, it didn\u2019t teach me about accepting different cultures, and it didn\u2019t get me to like or dislike the game more. Video games and movies have immunity from racism because things that aren\u2019t sentient can\u2019t be racist. They can depict times in history when racism was around, or an alternative timeline where it never left. Books can be somewhat racist because only one person wrote them, but games are made by a group of people who are worrying about gameplay and gameplay alone. Those who don\u2019t focus entirely on the game and more on meeting a political quota get a really bad rap amongst gamers. Remember Battlefield V? Yeah, gamers hated how that game looked because it was so sad to see a game that wanted to be an accurate depiction of WW2 turned into political propaganda. There\u2019s many ways that they could have included female fighters in WW2 without using a crippled female British fighter on the frontlines who somehow beat a grown man in melee combat. Grown man beats grown woman in physical strength, like it or not. The game told us,\u201dthis is the game now, like it or not\u201d. Us gamers chose not to like it. So in conclusion, no game should have to be accepting of all races, sexes, and sexualities because I highly doubt that the developers of Minecraft were worried about if they made the game diverse enough, they were thinking about how the gameplay worked and how they could improve it. People simply choose to take offense to things. ",
