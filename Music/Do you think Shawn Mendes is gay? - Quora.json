            "answer_text": "HAHAHAHAaaargh okay. I\u2019m sorry, but I stumbled upon this question and really cannot restrain myself from voicing my opinion on this one. Here\u2019s a step-by-step way to solve your pitiful dilemma: Figure out why you care so much about the personal life of a celebrity.Realize that you shouldn\u2019t care so much about the personal life of a celebrity.Stop caring so much about the personal life of a celebrity.In addition, do me a favour and chew on this: now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re LGBT yourself, but whether you are or not doesn\u2019t really matter. Please realize that if, by some miracle, Shawn Mendes is LGBT and wants to \u201ccome out\u201d to his \u201cfans\u201d, it could jeopardize his career. Although the level of acceptance that today\u2019s society (in America) offers to the LGBT community is much higher than it was, say, 10 years ago, there are still some assholes who will put you down for being LGBT. For example, singer Sir Elton John hid his homosexuality for years before finally coming out when society began to be more accepting. He even went as far as singing about \u201cgirlfriends\u201d when he was really targeting his male crushes/significant others. THINK ABOUT IT. ",

The singer request that why it has to do anything with one's sexuality. When what he is giving is music. That too a good one. He is a talented singer. Watch this clip and your queries will be answered  Even if is gay, in the slightest way possible. It is the last thing he wants people bragging about it everywhere. Clearly he is not comfortable with all the jokes and talks going on internet. That is why he goes viral telling everyone that he isn't. Respect his choices and concentrate on his music than his sexuality. Love is love, not bound by gender, race, color. What will anyone do if he turns out to be asexual. ( Only a situation,not that he is) he would appreciate it very much if every one relate to what he says. ",
