            "answer_text": "Technically, yes. They are usually tuned the same. But there are major differences that you should consider before any purchase. Electric basses don't have the feedback issues that Acoustic basses have. Especially in loud rock band situations. And electric basses are much easier to transport. The electric bass also has different types of pickups ( generally) where as an acoustic upright has an aftermarket \u201c transducer\u201d installed The acoustic upright bass also can be bowed. Now, if you are referring to an acoustic \u201c Guitar body\u201d style of bass the feedback issues might be diminished some, and the transportability is much easier to deal with, but you are still dealing with a \u201c transducer\u201d pickup as opposed to a \u201chumbucker\u201d or Coil pickup that is much more friendly to loud volume situations than a transducer. And though they may be portable ( the \u201cguitar body\u201d Style acoustic bass,) I have yet to hear one that, (when played strictly acoustically ) has any decent tonality versus an upright acoustic bass.

            "answer_text": "In my experience the amplification of an acoustic bass (NOT an upright) is problematic in a band situation. They just don\u2019t seem to have enough cut through to mix well. It\u2019s tough to compete against a drum set and/or an electric guitar going through a serious amp. ",
