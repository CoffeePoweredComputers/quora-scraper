            "answer_text": "There are a few factors contributing to the global popularity of the music of the United States.  We're rich. Not all of us, but there's a lot of money floating around. People have access to the best equipment, creative professionals, teachers, marketing, management and so on. Access to these things is wildly uneven, but it does exist. That gives our music great production value, not to mention our videos, concert films and so on.We're cool. American culture was predicated on rebellion and individual freedom. Our reality may not live up to those ideals, but they are really glamorous in the abstract. Also, everyone likes to imitate the rich and powerful, and we collectively certainly are that.We have a lot of oppressed ethnic minorities and immigrants. Our boring Anglo cultural baseline is significantly enriched by influences from Africa, the Caribbean and every other corner of the earth. The hybridization and appropriation of the best of all musical cultures guarantees that our music offers something for everyone. Black music in particular holds universal appeal because it carries a strong emotional message of overcoming hardship, dancing in the face of misery. Our music has a lot of effective transmission vectors. As Adam Gerow points out, we have Hollywood, not to mention all those video games and web sites. I'd guess that the ratio of good to bad music is about the same everywhere you go. But the US produces so much music that we have to produce a lot of quality work just by the law of averages. The world finds out about Michael Jackson, not all his lesser imitators.",

            "answer_text": "The following genres seem to be the most popular worldwide:  Pop (often a combination of genres, such as R&B and Electronic)Electronic (House, Trance, Dubstep, etc.)Rhythm & Blues (contemporary styles)Rock, Hard Rock, and MetalRapReggae & DancehallMost of these genres have roots in American music from the mid-1900s. Rhythm & Blues, in particular, set much of the blueprint for genres that followed (with Rock music being a branch, more influenced by the \"Blues\" of R&B than by its \"Rhythm\"). I agree that Jamaica is surely the winner in terms of being the country with the highest output of popular music per capita. I believe Jamaica might be thought of as an extreme version of the same dynamic that caused cities such as Detroit, NYC, and New Orleans to be musical hotbeds. I think it was no coincidence that the music that set off the Jamaican music revolution was American R&B of the 50s and 60s. It would have been impossible to take Jamaican Mento and turn it into a worldwide sensation. But R&B was like jet fuel in the Jamaican music scene. England is clearly one of the big players in global music, and it would be hard to deny that its influence doesn't owe a huge debt to its long-running musical exchange with the U.S. (and Jamaica). Every style of English pop music can trace its historical roots back to the U.S. And likewise, American music has been heavily influenced by England. One of the most interesting results of the US/UK/JA confluence has been the emergence of Dubstep. As the name suggests, Dubstep traces many roots back to Jamaican styles such as Dub (which, in turn, trace much of their heritage back to the U.S.). And now the circle is full, with U.S. artists such as Skrillex adopting Dubstep, and establishing it as an emerging global genre. I tend to view music as a technology. The goal is to make people feel good, and the music is a tool to accomplish it. If R&B might be considered a \"musical technology\", the history of popular music has suggested that R&B is a strong technological foundation for other variants and offshoots. Partly, this is because the audience has an appetite for, and familiarity with, R&B-related styles. But I think more often it is simply the effectiveness of the music at making people feel good. If I had to speculate on what genre of music is currently most popular, I would guess Electronic music (House, Trance, etc.). If that is true, it further suggests the continued influence of R&B \"technologies\" on global music. On the other hand, the popularity of electronic artists from outside the US/UK/JA axis, also suggests that the English-speaking monopoly on global pop music might be diminishing a bit. ",
