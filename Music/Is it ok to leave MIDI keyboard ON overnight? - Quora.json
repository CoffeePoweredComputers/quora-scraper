            "answer_text": "This is a great question. A MIDI keyboard draws very little power, so there\u2019s really no reason to be concerned with that. You should be running your music gear through a UPS or a power conditioner, so that would take care of any current anomalies. Leaving the keyboard on won\u2019t affect the lifespan in any meaningful way, though you may find that the display will burn out sooner than if you turned it off every night. That said, the display will probably burn out long after you\u2019ve already sold the unit and bought the next great keyboard on the market, so this really isn\u2019t much of a factor either. In short, it doesn\u2019t matter one bit. If it\u2019s more convenient for you to leave your controller on 24/7, just go ahead and do so. When I played keyboards for Cirque du Soleil\u2019s \u201cO\u201d production in Las Vegas, we left ALL of the music equipment on 24/7, including over the weekends and extended dark days. We NEVER had any issues from leaving the gear on. It was incredibly convenient to be able to walk in to play without having boot everything up, and it was nice not having to be concerned with powering down at the end of the evening. I now leave my gear powered on all the time in my home studio and I\u2019ve never had any issues. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a good question! I keep forgetting to turn mine off too! As mentioned in other answers, the power rating is small, it should not affect the lifespan much. Also mentioned, I agree that it would be better to turn the power off as much a possible, just to save on the lifespan of the electrical and electronic components in your device. This is especially true if your keyboard has LED indicators and alpha/ numerical/ graphical display screens. Especially critical if they are needed to operate your keyboard properly. Some keyboards controllers are rather basic / no-frills, you can just turn them on, by default they send to all channels, and you just turn them on and use them straight away. If that's all you do with the keyboard and the display/ LEDs burn out, it's still fine. Otherwise you may want to go easy on the running hours. At the end of the day I truly believe power and electronic components of decent brands of controllers should be able to last. I would expect the mechanical parts of the keyboard to wear out before their electronic components give up. ",
