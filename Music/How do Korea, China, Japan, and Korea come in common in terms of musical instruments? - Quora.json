Because they\u2019re the same culture, so they share literally the same instruments, so\u2026 I\u2019ll change that question into: \u201cHow do China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam share commonalities in terms of musical instruments?\u201d Most, if not all, of these either had origins in China or came to China first, then spread to the other three. Some of these have disputable origins, but are still very similar and may even use similar names. Sometimes, a single instrument can have multiple descendants from one region, so expect some with 2 or more related instruments in the same country.
