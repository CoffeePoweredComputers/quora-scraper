            "answer_text": "Yeah,But,Many misconcept the margin of difference between composing and songwriting,if an idol is involved in any part of their music production,you can term it as \u201cself-producing\",but the major confusion among fandoms is that,they confuse an idol who writes a song with a idol who composes his song,you know there is a big difference,A big example is BTS,Suga,Jhope and RM are involved in all of their song's lyrical composition,but they don't compose songs as fans think,here they think that members do everything including composing but actually members are only involved in song writing but they rarely compose any songs,averagely members are only involved in 2\u20133 songs composition per album,but fans misconcept them as producer whereas they are only assigned as songwriters,this is a big misunderstading,because in cinematic music industry,the music directors aka producers or composers are enlisted as producers whereas songwriters are called as lyricists but in kpop,many fans insist to call idol who work as a lyricist as a producer,which is wrong,i think this is the reason for the big confusion.But,there too in kpop,some idol groups who have members who can be called as producers unlike some idols who are called as producers but they arent one,examples of idol producers/composers(not lyricist) are GD and TOP from bigbang,Ravi from VIXX,Woozi from SVT,B.I,Chanyeol and sehun from EXO SC,LAY from EXO,Zico from BLOCKB,etc,and there are more idols who can be assigned as Composers and can be rightfully called Producers as well as lyricists since they work on that department,i hope you understand this.
