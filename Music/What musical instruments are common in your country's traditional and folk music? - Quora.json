            "answer_text": "In Ireland, almost any instrument. There are just three that I can think of that are only associated (make that almost exclusively) with Irish music: The whistle, also called the tin whistle or penny whistle: \u201ca simple, six-holed woodwind instrument\u201d Wikipedia. Woodwind may be a misnomer as many are made out of metal and plastic. More and more, though, they are being made from wood by fine instrument makers but it is amazing to me the music that can come from that cheap little instrument.. Their very simplicity requires that a different whistle will be required for each key.  Uilleann pipes. If the penny whistle is simplicity itself then the uileann pipes are on the other end of the scale. They are bag pipes powered by a bellows. Unlike the Scottish bagpipes they are a chamber instrument. The melody is played on a chanter, there are three drones that play a constant note and a bank of three regulators with levers on them. These levers are depressed by the wrist to sound chords. Not too many can master this instrument.  Bodhran. The only thing exclusively Irish about this instrument is the name. It is just a frame drum and something similar is used in most traditional cultures. Its use in Ireland was not widespread until Sean O\u2019Riada used it with Ceoltoiri Chualann in the late 50s/early 60s. In those days the instrument was simplicity itself, a skin stretched over a rim (at least 18\u2033) with crossbars and played with the hand or a wooden beater. The other hand would do nothing but hold the bodhran. Today\u2019s bodhran is smaller (15\u2033 or less) and almost always has tuners that allow for the adjustment of tension to an ideal. Also both hands are used, one inside the rim to change to tone to suit the tune. Beaters are now called tippers and come in many varieties.  The most common other instruments are fiddle (violin), flute (usually wooden and keyless though concert flutes are sometimes used), accordion, melodion, concertina, guitar, bouzouki, spoons. Now and then hammer dulcimer. Though it is the symbol of Ireland, harps are rare. ",

            "answer_text": "The iconic folk instrument from my part of England is the Northumbrian Small Pipes: the only indigenous English bagpipes still in existence.  (The Andy May Trio\u2019s take on the traditional Northumbrian melody \u2018Cuckold come out of the Amrey\u2019 - an \u2018Amrey\u2019 is a Northumbrian word for a sort of walk-in cupboard, or pantry, and has an odd sort of link to the word \u2018Armoury\u2019) Like most other small pipe systems in the British Isles - notably the Scots Border Small Pipes and Irish Small Pipes - these are inflated using a bellows strapped under the player\u2019s right elbow, rather than being blown into by the mouth (as with the Scottish or Irish War Pipes).  (Image source Making a Set of Northumbrian Smallpipes) The great difference, however, lies in the chanter - the bottom-most pipe in the picture above. This is the pipe the piper holds to perform the melody. The Northumbrian pipe chanter is stoppered: the end of the pipe is permanently sealed off. This means that if none of the holes on the chanter are uncovered, then the only sound the instrument emits will be from the drone pipes (which can also be tuned down, or even shut off completely). This means that the Northumbrian piper is able to (as the saying goes) \u201cplay silence\u201d, and as a result, Northumbrian pipe music has a characteristically staccato rhythm: there is no need for the transitional \u201cgrace notes\u201d, that feature in the music of Scottish Great Pipes or the Border Small Pipes, for example.  The second thing about the chanter on these pipes, is the valves, or \u2018keys\u2019. Prior to the dawn of the 19th century, the Northumbrian pipes had only eight finger holes along the chanter - nothing else. Only one finger hole is uncovered at any one time, and it is impossible to over-blow them. Hence, the late medieval Northumbrian chanter was only capable of playing eight notes. However, from about 1800 onwards, pipers began fitting valves to their chanters, to create the polychromatic range that is the hallmark of Northumbrian pipe music today. A typical of set of pipes might now feature 8 finger holes and 16 valves - the valves being operated by the piper\u2019s right thumb and left little finger, respectively. The Northumbrian pipes thus have the distinction of going from being one of the simplest, to one of the most sophisticated, bagpipe systems, anywhere in the world, within the space of a few years - and this all happened several centuries ago. It is a transition that is visibly recorded in the vast amounts of sheet music, written for the pipes, before, during, and after this change took place. Here is Kathryn Tickell describing this change, before going on to perform a set-piece that helps demonstrate the transition.  ",
