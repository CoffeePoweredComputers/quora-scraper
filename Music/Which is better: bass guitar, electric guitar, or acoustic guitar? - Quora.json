            "answer_text": "Well that\u2019s very dependent on the situation and the opponent you\u2019re facing. Each has it\u2019s own pros and cons. Let\u2019s examine some: Bass Guitar - While not as unwieldy as it\u2019s cousin the double bass, electric bass is still the largest and slowest of the choices given. It\u2019s size however gives it excellent leverage and striking power against an armoured or shielded opponent where power is preferable to speed.  Electric Guitar - Though less effective as a battlefield weapon, it\u2019s balanced size and weight makes an electric guitar best in duels or close quarters fights with unarmoured opponents. Subtypes of this weapon can such as the quicker Strat, the armour piercing Tele or the bass-like power house Les Paul.  Acoustic Guitar - While light and satisfyingly large, the weak structural integrity of the acoustic makes it unsuitable for sustained, real combat. It is an excellent practice weapon however and great for stage fighting where the risk of injury is somewhat lessened by it\u2019s propensity to collapse in the first hit.  However, as with all close weaponry it\u2019s the skill of the user that makes the most difference. When faced with the long reach of the oboe or the powerful 360 degree defence of the tuba, even the most skilled fighter may struggle. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it really depends on the application. acoustic guitars burn more easily and they generally give off a nice bright light but being made of thin wood, they don't generate a lot of heat and they don't burn very long. Electric guitars are good for use as offensive weapons. They have enough mass to really do some damage, unlike acoustics, but are easier to swing than basses which are generally heavier. Basses, on the other hand, are excellent tools for breaking coconuts open. Obviously in this application acoustics are useless due to their light weight and flimsy construction. Electric guitars are ok but I find that the necks are not long enough to really generate a lot of force and they tend to separate from the body too easily. ",
