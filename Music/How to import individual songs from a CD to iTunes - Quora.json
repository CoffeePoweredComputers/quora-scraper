            "answer_text": "Set the import settings on iTunes to 320 kbps MP3 or 320 kbps AAC. If you want to save the CD tracks in the same quality as the CD, set the import settings to 16 bit 44.1 .wav to get an exact copy of the CD. This will take up a lot more space, but you can always convert them into smaller MP3 files, like the ones I listed above to save space on your iPhone or device. This way you\u2019ll have an original copy and a compressed copy to serve different purposes.Then insert the CD into your computer. It should show up in iTunes, then select the burn or import option and it should start copying the CD track by track. You can them move the tracks around however you like or create playlists.",
