            "answer_text": "\u201cHitch a Ride\u201d by Boston. The best written & orchestrated guitar solo of our time. Multiple guitars, some in harmony, answering each other back in each bar. Great Les Paul tones, at least three different ones, maybe more. Warm, Fuzzy, and Sharp. Tons of sustain & perfect bends. And best of all, a melody & hook all their own that\u2019s totally unique and removed from the precreceeding vocal arrangement. The solo is at the end of the song. Oddly enough, the middle solo is on organ, played by the same man, Tom Scholz - highly underrated as a rock organist. The organ solo actually \u201crocks\u201d more than the guitar solo! This guitar solo melody is as much a signature of the song as the vocal, as in much of his work. A melody you will hum to yourself long after the song is over. That is the critera for a great solo - NOT speed or tricks. Other answers think guitar is a competition. Nope - it\u2019s all about music - and what pleases the heart, soul, mind, & ears. Along these lines, many \u201ccorporate rock\u201d players have the gift. Check out Neal Schon on Journey\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s Crying Now\u201d or \u201cStone In Love\u201d - which both have a similar \u201cwhole \u2018nother song\u201d ending, with guitar melodies you can hum in the shower. He\u2019s obviously a student of Santana, who should get a mention here too. \u201cEuropa\u201d is now a classic melody, but is an instrumental really a solo? (Is it in the big book yet?) On the orchestration side, I would also reccomend \u201cThat Smell\u201d from Lynyrd Skynyrd. A truly horrible song with the most thought out guitar solos ever recorded. Not so hummable, but a signature of the song, and a tour de force of \u201clead break\u201d composition. Trading licks, multiple breakdowns, & continually building intensity make you totally forget all about the dopey lyrics. (Dopey - get it? Hahaha. ) Dare I say Better than Free Bird, and much more concise. Guitar playing is not about speed, kids. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm, that is an interesting question. I will try to answer this as best I can. I have an eclectic taste in music. The solos I am about to list below, I like for different reasons. Comfortably Numb-Pink Floyd, love the mood of the outro soloKid Charlemagne-Steely Dan, Love the middle soloWhite my guitar gently weeps-The Beatles: Love Eric Clapton\u2019s outro.Shine on you crazy diamond-Pink Floyd, just pure soulfulness.Phantom-Al DiMeola-Great jazz fusion instrumental.Europa-Santana-Pure soul here.Dolphin Dreams-Lee RitenhourMessiah will come again-Roy BuchananHey Joe-Jimi Hendrix: Especially some live versionsDown by the River-Roy BuchananThrill is gone-B B King: Good example how less can be more.I know you may have been looking for more shred like answers but those type of guitar solos don\u2019t appeal to me. I am more from the blues and jazz school. As a guitarist, I tend to prefer playing melodies on the guitar. ",
