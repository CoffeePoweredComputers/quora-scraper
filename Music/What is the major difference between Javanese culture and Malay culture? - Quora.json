            "answer_text": "The differences are like the Welsh and the English, huge from a certain perspective, modest from another. Take language. Most people know that there is a difference between Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia. What they do not realized is that both are actually evolved trade languages that allowed communications across what is now known as the Malaya world. The two largest groups in this world are the Orang Melayu (People\u2019s from Malaya) and Orang Jawa (People\u2019s from Java). Interestingly, neither group\u2019s ancestors spoke Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia, respectively. Prior to the 14 Century, the Malays in Malaysia spoke Old Malay. This was heavily influenced by Indian culture and particular the Cham culture who were in Cambodia and central Vietnam. Classical Malay arose with the importation of Islam. The language became heavily peppered with Arabic and Persian words. Classical Malay gave rise to Bahasa Melayu, which was started in Melaka (previously known as Malacca). 15th Century Melaka was a jewel of trade. It was the greatest of the entrepots and arguably the richest city in the world with an estimated population of over 200,000. There you would meet various types of Chinese, neighboring people including Javanese, Indians, Arabs, Africans and the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and English. Bahasa Melayu arose applying these words, sayings, phonetics, grammar concepts etc to Classical Malay. Java on the other hand has always spoke Javanese. There are three main variants but all are understandable to the others. But Javanese is a complex language much given to politeness, the giving of \u2018face\u2019 and being \u2018proper\u2019. For instance, even today, there are three forms of each Javanese strain. Ngoko is spoken among peers and considered casual. Madya or Krama Madya is a neutral form spoken between strangers. Then there is Krama or Krama Inggil, the polite or formal form. You would never address an elder in Ngoko but Krama Inggil. The differences between the three forms is not merely ones about nuances but vocabulary and grammar. For example: What is your name? Ngoko - Jenengmu sopo? Krama Inggil - Asmanipun panjenengan sinten? Then there is the humble and honorifics. But I am straying. The point is that this complexity led many to deem Javanese to be unsuitable for commerce and political discourse. Further, many people who are now Indonesian do not speak Javanese. Thus the founding fathers of Indonesia decided to keep the Malay that was being spoken in Indonesia and refine it, and this became Bahasa Indonesia. In short it is similar to Bahasa Melayu because they come from Melaka not because of some shared cultural or people history. The Javanese language root is Javanese. Its is very widely spoken even today. Javanese is the largest unrecognized language in the world and the 10th most common language. So for those who point to the Orang Melayu and Orang Jawa being similar and therefore there is not much differences between them, they are both: Wrong \u2013 Bahasa Indonesia is an import and based off Melaka Malay which has not basis in Javanese. So the logic that - they speak the same language so they must be similar - is not correct. Javanese continues to thrive and is spoken and widely spoken in Java. And Right \u2013 the modern generation are mixing both Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia heavily with the English of the internet. By doing so they are taking a leaf out of Melaka and also taking the next step of integration both across the Malay world and to the world in general. ",

            "answer_text": "Very different. It starts with tradition, norm, languages, food, believes, society and social construct. Im not gonna explain all these obvious stuff. There is also distinction between Javanese society in North Coast, East and Central Java. Javanese people are generally more spiritual and mystic. This is their way of life, not necessarily religious belief. People in the North coast have more \u201cforeign\u201d influences and are distinctive in their attitude. It could also root from the ancient tradition variances.  Boyong Dewi Sri, an offering to the Goddess of fertility Dewi Sri. A pre-Indian Goddess that today still are worshiped by those in the rural areas. Even by the Sunda Wiwitan (not religion, Sunda\u2019s old ways). The picture is taken in Jelok, Central Java.  An offering to the sea spirit in Indramayu, Java. This particular tradition have regional \u201cversions\u201d from Sumatra to Maluku, and even devoutly Catholic islands of Flores. Probably attributed to the fact that in the old days people relied their living on the sea, either as fishermen or merchants. Malay cultures in Sumatra and Kalimantan have regional variantion, even the languages aren\u2019t the same. Although they\u2019re called \u201cMalay\u201d by modern definition, it is most likely that they\u2019re different people with different cultures. Similar to why Tengger, Osing or Cirebonese aren\u2019t the same as Javanese. In fact these cultures are example of surviving old languages of various kingdoms, because not all of Java spoke the \u201cJavanese\u201d back then. Malay culture are more exposed to change and Islam, being mostly centered in the busy Malacca strait. Though I must admit that I haven\u2019t meet people of Malay background enough in here, so if anyone would tell me more, much would be appreciated.  Balimau Kasai in Kampar, Riau. Today it is practiced as a celebration prior to entering the fasting month. People would jump into the river as a mean to \u201cclean\u201d your sins. Whether this is indigenous tradition, \u201crecent\u201d tradition or Indian influence as a mean to wash away sins by bathing in Ganga River.  Taber Laot, or Buang Jong in Bangka. Also known as Jamuan Laut by Serdangnese Malay. Malay culture in Malaysia is based on the Royal Families of the different areas, what\u2019s defined as Malay by race, and religion. Culturally they\u2019re mostly \u201cMalaysian\u201d Malay which is closer to Riau, Brunei or Pontianak Malays. Some Malays in Malaysia today are descendant of indentured Indonesian workers who work in Rubber plantations or as Coolies. Some seafarer family may have settled in Malaya during the colonial period as merchants. But culturally as minorities and through intermarriages, they\u2019re fully Malaysian Malay. There are regional variation you can see in Terenganu and Kelantan, their dialects are not the same as Malay (I\u2019ve met them, so I know). People in the North probably have old Khmer and Thai influences too, if they\u2019re willing to dig in the ancient tradition.  Kelantanese Shadow Puppet Edit: I just noticed the news there. So by Malaysian arguments they have Indonesian blood (probably minority, they also are culturally Malaysian Malay), that Indonesian culture should be \u201cMalaysian\u201d heritage. Rather than distinctive regional culture. It is also part of Malay supremacy propaganda in Malaysian history book. Im not against Malaysian practicing them, but even in Indonesia who are probably much more mixed with one another, cultural groups wouldn\u2019t mess with the other. Keratons of Jogjakarta would never claim Reog Ponorogo, which is very regionally specific, as Javanese heritage on the whole. ",
