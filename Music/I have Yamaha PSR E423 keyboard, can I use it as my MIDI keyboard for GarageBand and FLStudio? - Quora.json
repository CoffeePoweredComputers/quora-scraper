            "answer_text": "Check first if your keyboard's manual talks about it. If it doesn't then I doubt it can be used as a MIDI keyboard.Check if your keyboard has an USB output port. If yes, then you need to buy a MIDI cable. Connect the cable with your computer. Check in FL studio sound settings if the keyboard is getting detected.If point 2 fails, download Yamaha sound driver from Google. Check again in FL studio if the keyboard is detected.If none works, you can buy separate MIDI keyboard from M-Audio. They are cheap and handy",
