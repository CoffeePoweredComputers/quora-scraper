            "answer_text": "You need hydraulic press. Probably one withat least a 10 ton capacity. because no amount of hammering will do it safely. I had it done once, because mopar went through a left hand thread phase in the 60\u2019s. And sourcing lug bolts became an issue, and impact wrenches would over tighten them. granted, these were probably 60 yrs old, and not tapered, and most definitely swaged and/or seized in place, so a modern drum may not be as ludicrously tight.
