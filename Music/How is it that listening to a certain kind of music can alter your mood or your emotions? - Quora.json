            "answer_text": "Dr. Masaru Emoto, a doctor of alternative medicine from Japan,  has conducted many experiments on water crystals and have found that  words and music have both positive and negative effect on water molecules. He put  water between two speakers and turned on a specific piece of music for  several hours. Then the water was frozen and photographed by Dr. Emoto. Classical music such as those by Beethoven and Bach resulted into  beautiful water crystals.  These results by Dr. Emoto and other scientists since then have shown  that some music has healing properties and others don\u2019t. What\u2019s even  more amazing is that music actually has an effect on non-living,  physical matter. Since 80% of our bodies are made up of water...so listening to a certain kind of music can alter your mood.                                 Another reason for this is listening to music stimulates not only the Auditory cortex of the brain,  but also the Limbic system--which is the seat of the full range of our emotions. So music can stimulate emotional responses such as  relaxation, excitement, rage, loving feelings, sadness, anxiety, etc.",

            "answer_text": "Surprisingly, yeah. The music that someone listens to can affect them long-term as well. For example, if you\u2019re feeling sad and you play a cheerful, happy song, you start feeling better. But when you\u2019re sad and you play some sad songs, you stay that way for a longer amount of time. But when you listen to a specific type of song for a long time, you start to feel the emotions that the song\u2019s conveying. I guess that\u2019s why a person can \u201cseem like they listen to\u201d a certain type of music. ",
