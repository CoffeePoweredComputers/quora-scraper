            "answer_text": "That\u2019s quite a subjective question, which really amounts to a survey. But I\u2019ll answer it because I just finished watching the first season of MasterChef Canada, and I was pondering how I felt about it. And I won\u2019t be watching any more seasons. So far I\u2019ve watched the first seasons of the Australian, UK (revival), US, and now the Canadian franchise as well as the first season of the junior shows of the US and Australia. The Aussies are light years beyond the rest of them IMO, though the junior US show is also much better than its adult counterpart (imagine Gordon Ramsey without swearing and temper tantrums). I don\u2019t usually watch reality shows because I don\u2019t think there is much \u201dreality\u201d featured; instead we get cheap drama, and I am sorry, but no matter how much other people seem to like that (better to watch other people\u2019s lives fall apart than dealing with your own problems?), I just can\u2019t stand it. There is still too much drama for me even in the Australian show, contestants are too easily \u201cgutted\u201d by a setback, every tear is milked, stupid questions about \u201chow does it feel\u201d to lose are all too frequent, and the writing for the presenter\u2019s lines is overwrought \u2014 we\u2019re talking about a cooking show, not life and death \u2014 but overall the tone of the show has won me over. I like how the contestants behave with each other. There\u2019s no cut-throat \u201canything to win\u201d. You can\u2019t fake most of the camaraderie. I also like how the judges treat the contestants. Reality shows often fall entirely short on respect, and here there is a lot of it. The judges are clearly decent people, and they seem to actually care about the contestants and their journey and passion for cooking, and are interested in helping them succeed. We get small glimpses of the life in the MasterChef residence (nothing intrusive), and of the judges having dinner with the contestants, and it\u2019s all quite convivial. That atmosphere is a solid departure from what\u2019s normal for reality shows, and I appreciate it. I like seeing people grow through a difficult experience. The Australian show also has hugely more episodes (70 or so compared with 15 for the Canadians), and consequently we get much more familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the contestants, and come to know them better. The Australian show, because it goes easy on the drama, features a lot more cooking. We also get master classes where two of the judges themselves (the ones who are actual chefs; the third is a food critic) cook their own takes on the various challenges the contestants faced during the week. Recipes are given (also published on the Network Ten site), and one can follow them easily. The chefs give lots of little tips, and often show how a contestant\u2019s dish could have been improved \u2014 it\u2019s very instructive and a bit of a relief from the competition. In addition, there are opportunities for winning contestants to get short master classes from famous Australian chefs. In short, the experience of watching it is pleasant and educational, and it\u2019s easier for me to sympathize with the contestants and their tribulations. I\u2019ll continue watching the additional Australian seasons while I\u2018ll not bother with the others, except the junior US show. Maybe most telling is that after the other shows I didn\u2019t feel like cooking anything, while the Australian show had me buy decent pots (no, not the ones used on the show) and venture a bit further ahead in my own sad, culinary trials. EDIT: I\u2019m now almost at the end of the 3rd season, and I no longer recommend it, except for the master class episodes. What had begun to irk me already has become worse, what I liked has diminished, and it\u2019s now clear that this show, too, is way too staged and edited and dramatized, and that by no means \u201cthe best\u201d amateur cooks get promoted \u2014 the judges (more likely the producers) obviously favoured certain people. I\u2019m also wondering how much of the camaraderie (and the free-flowing tears) come about because the contestants are people in what really amounts to a hostage situation \u2014 sequestered in a house, not allowed to talk to their loved ones except for a 10-min phone call once a week. WTF! Had I known this beforehand I would have probably never bothered to watch it at all. I won\u2019t even finish watching this one; it\u2019s all too mawkish and artificial. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s difficult to answer such a question. What has to be remembered is that the Masterchef franchise is audience centric and the format is changed to suit the 40 or so countries that produce a Masterchef programme. What may appear to be a great version in one country, may have little or no appeal to the audience in another country. When the original Masterchef programme was developed in the UK back in 1990, it was a pure cookery competition. There were no big prizes, very little in the way of back stories - just cooking and being judged for the food that was created. Today, the UK version still, very much, follows the original format because that\u2019s how British audiences like it. When the franchise went global, reality TV productions had started to take off. So, foreign producers decided to adapt the format by incorporating a higher level of production-induced drama and tension into the programme. That\u2019s what their audiences wanted, so that\u2019s what they were given. Today, versions such as the Australian and American productions have escalated the cookery competition concept into something that is now pure reality TV that focuses more on drama, conflict and, in the case of the US version, even abuse and bitchiness among the contestants. The awarding of a big cash prize and book publishing deals adds an extra layer of hard-nosed competitiveness to the programme. As a result, many of the international versions tend to make cooking a secondary consideration, preferring instead to create a programme where the audience can witness conflict, sad back stories, back-stabbing and all the stuff that reality TV fans thrive on. All enhanced by judicious editing and dramatic music that often drowns out what\u2019s actually going on in the competition. So, the Australian version is obviously going to be the best version for Australians and the US version is clearly the best for US audiences - they\u2019ve been designed and produced with their respective audience and commercial ratings in mind. Ultimately, the whole franchise has been a huge success for it\u2019s UK creators and has become one of the most popular cookery competitions world wide and whilst UK audiences do get the opportunity of seeing foreign versions on subscription channels, the audience that enjoys those tense, reality TV versions is a completely different audience that tunes into the original version screened by the BBC.
