            "answer_text": "Hello! I\u2019m looking for the name of a piece of classical music. Can you help? (Yes, I wrote an answer to my own question in the hope that someone may scroll past it and decide to help me!) It is an orchestral piece in Eb major and in 4/4. The melody is:  This is played by the violins as the piano plays ornamentations/arpeggiations over it (which means it may be a piano concerto - alternatively it could just be neoclassical so there's a piano in the orchestra). Later, the clarinet plays this melody. It is either from the classical period (eg Mozart or early Beethoven) or is neoclassical (which is increasingly my suspicion). My sister and I heard it in an episode on TV and have been trying to find it for a while now so any help is welcome :) I\u2019m trying to prove to her that Quora can do this! (We have tried to use Shazam but it didn't recognise the piece, likely due to the talking over it as it is was just background music in the episode. And we can\u2019t find the episode saying what music was used anywhere.) ",
