            "answer_text": "Most of the time it is not really the issue of royalty fee, but is the licensing fee. There is a distinction between the two: Royalty fee: relates very much to the exposure the final work. For example, if you're using the background music for a YouTube video, the royalty fee would be affected by the number of views the video will eventually get. You'll need to pay more if the video gets more views.Licensing fee: refers to the compensation you pay to the artist for a licensed use of his/her copywrited music, the amount depends largely on what the music will be used for (i.e. whether personal, commercial, local, global, etc. ) and sometimes are paid on a per year basis (instead of a one-off, use-forever payment). If you google for royalty-free music, you'll indeed find many sites offering that. But do read the fine print. Because:A. \"free to download\" does not mean you're free to use it wherever. Some sites run on an honor code basis, meaning they'll allow you to download (for free) the full track so that you can test out the product, if and when you've decided to use the track in your final works (e.g. video, presentation, etc.), you then purchase a license for that particular use.B. \"Royalty-free\" does not mean at no cost. It just means that they don't charge any royalty fee for the track. So it make more sense to say \"free royalty-free music\", if you don't want to pay a dime. But then..C. \"Licensing fee\". Licensing fee is usually the final but most important (cause it's usually the priciest) element you need to look out for. Some sites are more upfront/clear/visible about the fact that they charge licensing fee and also provide a clear pricing structure. Others (a larger portion unfortunately) are not so. Its hidden in their FAQ list or another page called \"license\" which is only visible if you scroll down all the way to the footer (and its not on footer of all the pages). You get the idea. This info is collected from researching to curate audio sites for YouTube videos. The tracks you find are usually music, sound effects or loops.
