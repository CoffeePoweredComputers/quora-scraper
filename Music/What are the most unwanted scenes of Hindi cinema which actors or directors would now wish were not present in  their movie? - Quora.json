            "answer_text": "I think it must be none other than the feverish crowd-attracting item  numbers in the Bollywood movies.      First of all, these lewd acts portray nothing more than a gross objectification of women and that too in a country that is still struggling to provide fundamental rights and due respect to women. A scantily-clad maiden dancing on equally shameful lyrics among men with seemingly insatiable carnal appetites is just like Nemo (Finding Nemo (2003 movie)) in the scene below:   She can wiggle, swiggle and wriggle, but there's no way out! Secondly, these acts are a huge burden financially for producers and intellectually for directors. The rates of hiring a well established face (like Katrina Kaif, Malaika Arora Khan, Kareena Kapoor, and who knows who else!) for the item numbers is usually quite high, notwithstanding the humongous expenses over sets, costumes and side-actors required for a single item song. Obviously, such costs are paid, and are paid big! Still money must not be the only factor in film-making; sometimes a love to make them is as contributing a factor as money could ever be. Thirdly, such scenes affect as much the viewers as the film production crew involved, if not more. The viewer who sits for two and a half to three hours in a movie theatre is definitely taking home more than the sheer pleasure from a great story. Instead of appreciating the story-telling scheme, the acting and the emotions portrayed in the film, he starts seeing everything and everybody with superficial mindset of judging by the \"cover\". Sanity is long gone when he sees women with \"suggestive\" apparels. Who knows domestic violence, women trafficking, gang-rapes might just be the direct consequence of such visuals. Wikipedia enlists 23 broad categories of violence against women, and these are the ones well encountered in urban life. Perhaps other countless ways of molestation unbeknownst to us still thrive in the darkness of the villages. Every third of the women has suffered from such kind of violence. This fact is adequate in itself to suggest that the people in Bollywood, who seem to crave for money more than anything in life, should not give yet another reason to add to the sufferings of women at large. So Ms. Katrina Kaif, it'd be better if you rather gulp down a pauwaa of wisdom!    I myself don't think that the directors/actors would think otherwise. But of course, this is my opinion towards the topic and the comments are welcome heartily. ",
