            "answer_text": "Well it all depends on what kind of music, you could tap your hands on a piece of furniture and hum a melody, you could learn an actual instrument that is designed for music, if you wanted to record your music you could either use a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) or something such as a multi-track recorder, if you use a DAW you have access to plug ins and synths and effects and can even use samples that you can either rip from the internet or real life via a microphone, if you want to record say a guitar into your DAW of choice you will most likely need an Audi Interface, if you wanted to use a multitrack you would need to use effects units to generate any desired effects such as echo or reverb, if you want to make electronic music without a DAW it's good to get some synths, sequencers, drum machines etc though you can use these with DAWs too, but again you would have to learn the instruments before you can play them. If you have access to all the above and wish to know where to start on producing a song then there are a few ways, you could have a song in your head in which case you would recreate it the best you could, this is where a strong knowledge of synthesis/sound design is helpful, however you can just start playing around until you discover your song, building on it from scratch, its best to start with the focus of the song, such as if you want a strong beat start with the beat, if you want a strong lead start with the lead, obviously we all want a strong everything but all songs have a drawing point, it doesn't mean the melody has to be worse than the beat or vice versa. After all this and you've completed your song you may want to look into mastering, though it is not necessary unless you want to release music and want people to hear it clear and professional sounding. So it all boils down to what kind of music and for what purpose? The simple answer is just do it. And if you want to make GOOD music then just keep doing it, refine your craft, make it for yourself, others approval is just a bonus and it will come with time as you improve. ",

            "answer_text": "1- Learn your instrument and keep on studying it. The more you know how to use your instrument, the more ideas you can use to pull from. I include singing as an instrument. 2- Always write new things. Sure, you may not create anything worthwhile for a month or two, but eventually, something will come out. I heard a quote that said you have to write 1,000 pieces of music before you start enjoying your own work. I think this is accurate. 3- Study other music. It goes without saying, but a lot of people skip this step. Learn a bit about structure, learn what makes a chorus stand out. Learn about the various tricks that are used in music. Modulating up a half-step is a cheap way to make a section sound exciting for example, but there are plenty of more tricks that you are bound to miss from passive listening. Don\u2019t get stuck in a hole of only listening to (in your example) female singer-songwriter music if you are aiming to become one. No one who plays at a professional level in any genre is isolated to their own style of work. Explore rap, heavy metal, classical, jazz, country, EDM, pop, etc. Really challenge yourself to listen and understand this music. I\u2019ve met girls who could melt your heart with their playing, but when I jammed with them, they\u2019ll pull out their electric and shred mean leads while I just lay down some rhythm. 4- Don\u2019t get stuck on bad ideas. Don\u2019t get stuck on good ideas that go nowhere. Trust that writing is a process, and part of that process is taking on 100 failures to get than one good idea out. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh wow, tons of ways. Get a looper app on your phone and make vocal loops. Buy a cheap guitar or keyboard, learn how to play a little bit, and start writing songs. Lots of modern music is pretty simple, just 3\u20134 chords, so the entry bar is low. Get a little tape recorder and record yourself humming and drumming on things. Get software like Fruity Loops, Ableton Live, or Garageband and start playing around. Go to a local college and book time in a piano room - play just one note a time and see how it sounds. What sounds do you like? What patterns do you like? Do you like a lot of notes or a few? Do you like loud music or quiet music? Do you like it to have words? What about drums? What about melodies? Do you want to make it alone or do you want to make it with other people? Do you want to write it, play it, or both? Sorry I can\u2019t be more specific, but your question is super vague. There are a billion different ways to create your own music, and a billion more that we haven\u2019t yet invented. The first step is to just start doing it, instead of asking vague questions on Quora. (Sorry if that seems harsh, pretend I\u2019m patting your shoulder when I say this, like \u2018aw shucks buddy!\u2019) You have an amazing journey into your own relationship with music to take. You probably kind of know how you can start making music already, so just go do it. If you can provide more info about yourself and music and what you mean, I\u2019m happy to offer more specific advice. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "For me, I think more of the musical content than I do over the technical aspects of recording.  Certainly they all play a part in the process at some point, but a lot depends on your specific , intentions.   If you want to write a song that you could perform equally well at a campfire as in a music hall, for example, I think it starts from learning songs and bits of songs from other people.  It can be important to have a grasp on some of the mechanics and learning which notes seem to naturally follow or precede other notes, at least as a starting point.  Exposing ourselves to other music by many other writers, singers, performers, etc., can lead us to thinking of or playing things we may not have considered.   I will say that most of my songs I consider at least respectable, came out all on their own and my role was to try and emulate what I was hearing in my head.  One song of mine, in particular, came partially from trying to learn to play another well known song, but I kept making a mistake and always at the same part.   Some how it merged with aspects of a few other songs I had been practicing and something truly unique just showed up, when I wasn't expecting it. I think too, that being able to allow our emotions out can influence our ability to write.  We may need to tweak things a bit to keep it partially under control, or at least keep it tame enough it can be performed, but I believe that if music can move the soul it must also come from the soul moving.  I am convinced that if we look at all the amazing songs that we have ever heard, none of them were mechanically written on purpose.  The composer/writer certainly intended on writing something, but for the most part the best parts of it came out when they weren't fully paying attention to what was coming out. I hope find something in here useful in your music. :-)  ",

Despite the greater social commentary on TV looking to create and manufacture pop stars, at the end of the day, you're going to try and make music, and you're going to suck at it. For a long time. Like way longer than you want to suck. But eventually...you will get better. \u201cWhen I think about kids watching a TV show like American Idol or The Voice, then they think, \u2018Oh, OK, that\u2019s how you become a musician, you stand in line for eight fucking hours with 800 people at a convention center and\u2026 then you sing your heart out for someone and then they tell you it\u2019s not fuckin\u2019 good enough.\u2019 Can you imagine?\u201d he implores. \u201cIt\u2019s destroying the next generation of musicians! Musicians should go to a yard sale and buy an old fucking drum set and get in their garage and just suck. And get their friends to come in and they\u2019ll suck, too. And then they\u2019ll fucking start playing and they\u2019ll have the best time they\u2019ve ever had in their lives and then all of a sudden they\u2019ll become Nirvana. Because that\u2019s exactly what happened with Nirvana. Just a bunch of guys that had some shitty old instruments and they got together and started playing some noisy-ass shit, and they became the biggest band in the world. That can happen again!

Choose one or two that interest you the most and get a tutor to help you learn through hands on help and homework tasks. Eventually you will be able to join and play along with a music club or a band to develop your skills further. By now you probably would have figured out which instrument you have most passion for.  Additionally you may have the opportunity to do an evening course in your area, and even try out courses like home recording and production. There are many online courses but they will only work for you if you have extra motivation since it's not so easy to follow music courses, particularly with instruments without face to face support in my opinion.

Limiting is your best friend.While eqing vocals, use eqs with knobs(Analog).

Audiotechnica will do the job.Don't forget the stereo field! Kicks and sub bass should always be in mono. Widen the guitars, leads, pads and don't forget to layer them.Mixing is the ultimate mastering. Don't expect mastering as a diamond production mine where you put in coal and get diamonds in return. Your mix should sound great with no mastering on it.Always use a reference track and compare the dynamics. Can't stress on how important this is.Leave a 6 dB headroom for the mastering. I suggest that you put a limiter on the master and keep a track of how it'll sound after the headroom is removed.Use transient designers.That's it from me. Good luck!

            "answer_text": "Really good question\u2026.. I think you can break this into three parts: Learning grammar: Yes, music grammar seems boring at first but to write a story you need to know the language. I won\u2019t tell you to practice scales every other day but once in a while you can sit down and learn some basic scales (basic till Pentatonic scales). It seems a bore in the beginning but once you learn how to apply them boom you start making music automatically. If you want to become a pro then you will have to learn a lot about scales(yes you will have to make it a daily habit then).Copying other players : As they say great artists steal . Practicing and picking up other guitarists tabs is a good way to learn how to build music. What you need to do is copy, tamper and fit it in your parts. You don\u2019t need to copy the whole solo or riff but copy a part of it and use it somewhere else. Same with techniques. This kind of improves you overall as a musician. Learn from the greats and afterwards you will find you can write your own chapter.Listen to different types of music: Don\u2019t just sit and listen to mainstream. Learn to listen to songs without vocals. The more you listen the better you get with your melodies. Also listen to different instruments. Kenny G , Mozart, Metallica etc etc \u2026.",

Just play around with anything that can create sound--wich is almost everything. Simply follow your intuition. If you want to make a specific form of music, you'd have to understand the music you want to make and learn to use the tools wich are required for whatever it is you want to make. I guess the only thing all music has in common is the \"playing around\"-aspect... like any creative endeavor, music as well involves a lot of trial and error, so~, if you want to make music of any kind you should actually have a liking or at least a very high tolerance of that. Thing is, this question is incredibly vague... If you ask for something more specific, like \"how do I play this\" or \"how do I make this sound like that\", etc., then one could quiet easily help... however, a question as broad as this is pretty much unanswereable and ultimately the answer might be rather personal to whomever you ask.

However before you embark on your music production journey, I would advise you to pay attention to the following. Desire: I believe that before you can start to produce your own music, you must have the desire first. You don\u2019t have to the most talented but if you have a burning desire, you can go places.Knowledge: Get the basics right investing in your gear. That means learn as much as you can about music (music theory), piano chords, scales, etc. You don\u2019t have to go to a formal College but you can teach yourself basic piano or guitar. This will give you the confidence and competence to produce music.Software: When you are or feel ready to produce your first beat or song, you are going to need software or DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Software will allow you to program, record and edit your music.For more, please read this article. It explains everything in detail and will give you a better insight. Good Luck! ",

Technically there's a set of rules that governs or at least suggest how a Melody should be constructed over chord progressions. the composer might decide that he wants the song to be sad and use a minor chord. Over this minor chord he will construct a Melody that fits the characteristics of the minor chord etc. Inspirationally? Beethoven often sat and watched nature. He would write music that represented a spring storm or a babbling Brook. He would compose gentle melodies or powerful symphonies based on music he head in his head as he watched nature in it's varying forms. John Lennon was walking up a slope near his home. When at the top he saw a man who looked strange and seemed to be talking to him. When John reached the top of the hill the man was simply gone. There's no place he could have gone but just vanished. This incident triggered \u201cFool on the Hill\u201d by John Lennon. I sit in a in a cafe with my guitar. The music I compose is based on the people that I see at various tables. There's this sad girl over in the corner, the intellectual reading a book, the lovers in that corner and the group of Happy reunited friends. Each situation triggers an emotion which in turn triggers a melody. ",

The same way that drawing happens in your eye--you can only draw what you can see with your mind. The best way to start is with a percussion instrument. Rhythm is the basis of music, and playing percussion is only about rhythm, it strips away all melodic and harmonic aspects. Just practice for 2 or 3 hours every day until you crack the code and then keep practicing. ",

What kind of emotion do you want your music to invoke? Learn modal theory, harmony, and arranging music. When you identify your goals and attributes, you can create a framework of your objectives and techniques. Modal theory is a gateway toward understanding how to apply your efforts to produce your desired results. If you write lyrics you can shape the words to obtain many variations and let the words determine the chords. Writing poetry is similar. I use an analogy written by Robert Frost. I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but here goes! Someone had asked Robert Frost how to write a poem. His response was: wait until something happens to you. Describe the events and write down every thing about the experience. The time of day, the color of the sky, the view of the landscape, the feel of a breeze, sounds of the woods, ect., ect., ad infinatum. When this task is done, ride the words until you have poem! The same goes for music. ",

But here I go anyways. I don't think there's really such a thing as the best music. It's very subjective and difficult to compare different genres styles and instruments. You just can't do it. I would say try and learn (with the goal of mastering) an important instrument for the genre you like the most. Better yet an instrument that doesn't belong to one specific genre, so that you can move across boundaries. Guitar is a good place to start (although I would argue if you can afford the time piano is the best base musically) because you can easily transfer that knowledge to a wide range of other instruments. Then just do what you like - you'll always perform your best when you love the music your playing. Find some local guys who want to start or enlarge their band. From there you just gotta do what you love and use anything you can to claw your way into recognition. Try composing your own stuff, play at bars or restaurants and if even though you might not get that big break into the world of international fame with enough time and hard work you might. If you want I can link to a bunch of small local bands that managed to get their name out there and do well for themselves - it's hard but not impossible. But really, the best music boils down to what you like. I believe the best music you can do is the music you love - maybe it's your favorite song, or one you've composed that you just can't improve on anymore. When you play that song, and it turns out perfect and you feel that moment of bliss that we all strive for, that's when you'll have done the best music. You sure can't do any damn better than that.
