            "answer_text": "To put bluntly, as is they won\u2019t sound very enjoyable. Focus on the \u2018as is\u2019 . First I must assume you have a very capable pair of studio monitors. At least 150 bucks that is. Now if you listen to them straight up on your phone or laptop they may sound \u2018accurate\u2019 but lifeless. Sort of. Studio monitors are supposed to be flat, completely neutral. But that doesn\u2019t sound pleasing to most people. For general music a slightly v shaped (scooped) frequency curve is preferable. Some people prefer warmer sound signature (more low end and less treble), others prefer a brighter sound (more high end). And this fine tuning can be done with a suitable dac/amp. This will provide for a much more enjoyable listening experience. And after this fine tuning to your preference a good studio monitor will sound great for your regular music listening as well. Not as amazing as open back though still pretty good (studio monitors are almost always closed back, as while audio mixing you don\u2019t want external factors affecting the sound). This is why I mentioned that it is assumed one has an above average studio monitors(DT 770/880 Pro 150$) as they will have capable drivers which would benefit from a dac and the fine tuning. Something like the Shure SRH440 (99$) most certainly didn\u2019t benefit from an external dac, trust me I tried. Happy listening. ",

Edit: Why would someone listen to songs using studio monitors. They are used for live tracking in studios and not for listening to music. But they can be used to listen to music. ",
