            "answer_text": "There is no highest note that can be played on a violin. Why? Because whatever note one plays, there is always another higher one right next to it. The higher you go, the closer the next higher note is. It is theoretically possible to play notes above the range of human hearing. There are, however, highest notes that are practical to play on the instrument. The highest note considered part of the playable range by most composers would be the G, two octaves and a third above the E string. I may have seen a higher note required in a score 2 or 3 times in my long career. Above that, the reach required by the player\u2019s left hand becomes very difficult, and the vibrating string length becomes too short to respond well to the bow. If we want to go beyond that limit, another is presented by the end of the fingerboard. The note heard is determined by the vibrating length of the string. A finger pressing the string to the fingerboard stops the vibration below that point. There is no effective way to \u201cstop\u201d a string beyond the end of the fingerboard except maybe by pinching it between a finger and thumb, which would be neither practical nor musical. I could probably determine approximately what note is at the end of my fingerboard, but at that point the notes are so close together it would be difficult to determine which one was at the precise end. Besides, I don\u2019t care to subject myself to the unpleasant sounds that would be created there. ",

            "answer_text": "We really stop counting above 7th position. Counting positions is really an educational aid to permit instructors to communicate with students. At an advanced level position numbering is really only used when discussing positions with colleagues. I am aware where 9th position is (first finger on high G or Gb or G#) and that I can get to high C (or C#) and to High E with an extension (stretch.) At that level of the stratosphere we are really playing by ear, and if you have any other than the thinnest of fingers you are in finger replacement territory. (That means you are actually sliding your whole hand position downward to fit the finger on the string. You will also notice if you watch a great virtuoso playing in those positions that they will often use the 3rd finger (which in violin-speak is the \u201cRing\u201d finger) because you actually can reach higher with that finger than with the \u201cPinkie\u201d (4 finger.) Note violinists notate fingers differently from pianists\u2026 we don\u2019t count the thumb. (I actually don\u2019t know how cellists count fingers because the thumb is actually used in advanced techniques.) Violist don\u2019t count at all (viola joke!) ",
