At the Disco; whatever\u2019s your fancy. After all it\u2019s what you feel in the mood for, I don\u2019t know what kind of music you like. But when I was feeling a little crushy on someone I listened to Shut Up and Dance with Me for weeks, until I got sick of the song. XD Edit: Oh I just reread your question. Hmmm do you mean when they\u2019re ignoring you or something? At first I was like it\u2019s obvious love songs, but if they\u2019re ignoring you then hey sad songs by Shawn Mendes ",
