            "answer_text": "Prior to grunge it was guns n Rose's and poison. I also like motley crue, faith no more, midnight oil and inxs. When grunge came out it put me onto other music, all the other bands remained prized possessions in my music collection but I also grew to love the music of Red hot chilli peppers, alice in chains, slayer, mettalica and pantera. By the mid to late 90s I had acquired more purchasing power and began to check out the older music that influenced the music I grew up with. From this I developed a live of the Beatles, rolling stones, creedence Clearwater revival, jimi hendrix, cream, led zeppelin and Kiss in particular. To this day I live red hot chilli peppers and Kiss above all others. In addition to that I love some rap artists, sir mix a lot, round dmc, eminem, nwa and also the pynk band misfits, in their Glenn danzig and Michael graves incarnations, plus German Folk band Faun and Faroe Island artist Eivor Palsdottir.
