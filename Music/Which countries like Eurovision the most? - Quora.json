British/Spanish/German/French/Russian/Italian tv numbers: BBC One2018: 6.9m #1 tv show that night, beated BGT2019: 6.9m (41.7% SHR)La 12018: 7.17m (43,5% SHR) Highest Eurovision tv number from the last 10 years2019: 5.449m (36,7% SHR) #1 show that nightDas Erste:2018: 7.71m (33,3% SHR) + One 0,5m #1 tv show that night2019: 7.59m (34.3% SHR) + One: 0,49m #1 tv show that night14-49 demographic: 3.28m (42.2% SHR)France 22018: 5.15m (28,5% SHR) #1 tv show that night beated The Voice final2019: 4.79m (30.2% SHR) #1 tv show that nightRussia 1/First Channel2018: 1,5m (11.6% SHR) - First ChannelNo Russian singer in the final2019: 3.2m (28.2% SHR) - Russia 1Rai 12018: 3.42m (18,63% SHR) - Italy just recently joined back to ESC2019: 3.539m (19.7% SHR) - #2 tv show that night after a local talent showOf course, different countries have different number of population (for example more people live in Germany than in Italy). BUT I also added the share number. That shows how many percentage of tv viewers watched that specific show in their national market. So that means is from the big countries Spain and Germany like the Eurovision the most. I would also add the Nordic countries, because their national song contest are very popular in their countries, so if those songs reach the final, their tv viewer numbers will go up in the Grand Final as well. UPDATE: I\u2019ve also added the tv numbers from 2019 as well UPDATE2: I\u2019ve also added the Russian tv numbers as well ",

Although they have only around 450,000 people, they consistently hold a national final with around 20 entries to select their Eurovision entry, all performed by Maltese residents. Two of their artists which have entered their national final multiple times entered San Marino\u2019s national final this year, and one won. They have declared that if they won, the day on which they won would be a national holiday and that they would dedicate the whole country to Eurovision for the week they would host the countest. And, last but not least, they have been accused in multiple years of bribing juries. ",
