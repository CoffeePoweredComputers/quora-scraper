            "answer_text": "Pigment Markham's \u201cHere comes the Judge\u201d is considered to be a proto rap song. The following proto rap artists have even more claim to the title of releasing the 1st rap song being more consistent in their delivery of similar material over their recorded output but are still considered Proto Rap. THE WATTS PROPHETS  Black in a White World THE LAST POETS  Debut album \u201cThe Last Poets\u201d was released in 1970 with others following in the 1970s. GIL SCOTT-HERON  Gil Scott Heron - The Revolution will not be Televised But Poet Langston Hughes had produced albums with Charles Mingus Jazz instrumental backing on the fantasy label in the 1950s and these great artists are in that tradition, poetry with instrumental backing - Proto Rap. Hip-Hop (or Rap) as we know it today came from the South Bronx in the 1970s (influenced by Jamaican toasting over records) with innovative Jamaican born DJ Kool Herc repeatedly playing the \u201cbreak\u201d section of records to excite dancers at Block Parties and is part of the Break Dancing, Graffiti Writing & Rap trilogy that made up early Bronx Rap Music. Pigmeat Markham is not in that tradition and is Proto Rap not Hip Hop. Read \u201cCan't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip Hop Generation\u201d by Jeff Chang for more background on the advent of early Hip Hop. ",
