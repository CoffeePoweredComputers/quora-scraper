            "answer_text": "It depends on many things, the biggest being whether you can stand the crowds/frenzy of Coachella. There\u2019s pretty much no way around it and at some point you\u2019re going to be unable to move because you\u2019re surrounded by a group of sweaty dudes, whether that\u2019s in a tent or just walking out of the festival at night. So when deciding to go to Coachella for any reason that should be your first consideration (for the record, I don\u2019t love crowds, and I\u2019ve found the crowds at Coachella to be tolerable because the vibe is so positive/exciting). If the music you\u2019re trying to catch is the headliners / prime time shows in the main tents, then it might not be worth it for you if you are attending primarily for the music unless you buy VIP tickets and can skip lines and be in the front. These shows are almost always incomprehensibly crowded and hectic. Also, the rap/hip hop shows are usually pretty crazy and might too much. If you are going just for music generally and aren\u2019t tied to specific artists, it\u2019s certainly worth it as there are literally hundreds of shows. Even for some of the popular artists, if their sets are earlier in the day you\u2019ll have a good experience as it generally doesn\u2019t get crazy until late afternoon/early evening. If you\u2019re trying to catch DJ sets, you\u2019re in luck because the Yuma tent is always a good time and not too crowded, same with the Do Lab. So, if you\u2019re not going for the headliners and can stand the general crowds of the festival, then you can still catch a bunch of great music, especially if it\u2019s earlier in the day. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I\u2019m a music journalist who has covered Coachella since 2013, and I can tell you that I\u2019ve discovered a lot of artists I never heard of by attending the festival and have seen a lot of artists I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have a chance to see. There are a lot of people who go for the music and enjoy going every year, but you also have the party people and the people who take selfies, but I don\u2019t have much interaction with them given I don\u2019t feel the need. My primary focus as a writer is on the music. I would recommend going during Weekend 2. It\u2019s a lot more music focused and the crowd is more of a music crowd compared to Weekend 1. ",
