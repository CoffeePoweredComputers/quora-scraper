            "answer_text": "2NE1 handsdown. They create new trends in music, fashion and concepts each time they release something new. They are the only girl band who helps in producing their album esp their group leader CL. They have covered many genres of music such as soul, ballad, pop, RnB, hip-hop, reggae, jazz, rock, electronic, punk, etc unlike other K-Pop girl groups. Most of their soul, RnB, Ballad, etc music has very good lyrics with deep and sometimes profound meanings. They have timeless quality to it, meaning you can hear it even 10/20 yrs from now on and it won't feel dated. Their music overall is not teeny candyfloss bubblegum pop with only current value which is not bad but too generic and over produced in S. Korea atm. 2NE1 saves girl band music and serious- mature listener don't have to look down upon girl band music because of them and appreciate their music. They are artists before they are an Idol as compared to other K-Pop girlbands out there. They have the best live stage ever. No girl group comes close to them in live performances. You will get goosebumps if you see their live stages even if you are not their fan. See this ''I am the BEST'' live performance from MAMA 2011. Till date I haven't seen any national/ international/ Korean performance as powerful as this.  Each of the members has their own strong personality and individual colour. They have their distinct style from each other and do not look uniformed or carbon-copy of each other. Their voices are also different and unique. They have won more international awards and recognition than any other K-Pop girl bands which itself shows that they are well revered as a K-Pop force in other parts of the world. They have charted in world billboard charts in top 10.  Their stages are always sold out. Even in their domestic performances, if you see any award functions/ shows, their live stages become the main USP and highlight of the night.  Overall they are the Bee Eee Ess Tee. ",
