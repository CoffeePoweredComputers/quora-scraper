            "answer_text": "There are two levels of VST - VST and VST3 - and two platforms - Windows and MacOS. VST3 requires a 64-bit OS, so later versions of Windows or MacOS. VST and VST3 plugins are the most common format for Windows DAWs. The only exception is Pro Tools, which uses the AAX format instead. Windows VSTs are widely available, so it\u2019s in the interest of DAW developers to use that format. On MacOS, there are likewise MacOS VST and VST3, which can be used by a wide range of DAWs, but there is also Apple\u2019s own Audio Units format, which is used by Logic and GarageBand, as well as other apps. As a Logic user, this is the format I install. As with Windows, MacOS Pro Tools uses the AAX format. VST 3 Here\u2019s a quick search for free guitar amp VSTs on KVR Audio: Free effect VST Plugins and VST3 Plugins for Windows Guitar Amp, Guitar Amp and FX Modeling, Guitar Amp Emulation or High Gain Guitar Amp Simulation ",

            "answer_text": "In most cases, yes. I found that is especially true with the freeware program Audacity. All you have to do in that one is upload the VST programs to the folder and use a midi controller. It can be a mixed bag. I been using my guitar amp as a front end for my guitar work. You have to have the firmware in your computer to work with a program like audacity. I am still a little inexperienced on other DAWS. I need to sit and experiment more. For the record, it is possible. ",

            "answer_text": "No. VST plugins come in different versions (versions 1, 2, and 3), and are made for different OSes (Mac, Windows, Linux), and for different processor architectures (32 bit, 64 bit). And then there are VST plugins that are linked to applications that could be run as standalone apps. The apps themselves support certain versions of OSes, and sometimes the software instrument itself would also work with certain versions of the application. ",
