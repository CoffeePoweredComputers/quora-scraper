            "answer_text": "Hare Krishna devotees considered it to be. After the second guitar solo, the chorus contains the Hare Krishna mantra sung in the background. The belief is that the Hare Krishna mantra is in and of itself divine, and that to listen to the mantra is to be blessed, whether you believe or not. And according to that belief, George Harrison did a great thing when he recorded that song. He\u2019s been blessing people every time they listen to the song. Or at least so the Hare Krishna devotees in Atlanta believed. It is, in any case, completely consistent with their beliefs. Disclaimer: I liked the Hare Krishna devotees. I visited their temple often, but I never joined their religion and they never pressured me into doing so. ",
