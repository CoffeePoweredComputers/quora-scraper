            "answer_text": "I built Spotify Playlists which currently have more than 60000 playlists. One aspect of quality could be the randomness of it. I.e. are all artists unique in the playlist. On my site you can sort by randomness (plus filter on the amount of songs) so this could give you higher quality playlists - but it depends on what you're looking for :) ",

Backwoods Blues : Inspired by 1930s-1940s blues. Some foot tapping, front porch sitting, blues type of blues. Fans of Muddy Waters, Lightnin Hopkins, Blind Willie, etc. will enjoy these tunes.  Cold Surf : Inspired by 2013-2016 Chill Wave genre. Fans of The XX, Polica, Jungle, Caribou, etc. will like this one.  Melancholy Magic : Inspired by The Cure, The Smiths, New Order, Joy Division, The Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, and others. This is the playlist I put on when I'm having a down day - it's raining and I'm doing laundry or something.  Reggae Retrospect : Mainly 1960s-70s Reggae. Tunes other than Bob Marley although he and The Wailers do make an appearance. Think Tenor Saw, Sister Nancy, Scratch Perry, etc. If you're into Bob Marley, consider giving this a listen - many of these folks were his inspiration.  ",
