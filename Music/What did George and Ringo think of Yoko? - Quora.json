            "answer_text": " RINGO STARR & GEORGE HARRISON. As we all get older our views and reminisces change but sometimes we keep thinks locked away to preserve the integrity of friendships, so too did George Harrison and Ringo Starr.  GEORGE AND JOHN. Let me start by saying Ringo Starr was in tears when he was interviewed about the last words that George Harrison said to him when dying in Switzerland. Ringo went to visit his good friend and was telling George that he Ringo was going to Boston to visit his daughter who had a brain tumour, George, bedridden, looked at him and said, \u201cDo you want me to go with you?\u201d this, a dying man trying to support his good friend Ringo.  PAUL AND JOHN. Ringo was always known to be a private man and peacemaker who tried to maintain a level of dignity despite how he truly felt about Yoko during the Beatles last days as a band. None of the three Beatles, George, Paul and Ringo were happy that the band's days were numbered when John told them in mid 1969 that he was going to leave the band. The public were officially told about the band breaking up in April 1970. George himself wasn't waiting around and left in January 1970.  Kyoko, John and Yoko. 1966, Yoko and John met in England when she was there promoting her art, John came to her exhibition after Paul McCartney met Yoko who came to Paul's home enquring about something or having access to their catalogue, Paul told Yoko he would have to check with John first as co-writer on some 300+ Lennon-McCartney songs.  Yoko and John Lennon outside their Dakota Apartment where John was shot Dec 8, 1980. Once Yoko had John's interest she never let go of him, she'd already had a daughter Kyoko to an American guy named Cox and spent years in the family courts, although she had custody of the child, her husband kept moving around the United States and overseas. John supported her through these years, far more then he did regarding his own son Julian letter to Cynthia.  1963, The Beatles, (see link at bottom for more pics from this photographic session.) Yoko had three miscarriages to John before giving birth to Sean Lennon.  RINGO AND JOHN. Everytime the Beatles were in the studio working on an album (three albums between 1966\u20131969) Yoko would be in tue studio, not control room.or waiting room constantlynstaring at Johm ajd distracting him which really pissed off George, Ringo and Paul.  George and John Paul said he didnt want to interfere in their relationship as they were in love but he didn't want Yoko interefering in the Beatles business of recording. They didn't like Yoko but tolerated her for John's sake, right up to the point the band broke up. The Beatle women always stayed away from the studio, that is never went into the studio when they were practising, jamming or recording, Yoko knew she had total control over John and he would always put her before all others, the remaining Beatles acknowledged this sore point.  John & George As they've all gotten older they\u2019ve mellowed out more in their views and reminisces of the Beatles breakup. But many news stories, radio and tv interviews, magazine stories and biographies have had differing opinions as any hardcore Beatles fans would know. As far as Yoko was concerned she noted the spark and enthusiasm wasn't there any more, the chemistry between Paul and John had fizzled oit because of one particular reason. YOKO KEPT JOHN TO HERSELF!

            "answer_text": "The question should be If I ever heard about what George used to think of Yoko and what Ringo thinks of her. Because it is impossible to know what anybody thinks. Celebrities are human beings like all of us. So, same way people have no means to know what I think except if I express myself, we also have no means to know the thoughts of the celebrities. Important also to remember we say things that are not what we think deep inside. So my answer to the corrected question is that I never read any article or interview of Ringo on which he says what he thinks of her. But I have read many times that only John could appreciate her. Therefore Ringo also disliked her. Or disliked things she did. We also know that, nowadays, they seem to get along well and they have to. After all they own Apple corps. If Ringo was still rejecting her, not being able to talk to her,then it would be bad for business. Recently we saw some pictures of them together in an event about John Lennon. It is possible he managed to forgive her. Smart people can forgive. George said some days before his death he had forgiven her at last. It was not easy. George declared several times he could not stand her. There is even a joke he did on a TV talk show, but I am sure he meant that, on which he jumps all of sudden from the chair he was sat on because the host told him Yoko had sat in the same chair. We all know how upset he was when Yoko ate his chocolate bar\u2026It sounds so funny. But I understand him. You can do anything, but don\u2019t eat my chocolate bar. I\u2019d be furious too.LOL He also gave a declaration for the Anthology that was not included. I saw it on youtube. It was about his feelings toward her. He could feel her bad vibrations and he was sure she stepped in to separate them. Of course he had strong reasons for that. What such an important information was not included? Obviously because she would be too angry. And she is dangerous. In spite of that, he managed to forgive her ( or course, it means he removed that pain from his heart, not that he decided to approve what she did) and even asked Paul to do the same as life is too short. It also means he knew Paul still had ressentments. And it shows how much they suffered living that situation. We can only imagine but possibly it was even more than what we think, not only because she was intervening in everything but also to see their beloved friend John being used the way he was. Gosh, she used to supply him with heroine! George was so worried he got in touch with Bob Dylan asking him to research about her. Dylan investigated and discovered only bad things about her. But when George warned John things got even worse. It seems John, for the first and last time, hit George physically. Anyway, Paul said that, because George asked him to forgive her, he really did. I do hope so because it is true those who don\u2019t forgive suffer even more and even get sick, while the other one remains fine and getting better all the time. ",
