            "answer_text": "Every single minute, 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube. 5 billion videos are watched every day. There is no doubt that there are videos tied for 0 views. Every time a video is uploaded, it has 0 views. There is no one least viewed video. If you\u2019d like to see a cool website, check out Petit Tube. Petit Tube loads up videos with very few views. I think the videos it loads all have less than 100 views. It\u2019s really cool to see all the random videos on the internet and know that nearly nobody has seen it (in comparison to the number of internet users). I recommended you check it out! ",
