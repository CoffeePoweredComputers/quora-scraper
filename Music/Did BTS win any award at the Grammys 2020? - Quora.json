            "answer_text": "Sadly, BTS wasn't even nominated for a GRAMMY, so no, they didn't win any award. They literally have some of the best-selling albums in the world, and they're still being left out (I personally think racism is a large part, but whatever). However, they did do a collab stage with Lil Nas X on Old Town Road/Seoul Town Road. It was originally just going to be RM, but then the whole group performed. Ngl, they did at least get to perform at the GRAMMYs which is historical for k-pop, but hopefully they at least get a nomination next year. ",

I want to see that is why I think that lady who is part of the recordings agency of The Grammys is under fire. Lil Naz invited the boys to do a collaboration on stage. That is what they did and they left. So to answer your question no they did not get a Grammy. ",
