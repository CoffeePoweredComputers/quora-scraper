            "answer_text": " There\u2019s a long list of Taylor Swift songs that you can categorized as an emotional one but I\u2019ll gonna list the songs that made me cry or bring back some sad memories I have. Soon You\u2019ll Get Better ft. Dixie Chicks. Lover came out last August 2019 and as a fan, I\u2019m so ecstatic listening to it for the first time. The album was great and all fun and romantic until I got to its 12th track, Soon You\u2019ll Get Better, and man, I did totally cry on its few seconds. The song is too personal because it is about her mom, Andrea who\u2019s battling with cancer. And the lyrics: \u201cIn doctor's-office-lighting, I didn't tell you I was scaredThat was the first time we were there\u2026\u201d \u201cDesperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too\u201d \u201cAnd I hate to make this all about meBut who am I supposed to talk to?What am I supposed to doIf there's no you?\u201d \u201cOoh-ah, soon you'll get betterOoh-ah, soon you'll get betterOoh-ah, you'll get better soon'Cause you have to\u201d  Ronan This is about a \u201cbeautiful boy who died\u201d. Taylor performed this song live on 2012 Stand Up to Cancer live after she wrote the song about a boy named Ronan who died battling with cancer at the age of four. Taylor came across a blog written by the boy\u2019s mom, Maya Thompson, and created this beautiful song and named it after the beautiful boy. \u201cI remember the drive home when the blind hopeTurned to crying and screaming, \"Why?\"Flowers piled up in the worst wayNo one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died\u201d \u201cAnd it's about to be HalloweenYou could be anything you wanted if you were still hereI remember the last day when I kissed your faceI whispered in your ear\u201d \u201cAnd what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you\u201d \u201cCome on baby with meWe're gonna fly away from hereYou were my best four years\u201d  All Too Well Ugh. This one\u2019s my personal favorite. This 5-minute song gives you the vibes of \u201cplugging your earphones, listen, lie down and cry\u201d. Taylor sang this live for the first time at the 56th Grammy Awards in 2014 and it\u2019s one of the best emotional performances I\u2019ve seen.

            "answer_text": "I think that her most emotional song is one that is severely underrated. It has an orchestra in the original version and it really just accentuates the lyrics. In the acoustic version, you can feel how emotional the song is. The song that I\u2019m talking about is called Haunted. It comes from her album \u2018Speak Now.\u2019  The video above is the original version.  This is the acoustic version. ",
