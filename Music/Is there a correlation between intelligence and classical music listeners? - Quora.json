            "answer_text": "Yes, though there are very intelligent people who aren't musical. But that has to do with pitch sense and rhythm sense, which are independent variables from IQ.  That said, classical music is generally more complicated than popular music. I love most kinds of music, so I'm not bad-mouthing popular music. But it wouldn't be popular if only, say, 5% of people can follow it.  More complicated music requires both some innate musicality and intelligence to follow.  Here's an example: Ligeti's Atmospheres, famous for being used in the star gate sequence of Stanley Kubrick's movie 2001:   (Make sure you listen to this in HD--otherwise what's there will be lost). This is difficult music even for many classical music fans, which I admit includes some who like classical music for cultural reasons more than for strictly musical ones.  Of course there's plenty of accessible classical music. The Boston Pops plays the stuff all the time, along with Andre Rieu. You don't have to be Einstein to \"get\" something as accessible as, say, Aaron Copeland's Fanfare for the Common Man:   There is popular music that's more complicated than most, of course, and which generally doesn't get the huge sales numbers--but whose subtlety gets into classical territory, such as Quicksilver Messenger Service's \"The Fool:\"   Though as with feature length cartoons that have something for the kids but also something for the grown-ups, stuff like The Fool can be enjoyed by a gaggle of stoners who might not notice the sick guitar work and other things going on in there.  Also, it probably takes more intelligence to appreciate popular and/or traditional music from a different culture, such as this greeting dance I recorded on a trip to Bali:   Lastly, there's the fact that even with light classics that aren't really any more complicated than pop music, an intelligent person can get more out of the experience. For example, here's a performance I recorded of lyric soprano Jackie Evancho singing \"Imaginer:\"   Any shmoe can tell she has a beautiful voice, and the song isn't that complicated. However, it might require more smarts to hear everything she's doing to deliver this experience, such as understanding her use of passagio, portamento, phrasing etc. I'd call this piece an example of light classics.  I conclude that there's a correlation between intelligence and appreciating classical music, but with a lot of qualifications to that statement. ",

            "answer_text": "The fact that classical music contains more of the elements of music than most other styles lends itself to a more musically elite audience.  Everyone can appreciate classical music, but to truly enjoy it and know it one must be able to appreciate more elements of music than can be found in rock, blues, metal, folk, pop, jazz et al.   I'm speaking purely from a theoretical, technical standpoint.  The passion and emotional side of music can't be taught, nor can it be lessened or increased by the intelligence of the listener, but the appreciation of classical music is comparable to appreciating higher math as opposed to simple arithmetic.  Or appreciating gourmet cooking as opposed to a bowl of cereal.  I love cereal.  I love and appreciate and use arithmetic almost every day.  But they're commonplace.  Easily understood and attainable with little effort or knowledge.  The same can be said of music other than classical and those forms strongly influenced by classical; ie. progressive or fusion forms of all the earlier genres I listed.    So in turn, I wouldn't say there's necessarily a correlation between general intelligence and classical music listeners, but perhaps a correlation between musical intelligence and classical music listeners.  That being said, most people of higher intelligence are drawn toward things in life that challenge or feed their desire for higher knowledge, so it may stand to reason that some of higher intelligence are drawn toward music with a higher degree of technicality.  But I know several really smart people who love punk, metal, blues, reggae, or folk more than classical.  So I wouldn't say it's a 100% correlation. ",
