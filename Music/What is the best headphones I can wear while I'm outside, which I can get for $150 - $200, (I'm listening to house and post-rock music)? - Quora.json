            "answer_text": "Check out Senheiser HD-201 and HD-202, they are $20 headphones with amazing sound quality. Construction is a bit on the cheap side, but those are most bang for the buck earphones I have encountered. Do not expect strong basses, they are not Beats, but do expect amazing sound quality (better then Beats), and realistic sound.  You can get 9 pairs for $150. ",
