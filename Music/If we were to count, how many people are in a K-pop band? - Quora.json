            "answer_text": "Well, in my opinion, from what I saw in the music shows, ideal K-pop group should have odd number of members like : 3, 5, 7, 9, \u2026 why? With odd number of members like 4, 6, 8, \u2026., while choreographing or dancing, a person in center needs to exist for a perfect formation and transition while performing. Examples: Twice - 9 members - center here is Nayeon  BTS - 7 members - center here is Jungkook  Red velvet - 5 members - center here is Irene  I don\u2019t know, in my opinion, group with even numbers do not seem appealing to me in choreography while performing on stage, I keep feeling that there is a person missing on stage\u2026 (P.S: The examples I am giving are not bad examples, they are creative choreographs , I am just stating my opinion on the formation visually while performing the choreography) Example: Black Pink - 4 members  Even though you can make a person stand in the middle, but you need to make the other stand in the back with no clear formation but a diamond formation (picture bellow)  And I feel like the way they transition in the spots are limited because of the number of the members    That is pretty most of Black Pink choreography main spots as an example. Another thing I don\u2019t like is that, there is a blind spot for that one member if you want to be creative with the formation, so if that one member in the back has to appear, the members in the front line needs to bend a bit or lower down for the back to appear (The member in the back is Lisa - Not appearing clearly)  (The front line went down in the choreography and with camera centered - Now Lisa appears clear)  (I am sorry for the bad captures) I am saying all this, it is usually the singing member part comes in the center, or at least in a spot that indicates the light spot of the member singing. And with choreography and transitions they have to show that. Update: Another example for an odd number is 6 right? 4 members while choreography definitely has a weak spot, however with 6 member group things can get more creative. Ex: G-Friend - 6 members (The photo bellow is taken from the video dance practice of Memoria)  As usual, a member is in the back for the formation and transition, their bonus is their choreography is really is fresh and innovative (The photo bellow was taken form the dance practice video of Me Gustas Tu)  I also watched Love Whisper as someone suggested And I counted in their video when that one member was in a blind spot I reached 10 times (It was more) And I watched some other couple of their choreography videos, I still feel like with a person at the center it is more organized and appealing to viewers. And I watched their latest comeback stage \u2018Fever\u2019 It was different, unique, and new to see on G-Friend However the things I mentioned regarding the center and someone in the back as a blind spot for the main spot is still there. I am not saying they are with a lot of flaws, the question just mentioned ideal number of members and that is it\u2026 Hope that was clear enough! If I thought something was unclear or missing I will update! :D ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, the ideal number of members in a group are from 3\u20139. I will break down my opinion and find the most ideal number from these options using these three categories: Formations for choreographyLearning members names (the best number for it to not be confusing)Each of the members\u2019 parts in the song (line distribution)Choreography For choreo, I find that odd numbers are the best way to go. 3, 5, 7 or 9 would all be perfect for choreo, simply for the fact that they can do various formation types without leaving anyone in the back. Any even numbered formations, and you risk having someone in the back, especially for 6 membered groups. Learning names Ok, you need to learn at least stage names when you start to become a fan of a group, but sometimes there are a ton of members. For me, any group above 6 members and I get confused. I could barely keep up with BTS when I first started learning their names, and then there was TWICE, and then Seventeen, and then EXO, and then NCT, etc. But for groups such as GFriend, MAMAMOO, EXID, BLACKPINK, Red Velvet, 3Racha (technically a sub-unit, but ok), NCT Dream (also a sub-unit), etc., since there are less members, there are less faces to match and less names to learn. Parts in a song For me, 4 or 5 have got to be the best numbers. I\u2019ve written an answer for What's your opinion on Kpop groups with fair/unfair line distribution?, and I briefly mentioned the dynamic of the song, but I will mention it again: First verse, second verse, pre-chorus, chorus, third verse, pre-chorus (or just right ahead to the chorus), bridge and finally, the dance break. If you had a 4 member group, you could split this very easily. It could also work for a 5 member group, in my opinion. In conclusion, 5 people is the most ideal number of members in a group because of 3 reasons: The formation in choreo will ALWAYS be ideal and no one will be left in the back, you would only need to learn 5 names and that\u2019s not a lot, and finally, the line distribution should be fairly equal, based on the song dynamic that I\u2019ve shown above. <3 ",
