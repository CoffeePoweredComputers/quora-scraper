            "answer_text": "They\u2019re upset because his solo lines in \u2018Make It Right\u2019 got cut out to make room for Lauv\u2019s feature. Honestly, I think it\u2019s a dumb thing to be upset about. Jungkook had the same thing happen but for both of them, you can hear them in the chorus and doing the harmonies. The collab is probably never going to be sung live, and if it was, BigHit will, of course, make sure both of them get to sing. It\u2019s also not being promoted or released around the same time as their actual comeback. This was just a chance for BTS to have some fun with another artist they admire. BTS has a huge influence on their own music and collabs; if Taehyung really found it such a problem then I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve changed it. I\u2019m actually a bit pissed off at this whole discussion and how ARMY is blowing it out of proportion. Also because all these fans that are so pressed about Taehyung not having any lines don\u2019t give a crap that Jungkook doesn\u2019t have any solo lines either. Like, fine, be annoyed about it but then be annoyed for all of them, not just your faves! Let\u2019s just support the song :) \u2014Sani ",
