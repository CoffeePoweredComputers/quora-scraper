            "answer_text": "You might be interested in a recent study published byAnneli B. Haake in academic journal Musicae Scientiae - http://msx.sagepub.com/content/15/1/107.full.pdf+html  that looked at how music listening affected office workers in the UK.   The abstract and introduction give a great insight to what we've learned about how music affects human performance over the last century. Clearly listening to music affects human beings but subsequent performance is more related to how that music makes you feel rather than any direct impact on your IQ or learning ability.  Another factor that comes out of the study is that this benefit is directly related to how much control you have over the auditory environment - one man's meat is another man's poison - so while Classical music might work for some, others perform just as well with a little \"Talk Dirty To Me\" playing in their ears! I personally believe that there is a benefit to not listening to music with words when you are performing language based tasks - I find it hard to create new words or stories when I'm being distracted by someone else's.  This may be where the recommendation of classical music for people who wish to study comes from, but I suspect it has more to do with (now diminishing) historical socio-economic bias in music listening tastes.

            "answer_text": "Not for me, but then I\u2019m a musician who has a tendency to picture the score of something I\u2019m listening to, kind of like that famous scene in Beautiful Mind where Russell Crowe has all those mathematical calculations swirling around his eyes. I\u2019m not that bad (or brilliant); I\u2019m just very relaxed as I listen and say, \u201cOh, that flute line looks like that and those violins that just entered would be written like that\u201d so you can see how this habit would seriously disrupt study. For the record I\u2019m real good at music notation. Music affects different brains in different ways. Some people can put on Mozart and study and the music actually helps their minds absorb what they\u2019re reading like a sponge. You can often see them in the university library with their headphones on listening while they study. I don\u2019t know how they do it. For others it\u2019s not like they\u2019re actually listening intently to whatever is playing but they still end up flunking the exam and wondering why. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have been the music; I wasn\u2019t even listening to it, really.\u201d Yes you were, you just didn\u2019t realize your subconscious was tuned in preventing you from consciously absorbing whatever you were reading. These kinds of people should stay away from listening to music while they\u2019re studying if they don\u2019t want to lose their scholarship and end up paying off a 100K student loan. I think it\u2019s similar to these ambidextrous people who can spin their pens on the top of their hands in a circle, ever see them do that?  I have tried and tried for years to learn that, even paid someone $100/hr to try to teach me and they nearly sued for almost putting their eye out when the pen went flying toward their face. I\u2019m still fascinated when I see students doing this and I turn green with envy like a little 4-YO who wants his neighbor\u2019s tricycle and can\u2019t have it. Anyway I digressed. If you can listen to music and ace a test and learn the music at the same time you\u2019re one of these geniuses who can use both halves of their brain at the same time. I\u2019d think you\u2019re in extreme danger of losing it to science if you\u2019re ever taken into the ER and one of the Dr\u2019s recognizes you and says, \u201cI know this guy. He can listen to Mahler\u2019s Third Symphony, get 100% on his advanced chemistry exam and remember the entire symphony afterward.\u201d I\u2019d be very afraid his partner might say, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t we code him and sell his brain to the mad scientist down the block?\u201d Next thing you know you\u2019re walking around in a green body with battery terminals in your neck.
