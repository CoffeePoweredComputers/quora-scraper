            "answer_text": "I am not really a superstitious person. I know how people think no. 13 is unlucky, and how Winston Churchill never went out of his house on the 13th day of his month. But I don't really think there's a connection between luck and just a number. When you do good, people call it good luck, when you don't, it's called bad luck. As for different albums.. Yea i have seen many albums with 13 songs, but I really think it's just the number of songs an artist wants to put on his/her album. I have seen albums with 13 songs fail, and I have seen albums with 13 tracks succeed. For example: Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid MAAD Cidty did great, and got an Oscar, whereas Porter Robinson's Worlds had mixed reviews and was full of filler tracks in the middle. Both have 13 tracks. Another example:London Grammar's If You Wait was an awesome 10 track album.They put out 3 more bonus tracks and made it 13. Those three tracks were not that good and felt too much. Numbers don't really matter, what matters is how much work you have put into your work of art, and how the album works together. Songs individually might be great, but if they don't work together as a compilation, there is no merit to that. ",
