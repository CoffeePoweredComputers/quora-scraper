            "answer_text": "There are several characteristics, but they\u2019re not agreed upon. Here\u2019s my list in order of importance; The scale. Folk music has a different scale than the piano keyboard. It\u2019s been called the \u201cfolk music scale\u201d and the \u201cgapped scale.\u201d They have also thought folk music is pentatonic or hexatonic. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s based on the natural scale (also called the harmonic series or the overtone series). So the music\u2019s designed on herding instruments that use that scale. That scale does not have octave-equivalence. look for the natural scale by ignoring unaccented beats and only look at the stressed beats.It\u2019s rarely composed. Folk music is passed on aurally, not by pen and paper. It often bears the mark of \u201coral-formulaic composition.\u201dOnly old people compose a song which is rare. It\u2019s not done by sitting down and writing it, but is done by thinking and moving the body (not by sound but by movement \u2013 trying to create a magic spell).It is not improvised. Most people don\u2019t know this. The performers are trying to do it exactly as they heard it the first time. They fail. Ethnomusicologists then ask why they did it differently and the performers lie and pretend they meant to do it that way (an embellishment).Older songs are syllabic. Many people would disagree on this, but if you look at it long enough, neumic or melismatic elements are modern aberrations.The folk music revival of the 1950s is a sham. They took folk music and set the songs to modern harmony and played on guitars. Few rural people in the 1950s played guitar. Although Indo-European in origin, it is not a common folk instrument.",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm, different for different cultures. Basically, it is a form or tradition which has been handed down over generations orally. However, this itself is not so easy to conform to as some things which aren't \u201cfolk\" might also be handed down. Some people consider it \u201cnot for profit\" but musicians have always liked being paid. Whether it is basically a commercial form or not. I'd suggest that it's base is acoustic instruments, rather than electric (obviously many folkies are electric now). Songs and themes often about everyday life and/or historic events. Singing is often unaccompanied. Regional forms. The problem is that several \u201cnon-folk\" styles, like Bluegrass, Blues, Country etc meet some of these criteria. For every \u201crule\" there is an exception. ",
