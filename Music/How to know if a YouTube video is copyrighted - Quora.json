            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s in video form and not just in somebody\u2019s head, it\u2019s copyrighted unless the person who created it specifically released it into the public domain. You should always assume that ANY video or creative work you find online anywhere (not just on YouTube) is copyrighted. After all, if you didn\u2019t produce it yourself, then somebody else did, and unless that person specifically released it into the public domain or makes clear that it is not copyrighted, then it\u2019s only safe to assume that it is until and unless you can confirm otherwise. It used to be a requirement that the owner register the copyright or include specific copyright notations (like the words \u201cCopyright\u201d or the symbol \u00a9), but those are no longer required, and the entire history of YouTube has come about since long after that changed. In fact, any work produced after 1976 automatically bears a copyright the moment it was \u201cfixed in tangible form\u201d (i.e., no longer in somebody\u2019s head but recorded in some way so as to be perceptible or recognizable).[1] A video posted online certainly counts as a tangible medium of expression. If you want to use someone else\u2019s video, contact them to request their permission. One major advantage with YouTube is that it is such a large and supportive community, and often people post their works there because they want to share them with others. So the chances are often good that if you ask, the producer may be willing to grant permission (assuming it\u2019s actually their work*). *Lots of material on YouTube wasn\u2019t uploaded legally, or it may include content that the original producer had permission to include but you wouldn\u2019t, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to ask. NOTE: While I have stated and referenced the principles and definitions as they are articulated in the United States\u2019 copyright law, the Berne Convention makes them applicable in all 170+ countries which are signatories.[2] However, since YouTube is based in the U.S., its laws apply.

            "answer_text": "It is pretty easy to tell if a video is not protected by copyright. It will be a silent film in black and white. Copyrights last a LONG time. For works created before the newer standard of Life + 50 years (Life + 70 in some countries, like the U.S.) the standard was 95 years. \u201cTalkies\u201d were introduced in 1927 (The Jazz Singer - Wikipedia). Sure, technically a movie made in the U.S. before 1977 needed to have its copyright registered and then renewed. The instances of a production company failing this are small enough to count on two hands. (How a Copyright Mistake Created the Modern Zombie - Plagiarism Today) So really, for practical purposes your question just isn\u2019t meaningful. Essentially all of the content on YouTube is protected by copyright. Because copyright is an automatic process these days, lasting for generations. ",
