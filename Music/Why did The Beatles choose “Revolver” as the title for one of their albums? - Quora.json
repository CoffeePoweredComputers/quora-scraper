            "answer_text": "The title of this album should have been \u201cAbracadabra\u201d.  That was the name the Beatles preferred as the title of their new 1966 album. But they discovered that another band had already used it so they had no choice but to think up of another title. When discussing possible alternatives during their German tour, Paul McCartney suggested Magic Circle. In response to that, John Lennon came up with Four Sides to the Circle. While Ringo Starr jokingly suggested After Geography, play on the title of the Rolling Stones\u2019 recently released album with the title Aftermath. Other suggestions included Bubble and Squeak, Beatles on Safari, Freewheelin\u2019 Beatles and Pendulum before they settled on Revolver. The Beatles confirmed their choice, which was Revolver, in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on July 2, 1966. So what was \u201cREVOLVER\u201d? Just like Rubber Soul, it was a pun. And like we know, a pun is a play on words, a joke exploiting the different possible meanings of a word. And what are the different possible meanings of it? Well, it referred to both a kind of handgun and the \u201crevolving\u201d motion of a record as it plays on a turntable. And it could also mean that the focus of Revolver appears to rotate from one Beatle to another with each song. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a pun on the revolving drum and horn inside a Leslie tone cabinet which was used to record Lennon\u2019s vocals on \u201cTomorrow Never Knows.\u201d Lennon originally expressed a desire to be suspended in a harness and swung in a circle around a central stationary microphone. He wanted a swirly, whooshy feel to the vocal, a kind of \u201cechoing down windy canyons\u201d effect. The engineers said, \u201cUh, no.\u201d The insurance bean counters said, \u201cHell, no!\u201d So Geoff Emerick, genius engineer for Abbey Road, started thinking about rotating sound sources\u2014and realized that the Leslie was the perfect answer. When they started taking apart the circuitry, they weren\u2019t at all sure that it would work, though. Would there be distortion? Voltage/impedance mismatches that would result in a loud hum impossible to remove from the signal? Would the vocal even be usable in a final mix? Mark Lewisohn, in his brilliant examination of the techniques and devices used by the Beatles, The Abbey Road Sessions, tells us that the results were astonishing. It sounded wonderful, so good in fact that when the lads heard the playback, they all wanted to try it on various tunes for the album. (\u201cYellow Submarine\u201d was mentioned as a possible candidate.) But good taste and George Martin prevailed. A new technique rapidly becomes boring if it\u2019s overused. Nevertheless, from that point on, the Leslie tone cabinet became a valuable tool no longer restricted to the Hammond organ. It\u2019s been used for piano, vocals. synthesizers, and especially guitar. (George\u2019s searing, soulful solo on \u201cLet it Be\u201d was run through a Leslie at high speed (the \u201cchorale\u201d setting) to get that shimmery gloss) Today, every guitar pedal manufacturer offers an emulator pedal that simulates the Leslie sound\u2014including the Leslie/Hammond Company. (It\u2019s an expensive gadget, about $400, but it was designed and built by the people who actually build Leslies and in my humble opinion, sounds the best of all of them) Emerick also invented Automatic Double Tracking (ADT) because John hated having to sing the same vocal twice, exactly as he had sung the first. He didn\u2019t like to repeat himself either, so Emerick fiddled around with a primitive delay design that split the vocal signal into two inline signals, one normal, one at about 50-100 milliseconds after the first. Presto! Automatic Double Tracking and John and the lads no longer had to mess about at three in the morning, trying to recreate exactly their first take. The result was an extremely fat vocal signal with lots of dynamic range and sustain that could be controlled with tube-powered compressors and limiters. (They were primitive in those days!) Admittedly, the pun is a little obscure and the surviving Beatles aren\u2019t particularly forthcoming on precisely why they decided to name the album Revolver. When Lennon and Harrison were still with us, it was a kind of silent agreement among the four to let the public decide for itself what the titles, the lyrics, the music, the entire content of each of their magnificent albums really meant. But I remember a rather illustrative scene from the documentary, \u201cThe Birth of the Beatles,\u201d where Lennon spoke to a bearded, ravenous hippie who had somehow managed to track him down at George\u2019s estate to tell him his interpretation of \u201cI Am the Walrus.\u201d Lennon\u2019s response before inviting him in to feed the poor starving bastard? \u201cIt\u2019s just a song, man. It\u2019s just a song!\u201d ",
