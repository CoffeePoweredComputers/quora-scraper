            "answer_text": " The audience arriving at James W. Hilton Coliseum in Ames, IA - May, 28, 1976 Despite suffocating his own recording career by focusing on easy listening ballads while people wanted hard rock, he was still the hottest ticket in live performing. No solo artist was bigger than Elvis, which makes it all the more tragic that he never lived long enough to finally stage the world tour he dreamed of. He still had what it took to bring out crowds of all ages.  Elvis arrives in Greensboro, NC on June 30, 1976. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes he was. He was large draw in concert (no that's not a joke about his weight), and he did continue to have hit songs, though mostly on the country charts. But after his hugely successful Satellite Special in 1973, his star had dimmed a bit. Times were changing and older, more established stars weren't looked upon with the same amount of respect. Elvis himself really didn't seem to be enjoying himself anymore. He had become what he had once rebelled against. ",
