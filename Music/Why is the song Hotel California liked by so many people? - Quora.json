            "answer_text": "If I started listing down the reasons why I love the song, \"California\" as a town would not even appear in the 100th place. The song has got little to do with the city itself. Rather, they talk about a hotel which is simply named as \"Hotel California\".  So why are people crazy about the song?  Unique, thought provoking lyrics. It's not your typical \"love you love me hate me\" song. Soothing music; especially in the live version featured in the album \"Hell Freezes Over\". Excellent introductory guitar solo. In fact, all the guitar solos in the song are awesome. The easy listening flow of the song. It's a long song, but you never feel bored while listening to it. Something intriguing is always coming up. There are many more reasons, but these are the ones that came to me right away. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Hotel California is an extremely well-composed epic. It is considered a timeless classic rock tune for a number of reasons, and some of them that I can think of include: Its highly recognisable guitar intro, which is a common feature found in pretty much majority of all rock classicsGreat lyrics that are non-cliched and open to your own interpretation in natureFantastic lead vocals by Don Henley, who sang with a great balance of urgency and \u2018laid back\u2019-ness at the same timeAmazing outro guitar solo played by both Joe Walsh and Don Felder, which is also one of the greatest lead guitar moments in music history",
