            "answer_text": "Michael Jackson was not all that of a punch bag for everyone. All the Jackson's said that Michael was the only one that fought back his father when he was beating them or him. In later years, Michael became a gentle soul , shy, soft spoken and barely vocal because most likely Michael became more spiritual. In Michael Jackson's early twenties and in his thirties, he couldn't control jealousy much when it came to his girlfriend. He would throw and break things. He got out of control with jealousy just like any normal bloke. Not liking his girlfriend to dance three sets with any man even a male friend. Once Chris Tucker was dancing with his girlfriend and after two sets, Michael got mad and snatched her away from Chris. In 1986, Michael destroyed a brand new car with a baseball bat when his girlfriend told him that she no longer loved him. She didn't mean it. He had cheated and she found out. The damage was done. The car was unrepairable. There are several hotels that Michael Jackson was thrown out off for breaking up the entire room. One in Barbados , one in Caracas, Venezuela, and Michael broke up a house in Las Vegas unnecessarily when he thought his girlfriend had left him again in 2008. You can Google it. \u201c Michael Jackson owes landlord for destroying property in Las Vegas. Did Michael shout? Yes, and when he did, it was not the sweet voice but a scary, terrifying voice. Did Michael yell regularly, NO! Michael tried not to shout at anyone but there were times it became necessary. There is a YouTube video of Michael being very much in command verbally to one girl who was practising the walk for ' The Way You Make Me Feel.' You can hear him telling her to work the stage. I never heard Michael Jackson curse and say the F word. Maybe he respected me, to not curse in my presence. I have cursed around him out of anger. Michael would say, it's not becoming of you to curse! I would say, you pissed me off enough to make me curse. Michael Jackson would say because I never heard you do it before, don't again! If, Michael Jackson cursed to Lisa Marie Presley ,then he had no respect for her as a woman. I know Lisa Marie Presley curse like it's part of her vocabulary. Maybe her swearing rubbed off on him. I don't know what happened with her claiming he cursed, because he never did around me as I said. Michael was also a Jehovah Witness brought up in this religion. Cursing was considered a grave sin! I believe Lisa Marie Presley lied that Michael use to curse in front of her. Or it could be she just wanted to say he was a regular guy that did regular things, like curse\u2026it could have been a slip of the tongue. I have seen the very best in Michael Jackson but I have also seen the worst with his jealousy. Throwing vases, lampshades, plates, chairs, anything he could get his hands on. Never at anyone just at walls to get rid of rage! Michael Jackson was a lover, not a fighter! Michael Jackson was a giver not a taker! My daughter gave Michael Jackson a gift once and he cried. He cried because people always wanted from him. No one ever gave to him! The gesture of giving him a gift who had everything , and she was a young girl touched him deeply. Michael Jackson is true to himself! True to others, black ,white, Chinese, Indian it didn't matter to him about race! Michael loved and cared for all. He was way beyond his time. Maybe mankind will get there some time! Michael Jackson lived for the love and gratification of God. Hence why he could not have hurt any child! He was a victim of fraud that was sanctioned by white justice on a black man. Michael Jackson said that he learnt not to trust but he didn\u2019t have the personality and spirit to live a life being forever suspicious. It took too much energy, and hence why the Arvizos caught him off guard! He had love for the dying child Garvin. But Garvin's greedy mother had no love for her son, only desire for riches that was gained wrongfully. Mrs. Arvizo suffered from illusions of grandeur after an underprivileged existence. Michael Jackson is from a higher realm. One filled with love not hate! An angel from heaven! Angels from heaven get mad, they get angry when they witness the evil souls of man. The length they will go for material gain. The killings, lying, exploits , conniving, dangerous traits of mankind. Michael is one angel that gets angry and have burst of temper at times. ",

            "answer_text": "In his youth never. He was very peaceful. He was not confrontational. Jennifer Batten said that she never heard him raise his voice on anyone. He didn\u2019t use bad words either. He didn\u2019t swear in his youth. Frank Cascio wrote in his book my friend Michael that Michael could not stand it when Lisa Marie was shouting and he would ironically applaud her after she was done shouting. All that changed of course after the 93 scandal. He was very angry and he expressed his anger in his songs like Scream. He was very angry during the 2005 trial. He told a reporter \u2018\u2019F\u2026k you\u2019\u2019. He said that to many reporters, one of whom was Aphrodite Jones, who though his detractor at first she started defended him when she looked into the case and realized the Arvizos were lying. On another occasion, he said about an attorney \u2018\u2019 tell her to go to hell\u2019\u2019, that was after the baby dangling incident in Berlin in 2002 and he was asked about an attorney who wanted to start an investigation on him to determine whether he was a fit parent or not. In the book remember the time his bodyguards narrate an incident in which Michael threw his bodyguard\u2019s mobile phone over the window and another one during which he broke a paparazzi\u2019s camera and had to pay 75000 dollars for it.

            "answer_text": "Michael Jackson got angry like anybody else. It was just the way he would display his anger. When he was much younger, Michael would indirectly get back at someone who wronged him. Some people will get in your face and tell you off if you make them mad, not so with Michael, he'd piss you off behind the scenes, and that continued as he got older, only he became more vocal about it. As his former bodyguards, Bill Whitfield, and Javon Beard know, Michael could really get mad. He once threw and busted Bill's phone, yelling that he wanted to be left alone,( Michael meant by the Tabloids). Then told Bill,\" I guess you'll have to buy a new phone.\" I also got a little taste of how it was when you were not on time with him. I once missed a call from him because I was getting an exam at the doctors office, and he didn't like the fact that he couldn't reach me at that time. When he did get me he said,\" I pay you to be available at all times.\" His voice was a little raised, and he wasn't smiling. Michael would curse now and then when he was talking about people that he didn't like, or when he needed something and couldn't get it right then. Of course this was not the side of him that he wanted the public to see. I mean, I could understand that, I don't want people seeing me when I have bad days either. Most times when Michael was angry, he vented in private. ",

A reporter pushed a fan on the ground to get a picture of Michael and was really getting on his nerves. Than Michael started yelling to this guy and said \"Fuck you\":  His sister Janet was also pretty angry and so seemed his mother. Anyway, with all what was going on, I understand him perfectly well. And of course, as a human, he would get angry at other moments, but I think, in no way was he dangerous when he did that. It's just like anybody who would get angry. I very rarely do that as well and most of the time, I manage not to show it, there are times when I can't help it and still, I react as easy as I can, with some sarcasm and a higher tone, but not yelling and breaking things around. Some day I may do it if I go on like this, who knows... Anyway, that's something pretty human, we all have it and he had it as well. ",

She said he would scream and yell and throw things. What I\u2019ve gotten from all accounts of Michael being angry is that he was violent at times. Paris said Michael swore like a sailor all the time, so I\u2019m guessing he had no trouble with throwing something out there. ",
