            "answer_text": "I think Elvis\u2019 health started to decline in the mid to late 1960\u2019s if I remember correctly. Unlike some other stories you might have read Elvis actually started taking amphetamines while in the army. Not earlier. Elvis did not do illegal drugs or drink alcohol (or not much). The army supplied them, not yet realizing how bad for most people they can become. So the drug would wake you up and keep you awake for hours past the time when you should be getting sleep. This is hard on your heart. When Elvis got home he would need sleeping pills to help him sleep after using the amphetamines. He went for a few years just taking these which would not be healthy. Then I think he had teeth repaired and was given codeine pain killers. The ill effects of these pain killers was not yet fully realized at the time by the medical community. As Elvis would do with most things in his life he took his prescribed drugs to excess. I think he was also prescribed other types of prescription pain killers as time went on as the codiene only goes so far before you\u2019re really taking too much. In the late \u201860\u2019s or early \u201870\u2019s he was diagnosed with a twisted colon. Again, more prescription meds. Then all the touring in the \u201870\u2019s\u2026.more prescription drugs to keep him going. A poor to bad diet also didn\u2019t help his health. So Elvis\u2019 poor and declining health was a slow progression toward his death. Excluding his diet, his health issues would\u2019ve started in the army even though that wouldn\u2019t have been recognized for a few years. ",
