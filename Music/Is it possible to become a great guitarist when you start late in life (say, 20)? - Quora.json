            "answer_text": "Oh, yes, of course. I have a similar story like yours and I'll tell you how I did it and what steps you should take. Okay, by no means I'm a great guitarist, but I do have a good grip on chords, fingerstyle and I'm also a part of my college band and played at a club sometimes. I started off when I was 18, it took me around an year to get the hang of everything. Here's what I'll suggest you :- Take classes for a month, and learn how to hold the guitar and other basics. Learn more than what your teacher teaches you everyday, by using the resources online.Quit the classes and continue on YouTube through JustinGuitar channel, this guy have put in a lot of work and also has a beginner series which teaches you guitar from scratch.After you have reached to an amateur level, you can re-join classes and take your music even further.Practise, practise and practise. Sometimes you want to give up the guitar, you'll hate the guitar. But if you stick with it, you're gonna be rewarded. - Jimi Hendrix  You can view my work at- [1] My YouTube channel.

            "answer_text": "Have you ever heard Wes Montgomery play guitar? Wes had a unique picking style, where he used his thumb and his fingers at the same time, which gave Wes a really interesting \u2018chord\u2019 style of playing, rather than one just note at a time. As Wes got better, other musicians started hearing about Wes\u2019 unique guitar style and began to ask Wes to play with them. Here are just some of the giants of jazz with whom Wes played with during his career: Jimmy Smith (organ): Lionel Hampton (vibes); Cannonball Adderley (orchestra); John Coltrane (quintet); Freddie Hubbard (trumpet); Milt Jackson (vibes); Herbie Hancock (piano); Ron Carter (bass); Grady Tate (drums); Ray Barretto (percussion); and Hubert Laws (flute). Wes is gone now, but while he was with us, he did just fine as a guitarist. Oh, I almost forgot. Wes didn\u2019t start playing guitar until he was 20 years old. ",
