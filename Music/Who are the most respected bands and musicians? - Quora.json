            "answer_text": "Frank Sinatra   Frank was hugely respected amongst his peers for his amazing voice which in it's prime was a thing of incredible beauty. Nobody could sing quite like Frank. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Frank didn't just stand behind the mike and sing what he was told to when ordered. He was a band leader who took control over his own musical career. The public loved and respected him for his longevity and huge success. So many songs that are instantly recognisable as standards are best known for Frank's versions (My Way, New York New York, Come Fly with me etc). He's reported to have sold more than 150 million albums in his career. Frank also gained further respect for his film career. Unlike a lot of other singers who went into movies, Frank could really act. He earned acclaim for lots of his roles and was nominated for an oscar twice and won once. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd have to say Dave Grohl. Not only was he a member of Nirvana --one of the biggest rock bands of all time--, through Foo Fighters, he also proved he could write great songs such as \u201cEverlong\u201d. He\u2019s worked with dozens of bands on many albums helping keep the rock n roll ecosystem alive and well. For example, he was responsible for the drum work on Queens of the Stoned Age, Tenacious D and Them Crooked Vultures. He's earned the respect of other mega bands such as Led Zepplin and Metallica. Even Prince gave him a nod at the Super Bowl halftime show by covering one of his songs. Prince Shocked Foo With \u201cBest Of You\u201d A few years ago, he again reinvented himself as a film maker and made the spectacular Sound City. The guy is just cool. ",
