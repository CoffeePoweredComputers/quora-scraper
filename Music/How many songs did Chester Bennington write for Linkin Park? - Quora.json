            "answer_text": "Well.. tracking down the EXACT number of songs Chester personally wrote is difficult to pinpoint, to say the least. I know that Chester did write the song \u201cThe Messenger\u201d on the album A Thousand Suns. He wrote that song for his kids, he said (maybe not the exact phrasing, but close), \u201cthe lyrics just came to me after hearing the opening cords. That is rare for me\u201d. I also know that the mass majority of Linkin Park songs were something that the entire band collaborated together on as a whole. Like a piece of them is in each song. If one member thought something didn't sound right they would change it until it did and they all agreed. Teamwork. So really there are a ton of Linkin Park songs out there that Chester co-wrote with Linkin Park. If you really want to dive in to Linkin Park stuff you can check out LinkinPedia.com or Genius | Song Lyrics & Knowledge . Both sites have legit info on Linkin Park. The LinkinPedia.com site is where you will find a crap load of information on Linkin Park and what song is on what albumb when it was released, where they toured, song line ups for concerts, ect.. Also you can find info about who worked on what song on every album. Which is 99.9% of the time all of the members of Linkin Park. Genius has info on what a song is about. How they came up with the lyrics for a song and all that kind of stuff. Plus you can find things that Chester personally wrote about some songs on that site too. ",

            "answer_text": "To be presice, he wrote almost all the song of lp with of course Mike Shinoda , if you think that he has just written some dead by sunrise song and many other project song than you are wrong, lp songs are easily be seen as someone suffering and writing the song, which is Chester Bennington.
