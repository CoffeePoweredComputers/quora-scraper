            "answer_text": "OP: Is Dancing Queen a gay song? Do you mean to ask is the song about a gay man? You are free to interpret a song any way you like, and some artists do not mind. However, this song is about a 17-year-old girl In Dancing Queen\u2019s case, these images told the story of a 17-year-old girl on a nightclub dancefloor \u2013 lost in the music and the moment. The sonic euphoria mirrors the freedom that the dancefloor can bring, although, as with all Abba songs, there\u2019s a hint of what Ulvaeus called \u201cthat Nordic melancholic feeling\u201d to it. The teenage girl isn\u2019t the narrator, after all, so is the listener really just an observer, looking back on their lost youth? Ultimately, the song seems less concerned with making you gaze forlornly back than it does with bringing the abandonment of your teenage years into the present, at least for four glorious minutes. Why Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen is the best pop song ever  Dancing Queen - Abba You can dance You can jive Having the time of your life See that girl Watch that scene Dig in the dancing queen Friday night and the lights are low Looking out for a place to go Where they play the right music Getting in the swing You come to look for a king Anybody could be that guy Night is young and the music's high With a bit of rock music Everything is fine You're in the mood for a dance And when you get the chance You are the dancing queen Young and sweet Only seventeen Dancing queen Feel the beat from the tambourine You can dance You can jive Having the time of your life See that girl Watch that scene Dig in the dancing queen You're a teaser, you turn 'em on Leave 'em burning and then you're gone Looking out for another Anyone will do You're in the mood for a dance And when you get the chance You are the dancing queen Young and sweet Only seventeen Dancing queen Feel the beat from the tambourine You can dance You can jive Having the time of your life See that girl Watch that scene Dig in the dancing queen Dig in the dancing queen ",

            "answer_text": "It has been adopted as one in various times and places. When I was young and disco wasn't yet quite dead, Dancing Queen was tremendously popular at certain gay clubs. I remember crowds actually roaring approval when the DJ put it on. Later, in the late 1990s, disco made a retro comeback in certain popular gay clubs. Resurrection, a weekly party at the Limelight in Manhattan, had a dedicated disco room at the top of the steps to the second floor. Dancing Queen could frequently be heard in that room, and to just as much approval, I think. That doesn't make it a gay song, but I can say that in my experience it was extremely popular among a subset of gay men for quite a long time. ",
