            "answer_text": "Before you can play your flute, you will need to learn how to assemble it. You can do so as follows: The flute has 3 parts. The top part is the head joint and has the mouthpiece or lip-plate. The part with most of the keys is called the Body at the top of the body (where the head joint goes into) is called the barrel or tenon, and the end is called the foot joint. When putting the parts together one must be very careful to not grab the rods and keys of the flute. This can bend the rods and keys and cause the flute to not be able to function properly. First put the foot joint on by holding the barrel of the flute. Hold end of the foot joint where you are not grabbing the keys and then do a twist and push motion and the foot joint should slide right on! Now align the rods of of the foot joint to the middle of the keys of the body Next is the head joint. Same thing, grab the barrel and the head joint (don't grab the mouthpiece! you can bend it!) Same motion, twist and push! Now align the bore (or the mouth hole) to be aligned with the first key of the body. !!! This is for beginners!!! The top of the flute is called the cap.Which holds and adjusts the cork. This adjusts the tuning of the flute. Do NOT keep twisting it and DO NOT take off and take cork out! If you feel the flute is out of tune ask a teacher or someone who works at an instrument store. For those who do not have a lesson teacher and would like to check if the cork is in the correct position take your cleaning rod and flip it around. The bottom of the rod should have a etched line, stick this into the head joint and look in the hole of the mouthpiece the etched line should be right in the middle. Learn how to blow into your flute. At first, producing a sound from your flute can be a little tricky, so you should practice the correct blowing method first, before you attempt to play any specific notes. BREATHING!! This is one of the most important aspects of playing the flute! Keep your shoulders relaxed and head up, breath from your stomach. By that, just imagine a string pulling from your belly button. Ladies especially young ladies. Your stomach is going to stick out, but this is the correct way to breath.Deep breaths not shallow!Don't just blow, one must have the correct embouchure to play correctly. Think of spitting out a sunflower seed! Try it! Try it again and freeze after you spit the seed out. That is how small the hole of your mouth needs to be while you blow. Now, say the word \"poo\" and freeze your face. This is the general facial position. Now add those 2 together and you now have the right embouchure to play.Now onto making a sound. Blow across the mouthpiece like blowing across a bottle. The sound is produced by the breaking of your air stream on the edge of the embouchure hole. Half your breath should travel above the hole, and half should travel down through the flute. Try to keep the corner of your lips firm but not tight!! You will know when they are too tight when you practice and the corners of your mouth is tired and sore. Remember to say \"poo\". This keeps your corner relaxed yet firm! ",

            "answer_text": "I'd recommend buying an $8 plastic Yamaha fife.  If your local music store doesn't carry this, they can order it. When it comes in -- they are really easy to carry around, and shorter (and lighter) than a concert flute.  I generally play a fife when I'm stuck in traffic, driving in Los Angeles, and steering with my knees if the traffic does open up slightly. But ... That's not a real answer to the question at hand.  Here goes: 1.  Take the head piece separately.  This is the part with the hole that you'd blow into.  Put the blowhole to your lips -- hold the head piece loosely in your right hand, and cover the tube's end (not the blowhole) with your left hand.  Then ... try and make a sound by blowing?  It's a bit like blowing on a glass jug.  You want the air to flow over the blowhole.  Try it with the tube's end covered and uncovered.  If you persist -- a new flute player can usually get a sound within a day or two of trying. 2.  Next ... try and assemble the flute.  The easiest notes to get are with all the holes covered, or the fifth above that, (with just the left-hand holes covered.)  Then ... blow?  This should be successful in less than a day. 3.  Keep at the tone, and try uncovering more of the holes.  If you don't read music -- certainly it's ok to just keep working on tone and improvising little melodies. 4.  Of course, you could also take lessons! 5.  Get a fingering chart, which tells you how the notes are fingered.  Get some very easy flute books -- maybe even some books written for recorder, and figure out equivalent notes on the flute.  My favorite recorder book is Musical Experience Through the Use of the Recorder.  It's got very famous melodies in there from the classical repertoire, arranged so you can pick the book up, and successfully play with next to no background.  It is, however, set up for learning recorder ... not flute.  I don't know a similar flute book -- sorry! 6.  Look at yourself in the mirror a little while playing.  This might just improve your posture, how you hold the flute, etc. 7.  Think of putting people to sleep with your playing -- This might help with tone. 8.  Go to some flute concerts, and ask for pointers. 9.  Join an orchestra, flute band, or something like that, to get practice playing with other people. That's it!!  It's really not that hard to get started -- Honestly, it's easier than it looks, to start.  REALLY!  I've given away about 10 Yamaha fifes, and most people were able to make a tone that day, some within 15 minutes.  You can do it! Note: I just gave away another one two days ago, to a neighbor who always wanted to play the flute.  It took him about 2 minutes to get a sound from just the head piece, and another 10 minutes or so to make a nice tone with all the finger-holes covered.  And I can hear him practicing in the morning ... ",
