It was definitely a must watch. Everything from music to scenes to dialogue all are perfect and you\u2019ll love Salman Khan more after watching it. Just watch it.       17.) DIL CHAHTA HAI :- Best movie to watch with friends. Awesome movie. Just watch it. Aamir Khan, Akshayee Khanna & Saif Ali Khan all have done the best work. Watch it.        18.) DRISHYAM :- The best suspense movie so far. It will definitely make your jaw drop. The climax is just unexpected like never in any film. It should be above in the list but NO the best parts are down in the context. If you\u2019ve not watched it till now just do watch it today only. Best suspense thriller movie of Bollywood.     19.) NIL BATTAYE SANNATA :- Education is important in the life of everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter whether a person is coming from an elite family or a poor one.

It is an awesome piece of work by Hrithik Roshan and the title track till now motivates and gives the patriotism feeling within.        EDIT 2:- Thanks for all the comments which you all gave for the betterment of the answer it was precious and important for me. There are more movies which the people commented should be added to the list to make it even better and they are as follows.  21.) MASAAN :- It is an adult movie which you shouldn\u2019t watch with your family but it is a must watch one. Really this list will remain incomplete without adding MASAAN to it and this point will remain incomplete without mentioning the beautiful song in the movie which keeps on going in the mind and it is :-\u2019Tu Kisi Rail Si Guzarti Hai\u2019 by Swanand Kirkire. The movie is emotional & romantic at the same time. Must watch I must say and you will thank me later.        22.) GULAAL :- The movie was totally amazing and engineering people should watch it and then they come to know what actual ragging is! This is what was happening in India before and this ragging now also happens in foreign countries too. After all the movie is a real patronist one if you\u2019re Indian and then if you\u2019re Rajput then this movie is for you. Kay Kay Menon has done fabulous acting like always and will definitely give goosebumps many times. Do watch it.     23.) ALIGARH :- In India being gay is not natural and that person should suffer in his whole life time this what Indian society wants unlike America where gay also gets respect and freedom just like others. Do watch this movie once it will tell you about the harsh reality of Indian society. No need to say Rajkumar Rao & Manoj Kumar both have done brilliant work in the film. Also this is the true story of \u2018Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras.\u2019 It will give to tears definitely and you\u2019ll going to think about the problem in our society after watching this awesome movie.      24.) SHAHID :- How a man alone can fight for freedom this movie tells us. And what the society does to it that also. \u2018Every Muslim is not a terrorist and Every Terrorist is not a Muslim\u2019 this we must understand and this is what Rajkumar Rao does in this movie. Awesome movie no doubt but it will also give you tears and happiness both.      25.) RAAZI :- This is a true amazing story on the book :-\u2019Calling Sehmat\u2019 Alia Bhatt has done best of her acting and definately gives tears to us and takes us to all the tendor conditions in the movie which we should experience to feel the film like we feel the novel. Songs are also amazing and the best one was:- \u2018Dilbaro\u2019 i guess.        26.) OMERTA:- Again a great movie by Rajkumar Rao. It tells a lot about the mentally of a terrorist and in that movie he acts as \u2018Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh\u2019 which was among-st the most wanted and most notorious , sharp and smart terrorist. Definitely watch this movie as it will give you goosebumps and also tells you more about the society like who is who. Must watch it.         27.) PADMAAVAT:- The movie which created the most controversies and got Supreme Court\u2019s Order to release. Do watch it as it was banned from few states from releasing and must watch that what was it that created so much controversy. Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Shahid Kapoor all have done brilliant performance and the movie is also amazing. A great work of Sanjay Leela Bhansali.        28.) SHIP OF THESEUS :- I have heard alot about it but I have not watched it till now. Do watch it definitely as many have recommended it as the best movie of Bollywood so far. And do tell about the movie and it\u2019s review in the comment section below. Should I watch it or not? Do tell and why should I watch it that also!         29.) GANGS OF WASSEYPUR:- No need to tell about the legendary of this movie. Both part 1 and part 2 both are tremendously awesome. I think I don\u2019t need to tell you that you shouldn\u2019t watch this movie with your parents. But I definitely tell to watch this movie again with your friends if possible.          30)KABIR SINGH:- This movie is debatable some liked it some don\u2019t. Some say it truely reveals about the true love of a person, some say that it\u2019s just self-destruction with vulgarity and male muscularity. Do decide yourself, I did liked the movie and hope you too.            EDIT 3:- Thanks for so many comments which suggest the movies I missed & also corrected me in my choice some do got offended too with my list but that\u2019s different case. Got some more suggestions:- 31) I Am Kalam- Legendary movie on legendary man. The former President of India. The story about the legendary scientist who over-come all the obstructions in his life & did many great work for the country. The Missile man of India Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.       32) My Name is Khan- one of the best work of sharukh khan. The movie has its serious essense by questioning the concept of hindu and muslim.The innocense and calm of the character in such a difficult situation i.e., fighting without violence. the emotions are expressed in an ideal though difficult to beleive. its dark scence are well compensated by beautiful love story that would definitely helped to change the temperament. He suffers from dyslexia & suffers bullying of muslim in US. Finally telling the Presudent of US his ultimate aim- \u201cSir, My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.\u201d       33) Mulk- One of the great movie to watch by late actor Rishi Kapoor & Taapsee Pannu. Tells alot about the suffering of muslims in India.    34) A Wednesday- If one loves thriller it us a must watch giving some of the best dialogues ever. One of the under-rated movie of bollywood. Naseerudin Shah & Anupan Kher both did tremendous job.      35) Badla- Since thriller is one of the main genre, if one loved Drishyam then Badla is a must watch. Kindly please don\u2019t spoil this beautiful movie & do watch the climax by yourself knowing the whole story. Kindly don\u2019t miss the beginning.      36) Devdas- Shahrukh Kha is an actor who can do justice to every character, just a big budget movie etc can be many reasons for denial but no doubt acting of Shahrukh showed his hardwork, his drunkness made people cry the side effects are just not said but showed whereas Ashwariya Rai smile is work watching even her patience & beleve that Deva i.e. Devdas will come-back to her. Not to tell but Maduri\u2019s dance & dialgues were also incompariable. Strong emotion and great or rather dramatic scenes does not let story behind. Some dialogues of the movie created history.          These were some of the best from my side do suggest in the comment box for even better list. Lastly I would like to thank all the 1K Upvoters so far who liked my answer. Literally it means alot. And 1Lakh 13K views. Really Thankyou. People say in their post not to do comment but I really want you people to comment any mistake or any major missing in my answer so that I can improve my content for good readability. Do comment for the betterment. Lastly thanks alot again. -Apoorv Upadhyay ",
