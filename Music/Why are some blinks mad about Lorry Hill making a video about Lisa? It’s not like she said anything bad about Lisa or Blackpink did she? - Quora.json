            "answer_text": "She said stuff about lisa having plastic surgery I think that\u2019s the main reason why. She said stuff like this: Plastic surgery is a neutral topic here, and I am all about lifting the stigma that it has in society. Love you all and enjoy! Lisa Manoban is the Magnae (Youngest) of Blackpink, she is also their Main dancer, lead rapper, and sub vocalist. Lisa, originally named Pranpriya Manoban was born on march 27, 1997, in Bangkok, Thailand. She is 5\u20196\u201d talls and she speaks Thai, Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese, making Lisa Manoban a Polyglot. At the age of 14, she auditioned and got into South Korea\u2019s YG entertainment, making a debut as a member of Blackpink in 2016.. She worked and trained as a Dancer and rapper for 5 years before she got the part.. Because of her Thai origin, Lisa is known by people as \u201cThai Princess\u201d. Let\u2019s get to her face: The first feature is her face with an adorable smile with cheeks puffing out around her lips, a trait that cannot be easily achieved with surgery, and is probably her best feature. Next is her eyes, full of expression and very hypnotizing. Lisa also has glowing skin, that appears to be silky smooth. Starting with her eyes, we can see some warping, often caused by having an epicanthoplasty,skin is removed from the inner eye corners, making the eyes appear more open. Next, the outer corners suggest a possible canthoplasty to round out the edges. She may also have gotten a lateral canthoplasty which gives a wider cat eye type look depending on how much you raise the eye. She could have gotten a blepharoplasty to remove some fat from the upper eyelid as indicated by less puffiness. Lisa Manoban nose is next. Her natural nose was wide and had a rounded tip. Her nose tip also sat lower before.. She has likely had a rhinoplasty as you can see by the before and after. I realized she may have had more than one rhinoplasty after looking at all the photos. The first made her nose smaller overall, more narrow, and brought in the nostrils. With her thick skin, she needed extra tweaking to get it correct over her new nose shape. A second rhinoplasty was likely done to raise the bridge and looks very much like a rhinoplasty with an implant or graft. In the US, surgeons use part of the body for a graft, and in asia it is more common to use a silicone implant. From the photos I have seen, it looks like it has been a struggle for her, and in many, her nose is misshapen or warped slightly. Surgeons probably had to work hard to get her nose as thin and symmetrical as it is today. This likely took many surgeries to perfect. My heart goes out to her for going through all that. Lisa Manoban teeth started short, small, and square, but now they are larger and rounded, she may have gotten some veneers done. As far as her body and skin, I don\u2019t believe she has had any skin bleaching, just that she chooses to stay out of the sun. The total list of Blackpink\u2019s Lisa Manoban possible procedures: Blepharoplasty, Epicanthoplasty, Lateral Canthoplasty, 3 rhinoplasties, lip lift, Medialized corner lip lift, Lip filler, Chin implant, Veneers, Buccal fat, Jawline filler. Prices are in the video. Some other reasons for any of these changes aside from surgery could be, Contour makeup, except she does use much makeup. Puberty, However some of these changes were well after puberty so that can\u2019t apply to changes such as her nose. Noses get larger, not smaller with age naturally. Weight loss/gain, could be the excuse for the cheeks, but that would not affect her eyes, lips, nose, and jaw. Regardless of procedures and changes, Lisa Manoban is talented, beautiful, and I hope that I can cover other Kpop stars like her in the future. Everything talked about in this video is MY OPINION ONLY and not actual medical facts about the individual represented here. Additionally none of this information is meant to shame the individual rather it's is for others to learn what they can do to enhance their appearance if they so choose. Please know that although I have a very informed opinion based on my own experience I am not an EXPERT or a Doctor. Please visit a plastic surgeon for medical advice.  One Reason why i\u2019m mad is because she said Lisa had plastic surgery I know its her opinion but I gotta disagree with her.YG Strictly forbids plastic surgery.She also said she isn't an Expert,so why is she even saying that if she is not 99% sure at least.Here is the video if you wanna check it out  I think that's one reason why some blinks are mad. EDIT:I have been getting some comments saying \u201cwhat's wrong with lisa getting plastic surgery?\u201d  She never really got plastic surgery and There is nothing wrong if she actually does it,but one reason why is because: Blank Pink, who appeared on Saturday's episode of SBS' \u201cParty People,\u201d a late-night talk show hosted by JYP Entertainment founder Park Jin-young, said YG artists are banned from alcohol and cigarettes, as well as driving, dating, plastic surgery and tattoos.They are banned from any plastic surgery during their time in YG..I hope this makes it clear and answers future questions about this. EDIT2:Lisa has changed ever since she became a member of blackpink.Once they debut they gotta dye their hair wear makeup\u2026And also she changed many of her daily habits since Then,so why cant looks change as well  If you can see in the picture her face is still the same.The only thing that's different it's that 1.Her hair is longer 2.She dyed it. 3.she is wearing makeup 4.Her outfit. I'm not saying all of this cause i'm just a blink I know that I would do this for everyone else not only lisa.  ",
