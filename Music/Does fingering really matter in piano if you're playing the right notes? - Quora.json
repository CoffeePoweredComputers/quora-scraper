            "answer_text": "Yes, it does. There are already a lot of good answers to this question. I\u2019ll start by confessing that I use a lot of lousy fingering, even though I\u2019m a fairly advanced adult player. And I would have been better off developing good habits as a child. There are couple of important things about fingering that really aren\u2019t obvious when you\u2019re a beginner, or even moderately advanced. So it really isn\u2019t clear why fingering is important until much later. (And honestly, I\u2019ve never heard teachers really explain *why* fingering is important in this way.) First, fingerings are about reliability. One important problem in advanced music is being able to play a passage correctly repeatedly. You obviously can\u2019t go into a performance with \u201cwell, I hope this hard passage is going to work out right.\u201d Simply knowing that you\u2019re going to finger it the same way every time is a huge help. But even beyond that, in complex passages there are frequently fingerings that aren\u2019t obvious; that are actually more \u201cdifficult\u201d than the obvious ones; but are more reliable. You\u2019re less likely to slip or miss. Second (and this may be a restatement of the first): Fingerings are less about the note you\u2019re playing now than the note you\u2019ll be playing next, or after that. Good fingerings set up what you\u2019re going to play in the future. And a little difficulty now might be a good down-payment for having your fingers in the right position a few notes later. This happens a LOT in Bach. You\u2019re often using an odd fingering now to make something possible 5 or 6 notes later. Third: fingering is important for legato and tone control. Some fingerings are easy but thumpy\u2014some finger (usually the thumb) is going to put an accent where you don\u2019t want it, and a good fingering will help to smooth things out. (Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as \u201cDon\u2019t play that note with the thumb!\u201d) Fingerings printed in books aren\u2019t absolute. Well, maybe in beginners\u2019 books\u2026 But I\u2019ve seen fingerings in advanced literature that just make no sense\u2014the Paderewski Chopin editions come to mind. My current teacher says that the fingerings in Henle\u2019s Beethoven editions work better for pianists with small hands. So you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to experiment, and find out what works for you. But fingering is not just a matter of playing the right notes\u2026 it\u2019s about playing the right notes reliably, and with the right dynamics. And I\u2019ll be the first to say that this is a \u201cdo as I say, not as as I do\u201d answer. I wish I had developed better habits as a beginner, but it\u2019s too late for that. Now I have to develop good habits as an adult, and that\u2019s a lot harder. ",

            "answer_text": "The highest reason why I believe fingering really does matter, beyond what has already been said, is muscle memory. Not only is it important to choose the most physically correct fingering, but it is important to commit to that fingering once it has been figured out. All physical activities rely upon muscle memory, and every time you play a song with new fingering, you are telling your brain, \"forget the pathway you were forging before! make this new one!!\" and pretty soon you are stuck with a whole lot of shallow pathways, instead of one epic path that you can always rely on. (I apologize if what I am saying is already abundantly obvious.) The best feeling is when my fingers know a piece so well, I can execute it effortlessly. Only when the fingers have been taught exactly where to be at exactly what moment, can a piece be effortless. If the fingering is inconsistent, even on a single note in the song, how can your fingers know what to expect? My teacher always said they must be rigorously trained, and not confused, like little puppies. ;) So yes, fingering matters, and good, simple consistent fingering matters a whole lot, from the most basic tunes up to the high heavens of musical accomplishment.
