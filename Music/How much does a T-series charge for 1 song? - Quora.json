            "answer_text": "Well that's mainly what productions are driven by! You know that marketing anything and anything has to have a specially added marginal cover price, well even amazon, I music, services always will have to be rendered for usage or the need to have for self, its the sharing that has to have boundaries. Examples, Apples movies choices, more try to get the newest quickest releases, also the varieties involved for downloads, cost,cost..what someone else may want but not necessarily needs, but just the love of being able to afford that cost. Series can be difficult in music mainstreams as well, but that's what music artist surely have to foresee, future versus past in music. Ehh! Artists world to make a challenge in marketing something new. Technology is advancing, so is makinds predictability to use it!! We see what is new or how come others like this or that, just why? So, affording goes to those that will pay the price, does not matter who it is or why it is wanted. Just wanting and using technology to find it!! Wow, enough said. ",
