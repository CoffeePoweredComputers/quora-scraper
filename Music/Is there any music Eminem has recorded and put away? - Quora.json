Em, has recorded a lot of songs that have never been released to the public, for Relapse, he recorded so many songs that he decided he was going to make a Relapse 2 so he could put the remaining songs on the second CD. He never did of course, he worked on Recovery and I assume through leaks and stuff of his \u201cKing Mathers\u201d - Relapse era songs that are on YouTube that he has plenty more recorded that he has never released.
