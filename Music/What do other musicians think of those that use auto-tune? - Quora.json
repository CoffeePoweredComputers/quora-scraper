            "answer_text": "Autotune is not necessarily the bane most people outside of the music industry assume it is. Wielded in the hands of a master, who applies it judiciously and appropriately, its effect will very likely never be noticed by the lay public. (Just like how, in movies, the very best CGI\u2026 never even gets noticed by the audience\u2026 that\u2019s how good, how deft, it is). Many excellent vocalists will occasionally sing a note slightly flat or sharp\u2026 in an otherwise perfect take. Autotune, precisely applied, will subtly nudge that note into a truer tune. No harm, no foul. Unfortunately, many music producers have used it: to attempt assiduously to correct the singing of people who can\u2019t even sing in the first place\u2014 the Jessica Simpsons of this world. Some \u201cthings\u201d in this world can\u2019t be \u201cpolished\u201d, if you follow my meaning.or use it as a patently obvious \u201cstyle\u201d, viz the famous \u201cBelieve\u201d record by Cher, and the so-called T-Pain Effect, with its \u201cstair-steppy\u201d effect. (To be fair, it was new when Cher did it, and it sounded fantastic then).I suppose the place I like it LEAST\u2026 would be in modern Country music. Entire vocal performances will today be rigorously (not delicately) autotuned, and very often entire stacks of harmony vocals will be synthesized/generated with the technology. That\u2019s right: Your favorite Country singer can sing a single line of music\u2026 then the producer can slap on 5 or 6 harmonies on top of him\u2026 which no person is singing, but rather are the result of digitally pitch-shifting the lead singer\u2019s vocal signal. (Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have told you this \u201csecret\u201d ?) This creates a bizarre, cold, metallic whiny sound, almost comb-filter-y, often devoid of a human\u2019s natural vibrato and tremolo, that, to me, is fundamentally antithetical to the (presumed) warmth and \u201cnaturalness\u201d that Country has always stood for. Autotune, set to \u201cstun\u201d, in Country music, gives me the same weird shudder as when I get some Juicy Fruit foil up against a silver tooth filling. It\u2019s gross to be in an otherwise cozy, warm Texas cafe\u2026 and suddenly hear that metallic, crispy, utterly synthetic whine coming over the speakers. (Fer Chrissakes, where\u2019s Patsy Cline when you need her?) Think of Autotune as a spice, like chilli pepper: a little bit added can be delicious\u2026 too much of it is awful and ruins the whole dish (recording). The miracle of digital audio now allows producers, artists and engineers to create some truly mindblowing effects, and Autotune is just another tool in their toolbox. But it\u2019s like a scalpel: in the hands of a surgeon, it works miracles; in the paws of a caveman it does grotesqueries. ",

            "answer_text": "Autotune. I hate the way that word has become a description that is so often used inappropriately! The world of audio recording is filled with effects that are produced either manually or electronically or digitally, to enhance the sound of an instrument or voice, and sometimes to save hours in the expensive and time-consuming process of recording, as well as to overcome the numerous problems that poor performance spaces can cause. Why, in an art form filled with artificial manipulation of sound, one tool should become the object of so much derision, criticism, and even outright hatred, is totally beyond my comprehension. The fact that tools exist to put things OFF pitch (chorus, flange, phase, vibrato, all do that in different ways) means that thankfully there are also tools to put things ON pitch. Before the existence of tools to do that, a vocal line with a single imperfect note would require either a full re-take, or a complicated \u201cdrop-in\u201d to correct one phrase, or some very clever editing to chop a perfect note with the right vowel sound from elsewhere and blend it in so hopefully no-one noticed. Now we have that tool, we can correct that note with a simple mouse movement in the digital domain, or even in analogue, a quick bounce across to a new track via the tool will do it. No more wasted hours, no more exhausted vocalist unable to reach that top note with spot-on pitch having to come back tomorrow for another go. Two hours of singing at full pelt is enough to make most vocalist get \u201ca bit pitchy\u201d. Vocal cords are a muscle, and a gruelling concert schedule, late nights, poor monitoring, rotten acoustics, and loud backline amplifiers can all make it impossible to hit pitch all the time. The fact that there\u2019s a tool to help out by gently pulling things into pitch is a blessing for audiences that like to hear the best possible performance. No-one complains about guitarists covering up their wrong\u2019uns with copious amounts of digital delay and/or overdrive. No-one worries about the drumkit actually triggering digital samples to save having another ten live mics on a small stage. No-one worries about the solo in the track being compiled from the best bits of about twenty different improvisations. Why the heck would anyone complain about digital tuning? It isn\u2019t always done automatically, it\u2019s a judicious manual process in the studio - and quicker than re-takes or edits. When it is done automatically, and with care, you can\u2019t hear it\u2019s there - but I see no reason to sneer at the performer when you find out it WAS there. Hurrah for technology that helps make music sound awesome. ",
