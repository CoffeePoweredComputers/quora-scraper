            "answer_text": "This isn\u2019t the worst heartbreak I\u2019ve ever experienced. It\u2019s not the most scarring, and looking back on it, it\u2019s even kind of funny. But I know I\u2019ll never forget it. She was my first love, and everything just felt different when I was 17. They say you never forget your first time. That\u2019s most likely true, in more ways than one. Michelle and I had been dating for a year and a half. She was my first girlfriend, and brought along with her an entire package of \u201cfirsts.\u201d My first make out session; my first sexual experience; my first dance with a date; my first snuggle buddy. We passed notes, kissed between classes and hung out on the weekends. If there is an \u201caverage American high school relationship,\u201d we were it. Michelle would come to my baseball games to cheer me on; I would buy her sandwiches for lunch. She would even drive me around in her red truck when I didn\u2019t feel like taking my car out. Everything was great, and as a kid in his junior year with zero responsibilities, life was good. Until things got weird. Michelle and I started to annoy each other. Her soccer games for me were no longer exciting, and she no longer laughed at my jokes. Things we had felt for over a year were no longer there. The inevitable came, and Michelle and I broke up. The night that it happened, I got drunk with my friends. Coors Light, a little bit of weed, and bitching about \u201chow dumb girls are\u201d were all I needed to smile again. I was sad, but in a happy way. I wasn\u2019t planning on dating anybody else before graduation, but I felt free. The end of the relationship wasn\u2019t where the heartbreak came. That was a few months later. Michelle and I had sex a few times after that. I knew at the time that it wasn\u2019t a good idea, but I was 17 and horny. My judgment wasn\u2019t the best. All in all, we were still on good terms. We still talked, we still hung out with the same people, and we still walked to classes together. People thought we were still dating, justifiably so. But we weren\u2019t; just \u201cfriends with benefits,\u201d if anything. Things were going good\u2026..until Michelle saw me talking with another girl a grade below us. I remember the look she gave me when she walked past after lunch. Pure hatred. That night she sent me a cryptic text message: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you sometimes.\u201d Let the games begin. My last semester of high school, I came across the following line in my Literature class: \u201cHell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\u201d I was about to find out how true that really was. Pure and simple, my ex-girlfriend thought that the best way to get back at me was to have sex with my friends. Maybe I had been a bad boyfriend, maybe she was crazy, or maybe I just had shitty friends. Whatever it was, she acted on her thoughts. The first one wasn\u2019t too bad. I wasn\u2019t too close with him anyway, and he had always liked Michelle. I figured this was finally his chance to be happy. The second one, though\u2026\u2026.that\u2019s where my heart shattered. It was obvious he and Michelle were hooking up. They walked around between classes, and you could see it in the way they talked to each other. But that was it. It was school, and I was spared from any more intimate scenes. Until one day after baseball practice. My friend (or ex-friend, at this point) lived down the road from my house. We had stopped hanging out the past month, and even though he lived so close, I never saw him. His black car was always in the driveway, and I never saw him outside. Driving back that day, I saw a different car\u2026..and I recognized it. It was Michelle\u2019s red truck. We weren\u2019t dating anymore, and we hadn\u2019t been together in over two months, but there was something about seeing Michelle\u2019s truck that day in my friend\u2019s driveway. For the first time in my life, I knew what heart break felt like. I went home that day and screamed into my pillow. I cried until I couldn\u2019t cry anymore, and then I screamed again. Life sucked. I got really into Blink 182 that year. I had been a fan since I was 12 years old, but all of a sudden their music sounded different to me. For the first time, I knew what they were singing about. It\u2019s funny how time works. When I saw her truck that day, I felt like the world was collapsing around me. The tears wouldn\u2019t stop after I went up to my room, and I felt like I was drowning. Zoom out and gain the perspective that a few years gives you, and everything takes on a humorous tone. I think about Michelle\u2019s truck now, and I laugh. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and give 17-year-old me a hug, but I don\u2019t think I would. Screaming into his pillow was probably good for him. High school love, man. That shit will kill you. ",

            "answer_text": "I had fallen in love with this man shortly after I graduated from College, We didn't lived in same state, he was three hours away and we made arrangement I come around and we spent every public holiday together either at mine or his. I hadn't love like that all my life. On one of my visits he got me engaged. By the way I had to chose between a ring and Christmas gifts. I regret that I chose the ring. This man was truly sincere and loved me. We were going to get married that year, my family loved him and accepted him as well. Then we made arrangement to travel down to his county home, it happened to be mine as well. On getting to his home to introduce me to his folk, they seems to be cool and nice to me, or I didn't read the signs well enough. His mom asked me to buy and send her stuffs, shoes and clothing, same as his sister and he seemed unconcerned about it. Then we made another trip to his home for his sisters marriage and a burial. At that event I met a larger family and got to get introduced, they insist I do the dishes used for all the events that day, it was lot of plates, I washed till my hands lost grip, then some little children; his niece came to my rescue, I didn't call them, they just joined me. After the events when travelled back together and then I left for my home oblivious of my fate. Then comes the events that will break us up. He started telling me terrible feedbacks about his family not being in support of our relationship, how they think I appear arrogant, how they don't like my family, and how I allow the kids help with the dishes, was one of my crime\u2026and the report won't stop coming in. He was weary of the issue, he seems to have insist he will go ahead initially then I heard they threaten he would die if he goes ahead to marry me. At that point I think he was getting tired. I must add I got to discover one of his brother had married my mother's niece and she wasn't a beloved of the family. That didn't matter to me because I was so in love and just want to be with this man I loved so much. We were then growing apart and I decided to pay him a visit, on that visit, the affection was gone! He told me he didn't want me to visit but his guts failed him to say it to me. He was so mean to me and no longer the loving darling I was used to. I stayed few days and returned home. We kept talking and I kept praying that it turned out well. I had no back up plan nothing extra but held on and prayed harder\u2026 my birthday was to be on the July 28, then on July 25, he called me up over the phone to say he is done and he won't continue with the relationship! That day I died! I don't know how I am still standing here today. Oh I wished it was a bad dream that will go away but I live with my truth. He was gone! I had to send back his ring by postal It been 5years now and I still couldn t love absolutely. He got married to someone else a year later and has his family now. We were never in touch and still it hard to love again. Now it gets harder because every sign seems like a red flag. I figured out I ignored a lot of it in that relationship. ",
