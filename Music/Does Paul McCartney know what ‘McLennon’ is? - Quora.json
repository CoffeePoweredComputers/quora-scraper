            "answer_text": "More likely than not I would say yes. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s possible for him not to know about it as there are many fans who believe in it. Although he is pretty old and so probably doesn\u2019t roam around social media to really see the extent of it. I\u2019m sure there were people back in the 60s who believed in McLennon (although maybe they didn\u2019t have the name. I\u2019m not sure when ship names became a thing) but for sure there were people who thought John and Paul were together on some level. I\u2019ve heard that people went around Apple calling Paul \u201cJohns Princess\u201d (although I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessarily true) and they did have a very close relationship so I\u2019m sure there are early Beatles fans who liked the idea of them together. Whether or not Paul has seen the art and the various fanfiction, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s something he really talks about much as he probably doesn\u2019t want to fuel people\u2019s fantasies if they\u2019re not true. I personally don\u2019t believe McLennon was a thing but don\u2019t have a problem with people who like it. They\u2019re cute together, I can understand the appeal of it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as problematic as other ships that aren\u2019t real because John is dead so no one is harassing Paul about needing to confess his love for him so they can be together. Shipping can be quite problematic, but I do it a lot too and as long as you realize what\u2019s appropriate and what\u2019s not I think it\u2019s a healthy way of understanding and appreciating relationships.

            "answer_text": "Yes. When the documentary about their touring years was being prepared, he suggested the director to visit you tube and look for the videos showing him and John. He was afraid the documentary would show them the way some people think: not being close friends. It doesn\u2019t mean he agrees with the McLennon theory, but it means he knows the meaning as he knows the videos. As the pictures used are true, ( though it doesn mean the theory is true) he thought it would be important to see how close they were. He also sent a note once to a page dedicated to some fan fictions about McLennon saying it was okay to keep on writing them but they had to let clear they were fiction. If it is clear enough they could go on writhing those beautiful stories. He indeed said they were beautiful. Only too strict people are mad about those stories. Paul doesn\u2019t mind. ",
