            "answer_text": "The word \"Bible\" comes from the Latin and Greek word \"biblia;\" the plural of \"biblion\" which means book. This word comes from the city of Byblos where papyrus was produced to make scrolls and later codices from which our modern books developed. The Bible is divided into two major sections or books: the books of the Old Testament and the books of the New Testament. The word \"testament\" (Latin = testamentus, Greek diatheke, and Hebrew = berit) means \"covenant\" or oath. According to Sacred Scripture Moses wrote the first 5 books of the Old Covenant. He began writing these books at Mt. Sinai (Exodus 24:7). As time went by other men, divinely inspired by God, added to the books of the Old Covenant. In addition to the Pentateuch (first 5 books by Moses) other Holy Spirit inspired texts were added which include the books of the Prophets and the Writings (poetry and wisdom texts). No official list of holy books was set until Ezra set the canon of the Old Covenant books circa 444 BC (some scholars date 425BC others 458BC). After Ezra first set the canon of the Old Covenant with the return of the Children of Israel after the rebuilding of the second Temple, other books continued to be added to the collection of documents which were considered by the Old Covenant people to be Sacred Scripture: 1 & 2 Maccabees, Tobit, etc. Some were written in Hebrew, some in Aramaic and others in the Greek language which became the international language after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332BC (Alexander died 323BC). In 250 BC the Hebrew collection of Sacred Scripture was translated for the first time into Greek. This translation was called the Septuagint (named for the 70/72 Hebrew scholars who worked on the translation). 1 & 2 Maccabees and other books were added after this first Greek translation. All 46 books that we have in our modern Old Testament translations were the same 46 books that Jesus read and studied. Saint Peter and the first century Church adopted the Septuagint translation and the 46 books of the Old Testament (Covenant) as the official Bible of the New Covenant Catholic (Universal) Church. ",

            "answer_text": "The biblical Jews based their whole lives on the Old Testament. To the Jew the Old Testament was everything that education as about, and it was the supreme judge in every controversy. JESUS When we turn to the teaching of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels, we don\u2019t only get one or two or three key statements, but we get host of quotations from the Bible (Old Testament) thrown up from a great variety of situations. When Christ preaches to the multitude, when he instructs his disciples, as he refutes his opponents and answers peoples questions, when Jesus is tempted by the devil at the beginning of his ministry, and then, when he gives his final instructions just before his ascension into heaven \u2026 all the way though Jesus\u2019 teaching, his attitude to the bible is consistent an unchanging. His attitude to the truth of history. To the authority of the teaching of the Old Testament. To the inspiration of the writing. All of this leads us to the firm and objective historical conclusion that: To Christ, the Old Testament was true, authoritative, and inspired. To him, the Old Testament was the teaching of the Living God. THE EARLY CHURCH As you would expect, the same reverent attitude towards the Old Testament appears everywhere in the Early Church. The decisive argument to the New Testament writer was always \u201cit is written\u201d in the book. And the very first Christian preaching was also of the Old Testament. The coming of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost (pente=50 days after the resurrection) was explained by the scriptures. The message of the resurrection of Jesus was also confirmed by the Old Testament scripture. And so, from the very beginning, Christianity was a religion with a book! Bible means book. Calling it the bible, is calling it the book. My only concern over the past 40 yrs of my life, has been to understand the contents of a book. ",
