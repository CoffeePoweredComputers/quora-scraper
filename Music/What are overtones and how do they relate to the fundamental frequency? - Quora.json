            "answer_text": "In general, overtones can be any relationship to the fundamental, provided only of course that they're higher (the fundamental is the lowest by definition). For resonators with two- and three-dimensional shapes, like drums and bells, the pattern of overtones tends to be messy and not musically pleasing unless someone has gone to a lot of trouble to tweak the shape to tune them - see e.g., Bell (instrument). However there are two important special cases where there's naturally a simple relationship between fundamental and overtones. The first is when a resonator is close to one-dimensional, as in a violin/guitar/piano string, or an air column in a flute/clarinet/organ pipe etc. Then you typically get a Harmonic pattern of overtones in which the wavelengths are in the ratio 1 (fundamental), 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 etc and the frequencies are in the ratios 1 (fundamental), 2, 3, etc. These are closely related to standard musical intervals such as the octave (2:1), fifth (3:2), major third (5:4) etc. (A conical air column such as in an oboe/sax/trumpet also has overtones with this relationship.) The second is when a resonator gives a complicated but periodic pattern, such as when the vocal cords flap together in a repetitive way to create a sung note (as opposed to the irregular pattern of even a sustained spoken sound). In that case, the technique of Fourier series can be used to decompose the complicated waveform into a set of sinusoids with the same harmonic relationship of frequencies. ",

            "answer_text": "All sounds are made of transient sine waves. So a sine wave is simply a boring sound (a bit like a flute). A transient sine wave is one where the loudness changes over time obviously starting and ending silent. If you then produce many of these with different transients, you can produce any sound possible. Now, it may take an infinite number of them, but that's what a sound is: some combination of transient pure tones (sine waves). Now, if you are looking to create a sustained musical note, then the selection of these sine waves determines what is known as the timbre of the sound. The timbre is just the character or unique \u201cfeel\u201d of the sound. For any real sound made musically, there will always be a fundamental (usually the lowest pitch / frequency and the loudest) pure tone (sine wave / flute sound). It is that pitch that will define the note that we recognize for the sound. Now, at some regular interval of higher frequency / pitch / less loud divisions (the key here is higher in frequency / pitch) are what are known as the harmonics of the fundamental. These higher harmonics are what are also known as overtones. They then, essentially define the timbre of the sound beyond what the fundamental contributes. Generally, the more overtones there are, the more complex and pleasing in character a timbre can be. Pick the wrong combination of them and you wind up with a dissonance that is worse sounding than any noise you've ever heard. So, musically, overtones really define the character of a sound. The fundamental determines the pitch or note of the sound. ",
