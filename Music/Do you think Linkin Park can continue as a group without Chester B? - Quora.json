            "answer_text": "Yes. Though it will undoubtedly change the band dramatically. Shinoda has indicated that the Band intends to go on. But he has also said that as of now they have no idea what form that will take. This would not be the first time a band has replaced a beloved front man. In fact it happens all the time, and is often successful. even when the front man was the entire public face of the band, but especially when as in LP\u2019s case, with Shinoda and Bennington, the band has multiple front men. People questioned Drowning Pool could go on after Dave Williams died, and their first attempt with Jason Jones was less than successful, but subsequently under Ryan McCombs and later Jasen Moreno they have found considerable renewed success. Adam Gontier\u2019s departure from Three Days Grace raised similar reservations, and initially when Matt Walst attempted too much to emulate Gontier there were problems, but as Walst found his own voice the band has found renewed success, and in fact it was Gontier himself who struggled longer to return to popular consciousness before finding his footing with S\u0394INT \u0394SONI\u0394. Peter Gabriel replaced Phil Collins with considerable success. VH1 has a list of other such successful replacements here: Roll With the Changes: Ranking Rock\u2019s Top 10 Replacement Lead Singers As a member of the LPU and Soldier (gah I still dislike the nickname for our fandom) from long ago, I admit to having a hard time imaging LP without Chester, but if Mike and Hahn say they intend to do it, then do I am sure they will do Chester proud.

            "answer_text": "At this point nobody knows. It is a very difficult position to be in. If they are to continue they would have to either do everything without Chester, or replace him. Neither of these possibilities seem right. How can you replace such a singer? And if you don\u2019t, and you would have the public sing his parts, what sort of emotional rollercoaster should you expect? There is no telling ,as the band members of the band don\u2019t know either. Speaking to Vulture last week, Shinoda said that he was \u201cunable to say what will happen with the band\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s really just no answer, and it\u2019s funny because if I even say anything about the band\u2019s future, that becomes the headline, which is stupid because the answer is there is no answer.\u201d \u201cFans think they want to know what the future is: Believe me, I want to know what the answer is. But there just isn\u2019t one.\u201d Read more at Mike Shinoda talks future of Linkin Park: \"The answer is there is no answer\" - NME ",

If you\u2019re interested, you can check out my ideas here. Personally, I can imagine Linkin Park doing releases in the far future. Maybe not so often. Maybe they wont even do full albums all that often. But, the guys have written together for so long, I can only imagine that they still show each other stuff and write with each other at least once in a while. No one\u2019s to say that someone like Brad or Joe didn\u2019t put in any ideas for Mike\u2019s new album \u201cPost Traumatic\u201d. When it comes down to it, anythings possible. Linkin Park can continue. It won\u2019t be the same, but really, with them, when has it? ",
