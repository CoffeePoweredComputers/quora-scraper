            "answer_text": "In one respect, not much. In another, a great deal. As far as being a musical instrument, the 1959 Les Paul Standard is almost exactly the same as the 2019 Les Paul Standard. The body is solid mahogany capped with an arched maple top. The neck is mahogany and the fretboard is rosewood. The pickups, beginning in 1957, are usually two humbuckers, but models are still made using p-90 single coils. The real guitar nerds will tell you that the 59 Les Paul was handmade using old-growth mahogany which is no longer available. This is true, how much of a difference it truly makes is endlessly debatable. The PAF pickups in 59 Les Pauls are a far bigger factor in their sound. The pickup winding machines Gibson used back then didn\u2019t have automatic shut-offs; so although each coil was supposed to have 5000 winds of wire some had more, some had less. Cumulatively all these factors: being predominantly hand made, the old-growth wood, the varying coils in the pups add up to a degree of variance from guitar to guitar that doesn\u2019t exist today. Today a lot of the woodworking is done by CNC machines - computer controlled machines that perform identical operations on piece of wood used in the guitar. The end result is that each Les Paul feels more or less the same. I say more or less because Gibson still does more stuff by hand than virtually any other maker. The necks, most importantly, are still shaped and sanded by hand. There is no such thing as two identical Les Pauls, and hopefully there never will be. In 1959, however, the market for electric guitars was a tiny fraction of what it is today. It didn\u2019t make sense to invest in automation when you were building and shipping only 500\u2013600 guitars per year. The 59\u2019s, being hand made, varied a great deal more from one to another in feel and sound. The good ones sound incredible; the bad ones are (apparently) a bitch to play. So, from that point of view, there really isn\u2019t anything that amazingly special about the 59 Les Paul. Plug in a brand new one and play both through the same amp and chances are most people won\u2019t be able to tell which is which by sound alone. And this is where the real answer lies. In 1965 Eric Clapton joined John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers as they were about to record a new album. Clapton, who was a huge Freddy King fan wanted to get closer to the deep, throaty, full-bodied blues sound he heard on Freddy\u2019s albums but couldn\u2019t replicate on his Fender Telecaster and Vox AC-30 amp. Freddy played a Gibson Les Paul. A 1956 goldtop with P-90\u2019s. Clapton went looking for the same guitar but the closest he could get in England at that time was a used 1960 Les Paul with humbuckers. He then visited Jim Marshall, a radio repairman who built amplifiers for London\u2019s growing number of blues and rock musicians. When Eric plugged his Las Paul into a 100 Watt Marshall amp he created the entirely new sound that would dominate rock music for the next 30 years. The Beano album, as it\u2019s known, was enormously influential. Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Paul Kossoff, Gary Moore and just about every other guitar hero you can name heard that album and wanted that sound. Problem was Gibson was no longer making the Les Paul guitar. So all these great players started looking for and playing used Les Pauls. The general consensus eventually being that of all the sunburst models (1958\u20131960) the 59 was the best. So basically a huge amount of the rock music you grew up listening to was made by guys playing 59 Les Pauls because at the time the records were made the only guitar that could deliver that sound was a used Les Paul. Fast forward thirty or forty years and the mythology factor has changed the story to give the 59 Les Paul mythical, magical properties that, to be perfectly honest, it never had. If Clapton had recorded the Beano album on a 2019 Les Paul I doubt if it would sound significantly different. So you add up the fact that only around 1500 \u201858\u2013\u201960 Les Pauls were made with their disproportionate use on the classic rock music of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s and you can see why they enjoy the status they do.

            "answer_text": "The special sound thing is a bit of myth, but also it has a bit of the truth. The design of the Les Paul is mainly a very thick piece of mahogany with a maple top laminated on to it with the humbucking pick ups of the time which were 30\u201340% more powerful than anything else on the market, made the Les Paul the deepest fullest sounding guitar around but it also had great sustain and bite in the higher registers. In 1958, 59 and 60 there was nothing like them out there - and they stopped making them because they didn\u2019t sell! When people like Jimmy Page, Clapton, and others made them more popular they started production again in 1968 but in a limited way. Of course when heavy duty rock came into style, the Les Paul was tailor made for it. But the newer models did not have the same resonant woods and pick-ups that the 58\u201360\u2019s models had. Now you can buy Historic Reissues that are every bit as good if not better than the revered \u201859. Also 50\u2019s manufacturing practices were not capable of the quality consistency we enjoy to day, so not every 58\u201360 LP has the same amount of fairy dust inside it. I have a 1974 Les Paul Standard, when I got it (in 1974) it sounded bigger and badder than anything I had previously heard. In 1986 I had the opportunity to play and buy a 1959 Les Paul at Voltage Guitars in Hollywood. It was hanging on the wall with the rest of the used guitars. It looked like crap. The Sunburst was mostly faded out and it had a greenish tinge to it. But it was a 59, so I had to check it out. I was handed a cord and I plugged into a mid-sized Fender Combo amp (I can\u2019t remember model it was) and played it for about 10 minutes. I did not feel any magical vibes coming from it. But it was a \u201859 so I had to ask, \u2018how much?\u2019 the answer: 5 grand! I had my no-limit Gold Amex card sitting there in my backpack and the money sitting in the bank - but 5 grand seemed like a little too much. When I didn\u2019t jump at it, the guy told me they had had it for a few months and the owner would probably accept a decent offer. Hmmm, I had two young kids at home so I settled for a cherry 68 Gibson SG just like Robbie Krieger\u2019s for $400. Of course, I just missed what would have been the greatest investment of my life, but who knew? I still have that SG today. I also have a 2005 Gibson 1959 Les Paul Reissue. It makes my 74 LP sound tight and trebley by comparison, and it sounds much better than I remember that real \u201959 sounding. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the 1959 instruments became noted because they were the first to have all the specifications that have - in retrospect - become the \u2018classic\u2019 Les Paul formula: Mahogany Body / Maple Cap, the then-new PAF Humbuckers, the burst finish, and the tune-o-matic tailpiece. This combination has become revered over time - but remember that Gibson couldn\u2019t sell them back in the day. They quickly ended this model, replacing it with the model we now know as the \u2018SG\u2019 (and even calling that new model the \u2018Les Paul\u2019). Remember also that during this time, guitarists generally enjoyed their status to play \u2018new\u2019 guitars. George Harrison used a brand new \u2018Les Paul\u2019 SG in the mid 60s. Hendrix used Strats right off the assembly line - including the now unfavored three bolt models. The idea of seeking out \u2018old\u2019 guitars just wasn\u2019t a thing. The mystique of the 59 Les Paul came about because it was the first guitar that the top players wanted that could not be bought new. Gibson wasn\u2019t making them (having switched to the \u2018SG\u2019 shape in 1960), and word quickly spread through the guitar-playing fraternity in the UK that the combination of features on the 59 bursts was worth trying, You can then trace out the efforts made by Clapton, Harrison, Page, Green, Kossoff to get their hands on one (sometimes famously passing the same instruments to one another). Gibson saw this demand and put the \u2018original\u2019 Les Paul back into production in 1968, but they didn\u2019t get it completely right. They still saw the \u2018sg\u2019 style as being at a more compelling market offering, so they didn\u2019t go all-in on replicating the 1959. These small differences (headstock angle, neck shape, fingerboard width, etc.) caused people to seek out the 1959-era models. Were they THAT much better? Probably not, but this just added to the mystique that these instruments have. In recent years, Gibson has made great strides in \u2018perfecting\u2019 the Les Paul formula. Today\u2019s \u201cLes Paul Standard 50s\u201d at $2500 gets you awfully close. If you really must have the exact same guitar as a 1959 burst down to the plastics and markings, you can pay up ($6500) for a \u201cReissue\u201d. These guitars go to great lengths to copy the most loved features from the most loved 59 guitars. So how different are these \u2018new\u2019 guitars from Gibson from the real thing - a 1959 burst? It\u2019s hard to tell because of the immense aura that comes from playing a guitar worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. There are some really good YouTube videos where seasoned players play both blindfolded, and the results are mixed. Certainly the wood is \u2018different\u2019 now than back in the day - both due to the age of the wood being used and the time it\u2019s had to dry. I have a 1953 Les Paul that\u2019s been \u2018converted\u2019 (by someone else a long time ago - I didn\u2019t touch it!) to 1959 specs, and it does feel a bit lighter than the modern guitars. The wood resonates well and feels good, but it\u2019s not an entirely-different-experience from playing a new Les Paul (I have several). In some ways, the Les Paul is a victim of its past, and the legend that grew out of those blues players \u2018discovering\u2019 it in the mid 60s after it had briefly gone out of production. All Les Pauls are now judged by their degree of similarity to that model, rather than their inherent worth. One example of this is in the bridge posts - 1959 guitars screwed the studs that support the bridge directly into the guitar top. In some ways, this is a pretty primitive solution - it means that if you have to take them out for service, the hole won\u2019t be the same size when you put it back. Screws don\u2019t go in and out of wood multiple times without leaving changes (ask anyone who has a Fender screwed-in neck). So, Gibson upgraded this by putting bushings in the body into which a machine screw could be attached. With this \u2018setup\u2019, you can now remove and reattach the bridge studs multiple times without weakening the joint - by all outward notions - this is a significant upgrade. Oh, but that\u2019s not how they did it in 1959, so now - crazily - this is probably the first spec that people look at to see if the guitar has \u2018real\u2019 1959 specs. If the bridge posts are sunk right into the wood top the old fashioned way, it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d - even though \u2018better\u2019 makes little sense. (An aside - I am aware of the arguments that the wood/post joint somehow magically transmits tone from the strings to the body). But still, even for someone who doesn\u2019t believe that the old-style posts make better tone, it becomes an easy signpost to look at the \u2018level\u2019 of a guitar. The nicer guitars have the \u2018Historic\u2019 specs like the ABR-1 original style into-the-wood posts. Sometimes these spec changes are more material - most \u2018consumer\u2019 level non-\u2019reissue\u2019 Les Pauls use a shorter neck tenon (the part of the neck that extends down into the body). This probably saves Gibson some money, wood, and time, and is easier for them to do. But to be truly \u201959 spec\u2019, you need the long neck tenon, so that becomes another signpost that distinguishes the \u2018production\u2019 guitars from the \u2018historic\u2019 guitars. They also started taking away wood to make the guitars lighter by chambering or drilling out material under the top in many modern guitars, which the \u2018tone police\u2019 like to call out, so folks seek out the full-on-no-weight-relief versions. Can the average player hear or feel the difference between a guitar that has a long neck tenon, weight relief, and screwed-in bridge posts? Probably not. In fact, the sonic difference between those two methods is probably less than the variability between one instance of a guitar from 1959 and another. Still, the culmination of all of these changes over time makes the guitar just feel a bit different. Let me say this: Any Gibson Les Paul with more-or-less traditional specs (maple/mahogany, quality GIbson humbuckers, etc.) is a pretty nice guitar to play. Any one properly set up would suit just about any player for learning through recording and touring. Leave the \u2018real\u2019 1959s to the collectors and speculators. Having one in your hands won\u2019t make you a better player. There is no magic. These are all high-quality instruments (when made well - Gibson does - and did in 1959 - make plenty of guitars with flaws). If the one you get your hands on was glued together right by folks in the factory who were paying attention on the day they put that particular guitar together - congratulations, you\u2019re a winner. There were winning guitars that came out in 1953, 1959, 1968, 1979, and 2019. Shop well and for a little more than $2,000 you can own a \u2018real\u2019 Les Paul that is functionally and sonically equivalent to a mythical 1959 \u2018burst\u2019 that sells for $400,000. ",

            "answer_text": "There's damn all of them about, and a lot of idiots who want to own one! My cousin works for a major rare guitar dealer, frequently flying around the world escorting five- and six-figure instruments to new owners, and so has actually had the chance to play a few as they've passed through the shop. His verdict - when they're good, they're amazing; when they're bad, they're an investment! Supposedly it's the mix of the timber and the PAF pickups, but there's massive variation in both; hardly surprising since they were still handmade instruments at the time. There's slight variations in neck and body sizes and shapes, particularly the necks as they were sanded from rough blanks. Nothing major - 1/8 inch thicker or thinner - but enough to feel different. Similarly, the pickups were supposedly hand-wound to a certain number of turns of copper, but if someone wasn't paying attention, pickups got over-wound and hot! And since a humbucker uses two coils, there was no guarantee that those coils would be evenly matched, creating different cancellation in each unit. Also the original design specified AlNiCo 4 magnets, but Gibson would use whatever variety of magnet was in stock to avoid slowing production! The other thing to remember is that most of the famous players who used them and created the myth of the \"59\" (Page, Green, Clapton, Jeff Beck) didn't buy them because they were legendary instruments - they bought them because they were cheap workhorses! The things were a sales disaster, much like the famous Flying Vs that got hung outside as shop signs. Even though production stopped in 1960, shops were still trying to shift them as new in 1962. Import taxes in the UK meant that most guitarists couldn't afford a top quality guitar - the average wage was around \u00a315 p/w and a new Strat was \u00a3120! IIRC, each of the four I mentioned picked their guitars up second-hand in American guitar stores and pawn shops for very little, on tours when they were still unknowns. It's what they did with them that has made the guitars almost priceless. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing more than any other vintage guitar. What basically makes vintage guitars vintage is the old production method that took in relatively more manual work. Pickup winding, magnet charging, body cutting and carving were all done manually; so each guitar fundamentally sounded a little different from the others while maintaining its identity within its kind at the same time. Did you notice the contradiction yet? well ironically no one 1959 les paul can sound the same as another for the aforementioned reason and so identifying a vintage les paul by brand name and date makes no particular sense except for maybe bringing the title into a supposedly 'wow!' sonic category that is marketed to be omni-pleasant or something. All the hype is just consumerist mentality and ignorance. All old guitars will have more or less equal amounts of manual work gone into the construction stages that 'matter'. Like the electronics, the playability will vary from guitar to guitar because the neck and the rest of the body will have been carved manually too. You want a vintage guitar, you gotta check each one out separately and pick the one that clicks. It could be one generally considered crappy that you'd fall in love with and it could be a $50000 gibson '59 you would totally hate (if not blinded by the hype). You could even like one '59 over another, howzat? Thats the fun with vintage guitars; your sound and playing is exclusively yours at its core. I have a way cheaper vintage yamaha SL500 les paul copy that two gibson owners have proposed a swap with so far; and i declined ;) ",

            "answer_text": "I knew an old gentleman in the 70's who worked at the Gibson factory in the 1950's.  He left Gibson to work for Guild in the 60's. He told me the pickups were wound by hand back then.  I can't vouch for that, other than going by what he said, but it sounds right.   I do know this much about the 1950's and 60's.  In general, American craftsmanship was held to a high standard during that era.  People took pride in their work, even if you were an auto mechanic working at a gas station.  Workmen took their time and did things right, often going above and beyond what was expected of them.  Maybe that's part of the mystique.   I've never done a side by side comparison of a new Les Paul to one of the vintage models so it would be unfair for me to comment on that, but I do understand the lure of vintage instruments.  They seem to have a personality of their very own. ",

Excellent sound for rock and blues (duh!)What I didn't expect was what a great jazz sound they both had. Front pickup, tone on 10, guitar volume down to 6-ish, super clean amp setting. Really sweet jazzy sound, almost like an L-5. They were both really good, well-made guitars. The real reason they're so well-regarded though is because of their association with our heroes. They're a status symbol for today's players. Mike Bloomfield played one, Clapton played one, Peter Green's went to Gary Moore, Duane Allman, Paul Kossoff, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and the list goes on and now they're prized by the next generation - Slash et al.

So a lot is just the allure \u2026 you can get good and bad sounding guitars from any era. And not many were made. Its \u201cprobable\u201d that there are now more \u201959s around than were made in 1959 by Gibson. ",

First off, the '59 has mythical status because a few star players had one and swore by them (usual geezers, Keef, Clapton, Beck, Green, etc). I'm 2015, anything from '58-'60 is just as desirable. For these are the years of the PAF humbucker and sunburst finish. Also, there were around 1700 instruments total all three years. They were a complete failure in the market and Gibson stopped making them completely in 1961 in favor of the SG. Think about that for a second. So scarcity is what drives the price ever higher into the \"Stratosphere\" sorry could not resist guitar pun. That's why you won't ever find one. The precise location and status of almost every one of these guitars has already been investigated, obsessed over, and resolved as much as music and history can ever be. Maybe there's one or two out there somewhere ... It's a big world. But probably not. ",

Best guitar I ever played was the 58. the 60 was not as good, played a 59 that was not worth the 140k paid for it as an instrument, not a bad guitar but not worth it. In fact I like my 58reissue better. I have played 53\u20136LP that were just as good and 57 that were better. First a good one has a feel like broken in jeans or shoes, it makes you want to play it ,the fretboard has a oily warmth. the body is light n resonant. The sound is bright and has presence but not shrill. played clean they are warm and articulate cranked up they are defined and the overdrive has great clarity and sing like a voice. Add to that the wood was different: specipies wise, older slow growth trees and dried slower, also the nitro was different then todays. Add to that a dozen other minor things that we can\u2019t duplicate due to deforestation , industrial changes and lost skills. I would say my RI LP gets 80 to 90% of all these traits. So great instrument but they are also now objectd\u2019art and command prices in excess of their music making worth. ",

That meant that if you wanted to own a great Les Paul, you wanted to get an old one\u2014but you couldn\u2019t. Tokai made some very good copies, as did luthiers such as John Diggins. However, this just pushed the price of the originals up even higher. At a particular point, the spiral made them collectible purely as bank investments, which reduced availability even more. If you can find one now, it is probably damaged and repaired, and it will still cost you the price of a new Ferrari. Objectively, you can get an identical instrument from Gibson today \u2014 not just generally identical, but absolutely identical to a particular guitar. But that, too, just pushes the prices of the originals up more. ",

The wood, the pickups, and especially, the old guys who knew how to put them together and finish them off.The old guys who knew how to make \"nibs\" and file frets and detail-shave a neck.Between the old guys and the quality wood, there was a magic imparted that one can feel and hear. But some of them were dogs and some of the new ones are fine. ",
