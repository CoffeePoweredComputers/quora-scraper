            "answer_text": "There is surprisingly a simple and free way of doing this. For the past year, I have been using a service called Soundrop to distribute my music on music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, Pandora, Google Play, Youtube, and Deezer. The thing I love about this company is the stress free service, the ability to release cover songs for a really good price (let\u2019s say you pay $10 to release it from Soundrop instead of paying 9.1 cents for every stream or download of the cover song. If you have 1000 plays on the cover song you will be paying exactly $910. With using Soundrop, it\u2019s a one time fee), they are very easy to work with, release to all major streaming services, they don\u2019t charge ANYTHING when it comes to releasing original stuff, and much more. The reason I am saying to use Soundrop instead of other platforms is not only because they are free, it\u2019s also because their rules/guidelines cover everything, but still makes it stress free. I released my first album using the distribution service known as Tune Core. It costs $30 to upload an album, and $50 to be able to use the service for a year. When I used this service, they were incredibly strict. It took 3 times to get my album sent to stores, but I had to wait for them to read through every change I made. So it took forever. Tune Core does offer a lot, but I suggest to not use it. Back to Soundrop. When you upload a album, they do require you to have a 3000x3000 pixel album cover. My least favorite part about releasing anything, is the process of finding someone to make a good and affordable cover. The only downside about distributing a album with ANY distribution service is that it takes 3 months to receive your first paycheck from the album. After that it takes 1 month to get the money. There a whole system behind this, I recommend you check out why it takes 3 months at first. A word of advice for you is make sure your song is mastered (you can Google what I mean by that). Without mastering, your song(s) won\u2019t sound as professional as it could be. You can hire people on Fiverr to do it. In my early years of distributing albums, I\u2019ve learned that mastering is a must have. I highly support what you are doing. I find it amazing how you want to take a new step in your musical journey. You are well on your way to making a hit song! Two more things, don\u2019t listen to the haters. You need to learn not to be insulted by hate. I\u2019ve been insulted countless amounts of times, but never was hurt by it. I actually laugh when it happens. And finally, if you want to reach a bigger audience, once again you should use Fiverr. Fiverr offers music marketing services offered by the sellers. If you have 1000 streams on Apple Music after advertising, it\u2019s a well earned $6.40. I really look forward to hearing your song on Spotify and all. I\u2019ll definitely download it from Apple Music! Send me a message with a link to your music once it\u2019s released. Once again, I find it amazing how you want to take on a new adventure in music. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing. You are an amazing person for wanting to do this, it takes a lot of courage. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all are you a songwriter or a lyricist? There is a huge difference. If you only write lyrics but no actual music then you are really a poet unless you are working with a composer and writing lyrics specifically for the music that has been composed. I am a songwriter and I write both lyrics and music. Secondly it\u2019s not like there are a lot of people out there just waiting to buy your songs. Unless you have connections with either an artist, Producer or record label selling your songs is extremely difficult. Even then you really don\u2019t make much money initially for someone doing your song you make the most money if the song does well in the form of royalties. I have actually given songs away and made nothing until and if the song sells and then I eventually get money from the royalties. People are under the misconception that songwriting is easy and you can make a ton of money writing songs. For every songwriter that can make a living writing songs there are thousands of songwriters who make little to nothing from their work. Sorry but this is simply the harsh reality of the music business. I have been doing this for many years and while I have made money I haven\u2019t made enough to survive and like many songwriters I have a regular job to support myself. others will probably give you various links where you can submit your song or lyrics but the chances of them buying them or even responding to you at all are very very slim.
