            "answer_text": "Let me tell you one thing about me...that i never thought i would be listening to rap the way i do now.Thanks to Recovery! Recovery to me is his best work yet.The songs are just outstanding,have an incredible depth in lyrics and have great production work gone behind them.Contrary to his previous work this time he relies heavily on the quality of his work only and doesn't entertain \"shock\" value themes.On top of it he has great collaborations on several of the songs of this album and almost all are equally commendable. Though i had listened and loved his songs like \"Lose Yourself\",\"Cleaning Out My Closet\",\"When I'm Gone\" and other great songs from his previous albums,it was not until Recovery that i actually got myself addicted to the rap genre.This is hands down his best work yet ,at least according to me.And ten nominations at the Grammys 2011 including Album of the Year,Rap Album of the Year,Record of the Year and Song of the Year only reaffirm my belief. \"Not Afraid\" should alone be sufficient enough to keep this album in listeners' memories for years to come,i guess.

            "answer_text": "Let me just first say that I consider myself a huge Eminem fan. With that out of the way, I have to comment that I have been moderately disappointed by both of his recent albums, Relapse and Recovery. As lyrically pleasing as the latter may be, I find that Eminem has lost a bit of his edge. Rather than going out and rapping about the issues that matter to him, it seems to me that he's sold out a bit and folded to external pressures by writing out what is definitely a \"softer\" album by his standards. At the end of the day, however, I remain a loyal fan of my two favorite albums by him, The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show. ",
