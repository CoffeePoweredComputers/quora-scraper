            "answer_text": "How to Master Vocals Using Audacity  Step 1 Click \"File\" on the main Audacity tool bar and select \"Open.\" Browse to the location of the vocal track that you want to master. Highlight the file and click the \"Open\" button. Step 2 Click \"Edit\" in the main tool bar and highlight \"Select.\" Click on the \"All\" option from within the Select drop-down menu. Step 3 Click \"Effect\" in the main tool bar and select \"Amplify.\" Enter a value of \" -6.0 db\" into the dB field, and make sure that both check boxes are ticked. Click the \"OK\" button to normalize the audio. Step 4 Click \"Effect\" in the main tool bar and select \"Equalization.\" Click the \"Select Curve\" drop-down menu to expand the selection of equalization curves. Select the desired equalization curve from the list by clicking on it. Press the \"Preview\" button to hear a sample of your audio with the applied equalization curve. Step 5 Click within the Equalization Grid to add new points to the curve. Click and drag the curve to reposition it within the grid. Press the \"Preview\" button to hear a sample of your audio with the altered equalization curve. Continue manipulating the curve until you are satisfied with the result. Consider small EQ changes to problem frequencies. Areas to watch are extreme low bass, below 80 hertz, where too much content can make things muddy and indistinct. Frequencies around 400 to 600 hertz can often be lowered a little bit to balance highs and lows, and sibilant frequencies can be addressed with cuts anywhere between about 3,500 to 10,000 hertz, depending on the voices. Select \"GVerb\" from the effects menu if you wish to put a little reverb on the entire mix. This is sometimes handy for blending voices and instruments together. Generally you will want only a touch of reverb.  Type \"40\" into GVerb's Roomsize field. Enter \"4\" for Reverb time, \"0.9\" for Damping and \"0.75\" for Input bandwidth. Type \"0\" into the Dry Signal Level field, \"-22\" into the Early Reflection Level field and \"-28\" into the Tail Level field. Play with the parameters until it is difficult to tell if there is any effect on at all, then compare it with the muted copy. You will likely be surprised how much reverb is on your mastered version. Beware of adding too much. Open \"Compressor\" from the \"Effects\" menu. Compressors and limiters smooth out dynamic changes, making tracks sound more \"punchy.\" This is an effect that can also be overused, so start with modest settings like a ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 and short attack and release times. Uncheck the \"Make-up Gain\" box unless you are mastering a high-energy, loud song. Step 6 Click the \"OK\" button within the Equalizer menu to apply the equalization curve to the audio file. Step 7 Click \"File\" in the main tool bar and select \"Export.\" Select the desired audio format from the \"Save As Type\" drop-down box to .wav and click the \"Save\" button to export the mastered audio file.
