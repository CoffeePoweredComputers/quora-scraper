            "answer_text": "Not at all! I started dabbling at 30, got serious at 31 and am now 33 years old. I have been working as a software developer for the last 1+ years in the SF/Bay Area. My educational background is not even in the sciences, I went to UC Berkeley and majored in Political Science. Worked in marketing and sales for 8 years. I had never touched programming prior to turning 30 and knew almost nothing about what it actually entailed. I had always been a fan of computers and logic and logical puzzles and programming turned out to be more of that sort of reasoning than the mathematics I had always heard it associated with. Needless to say, I had the wrong idea about it for much of my life based on how many would describe it. I made some sacrifices to build my skills in the following couple of years. First I took on an internship \u2014 unpaid, after just a few community college intro courses to get a sense of the production experience at a small startup. Secondly, after 6 months at the startup, I decided to invest a decent amount of saving into an extended (6 months) Bootcamp focused on full-stack javascript development. There were times in my learning process that I had to rely on family and step away from full-time work. My goal was to spend as much time as possible writing code. A programmer/mentor/friend gave me some advice early which I decided to follow on faith and it turned out to be truest of all for my success. My friend had just refused to offer me a fulltime job after I had been casually programming for about 6 months. I demanded to know why and what I could do to improve. My programmer mentor told me then: \u201cYou just need your 10,000 hours\u201d He was referring to the theory that experts are ppl who have done 10k hours of work in something. Well, to this day I would say I am still a ways away from 10k hours, but with a few thousand under my belt I have to say I am utterly amazed at how far I have come! If you had asked me if I could be this capable just one year prior I would have confidently told you. No, no way! I am currently the principal front-end engineer for my startup employer and have built everything from simple websites, to a Chrome extension, to a mobile application using React-Native technology. My salary is competitive with the Bay Area, six figures. Maybe a bit less than someone with a college degree, but this is also my first full role and I am doing much better than many other BC grads. That being said I def think that I pushed MUCH harder than many of my peers exactly because I felt like an old fart compared to some of the 24 years old in the program. In the end, I was among the highest performing students in my cohort and did a lot to expand on the school\u2019s assignments, challenging myself to go further. As far as getting hired was concerned, focusing on Javascript was the right call, as web development is a nice bridge between hardcore computer science and highly in demand web programming. There are nice opportunities and lots of demand for web developers of various calibers, and the hands-on experience you receive building on the web is a great way to build your first 1,000 hours or expertise in programming and problem-solving. That being said, finding my first job was the last great hurdle. Here in the Bay Area there are many options for various levels of ability, but the competition is also high. It may take you up to 6 months to find a job, not to mention the stigma of Bootcamp training being a real phenomenon. But if you are committed to making the change and not abandoning gradual progress the rewards are immense. I make more money, have a nicer life experience. Have a flexible skill I can sell to the highest bidder over any internet connection if I decide to step away from full-time office work. Everything that is said about the future of tech is absolutely true once you are in the industry. I sometimes work long hours, but I enjoy the process and the final product and am compensated well enough that I know that I won't have to keep working until I am 75 years old. So no, 30 years old was not too old for me to start programming, it was, in fact, the perfect time. I had matured enough to take on this challenge and pursue it full throttle. Don\u2019t let your age stop you from improving your life 10x fold. ",

            "answer_text": "(Side point: your question from a programming standpoint is a little ambiguous. It could be a question about learning your first language or learning your tenth. However, I think it's safe to assume that it's your first. Right?)So, the default answer to this question is going to be \"It's never too late.\" That's the optimistic one size fits all answer. However, I'd say that it depends on your goal. If you just want to learn a programming language to be able to put it on your resume and never touch it again, go right ahead, read a tutorial, do the examples, slap that statement on your resume. If you want to change fields to programming from something entirely different because you heard that the job market was booming... then you might want to ask yourself a couple questions. (I think this goes for anyone. Not just 30 year olds.)1. Do I enjoy solving difficult problems? Programming is all about solving one problem after another. It begins with a problem. You program the solution piece by piece making sure that you don't write any bugs into the code. If there's a bug, it's another problem to solve. So, if you don't get a kind of high after solving a sudoku or math problem, then it's going to be difficult to battle your way through the frustrating parts of programming when you don't have the solution.2. Am I mentally flexible, yet logical?If something absolutely doesn't work one way because you've completely exhausted your ideas on how to fix it, then you have to be able to come up with a different idea of how it should work. By \"how it should work,\" I mean that the computer is going to do exactly what you tell it to do in a logical manner. It should work if what you tell it to do logically leads to the goal you had in mind. So, you have to be able to think outside of one box, while staying within the confines of another. Additionally, programming is always changing. So you have to evolve with it.3. Do I like planning ahead?If you don't like planning ahead, I definitely hope I never see your code. It's probably going to come out a sloppy, jumbled mess, that, if it works, only works because of luck. When solving a problem, one has to know the end goal and generally how it's going to look. If no one knows what it's going to look like, then you'll program endlessly and never get anywhere. Finally,4. Am I going to stick it out?Programming can be challenging. There are times when you're going to hit really hard walls, and it's going to feel like you're just hitting your head against the wall, but you've got to solve the problem because your pay depends on it. The high of solving a problem might get you started on the next problem, but the anticipation of the solution is just going to make you more frustrated when you get stuck. That's when you just have to push through and just keep going. If you've said yes to those questions, I'm not sure if that covers all the requirements, but I think it's a good start. By 30, you've probably determined whether you have these qualities, so that should make your decision easier than someone just starting out. If you don't have these qualities, then programming might just be a frustrating mess and waste of time. If you have these qualities and you do start programming, it's going to be very rewarding for you. Imagine the ability to create worlds from pretty much nothing. To be able to organize worlds with lines of code. To be able to keep learning things in an ever expanding field. It's pretty awesome, and if you're willing to stick it out, we're all going to live to at least 150 anyway (very possibly), so you're going to have a great time for a long time. ",
