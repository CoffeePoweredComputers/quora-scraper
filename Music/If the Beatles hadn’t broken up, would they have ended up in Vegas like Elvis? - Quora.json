            "answer_text": "I really don't think so. The Beatles were far too unique, talented and strong willed to wind up as cheesy Vegas performers. You have to understand that Elvis reached his peak fairy quickly and by the time he got out of the army his teeny bopper following had mostly grown up so he started making crappy movies just to stay busy and to keep his name out there. The Beatles were so creative, so unique that even after they stopped touring and \u201cBeatlemania\u201d had faded at the end of 1966, they continued to progress make even better music. They transcended the conventional pop star image and when their original fan base had matured, they matured along with them. If their last album \u201cAbbey Road\u201d is any indication, they still had a few good albums left in them had they not broken up. Someone once said \u201cYou either grow with music or music outgrows you\". The Beatles always managed to stay slightly ahead of the rest. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt it. Elvis ended up in Vegas through the machinations of the Colonel. The Beatles had no manager after Brian died and couldn't agree on anything among themselves. Only Paul wanted to play live again. I don't think that the kind of audience there was at Vegas would have liked The Beatles. The Beatles were the long-haired hippie breed of rock. The Vegas audience at the time were an older more conservative demographic who just wouldn't have gone for them. ",
