            "answer_text": "Nobody seems to have mentioned the damage which will have been done to his voice by smoking for all those years! He's definitely damaged his voice. One only has to listen to how he sounded in the 60s/70s and compare that against how he sounds now. There's a clearly noticeable difference.Hope I can sing that good when I'm 76.Hope I can sing when I'm 76.Hope I'm still alive at 76. As others have mentioned he was not untrained and sang in a choir for some time (his judicious use of plagal cadences giving away just how much he was influenced by church music too). He had an extraordinarily versatile voice which possessed great range of both pitch and dynamics and he wrote songs to utilise this range. With age he has lost some of the extremes of his range and some breath control. The notes which now sound \"bad\" only sound that way because they were really impressive notes in the first place. I find people underestimate just how high some of the stuff he sang was because he didn't make it sound difficult - pretty much anything over a high Ab for a guy is a high note and there are numerous examples of James/Paul/Billy exceeding this. That's not restricted to studio recordings either - I believe he hits a high C at the end of the middle section of Live And Let Die! People I have known always told me there are only two types of songs they always have to consider lowering the keys for. These are Freddie Mercury songs and Paul McCartney songs. They don't really sound all that good in lower keys either. Too often the magic vanishes. If this was the world of sport then he used to be Usain Bolt but now he's only the fastest guy at his local running club, but he's still faster than me. When he played that gig on the James Corden carpooling show it definitely sounded like Ob-La-Di was in a lower key (I didn't check but it felt more like A or Ab) so I think he's now having to take action to be able to do some of his songs.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure that to some extent he has done some damage but it is probably minor. I would dispute what was said about Oh Darling though. It took him forever to get that track down because he was looking for a sound that was similar to the sound John had on Twist and Shout. He wanted it to sound as if he had been singing all night and wanted it to sound raw and raspy but with every take he thought it sounded too clean and clear. He sang it many times during the day and it was still cleaner than he wanted it to sound. This was directly from McCartney in a couple of interviews. A good singer regardless of whether he is trained or not knows his voice well enough to know it\u2019s limitations. I was the singer in a band for many years and often had to sing 5 hours a night 5 days a week. One trick is to not sing too many challenging songs in a row. You line up your songs so you sing several that are fairly easy to sing and then song one that is harder, Singing the easier ones gives your voice a chance to warm up well before singing a song like Helter Skelter. Also you well notice that he sang sangs that were well within his range. If you have ever seen McCartney live in person or on video then you can see what I;m talking about. He is a master of arranging his songs so he is well in his comfort zone. As any singer gets older his voice will change and they will lose some range and also after years of singing your vocal chords will get thicker as well. No such thing as having no damage if you are a singer for many years but great singers can compensate well like McCartney. ",
