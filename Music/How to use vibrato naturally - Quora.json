            "answer_text": "If your larynx (Adam\u2019s Apple) goes up and down, it depends on how much. The slightest amount is not really an issue, but ideally it should be stable unless you are doing it deliberately on occasion for character pieces or style. If you attach a recording and or video showing you in profile while singing, others can see it and hear whether the vibrato is natural or a wobble or false vibrato. Natural vibrato is produced with open throat and consistent flow of air making the vocal folds come together faster. ",
