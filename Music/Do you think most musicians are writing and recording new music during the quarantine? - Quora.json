Of course, the musicians I hang out with are all experimental / electronic musicians. But I would imagine that\u2019s what most musicians with time on their hands and no live gigs are probably doing ",

They play covers because it\u2019s easy, and that\u2019s all they ever did.Creating original music requires them to develop their own original creative talent.It\u2019s too hard for them to do because they never did it before. They would rather pretend to be an artist by copying a real artist.But in reality they are just pathetic fakes making a mockery of the art of music. ",

Since you can't really travel, there are no gigs, a perfect time to dust off some of those half baked song ideas or to dream up some new ones and see what you can come up with. Good time to reconnect with friends and family and God, from whom all good things flow. ",
