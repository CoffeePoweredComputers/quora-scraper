            "answer_text": "Like others, I don't see what a band still playing shows has to be embarrassed about, far as aging. I think it's fans in the audience who feel self-conscious, maybe a bit embarrassed, seeing such a graphic reminder of how long and far gone their own youths are - up onstage like a not very well-preserved moose. People who say \u201cThey're embarrassing, they ought to go away and hide\u201d - it's so they don't have to contemplate their own accelerating decrepitude. That crowd, they're the embarrassing ones if you like. They say Rock and Roll is about youthful defiance, and they say you should pack it in now please, so I can be not so embarrassed by my own aging. Sorry, no. Rock and Roll is about defiance that never grows up, defiance that's gonna show its stuff no matter what. A defiance that's immune to yours or anyone else's (or its own) embarrassment. A heroic defiance. The legendary bluesmen aped by acts like the Stones kept playing in clubs into their seventies, eighties, even nineties, sitting on a bar stool with one spotlight and playing to whoever showed up 'til their fingers gave out. I think it'd be fitting if the Stones did the same, if they get that far. Admittedly (and sadly), many of those blues legends kept playing because they were more or less destitute! But some of them weren't, and went on anyway. The act of going on is still far more heroic than to go away and hide so people don't have to be ashamed by aging. In that spirit, I will give my pick for the band I feel has been hit most tragically hard by aging, the example that breaks my heart. AC/DC. Over a period of less than two years, AC/DC went from a band in top form, all five members of their classic Back In Black lineup, to a devastated remnant. Founding guitarist and songwriter Malcolm Young, incapacitated by dementia (Young passed away Nov. 2017). Iconic no-nonsense timekeeper, drummer Phil Rudd, to drug abuse and bizarre legal problems. The final nail, singer Brian Johnson, forced into retirement by hearing loss. Lead guitarist Angus Young limped through the final tour with replacement parts, most notably Axl Rose. Longtime bassist Cliff Williams retired after the tour wrapped. Unlike many of the bands on this list, AC/DC had been making great new music right up to the end (albeit with characteristic long gaps between albums). 2008\u2019s Black Ice saw them make the cover of Rolling Stone, as they found themselves critics' darlings for what must have been the first time in their careers. They'd simply outlasted the critics they'd never impressed; the current generation was as fond of them as an old dog they'd grown up with. And why not? Black Ice and 2014\u2019s ill-omened but excellent Rock or Bust were chock full of the sneering, thumping, choogling, swaggering singalongs the band pioneered, perfected, and never abandoned. This was a band that was lapping the competition right up 'til the wheels fell off. Heartbreaking, to watch it unfold. They didn't embarrass themselves. But I've never had it more painful to see a band get hit by age. Still, I feel they can be proud. Unlike so many other acts their age not acting their age, they had something to give us more than nostalgia. They\u2019d put out new albums and tour them. They'd always work a few of the new tracks into their jam-packed set list - and they sounded brilliant; the crowd cheered them like favorites. The loss was all the more poignant because this band had plenty more to give. Not something you can say for a lot of these bands. Latest word is - almost unbelievably - Angus says he's going to soldier on, possibly with Axl Rose. I'm sad for Brian, but there's not the slightest doubt in my mind that Malcolm would be proud. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve noticed a fair few answers seem to be focusing on looks, so instead, I\u2019ll focus on the music side of things\u2026 Now, I\u2019ve been into rock and it\u2019s various genres for years, I\u2019m not old by any stretch, but most of my life, the music I\u2019ve been around has been rock and it\u2019s various genres. Being a gamer, that has also helped me to discover other songs and bands\u2026 Like L7, which I discovered while playing GTA San Andreas, no doubt, we all know what the song is. It might also seem strange that my first concert wasn\u2019t until earlier this year, and to add to that, it was a festival\u2026 Great environment for a shy introvert\u2026 \u201cAnd we pretend that we\u2019re dead (pretend we\u2019re dead)\u201d Seriously though, just take a look at this live performance from 1992\u2026 It ain\u2019t perfect, but just wait\u2026  Now, when I went to Download, L7 was one the bands I wanted to see. Unfortunately, they were the only band I saw that I was utterly disappointed with. Still better than Boston Manor though\u2026 Seriously though, watch this:  Maybe it was a bad gig? Try this.  L7 ain\u2019t pretending to be dead on stage, they are dead, and the vocal work isn\u2019t much better either. For my next submission I present my all time favourite artist and his band  It\u2019s no secret that Ozzy hasn\u2019t been kind to his body, and for anyone to be still rocking like he does at the ripe age of 69, soon to be 70, it\u2019s crazy. But I\u2019m not just talking about Ozzy here, I\u2019m talking about the sound as a whole. Now, let me just throw a few examples in here. First, I\u2019ll look at Crazy Train, then move on to shot in the dark. I\u2019ll do my best to link videos here, but copyright around Ozzy\u2019s music is tight as hell, so videos may be blocked in your country. Randy Rhoads Era This is the original album version 1980:  Now in this case, I said I wasn\u2019t just looking at Ozzy, but for this example, it\u2019s literally just Ozzy. This is within 2 years of releasing the song (I wana say 1982, but it might be \u201881):  It isn\u2019t amazinly bad, far from it, Ozzy is still coping to a point. But he clearly struggles with the high notes. Everyone else is killing it, Randy Rhoads especially. Now let\u2019s move on to the Jake E Lee Era where we\u2019ll look at shot in the dark\u2026 Original (1986):  Now take a look at a live version from 1986 Warning: Audio is only on the left side, and volume is quite low, you get a relatively decent idea though (audio is also out of sync with the video)  Sounds pretty great, dare I say an improvement over previous live work. Zakk Wylde Era #1 Now let\u2019s take a live version from 1989:  You\u2019ll notice things start to dip a bit. Ozzy\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t quite as good as they were. Needless pinch harmonics from Zakk, but bearable\u2026 Now to 1993:  Zakk\u2019s tone has started to become more \u2018digital\u2019, less natural. The guitar sounds like random noise at time. Ozzy didn\u2019t do too bad. So now we move on to the Gus G Era  With Gus G, we see an improvement. The tone has become a bit more \u2018natural\u2019, and Gus isn\u2019t pissing his own style all over a song, or if he is, it\u2019s tasteful\u2026 Again, Ozzy doesn\u2019t seem to be too bad, but by this point, even someone who doesn\u2019t have an ear for music should quite easily be able to detect that they\u2019ve dropped the key to cater to Ozzy\u2019s voice, his voice hasn\u2019t aged well. I wont bother with more recent examples with Zakk back in the band, it\u2019s just more pinch harmonics and an even more \u2018digital\u2019 tone that sounds like garbage compared to what his tone use to be. That doesn\u2019t seem that bad right? If anything, the band aged relatively well\u2026 I present to you this monstrosity that is supposed to represent Crazy Train, courtesy of Zakk Wylde.  Poor guitar tone, pinch harmonics all over the place. Just no\u2026 Zakk\u2019s phenomenal in the studio making his own stuff, but he ruins the old songs with shit like this if you ask me. It\u2019s hard for any guitarist to live up to Randy Rhoads\u2019 standards, but don\u2019t start pissing useless notes all over the place because of it. In short, my gripe with the way Ozzy\u2019s band has aged isn\u2019t Ozzy at all. It\u2019s Zakk and his tone, the problem is that such an important part of a song, much like the vocals, has a huge effect on the overall sound. Zakk and his tone used to be good back in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t overly digital, and he wasn\u2019t pissing pinch harmonics all over the place. ",
