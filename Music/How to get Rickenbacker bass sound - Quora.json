            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve played a Rick since 1974 (not exclusively, of course). The classic Rick tone is characterized by Chris Squire or Geddy Lee. To get it, you have to play very hard with your fingers (Geddy) or with a pick (Chris). There is a good bit of distortion on the treble side but still very deep bottom bass and not much midrange. It\u2019s kind of the opposite of a Precision Bass sound, which is mainly midrange. The \u201csweet spot\u201d adjustment for the tone is to have the quieter bridge pickup at 100% and the neck pickup set to about 60\u201370% volume. All tones at full, of course. Another aspect of the \u201cRick\u201d sound is what you play - the famous Rick players were pretty melodic and played a lot of notes all over the fretboard. A final note - in my opinion, the much-discussed \u201cRick O Sound\u201d feature of Rickenbackers is complete marketing fluff. While it truly gives a separate output for each pickup, the minor differences between them do not provide any sort of compelling value when run into separate amps. You could achieve the same effect by using a Y cable and adjusting the two amps EQ a little differently. ",

            "answer_text": "There is more to the Ric Bass sound than the pickups.  Working bassists tend to hate Rics because they are kind of a monster. You can\u2019t really \u201ccurl\u201d around a Ric like you can a Jazz Bass, and they lack the thumpy tone of a P Bass. While a lot of players (myself included) who have Rics also have a Jazz bass, they are very different. Rics have really round, thick necks and flat fingerboards. They are also possessed of a slick finish on the neck that makes some players go \u201cyeech!\u201d. I love them, as weird and strangely designed as they are. But I think that the biggest thing about Rics is how they like to be played. Players who OWN the Ric sound play with a pick or HARD with their fingers, driving the pickups into the slight distortion that is the hallmark of these basses. You can get a similar sound out of other basses if you have a strong attack. I really have never played another bass that has approximated the Rickenbacker\u2019s blend of wide spacing, thick neck, low action, and flat slab surface. It\u2019s very hard to slap well on one (though some people can slap on anything), but they reward a heavy-handed approach, which not all players thrive with. ",
