            "answer_text": "I've played for over 30 years, Rush is my all time favorite band and I've spent heaven knows how much time \u201cwood-shedding\u201d Neil\u2019s drum parts so I feel particularly well-qualified to step outside my established Quora corridor of expertise in answering this question. For starters, Neil never reached a \u201cprime\u201d per se in that he constantly improved/evolved as a drummer. I think one can, however, define a \u201cvintage\u201d Peart era (more below). Secondly, there were and are many drummers with technical skills equal to or surpassing Neil\u2019s; you can walk into Berklee, Pasic festival or Drummers Collective and find them. There IS a vintage Peart era, which I would define as anything he played prior to Signals although that's debatable. What made Neil great was a combination of distinctive style, drum part composition and technical approach to rock drumming that was well ahead of its time for the genre. He tended to compose fills that underwent a progression in complexity throughout a specific song. He also used techniques such as \u201c\"implied metric modulation\u201d to give passages a driving, energetic feel during choruses. Like all great drummer innovators, he was adept at adapting specific \u201clicks\u201d and fills from other drummers to Rush\u2019s music. A famous example is his classic descending tom fill closely resembling a fill pioneered by the great Billy Cobham (note: this is called a \u201cherta\u201d). His trademark beat is a driving \u201clinear\u201d ride cymbal pattern that is common in the choruses of many early to middle era Rush songs. Neil actually went through a period of occupational angst in the mid to late 80s and was never satisfied with his capabilities from that point on. At this time, he became profoundly dissatisfied with his playing and decided to reinvent himself. Working with the late reknowned drummer and instructor Freddie Gruber, Peart switched from solely playing matched grip to traditional grip and, as the bands arrangements became simpler, Neil\u2019s playing became increasingly \u201c\"groove-oriented\u201d. Neil committed himself to playing more efficiently. To conclude, here is what I'd consider \u201cvintage\u201d Peart: please consult the discography from the mid-to-late 70s through mid-late 80s - basically from \u201c2112\u201d through \u201cHold Your Fire\u201d. To this day drummers worldwide study and draw inspiration from the drum parts from these albums. Hence, while Neil may not have been the \u201cbest\u201d drummer of all time he was certainly one of the most influential and important. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cGood\u201d and \u201cprime\u201d are difficult to answer with any art form, including music. Musicians typically get better over time as they learn more, are exposed to more and play with other musicians which all helps their craft. \u201cPrime\u201d is usually reserved for any extreme physical or mental ability, which drums are both but physical is the only one Neil is currently facing and it does affect him, he\u2019ll be the first to tell you. To answer this question you also have to factor who is the judge, as music like most things is subjective, my 15 year-old Daughter would give a different answer than me yet both points are valid, so consider the source. Drummers typically praise or trash other musicians, many times envy and jealousy come into play, so be careful if the person answering is a drummer as many would place Neil on a pedestal as God! For me what makes Neil a drummer worth studying and emulating is his playing style, which is unique and precise. He likes to build fills on top of one another, in patterns with subtle changes, or reverse parts, something you wouldn't get unless looking for it. He plays fills 2 beats into the verse or chorus, something not traditional and likes syncopated fills with harder and softer hits making up the syncopated-like sound. Neil throws triplets and flams in and is a master of cymbals and the various sounds they are capable of. Many \u201cdrummers\u201d never become \u201cmusicians\u201d, Neil has absolutely achieved that by understanding the drums, sounds, interaction with the music, etc., which all make him a better drummer. This never changed from beginning to now, so is he \u201cbetter\u201d now, absolutely in some ways! Is he also not as good, in relation to physical stamina, no doubt. Neil is certainly in the all-time \u201cbest\u201d 25 drummers and while that maybe doesn\u2019t sound definitive, consider how many drummers grew up listening to Neil as their \u201ctypical\u201d drummer to emulate, and are maybe in that same list! For that alone he\u2019s probably in the top 5 most influential drummers if not the most influential, for me a bigger honor since it\u2019s not speed alone, or complexity but HOW he plays\u2026 ",
