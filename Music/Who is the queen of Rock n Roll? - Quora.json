            "answer_text": "Unquestionably the Queen and mother of Rock is Sister Rosetta Tharpe. EVERY early rocker borrowed from her. She bridged the gap between Gospel and popular music like Jump, Swing and Blues in the 1930\u2019s. She as much as anyone including all males is on a short list of pioneers, engineers and innovators that created Rock.    Back in the 1930\u2019s she was playing her electric guitar and singing her rock gospel music. She did secular gigs with Bluesmen and Jazzmen that created the Rock sound. Listen to her songs like Rock Me(1938), Up Above My Head and Didn\u2019t it Rain and it is CLEAR that the ONLY person to be really considered the Queen and Grandmother of Rock and Roll is Sister Rosetta Tharpe. This was long before women like Pat Benatar or Stevie Nicks were even born. Sister Rosetta Tharpe helped CREATE the music. She was an ORIGINAL PIONEER in the art. The 1st woman, who preceded MOST men credited with being pioneers. \u201cShe was playing rock\u2019n\u2019roll way before anyone else,\u201d said keyboardist Lonnie Liston Smith, \u201cThat was way before Chuck Berry and all those guys. Nobody else had even come up with something like that\u201d. She herself said she played guitar BETTER than any man. Chuck Berry once said his entire career was \u201cone long Sister Rosetta Tharpe impersonation\u201d. On stage, she did an early version of Berry\u2019s duckwalk, but all you need to hear is the guitar introduction to Sister Rosetta\u2019s 1947 hit \u2018The Lord Followed Me\u2019 to recognize Chuck\u2019s musical debt to her. Little Richard called her his greatest influence and Sister Tharpe was the first to put him on stage, according to Little Richard himself in his autobiography. Elvis, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash were also all inspired by Tharpe. So was Little Walter, whose 1955 No.1 R&B hit, \u2018My Babe\u2019, owed everything to one of her biggest hits, \u2018This Train\u2019. To list charted hits as the criteria would be very narrow minded and foolish. The King or Queen of a genre isn\u2019t to be the most popular rather than the most important, most significant, most musically INFLUENTIAL! Nicks was simply a lead singer in a band that was not her own. She, Pat Benatar and all others benefited greatly from the women in the genre that came before. Nicks, Jackson, nor Benatar actually influenced the genre musically but rather played roles the male pioneers before them laid out. Sister Rosetta Tharpe influenced THOSE men and women. She was THE female pioneer and as I stated before on a very short list of TRUE innovative PIONEERS in the birth of Rock music. Big Maybelle and Big Moma Thorton would be other considerations considering their vocal styles were used by early female rockers as well as current although they were Blues artists. Blues is basically just Rock without the uptempo although some uptempo Jump Boogie Blues and Rock are identical and therefor the same. Sad that so many people who love Rock music are ignorant of Sister Rosetta Tharpe despite the fact that she is in the Rock Hall Of Fame deservedly. Don\u2019t disrespect Sister Rosetta Tharpe by discounting her achievements long before the genre was popular. She is the ONLY TRUE Queen Mother of Rock. ",

Supporting evidence:  Over forty Top 50 hits (aggregate of solos, duets,  and with Fleetwood Mac)Sold over 140 million albumsInducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 19988 Grammy Award nominations solo, 5 with Fleetwood Mac. The album Rumours sold 40 million copies worldwide, thus the sixth biggest selling studio album of all time. Her first solo album went quadruple-platinum.If this song doesn't persuade you, well...   She was so cool on American Idol (not a fan of the show but she is such a good mentor and example here):  Her lyrics are haunting:    Stand Back, everyone.   ",
