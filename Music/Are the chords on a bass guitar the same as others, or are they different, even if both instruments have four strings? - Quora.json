            "answer_text": "The correct answer is they are the same. Chords are groups of notes, and a Cmaj7 is the same 4 notes (C, E, G, B) no matter what instrument you play it on. Now if you were asking about *how to finger* the chord, then it varies between different instruments. For example, the bass guitar is tuned in 4ths, while a cello is tuned in 5ths. So the fingering, the chord shapes on the fingerboard, would necessarily be different for a bass than for a cello. But for all instruments tuned in 4ths, the chords shapes would be the same. For all instruments tuned in 5ths, the chord shapes would be the same. Chord shapes on the guitar are unique because it is not consistently tuned in a particular way: most strings are tuned in 4ths, but the difference from the G to the B string is only a major 3rd. The important take-home is that chords are uniquely defined by the notes that comprise them; how to play those notes may or may not vary from instrument to instrument depending on how the instrument is tuned and constructed.

            "answer_text": "Yes, the chords are the same on all instruments, because chords are a musical concept, separate from how they are played. Chords are three or more notes played together so they can be played on any instrument. The music theory for chords is the same for different instruments. What differs between instruments is how those notes may be played together (as well as the mechanics of playing the same note and the range and sound of the instrument). For bass guitars, the notes of chords are not usually played all together at once like a guitar or piano might play them, but, more often, one by one in a sequence to outline the chord. The bass may also primarily play the root or bass of the chords while other instruments play the higher notes of the chord. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s best to look at tunings to determine this. Four string instruments like a cello or a violin are tuned in fifths while a bass guitar is the same as the lowest four strings on a guitar, which is in fourths. Chord shapes and scale patterns do not translate between a bass guitar and a cello. It\u2019s important to remember that the music theory remains the same. The same notes build the same chords, where to play thoes notes and how to get to the next one between two strings is what\u2019s different. ",

            "answer_text": "Chords are made up of the same notes regardless of instrument. Not all instruments can voice chord tones simultaneously, like a guitar, piano, or harp; however, all instruments can arrpegiate (play the chord notes one at a time.) The fingering pattern to \"voice\" a chord would differ, depending on the tuning, on different string instruments. I've found it helpful to learn the note composition (spellings) of chords as well as fingerings. This helps greatly in arrpegiating or creating alternate voicings on the guitar or bass. On a bass, your ear will guide you as to what voicings work. (Many don't, in the lower octave.) Take away: learn chord spellings as well as finger positions. Hope this helps in your learning. ",
