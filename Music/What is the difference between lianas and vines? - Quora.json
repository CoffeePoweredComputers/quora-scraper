            "answer_text": "\u2018Liana\u2019 is a type of vine. Vines are any long-stemmed plant that either climbs up on other structures or grows vertically on the ground. A liana is any vine that has soft flexible stems that get woody as the stem ages. Lianas use trees and other structures to grow up toward the light. Once established, the main stem becomes woody and provides support for the vine to continue growing up and out like a canopy. Each flexible vine eventually hardens and becomes a woody stem or branch. The Trumpet Vine is a liana. ",

            "answer_text": "The purists would like to reserve the term vines to plants of the grape family. But in general any climbing or running plants are often called vines - in this regard, lianas (a special type of climbing plants) can be considered a subset of vines. The term liana is used to describe woody climbing plants that are climbing onto trees. In short it is more a description of a style of plant growth rather than a description of a type of plant based on genera definitions. One difference would be that you can call plants that run along the ground as vines but you wouldn\u2019t call them lianas. Hope it helps. ",
