            "answer_text": "Of course there are. Ottoman Empire kept some territories in Africa for centuries. Slavery was a popular trend though it never reached to the levels and the mentality of the American slavery. Basically and popularly, Janissary army housed almost exclusively enslaved Christian boys from conquered territories (mainly the Balkans) and they could get high ranks in the fields of administration/economy/arts since they would be immediately converted to Islam. However, it was forbidden to enslave (in the meaning we use today) Muslims as well as the \"People of the Book\" (Jewish and Christian people). Therefore, Central Africa and Great Lakes Region were popular places to enslave people. Zanj: As there were restrictions on the enslavement of Muslims and \"People of the Book\" (Jews and Christians), pagan areas in Africa were a popular source of slaves. Known as the Zanj (Bantu), these slaves were mainly drawn from the African Great Lakes region as well as Central Africa. The Zanj were employed in households and in the army as slave-soldiers. Some could ascend to high rank officials but in general were inferior to European and Caucasian slaves. Today, tens of thousands of Afro Turks, the descendants of the Zanj slaves in the Ottoman Empire, continue to live in modern Turkey. Mustafa Olpak who is an Afro-Turk, founded the first officially recognised organisation of Afro Turks, the Africans' Culture and Solidarity Society (Afrikal\u0131lar K\u00fclt\u00fcr ve Dayan\u0131\u015fma Derne\u011fi) in Ayval\u0131k. Olpak claims that in modern Turkey only about 2000 African former slaves have survived and live in modern Turkey. You can find these communities in some villages or elsewhere:  \u200bThey have been named as \"Arap Bac\u0131\" (Arabic Sister - A similar figure to the woman in Tom & Jerry cartoons) in Turkish cinema, as commonly blacks have been tagged as Arabic. Here is the Afro-Turkish actress Dursune \u015eirin:  \u200bThere is also Esmeray, a famous Afro-Turkish deceased singer from 70s onwards as an example:  \u200bOr Melis S\u00f6kmen, a Turkish jazz singer who has African Turkish people in her family tree:  Other than that there are African-born people living in Turkey. One of the most prominent example is the gold-medal awarded olympic athlete Elvan Abeylegesse who was born in Ethiopia and later became a Turkish citizen:  \u200b ",
