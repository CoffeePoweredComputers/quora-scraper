            "answer_text": "In the early days of organized musical production--early Middle Ages-- the Church was where most formal music was written and performed. Before  singers learned to read music, when manuscripts were expensive and rare, they responded to hand signals. Musical conductors assigned a hand position based on where the note fit into the typical diatonic 8 note scale. Everything was essentially contructed in that we would call the key of C today. With these same 8 notes you could start an 8 note scale on any of the notes and generate a different \"mode\" that would have a different feeling to it, but there were really only two \"keys\" (C-major and A-minor) available. The first keyboards invented had 8 noted buttons (also called \"keys\", unfortunately) for an octave of the diatonic scale.  Years later, someone recognized that you could have more musical flexibility if you could find a way to add intervals (or notes) between the notes of the diatonic scale.  To preserve the layout of the original C keyboard, it was decided to add these notes not directly between the original keys, but somewhat behind them as well. To aid in visualization and preserve the tradition of the diatonic keyboard, builders of the keyboards used a different color for these new \"keys\" (sometimes called the \"accidentals\"). The oldest keyboards we have show dark wooden keys for the original layout. Later keyboards had dark main keys and light accidentals. The early inventors soon figured out that the original diatonic scale was NOT constructed of 8 equally-spaced intervals. A couple of the keyboard keys  played notes that were spaced more closely. When they tried to put the new accidentals in between each key, they found there was no \"musical space\" between a couple of the existing notes; for instance, between E and F and between B and C. That is why you will find the accidentals oddly arranged in sets of 2 and 3, instead of being uniformly inserted between each and every note on the original keyboard. Once pianos were invented and builders started covering the wooden keys with ivory, the current tradition of white keys and black accidentals was born. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the questioner is asking why don\u2019t the 12 notes go from A to L, rather than use 7 letters, and the remaining 5 notes without independent names, but relative to the naturals . Some advantages of the current system: The compressed staff notation, by fitting naturals and relatives in the same location. It allows some notes to have two names It allows the major and minor chords to have the same notation. I am sure there are other features, but I suspect that this is the system that has evolved, it works OK and would be impossible to change. ",
