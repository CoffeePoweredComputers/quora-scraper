            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if you would count them as a band, but my guess would be the now defunct studio band, The Wrecking Crew. These guys (and one girl, guitarist/bassist Carol Kayne) are the music behind just about every song you love from the 1960s and early 1970s; several hundred top 40 songs, all told. Rock and roll, R&B, country, jazz, pop\u2026if it came out of the Los Angeles music scene, chances are it was played by The Wrecking Crew.  Image A small sample of their songs includes, \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" by the Beach Boys \"Surf City\" by Jan and Dean \"Everybody Loves Somebody\u201d by Dean Martin \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" by the Righteous Brothers \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" by The Byrds \"California Dreamin'\" by the Mamas and the Papas \"Eve of Destruction\" by Barry McGuire \"I Got You Babe\" by Sonny and Cher \u201cA Taste of Honey\u201d by Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass \"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\" by Scott McKenzie \"Strangers in the Night\" by Frank Sinatra \"Up, Up and Away\" and \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\" by the Fifth Dimension \"Mrs. Robinson\" and \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" by Simon and Garfunkel \"Galveston\" and \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" by Glen Campbell \"Cracklin' Rosie\" by Neil Diamond \u2026and many, many more. A pretty diverse range of music. ",
