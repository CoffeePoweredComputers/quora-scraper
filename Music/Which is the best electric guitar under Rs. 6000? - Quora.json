Well i cannot say that you will get a best guitar under 6k but yes you can buy an average guitar with brands like givson , jixing ,kadence frontier etc. I would suggest you to raise your budget if possible and purchase a fender SA-105. It sounds magical and a perfect guitar under your budget . Just go through its specifications ones :) ",

            "answer_text": "I am afraid you will not get a good quality electric guitar for that price. You could try exploring the used guitar segment on Quikr and OLX. You may be able to find a good bargain dealing in used goods. I would highly recommend you personally inspect the product before purchase. There are a few Indian brands you might be able to get during special sales on Amazon and Bajaao. There are a couple of brands like Vault and Givson, which will come around that budget during sales. Try reading reviews before purchase for these brands. They can be reasonably good for practicing at home, but if you want to play professionally, you\u2019ll have to have a higher budget than that.
