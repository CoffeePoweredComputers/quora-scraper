            "answer_text": "Privacy. This is my main reason for using headphones. I'm quite self conscious about the music I listen to, and I'm not ready for everybody to know what I do listen to. Putting headphones in ensures that people can't listen to my music and then decide I'm childish for listening to HSM. Respect for people around you. Not everybody wants to hear what songs you listen to, especially at night when they're trying to sleep. Ignoring people. One of my favourite things to do with headphones is to put them on, pause my music and pretend that I'm listening to music. An excuse to ignore people when I want to. Alternatively, I listen to my music. ",

            "answer_text": "One is privacy; you do not disturb others. Another is that headphones can block a lot of external noise letting you listen in noisier environments. The drawback is that good speakers, properly positioned, sounds better regardless of how good your headphones. One important aspect of the sound that you cannot reproduce with headphones is stereo imaging \u2014 that aspect of the sound where the various instruments and singers sound like they are coming from particular locations as if the musicians were performing right in front of you. [It is possible to reproduce this effect with special binaural recording techniques whose result is intended to played only using headphones. I don\u2019t recall ever seeing such recordings for sale.] ",
