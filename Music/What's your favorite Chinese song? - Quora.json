            "answer_text": "I have two. I'm not majoring in Music, so I don't know any reason why they are so good, I only know I love them. \u5341\u5e74\uff08shi nian, Ten Years)  I knew Eason because of this song. And this is also my first song I learnt to sing. I'm always a tone-deaf. Since I was 6 years old, my classmates laught at my singing, I quit singing, that was not my thing. When I was a freshman in Highschool, about 7 years ago, lots of my friends wanted to hold a party for my birthday. As a poor student, I really did not know or dare to throw a party. So I refused. They probably found out why, so they said we can go Dutch, my friend would pay most of the fees. And KTV is one of the parts of my party. I was scared, I told them I was suck in singing, they said it was OK, KTV was fun! And I, as the protagonist, I also had to sing one song. I could not refuse. Then one of my friends, we call him Big Cow, said he could teach me a song. So here it is, the song was \u201c\u5341\u5e74\u201d\uff0cwe practiced it in the dormitory in the noon, actually it was fun! Even now I can still remember the details of that noon. We just sang or yelled together, released ourselves, tried to be a real me! Then in the afternoon class, my classmates told me there were two dorks sang in the whole noon, which is usually the rest time. And the second day, the whold school knew the two dorks were us. But, I did not even care! Hahah I just found out how cool I was, with my friends! And the school also just smiled to us. After graduation, we went to different cites. And I miss you guys. This song represents my youth my friendship. \u9ed8( mo, Silence)  It was at nightfall, two years ago, I was dumped by my girlfriend. Actually she has never admitted me as her boyfriend. I was so sad, I thought she was my only solemate. In the way to my dormitory, the school\u2019s broadcast played this song. My soul was shakened, the feeling was so amazing, it was like my soul trembled with the rhythm. I just sit under the broadcast to enjoy the song, everything can be OK! This song is my immature view of relationship and intimacy. I'm not saying the songs are memorable only because of the stories, in fact, without the beauty of these songs, my stories are not compelete. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a British guy who studies traditional Chinese music. I might not be the best person to ask because I didn\u2019t grow up with modern pop Chinese music, nor is it the center of my research. That being said, I do like plenty of songs and I have studied it before. Here are some of my favourite examples then. Let\u2019s start with some oldies before we get to the more recent stuff. If you\u2019re into vintage things, then it\u2019s worth knowing about Zhou Xuan, the main pop star of 30s Shanghai:  Zhou Xuan, \u82b1\u597d\u6708\u5713  Zhou Xuan, \u5929\u6daf\u6b4c\u5973  Now let\u2019s move onto things your parents will remember if they\u2019re Chinese. Throughout the 70s and 80s, Taiwan and Hong Kong dominated the music market. So here\u2019s some good old Teresa Teng (Taiwan) relaxing your soul and Alan Tam (Hong Kong).  Teresa Teng, \u751c\u871c\u871c  Alan Tam, \u611b\u7684\u6839\u6e90  Moving onto the 90s, we briefly get the rock scene, spearheaded by none other than Cui Jian. I know to people who know about Chinese music I couldn\u2019t have picked a more \u2018standard\u2019 song here, but it\u2019s a classic and I like it. There is also the great band from Hong Kong called Beyond, and the more recent rock star Wang Feng:  Cui Jian, \u4e00\u7121\u6240\u6709  Beyond, \u5149\u8f1d\u6b72\u6708  Wang Feng, \u5317\u4eac\u5317\u4eac  From the 90s onwards, Chinese popular music has kind of morphed into a general \u2018pop\u2019 sound. I guess this might be the part you\u2019ve come for, so here are some of my favourite more recent Chinese \u2018pop\u2019 songs (note that to dedicated fans many of these are a bit \u2018older\u2019, but come on, I study Chinese traditional music, anything before 100 years is still young to me haha!):  Kit Chan, \u5fc3\u52d5  Liu Xijun, \u6211\u5f88\u5feb\u6a02  Liu Xijun, \u6709\u4f60\u5728\u8eab\u908a  Leehom Wang, \u82b1\u7530\u932f  Ai Jing, \u6211\u76841997  Eason Chan, \u7121\u689d\u4ef6 And now stand up for the king of Chinese pop, Jay Chou:  Jay Chou, \u807d\u898b\u4e0b\u96e8\u7684\u8072\u97f3  Jay Chou, \u9752\u82b1\u74f7  Jay Chou, \u9f99\u5377\u98ce  Finally, whilst China\u2019s hip-hop appreciation isn\u2019t huge, there are some good examples of Chinese hip hop I would like to share:  LMF, \u570d\u5a01\u5582  LMF, 1127  Double J, It\u2019s Ok  Namewee, \u6f02\u5411\u5317\u65b9 ",
