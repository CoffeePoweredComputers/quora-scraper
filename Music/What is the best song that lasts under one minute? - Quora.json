            "answer_text": "I posted this elsewhere, but Margo Price\u2019s perfect 2016 debut album Midwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter has a beautiful interlude titled World\u2019s Greatest Loser. I still brace myself when my Spotify hits it. I\u2019m pushing beyond one minute songs, but they all feel like short interludes rather than full songs. Patti Scialfa and her haunting little Black Ladder from 2007, no doubt penned to her husband Bruce Springsteen. Speaking of, Bruce and Patti closed 1992\u2019s Human Touch album with Pony Boy \u2014 you could just cry. Lee Ann Womack opened her 2014 album The Way I\u2019m Livin\u2019 from the soul with Prelude: Fly. Patty Griffin opened 2007\u2019s Impossible Dream with You\u2019ll Remember, which segues to the rousing Stay on the Ride. Oh boy, Tori Amos and the opening to 1996\u2019s Boys for Pele, Beauty Queen which connects to Blood Roses. Allison Moorer and 2010\u2019s The Stars & I (Mama\u2019s Song). Recently, Bat for Lashes with I Do, to open The Bride. Loretta Lynn and Jack White packed a lot into the short This Old House on Van Lear Rose (2004). Solange opened A Seat at the Table with Rise. Donna Summer and Love to Love You Baby. Just seeing if you\u2019re paying attention. Laura Nyro and Labelle: I Met Him on a Sunday, and later on that same classic 1971 album (Gonna Take a Miracle) is the divine Desiree. ",
