            "answer_text": "A silver-plated Yamaha Euphonium with a gold Schilke 59 mouthpiece. I only got to play it for a few minutes. I was a high school student who ran into a professional Euphonium player. He was generous and let me give it a toot. \u2026yeah, that was amazing. The sound felt warm, sensual, and majestic. The vibration was just on. \u2026that moment taught me a ton about mouthpieces.  For the uninitiated, this is the Euphonium.  It\u2019s the Cello of the brass family\u2026compared to the sax family, it\u2019d be a tenor sax \u2014 but classier. It\u2019s kinda like a baby tuba or a giant trumpet. Same tonal range as a trombone \u2014 but, oh, so much more silky, smooth, and nowhere near so nasal sounding. (I always thought my trombone sounding like somebody\u2019s annoying uncle.) She\u2019s the confident, soft-spoken person in the party, that\u2019s often ignored, and doesn\u2019t care. But when she speaks everybody listens. She sings marvelously with an open throat. The Euphonium is by far the best sounding instrument I\u2019ve played.  \u2026Oh, the good \u2018ole days \u2014 and how I\u2019d make that pile of pipe hum and sing. Spent a good deal of my youth with arms wrapped around that thing. Ah, nostalgia\u2026 \u2026seriously. I\u2019ve been looking at that picture like it was a high school sweetheart. Oh, the music we made together\u2026 *sigh. \u2026I wonder what she\u2019s doing these days\u2026probably has some young dude with his lips all over her or something\u2026I hope she\u2019s not as dinged up as I am\u2026  But really, an instrument crafted by a skilled craftsman played by someone who\u2019s married to the instrument is just \u2014 flabbergastingly beautiful.

            "answer_text": "The well-trained, female vocal chords can envoke tears, and we all can probably agree not many might surpass that found in the real human pitch. However, I believe the most beautiful-sounding actual made musical instrument is \u2018the harp\u2019. The long, fading resonances found in this instrument are not only mesmorizing; They are beautiful. If I didn\u2019t choose the harp for those reasons alone, then I also chose it because in my experience seeing a well-played harp is fairly rare. I\u2019ve only seen and heard them played live maybe three or four times, and mostly at expensive orchestrated events. Honestly, each time I heard it played in the right setting, it was easy to fade away into the sound. My first live experience included dual harpists playing both individually and together. Watching their fingers I thought, \u201cthis just really breeches impossibility\u201d. It also seems, amusingly, most of the time I\u2019ve only seen them played by longhaired angelic women (like they were handpicked or predestined from the time they were cherubs or something)! To me, there are few comparisons found to both the complexity in this instrument, and the pure tones it creates. One must really \u201ctake it in\u201d if ever they get the chance. It is truly a difficult instrument. I have loads of respect for anyone who can play it\u2026 Takes a lifetime. The harp is really \u201con the next level\u201d. Beauty is very rare, and a well made harp in tune is even rarer. I don\u2019t even see them in our supposed high-end music stores, more or less know where to find a good harpist - They are even rarer. So, the harp has got to be #1 in my book. ",
