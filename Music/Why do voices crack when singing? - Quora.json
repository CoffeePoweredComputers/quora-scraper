            "answer_text": "There are several factors that can contribute to cracking or breaking. Here are the most common reasons. Incorrect resonance placement - resonance not in its proper area of the mouth to make the note \u201cresonate\u201d or ring properly.Not enough breath compression (support) to create a strong note. This results in the voice losing its \u201chold\u201d on the note and the vocal cords either break apart or \u201ccrack\u201d (partially breaking)Too much muscle tension in the neck resulting in a \u201cstrangled\u201d or choked sound.Attempting to sing a note your voice is not trained to sing (outside your current vocal range). Extending vocal range is a slow, step-by-step process because the voice needs to learn flexibility and \u201crelease\u201d of tension.Too much vocal cord compression and not enough diaphragmatic compression (\u201cgrip\u201d) from the body. This creates a choked sound and the note simply can\u2019t be created.THE MOST COMMON CAUSE is the switch from the posterior muscles of the voice to the anterior muscles hasn\u2019t been trained properly so there is a gradual change of these muscles groups from lower resonance to upper resonance. I know this sounds complicated, but its not in practice. This is often referred to as \u201cswitching registers\u201d (which is really bad terminology because there are no such things as vocal registers)",

            "answer_text": "Oh that crack! That nasty crack\u2026or is it? Well, there is a good reason for that crack. There are a number of factors, but the biggest being a lack or coordination between the muscles that control the lower part of your voice (TA muscles) and those that control the higher part of your voice (CT muscles). A good vocal coach can give you exercises that can strengthen both muscles separately and their coordinated hand off. Many singers have a default to one or the other and often times need to work on strengthening the weaker muscle before working on coordinating the hand off. But then there\u2019s the other side of that coin\u2026the break that\u2019s actually wanted. Yep, there are many styles of music that actually incorporate that break. Yodeling anyone? Yes, the yodel is utilizing that break to it\u2019s fullest. You\u2019re most likely familiar with the music of the alps, but you can hear this yodel in today\u2019s pop music. In fact, I made video on how to actually achieve what I\u2019ve dubbed the Pop Yodel with one of my students. Check it out:  If you\u2019d like to find out how to smooth that break and/or use it to your advantage, feel free to reach out to me on my site and we can schedule some time to chat: This is more than a voice lesson ",
