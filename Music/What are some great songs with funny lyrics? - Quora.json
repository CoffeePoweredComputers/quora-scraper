            "answer_text": "Bruce's Philosophers Song or Bruce\u2019s Song was written by Monty Python member Eric Idle. It takes a very serious subject, philosophers, and then makes the silliest rhymes to their names. It contains a few puns on the writings of these philosophers too: the free will of J. S. Mill is mentioned, and Descartes is paraphrased: \u201cI drink, therefore I am.\u201d  There's a Hole in My Bucket is an old children\u2019s song about a vicious circle. Henry asks Liza for advice about the problem metioned in the title. After a long dialogue with a string of partial solution they get back to the original problem. Harry Belafonte and Odetta recorded this in 1961.  Itsy, Bitsy, Teenie, Weenie, Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini is a novelty song about a girl who\u2019s shy to be seen in her bikini. It was written by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss, and became a hit for Brian Hyland in 1960.  We\u2019re Going to Hang Out the Washing on the Siegfried Line is a comical propaganda song from 1939.

It was written by Prince Partridge, a blues musician in the forties and fifties. The best known version was recorded by Dr. John in 1992.  Anything You Can Do was written by Irving Berlin for the musical Annie Get Your Gun. Sharpshooter Annie Oakley is trying to convince her rival marksman Frank Butler that a woman can do anything a man can - and better. Betty Hutton and Howard Keel sing it in the 1950 film version.  All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth is a parody on the often cheesy Christmas songs they bombard us with every December. It was written in 1944 by Donald Yetter Gardner, a music teacher who noticed most of his pupils had at least one front tooth missing. It was recorded by Spike Jones in 1947.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah, so a friend of mine came to visit me a few weeks ago and revealed something funny about one of my favorite jam out songs\u2014\u201cMy Type\u201d by Saint Motel\u2014that I didn't know.  Apparently I hadn't been listening to the chorus close enough while I jammed. We were riding downtown and she goes, \u201cThat chorus makes me laugh every time!\u201d When I asked her why, she told me what they were singing. You-you-you're just my type Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing You-you-you're just my type Ooh, I think it's time that we get leaving You-you-you're just my type You\u2019re just my type\u2026you've got a pulse and you are breathing I was getting so lost in the beat I was missing the best part!
