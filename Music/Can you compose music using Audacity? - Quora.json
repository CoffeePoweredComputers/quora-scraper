            "answer_text": "Music Composition on Audacity is more like going back in time where most of the music use to play manually with no computer involved for sound processing. In short it use to final performance recording of Music composed on paper sheets. Audacity can do two things perfectly Record and Editing with No mixing, no sound modulation, no post production fine tuning and pitch correction for vocal etc. Then, How can you compose music using Audacity? The answer is You have to play and process sound externally and record the final sound in Audacity and it is expensive, tedious and nightmare for any Audio Engineer. There are some plugins work with Audacity but not useful in composition work. Normally a simple Music composition involves minimum 4 to 8 track records. However, for professional Music composition can involve 24 to 48 track records which is very tedious task to do on Audacity. Even after recording all track audacity not support mixing and further production correction. Recording Virtual instrument require the loop back as input channel to record. It will consume the resources. There is no midi support for Audacity. Everything need to process externally and final sound generated need to record in Audacity. Other option is playing real instrument and recording it in Audacity. It will further a the cost involve and performer hiring for recording composition. Hardware required to record the composition in Audacity depends on Instruments and resources available. There is no guaranty that Analog hardware interface will support the multiple track recording or not on Audacity. It is more like trial and error for hardware selection. Hardware Requirement: Multi-channel Sound interface, Multiple Microphone, Large Studio setup for performing Artist (for playing music live in studio), Instruments, Analog sound processors (i.e, rack mounded or cabinet analog processors), External Mixture with effects.

            "answer_text": "Can one do that? Yes. Is it smart to do so? Nope. You can make music just using audacity\u2014and I know a few people who actually do/did so\u2014but doing so is also masochistic at best. Audacity is not a DAW, it is a recording tool and (destructive) audio editor\u2014and for that it is actually quite a nice and relatively easy to use app, especially for it being free software\u2014which means that what you can do with it in terms of composing is severely limited. No MIDI, no real time editing, if you want to change any of your settings you have to undo, set the new parameters and then let it render, routing is almost non-existent, using anything \u201coutside of the box\u201d is hellishly tedious, etc., and so on. Basically, it boils down to \u201cusing the right tool for the job\u201d. Audacity is good for audio editing\u2014and I use it for that quite often, being able to zoom in down to the individual sample is really useful for things like cutting a loop or getting rid of spikes in records\u2014but for composing music it is plain the wrong app. Like using a sledgehammer to get a small nail in the wall: possible, but not practical.

            "answer_text": "You very well could, and I have. However, for composing music via recording, it is not the best tool to use. Audacity is primarily an audio editor, and even today, it is mostly a destructive audio editor (destructive means edits and changes are not \u201ctoggled\u201d or able to be flexibly switched on or off). There are many other free software and digital audio workstations that are both able to record and edit, as well as provide the kind of features that enable one to compose more effectively. Garageband, LMMS, and PreSonus One come to mind. Of course that is not to say that you ahve to ditch Audacity. As I have mentioned, you could compose with it. It's just a bit more hard work. ",

If you\u2019re using Audacity for vocal producing then its perfect even for a beginner i would recommend checking out some tutorials from this linked YouTube channel. I make music myself and the videos they have have contributed to the possibility of my art and the quality. YoungHalfington ",
