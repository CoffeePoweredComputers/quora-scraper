            "answer_text": "I thought BTS is acronym for Blood Sweat and Tears Almost the same thing happened with me like Lucifer Dawn Stella said. I got introduced to Kpop through Superwoman\u2019s \u201cMy parents react to Blood Sweat and Tears By BTS\u201d video. When I first saw the video I was like \u201cVideo is interesting..song is good.. these boys are probably older than me.. what are they trying to convey through the video? .. Nah Nah I won\u2019t be going into Kpop\u201d *closes the video* After few minutes \u201cActually that song was really good..let me listen to it again\u201d So I can say, the first thing that caught me is their music. I still LOVE Blood Sweat and Tears song. I found the orange haired guy (It was J-hope, I didn\u2019t know anyone at the time) to be dancing so enthusiastically and I guessed he loves to dance (And I was right :)) And I was kinda scared of Jimin from the video and thought he must be the leader and a serious guy (If you see in the beginning when Jimin sings \u201cPi ttam nunmul\u201d he looks kinda intimidating or is it just me?). Also, I was finding difficulty to differentiate them. I was really confused at first that who is who. Eventually I started listening to BST on my phone, whenever I was in class and then I looked at the translations to understand what they were singing about and I liked it more. All this time I was like \u201cNo i won\u2019t go into Kpop.. only this song.. no more\u201d I don\u2019t know why I was like that. Thinking that it will be fine, I saw one of their videos where they were cracking jokes and goofing around, I found it so funny and started watching all the videos and MVs. I LOVED their dance!!! I was so shocked and surprised watching a group of people dancing so perfectly! They have great coordination. I had never seen that before! And BOOM! THERE I FALL INTO KPOP WORLD! I ended up showing it to my roomie and she started liking them too. We started watching them together from there on. ",

            "answer_text": "tbh I thought they were wanna-be pop stars. The first song I listened to was Dope, and that was only because my friend forced me too. I thought they were weird. That they were cringy. And I was wondering why people listened to them even if they didn\u2019t know what they were saying. And then I listened to Fire. Same reaction. Baepsae. Blood Sweat and Tears. Even I Need U. I really didn\u2019t like them. I thought they were just one of the ordinary shallow pop groups that just cared about money and not about the music like so many other \u201cmusicians\u201d were. But then I listened to their songs again. This time with subtitles. This time, listening to their music. truly listening. And at first I still didn\u2019t feel much, but I heard the emotion they were putting out. I didn\u2019t love them\u2014not not just yet\u2014and I think it was because I had only heard their title tracks. It when I heard the non-titles that I realized how dedicated these boys were to music\u2014and what a beautiful job they do at conveying it. Every song of theirs has a meaning. You just have to look deep enough to find it. Sometimes its blatantly said\u2014the savage comeback to haters\u2019 comments in Cypher 4\u2014but sometimes it's there in the lyrics, even if the music doesn\u2019t suggest it\u2014like the loneliness in Whalien 52. But the thing is, you don\u2019t need words to convey music. Even if you don\u2019t understand what their saying, you can feel it\u2014and that what music is all about I guess. And that\u2019s what changed from my first reaction of BTS. So yeah um,,, that\u2019s my life story thanks for sitting around and listening to me will update when I die sorry for leaving you in a cliff-hanger bye,,,,,,,,,,,,, ",
