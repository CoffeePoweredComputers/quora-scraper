            "answer_text": "Interesting question. I can only speculate, but I think that the grunge bands would have still achieved success at roughly the same time that they did in real life. The only difference may have been that Mother Love Bone, playing their great stadium-sized glam-rock, would already have been a huge group by that stage. Also, Pearl Jam may not have existed as a consequence. And, ironically, perhaps, MLB would have been one of the bands to suffer as a consequence of Nirvana\u2019s success, as some of the other glam-metal bands did.  ",
