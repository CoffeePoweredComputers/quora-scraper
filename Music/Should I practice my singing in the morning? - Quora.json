            "answer_text": "In my teenage years I spent 5 years going to a choir that met every Saturday morning from 7-9am. (That's dedication people.) Warming up was something that was never left out of the beginning of those rehearsals. And because of the early nature of our rehearsals the conductors of the choir were very concious about which songs they chose to sing first after the warm ups. Warming up (which is a loaded term in a way because it can refer to just physically moving the vocal muscles or to doing techniques to increase the agility and strength of those muscles and wise musicians and conductors will actively use warm ups that will model difficult passages in the music that will be practiced later.) lasted 10-20 minutes and then we would sing songs that were not too high or that we knew really well already, to continue to allow our voices to warm up.  If your questions is about wether it's possible for you to have successful practice time in the morning, the answer is yes. You just need to know how to safely warm up. If you're wondering wether it's better to practice in the morning than another time I think that really depends on the person. If you're a morning person and feel mentally active in the mornings then absolutely you should use that to your advantage and practice in the AM. I have several musician friends who love practicing or having their voice lessons in the morning. But personally I am a night owl and I tend to do my best practicing after 5pm. Do what's best for you. ",

            "answer_text": "You should. You just have to wake early morning. Morning or not - your body needs to be awake. You need to fix two points: blood circulation and muscle tension of your vocal cords. Circulation is slowed down while you sleep and only raises when you move, eat (digest), drink water etc. after you wake up. So if you need to go singing at, say, 9 am, it would be best for you to wake up at 7, have some breakfast, take a walk if possible and so on. Ever wondered why it is so easy to sing after a good jogging? Exactly. Circulation :). (Physical activity also instantly boosts your lungs and diaphragm, which also helps.) The other one is based on fact that your vocal cords harden at your sleep and need to be stretched out gently. Right after you wake up, it is good to start talking. Either to someone (if available) or just to yourself. If you feel like a freak, think of your noble goal and go on, speak to yourself :). Whatever - the only poem you ever learned in the kindergarten - just let your voice speak. After some time speaking, you can start with the singing warm-ups. The rule all professionals have confirmed to me is - try to be actively awake for 2 at least hours before you go singing. That is usually enough to let your body, including vocal cords, wake up properly. But it applies any time of the day since your body behaves the same every time it sleeps. When I was working at daily shows that started at midnight, I was waking up at 4 pm and didn't sing before 6 pm :). ",
