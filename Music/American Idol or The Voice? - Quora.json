            "answer_text": "Idol, only because it\u2019s marginally more about the CONTESTANTS and not the JUDGES, although both shows emphasize the judges too much. I pretty much zoom past any of the sob stories they all like to tell and just watch the performances. Maybe a bit of the judges\u2019 input. I hate when The Voice has \u201cBattle rounds\u201d and put two singers up against each other. Most of the time, I don\u2019t get to truly hear enough from either one to judge who \u201cwon.\u201d Then, it\u2019s all about the judges arguing about who gets to be their coach. Very boring. The Voice also cuts away from the performer too much during their performance to show shots of the audience and judges. I don\u2019t care about them, it\u2019s about the performance. ",
