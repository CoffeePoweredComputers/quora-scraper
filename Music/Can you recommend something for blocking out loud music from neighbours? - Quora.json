            "answer_text": "You should find and ask Rui Soares about this, he posted a good fun answer to something similar. Whilst you\u2019re doing that, I will tell you of one or two things that you can do. (proper answer at the bottom) BUT, you do so at your own risk. You could be starting a small war, whereby people will get hurt. These tactics are not threatening techniques, but might get you punched anyway if your neighbours are assholes. In the past, I have had noisy partymaking neighbours who would party until early morning, and not give a hoot about polite requests, or even the police. So, when they all decide to go to bed, the music comes off. You give them just enough time to get settled down, and you put your loud music on. Wunderbar. Or, as I used to do when I couldn\u2019t sleep, is go out to the yard and start cutting up steel. I have done this all day long to punish a neighbour once. Early morning brush cutter. Play with the throttle as you cut, very annoying. \u201cweee-ing, wee-ing\u2026weee-ing\u201d I saw another neighbour trip the power on the transformer once, went down there bold as brass with a pair of bolt cutters, chopped the padlock off, turned off the transformer which downed the whole hamlet until they agreed in writing to cut their crap. He held the bolt cutters all of the time. He won. Motorcyle engine, you can\u2019t listen to music, doesn\u2019t matter how loud if someone is fooling around with a motorcycle, or a chainsaw. You\u2019ll get fed up. Play louder slightly off key music at them. This is actually more disconcerting than it sounds, as it makes their music sound wierd. You can find videos and tracks on the net, where people have re-recorded music at different speed and pitch, which makes for uncomfortable listening, especially if it is the same morcel. This, though is just a turf war starting. Proper answer stuff. Now, you said \u201cblock out\u201d, the other stuff was for confrontational silliness. If you\u2019re determined to ride it out with noisy neighbours, then it will be proper earplugs, where you go and get your ears molded by a specialist, Google will give you local examples. These ear plugs are magic, personal to your ears and can, if you buy audio ones recieve bluetooth signals, so that you are not deaf, and can listen to your music in comfort. A friend of mine uses this technology on tour, he\u2019s a sound engineer. But they are not cheap. Double or triple glazed windows. Works wonders. A well placed sound reflecting garden fence, unless it is in the next floor, or room. Insulating your walls/floor that face the neighbours sound source. Sound insulation is going to be cheaper in the long run than clever hearing aids. The problem with any of the solutions is that you are a prisoner to them, because of your selfish neighbours. Is there really no way to come to an agreement with them? If other neighbours have the same problem, you could try petitioning the mayor, or (insert leader type here). I wish you luck in your research, it is very annoying to have noisy neighbours, I have been caught out myself once or twice as a \u201cnoisy neighbour\u201d, but have always caved, as is correct. If you cannot show them the errors of their ways, it can be a long expensive struggle to get some peace. I moved far enough away from local civilisation that I only have one noisy neighbour now. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, contact the government entity that regulates decibals in your neighborhood. Find out what acceptable levels are for certain hours of the daytime and what they are after 9pm. File complaints with that agency and also call the police. They will, at your request, keep your anonymity. Make enough of these calls and they will silence that guy for good by giving him a summons to appear in court or failing that, force him to move. If you live in a community complex, contact the manager or property owner, enough complaints and he will be evicted. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, CONFRONT THIS GUY YOURSELF!!! Let the authorities handle him. ",
