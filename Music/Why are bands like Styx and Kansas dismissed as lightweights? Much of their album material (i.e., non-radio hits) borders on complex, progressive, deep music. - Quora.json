They are one hell of a great band to see live. Check them out. And lots of their songs from their DeYoung days ARE complex and deep. One only has to do a deep dive into Styx to see past \u201cthe hits.\u201d Styx are a killer band. Period. And whomever is ignorant enough to even claim Kansas was not, in the past, a progressive, highly skilled band with exceptional talent and very poignant lyrics\u2026well\u2026a fool is born every minute they say. But just listen to \u201cPoint of Know Return\" or \u201cLeftoverture\" and TRY to besmirch the singular musical genius that was Kansas. You will indeed be considered a fool. Are they Yes? No. ELP? Hardly. But in the context of what they were doing at that time IN AMERICA they were most certainly \u201cprogressive.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Because complexity is nerdy. If the music requires the listener to do more than thrash around in a mosh pit or boogie on a dance-floor or thrust a fist into the air to the beat (which must be simple), that music is rejected by many rock music lovers as being inauthentic and against the very essence of rock and roll, which is supposed to be the music of the working class. The only complex rock-based music that gets the approval of macho guys is death metal, thrash metal, shredder stuff, and that is because it is to be played with a lot of speed, aggression and distortion and appreciated at a volume level guaranteed to cause permanent hearing loss. To tone down the snark for a moment, bands like Styx and Kansas play less aggressively than those bands considered to be \u201c bad-ass\u201d. They play with more finesse, use synthesizers (and in the case of Kansas, a *shudder* violin), sing with high, clear voices, and use melody and chord patterns and sometimes don\u2019t play in straight 4/4 time \u2014 darn it, I\u2019m getting snarky again. My point is, \u201cart rock\u201d (as it was called in the 70s) inserted elements of classical music into rock and roll, and in the process watered down the visceral impact of rock music, replacing the from-the-gut origins of rock with the more \u201cintellectual\u201d aesthetic of classical. Lovers of rock music didn\u2019t want Styx\u2019s peanut butter getting in their chocolate. Another band that was called \u201cnerd music\u201d by the black T-shirt crowd of hard rock and metal is Rush. Somehow the metal guys (I say guys because there is a much higher proportion of guys to gals in that crowd) dismissed Rush as being for intellectual snobs and wusses. I never considered Rush to be wimpy at all, but I\u2019m not a metal-head myself, so what do I know? I would have thought that Rush\u2019s music was aggressive enough to overcome the wimpy/nerdy/snooty objections of the hard rockers, and indeed I would consider their fans to be in a unique subset of prog rock lovers. Anyway, that\u2019s my take. ",
