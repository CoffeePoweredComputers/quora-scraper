            "answer_text": "\u201cOctaves\u201d are represented by the number next to the note, so being able to sing from A#3 to B5 is a two octave range, which is about average. \u201c#\u201d signifies the note is \u201csharp\u201d, so A# is A Sharp. Look at this piano here:  Notice that there are notes on each white key, and in-between most notes, there is a black key. Those black keys represent \u201csharp\u201d and \u201cflat\u201d notes. Basically \u201csharp\u201d and \u201cflat\u201d notes are the notes in-between most \u201cnatural\u201d notes. A# or A Sharp would be the note in-between A and B. You could also call it \u201cBb\u201d or \u201cB flat\u201c, since these notes can either be referred to as the [Lower note] Sharp, or [Higher note] flat. Also take notice of the fact that \u201cB Sharp\u201d, or \u201cE Sharp\u201d don\u2019t exist on the piano, it\u2019s a whole weird thing where the sound frequency that would theoretically \u201cB Sharp\u201d/\u201cE Sharp\u201d is actually just a \u201cC Natural\u201d/\u201cF Natural\u201d respectively, so those don\u2019t really exist in music.
