            "answer_text": "It kind of drives me crazy when I read questions like this but not because of the question as much as some of the answers. I have been a songwriter for over 40 years and people answering always want to over simplify songwriting when at times it is anything but simple. Truth is there is no easy answer to this question as any songwriter can tell you because inspiration comes from so many places and often times it does not come easily. When I write a melody often a single line my pop into my head as I\u2019m listening to the melody and I write the lyrics around that simple line. Sometimes lyrics flow out of me because I have such an emotional connection to the melody while other times I may have a great melody but am totally lost for an idea for the lyrics. I have often times rewritten the lyrics to a song 4\u20135 times to finally get it to where I am happy with it. I also have melodies I wrote several years ago and have yet to put lyrics to it. I will say it is generally easier to write lyrics about something you know well, a life experience or something you are passionate about. Sometimes when doing this I can knock out song lyrics in less than an hour. There are a few things I need to object to in one of the responses and one is don\u2019t worry about the melody and start with what you want to say. Everything flows from the melody and if you write lyrics without taking the melody into consideration you will certainly be rewriting the lyrics in order to have them fit the melody. Another thing is you need to assume who your audience is, as soon as you here the melody that is fairly apparent. Songwriting can be easy at times while other times it can be frustrating but I believe that there are lyrics for every melody written. You just have to listen to the melody and let it guide you to the lyrics. It may take awhile to get there but the melody will eventually lead you there. Take the song Yesterday for example. Paul dreamed the melody and struggled to find the lyrics to the song but eventually they came out and he wrote one on the beautiful songs I have ever heard. ",

            "answer_text": "Whenever you write, you need to move your audience. You have to assume who your audience will be first. Rock, Rap, etc. need different approaches. Start with what you want to say. Don\u2019t worry about the melody yet. Make many versions until you find one that allows the audience to fill in the blanks with their own imagination or experience. Next find a \u201chook\u201d that makes sense with the melody. Define an \u201carc\u201d to the story. Then go back and fill in the verses. Using a computer-based thesaurus look for words that add feeling to the story that fit the phrasing of the melody. Test it out. If the audience is not moved by the words, change them until they are moved. This is craftsmanship. Every now and then you can hit upon an inspiration that completes the song, but most times it\u2019s perspiration. ",
