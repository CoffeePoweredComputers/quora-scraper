            "answer_text": "KPop. It\u2019s fresh, energetic, and well-organized. The kids are all polished performers - and are getting more and more encouragement to create their own content. The entire South Korean music entertainment business reminds me forcefully of MoTown - the dancing, vocals and production levels are amazingly good :D The best songwriters money can buy, best choreographers, the best videographers and stage production designers help create KPop. Trainees are signed as young teens and train for years before their debut in a group. They also are kept in check to hopefully not act out like so many Western pop stars do. Of course what constitutes a scandal in SK is pretty minor (which is problematic). The songs are much more nuanced and interesting than the majority of Western pop music - even tho Western songwriters often compose it LOL That\u2019s because the SK music companies have higher standards, quite frankly. There\u2019s a reason KPop has swept over America lately. I also love that KPop stars show up everywhere - in dramas (my major Korean thing), variety shows, on social media - the kids can interact with their fav idols all the time :d If I\u2019d been able to do that as a teen (the Beatles were MY big group) I\u2019d have been ecstatic!!

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a professional DJ and have been for 21 years. In non covid times this would be bread & butter season but most of us have learned to adapt with streaming. DJing never changed my music tastes just made me more obsessive. There are sub/genres that don\u2019t really hit me hard but my motto is that as long as it\u2019s not legit Hate Rock (people always ask-White power or any other race power rock) or modern day pop country I have some of it and WILL listen to it. I book as a bass DJ but I really do believe all genres are connected. With some it\u2019s very obvious. With out disco there\u2019s no Dance, House or Techno. With out Gospel and Blues there is no Rock a billy, Rock n Roll, Punk or Grunge. So I might be rockin some ridonk hard bass genre like Vomitstep and I\u2019ll throw in Belinda Carlisle. I use a lot of Rock songs when playing bass genres. I\u2019m talking original tracks and not Dance Remixes. Currently I\u2019m on a huge hard and dark UK Grime kick coz I\u2019m really not feeling this auto tune mumble rap stuff the US is doing. Then I\u2019m also really feeling experimental Garage or leftfield bass groups likes Quiet Bison. Fave track by them right now is Aciai Tower. As a DJ I also see myself as a performer but I also dabble in arts. I actually have an alter ego I created for my DJing that is directly linked to my love of Glam Rock and David Bowie. Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars is always on Rotation. Along with my man Iggy Pop, bands like Love, Roxy Music, and even though his pedophelia charged pain me I still enjoy Gary Glitter. As I age DJing keeps me young as crap. I constantly have my ear to the ground listening to what\u2019s new and always looking for those tracks that are awesome but people might not know them yet. I get a lot of mail and msgs as my popularity grows. From labels offering promos to artists requesting feedback or plays during sets. My obsession with music is some times bordering on 12 step program need and it seems time becomes more and more precious. I try my best to listen to all that I can and I generally keep a pretty open mind. I know plenty of artists right now that might not be making a great track just yet, but if they stick too it and keep learning they\u2019re gonna be included in one of these types of posts eventually. You may truly not feel the music I love and I respect that. Don\u2019t speak in absolutes though. I may not like modern day pop country but who knows. Some one might drop a track that really registers. To me, music is an amazing creation. It truly shows how humans are diverse complicated creatures. In the end it\u2019s what helps me cope. It helps me vent and keep a solid frame of mind in shit show times like this. It also helps me speak when I lack a voice. So if you hear a set of mind look beyond the mere dance floor and know that I may be in a DJ booth or behind a camera lens but I\u2019m using my set as I mixtape to emote the hell outta myself and lay my soul bare for all to read. Music is a power almost beyond our control. ",
