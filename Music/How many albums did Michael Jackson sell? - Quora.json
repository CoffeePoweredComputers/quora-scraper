            "answer_text": "Chris Tucker before presenting him his AMA award in 2002, says that he has sold over a billion records worldwide. SONY has quoted him as the biggest solo artist of all time in his History album, which was released in 1995. It is possible that Michael Jackson has sold over at least 500 million records, since nearly every album he released holds some kind of record. Off The Wall is considered the highest selling disco album of all time. Thriller is the highest selling album worldwide thirty years after his release. Dangerous is the highest selling new jack swing album, History is the highest selling double disc album and History In The Mix remains the highest selling remix album. Even Invincible has sold over 13 million copies with no promotion. It is possible that he has sold a billion records but given how America constantly tries to erase his legacy, it\u2019s impossible to tell because the numbers are not legit. Some people said he has sold 400 million, others 750 million, others that he has surpassed all artists in the history of recorded music. And keep in mind that Michael was working solo and releasing albums even as a kid. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s probably the best essay written on Michael\u2019s much-hyped album sales: Did \u201cThriller\u201d Really Sell 100 Million? Did Jackson sell a billion records, or even seven hundred and fifty million? Sure, \u201cThriller\u201d sold a lot of copies, but Jackson recorded infrequently, and his later albums sold nowhere near what \u201cThriller\u201d did. We know from SoundScan figures that Jackson was selling, on average, roughly a million albums a year in the nineteen-nineties and the aughts in the U.S.\u2014and that includes greatest-hits albums, like the four-million-selling \u201cNumber Ones.\u201d That\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s not the sort of thing that adds up to a billion records over time.
