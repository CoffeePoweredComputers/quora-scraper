It did happen, back in the 1840s when Adolph Sax tried fitting a clarinet mouthpiece to a trumpet and invented the saxophone. When played softly it does sound rather like a clarinet, but it\u2019s capable of a lot more volume and brighter tone and expressive quality than the clarinet. That\u2019s partly because a sax has a conical bore so it can support all harmonics whereas a clarinet is cylindrical and produces mainly odd harmonics (there are some even harmonics due to the slight bell on the clarinet, but they\u2019re quite soft). The harder brass body enables the sax to support more high harmonics at louder volumes. Interestingly, although the sax is made of brass, it is regarded as a woodwind instrument. The conical bore incidentally means that the sax overblows at the octave, unlike the clarinet which overblows at the twelfth. This simplifies the fingering considerably. ",

At least half the sound is the way the body vibrates and metal doesn\u2019t vibrate like wood. But, in fairness\u2026 I have heard wood violins and cellos that sound worse than this\u2026  ",
