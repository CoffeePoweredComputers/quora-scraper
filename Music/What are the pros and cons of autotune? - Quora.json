            "answer_text": "Pros: - Makes a recording sound better - Doesn't artifact as much as other tuning plugins - Gives you a modern sound - Can be used on instruments like bass if they are out of tune instead of having to re-record - Can use it as a cool effect like Tpain Cons: - Artists come into the studio expecting to sound like a famous pop star even though they are horrible singers. - Artists use it as a safety net and feel they don't have to sing as good because, \"we'll just autotune it later...right?\" or \"don't worry, I'm sure you can fix that with autotune...right?\" ",
