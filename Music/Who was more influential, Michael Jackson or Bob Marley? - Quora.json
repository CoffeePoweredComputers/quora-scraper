            "answer_text": "Although MJ is more influential to the world of entertainment, Bob Marley went beyond music and entertainment with a message of peace, love and unity. Bob Marley used music as a tool for social justice and spirituality. If you read about who he is, the lyrics he wrote and what he did for Africa it goes much deeper. He wrote much more and is considered by many to be a religious saint. Once he was shot for his beliefs but he still performed the next day to bring warring politicians together for peace. He gave a voice for the third world\u2019s suffering and saw himself as a revolutionary. He helped liberate Zimbabwe. He fed thousands of people in his country. Bob was more like a Gandhi figure than an entertainment figure like Frank Sinatra or Michael Jackson. Even Obama cites Bob Marley as an influence. But that\u2019s not to say Michael Jackson isn\u2019t great. MJ is probably the greatest entertainer of all time born with incredible drive and talent. But as far as influence goes, in the whole world I would say Bob Marley. However it is sad that in our country most people only know Bob Marley by the few songs on Legend to which most think he is only a pot smoking hippy similar to the way we portray Che Guevara on a T-shirt.

            "answer_text": "I love me some Bob Marley (in fact that is my hubbies fave) MJ is probably in my top 20 he bounces around it from 1 to 10 on the reg. BM fans do not get upset, MJ put the world on their knees from abtout 79 to 90. He was the biggest name it th induastruy..While some may loverMarly he was never on the worldsie stage nor had the full cross over appeal that Jackson along with his brothers had..Just from sales alone let alon if somone just walked the steet asking people to name songs or dance moves of BOTH MJ and BM, how many peopople could recall even one BM song (maybe 1 or2 ) most people know who MJ is/was and know much more of his work and enjoyed it more world wide for close to 40 year.. MJ also infulentaced Dance in a whole know way(he became a legand after the legands he learned from), he was able to change music and how it was marketed as well he was one of the first to sell shoes, pespi, read for ET, have a clothing line, book line, not to mention a doll line >Pop stars did not do that unitl they the big time.>MJ at his peak was the definiton of hitting the big time..Every President PM Nelson Mandela want to have photo ops with him. he was a huge deal world wide for 40 years (now my love the man and musice disapperd at about 89) he want too far out there and hired the worng procudeers which flatnet his sound..MJ before Dangouers was a legand and master of the stage since he had been 14. Real talent that stewd for years until he hit us with OTw..The man was hot he seemed to almost burst into flame..Def MJ tops out BM ",
