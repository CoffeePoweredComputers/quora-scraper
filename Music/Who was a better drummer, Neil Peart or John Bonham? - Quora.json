            "answer_text": "I would confidently argue that John Bonham was overall the better drummer. Here\u2019s why: I think its a matter of what we think makes a good drummer. As far as I'm concerned it\u2019s groove and the ability to set a solid foundation. (Soloing ability is simply not quite as important). Let\u2019s look at time vs feel. you can have perfect time even at blazing tempos but still sound mechanical and have little to no \u201cgroove\u201d. Time can be trained. feel is\u2026 well\u2026 felt. Bonham utterly destroys peart in that department. his feel is sublime and he grooves insanely hard and heavy in tunes like when the levee breaks, fool in the rain and good times bad times. Peart has impeccable time but lacks groove and doesn't play in the pocket which renders his drumming inorganic mechanical and stiff. As far as sheer technique and speed go, peart is on top. He is the stronger solo drummer (Moby dick in 1970 might give him a run for his money). Neil could shell out crazy polyrhythms at rapid tempos and in tough times. but at what cost? Often I find peart ends up cluttering up the music with excessive displays of his sheer technical mastery. He is refuses to play the kit for what it is. He treats his kit like a solo guitar. Outside of solos this very often renders his playing tasteless. Bonham demonstrates impressive technique AND groove with fills and tasteful/complex rhythmic insertions that are appropriately timed and not excessive. He can also hold down a rock solid backbeat like no other rock drummer which is so key to being a great drummer. Yet he can still rock a solo. I might also mention Peart\u2019s excess of drums. A great drummer should be able to rock a groove or a solo on a basic kit. Bonham displayed more character in his playing (And furious skill) with a basic kit than peart did surrounded by drums and cymbals. for tone. Bonham takes this. His thump and heavy hitting is unmistakable. The hammer of the gods. Note the difference between heavy and loud. heavy implies powerful thundering tone AND deep groove. A drummer can be loud but not heavy. Bonham is titanic. Simply more musical than Peart because he is a thundering groove machine and had better sensibilities to feel and cohesiveness. His playing is primal, unrelenting, brutish yet incredibly tasteful. He worked with his bandmates seamlessly and musically to be the subtle but present badass of Led Zeppelin. I think peart and rush as a whole, in spite of their sheer technical mastery of their instruments, were too focused on their quest to be super technical revolutionary and complex. Because of this, they lacked a lot in overall musicality even though they had the technique. They sacrificed things like feel, space, subtlety, and tastefulness for unnecessary and deliberate flashiness. Zeppelin never sacrificed these things for the sake of technical wankery (even though they could have if they wanted to) Their talent was evident and beyond measure. They just made music that BALANCED all the key components. They played as a tight unit. Not everyone was trying to be the lead guitarist. they were each doing their part. and doing it sublimely skillfully and musically. They could be flashy without sacrificing other components of the music. Bonham\u2019s drumming was at the heart of the Led zeppelin sound who\u2019s heaviness, power and feel is unrivalled to this day. ",

            "answer_text": "At least we\u2019re comparing to relative peers, as they were only four years apart. It cracks me up when a Quora question wants to compare some 20-year-old drummer today with John Bonham. As others have pointed out, this is pretty much an \u201capples and oranges\u201d comparison, with Neil Peart being the technician and Bonham being a more feeling-oriented drummer. Looking at what each had accomplished by 1980, when Bonham died, it\u2019s nearly impossible to argue against Peart\u2019s drumming having been more developed and proficient. Although he hadn\u2019t quite yet recorded Moving Pictures, with the legendary drumming of \u201cRed Barchetta\u201d and \u201cYYZ,\u201d he\u2019d already put down some incredible performances. I honestly don\u2019t know that Bonham could\u2019ve performed some of Peart\u2019s songs \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t have bet against it either. A lot of people probably didn\u2019t see his shuffle/samba work on \u201cFool in the Rain\u201d coming. On the other hand, Neil Peart probably could\u2019ve performed anything John Bonham did \u2014 nothing jumps out as a likely exception \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t have performed it with the same feel. The French saying je ne sais quoi (zheh-neh-say-kwah) comes to mind, which literally means \u201cI don\u2019t know what,\u201d but is used to mean \u201cthat certain something I can\u2019t define.\u201d This is part of what makes Bonham so legendary, as well as a number of lesser-talented but legendary musicians. Peart never quite arrives at je ne sais quoi to me, perhaps because you can point to the things he does that add up to define his greatness. When you analyze Bonham the same way, there\u2019s still something missing. Peart is a drummer for whom the sum of his parts equal his whole. Bonham wasn\u2019t; he somehow transcended the sum of his parts. Thus, you can fairly make an argument that either drummer was better than the other, but for very different reasons. ",
