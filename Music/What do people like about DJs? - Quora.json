            "answer_text": "In order to understand the DJ phenomenon, you must also understand the way that modern music production works. Gone are the days of a band of musicians playing live in a recording studio (an oxymoron? I think not. Read on.) with their performances recorded to tape. Gone are the days of individual musicians recording their parts separately only to later have their parts recombined via multitrack with that of the vocalist or vocalists. Gone are the days, indeed (for the most part) of musicians. Gone are the days when the vocalist(s) need even be on the same continent as the producer creating the rest of the track. Gone are the days (for the most part) where a vocalist need have much talent (though many still do). Gone are the days of the large mixing console, recording booths, multiple takes, and \u201calbums\". Gone are the days of the big record companies, big labels, \u201crecord deals\u201d, \u201crecording contracts\", sold-out arenas, big record tours\u2026 \u2026.and live performances (save for one exception, perhaps). That's it. They're all gone. \u201cBut wait!\u201d, you'll say, \u201cpeople still tour\u201d. You'll say, \u201cBig record companies still exist, big labels, bands, guitarists, drummers, tours, recording studios, concerts.\u201d . They do. But they're living relics. . The same is happening with the film production industries. The distribution models for film and cd are just dead. . Don't shed a tear, though. For just as playwrights still exist and live theater does and just as auditoriums used to be filled with human \u201cMIDI playback plugins\" (orchestral performers) who, though talented, were really the support for the composer (the \u201cproducers\" of old who would compose, conduct, and direct and train the orchestra), so has it returned today. We just have the ability to record those performances. Indeed, we can program them. And play them on any instrument we like. And yes, we can make it sound precisely as though a human is playing it\u2026 because in many ways they still are. What do you have left, then? The music, and the creator, (and the machine, and perhaps a single talented vocalist on another continent) and an address, (where the music can be gathered, hopefully with a payment of some sort) and the listener. Which is exactly what you have with DJ's in many cases. The music, the listener, the venue, and a performer. There are really two types: The \u201ctrue DJ\". The true DJ may or may not compose his own music. However, composition is not his gig. It's choosing and then tweaking the right music at the right time in the right way. He's got the entire universe of music as his palette and the digital tools and effects as his brushes\u2026 and the floor is his canvas. This is not a technical job involving locating music, putting it onto a turnstile, and fading it in and out while adjusting speed and pitch to facilitate a smooth mix. \u2026a computer can do that\u2026 \u2026 what the DJ does is something that only a human can do. The DJ observes the crowd. He divines the mood of the room. He senses the pulse of the dancers\u2026and selects and tweaks the tracks in real time either in response to what the crowd is (unconsciously) telling him\u2026 and in response to where he is taking them. Because he's there to take them on a journey. He's there to tell them a story that he, the individual dancing, and the other attendees are collectively participants in- along with the music. They're taking part in a ritual as ancient as the human communal are. Starting with the days when tribes of early man pounded onto drums, chanted and sang and defied the fear of the dark, near the glow of the fire, and danced and loved to the point of collective hypnosis, unified expression of ecstasy, trance. A group expression of common experience, hope, love, joy, and life. To anyone who thinks that this is some hipster bullshit. I defy you to remove your \u201cTrump for president\" sticker, and attend an event of my choosing. Stay the whole time\u2026 regardless of your age \u2026 and then come back and tell me that I'm embellishing. . The second kind of DJ came into this role as a result of the rapid changes to the music industry. He composes and produces music largely on his own (perhaps with the occasional vocalist). He largely markets his music on his own, perhaps works with a single manager who assists, and when he finishes a track, he announces it, he hypes it, he builds excitement for it, and he releases it (pulls the trigger on the contractual right for digital distributors to begin selling it)\u2026 and\u2026. \u2026.within minutes it's up on the bit torrents being downloaded for free. \u2026 and his royalties from actual sales of this track trickle in to the tune of tens or hundreds of dollars per month. A successful single might earn him $3,000 over its lifetime. It's not a living. Even if he produces a dozen tracks every year\u2026 because not all are hits and he, too, has marketing expenses and production costs, and a vocalist to pay often. But there is his track being played globally and millions of people have listened to it. Hitting the road, then, to DJ is the only way to monetize his content\u2026 and his fans seem to intuitively understand this. Here, he can earn $2,000 to $10,000 per night while playing his and a lot of others\u2019 music. He may not get the whole \u201ccollective musical journey\" thing that the real DJ'S do. At least not initially. \u2026 and he may not be as skilled as they are. He may not ever be as skilled as they are. But his fans seem to intuitively understand. And they still come. . So, why doesn't he perform his music live? The question is: which part? He's created songs with 30 or 40 parts all being played simultaneously\u2026 and in many cases he's not even played those, he's merely programmed them. No. The closest he'll ever get to playing his tracks live will be playing the recorded instrumental to backup a live vocalist\u2026 IF the vocalist is sufficiently talented to be able to perform live and hit each note correctly on the first take. Vocalists are talented, though, and most can. Some will say that this applies only to EDM. But ask those from pop acts and country groups what percentage of the music played live is recorded or MIDI orchestrated\u2026 and ask yourself with pop acts how many \u201cinstrumentalists\" look oddly just like the dancers. There will always be performance, to be sure. But the DJ / composer draws a bright line between the music and the musician and reminds us that for every song, there's a composer in some form\u2026 and it's their heart that's speaking to ours when the music we hear gives us goosebumps or brings tears to our eyes. . . Make *music*. Do it with *love* . \u2026 and vice versa. ",

            "answer_text": "A DJ can play seamless music for hours straight that fits the audience like a glove, if the he/she has the talent. In a dance party setting there are benefits to a DJ over live instrumental bands: As I mentioned before, a single DJ can play consistently for hours. A live band would most certainly need breaks between songs, as well as set breaks.A DJ has access to a near unlimited amount of sounds compared to a live band, so the DJ can more closely match the current mood of a room.Not really a benefit, but in a serious dance party, barely anyone is watching the performer on the stage, rendering the showmanship of instrumental musicians inconsequential.Multiple DJs can play back to back without stopping the music.Subjectively, the best music to have a dance party to is electronic music, and DJing is one of the best techniques for \u201cperforming\u201d electronic music live. The production of electronic music and the art of DJing have evolved side by side.For me, a good DJ mix isn\u2019t just perfect for a club, but also great for working out, reading, driving, hanging out with friends, or playing video games. The seamless one hour or two hour mix of any electronic music sub genre or gradient of sub genres is a truly great form of listening. ",
