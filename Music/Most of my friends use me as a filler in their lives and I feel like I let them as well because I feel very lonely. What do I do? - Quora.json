Finding yourself in this situation is something that many people experience. It\u2019s painful and very difficult to break free from. After all you rely on these \u201cfriends\u201d socially and without that it\u2019s easy to feel lost and confused. I have been in a similar situation where I had a lot of friends at school but I was never invited to join them after school if they didn\u2019t need me for something. Like if they were a person short for something, or if my house was free that day etc. This went on for longer than I want to admit. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t know that they were taking advantage, without them I felt like I was nothing. I felt like I would never be able to make other friends. But in the end, enough was enough. It took time but I slowly tried to distance myself from them. Sometimes saying no when they asked if I wanted to come along, trying to sit with other people from my class during lunch now and again. We continued to be friendly towards each other but with time I felt less and less reliant on them. It can be hard to make new friends, but school (if you go to school of course) can be a great opportunity. You see theses people 5 times a week for about 8 hours. If you share some mutual interests it\u2019s almost impossible to not become friends after a while. My tip to you is to take it easy. Try to find someone else to rely on and talk about this situation with. For me, one person was enough. It\u2019s how I met my best friend. You can still be with those friends if you want to but make it clear that you are in control, not their puppet. They aren\u2019t allowed to play with your emotions this way. I hope it gets better!

            "answer_text": "You should move on. Most of our lives, friends come and go. If you ask your parent\u2019s if they still keep in contact with their high school friends, your parent\u2019s will most likely say they still in contact with one or two or maybe none at all. That's because as we grow older, the path we go starts to split away from our friends, we start to know more people from college, work and other organisation. We start to spend our time with people who is simillar to ourself. Same hobbies, same environment. We no longer hang out with our high school friends. This is perfectly normal. Maybe you will be invited for gathering, that is when it's the perfect moment to catch up, if not, don't force your way to be in their lives. It's not worth it. There are many place that wants you to be there. People who are grateful of you just being there. If you still feel lonely, you are either having a wrong hobby or at a wrong environment. All the best \u2026 ",
