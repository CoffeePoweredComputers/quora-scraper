They are not thinking of dating at this time. If they are dating, we would not know. That is private. Some fans are very toxic and will go crazy if one of the guys decided to start dating. Could you imagine the harassment their partner would get? ",

            "answer_text": "We can't tell that he likes or hate her. Because there is not any proper interaction between bts or blackpink. The one and only interaction between them is between V(BTS)and jisoo(blackpink) [while mcing in an Korean award show]. So, we could say that they are more like artists from the same industry who knows each other as one of the biggest boy band and one of the most known girl group in the world. Hope it helps \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c ",
