Never ever look for easy solution if it creates another big problem in future.In life Always look for Long term decisions to make money and also to make decision rather than making a decision which shows short term gains but long term pain !In any kind of situation, never ever feel like it\u2019s over.

Like everytime Harshad Mehta come out from his problems with patience.Never ever Invest your money in stock market by lending money or by loan or by promising assured returns . Stock Market can do anything at anytime !! Better to take risk that can be digestible not like taking big risks like Harshad Mehta .Always observe everyone closely with whom you are surrounded with.Always have humble and learning attitude towards anything to learn in life.Mehta never hesitated to start learning anything at any point of time..Always say YES in life to whatever it comes, then LEARN & MASTER it !!Never think few things are impossible in life. Harshad Never ever said \u201c IMPOSSIBLE \u201c , he just started learning and then mastered .Never ever try to defeat the Stock Market .
