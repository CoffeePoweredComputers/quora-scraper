            "answer_text": "Many do, but if and how (1) professors will allow a compromise or not during for inevitable absences during one\u2019s term of promotion, and (2) what is permitted by management and the entertainment company really depends. I saw Kim Dong-Ryul (\uc804\ub78c\ud68c) on campus at Yonsei University during our freshman year just as he was promoting possibly the biggest K-pop ballad of all time (\uae30\uc5b5\uc758 \uc2b5\uc791), I often would see JYP in one of the cafeterias at school during the term of promotion of his second album (Fall 1995), and I myself was active on Inkigayo and all the big shows with Joybox while attending grad school in 2001. No doubt it was the craziest semester of my life.  And hey look, it\u2019s a former student of mine!  That\u2019s right, a number of years ago I lectured a block of classes once a week at GDU[1] (Music Department chair held by original K-pop \u201cflower boy\u201d Kim Won-Jun), and Niel from Teen Top was actually in my freshman Pop Music History class. To be sure, he wasn\u2019t there most of the time, and come finals, we had to do a proper work-around with his submitted homework and projects to make sure he was eligible to get credit for the class. All worked out. Note that schools that have celebrities enrolled really like to hype the fact that the student body in enriched with such influencers, and promotional materials and advertisements often have them featured to highlight this-and-that about a school. And much of it is quite warranted when it comes to image and personality: no lie, Park Bo-Gum was a student in one of my best friends\u2019 classes at Myongji University, [2] and the fellow is/was a proper champ, as (up to his enlistment) he would still send holiday greetings to my friend at Chuseok and Seol, even years after taking the class. All in all, there are no written rules, and everything depends on the school and one\u2019s allotted enrollment/deferment, K-pop group\u2019s term of promotion, and what a entertainment company chooses to allow for active artists under contract.

            "answer_text": "You have to be willing to be the starving artist. Jobs, University, etc., puts your K-pop band into the hobby category. They take up most of your attention and energy. You cant be half in this, half in that. You have to be full into what you're doing, or else your efforts will be too diffuse. You have to really face yourself and ask yourself what you want to be, and if you\u2019re willing to face the suffering that comes with the Artistic life. If you can work through the suffering, eventually the suffering will be a walk in the park, and suddenly you\u2019re doing great, and in the habit of permanent growth. It\u2019s a leap of faith and ruthless effort. ",

A population group will have trouble finding the time, but a group that has very little activities and popularity might not have much of an issue. ",
