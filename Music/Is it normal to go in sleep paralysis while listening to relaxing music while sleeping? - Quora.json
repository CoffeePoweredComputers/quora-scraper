Just yesterday I was having one of my post surgery restful naps, and woke towards the end. I was just lying there listening to the birds singing, the water burbling along in the river nearby and noticed that while my mind was awake, my body was still deeply alseep.I enjoyed that state for quite a while. My body seemed to be quite content to remain in it\u2019s deep state of relaxation and I used the opportunity to meditate. When I finished my meditation I thought, well, I had better get up, I needed the bathroom. In that relaxed state I moved out off my bed and headed towards the bathroom. When I went to operate the latch on the door, I realised something was wrong and took stock of the sutuation. I was having an out of body experience and there my body was, still in its state of deep relaxation! So I reconnected with my body and found myself wih my eyes open once again with my body fast asleep.Ok I thought, enough is enough and I really need that bathroom! So I began to move my fingers, waking myself up slowly from the outside in. After a couple of minutes my body had awoken, was fully oriented in the present and I was able to get up. Some doctors might consider this be a sleep disorder, however those who want to learn to have out of body experiences it is something quite normal and not to be feared. It is a tell tale sign that you achieved deep relaxation during your meditation, and by working from the outside in, like wriggling you fingers, then hands and up, you can wake yourself fully. ",
