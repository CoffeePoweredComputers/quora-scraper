            "answer_text": "Honestly, all fandoms cause fan wars but these fandoms cause the most. ATINYS vs MOAS Always fighting because they want their group to win ROTY. EXO-Ls vs ARMYs When EXO-Ls said that BTS copied their school boy concept.    When ARMYs said that EXO copied a clip from BS&T because in EXO\u2019s newest comeback, \u201cObsession\u201d a clip in the music video looked similar to Blood Sweat & Tears by BTS.   There are more examples but these are the first that came to mind. BLINKS vs ONCEs They fight a lot over who\u2019s the best girl group. Twice is one of the biggest girl groups in Korea and Japan. Blackpink has a big international fanbase as well. ARMYs vs BLINKS Stan Twitter has various examples of these. ",

Those people from multiple fandoms who said Shinee were profiting off of Jonghyun\u2019s death, for instance. How could any Shawol forgive any other fandom for saying such an awful thing. Does liking BTS or Exo more than Shinee mean that you can be so hatefully cruel to a group of boys that grew up together and were like brothers? Boys who felt the loss of one of their own so keenly? It\u2019s not about outright fan wars, it\u2019s about the fact that so many fans think it\u2019s ok to be nasty, malicious, vicious and callous in their interactions with other fandoms and in their words against other groups. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m an Exo-L. I\u2019ve seen my own fandom do and say some truly awful things, but all fandoms do it. ",
