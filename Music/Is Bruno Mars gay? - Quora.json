            "answer_text": "I just did a search, and no, he is not gay. There was a report done that said Mars admitted he was gay, but he later came out and denied it, saying they made up the story. I doubt he is, he just seems metrosexual to me. Now, why worry about someone's personal life and sexual preference? If you like him, just keep listening no matter who he loves. ",
