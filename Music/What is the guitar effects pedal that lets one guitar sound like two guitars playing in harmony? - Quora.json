            "answer_text": "Octave isn\u2019t the same as playing in harmony. The same as singing. There are Pitch Shift effects that actually harmonize. I have a rack mounted unit by TC Electronics called a G Major 2 switch features some intelligent pitch shifting effects. It takes keys and scales into consideration. The intelligence side is pretty important to me. The notes in the key of D aren\u2019t the same as those in C. TC Electronics and Boss really have this wing of effects dialed in. TC\u2019s Quintessence or Boss Harmonist have good footprints / not taking over your pedal board. Eventide makes powerful effects. On average maybe 3\u20134x more expensive and will take at least twice as much space. PitchFactor Harmonizer might be the best out there. It\u2019s more than I need. On my big board I have an Eventide H9 Max. A bit of a stomp box / multi effects unit hybrid. If you have an iPad this is what I\u2019d get. It does a lot. Stand alone or part of your system. People sometimes will complain about one patch / algorithm at a time. Not a big deal to me. Adding extra switches (aftermarket) and/or Expression pedal is a must. But this isn\u2019t a cheap setup if you go new; I got mine used. ",

            "answer_text": "My Digitech Whammy does this.  The knob selects from all the possible options, which in turn determine what the expression pedal will do. On the right of the knob are the pitch-shifting options, which run from \u2018Dive Bomb\u2019 (pedal up=regular pitch, pedal right down=3+ octaves lower) to \u20182 Oct\u2019 (pedal up=regular pitch, pedal right down=2 octaves higher.) On the left are the harmonisation options, which tbh I use far less often. As you can see, the knob enables you to select from a wide variety of possible ranges, within which the harmony can be adjusted using the expression pedal. The most conventionally useful is probably the second from the bottom, which enables you to adjust from minor to major third and so play a whole scale in parallel thirds, adjusting as you go. But I don\u2019t use the Harmony options much. They don\u2019t suit what passes for my \u2018style\u2019. I like the Whammy, though. It\u2019s always on my board. I like being able to drastically extend the range of the instrument. ",
