            "answer_text": "Almost every song by Anathema, the Neo-progressive rock band Marillion (particularly Fish period), Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, etc. But above all, I automatically think about a very great song/ballad called Longing by Helloween. It has remained underappreciated because unfortunately it is featured in one of the few average albums by this great German band. Everything is perfect in this great really emotive song, especially the orchestral part. And about the lyrics, wow! Breathtaking! You better take a look yourself, while listening to this masterpiece of course:  Longing, by Helloween, words and music by Michael Kiske Feelings come and go I've never known Something longs to grow and won't let go Spirits 'round my head are whispering I turn inside instead of wondering. Deep inside of me, I know there's got to be A different kind of truth that sets the spirit free If I don't wanna know What's written inside me How could I see anything? How could I be anything? Restless minds have searched long before The truth will be the same for evermore The mightiness of trees that you can feel Can give you all you need, just listen still. Here is love and there is pain, it's all around, it's all the same There's nothing new that I could say to you But still there is a universe inside of us that never bursts We might not know the meaning yet, but I am sure we can't reject The truth that is in everything, That is and has been and will be. There is a long way to go There is a high place to know There is a world to go through, But there's so much more to do, Until we're home! Deep inside of me, I know there's got to be A different kind of truth that sets the spirit free If I don't wanna know What's written inside me How could I see anything? How could I be anything? Feelings come and go I've never known\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Linkin Park - Waiting For The EndEspecially in Mike Sinoda\u2019s rap part \u201cWhat was left when that fire was gone? I thought it felt right but that right was wrong. All caught up in the eye of the storm And trying to figure out what it's like moving on. And I don't even know what kind of things I said My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead. So I'm picking up the pieces, now where to begin. The hardest part of ending is starting again.\u201d I never know exactly what\u2019s the meaning of the song but it\u2019s sounds beautiful and for me this one of the best song from them after In The end. Muse - MadnessTaken from their sixth studio album \u2018The 2nd Law\u2019, this song is did amazing to make me cry. I can see the song is pretty much about love and I\u2019m quoting the lyrics from the song that I think it has a beautiful lyrics \u201cAnd now, I need to know is this real love, Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had Like some kind of madness. Was taking control.\u201d \u201cAnd now I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end). And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care). But I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light). I have finally realized (Realized). I need to love. I need to love.\u201d I still listening to those songs. ",
