            "answer_text": "Ellen Degeneres makes money by getting a paycheck from her bosses (Telepictures / Warner Bros. Television Distribution), who themselves usually get money from advertisers who run commercials in between commercial breaks. As the show is syndicated and isn\u2019t on a particular network (in spite of it being mainly on running NBC-owned / affiliated stations, such as Wash. DC\u2019s channel 4 & Baltimore, MD\u2019s channel 11), advertisers might either pay the production company directly or pay the local stations money to run the commercials, as each local station might have different commercials in their set or run the same commercials in a different order from other stations).
