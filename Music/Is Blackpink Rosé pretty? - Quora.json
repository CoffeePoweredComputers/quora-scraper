            "answer_text": "Yes. She is. There are much fake Blinks that say \u2018\u2019Rose is the ugliest Blackpink\u2019s member\u2019\u2019. But it\u2019s not true! Can we just take a look at her\u2026 She is really beautiful! Here is her face \u2661  Just look at her. Her lips are cute and plump. Her eyes are small and dark. Her hair is long and soft. Her skin is clear and bright. Isn\u2019t she just really beautiful? Others may say that she is not, but i never believed that and i will never will. Everyone is pretty in their own ways and no one can change that. Now let\u2019s look at her body. \u2661  Omg, her body is just perfect! Look at her thin waist, legs, cheeks\u2026 Some people say that she is too thin or looks like a \u2018\u2019stick\u2019\u2019, but i don\u2019t think that we have to worry about this. She loves food and eats much, drinks water and workouts! She is healthy and knows how to take care of herself. My opinion about her. \u2661  Yes, she is cute, hardworking, talented, funny\u2026 But i have one thing i don\u2019t really like in her. Before i start, please remember that this is only my opinion! I\u2019m not hating on her, i actually really like Rose and i\u2019m sorry if my opinion for you seem incorrect. I think that she just poses too much. I know that all idols have to pose for photoshoots etc., but i think that she does that too often and a little too much.    And again, i\u2019m no way hating on her. I just think that sometimes she has to pose more naturally. Lifting hair, putting hands on cheeks or making resting face is not the only way to make a perfect photo. I know, i know, every idol does pose on photos, but i think that Rose looks really good when she doesn\u2019t. Your opinion can be different and it\u2019s alright. :) Some of my favorite Rosies photos. \u2661  Maybe she is posing in this photo, but it doesn\u2019t look that fake. Everything looks so beautiful here. I love it.  This photo gives me such positive, nature vibes. Her smile is just a cherry on top. I love everything in here.  Simple, yet nice photo. She looks really cute when she holds finger hearts. Her dress and hair makes it all look cozy too.  Blacks\u00e9. \ud83d\ude0d Nothing much to say, just i love this photo! So here\u2019s all i wanted to say! Sorry that i didn\u2019t add much photos. :( I still hope that you enjoyed! Have a good day. \u2661 ~Elly :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. She is actually really unique looking person. Visuals  Ros\u00e9 has these absolutely godly facial structures which are really unique but harmonize so well with each other that its kinda crazy! Her face is oval, her nose is high bridge, pink plump lips, a sharp jawline and those eyes! Surreal visuals i tell you! Her smile   Her smile is so warm just like her personality! Saw Ros\u00e9 smile to her fullest = Day made It just brings so much happiness to me to just see her smile and laugh and giggle?? She is out of this world! Words cannot explain how beautiful Roseanne Park is. Her Duality    She is not all bubbly and church girl people want her to be! Ros\u00e9 is the idol with MOST duality i have ever seen. She can be so intimidating at points that blinks say she is the last person they would like to pick a fight in BP. She pulls off this trendy sexy global IT girl vibes so well and i absolutely love her for that. Last but not the least is her passion for music, her soft heart, her god tier voice with a pinch of cuntiness which makes her different from others. Please love and support our Main Vocal and Lead Dancer, Ros\u00e9 Park. :) ",
