            "answer_text": "From my personal viewpoint, Chester had both good and bad going parallel. For example, Bennington had dream to join Stone Temple Pilots from very young age and he also achieved this later becoming their lead singer. At the same type when he was cherishing this dream in his mind, at the age of 11 his parents divorced and this incident lead him towards alcohol, drug. In an interview, Bennington revealed that he had suffered sexual abuse from an older male friend when he was seven years old. He was afraid to ask for help because he did not want people to think he was gay or lying, and the abuse continued until the age of 13. Therefore, you can imagine that this guy getting continuous predicament, had the gut to be a world class singer through Linkin Park, Dead by Sunrise, Stone Temple Pilots. Oh how stubborn he was!!! He had complicated relationships which I do not want to go into. I should say he was also devoted for his fans because in 2007 during a show in Melbourne he sustained a wrist injury while attempting to jump off a platform singing Papercut. Despite the injury, he continued to perform the entire show with a broken wrist, before heading to the emergency room.  Bennington\u2019s death happened on what would have been Chris Cornell(a close friend of Bennington, had also committed suicide by hanging two months prior)'s 53rd birthday. I imagine that Chester was a very emotional and lovely friend. In fine, Chester is that personality for whom my love for Rock genre grew up and still I listen to his songs everyday as an addiction which I can never drive away. RIP Chester :-(  Source: Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "For me, when I first heard of Chester's death, I just... couldn't understand. It's not that I didn't believe that he was dead, it's just that... I didn't. It took me a full year to come to terms with the fact that the man who picked me up when I was when I was falling, who brought me out of the dark, and who showed me that music gives me a true voice, is gone. Now that I've gone through that horrible time in my life, and looked back at what life was then, I've finally accepted that Chester is dead. Nothing can change that. But memories can keep him in our lives. Chester, I'm writing this in tears. You saved me back when I was dealing with... bad thoughts. You inspired me to pursue music for myself. Now I have a full home studio, creating music of my own, and most importantly, I'm feeling better. The future never looked brighter for me. Thank you. I know you obviously can't see this, I just wanted to empty this story somewhere. Rest easy, Chester. You have no idea how much lives, including mine, you've saved ",
