            "answer_text": "For years, the answer from a content perspective, the answer was Muzak. This is a company in its own right, but soon became shorthand for royalty free music that few people would sit down and listen to on its own. Another term used was/is \u201celevator music\u201d. The 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s bought a new challenger to the scene in the form of DMX Entertainment, a company founded in 1971 in Austin, TX. DMX provided music for not just stores, but also for Dish Network and DirecTV. In the early 2000\u2019s, DMX attempted to merge with Muzak but was stopped by the US Justice Department as this was seen to be anticompetitive. In 2012, Mood Media bought both DMX and Muzak and distributes the music to stores, malls, entertainment venues, as well as the cable and satellite TV providers in both the USA and Canada. There are some companies who use Mood as the music source, then splice in their own ads to make it sound like you're listening to \u201cThe <insert company name here>\u2019s Radio Station\u201d. As far as how it's physically played, there are speakers in the ceilings and on the walls that are used to play back the music. In the early days you could just look for the circle with the small holes in them to find the speakers. Today's speakers use the entire drop-ceiling tile as the speaker \u201ccone\u201d. I've installed all of these types of speakers when I worked with my father. The progress of speaker technology is amazing. The speakers are connected in series so that the loss of one speaker doesn't stop the sound to the rest of the building. The power comes from realatively modestly powered amplifiers, low enough power that the cables are considered low voltage. The receiver is provided by Muzak, DMX, Mood, or even just the satellite provider where the output is sent to the amplifier for output. The Internet will be the delivery method going forward, but many stores just don't have the connectivity to allow them to stream this full time. This is changing literally daily so I would expect that streaming will overtake any other delivery method very shortly. ",

            "answer_text": "It used to be that stores would connect to the radio using a form of speaker system that had a central console or PA system wired to a few speakers in the ceiling or walls, but nowadays it\u2019s either by bluetooth or via internet with a computer piping in the audio. Typically it\u2019s located out of site, in the back or on a different floor. ",
