            "answer_text": "You have to train whatever voice you have after it changes. You may not remotely be in the same vocal range as this singer. Here is a fact, not a guess. No one can tell you what your vocal range will be until it shows up. What you can do is learn to read music, and work on theory right now. Learn to sight read as a singer using the voice and range that you have now. Learn proper techniques to train your body and to protect your vocal cords or guaranteed you will never sound like Chester does at his age. Why? You won't have put in the many years of hard work that he has invested in learning his craft. Singing is partially luck with what type of equipment we get with our bodies, but mostly it's years and years of dedicated work. I sound nothing like I did as a performer at age 12 or 22 or even 32. At age 12 my choir teacher really hurt my feelings by telling me that I couldn't even audition for a part in a trio for a school musical. I had been singing multi-part harmony in a choir for more than three years at that point. She told me that I would never be a soloist either. My mother was a good singer, and she encouraged me to keep working on my skills and confidence. She actually gave me helpful notes on my singing. I needed better breath control and power. I also needed to work on my self-confidence so that I could project that to an audience with my emotions in interpreting a song in a way that touches them. The very next year we had moved to Europe, and I was offered Dorothy and the Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz. My teacher was much better, and she asked me about my goals as a singer. She made sure that I learned to sight read so that I could ace my audition for a well-known honor choir at my high school for 10th grade. I did my first professional gigs in Europe at age fourteen. It is not about learning some trick to imitate what works for another singer. The biggest stars don't sound exactly like someone else. You wouldn't be asking about Chester if he sounded like an imitation of someone else. Work on getting the skills that will make you the best version of yourself instead of a ripoff of another singer.

            "answer_text": "Hi! I'm not a professional singer, I know a little bit about vocal technique, and I developed this sort of vocal distortion (the rap parts aren't mine): Figure. 09 on Sing! Karaoke | Smule By Myself on Sing! Karaoke | Smule A Place for My Head on Sing! Karaoke | Smule Don't Stay on Sing! Karaoke | Smule Faint on Sing! Karaoke | Smule So, those are a few recordings of mine & Co., first of all, I think every single person has a unique timbre and range, I'm a light baritone (sort of), but the way I do the vocal distortion is something like this: I use head voice (sometimes falsetto, but with falsetto sounds a little windy)I mix head voice with vocal fry (but this doesn't give too much support or resonance)I compress my diaphragm a lot (pretty similar when your working on your \u201cabs\u201d)And I drink a little bit of water every song.So, a piece of advice would be, take some vocal lessons so you could know what type of voice do you have, your passagio, do proper vocal warm ups and experiment with your sounds, record yourself and evaluate your progress. I wish you the best! Kindly regards. ",

If you\u2019re looking to be able to sing like Chester whenever you want is honestly rarely if not ever going to happen since everyone has their own voice made for their body, however if you\u2019re looking to just imitate Chester then I suggest going through a process of trial and error which will be consisting of listening to his voice colour and voice rangePracticing while listening to certain songs without singing to get accustomed and prepare yourself before singingPracticing singing alongSinging by yourself (karaoke)Recording yourself to see how you soundThe reason why I said trial and error is because you will have to adjust yourself in order to improve and repeat steps in order to tweak certain aspects. Best of luck ",

            "answer_text": "for now there wont be anyone who can sing like him. People can sing his songs better but it wont have the taste like how chester sings. The thing which is unique bout him is not his scream but his voice. When he talks his voice is different from anyone. So if ur voice is not like him you wont be able to sing like him. But instead stop tryna be like him n sing ur own way. But as many years will go there will be someone who will have similar voice like him. For eg. Freddie Mercury, in his time there wasnt anyone who had similar voice like him but now theres Marc he has similar voice like Freddie. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly I wouldn't say that Chester ever really does a full on scream but rather a mixture between screaming and singing in which he can manage to actually still go from note to note while maintaining the power that comes from screaming. Basically he's only half screaming I would say. With that learn how to scream first and then figure out where you can mix the scream and still maintain tonality. Be careful though because if you do this incorrectly you can and likely will destroy your vocal chords. As for the soft singing just sing with kind of breathy. Take the feeling of sighing and then use that feeling to sing that's more or less what you want ",
