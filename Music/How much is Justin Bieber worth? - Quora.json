            "answer_text": "What do you mean by that? I think a person's value can not be calculated since different people will value him in different ways. I think his net worth can be estimated easily so I will give my opinion about the value of himself. I think he contributes significantly to the music industry so he is as valuable as his songs. Honestly, he is not my favorite celebrity so he is not that important to me, but I think people shouldn't calculate how much someone is worth because people are not objects. ",
