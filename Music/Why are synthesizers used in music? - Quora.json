            "answer_text": "Music is a complex product of composition, rhythm, melody, dynamics, and timbre and the tension between  predictablity and spontaneity.  It is also a business with budgets and schedules. Synthesizers are machines which were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of the process of making music in ways which broadened the expressive capability of the musician/composer/producer who uses them by giving them greater control of timbre, dynamics, rhythm, over the process of composition and performance  The original analog subtractive synthesizers ( Moog modular, minimoog) provided musicians like the Beatles and The Rolling Stones who were looking for new sounds with an easy means of experimenting with Timbres that could be sculpted by combining  simple waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth) with voltage controlled filters and amplifiers whose parameters could be manipulated with voltage envelopes and low frequency oscillators to vary the dynamics and harmonic content of a sound  in a manner that could be configured to sound like another musical instrument( a flute, a clarinet, a cello...) or which sound like no other musical instrument, and which provided a means to evolve the timbre as an aspect of composition or performance increasing the expressive power and improvisational capability that a musician could achieve. As designs progressed synthesizers  added the ability to sequence these parameters with an array of knobs and a timer controlled switching circuit that allowed a set of discrete pitches or parameters to iterate a sequence of steps at a variable rate.  Monophonic synthesizers that could only play one note gave way to Duophonic/Paraphonic and eventually Polyphonic architectures which could play chords, and by the late 1970s and early 1980s Multitimbral synthesizers could allow a single performer playing a single instrument to simultaneously play multiple notes from multiple  timbres selected either via stacks (linear combinations of timbres), keyboard splits ( designating different octaves for different sets of timbres), or stacks which combined different timbres, or via manipulating the velocity or aftertouch of a key press. As electronics got smaller and cheaper digital computers became a part of the architecture of the synthesizer, first as a means of storing and loading  patches for digitally controlled analog synthesizers, then as a tool for capturing and playing back performance gestures via MIDI, and later as digital replacements for the analog oscillators, filters, and envelopes in Additive, Wavetsble, Frequency Modulation (FM), and Sampling synthesis architectures.  Digital computing facilitated recording, playback, and manipulation of synthesis parameters and samples in the digital domain first via expensive proprietary workstations (e.g. The Synclavier, Fairlight CMI, Audioframe, Kurzweil) then via cheaper digital synthesizers ( made possible by lower cost memory and digital logic via process improvements ) networked together and to computers via the MIDI interface.  Workstations and applications provided all kinds of tools for songwriting and production -- cut and paste, nondestructive editing, computer assisted transposition, quantization, arpeggiation, looping, and the ability to search for, call up, and use patches, sequences, and samples from a large database. By the 1990s custom digital circuitry  So from the perspective of professional musicians, composers, and songwriters synthesizers and workstations increase expressive power and improve their workflow and productivity.

            "answer_text": "Easy: less effort > more money. For pop music, the quality and technique never have been important. Even the target audience were never giving a shit about it. (as they have no taste about music) So when somebody came up with a device, that can create similar sounds without using any acoustic instrument, it worked great for the pop music industry. Cause pop music was all business other than its artistic value. Suppose that you got a catchy melody or a nice beat, that can be a hit. What you need? you need guys to play it, work on it, make changes, alter it, for the satisfaction of investments (studios) That always affects the cost and time. But instead of getting into that whole mess, if there is a guy around, with a stupid device, that can make all those instantly, even trying out more versions from slowing or fastening the rhythm to replacing the imitated instruments with blink of an eye. Result; we got more bullshit and cheesy songs with an unnatural sound, which even have no real instruments in.. But who cares, money always comes first. PS: I hope they all suffer, whoever got involved with those. :) (I didn\u2019t even mention about techno, electronic music or dj made stuff, cause they are not even music.) ",
