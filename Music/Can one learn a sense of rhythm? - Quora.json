            "answer_text": "YES. Rhythmic acuity is a skill like any other, and anyone can develop it with good strategies. Here are a few: TAP the division of beat with fingertips (ex. 8th notes in 4/4 time). Foot tapping is not accurate so don\u2019t depend on it for learning.WALK the main beat while tapping the division of beat to get the whole body engaged. This is secondary to division tapping and feelingDo this in the early stages of learning a piece of music (listening or practicing/performing), especially the division tapping strategy.Check yourself for accuracy periodically with a metronome. However, don\u2019t depend on the metronome. You want to internalize your sense of beat/division of beat.After some time of hyper-accurate division tapping and perception, you want to allow it to fade into the background, because it\u2019s frankly mechanical and not very musically expressive. This is a later stage of becoming a good musician: accuracy + flexibility = expressivity.",

            "answer_text": "I was like that as a college music major so my school made me sign up for the African drum ensemble. It seemed really odd at first for me, but the ensemble helped me incredibly- and now I feel very strong at rhythm. So if your weak, get a drum and play along to a lot of music. The more you play, the better you will get! ",

            "answer_text": "I would advise listening to a lot of music and tapping your toes or nodding your head along with the beat, specifically listen to music with a strong pulse at first. Pop and Hip Hop (on the accessible side) are both good ways to develop rhythm. If you\u2019re into it, EDM or Metal can both be very useful as well. The best way to improve musically in any regard is to listen for it in the music you enjoy. The vast majority of music has a beat and chances are if you enjoy music in the first place you\u2019ll be able to find it. Thanks for reading. ",

I figured that it would drive him crazy, but when he brought it to his next lesson and turned it on, it was as if he had turned on a refrigerator\u2014it was completely irrelevant to how he played.
