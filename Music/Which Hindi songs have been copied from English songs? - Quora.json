            "answer_text": "On top of my head, here are some English songs with their Desi twins. Dil Mera churaya kyun(Akele hum Akele tum) - Last christmas(Wham-George Michael) The 2 broken hearted men shown below from the video clips.   Aate Jaate(Maine Pyaar Kiya) - I just called (Stevie Wonder)   It wasn\u2019t a special day or a new years day neither was there any April Rain, for Stevie to pick up and make a call. Likewise no Karvaa chauth or Holi for Salman. The Bollywood twin was just a mesmerizing title track. While we are on Maine Pyara Kiya, my neural network points another one from it. Mere Rang me(Maine Pyaar Kiya) - Final countdown (Europe)   Mafatlal product placement nightlights for Salman and pretty Bhagyasree there. Dekha ab tu(Janwar) - I wanna hold your hand(Beatles)   I'll give you a tip. Whenever you mimic the Beatles or any English rock and roll song from the 70s in Bollywood, remember to twist and shake your heads nervously, as though being electrocuted, like the climax in Hungama. Mithun da stands out from the crowd though. That reminds me. Mera dil Gaye ja, zooby zooby zooby(Dance Dance) - Modern Talking(Brother Louie)   Apna Desi version sounds better on this tune though. It can make anyboday dance, even apna Sunil Shetty.Hey, that reminds me of another one. EUREKA!!! Hello Hello bolke(Aakrosh) - Buffalo soldier(Bob Marley) Take a bow to the God of Reggae below  And enjoy Sunil Shetty\u2019s groovy moves.  I am done, bheja fried, There are so many more records to keep, but I have promises to keep and hence signing off now. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is copied my friend. It's called recreation. Copying needs hardworking too. And not every song mentioned here by many people are copied. Yes, music creators may have taken a hint or you can call them ideas to bring Hollywood quality music to India. But then again presenting it in Indian style is something which requires work. And there are some songs which may have exactly same feel but then again who doesn't copy. I heard many Hollywood songs too copying from Indian songs and artists have tried to present as its their own making. But then again good copying requires good amount of time and work. So respect the artists. And sometimes (very rare though) two artists may have same idea in their mind, and you feel like it is copied but it was original idea of both, in that case we consider first released to be original and later as copied. I watch many cover songs on YouTube too and sometimes they are much better than original ones. So if you are talented then you can masterpiece a song. I will not mention songs because I don't like it to call it copy but rather recreation. So please ask this to Google. ",
