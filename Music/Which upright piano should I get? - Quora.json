            "answer_text": "It depends on what you\u2019re looking to use it for and how much you\u2019re in the mood to spend. I\u2019m guessing that if you\u2019re asking on Quora you\u2019re not something like a performance student looking for a semi-professional instrument, or you\u2019d already have a better idea of what you\u2019re looking for than anyone here. So then it\u2019s a good idea to go to a piano store where they have used and new pianos, and try some. Once you have an idea of what is available, for what kind of a price, you can look on craigslist or similar. You\u2019ll see lots of sort-of-ok pianos for little or nothing. If you find one you like, don\u2019t even bother with it if it isn\u2019t playable. It might be fixable, it might not, but if it hasn\u2019t been kept up as an instrument that someone actually plays, you probably have better options. Something that is a good enough instrument that someone had it to play it, and kept it in playable condition, is probably a good-enough piano. Something that\u2019s been sitting around decaying because someone stopped playing it 10 years ago and now they want it out of the house, could be just about anything. If it\u2019s a really good-quality instrument, in theory, but \u2018just has two keys that stick and needs tuning\u2019, get a piano technician to assess it for you. Then it becomes a question of how much sound you want, and where you\u2019ll put it. A full-size upright might sound better than a spinet, but they\u2019re often massive, gloomy things, and you need to think about the load-bearing capacity of the floor underneath it, getting it up any stairs that might be involved, how long you\u2019re planning on staying at that location, etc. A little console piano can be much more manageable, it\u2019s two-guys-and-a-pickup-truck as opposed to professional piano movers. But at some point you have to ask if you\u2019d be better off with a decent electronic piano, that\u2019s easy to move, never needs tuning, and is fairly foolproof. I happen to like acoustic pianos, even fairly cheap ones, better than electronic pianos, but they\u2019re a lot more trouble and keep costing you money for tuning unless you put some time into learning to tune it yourself.
