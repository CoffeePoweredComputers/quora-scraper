            "answer_text": "My favorite song from Speak Now is Mine. I like how it is so relatable to real things people go through in life and in relationships such as having divorced parents, being afraid of getting into relationships as a result of having divorced parents, falling in love anyway, and occasionally getting into an argument. I like how it is similar to Love story but without the fairytale theme. Mine has a very realistic theme and can very easily resonate with many of her fans. It is written and sung in a way that can make you feel all the emotions in the song and make you feel like you are in the same situation, even if you\u2019re not. Like most of Taylor\u2019s songs, it is really powerful in that way. I also like how the relationship worked out at the end of the song despite some adversity. ",

            "answer_text": "Back To December will be my top choice because aside from I have a personal experience wherein I use it as my theme song, it\u2019s actually showing the other side of Taylor: blaming herself for a failed relationship. We all know that most of Taylor\u2019s songs are about heartaches and heartbreaks wherein she\u2019s blaming the guy for a not-so-good relationship, but Back To December is a different one. She\u2019s \u201cswallowing her pride, standing in front of him, saying she\u2019s sorry for that night. And she\u2019 ll go back to December all the time.\u201d Runner-ups: Dear John and Last Kiss ",
