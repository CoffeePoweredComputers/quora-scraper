            "answer_text": "The legend of Dylan is still alive, eh? Dylan, during 1964\u201366, was highly addicted to Speed (Amphetamine). I am sure he had tried every drug he could find, but fixated on Amphetamine during his early career. The album Blonde on Blonde is a vivid example of his Amphetamine years, and was hailed his first masterpiece. Second masterpiece was Blood on the Tracks, third was Time out of Mind. He has been through rehab too, has quit many habits, and created new ones. He did turn The Beatles on to pot, He does not seem like an alcoholic, though I\u2019m sure he knows what alcohol is\u2026 Dylan is not a drug addict, as much as he himself is a drug. ",
