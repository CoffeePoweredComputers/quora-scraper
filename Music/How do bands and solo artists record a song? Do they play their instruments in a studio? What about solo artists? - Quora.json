            "answer_text": "There\u2019s many different ways to go about this. Bands will typically play their own instruments. Keep in mind, time is MONEY. For instance, if you have a guitarist who writes all the bass guitar parts, and is able to record those parts with more confidence and in less time then the bass player themselves, then (regardless of feelings being hurt), LET THE GUITARIST PLAY THE PARTS FOR THE RECORDING. Here\u2019s why: Usually bands will pay a studio by two rates of pay: They pay hourly. This hourly rate can range from $100 to thousands of dollars depending on the caliber of the studio. In the thousand dollar range you are looking at studios that have recorded artists like Kings of Leon, the Beetles, Bruce Springsteen, etc. Usually on average for a high quality local studio you\u2019re looking at between $100 to $250 per hour.They pay per song. This rate usually applies to studios that record projects and will give you a flat rate to record a full album based on the amount of songs. This tends to be more practiced in local studios, new studios looking to establish themselves, or lower quality studios.Keep in mind that these rates are usually established by the studio engineer/producer, and not the actual studio. This is not ALWAYS the case, but usually, because the person doing the work is going to look at the investment of time they put in and figure out what the best rate for both parties. For solo artists, there is usually a partnership between themselves and the studio or producer. If they do not play any instruments, or play one instrument but not every instrument they want in the recording, then the studio will have to provide musicians. This will incur a fee either to the musician, or to the producer (if the musician is already in their payroll). If they are actually composing all the instrumentation for the song, that is going to be another fee. This would apply if the artist only has a melody and needs the instruments\u2019 parts written and recorded. ",
