            "answer_text": "I have owned a lot of amps over the years. I am also a dealer in music accessories. Please note that we do not sell these amps, so I am not endorsing and using something my shop sells. I recently have bought a couple of amps in a series (I bought one first and then bought another) and have been really impressed. The Vox AV series. http://www.voxamps.com/AVSeries These are hybrid tube and transistor amps. They are not emulators like a line 6 or other amps. They have 8 different analog amp circuits based on various amps, they don\u2019t call them what they are but they are similar to Fender, Vox AC15, Vox Ac30, Dumble, Marshall and I think an Orange ( CLEAN1, CLEAN2, CRUNCH1, CRUNCH2, OD1, OD2, H.GAIN1, H.GAIN2). I don\u2019t use the higher gain ones much - they are very heavy metal sounding. They also have very nice modulation effects - Chorus, Delay, and Reverb. I no longer use a separate chorus or reverb in my signal chain. The amp uses a 12AX7 tube pre-amp and the power amp which gives the tube overtones to the analog circuit you choose. Plus, you can bias the tubes to bright and power in both the pre-amp and post amp. It comes in 3 versions. A 15W, a 30W, and a 60W. The 60W and the 30W have 2 channels (each with the 8 analog circuits) so you can set up 2 different circuits and switch between them and 2 12AX7 tubes (pre and post). The 15W only has 1 12AX7 and 1 channel (with 8 analog circuits). I own the 60W and 15W. I use the 60W with a band and I have no problem practicing over the drums with it. The 15W I use at home for practice. Cool thing is both have headphone jack and aux in. I use the aux in at home to hook up my iPhone and practice to certain songs. The 60W has an effects loop and an external speaker out. For you, the 15W should be fine for a long time to come. It runs about $215.00 retail but I suspect, like me, you can make an offer on one for less than $200. Many dealers put these up on Reverb or Ebay as \u201copen box\u201d or make an offer. Mine was marked open box but was clearly brand new when I got it. I think I paid $189 for my 15W. By far this series was the best value I have ever seen in an amp. I\u2019ve owned several Fender, Vox, Sundown (smaller 5W) and no name amps. This AV series is super nice. ",

            "answer_text": " Yes everyone knows Marshall make fantastic amps, but for a beginner guitar amp, do you need a huge Marshall stack? Nope you don\u2019t. Get a small combo with amp modelling and effects, you\u2019ll have hours of fun playing, and it wont take up too much space in your house. You don\u2019t need anything more than 30 watts. There are some great sounding inexpensive practise amps out there, but beware, there are also some pretty awful ones that make your guitar sound \u2018synthetic\u2019. Amps I recommend include Line 6 and Roland Cube. Scroll down the list in this article to number 13 to read a review of the Cube Top 15 Must Have Guitar Accessories & Gear (For Beginners +) I actually used my little Roland 30x practice amp a few years back playing at Glastonbury on one of the smaller stages with a new artist. It sounded fantastic! Orange and Vox also do some pretty sweet sounding smaller practice amps if you don\u2019t want the bells a whistles and one sound. Check out the Vox Pathfinder. It\u2019s 10 watts, so won\u2019t annoy your neighbours. Keep rockin\u2019! ",
