            "answer_text": "My family of guitars (with my pedalboard [as of early-\u201917] and amp):  I play a variety of music including conventional singer-songwriter stuff, experimental soundscapes, rock & roll (primarily psychedelic and prog rock), ambient, shoegaze, contemporary classical, blues, country, folk, and fusions of those styles, and my equipment covers all those bases for me. Electrically, I prefer Fender guitars for most things and play a Stratocaster (\u201cAi\u201d [I also refer to her as \u201c\u9752\u3044 \u201c or \u201cBlue\u201d] , my first electric guitar [2001] - Midnight Blue with replacement pickups [Fralin Vintage Strat neck & middle single coils and Steel Poled 43 bridge single coil-sized P-90], shortened vintage-style vibrato arm, and \u2018chrome dome\u2019 knobs), Jazzmaster (\u201cNova\u201d - Sonic Blue with replacement Tortoiseshell pickguard, Warmoth Modified Mustang bridge, and \u2018witch hat\u2019 knobs), and Jaguar (\u201cOni\u201d [\u9b3c] - 3-Tone Sunburst with replacement tune-o-matic bridge). I\u2019d like to get Staytrem bridges for the Jaguar & Jazzmaster as they fix their intonation & tuning instability issues even better than Mustang or tune-o-matic bridges, and I plan on eventually replacing their pickups; I\u2019m considering Curtis Novaks, especially the JM-PAF model which is a hybrid Jazzmaster / \u201950s PAF-style pickup. For humbucking sounds, I use an ES-335 style semi-hollowbody Oscar Schmidt Delta King (\u201cJackyl\u201d - black with white binding, chrome hardware, and PAF-style humbuckers). Future upgrades for it include adding a Bigsby B7 vibrato bridge and replacing the pickups (probably with Lollar or Suhr PAF-style humbuckers) and coil-tapping them via push/pull tone pots for a wider range of tones. Acoustically, I play a 2003 Saga Blueridge steel string, model BR-40 (\u201cSenua\u201d - this photo was taken when it was new; notice how much lighter the wood is compared to the photo of it above taken 14 years later\u2026as with many well-crafted hollowbody guitars, it gets better with age as it sounds deeper and more resonant the more it\u2019s played and the sound passes through the wood). It\u2019s a D-18 style dreadnought with solid spruce top and mahogany back & sides. I\u2019ve always miked it live, but I\u2019m going to get a soundhole pickup to experiment with running it through effect pedals & amplification. I tend to prefer lower output single coils for overdriven higher gain sounds and higher output single coils & humbuckers for cleaner lower gain sounds (as paradoxical as that may seem), but it varies depending on what kind of tone I\u2019m going for.  Oni {Jaguar}, Jackyl (Delta King), and Ai (Strat)  My Fenders: Oni, Nova, and Ai I also consider effect pedals instruments and have what some might consider a fetish for them; my pedalboard changes around depending on what I\u2019m playing, but my signal chain almost always includes 2\u20134 gain pedals (mainly a ProCo Rat and Fulltone OCD), an equalizer, an analog delay for shorter echoes & oscillation, a digital delay for longer delays & glitching, a reverb, a volume pedal to fade the signal in and out (usually placed later in the chain to mute everything before it and allow the effects after it to linger), multi-effect units (currently a Zoom G3 and MS-70CDR; sadly, the Yamaha Magic Stomp in this image which I\u2019d recorded & gigged with for over ten years died on me last year) which at this point have replaced nearly all my modulation & filter pedals as well as some additional pitch- and time-based ones, and a looper for real-time overdubbing and layering.

            "answer_text": "First of all I don't want to come off as I'm bragging. I'm not. I have an addiction to guitars. There are just never enough. How many do I need? Just one more! Before I retired I was making pretty good money and bought a new guitar on an average of one a month. I have a collection of guitars that well exceeds over 100. When I reached 100 I stopped counting. I have numerous Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters. I have a Fender Mustang and a Duo Sonic and a Jazzmaster. I have a couple of Gibson Les Pauls and an SG. I also have a solid body Gibson electric that is called \u201cThe Paul\u201d I have a Gretcsh 6120 Brian Setzer model. I have a Gretsch Tennessee Rose and a Gretsch Streamliner. I also have a Gretsch Duo Jet and a Gretsch silver sparkle Electromatic. I have an original 60s Harmony Rocket and a Kay Speed Demon. I have a U.S.A. made Ibanez that I don't know the model number off the top of my head. For acoustic guitars I have a Martin D35 and a Martin Shenandoah. I have a Gibson J200 in natural wood finish. I have a couple of Gretsch dreadnaughts and a couple of Epiphone dreadnaughts. I have a Takamine acoustic/ electric and a Sigma acoustic/electric. I have some DeArmond hollow body electrics and some Oscar Schmidt hollow body electrics. I have numerous 3/4 size guitars from the 50s and 60s by Harmony and Stella. I have a National Resonator. I had a solid chrome Dean resonator but I traded it for a car. I also have a couple of Dean solid body mahohany electric guitars. I have a couple of Ibanez Artcore Hollow body guitars. I have all these wonderful and expensive guitars but the one that I play mostly is a Jasmine by Takamine dreadnaught that I found in a dumpster. I checked on Musician's Friend and this guitar retails for around a hundred bucks new. It was missing the strings and bridge but was in otherwise pretty good shape. I bought a replacement bridge and a set of strings and repaired it. I glued on the new bridge and left it clamped for over a week. It probably would have been safe to play in 24 hours but I didn't want to take any chances. It plays and sounds great! I've got a total of $13 invested in it. I don't have a case for it and have it hanging on the wall. Whenever I feel like doing a little picking, I take it down off the wall and start making music. In addition to my guitars I also have three basses. I have a Fender Jazz Bass, A Squier 5 string bass and a Gretsch short scale bass. Between all my guitars, amplifiers, PA System with microphones, stands speakers and cables I would estimate that I have well over 30 thousand dollars invested in musical equipment. I'm 71 years old and should probably sell most of them before I kick the bucket. If by chance my guitars should get stolen or damaged by flood or fire, my homeowners insurance would only pay a fraction of what they are worth. ",

            "answer_text": "I like guitars so I have more than a few. I play the ones that are working and rotate pretty frequently through them. The ones that aren\u2019t working are guitars that I\u2019m working on. I keep a few working in my living room so they\u2019re close by if I want to grab something and play. Some of those rotate. Some don\u2019t. Here is what is on deck right now.  This is a Nashville made, \u201996 Les Paul Studio Lite. I have had it for nearly twenty years. It was an extraordinary gift from my parents, is still the most expensive thing I have that I don\u2019t live in and has been the guitar I\u2019ve played the most throughout my life. It was the fourth guitar I had growing up. I didn\u2019t buy another one until 2016 actually. The Lite has balsa portions inside of the mahogany body to reduce the weight, an ebony fretboard and Gibson\u2019s 490R and 498T humbuckers. That pair of pickups gets a bit of flak. I would never change them in this thing. They sound great. Recently I noticed some significant fret wear. Part of me wants to put it in the case and stay away so it is still playable many years from now. But what is the fun in that?  The red one here is an \u201982 or \u201983 Aria Pro II ZZ Deluxe. It was from a box of parts. I don\u2019t have the original serial number and put it together with an \u201985 ZZ neck plate. The pickups and about 2/3 of the hardware are original. The tuners are pretty much shot and the bridge has to get swapped (but I\u2019m keeping the ginormous trem block!). I did the best I could to restore the fretboard but there are chips all over. I have it down tuned a step because the truss rod just doesn\u2019t have enough left at this point in its life. There is some neck pocket instability. And several cracks that go all the way through the body. Frets are sprouting right through the cracked nitro again and I just filed them back a couple months ago. Rough winter. But you know what? As long as you have an updated tetanus shot, this thing is fun to play. I have two other ZZ\u2019s in much better shape. But this one has the most personality. Then for something completely different. This is a recent addition B-stock Agile Legacy 727. It is the first Agile I bought from Rondo Music. There are definitely some problems with it but I can\u2019t complain for the price that I received it at. I\u2019ve yet to swap out the pickups (I\u2019m not a fan of the Cepheus sets). I have it down tuned a step and a half with some thicker strings so it covers a frequency range quite different from my other 6 and 7 strings and doesn\u2019t sound sloppy at all. The body just has a light oil finish. Simple. Some people don\u2019t like the beveled off tops. I like it.  Finally in the other corner of the room: the blue one is a cheap full size classical I picked up to work on finger picking. I play electric. I haven\u2019t really used most of the ringers on my right hand to do much. Ever. So I wanted something I could keep close by as a piece of workout equipment. More interestingly, on the wall behind it is an \u201983 Quest Atak I in near mint condition minus unavoidable age finish cracks. This thing is just weird. I can\u2019t say I play it that much. It has become a rather permanent wall hanging item. The pickup configuration is similar to a Tele with a humbucker in the neck. But in an offset sort of like Strat/Jazzmaster hybrid shape. The dimensions make it look \u201csmall\u201d. It is full 25.5 inch scale. It is just shaped weird. All the Ataks are. It is hard to find much information about these things. ",

            "answer_text": "I have and play two kinds of guitars The Recording King RPS-7 Parlor Guitar  I got this for my birthday back in March. It's a new model but it's based off of the Parlor Guitars of the 1930s (that you see a lot of Blues, Folk, and early Country musicians playing (I play alot of that stuff too), It sort of looks like a guitar that you would see in the wild west! I really like the old look of it! It's a Single-O or Parlor sized guitar, I like the Parlor sized guitars because their size is very nice (as compared to a Dreadnought (which I find too bulky) and can be carried around easily. The sound is also very nice (I fingerpick alot and it's really excels at it). It has a solid body and The guitar sells for about $150 and it's definitely a bang for your buck! I would recommend it as a nice acoustic guitar for starters! My other guitar is a Dobro (or a Square Neck Resonator guitar) made by Rogue (which is an import brand (but the instrument is actually pretty good for the price ($200) once you set it up):  As you can maybe see, the neck is thicker and is more square shaped (also the turners are facing up and the string action is much higher (you can\u2019t really fret it down). This is because it is a Steel Slide Guitar and is not meant for the standard way of playing guitar. It's played with a slide usually made of steel (the metal bar on the guitar in the photo is the slide I use) and is put down on your lap (or can be held with a strap) with the strings facing up (the neck is square so it's more comfortable on your lap and also it can handle heavier strings and tunings that normal roundneck guitars can't handle) There are 3 different types of resonator guitars as they have different cones and have a different sound. There is the Tricone, Biscuit, and the Spider cones. Mine is a Spider cone. the Spider cone is usually used in Country-Western and Bluegrass music and has a more nasally tone. Here's a video of my personal favorite Dobro player Pete \"Bashful Brother Oswald\" Kirby (who played for Roy Acuff and popularised the instrument in Country music) playing a solo song on the Grand Ole Opry:  I find the Dobro really fun! Ever since I heard the sound of the Steel Guitar on the soundtrack of Spongebob when I was young, I always knew I had to play Steel Guitar one day! (Despite not knowing what instrument it exactly was!) (For non-guitars I also own a Banjo (my favorite instrument), a Mandolin, a Alto Saxophone, Harmonicas, a Synthesizer (that I just got for Christmas), and I'm probably forgetting something! ;) ",

Then a VERY nice playing Gretsch, a \u201878 LP Pro Deluxe (humbucker routed so P90s long gone), and a really beautiful Gibson Johnny A. These things are like children. Can\u2019t really part with any of them. EJ Neck, (Custom) American deluxe body, EJ pickup assembly:  EJ Neck, American deluxe body, SD Lil 59 neck and Screamin Demon bridge, plays & sounds like a dream:  American deluxe neck, EJ body:  American deluxe neck, EJ body, signed (and played) by the man himself on the back bottom bout, literally the best sounding strat I\u2019ve ever played:    Two really special LP specials (the TV Yellow on is a rock monster I mean explosive mojo - something is in that thing):   A beautiful Johnny A:  A wicked \u201878 Pro Deluxe (routed for humbuckers grrrrr which i bought to reverse back to P90 but it sounds so good with these I never did):  A fantastic Indonesian Gretsch G2421 streamliner:  The first \u201cnice\u201d guitar I bought when I was 22, back in 1999, the first PRS I played that I thought was \u201cwell worth the money\u201d at $1650 on consignment after playing at least 50 of them over 5 or 6 years. Nothing special, no birds, no 10 top, but toneful sound literally leaps out of this guitar, like it can\u2019t wait to escape. My primary gigging guitar for 15 years. A real treasure and so many good memories:  And then two great PRS\u2019s that aren\u2019t quite as magical as that last one but tools fit for many purposes:   Thanks for looking!!! It\u2019s always nice to show photos of the kids! ",

            "answer_text": "I play the acoustic guitar. I currently own a Classical guitar and an Acoustic guitar. The classical looks like this, more or less:  and the acoustic (the one I play 80% of the time) looks kind of like this:   Both of them are gifts though, I didn\u2019t buy any of them myself. The first one -classical- was a gift to my father, from a family friend when we moved from Miami back to Panama. I played the Piano back then, and didn\u2019t care about the guitar, so it was left accumulating dust for years in a deposit until I decided to play it because both my Piano\u2019s broke. Anyway, I learned to play on that one until it eventually broke; or not really broke, it\u2019s more like I have to re-tune it every 30 seconds. After it broke I went to visit a family friend with my father and we stayed a while in the guys living room. He had the Black/Red one -acoustic- on a stand and I asked him if I could play it while he talked with my dad. He said \u201csure, go ahead\u201d and I went ahead. An eternity later, after he finished talking to my pops I went to put the guitar back and he said \u201cSon, you can keep it if you want to, I barely use it.\u201d And keep it I did. Ever since then I\u2019ve been rocking that red acoustic like Shawn Mendes.  Cause chicks dig guys like that, amiright?  Okay, so those two guitars were given to me purely by chance and not by my own choice. The next time I buy a guitar (or guitars), they\u2019ll be electric-acoustic, so I can plug n\u2019 play. I want a Rainsong Carbon Fiber Electric Acoustic Guitar:  Because it\u2019s beautiful (black and blue! My favorite combo) and it sounds fabulous. I also want one like this:  Because it looks a lot like wood and everyone like wood, right? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever play the electric guitar, it\u2019s not my type of instrument. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "My guitars come and go most of the time, and to be honest, I\u2019m not super sold on the idea that different woods or whatever make a guitar better. Believe what you want. And, I\u2019d take my Squiers and Epiphones and shitty knockoffs over Fenders or Gibsons any day. Anyways, these are my current guitars, my favorites of all time:  That beauty is an early 2000\u2019s/late 90\u2019s Squier Jagmaster that I recently picked up on Reverb for $200 shipped. Fucking amazing deal on an amazing guitar. It\u2019s got two humbuckers with a three way switch and 2 knobs rewired to be volume knobs for each pup. Everything else is fairly standard and works great. I love it for playing my more Nirvana inspired style, as well as some surprisingly bluesy, White Stripes like stuff when I play it through a big muff.  This is my Epiphone Les Paul Junior Singlecut. I bought it off EBay for around $200. I was looking for a guitar like what Billie Joe played on the American Idiot tour, and when I saw this, I threw every dollar in my possession at it. I fucking love this thing. There\u2019s some cheap humbucker thrown in, and it never stays in tune, yet I fucking love it. The humbucker is hot and punchy, and I actually change my tuning constantly so I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s great for playing punk, pop punk, and especially some punk blues. I can do anything that\u2019s distorted on this guitar. I don\u2019t play a lot of clean stuff, but I don\u2019t notice a difference between this and the Jagmaster. It\u2019s also great for palm muting. All around, just a great guitar. I love every guitar, but for some reason these just work to me. I love them. ",

The newer models have ultra thing necks, which I actually prefer playing over the older model to some degree.  My other guitar is an Ibanez Prestige Giger edition, from about 2006? I think\u2026 I don\u2019t remember what pick-ups came stocked in the guitar, but I liked them enough to keep them. This isn\u2019t the earlier model where they just had a painted body, this is one of the carved body guitars with the spinal column styled inlay and carved headstock.  Now that I\u2019ve been recording more I\u2019m looking into getting an ESP M-III loaded with (probably) bare Knuckle pick-ups, to vary up the guitar channels more. While many will advocate that there isn\u2019t much difference in woodtone or things like that, and that\u2019s probably true to an extent since most of your sound is driven by pick-ups anyway. I find that I prefer guitars that cost over a thousand dollars, because for me there\u2019s something about the way those guitars are built that make them far more playable and their construction is overall far better. Are there similar built cheaper guitars? Probably, I just haven\u2019t really found them, so now I prefer to save up and buy something that costs a little more. Just how I\u2019ve noticed things growing up and trying out different guitars here and there and getting into some of my personal preferences on using a guitar. However, when it comes to a beginner, do NOT waste your money on a high end guitar, it really is a waste of money and I think learning on a cheap guitar makes you a better player when you get the really nice guitars. Because if you can make junky equipment sound really good, then good equipment will just sound great! I\u2019ve always learned my instruments on cheap stuff and I think I\u2019ve become a better player for it when I could finally afford nicer quality instruments. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a few that I play, choosing just one would be like choosing a favorite child. Here\u2019s a short list of my small collection. Santana SE PRS  This one was given to me, so I honestly don\u2019t know much about it other than the retail price. Gibson Les Paul  I don\u2019t know a whole lot about this one either, other than the fact that is plays great and sounds absolutely amazing. Fender Classic Series Jazz Bass  Technically a guitar right? A bass guitar? I think it counts anyway. C shape neck, vintage style alnico jazz single coil pickups, maple neck, alder body, 20 frets. Ibanez AW54CE  This is an amazing acoustic, and it sounds fantastic. It sounds like a Martin, without the price tag. I sound like a salesman right now, but for $300 you can\u2019t beat this guitar. Mahogany top, back, neck, and sides. Rosewood bridge and fretboard, open pore natural finish. Epiphone PR-4E  This was my first guitar, and it\u2019s a pretty great starter guitar. Not much low end, and some chords (such as D) sound a little funny, but other than that, it\u2019s a pretty good first. And since I have an addiction, this is the small start to an okay collection. Thanks for Reading! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I have four right now, but I\u2019m eyeing a really nice Squire Tele that has a lovely twang and crunch\u2014and a really slick fast neck. I\u2019ll update this with some pics as soon as I can find the USB cable to upload my camera-phone pics to the computer. (No internet on my dumb Galaxy S5 smartphone. Expensive and risky) For now, you\u2019ll have to content yourself with my descriptions. (Updated 4/25/19 for pictures) 1987 Fender Japanese Stratocaster\u2014the first year they were assembled in Japan. Arctic white with a maple neck. I paid $399 with case and a Fender guitar cord. The original pickups were really wimpy and that friggin\u2019 five-position Fender switch was crackling like a cheap transistor radio, so I dropped in a set of Fender Tex-Mex pickups and a Switchcraft five-position switch earlier this year. I kept the original wiring configuration. Result: pure magic. It\u2019s LOUD and clean and twangy like SRV\u2019s. (Too bad I can\u2019t play like him.) Standard bridge and vibrato, three springs. This is my main ax. I\u2019m the original owner and I\u2019ll NEVER sell or trade it.  2013 Epiphone Les Paul Special II with the Gibson 490R and 498T design humbuckers. Cherry sunburst just like Tim Lantz\u2019s true Gibson below. Ruler straight neck, smooth and fast. Lightweight\u2014much lighter than a full-on LP Standard or Custom\u2014and quite a joy to switch from fat powerchords to screamin\u2019 leads. I paid $100 for it at a pawn shop here in Tucson. Honest.  1976 Rickenbacker 4001. Burgundy finish. Major mods: a Starz Guitars chrome-plated brass bridge with a little slot for a Strat-style pick-up that I\u2019ve never filled. No need: I use Rotosounds exclusively on her and those have all the treble I\u2019ll ever need. It helps to have a set of Bartolini custom-wound pick-ups, though. Brass nut, too. I had all the lacquer stripped from the deck of the neck and refretted with DiMarzio Jumbo Nickle frets. There\u2019s also a coil tap on the neck pick-up that I rarely use, preferring to keep my lovely beast wide open and work with the dynamics, combinations of various picks, my fingers and thumb, and occasionally a volume pedal. I\u2019ve played around with fx pedals but they all alter her color, her tonality and range. I\u2019m the original owner. I factory-ordered her and paid cash in advance: $695 with case. I was there at Showcase Music in Portland Oregon when they uncrated her. I was the first one to touch her and the first to play her outside of the factory. I\u2019ve had offers of up to $2000 for her because she sounds incredible. No, I will never sell her. My godson Jack gets her when I pass on because he\u2019s a fairly awesome bass player too.  1988 Guild JF-4 NT acoustic guitar. Satin finish. Original owner. I paid $800 with case and it was the best investment I\u2019ve ever made in an acoustic guitar. Deep rich lows, chiming highs, really fat middle. I use a Seymour Duncan in-hole pickup when I need to run her through a direct box and into the PA. (Not the guitar amp. Too harsh.) Gorgeous guitar (VG condition) and a real pleasure to compose with.  I use D\u2019Addario strings exclusively on my guitars, XL\u2019s, .010 - .046 and D\u2019Addario phosphor bronze EJ18\u20133D, .012 - .053 on my Guild. I did try a set of Ernie Ball Regular Slinkies with a .010 high E on the Guild for a while, but I didn\u2019t like the way they buzzed down in first position. Annoying. So I switched back to the heavier strings and so what if it takes a little more effort? I have a close, personal relationship with my guitars. I create with them and they all deserve my respect, both for the craftsmanship that went into their construction and for the beautiful sounds that come from them. Everybody here knows: when you\u2019re in the Zone with a fine guitar, it\u2019s better than sex. A few more pics: Some of these were taken at an annual outdoor jam called \u201cCamp Up-A-Chuck,\u201d organized and funded by my godson, Jackson Locomotivebreath Conrad-Woldrich. He\u2019s the chubby guy with the beard and the pipe, playing a weird hybrid we called the \u201cFrankenTele.\u201d It was actually a pretty nice guitar, but it had an unpleasant tendency to go out of tune in high humidity\u2014which happens a lot in Oregon. Yeah, I play keyboards too.  My current studio in Tucson, the front left corner of my apartment. (I\u2019m here at the University of Arizona, finishing my master\u2019s degree in Rhetoric, Composition, and Teaching English\u2014RCTE.) My public persona is that of a mild-mannered English teacher but when there\u2019s a call for Truth, Justice, and The American Way of Powerchords, I always respond.    ",

My first guitar I got was a beautiful looking and sounding Yamaha Acoustic. Yamaha is underrated, in my opinion, for beginner instruments. I've been told by everyone I know that this guitar sounds beautiful. The most expensive guitar I own coming in at a whopping 300$  My next guitar is my bass. This is an Ibanez bass I bought from a family member for around 150$ and it came with a nice case. This bass plays really well and I can dial in some great tones.  My last instrument is my Epiphone electric. This thing is a great beginner electric guitar. It has a great tone for playing worship music and has a nice blue hue. For only being 140 it sounds great. My only gripes with it are that the tuners aren't great and the place you plug in your cable comes loose sometimes. Other than that it's a great instrument. It's also insanely easy to setup after re-stringing it. Simply put the strings on, adjust the bridge with a screwdriver, and play.  ",

It sounds okay, but I wouldn't use if I wasn\u2019t dressed for glam rock.  My acoustic is a Yamaha APX500. Not the most expensive of guitar, but it\u2019s really good and plays like something twice the price. It\u2019s been gigged very hard.  I don\u2019t use them as much but I also have a Strat, and Gibson Sonex, which was an 80s budget guitar. That was my first ever electric, so is rather a sentimental piece.  ",

Half-scalloped fretboard, a coil-tapped pickup I wound, Gilmour switching. Great modding platform!  My first serious project - a cheap 70\u2019s Strat clone turned 5150.  Another project Strat - made from a horribly trashed body, with all three pickups wired in series. A little muddy for distortion but wonderful phat cleans.  My first kit build, a cheap 335 finished in dyes and Tru Oil. Needs a better nut and lower action, but the tone and feedback are phenomenal for overdriven stuff.  The \u201cLes Plywood\u201d - made of five layers of plywood found in the garage with a random, er, proprietary chambering arrangement. One neck pickup straight to output for max simplicity.  This was a fun project piece - another Strat rescued from an abusive former life! Vaguely Hendrix-inspired relic and reverse-angled bridge pickup. Switching is entirely unique to my knowledge - \u201cnormal\u201d mode is neck and bridge in series, like a stretched-out humbucker. \u201cTwang\u201d mode adds the middle pickup out of phase for a sharp, thin tone. Equal parts janky and durable!  The latest build - a plank and a board, a Tru-Oil neck, and a set of hardware. No weird wiring, this'un just does that Tele thing :) ",

My other is a Gibson Explorer (1977), that had some modifications made to it when I purchased it. The original pickups were already gone and had been replaced with some Dimarzio super distortions which I did not like. I replaced those with some Seymour Duncan pickups (jazz in the neck position and super humbucker in the bridge position). This gave the guitar a wide range of sound that I absolutely love. I still wish I have all the original hardware, but as I said, it was already modified when I got my hands on it so I made adjustment to get what I wanted out of it. It is still me desire to add a Fender Telecaster to the group. I am primarily a bass player though, so it is not a priority for me. ",

            "answer_text": "I play a number of different guitars depending on the requirements for the gig I'm playing. The guitar I play most is a Takamine supernatural series Cedartop rosewood sides and back electric acoustic. I love the response of a Cedartop for finger style playing. If it's an acoustic gig where I need to play harder and more rhythmically, I choose a spruce top over the Cedar for a crisper more percussive sound. if it's an electric gig, my main guitar is a 78 Strat, it's versatile enough to play just about anything. If the gig calls for a heavier rock sound I have a custom built Strat style with dual humbuckers and Gibson type wiring that feels like a Strat, but sounds like a Les Paul. As you can see, I try to cover my bases! ",

The tone is very good and it is comfortable to play.Epiphone Custom Shop Limited Edition 335 Dot. This is a version of the famous Gibson ES-335. This particular guitar has two Gibson gold cover humbuckers. It is a great electric guitar.A \u2018home made\u2019 Stratocaster style electric. This is based on a cheap Chinese kit, but I have fitted a custom neck, and some \u2018Tone Rider\u2019 pickups. This sounds like a classic Strat, I like it.I play the electrics through a Vox 35 watt tube amp, the amplifier is definitely a part of the electric guitar, its voice. The Vox is a Tony Bruno model, 2X12\u2033 speakers. Rather like a grittier Fender Twin.With these guitars I am able to play a wide range of guitar music, I would like some more guitars but these 3 do the job nicely. I\u2019d like to get a Les Paul next-this next year maybe. ",

I have one axe for every different tree  This is my Ibanez Jem jr. it plays awesome and has a lot of great sound in it.

Looks the best in the bunch. It sounds amazing since it has the dimarzio fusion pickups.  This Is my Jackson warrior (not sure shoot the model but it\u2019s one of the made in India ones). I bought it for a very low price. It\u2019s a bit worn Out and is hard to setup but it\u2019s great for being just 150$. I use it in Bb standard tuning.  This is my Epiphone les paul 100. It was my second electric guitar. It has a super sweet neck pickup and traditional sounding bridge. It\u2019s a bit harder to play because of its small scale length against my wide and fat fingers. But it\u2019s awesome nonetheless  This is the last of the bunch. It\u2019s a fender cd60ce semi acoustic. It\u2019s a great instrument and has awesome fish and pickups. I use it very less because I don\u2019t generally play acoustic songs. But it is useful when the time comes ",

I just got a PRS SE EG that will be arriving today and look forward to playing it. Also on Friday I will receive a 1985 JB Player (not really my kind of guitar) I bought it because it is one of the few neck thru model they ever made and possibly the most high end one they made, It has 2 German made pickups in the mid and neck position and a Seymour Duncan P-90 in the bridge. I also have more that are not pictured. I have too many to list and a few custom builds including one I built myself. I have built several over the years.  ",

But i bought recently the HD-28 with sitka spruce top and indian Rosewood back and sides. AWESOME!! Response is immediate and the sustain is out of the world!! My Taylors - series 200 (214ce to be exact) and the 618ce(Grand Orchestra body) sound awesome too. Taylor 618 is also with Torrified top which means it sounds almost like a vintage(if you may!) and is given the \u2018aged guitar effect\u2019. well almost that!! The Yamaha Transacoustic is also one of my possessions and the in built Amp is awesome too. But i have to use medium gauge steel strings for it to sound as i like which comprises the bends and pulloffs a lil bit. Rosewood back and sides again in Yamaha. Beautiful piece of art!! Which one I personally enjoy the most?? Well depends on the moment and the mood. Sometimes a relatively humbler Fender acoustic works wonders which the HD28 cannot at that moment!! But since i have to go a long way ahead, as tone appreciation improves, i may zero-in to one only. but i love them all-no favourites! ",
