            "answer_text": "This is another newbie question where the querent has tipped her hand that she (assuming gender from the name and photo of the person asking) knows very little, perhaps nothing at all, about jazz. She also clearly does not know much about guitar, maybe just how to finger an E major chord and a few others. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having either of those limitations. Nor does having either one preclude one\u2019s being allowed to ask a serious question about jazz chords. Let\u2019s switch to the second person, regardless of how much you know about jazz. There may be some things you don\u2019t know. This is also why a direct answer to the question isn\u2019t particularly useful. Consider these things before becoming impatient and demanding to know a bunch of specific chords to play in sequence. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Chord progressions, in general, are not discussed in terms of the specific letter names of the tones involved unless a piece set in a specific key is being cited. When speaking of chord progressions, the central concept is the set of musical intervals between the tones being discussed, not what keys on a piano keyboard are to be depressed. Most of the time, we express these tonal relationships with numbers, both for the scale degrees of individual tones (Arabic numbers) and root tones of chords (Roman numerals).On a guitar, unlike a piano, chord progressions tend to sound harmonically different depending on the specific tone used as the root tone of the first chord. (On a piano, the progression always sounds the same, just higher or lower overall as the case may be.) This is because a guitar player can\u2019t always move up or down by some number of semitones and play the same thing. You may think that you can solve this with a capo, but that\u2019s only half true. Let\u2019s say that you have learned a progression in the key of E on guitar. (This is the apparent premise of this question.) The keyboard player in your band says, \u201cI need that in G for my vocal range.\u201d No problem. You slap on your capo at the third fret and flail. Problem solved. But, what if he says, \u201cI need to go down three half-tones to sing that. You\u2019ll have to play that chord progression in D\u266d!\u201d (Say, what?) Knowing that negative capo application is not possible, you ask him what you should do. After scowling and smirking a bit, he explains that you could transpose to C and put a capo on at the first fret. Observing your blank look and the glint of fear in your eye engendered by the word \u201ctranspose\u201d, he patiently explains what chords to play, all of which you know. He then demonstrates playing the progression in D\u266d to prove that those are the right chords for you to play on guitar. It sounds the same to you when played on the piano, so you agree. The trouble is that when you play those key-of-C chords on guitar, which with capo 1 sound chords for the key of C\u266f (or D\u266d as it were), it all sounds totally different than it did in E, and much less interesting. What should you do?The big take-away you should get from #2 is that what the keyboard player thinks is important is the set of harmonic relationships between tones played, not the specific tones. You, on the other hand, are constrained in your ability to transpose chords by the hand shapes you use to finger them, so what you play is always going to sound different than what a keyboard player can produce. The reason is that piano chords tend to be \u201cbunched up\u201d with as many tones possible played in the same octave to facilitate playing them with one hand on an instrument with linearly-arranged ascending tones. Guitar chords, on the other hand, are played at closely spaced fret stops for multiple (i.e., six) strings of different tones ascending by a perfect fourth interval and one major third interval. But, each string, by nature of its fret stops, can sound a sequence of ascending semitones. As a result, guitar chords tend to be spread out in pitch over a two-octave range. This makes it hard to finger a chord that sounds like a piano chord with respect to how the tones are bunched in ascending pitch. You should also be aware that there are things a guitar player can do that are impossible, or at least more difficult for a piano player to replicate. Take that simple E chord that you\u2019ve just learned. You place three fingers on the A, D and G strings in the standard 02210 hand shape and strum. Voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve just played six tones over a two-octave range (E2, B2, E3, G\u266f3, B3 and E4) and you can use finger style or a plectrum to play all sorts of melodic figures while just holding that one chord shape with your fingering hand. Cool. That\u2019s something any beginner learns very quickly. On a piano, though, you need both hands and greater dexterity to play exactly the same thing. Or, how about playing chords, ascending or descending by some number of semitones with each tone in the chord going up or down by the same interval? This is one of the first things guitar players learn because it\u2019s one of the easiest things to do. It doesn\u2019t matter what chord it is. If you can finger it with three fingers, leaving the index finger free for barr\u00e9, you can slide that sucker anywhere you want on the neck and be playing exactly the right chord. Take an E9, for example. That\u2019s a pentad, a chord with five tones (E, G\u266f, B, D and F\u266f). Beginning keyboard players would have to think about that and laboriously construct it. But you, once informed that you can play a perfectly fine E9 with just three fingers as 020102, you quickly realize that using your index finger for barr\u00e9, you can play a 9th chord with any tone as the root tone using that one shape. It doesn\u2019t matter if you know the other portable shape for 9th chords and can also play E9 as X76777. It works, too. If you know them both, though, you\u2019ll be able to play any 9th chord without applying barr\u00e9 or demi-barr\u00e9 any higher than the sixth fret. See how fast a keyboard player can play a fast sequence of 9th chords. Hah! The same thing goes for any chord type, and I mean any. The relevance of this undeniable fact is that a lot of the things done in playing jazz stem from such uniform parallelism, which is at odds with and is encumbered by the specifics of standard keyboard layouts. There are other elements of jazz playing that are facilitated by keyboard layouts, and which are more difficult to learn and execute on the guitar. Try to improvise melodically on Giant Steps on guitar. As hard as that might be for a piano player, it\u2019s even more difficult for a guitar player to do. I certainly can\u2019t do it. There\u2019s a YouTube video where a guy shows you how to do it, and he plays it on a piano. Suffice it to say that guitars and keyboard instruments are different and have different capabilities. So, you should approach learning about any musical genre paying particular attention to what is different about guitar as compared to the instrument on which the genre being studied is principally played. This is important to know, but first one has to learn what one is trying to do. To learn about playing jazz chords on guitar, you have to learn about jazz chords and what gives them that particular sound. In other words, forget about being guitar-specific until you are conversant with the jazz idiom itself. To that end, there are lots of things to read about jazz, and jazz music to which you can listen, all of which is available for free on the internet. You have to look for it, or you can shell out money to the first person hawking something called \u201ceasy jazz chords for guitar\u201d or some such. It\u2019s your choice. I would suggest, though, that you shop around for information a little before committing resources and time to any purchase or formal course of study. You can read a few answers on Quora dealing with topics which interest you. The following question seems to be what you must have had in mind with the one I\u2019m answering here today. Omar Baltuth's answer to How do I begin to learn Jazz Chords on Guitar?There are a lot of useful answers to this question, but I suggest that you start with mine because it\u2019s geared toward novices while some of the others are more suited to those well-versed in music theory. Read the other answers, too, if you can understand them, because most of these writers know more about the topic than I do. I\u2019m just an amateur who can play guitar a little. Don\u2019t stop reading after you process several of the answers to that question. Use it as a launch pad to investigate the jazz idiom. Answers to other questions on Quora, including some of mine, will clue you into many chord progressions you should learn, but there is no substitute for learning how to play interesting chord progressions for music you like. Get the right chords to play for a specific song from an authoritative source, then learn how to play it. Even better, find musicological essays that analyze a favored musical piece as an example of a musicological principal. These don\u2019t have to be written. As I\u2019m winding up here, I\u2019m listening to a favorite YouTube video that I\u2019ve studied at length to get a handle on playing jazz chord progressions. Check this out. You\u2019ll get more useful information out of this under-11-minute tutorial than you would from a similar amount of time reading answers on Quora.  What any guitar player needs to become proficient with the jazz idiom goes far beyond just playing jazz and other kinds of music on guitar. Start with playing: You don\u2019t have to understand it to crank out the right notes and chords. But, once you can execute, find out what\u2019s going on from a technical, structural point of view. That means that you will have to delve into music theory. Even to understand this video about the Coltrane composition, you will need to understand the basics of standard musical notation and theoretical elements of Western musical structure. If you don\u2019t know enough of that to understand what they are talking about, stop watching the video and study up on theory before trying to watch the video again. It\u2019s like shampooing your hair. Wash, rinse and repeat until it\u2019s clean. ",
