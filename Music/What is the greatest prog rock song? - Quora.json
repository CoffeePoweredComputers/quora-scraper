            "answer_text": "Gosh that\u2019s too hard to answer. So many Prog songs I love equally that I would have to give you 25 at least, and I\u2019m libel to change my Mind, so in no specific order we have\u2026.  Comfortably numb Pink Floyd .such an epic song everything about it is great, it\u2019s very dark lyrically but also beautiful and as for that guitar solo,monumental.  Solsbury hill Peter Gabriel. A proper pop song by progs ultimate performer, it documents his split with prog behemoths Genesis.  Locomotive Breath Jethro Tull. A song from the seminal album aqualung a true rock classic.  Marillion Kayleigh. Another pop classic from arguably the best prog album of the 1980s  Yes Wondrous stories. I could make a list of Yes songs that could be argued to be the greatest prog songs of all time, but I went for this one released as punk was blazing in the uk.  Queen Bohemian Rhapsody. Everyone knows it, it\u2019s timeless and yes it comes from the time when Queen were in their Glam/Prog pomp.  Emerson, Lake and Palmer Karn evil 9. Mental sci fi song from the album brain salad surgery, so epically prog it takes up a side and a half of the album.  NEU! Hallo Gallo. Epic guitar work from Michael Rothe and it mesmerises you as it goes on and on and on \u2026.  Peter Hamill nadirs big chance. In the character of nadir Hamill blasts out an anti glam statement that is to all points and purpose is prophetic about the coming of punk rock . The song ends with the mantra smash the system with a song. Brilliant!  Gong I never glid before. An epic and unusual song from the criminally underrated Gong.  David Bowie station to station. Yes it\u2019s prog and it\u2019s epic, a song that shifts in styles and as for the lyrics, they cover everything from the occult, love and taking copious amounts of cocaine.  Genesis the carpet crawlers. A song from one of the maddest concept albums ever put to vinyl. No one seems sure what it\u2019s about, birth,babies or rebirth who cares. It\u2019s achingly beautiful.  Porcupine tree trains. Mind blowing track from the album in absentia which is an album that deals with mental illness, serial killers etc. This song is awesome.  Asia Heat of the moment. Prog supergroup with members of Yes,king crimson,E.L.P and the buggles tear up the charts with this ear worm and that guitar solo by Steve Howe Awesome!  King Crimson 21st century schizoid man. An epic and visceral track that mixes jazz and heavy rock. No one had ever heard anything like this before.  The Beatles tomorrow never knows. Still sounds like a miracle considering the technology they had. This is the Big Bang for me personally, when progressive really meant something, it\u2019s not a rehash of what went before ,it exists in a vacuum ,a giant leap forward.  Can I want more. Can have a massive hit single, this is timeless progpop from the masters of Krautrock.  Led zeppelin Kashmir. From the double album Physical Graffiti. Invokes a feeling of a place I\u2019ve never been before. Absolutely epic.  Rush closer to the heart. A pop gem from Rush and their classic prog album farewell to kings. Geddy lees vocal is so awesome.  Deep purple child in time. Awesome song from the mighty deep purple. Gillian\u2019s screams will live with you forever.  Van dear graff generator refugees. Achingly beautiful song from a prog classic album. Peter Hamills voice is like nothing ever heard before.  Renaissance northern lights. A whimsical and beautiful song that tore up the charts on its release.  Curved air back street luv. The beautiful Sonja sings her heart out on this classic hit of yesteryear, fabulous!  Kate Bush Hounds of love. Epic song from an epic album.This is Kate Bush in her pomp.  Supertramp give a little bit. Catchy as hell song from the brilliant supertramp. Big hit the world over. Personally to me there is no such thing as the greatest prog song, there are far too many songs in the genre for there to be one truly great song. I could list another song from above artists that could justifiably be considered their best. Or list songs from artists like atomic rooster,Roy Harper,camel, caravan, IQ, Roxy Music,Uk,Pallas ,focus,etc. But I hope you enjoy the list \u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "I could easily suggest the title track from Close to the Edge by Yes. One of my All-Time favorite songs (and albums.) Others would argue \u201cTime\u201d or \u201cUs and Them\u201d from The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd or \u201c21st Century Schizoid Man\u201d from In the Court of the Crimson King by King Crimson. Favorites and undisputed classics. However, perhaps the greatest achievement in the genre wasn\u2019t intentional. What I mean is this\u2026 Jethro Tull wasn\u2019t really known as a \u201cprog\u201d band. Their beginnings were immersed in the blues and throughout their career have dabbled in folk, Celtic, and hard rock. Tull had a commercial breakthrough with Aqualung which many deemed to be a concept album, an idea that Ian Anderson rejected stating it was just a collection of songs. Also, around the same period, many of the art-rock and prog-rock bands were becoming, shall we say, a bit pretentious. So, Anderson, Jethro Tull\u2019s primary songwriter, vocalist, and flautist thought it would be amusing to make fun of the pompous idea of a \u201cconcept album\u201d and deliver the ultimate concept album, tongue-in-cheek of course, with a parody of sorts. The result? Thick as a Brick. This phenomenal recording blended folk and classical genres within a rock framework with a variety of musical themes, time signature changes, and tempo shifts. There\u2019s even a bit of avant-garde jazz. For my money, the album, which is essentially presented as \u201cone song\u201d divided into two parts (due to the two sides of an LP) is 43-minutes and 46-seconds of pure genius. The lyrics are clever and the transitions from one section to another are dramatic with the individual sections blending naturally with recurring memorable themes. All of the instrumentation is perfect with numerous parts executed tastefully. The entire arrangement and production is stunningly well done. The band played a wide variety of musical instruments giving this masterpiece layers of sonic pleasure: Ian Anderson \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar, flute, violin, trumpet, saxophone.Martin Barre \u2013 electric guitar, lute.John Evan \u2013 piano, organ, harpsichord.Jeffrey Hammond \u2013 bass guitar, spoken word.Barriemore Barlow \u2013 drums, percussion, timpani. Unlike Aqualung which some folks thought (despite FM-radio hits such as \u201cCross-Eyed Mary,\u201d \u201cHymn 43,\u201d \u201cLocomotive Breath,\u201d and the title track) sounded a bit muddy at times, Thick as a Brick was recorded, mixed, and mastered exceptionally well. It\u2019s a sheer joy to listen to. With each listen, especially on a fine stereo system with reference monitors or in good headphones, you will discover how effective certain passages are with effects like the doubling of vocals, maybe a bit of reverb for emphasis, panning of things from left to right and back again, layering of acoustic and electric guitars, the transition from acoustic to electric, dueling flute solos, dueling guitar solos, dueling organ parts, and the odd, unusual instrument (for a rock band) such as a xylophone, adding flavor. Back in the glorious days of vinyl, it was always a delight to have interesting cover art and a bonus to find inserts such as posters or stickers. Here, \u201cThick as a Brick\u201d also delivered with a rather costly cover that unfolded into a 12\u2033 x 16\u2033, 12-page newspaper (The St. Cleve Chronicle & Linwell Advertiser) filled with many humorous, phony articles often making fun of small-town British press. The cover story basically told the story of an award-winning 8-year old genius, Gerald Bostock, who wrote the epic poem, \u201cThick as a Brick,\u201d and the controversy it created. Hilarious stuff! Thick as a Brick is a must-own album.  ",
