            "answer_text": "I can think of three. The first is \u201cMakin\u2019 It\u201d by David Naughton from the summer of 1979. This song was used in the soundtrack of the film \u201cMeatballs\u201d starring Bill Murray as well as the short lived TV series (9 episodes) by the same name from February and March of 1979. This TV show was ranked #40 by TV Guide in 2002 on its list of the 50 worst shows of all time. The second is \u201cThe Theme From Hill Street Blues\u201d starring Daniel J. Travanti by Mike Post featuring Larry Carlton from the tail end of 1981. The third is \u201cMoonlighting (Theme)\u201d starring Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd by Al Jarreau from the fall of 1987.

            "answer_text": "I would go with the theme from Peter Gunn. This tune is instantly recognizable. And while the TV show has mostly been forgotten, the theme is hugely popular in TV shows and movies even today. It is especially used in parody. The song was covered by many artists, but most famously it was used prominently in 1980's The Blues Brothers and a version of the song was released as a medley with Aretha Franklin's Think. This single reached number 39 on the dance chart. The song was written and arranged by Henry Mancini. It has been used in many TV shows and movies from the Sopranos to Mystery Science Theater 3000. From Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary to The Lion King 1 1/2. From Leave it to Beaver to Married\u2026with Children. ",
