            "answer_text": "Go to http://allmusic.comDo a search for \u201cWalpurgis\u201dOn the left side of the screen you will see a list of matches (e.g. artist; albums; songs; etc. and the number of matches)Click on songs and it will bring up a list of all songs in the database with Walpurgis in the name. When I did my search there were 103 matches (though many of them were for classical recordings, such as the works of Felix Mendelssohn).Hopefully you will recognize the band from the song listing but if not you can click on the song title and it will take you to a list of albums it appeared on. If you click on one of the albums it will take you to a list of the songs on the album \u2014 many of those songs may have a \u201cplay\u201d button (triangle in a circle) which you can click on to hear a short sample of the song.Happy hunting.",
