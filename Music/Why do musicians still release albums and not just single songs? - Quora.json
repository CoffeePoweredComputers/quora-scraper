            "answer_text": "There are some great answers here, but there\u2019s one more reason - concept. In the \u201960s and \u201870s, concept albums were the thing. Sgt. Pepper\u2019s is a great example - it tells a sort of story from beginning to end. The listener is taken on a journey that ultimately ends on the world\u2019s hugest endless chord (when it was on vinyl, it was designed to hold that last groove indefinitely so the chord would actually continue to play until you or the machine lifted the needle off.) The Rock Opera \u201cTommy\u201d by the Who is another great example, because it does tell a story. Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d was a concept album, as was their follow-up, \u201cThe Wall.\u201d The ultimate concept album is designed to be listened to in a single sitting, in the order the songs appear on the playlist or the LP or CD. Even though such continuity is now broken up because of the streaming format, it\u2019s still a very valid idea. Back in the day, us Hippies would drop acid or smoke a lot of weed, pop on the old \u201ccans\u201d (Stereo headphones) and go on a journey with the artists. One of my most intense spiritual/astral traveling experiences EVER was with side 2 of \u201cAbbey Road\u201d by the Beatles. People write songs because they have something to say that they hope you will hear. Sometimes they just have a lot more to say at once. The last great concept album I remember was \u201cCloud Nine\u201d by George Harrison, back in the \u201880s. I\u2019m sure there are more modern examples, but it\u2019s almost a lost art at this point. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the more songs you record, the more choice the audience has to stream your music. If you record just one song, your only hope to make any decent money is that it is a big hit, and many people stream it / buy it. If it is not, it won\u2019t make you any money. Record 15 songs, and your chances are 15 times higher that one of them may be a hit. The likelihood is also higher that people will like at least some of them; some people will like one, some another, tastes are different, but with a whole album, you give them options, and many more people are likely to find at least something they like. And in the end, if you give them an album, and they really love you as an artist, they will listen to the entire album (possibly multiple times in a day). Nobody can keep listening to a single song over and over (except 3-year olds\u2026). By recording an album, you maximise the earning potential of your music. ",
