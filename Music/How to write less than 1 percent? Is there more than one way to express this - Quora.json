            "answer_text": "It depends if you are referring to an amount that can be calculated as an actual number or a general amount. If you intend to refer to a measurable amount, you should say \u201cfewer than one percent.\u201d If you want to refer to a very small amount, but you cannot come up with an exact number, but you know it is less than one percent, you should say \u201cless than one percent.\u201d If you know the exact amount, you should state the number. For example, \u201chalf of one percent\u201d or \u201c0.5%\u201d Edit: As Selena Palmer and John English pointed out, the way to write the concept of \u201cless than one percent using mathematical symbols, rather than words is: <1% < is the symbol for less than. > is the symbol for more than. When I originally answered the questin, I thought you were asking about a specific number, But for all possible numbers that are less the one, just say <1%. ",

            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t need to be specific about the amount then you can just say \u201ca fraction of a percent\u201d. In some cases it would be considered a \u201ctrace amount\u201d but this is slightly different and has specific levels depending on the field you are writing about. (See Trace element for more detail). Many of the other answers cover the other grammatical and scientific notations which are all perfectly valid, unfortunately, this is a case of a question that would need more detail for a better answer. For example, if you are talking about the \u201cone percent of people\u201d then you could be referring to the hyper rich in the world, that also changes the tone and with that, notation, a little.
