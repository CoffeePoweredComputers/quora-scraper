            "answer_text": "I agree with the answer below on some points. I would trust an onboard Rega phono stage before many others. I\u2019m not a huge fan of Pro-Ject phono stages and find them to be overpriced in general. And while I do think the P1 is a good entry level table, I\u2019m not a fan of the cartridge Rega puts on it. It\u2019s just a little too cheap and performs under other entry level carts being put on other entry level tables. If the rega P1 is something you have your sights set on, I\u2019d spring for the performance package or whatever variant they now offer and skip the onboard preamp. The performance package should include the white reference belt and I believe it has a better cartridge, but I could be wrong. Either way, go that slight step up. I have the white reference belt on my vintage Rega Planar 2 and it made a huge improvement in speed stability. The white belt should really be standard on all Regas at this point, but u fortunately it\u2019s not. Then get the ART DJ Pre II phono preamp. It cost $50 and it has become the de facto sleeper preamp. It also has a rumble filter, capacitance control and a full gain pot to get the output gain just right. Very few preamps costing hundreds offer this much control and the ART offers it for $50 and does it well. Then you perform a simple upgrade to the ART DJ pre II that takes it to the next level. It can run on 9\u201312v. The included power supply only puts out 9v and it\u2019s a switching power supply that introduces switching noise into the audio signals. You got to parts express and buy the $25 bench power supply with selectable voltage. This is a linear power supply that creates no switching noise and it can be run at 12v. Set it to 12v and use a DC adapter cable to connect it to the ART. Now throw away the original power supply and never look back. You now have a preamp that cost you roughly $75 that sounds like it costs a few hundred. And it gives you the control to get the sound just right. Look up the ART preamp and you will see tons of people agreeing with me about its performance and the power supply upgrade being a simple and genius decision. I run this on my vintage Rega Planar 2 with Linn LVX tonearm and Ortofon 2M blue cartridge and it sounds pretty damn great and I don\u2019t plan to upgrade anything until I take my whole system to the next level.

            "answer_text": "Rega makes great turntables. The Planar 1 Plus is a Planar 1 + a moving magnet phono stage. It is very much designed to be a \u201cplug and play\u201d \u201cset it and forget\u201d product. You won\u2019t get a lot of flexibility with the cartridges you can choose or the tone arms. You also can\u2019t upgrade the phono stage. If you\u2019re ok with those limitations \u2014 and many users would be \u2014 then this is a great choice. But if you think that you might want more flexibility in the future, the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon[1]+ a phono stage is a better choice.
