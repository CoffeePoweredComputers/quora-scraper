            "answer_text": "We share our love for kong and xylophone that\u2019s for sure This is Thai Kong Circle  And this is Indonesian  The Ranad, or wood xylophone is the most basic element of Thai traditional ensemble, comparable in role to the European piano (the xylophone is not always made from wood though, sometime metal is used which gave a louder, more \u201cmetallic\u201d sound  Ranad And this is Indonesia traditional xylophone, notice the similarity?  And this Ranad in the Thai traditional band in all its glory  And here is Indonesian  Notice the strong resemblance in instruemts type and componenet? I have some very brief experience with Indinesian traditional music (but know ours quite extensively) but from brief impression, Indonesia and Thailand traditonal music are so similar to one another that I was very surprised. Both are percussion, rather than string-based music, which when compare to the typical European or even Chinese classical music, gave a very distinct \u201ctexture\u201d. If symphony is like a soup with all the sound blended together to create a one homogeneous \u201charmony\u201d of sound with each tone blend seamlessly together to create one melody, the music in Indonesia and Thailand is like salad. Instruments not only don\u2019t working together, they actively compete with each other and even expect to give their own \u201ccadenza\u201d (live improvisation\u201d at their own call. And because most of the instrument are percussion, the harmonic concept between each of the instrument is very different. The sound of striking wood, cloth, and metal, come together to paint a very different picture like a heavily decorated architect of both country. There are sound as soft as piano forte, glittering sound of metal in fast tempo, and a majestic kong that bind everything together. It isn\u2019t necessary always a pleasant experience but very educational and refreshing change. ",
