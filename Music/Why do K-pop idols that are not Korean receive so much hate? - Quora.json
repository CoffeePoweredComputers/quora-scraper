            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not very sure about this but I think this is because of \u201cracism\u201d in K-Pop. As we all know racism has existed a long time ago in many Western areas. But through times, racism has fade away slowly. Asia is divided into many regions, which one of the weakest religion in development in including Southeast Asia. We got a lot of non-Korean K-Pop members in this religion, example Lisa from BlackPink. I think one of the reasons, is her beauty. Her beauty isn\u2019t the same as the other Koreans, so that may make some other people think anything that is negative about her. And maybe others that influenced her like her country, culture,\u2026 There could be many ways. But I think the main reasons, is the hater themselves. As me myself who got a friend who is Korean, she told me that Koreans aren\u2019t really open to other countries. For example, us Vietnamese really appreciate the Korean visitors. But in reply, when I went to Korea as a visitor. I don\u2019t see there open spirits and positivity, that might be why. It also happens with other countries from other places as well. But not all Koreans are so, so don\u2019t worry my friend. If you get to know them well and is open to them, you will find them really nice. In my opinion, K-Pop racism is a big problem for idols who are in another region. But, for now let\u2019s just don\u2019t think about it too much. Racism isn\u2019t good, the haters will think about how wrong they are for hating them, and how great the idols are. ",

Hope you got what I am saying and may be this is helpful\u2026.. Sorry if I made any mistake \ud83d\udc9c ",
