            "answer_text": "Despite what everyone has been writing here, the answer to who wins this fight is Hinata. For some reason, people see Hinata as some cute Hyuga with barely any abilities. She's just some pampered princess. Well, I'll have you know, Hinata is the STRONGEST HYUGA ALIVE NOW!! Hinata trained with Neji, she wanted to get stronger bu5 she lacked something. Motivation or goal. Something to really push her past that limit. She found that in Naruto.   Hinata developed her Chakra control so well that she was as good as a Medical - nin. Yes, with no training in medical Ninjutsu. She even has better Chakra control than Ino, who is a Medical-nin. In the combined Justu in which intense Chakra control was required. Shizune stated that Hinata has Medical-Nin level Chakra control so she could be the fourth member of the Jutsu (Which needs 4 members). Ino was the only one who was a bit shaky, Hinata was just fine. Her Chakra control is even better than Sakura now.   Hinata has held own against Tendo Pain (The strongest version) albeit for a few seconds. He was even scared to let her get into close range.  Hinata has developed two new Jutsu. She has a Justu which she compresses her Chakra into small needle like structures and spin them rapidly. They can be used for defense or offense. Really can't remember the name sorry. All i know is that it's badass.   She also developed the Twin Great Lion Fist technique that greatly amplifies her Taijutsu. That's how she was able to face pain.  Then During the Tenseigan arc. She was given Hamura\u2019s Chakra by Toner Ostustuki and it improved all her Justu. Her Lion Fist Technique changed color and it became so powerful that it could destroy the Tenseigan.  Sakura has Healing and strength. But she doesn't have precision or good defense. If she keeps getting hit by Hinata, she'll either get her chakra points blocked or she'll lose Chakra trying to keep fighting. Hinata can defend any attack from long range with palm rotation. But if she gets close to Sakura, that match is over. She's the freaking Godess of The White Eye, brute strength doesn't cut it. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's first start with Sakura.  Sakura's strength is just okay. I mean she did this to the ground once.    She's also punched a ten tail clone which I've heard from the grapevine is pretty alright.  Sakura has also punched this 1 random called Kaguya? I think her name was.  Sakura actually has some pretty decent speed and reaction feats as well. You'll have to watch the anime to get a better grasp on though.   She's shown good speed and reaction times but nothing that makes her stand out. Sakura is durable.  She can survive getting stabbed with some healing and she's immortal\u2026\u2026..Kinda. It can regenerate her body but it comes at the cost of her natural life span.  It's called creation rebirth and it's somewhat neat.  Sakura can summon a slug that spits acid\u2026\u2026. It does take a little bit of time though. Sakura has numerous healing methods but most are basically useless in the midst of a battle. She's a very formidable opponent and can smack almost anyone silly with her punches. Now it's time to talk about Hinata.  Oops wrong one.  Better.  Hinata has this thing called the Byakugan. What can the Byakugan do? This.  Looking back this kinda makes me question the whole Kaguya feat. Well anyway not only does Hinata have a automatic advantage over most Taijutsu fights but she can also close off your Chakra points.  Sakura has little to nothing that can beat Hinata from long range. Even if she tried to use her summons Hinata would eventually catch up to her due to the amount of time it takes to summon.  Hinata can Eight Palm Vacuum palm her cutting off Sakura's Chakra from a distance.  Hinata also knows the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven technique which can do this.  Sakura can definitely 1 shot Hinata but the problem is that Hinata has the ability to know every attack that comes her way immediately and has the ability to defend herself with little to no flaws while also being able to injure her opponent if they decide to make physical contact with her while using it. Sakura whole moveset is centered around Chakra including her strength and Creation Birth immortality ability. So who would win?  Hinata would win 9/10 times. Edit: I'm not quite down yet I'll add some more feats from Sakura and Hinata later. ",
