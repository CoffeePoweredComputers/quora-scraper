Like the other commenters, I also think Jennie has a pretty eye-shape. Kind of foxy?  IZ*ONE\u2019s Wonyoung\u2019s eyes make her look like a bunny. So adorable!  Irene is pretty from head to toe, makes sense she has pretty, kind-looking eyes too.  And if you\u2019re just talking about color, Somi has lighter brown (?) eyes.  ",

It\u2019s make him looks more unique than most K-pop idols with his eyes. TWICE\u2019s Jihyo  Jihyo\u2019s eyes are so pretty and huge. She looks like a doll with that eyes. I can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s actually Korean when I saw her for the first time. This girl never get a plastic surgery because she\u2019s natural beauty. ITZY\u2019s Yeji  I personally love her cat eyes because it\u2019s made her looks fierce. Edit: The original question was asking about all K-pop idols, but it\u2019s changed to K-pop female idols. So, I\u2019m not going to change anything on my answer. That\u2019s all, bye. ",
