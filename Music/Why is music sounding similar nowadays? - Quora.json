            "answer_text": "Open your mind to the next idea: the music hasn\u2019t changed, you have changed. Remember your parents, calling all your music the same? When you\u2019re a teenager, as you realize later, you have very little responsibilities (although life feels hard as it is), and you can spend hours and hours listening to music. All that music is new to you, and you hear a plethora of details and differences. However, your brain grows, your experiences grow and your repsonsibilities grow. Now you don\u2019t have time to listen to music for hours, and where you couldn\u2019t wait for the next Top-40 list and this-weeks-new-records when you were fourteen, you notice one new song every two weeks or so. You\u2019ve seen genres and artists come and go, and lived even through revivals calles \u2018retro- \u2018 (which of course weren\u2019t the real thing). You can\u2019t point out Beatles- and Led Zeppelin influences, and mainly get nostalgic by Amy Whinehouse and Adele. So it\u2019s mainly your ears that got trained and blas\u00e9. You\u2019ve heard it all before. For youngsters however it is the same as for you when you were fourteen. For them it\u2019s new, they hear the details and the differences. Hours of listening, learning 30 new songs a week, hardly can\u2019t wait for a new album. They don\u2019t know yet, but the older guys are always similar, not nowadays, they are so already for ages.

            "answer_text": "Because it is the same. A 2015 study of more than 500,000 albums found that as a genre becomes successful it gets used more and more to create potential hits. After all, that last one was a hit, so let's have another just like that. This filters down to finding the same or similar producers, songwriters, instruments, artists, rhythms, et al as record companies seek to minimise risk and maximise profits. And the industry now is all about money. Certainly there are some artists who are going it alone but the music-buying public who are largely too damn lazy too look beyond what gets dished up to them, don't care. And songs aren't just sounding the same: various studies have shown less variation in dynamic range and timbre, and a dumbing-down and homogenisation of lyric. It's McDonald's, but with music. ",
