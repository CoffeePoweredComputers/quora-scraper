            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say the vast majority actually do that, not just some. Singles are usually released as a marketing tool for a particular album, so it makes sense to have them included on the album as well. The song versions may not be quite the same (the single version may often be edited for length or use a slightly different mix compared to the version on the album), but they\u2019re still close enough to be recognisable. Not every band or artist does it though - here in the UK, it was quite a common practice for bands & solo artists to release stand-alone singles that weren\u2019t tied to a particular album back in the 60s & 70s (and beyond), though not so much these days (you\u2019ll still get many acts releasing the odd one though, perhaps between albums or to promote a compilation release).

            "answer_text": "(Edit - I\u2019ve read this question as \u2018why do artists add singles that were not originally on the album into the album at a later date\u2019. If this wasn\u2019t the intention of the question I\u2019m sorry!) To boost their album streams. In the UK, streams for the album chart are calculated by taking the average of the top 12 songs, and downweighting the top 2 to the average of the other 10. Obviously this was an attempt to stop the album chart being determined by the singles in the album, however any more than two singles on an album and suddenly you\u2019ve got singles counting towards the album chart. The more singles you\u2019ve got counting towards the album chart, the higher the album gets. Boom! \u201cBut why don\u2019t they put the songs on the album in the first place and then release them as singles?\u201d I hear you ask. Well that\u2019s relatively simple - now streaming is a thing, when a high-profile artist releases an album, everyone\u2019s already heard all the songs from the album. So releasing a song from that album as a *single* is ineffective - would you rather listen to a new song or a song you over-played last month? With a few exceptions (Harry Styles is a major one at the moment), post-album singles tend to do badly - even artists such as Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift have missed the Top 40 with their post-album singles. So, as an artist, it makes mucch more sense to release another new song and then tack it on to the album to get a higher chart placing. I\u2019ll leave you with the chart run of Mabel\u2019s album \u2018High Expectations\u2019 and you can guess the points at which a random song was tacked on.  ",
