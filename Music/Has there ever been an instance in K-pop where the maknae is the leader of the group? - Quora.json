            "answer_text": "Mostly The Leader has Unnies Line is the most. the group leader is usually the one who speaks on behalf of the group and generally takes care of the group. With Maknae Line(As 2nd youngest member up) when was The Leader too. But when The Leader has Maknae is rarely found it and uncommon PLAYBACK - Hwang Woolim (Inactive)  Woolim was no longer the maknae-leader, however, when they made a comeback in 2017 with \u201cWant You To Stay\u201d as member Eunjin was added to the group. Recently may have disbanded silently or gone on an indefinite hiatus. 2ne1 - CL (No Longer Active)  For a very short period after Minzy left 2ne1 in Apr.2016, CL became the youngest in the group. As she was already the leader since debut, this made her the maknae leader of one of K-Pop\u2019s top girl groups until they disbanded in May.2016. Winner - Kang seungyoon (Active)  He was a few months older than Nam Taehyun, he was younger than Seungyeon for 4 months. Moreover, Mino was the leader until Yang Hyun Suk (Leader of YG Entertainment) gave Seungyeon the position from WIN: Who Is Next. Now Seungyoon is known among the members and fans as the pillar and rock of WINNER. Tiny.G - J-Min (Active/Unknown)  Tiny-G haven\u2019t disbanded yet but For Tiny-G members have silently or gone on a hiatus. Rencently Tiny-G is under MFLOW Entertainment with Sub-Unit \u201cTiny-G M\u201d debuted \u201cThe only one\u201d But it silently a hitaus again. Pinkfantasy - Arang (Active)  Aini has plantar flasciitis, painful inflammation of the thick tissue that goes from the front of the toes to the heel, and it has made it difficult for her to practice choreography and participate in past activities. And left the group to saved healthy next time. Meanwhile, it has also been confirmed that the group's maknae Arang will be taking her place as the leader. SNSD TTS - Seohyun *Sub-Unit  Taeyeon may be the leader of SNSD but Seohyun was the leader of their unit group TTS. Taeyeon revealed in a 2014 broadcast of SBS\u2018s Power FM Kim Chang Ryul\u2019s Old School Radio that she and Tiffany chose their maknae to lead the group. BULLDOK - Kimi (No Longer Active)  I seem quite underrated maknae leader but Sadly She left the group to focus on her solo activities. This theory is supported by the fact and Disbanded in 2 years. Recently she being soloist but i hope waiting for teaser coming soon. Boys - Seo Taiji (Active)  Seo Taiji and Boys was the OG K-Pop group who was active from 1992-1996. Their leader and face, Seo Taiji, was also the youngest among the trio as he was born in Feb.1972. In comparison, Lee Juno was born in Feb.1967 and Yang Hyunsuk was born in Jan.1970. Seo Taiji paved the way for leaders, maknaes, and maknae-leaders since the nineties. N*White - Soohyun (No longer Active)  I seem look pure maknae leader but when hitaus after officially debuted. The group disbanded in 2016. So its same as Tiny-G but sadly hasn\u2019t not much fanclub for working hard again. Ok I can find all groups mostly Leader has Unnie line but not Oldest only the 2nd or 3rd ss Leader too. But thanks for requested!! ",

The ones that I know of who are currently Maknae leaders: Winner\u2019s Seungyoon  He wasn\u2019t always the leader nor was he always the youngest. Minho was the original leader of the group but gave up that role and Seungyoon, who was the 2nd youngest at the time, was appointed leader. But then Taehyun, the youngest, left the group so now Seungyoon is also the Maknae. - Pink Fantasy\u2019s Arang  She was not the original leader. The group\u2019s original leader Aini, left the group I believe due to chronic injury in her legs, so Arang was appointed leader afterwards. - I believe there was a brief time where CL of 2ne1 was the leader/Maknae of the group after Minzy left but before the group disbanded.
