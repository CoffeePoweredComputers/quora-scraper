            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been a long time since I touched anything related to traditional Thai or Indonesian music. I must also admit that I don\u2019t have that much knowledge regarding the music tradition of our sothern neighbour but from my overall impression, I think the biggest difference is the choice. Thai traditional music feature a wooden xylophone (Ranad) heavily and in general, this is also the instrument that formed the basis for nearly every style of Thai traditional ensemble. Not too different from the role of a grand piano in the west.  Ranad For Indonesian music, that role seems to be played much more heavily by a Gong Chime (basically metal xylophone) which give both a very different sound texture.  Gong Chim Overall, however, both countries used a lot of overlapping instrument. The woodwind that had been used in both countries are very similar and well as the xylophone set and gong. It just comes to how both deploy them in music that made both unique from one another. ",
