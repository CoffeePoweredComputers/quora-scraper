            "answer_text": "From the artists themselves. Many independent artists will list their tracks on sites like BandCamp or SoundCloud.  Many are also available for \"Name Your Own Price\", which can absolutely mean $0.00. If they don't have music set up on these sites for free.  Try contacting the band themselves.   If you're just looking for new music to listen to, and cannot afford to pay for it, you might get some mp3s just by asking.  Same if you're looking for music to use in a media project.  A lot of bands would be happy with the exposure. You'll have less luck with major label artists. If you're trying to get free music, even though you have the money to pay for it, you don't deserve it. I'm not going to tell you from where you can pirate music. ",
