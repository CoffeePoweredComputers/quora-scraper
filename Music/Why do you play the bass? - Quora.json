            "answer_text": "In short, because of this guy:  Actually it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that: When I was in fourth grade I wanted to be in the school band. My family doesn\u2019t have a lot of money so I thought I\u2019d be doing them a big favor by playing one of my parents instruments. That meant my options were flute or trumpet. Obviously I picked trumpet. But I didn\u2019t enjoy it and quit after sixth grade. I can\u2019t sing at all and I generally don\u2019t consider myself a musician, but I used to think in seventh or eight grade if I did learn anything it would be drums. However, way too much goes into playing drums and I\u2019m not nearly athletic enough for it so I gave up that notion. Going back to the guy in the above picture, my favorite band is The Clash and their bassist is Paul Simonon, who, if you couldn\u2019t tell from the photo, was the epitome of cool when he was younger and kind of still is:  The Clash has some really good basslines (even if they weren\u2019t always played by Simonon), and so I have come to associate the bass guitar with god-like coolness. Not to mention that Simonon learned to play bass when he was nineteen and I had often thought that I, at fifteen, was a little old to start learning an instrument, considering my brother started learning ukulele at ten. And when you listen to Clash records you can just heard the bass improving. For example, the difference between their first album where he was pretty much just the guitarist\u2019s parrot to their third when he wrote his own song is amazing. So I figured I could pick up bass and it would be really cool and sound good. I never considered actually doing it, though, until my Mom asked me if there was any instrument I would like to learn after my younger brother started teaching her ukulele. I told her I wouldn\u2019t mind learning bass guitar and the next week we had bought a Peavey Milestone and an amp from the music store in a nearby city. It took her months to find me a teacher in our small town, and now I\u2019m better than my teacher, so it\u2019s probably good my younger brother is pretty much a musical genius, because he can probably teach me more without even knowing what he\u2019s doing.  Seriously, who doesn\u2019t want to look like that? But since I\u2019m not six feet tall and wasn\u2019t blessed with testosterone and amazing genetics, the easiest way I can look more like that is to play bass. And while playing the bass won\u2019t make me as cool or attractive as Paul Simonon, I do genuinely enjoy playing it and jamming out with my brother. ",

            "answer_text": "So I can have the biggest guitar onstage. Hey, ladies!! It really comes down to what I told a guy I was in a band with. He wanted to know what instrument I wanted to play in the nascent organization. The answer was that I could be the most musical benefit the band by playing bass guitar. You know, make it sound like a band playing the song even during a guitar solo. Also, I'm a bit of drummer whisperer. You've just got to have that guy on your side or you're screwed. I can't remember the last drummer I played with and we didn't get along. ",
