            "answer_text": "I think that there are a lot of high school garage musicians out there that have a distorted view as to what it is really like to be rich and famous. They think it\u2019s about getting women, living large, going to the best parties and nightclubs. And many times, if they are very young, they have no idea what temptations are out there that they may or may not have the ability to stay away from. Or they want into the business in order to GET to those temptations. Imagine being a boy or a man only a few years out of high school, and all of a sudden, you are famous and people want a piece of you. The hottest women who didn\u2019t give you the time of day in high school now want you, you can buy whatever you want \u2018cause that money is just rolling in, and everyone wants to be around you. And every night is a potential party, with all the drugs and booze and sex you can physically stand. How do you fend all that off and keep your head on straight? The music world is a rough one. There are people around you that you constantly have to be wary of like girlfriends/boyfriends, you have to make sure the people you hire to work for you have your back so you can be sure they don\u2019t steal you blind, the temptation to do drugs or alcohol (that stuff is all around you and there is pressure to indulge), the temptation to risk your marriage or existing relationship on one night stands with young women while you are touring, dealing with fame so excessive you literally can\u2019t live a normal life, and the stress of constant touring and having to crank out albums on a timeline set by the company you have a contract with. And of course, you have to worry about whether you will be in it for the long haul\u2014you might be cool and making stupid money today, but tomorrow you won\u2019t be able to attract flies and might have to move out of your mansion. Many, many musicians have been broken by the above, either because they didn\u2019t treat their careers like a job that required that they be able to focus, or they were simply too immature to deal with the pressures and temptations, or they had other issues like depression or mental issues that were exacerbated by the stress. Those that survive it are usually mentally healthy or take steps to get mentally healthy, have the maturity to steer clear of the temptations and dangerous/sketchy people, and see it as a job first and foremost and approach it as such. They avoid the parties and temptation to get addicted to alcohol or drugs, stay grounded with people they know and trust, stay serious about their craft, and employ a hard nosed attitude toward the business end. From what I know of Cobain, he suffered from depression. He may have been passionate about his music in the beginning, but the depression as well as fame rendered him vulnerable to situations, addictions, and people he should have stayed away from, and he was unable to make good choices. He apparently didn\u2019t get help for his depression and it wound up not only destroying his ability to function as a very famous musician,\u2014it literally killed him. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know that Kurt Cobain really did have a problem with fame. Cobain's problems seemed rooted in his drug addiction and whatever underlying psychological issues drove him to take drugs. Fame and money may have helped facilitate that addiction to some degree, but it's clear from his journals and people who knew him that Cobain was already heavily involved with drugs, including heroin, before Nevermind really took off. Obviously many lesser lights in the music industry succumbed to addiction as well. Drug addiction often brings on feelings of shame and depression in the user because essentially you've made yourself sick and only you can make yourself better. Certainly there was pressure on Cobain to get better, he was a new father and leader of a successful band, but there would have been similar pressures even if Nirvana hadn't sold millions of records. And Kurt didn't really shun fame either. While his Punk ethos required a certain kind of posture or attitude of disdain toward fame and success, his actions don't suggest that he was trying to avoid becoming famous. Cobain certainly did lots of interviews and photoshoots while he was alive. As the leader of Nirvana, Kurt didn't refuse to sign with a major label as some Alternative bands did, nor did he refuse to make music videos the way some acts did back in those days. In fact Kurt was usually front and center in the videos. People who really don't want to be famous don't go on SNL or play the MTV Music Awards. Some massively successful Rock bands really do take steps to avoid the limelight (Pink Floyd, Tool), but Nirvana didn't take that route. I don't see any reason to believe that Kurt Cobain wouldn't have killed himself if his band had been less successful. The issues (drug addiction, failing marriage) still would have been there and there's no reason to think that annominity would have helped him cope. Fame didn't kill Cobain, it just wasn't enough to keep him going. ",
