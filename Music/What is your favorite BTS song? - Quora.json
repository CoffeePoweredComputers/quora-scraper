            "answer_text": "My top 10 favourite BTS songs are, in no particular order: 2!3!: This gives me chills every goddamn time I listen to it, I especially love it when they perform this song because when Armys take over, I get goosebumps. The bond Armys and BTS have with each other is invaluable and the raw emotion behind their voices (especially rap line) make me really emotional too, and every time I hear the song I either almost cry or actually cry. Plus, the lyrics are so inspirational and reassuring\u2026 they're here for us and they\u2019re showing that we\u2019re here for them by being open and honest about their own emotions and life journey.Young Forever: The thing about this song is that while it\u2019s called Young Forever, it never talks about how amazing youth is and how it feels to be young. It\u2019s more about loving the way they are now and never wanting to change (main example in this is J-Hope\u2019s line: \u201cEven if the attention isn\u2019t forever, I\u2019ll keep singing/As today\u2019s me, I want eternity/Forever, I want to be young\u201d - not gonna lie, my favourite part and lyric) which I think is such a beautiful thing. They\u2019re scared of the future and also have bad moments (like Suga\u2019s bit tells us) but all in all, life is beautiful. The lyrics are so gorgeous and it accurately shows what some people feel: you don\u2019t want things to change for fear of the future but also because you like it the way you are now, but that doesn\u2019t mean life isn\u2019t amazing - there are still bad moments we all have to deal with.N.O: This is my first title track on this list because I absolutely adore this song. Listen, the lyrics are so freeing and inspirational, especially because it came from a place where they weren\u2019t doing so well either. Despite all their hardships, they told us to stop listening to others and do what we want to do because even if they\u2019re struggling, they still loved what they did and wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. For most of us Asians (and other ethnicities too), it seems a lot like us vs our parents. Do we listen to them like society pressures us to do, or do we do what we want to do and make our own path even if it means personal sacrifices? I really identified with this song because it\u2019s true - we can\u2019t keep listening to them as they try to push back our dreams by saying \u201clater\u201d all the time. One of my favourite BTS title tracks of all time.I\u2019m Fine: This is one song that I wish we got more performances of even if we already have quite a few. I love everything about this song: from the lyrics to the choreography to the aesthetic. I absolutely love their performances of this because the choreography is gorgeous: the entrance where Taehyung lies down on top of his members seem very symbolic to me even if it isn\u2019t supposed to have a meaning (I interpreted it as the members being each other\u2019s support) and I really loved how original it was (also, it gave me a little bit of I Need U vibes where Taehyung\u2019s the one being sat on by Hoseok). The lyrics are so positive and happy because it\u2019s about moving on from the dark times of your life to happier times - they reflect on the people who helped them and says that I think I\u2019m fine, I\u2019ll let go of your hand now. It\u2019s important to accept help and realise that you can\u2019t do it alone and I loved that because it\u2019s something I need to remind myself sometimes and it gives a lot of credit to the people who help you behind the scenes. While independence is definitely very important, co-dependence is too. (Plus Suga\u2019s rap verse is absolutely lit)Answer: Love Myself: I\u2019m not gonna lie, one of the main reasons I picked this song was because of Suga\u2019s entire verse (I don\u2019t want to take up more space than necessary so here\u2019s a small teaser of the original lyrics: \uc5b4\uca4c\uba74 \ub204\uad70\uac00\ub97c \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uac8c \ub098 \uc790\uc2e0\uc744 \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\ub294 \uac70\uc57c\uc194\uc9c1\ud788 \uc778\uc815\ud560 \uac74 \uc778\uc815\ud558\uc790\ub2c8\uac00 \ub0b4\ub9b0 \uc7a3\ub300\ub4e4\uc740 \ub108\uc5d0\uac8c \ub354 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\ub2e8 \uac78). This song overall is an amazing song: I love the energy, the lyrics are amazing from start to finish. I could copy and paste any lyric from the song and it would be a form of art, really. It makes me feel much better about myself and I guess it\u2019s a very nostalgic song for me, it makes me thing about my own past and pick up on my own flaws while also giving me a reprieve from self-loathing.Tomorrow: I love this song the same way I love Answer: Love Myself. Obviously they\u2019re two completely different songs and they sound different and have completely different lyrics, but I love the energy we get when they sing this song on the album and when they perform it. For the rest of us that aren\u2019t celebrities or entertainers or whatever, we probably feel what they sing: life is repetitive, the same work, the same everything and most of us probably aren\u2019t ever going to be rich no matter how hard you work and will always be working or middle class, the repetitiveness is probably never going to end and it makes things\u2026 boring. Tomorrow isn\u2019t a \u201cnew\u201d day, it feels more like today but just repeated. But this song accurately represents the mindset of probably the majority - and the more we can hope for, really, is that someday something will break and change and be a little more exciting, a little more positive.Pied Piper: I love this song for the obvious reasons. The cheekiness of the lyrics just puts a smile on my face: it\u2019s humorous because they\u2019re being so cocky by almost making fun of the \u201cstan\u201d mindset but they\u2019re not really making fun of their fans. It isn\u2019t about \u201cGo get a life you losers\u201d or \u201cMy pockets are filled with cash that I spend on partying\u201d like you\u2019d expect when you hear the word cocky in regards to lyrics, but in a different way. The lyrics seem more like they\u2019re worried for us and it\u2019s such a fun little song. The song itself is hypnotising and the vocals are goddamn beautiful. I know it\u2019s deliberate but it genuinely seems to put me under a spell, like the Pied Piper. And also because it\u2019s a very obvious tale, not too deep for me to have to try and prise open to understand.House of Cards: This is a song that I just love and not for any particular reason, I just love the haunting and mysterious beauty of their voices. I\u2019ve never experienced love like they\u2019re describing so it\u2019s a little difficult for me to relate to it, but I love the hypnotic breathiness of it and the beautiful idea of something so shaky and about to tip over: I\u2019m almost on edge the whole way throughout the song. Also, the whispery last line is so emotional and such a memorable way to end the song for me, it really makes an impact.Ddaeng: One of my absolute favourite rap line songs, I thought it was so good because it also had like an easy inspiration. I remember singing the original song as a child and it was such a shock and really creative for them to put a spin on it the way they did. I loved the points of the song, how it almost seemed repetitive but had a different meaning each time. The wordplay was really fun and I was really surprised how direct they were being to be honest, they hadn\u2019t been that direct about their criticisms for a while.Spring Day: No list would be complete without the queen, Spring Day. This song, I am not gonna lie, did not make me cry but it\u2019s because I thought that despite the very emotional and quite dark lyrics, it seemed a very hopeful song to me. It wasn\u2019t completely miserable but it reminded me of that quote that says \u201cLight at the end of the tunnel\u201d but it almost seemed like the lyrics were describing someone who was almost at the end of the tunnel and the light was reachable. After N.O, this has got to be my favourite title track. The performance aspect of it was absolutely beautiful as well, the choreography is complicated so it reminds a very \u201cBTS\u201d song but it\u2019s also very peaceful so it matches the tone of the song (also, a small sidenote but I thought their outfits were also very calm and soft that it matched the whole aura of the song completely). I liked how by the end of the song, the lyrics subtly change and the image of the snowflakes and flowers made it very realistic to me, it drew a picture in my head every time I listened to it.",

            "answer_text": "I like quite a few: Not in any order because I can't really rank them. Idol: This one gets its own section. I actually love Idol. It was actually the song that convinced me to stan BTS. Because I had heard their music before but I'm really picky and hard to impress. And older so I guess not everything appeals to me like before. A lot of people don't like it. And I personally judge them\u2026 Just kidding. I think what sold me was the performance. I think I saw the Tonight Show one and my first thought was \u2018pftt Kpop, been there done that. Don't these groups today have anything new--Is that? Are they doing African dance?!\u2019 Then I looked up the music video and the lyrics and was even more sold with the symbolism and the wordplay. A few hours and music videos later and I was a full fledged ARMY. First Love by Suga: This song is probably secretly my bias wrecker if my favorite song was a bias. I have been listening to rap since I was a child and I have never been more impressed with an idol rapper until Suga. Also I tend to be pretty cold when it comes to emotional songs and this one made me cry so\u2026 Sea: Where there is hope there is despair\u2026I don't really have words for how much I love this song so here's a heart \u2661 House of Cards: I get kind of annoyed seeing comments on how sexy the song is sometimes because that is all fans seem to comment on aside from the pretty awesome lyrics and genius composition and beautiful harmony. It's also not about what many fans think it is. There's nothing risque in those lyrics. Attack on Bangtan: It's like an anthem of fire and the best rookie level song to have on my playlist as I wash dishes. I Need U: I never get tired of this song Run: I also never get tired of this song 4\u2032O Clock: Taehyung\u2019s voice is so gorgeous and soothing and this song is the best song to listen to on the bus Ddaeng by the Rapline: The wordplay. I love it. Cypher 2 and 3 by the Rapline and Supreme Boi: Is fire. But seriously the wordplay. I'm in love. Adult Child by Suga and Jin: Extremely relatable War of Hormones: I admire how BTS were like we are idols and we like women here's a song about it. And I like how it's the most respectful song of its kind. Like a polite Baby Got Back. Mikrokosmos: This song is magic live. The Truth Untold: Friggin gorgeous song. The lyrics. The singing. The fact that it got my brother who is a textbook hipster who doesn't even like Kpop and is never impressed by any mainstream artists to go \u201cWow\u201d. Whalien52: It's a song about a lonely whale. And it's based on an actual species of whale and it's so sad and I just love it so much Singularity: Anytime Taehyung sings I am happy, but this is my favorite solo. Awake: Gives me hope. Lie: I find myself listening to this one a lot. Jimin's voice is really underrated here. Serendipity: Sounds even better live. Just One Day: For some reason my playlist always defaults to this song. And I'm okay with it. Bapsae: This probably my favorite social issues song Dope: I may or may not have this song on constant repeat Fake Love: At first I didn't like it. Now I don't know how many times I've played it. Spring Day: Is perfect. Danger: I don't know what it is but it's probably my most replayed song. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a few that I like. While BTS isn\u2019t my favorite group, I\u2019ve always liked their music, and so I\u2019m pretty familiar with all of them. The catchy tunes and the strong beats just get stuck inside your head before you know it. I think one of the reasons why they have such a huge fanbase is because they have genuinely good music. And unlike American pop (that\u2019s literally dying right now and is being overtaken by rap/hip-hop) they often have more variety to their melodies and beats. I\u2019ll leave that for now - I can save that part for another answer. And um, this my opinion, so make sure you don\u2019t get offended. Save MEfrom The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever - 2016 I think this has been my favorite song (at least by them) for a long time. No matter how many times I listen to it, I never get bored. At first, I just liked the sound of it - upbeat, amped, and danceable. Honestly, it sounded like any pop/k-pop song out there. However, when I read the lyrics, that was simply not the case\u2026 I\u2019d say the lyrics were darker than expected, not to mention depressing. But you know what? It resonated with me because that was when my PTSD/depression was starting to bloom. And the fact that I had something that I could connect with really moved me, and I liked the song even more. 2. Run from The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 - 2015 Again, depressing lyrics. But I liked the painful meaning behind it - it added more depth and meaning to the song. The song itself really gave off their vibes. The pace was slower than Save ME, and there was a wider range of notes. And boy was it intense. Overall, I think it was a very well-structured song with clever integration of rap. 3. Butterfly from The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 - 2015 This song used to make me almost cry. The tone felt bittersweet, which adds a whole new layer of sentimentality. It\u2019s a beautiful song (that deserved a music video). I found it really similar to Run though. It really depends on your taste which one you like better. 4. BTS Cypher PT.3:KILLER from Dark & Wild - 2014 This is my favorite cypher, as well as my 4th favorite BTS song. It\u2019s just fire. You can just tell by the first second. While the whole Dark & Wild album itself was pure gold (an incredible fusion of different genres), I just couldn\u2019t get over this song. THEY HAVE SKILLS. That\u2019s all I have to say. Rap line+Supreme Boi, well done. 5. House Of Cards from The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 - 2015 (full version: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever - 2016) Easily the best outro. The strings in the background create a dramatic mood and the vocals really stand out as opposed to a more instrumental based song like Blood Sweat & Tears. Each part really suited the members, although Jin and V should\u2019ve gotten more lines. If you\u2019re into fanfiction, House Of Cards is a great one. Check it out. Some songs that need to be mentioned: Rain - from Dark & Wild - 2014 Epiphany - from Love Yourself: Answer - 2018 Lie - from Wings - 2016 Serendipity - from Love Yourself: Her - 2017 (full version: Love Yourself: Answer - 2018) Interlude: Wings - from Wings - 2016 The Last - from/by Agust-D - 2016 Of course, this is my personal list, and I only wrote those that were my real favorites. Some of these songs are really underrated, so I hope people will take notice of these amazing songs. ",

            "answer_text": "I can't say that I have a one and only favorite that I place on a pedestal higher than everything else, so I'm going to name a few. I Need U (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever) This one really turned my head when I first heard it and I have never stopped loving it since. I feel like the sadness and melencoly vibes of a breakup are so well captured in this beautiful track. If you listen closely to the tech-drop, you can hear faint breathing, or panting in the back, and this just reminds me of how it's so hard to breath and find peace with yourself when you've lost the one you love and ultimately, need. A lot of times people overlook I Need U and call it overrated, but I can tell you there has never been a song that has exceeded this one since the album was released.Dimple/Illegal (Love Yourself Her) The lyrics are along the lines of \"These dimples are illegal, so I'll call you Illegirl\". Like, oh my gosh whoever came up with that is a complete genius! I love Dimple/Illegal for it's insanely clever use of lyrics and also for the way it describes being in love and not being able to handle when he/she smiles and laughs. I feel this way all the time when my crush smiles and I honestly wish I could tell him to stop and that it kills me every time. A lot of people feel this way when the person they love is laughing or smiling, and it's just this overwhelming joy that is inside you that the boys sing about in this track.Converse High (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever) As far as this song goes, it's mainly about how the guy is in love with the girl and how she always wears her Converse sneakers. Me, as a high school girl, I also really love Converse and I also love it when the guy I like wears his too. I just really think that this song can be related to by so many people, because it's so true that when he/she wears a certain thing, it makes you fall for them that much more. I also love the fact that when the boys sing this song, it takes me back to when they were little and just starting out. It gives me the ultimate 2014 Bangtan Boys vibes.Fake Love (Love Yourself Tear) This is the brand new one everyone is talking about. I am especially in love with the rock mix, and it\u2019s seriously amazing. I think for me, the boys really showcase their maturity and growth in this track, and I am so proud of them and how far they\u2019ve come. Fake Love also really reflects on how devastating it is to realize that the relationship you are in is all a lie. They really show how lost you can feel and how unsteady you are after being cheated on or played with. I think this is really clever of the to put out such a serious album after Love Yourself Her which was more bouncy and about lighter topics. I admire the contrast they went for and I know that they gave their all to this song.Begin (Wings) As a Jungkookie biased ARMY, I\u2019m not only putting this one on the list because my Kookie sings it, but also because it tells of how much the members influenced him and helped him blossom into the man he is today. This is a beautiful topic for the maknae of the group, seeing as he was so young when they first debuted. Jungkook says that because of the members, \u201cNow I\u2019m me. You make me begin. Smile with me. Cry with me. Fly with me.\u201d This is so amazing and it just brings tears to my eyes to hear of how much Jungkookie appreciates his hyungs. They really truly helped him bloom, and this is one of the best topics BTS has ever sang about.",

            "answer_text": "i\u2019m not a big army but i do know quite a few side tracks and title tracks dope this song really like SO GOOD, jungkook\u2019s \u2018ayo ladies and gentlemen\u2019 and jin\u2019s part will forever make me crazy. This is also the song that made me slowly got into BTS(the bit at 0.46 lowkey sounds like namjoon shut up, im sorry)  im fine I only recently listened to this but its GOOD, LIKE CRAZY GOOD. they made it AMAZINGLY GREAT. I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW AMAZINGLY AMAZING THIS SONG IS  save me so obviously i\u2019m fine and save me have the same melody so obviously i would like both. this song could have been the song that might have made me an ARMY last year(2018) cause i listened to this song and i was like yo this is seriously good. like YO, but then yeah stuff happened i was unable to understand the world of kpop. this is one of my favourite songs that i really love from BTS and will have a special part of my heart  magic shop this is also another new song that i recently listened to. I have noticed a lot that quora armys really like this song(at least the ones i have seen around). and so i decided to listen to it. IT IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL OF PERFECTION. V at the start, like he killed me at the very beginning. i believe that jungkook wrote the lyrics. i am not someone who is going through anything but anyone who is, hope you listen to this and smile and cry at the same time. it really is beautiful. it truly is art on another level  best of me just like magic shop and im fine, this is a song that i only recently got into. but do i care. no. jimin at the start like YO, this is just like every other song is ART AND THE PERFECTION OF THE SONG IS OVER THE ROOF.  home MY FAVOURITE ON MAP OF THE SOUL: PERSONA. I WANNA GO TO MI CASA, EVEN THOUGH I AM CURRENTLY AT MI CASA WRITING THIS RIGHT NOW. okay but seriously the song is truly amazing, and i really love the song  dna okay i haven\u2019t been listening to this song as much as the others. but before i discovered those songs i nearly always listened to dna  epiphany one of my favourite solos, jin is beautiful and he knows it but i hope he knows that his voice is just as beautiful. its also my favourite solo song from all the solo stuff bts does  euphoria there was a moment in my life when i was OBSESSED with this song. it gave me euphoria while i listened to it  seesaw . oh my god. i was so surprised when i first listened to it. my reaction: IS SUGA SINGING? it\u2019s a beautiful song that i really do love just like the other songs on the list. i\u2019m so sad that this song didn\u2019t get it\u2019s own MV cause it is a beautiful song  people say that love at first sight doesn\u2019t exist, i agree but love at first listen DOES EXIST. IT EXISTS FOR ALL THESE SONGS. go listen to all these songs and go stream cause these boys are freakin talented and deserve all the love that they have so why not give them more :) hope you have euphoria while being at home but you probably experienced an epiphany just then cause you\u2019re actually at the magic shop that sells seesaws and its super dope. its a place that shows the best of me and now i know my dna and the person there said \u2018save me\u2019 but and i was like are you okay and then they said \u2018im fine\u2019 even though they are clearly not.(wow i didnt no that it was gonna end so depressing) I hope you guys have a nice day, BE HAPPY, LISTEN TO BTS IF YOU ARE SAD LISTEN TO BTS IF YOU ARE HAPPY LISTEN TO BTS IF YOU ARE MAD LISTEN TO BTS IF YOU ARE ANGRY LISTEN TO BTS IF YOU ARE ANNOYED IN CONCLUSION, LISTEN TO BTS IF YOU FEEL EMOTIONS ANYWAYS Hope you feel a sense of euphoria after reading this,the kpop industry is a bad industry but there will always be great people in it. stay safe and healthy cause bts wants you to be safe and healthy nah im kidding hope you guys do actually stay safe and healthy, if you are a student like me, dont stress about school and if you are LISTEN TO BTS IF YOU ARE STRESSED BECAUSE OF SCHOOL okay goodbye, life is amazing and just like jin said \u2018 I'm the one I should love in this world \u2019 okay im actually gonna go now so yeah byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ",

            "answer_text": "LONG ANSWER AHEAD\u2026\u2026\u2026. I think that you should listen to as many songs as possible by yourself and decide for yourself because different people have different taste in music. So what I think is the best, might not even make it in you top 10. I will go by the album and release dates ( I haven\u2019t mentioned all the songs but only my picks from each album)- 2 COOL 4 SKOOL: Released on June 12 2013, it had a total of 9 songs. As you might already know that BTS was meant to be a Hip Hop group so their debut album was purely dedicated to this genre. No more dreamWe are bulletproof pt. 2I like itInterlude - fun fact: RM used this to make Monterlude in his mixtape. you can give it a try too.\u2018O!RUL8,2?\u2019 : Released on 11 sept 2014. Overall it had 10 tracks. I honestly like this album better than their debut album. This album showcased their versatility but this was just the start. N.OIf I ruled the worldAttack on BangtanCoffee - ok i did not like it at first but now i listen to it very often.Cypher pt. 1 - RM\u2019s rap speaks to me.Skool Luv Affair : Released 12 feb 2014. Had a total of 10 tracks. Boy In Luv - The lyrics are about the typical school crush. Though I usually HATE such songs no matter how cool they are but i somehow LOOOVE this one.Just One Day - I like this song the best among the 10 tracks on this album. This was one of the songs that made me join the fandom.TomorrowJumpCypher pt. 2Miss right - This was on the special edition album released on may 13 2014Dark and Wild : Released on August 19 2014, it consisted of total 14 songs. I like all of them, specially Rain. DangerWar of HormoneRainCypher pt. 3Second grade - just don\u2019t take Bang it otherwise\u2026 the song is fun to listen to24/7 = HEAVEN - Not a lot of people will recommend this, but give it a try.The Most Beautiful Moment In Life Pt.1: April 29 2015. This album is often considered as a turning point in their career. I need U scored them their first win and these kings have not been defeated since then. I Need UBoyz With FunDope - I love the choreo for this oneHold Me TightConverse High - Not in my favorite list but you might like it.For You : japanese album. It has only 3 tracks if i remember it right. The single For You is still one of my all time favorites. It is cute and soothing. The Most Beautiful Moment In Life Pt.2: November 30 2015. This album had a really different impact at least for me. Run made me think of BTS in a whole new way. The symbolism they used and the stories they wanted to say , I could relate to them all. This album is closest to my heart. I often listen to this album on repeat when i am sad. RunButterflyWhalien 52Dead leavesMa cityHouse of cardsCrow-titThe Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Young Forever: this was packed with remixes and full length editions of their previous songs. but it included FIRE, SAVE ME and EPILOGUE: Young Forever\u2026. WINGS: Just listen to the complete album.. All 15 tracks are WOW.. it had a solo song for each member and every single one of them was amazing. I specially like Begin, Reflection and Awake. Begin - JungkookLie - JiminStigma - VFirst Love - SugaReflection _ RMMAMA- J-hopeAwake - JinBSTlostCypher pt. 4Am i wrongTwo!Three!You Never Walk Alone: Released on feb 13 2017\u2026 It also had a lot of songs fro previous albums but in addition to that- Spring DayNot TodayLove Yourself: Her :Released sept 18 2017.

BTS is going to release their next album in November this year which is titled \u2018BE\u2019 Apart from this members of BTS have many individual songs too. V- Winter Bear, Scenery, Sweet Night, even if i die its you (with jin) Suga - He goes by the name AGUST-D.. He released his first mixtape in 2016 and second one recently.. my picks are- agust-d, The Last, So far Away, Daechwita, 28, people, Strange, Set me free, Dear my friend. RM- I believe, Throw away, Monster, Life, everything goes, forever rain, Daeng (rap line), 4 o\u2019 clock (with V), moonchild, satoori rap ( with bts) J-hope - Piece of peace, Day dream, Hope world, Boy meets evil, airplane.

            "answer_text": "Here are a list of my 5 types of songs: Soul Songs: Just those songs that sings with the melody of your soul, the everlasting heartbeat pounding in your chest, and the rhythm and feeling of euphoria. Mic Drop (Steve Aoki Remix) - I don\u2019t know how to explain this song. It\u2019s gorgeous, never-tiring, and please\u2026 listen to it everyday for good grades and mental health. The beat is the melody of my heart.Idol - it\u2019s the pounding of your heart. The side of you that gives the middle finger and no f*cks about anything. It\u2019s the side that tells everyone else that you love yourself, which is what makes you superior to everyone else.Heart Clenchers: The songs that have a melody, lyric, and tune that makes your heart clench and your soul melt. The songs that make your heart beat faster but slows time down. Jamais Vu - This was the song that absolutely shocked me. \u2018Remedy\u2019 and \u2018melody\u2019 are the most beautiful rhymes that sing with the soul of each member of BTS. Their careers, their futures, their remedy, our remedy\u2013 all come from our fandom\u2019s melody, and the music that they put their soul in.Heartbeat - this was an obvious one. This song reminds me of those angst romance fanfics I used to read (and still do) about heartbreak, death, cheating and above all else\u2013the heart clench and rhythm of one\u2019s heart while they are feeling and bearing pain. The lyrics are absolutely magical.Serendipity - my heart song. The song that my heart sings with whenever I heart it. The voice and lyrics that draw back and forth like the waves and the moon.Love Maze - borderline sexy voice\u2026?Freeing Melodies: The melodies that set you free with the song\u2019s very soul. Epiphany - \u201cI\u2019m the one I should love\u201d sung in a chorus, in a stadium of 40,000 ARMY, all united to support seven boys, their dreams, their career, their music, and their emotional lifelines that they portray through their voices and melodies\u2013 tell me that isn\u2019t the most beautiful thing in the universe. Whoever mentioned Epiphany on Instagram, I applaud you for doing so. There\u2019s nothing like \u201cI\u2019m the one I should love\u201d being sung at the Rose Bowl Stadium, nothing like the echo though the conjoining hearts of us all in the world, nothing like beauty in loving ourselves through the music BTS connects us with.Let Go - the most beautiful melody in the entire universe.Bangtan Bops: The songs that you will never let go because they are forever the head boppers of the music industry. Trivia: Just Dance - that bop that your body will always move to.Ma City - sung from the soul of each member.Crowd Chanters A little bit of generic tunes, but still amazing nevertheless.

            "answer_text": "I would say IDOL and Spring Day. Spring Day was one of the most meaningful songs to me. The song pays homage to the victims and survivors of the Sewol Ferry Incident, an incident that remains a scar to many Koreans to this day. I am actually the age of the high school students who comprised the majority of the victims of this incident. The fact that they could have been my friends one day if it wasn\u2019t for that incident hurts me. Every time I think of the incident makes bitter, sad, and hateful. I\u2019m sure quite a lot of Koreans are like me in regards to that incident because not only are they fellow Koreans but they\u2019re someone\u2019s children, grandchildren, and friends. In a Confucianist society like Korea, that sentiment is especially strong. The song soothes that part of bitterness and sadness. The song Spring Day not only pays homage to the victims but also soothes the pain of people in regards to that incident.  I liked IDOL (without Nicki Minaj featuring, not that I don\u2019t like her but I found her featuring to be unnatural. It didn\u2019t quite fit in well.) because not only were the lyrics meaningful, but also it had good strong beats and was more \u2018Korean\u2019 than other songs I\u2019ve heard. It had this thing I would call the Korean \u2018\ud765\u2019 (pronounced \u2018heung\u2019). \ud765 generally means the idea of being in joy/having a good time but often associated with music. It\u2019s that feeling of you wanting to move your body in response to a song. Traditional Korean music would often have a strong beat as we often use traditional drums called \ubd81 and people would say \uc5bc\uc464 (a phrase included in IDOL) whilst dancing to the rhythm. IDOL is a modern version of typical traditional Korean music. Their choreography also incorporates some traditional Korean dance. (http://korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=162979) ",

            "answer_text": "Originally Answered : Which BTS song do you never get tired of? Depends on my mood. But in general, I can never get sick of these songs : Outro: Tear (RM, Suga, j-hope) There\u2019s just so much emotion, so much pain, so much heartache behind this song. As many of you may know, Yoongi wrote this song during one of the toughest times for BTS. The group was seriously considering disbanding, and when he played the song for the other members, they cried together. Whenever I feel down, I listen to this song, and it actually helps me feel better. If BTS, one of the biggest groups in the world, was able to get past their stress and anxieties to work together and succeed, I can too. Go Go Although a lot of people dislike this song, I actually find it addictive to listen to. As you can see in the picture, I loved the Halloween dance practice to Go Go almost as much as the song, haha. The melody and lyrics might sound meaningless and unvarying, but it has an important message behind it \u2014 how this generation is hyping and following the YOLO concept without actually thinking things through. They blow their money and time on useless things instead of appreciating and focusing on what\u2019s actually important. Essentially BTS was mocking young people today about wasting the most precious thing \u2014 youth. Love Maze The rapping was immaculate. Vocals were amazing. I would consider it one of BTS\u2019 more underrated songs. It\u2019s vaguely in the center in the spectrum, maybe leaning more towards the underrated side. But I like it. A lot. There\u2019s something about BTS\u2019 love songs that are less cheesy and generic compared to other K-pop songs. It has some kind of message, theme, or significance behind it that takes awhile to understand. Epilogue: Young Forever Another tear-evoking HYYH song. I know the lyrics are \u2018forever, we are young\u2019, but there might be something else. BTS has been around for 7 years. I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s a long period of time. It feels especially long if you experience the amount of hate and negativity BTS receives every day. Still, they stick together, focus on the positive, and work their hardest to please the non-toxic, faithful ARMYs. To me, this song is their way of promising us, \u201cWe\u2019ll be with you forever. No matter what, we\u2019re here. Even if we disband and don\u2019t make music anymore, I hope that our 7 years of work in the music industry influences you and helps you.\u201d It could also just be a simple reminder from BTS telling us to never let go of our youth. Make the most of it. Be happy with what you are and what you have. Keep chasing your dreams and never give up. That sounds cliche but sometimes you forget the most important reminders. everythingoes (RM, NELL) This song hit me right in the feels the moment I heard it for the first time. I can\u2019t get over Namjoon\u2019s soothing, raspy-ish voice. The lyrics sort of repeated itself, but still. It just sounds so good, I don\u2019t know what else to say haha. Friends (Jimin, V) Ahhh!! I can\u2019t explain how much I love this song! The beat, the melody, the lyrics, the perfect harmonies, everything. Taehyung and Jimin\u2019s vocal range and tone are basically opposites, so they sound so heavenly together! This has to be one of my favorite BTS duets.  That\u2019s all! This has been in my drafts for at least a week, but what can you expect from me? goodbye, adios, hasta la vista, au revoir, peace. \u27b6\u27b6*\u2022\u2661 \ud83c\udd33\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd34 \u2661\u2022*\u27b7\u27b7 ",

            "answer_text": "One main reason why I appreciate BTS is because they don\u2019t narrow down their lyrical scope to the few usual topics like love, heartbreak, girls and parties. If you single out any album from their discography, its evident how different one song is from the other in terms of sound, lyrics and theme. There are plenty of songs which touched me, inspired me and left me in awe. So I\u2019m just gonna list out a few: Epiphany: Where do I even start describing this song. I was waiting for the Jin solo intro for ages and it turned out to be hauntingly beautiful. I felt this final intro for Love Yourself series was so suitable because he finally realizes that he wants to love himself first. (Go check out the MV as well as fancams of him singing this live. Jin is a gem.) \u201cIt's so odd, I loved you so much for sure I adapted myself entirely to you, I wanted to live for you But as I kept doing so, I became unable to bear the storm inside my heart I got to fully reveal my true self under the smiling mask I'm the one I should love in this world The shining me, the precious soul of mine I realize only now, so I love me Though I'm not perfect, I'm so beautiful I'm the one I should love. \u201d  Spring Day: This song makes me feel happy and sad at the same time. Beautiful tune. Sad lyrics. There's melancholy in their voices while expressing the desperation and longing for that special someone. Adding to this is the beautiful mv with rich imagery and pastel colors. There are theories about how this song might be about the Sewol ferry disaster. Definitely feels more than just a simple love song. \u201cThe morning will come again Because no darkness, no season Can last forever.\u201d  Spine Breaker: I know, it's hard to actually take this song seriously after that ridiculously hilarious music video that the boys made (genius choreography) but the lyrics are pretty cool because they talk about how the society works these days. \u201cThe class system of the 21st century is divided into two: Those who have and those who haven\u2019t Those who wear the shoes and those who don\u2019t Those who have the clothes and those who don\u2019t And those who try hard to get those things Even after seeing your parents\u2019 curved spines, you\u2019re so cold-hearted You complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you (Ayo baby) stop being so immature You won\u2019t freeze just because you don\u2019t have that jacket Fill your head with good sense before it\u2019s too late Some of us can.\u201d  Tomorrow: This song talks about how there may be hurdles thrown in your path to success and how you might be disheartened by that but you gotta keep moving on. I love how all these songs about struggles to succeed in life comes from their own struggles. \u201cFollow your dream like breaker. Even if it breaks down, Don\u2019t ever run backwards, never. Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest.\u201d  Paradise : I love how they assure you that it's okay to not have a big dream. Even if you don't make it big, you are unique. \u201cWho says a dream must be something grand?Just become anybodyWe deserve a lifeWhatever, big or small, you are you after all.\u201d  Wings: Another underrated song which compares career to having wings. \u201cMy back hurting is for my wings to come out I believe in you, even if things are bleak right now The end will be great Fly, fly up in the sky Fly, fly get \u2019em up high It\u2019s the path you chose, dude don\u2019t be scared This is just the first flight\u201d  Love Myself : A feel good song which makes you happy. Beautiful harmonies. Great lyrics \u201cLoving myself might be harderThan loving someone elseLet\u2019s admit itThe standards I made are more strict for myselfThe thick tree rings in your lifeIt\u2019s part of you, it\u2019s youNow let\u2019s forgive ourselvesOur lives are long, trust yourself when in a maze When winter passes, spring always comes.\u201d  Love(RM) : I LOVE play on words. And Namjoon is the master of word plays (Saram-Sarang). \u201cI just feel it Like the moon rises after the sun rises Like how fingernails grow Like trees that shed their bark once a year That you are the one who will give meaning to my memories Who will make a 'person' into 'love' Before I knew you My heart was filled with straight lines only I'm just a human, human, human You erode all my corners And make me into love, love, love\u201d  Cypher, Ddaeng: Savage BTS pumps me up. Makes me wanna work hard and flex on haters like they are doing it at the moment. Their glow up is so inspiring. \u201cThe sound I\u2019m making right now, baeIs all dog noise to someone, baeYou should change your bashing pattern, baeIt\u2019ll start to get boring, boring baeI don\u2019t dislike you anymoreI don\u2019t dislike you anymore, sorry baeI\u2019ll be the drum, just hit me hardLet\u2019s just try it, samulnori, baeI\u2019m a monster, my tail is too long, baeYou\u2019ll shoot me anyway, baeIn that case, a zoo would be more comfortable, baeYou want it too, something to chew on, baeEven if you don\u2019t like me, you know meEven if you don\u2019t like me, you know meI like hate comments more than no commentsI don\u2019t know youBut you know my name I love I love I love myself\u201d (Cypher pt. 4) \u201cFace that fell asleep after eating ramen ddaengDregs do your thangLook at me I'm your errthangYou're dope? Cool? RidiculousThere is no uh- ridiculousEven if I st-st-stutter my wordsI h-hope you understandI la-la-lack a way with wordsBu-but I try to speak correctly but my mouth keeps ge-ge-getting crookedBecause I li-li-li-like it I li-like it very muchRappers who don't even have haters, shut upWhere are you haters?Look into this mirror after washing your eyes and faceThere is a hater of yours breathing right in thereWe celebrate rather than being celebsOnly accel no breakWho are you to recognize meFrogs who live up to your nameI hope you die in that wellI'll pray earnestlyDdaeng\u201d (Ddaeng)  There are many other songs with great lyrics. This list could be pretty long. These are just a few songs I admire (no particular order). Do give bts a chance. They're more than just \u201cTop social artists\u201d and \u201cpretty Korean boys who dance well\u201d. ",

Overall, great song.  4: Young Forever This is a great song with a great message. I gotta admit, I got teary eyed for quite a few times after listening to this song. I\u2019m someone who usually gives up easily, even though it gives me many regrets. This song always helps me when I feel helpless and gives me hope of actually starting to do something I loved.  3: Spring Day This was the song that made me want to learn their names and enter the Kpop world. At first, I just liked the melody and the visuals. Soon after reading the English translations, and seeing multiple articles written about the meaning behind this song made me love this song even more. My grandma had just passed away as I found this song. With the lyrics surrounding the idea of missing someone whom we lost really helped me heal.  2: Epiphany When this song came out, the lyrics really touched me. During that time, I was having trouble with telling myself that I was worth it, that I was enough for my family and the world. Every-time I listen to this song, I always tell myself to remember to love myself first if I\u2019m loving someone right now (LOL Namjoon\u2019s UNICEF speech). Also, with Jin being my bias kinda helped with this high ranking ;P  (HOW IS HE THAT BEAUTIFUL) 1: Intro: Never Mind This song is SUPER UNDERRATED in my opinion. When I first found this song, I was trying really hard to push myself to do something that my parents wanted me to do and I was becoming more and more depressed and even had some thoughts that wasn\u2019t so great. Whenever I felt like I couldn\u2019t do it, I would listen to this song to comfort myself. These two lines hit me the most: \u201cIf you feel like you are going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re too young and immature to give up, you idiot. Never Mind\u201d  (Eventually my parents saw that I was NOT happy and started to understand how I was feeling mentally\u2026 So I had quit the thing I was dreading to stop doing) So Here\u2019s my list:) I could go on but I\u2019d like to keep my answer relatively short ",

I\u2019m seriously a total die-hard fan of their older works and I don\u2019t like Love Yourself/Wings\u2026 THAT much so not many of their songs will be here. (sorry) Tomorrow, Skool Luv Affair - The lyrics are so beautiful, yet relatable.Cypher Pt. 2, Skool Luv Affair - Roasts everywhere!! The beat is so good and the rapline are all so raw and powerful here.Cypher Pt. 3, Dark & Wild - THIS SONG GOT ME INTO BTS NOT EVEN JOKINGRain, Dark & Wild - I love the jazzy sort of instrumental??

            "answer_text": "It really depends on your style of music. If you are looking for recommendations\u2026 I have a lot of older songs - because those ones are the best ones for me. Blood Sweat and Tears I Need U - one of my all time favorite songs Save Me - filmed in one take - one of my favorite songs of all time too Run - I love this song so much. Lost - Vocal Line song Like It Part 2 - probably my most favorite song from BTS even though it is in Japanese Autumn Leaves - this song has a special place in my heart - my love for it is tremendous Tomorrow - this song is super special to me - I always listen to it whenever I feel stressed because it motivates me to keep going, even if I want to give up, just keep going - little by little, it will get better. Baepsae - This song is also one of my favorites, the beat is so hype that just makes me want to dance along 21st Century Girl - Us girls need our motivation - we are tired of being discouraged for our looks and personality. If I don\u2019t feel confident in myself, this song is what makes me proud of being a girl and accepting that I am beautiful in my own way. Cypher Part 4 - How could not mention the best songs and not include Cypher Part 4 - if you feel savage, this is the SONG. Feel proud about who you are and love yourself. You might be wondering why I didn\u2019t include many title songs. I love the title songs too, but the other tracks in the albums are what get to me the most. They are motivating, relatable, and calming to my heart. If you want to go through the whole BTS experience, I would suggest that you should listen to all their albums (there is not that many) and pick out what moves you. Don\u2019t listen to me much because these are solely my opinion, but try to take a listen to the tracks I linked and listen to their albums on Spotify. There are a bunch of great songs that I didn\u2019t include but you might find to like them. Go ahead\u2026 Take a listen.      <333 ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m later than the White Rabbit, but it had to be said. My favourite BTS song is, without a doubt, Spring Day. Not only the meaning behind the song, and the song itself, but how the song affected me. There isn\u2019t much to say, honestly. Wait no, I take it back, let me tell you my life story. The person who introduced me to BTS in late 2018 is a huge ARMY, and this was their favourite song. They\u2019re my best friend and so, me being cheap and not wanting to buy an actual present (yay), decided to learn this \u2018dumb Korean song\u2019 for their birthday, and I would sing it to them. Okay so iT wAs A LoT HaRdEr ThAn i ThOUgHt. As a person who somewhat despised K-pop at the time (yes, \u2018the boys wear so much makeup, they all look the same, ew\u2019), it was only my dedication to my friend that kept me from playing Subway Surfers on my phone on our 6-hour road trip. Lol after six hours, I could barely memorize the chorus, let alone the rest of the song, WHAT A FAILURE. Anyway so my friend\u2019s birthday came around, and I dragged them to a corner and sang the stupid song, really quietly so nobody could hear except them. They were really happy (which made up for the horrible embarrassment I had suffered). They asked me to do one more thing for their birthday (WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT), which was to listen to 3 other BTS songs. So came along Idol, Go Go, and DNA. Anyway, needless to say, after a few months I was an ARMY. Not warm-blooded or cold-blooded, ARMY-blooded. I lived BTS. Looking back, it was kinda creepy lol. And in summer 2019, I realized BTS and Blackpink were not the only K-pop groups. And I became a multi-stan. And now, BTS has a very special place in my heart. Spring Day has an even more special place in my heart. They may never be my absolute and only favourites again, but they were the first ones. Okay this got way deeper than I thought.  The morning will come again. No darkness, and no season, is eternal. ~Spring Day TL;DR: My ARMY BFF introduced me to BTS and Spring Day, I fell into the K-pop hole, I will never be the same. Okay lol stay safe, happy, and healthy, and I\u2019ll see you soon <3 ",

            "answer_text": "So, it is really hard to choose a favorite BTS song in my opinion, because they tend to bring out new sounds and lyrics in their songs, catching everyone by surprise constantly. What I CAN do however, is talk about my top 8 songs (No Particular Order) Young Forever - Run BALLAD MIXI can\u2019t begin to tell you how much i play this song on repeat. I love the classical instruments used, I love RM and J-Hope singing, I love V\u2019s husky voice with the violin. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that Jimin and Jungkook\u2019s voices in the hook was so lovely together, and the background vocals, but it\u2019s definitely an all time favorite. 2. Serendipity (Full Length + Original) This was the music video that made me a Jimin-stan in the first place (Believe it or not, I used to be down for V). His voice just sounded so angelic and soft with the music, it\u2019s so soothing. The music vidoe was so aesthetically pleasing, with all the warm colors and the overall softness with amazing to watch. I honestly did not think I needed a full length, until I heard it however. Although the part does repeat in the beginning of the new addition, I really REALLY love the addition of the guitar. I think it really completes the soft aesthetic look as well as compliments his voice. And don\u2019t get me started on the new set of lyrics + a high note? Oh my G- 3. Trivia: Seesaw THIS IS MY BOP, I SWEAR ON THE HEAVENS! I was very surprised to hear this coming from Yoongi, but let me tell you my ears were absolutely blessed. Not only was he singing (Whoever says that he can\u2019t sing, post up), his voice giving me the chills, but the music and his rap style was amazing as well. But I think personally the highlight of the song was not from Yoongi, but from the BigHit female producer, Adora (even tho I originally thought the female voice was Jimin, oof). Her voice is absolutely beautiful, and with her little notes in the background of Yoongi\u2019s voice, it\u2019s so PRETTY. I find myself replaying her parts alot, it\u2019s so lovely to listen too. 4. Blood Sweat & Tears Don't get me started on their outfits. The whole Wings Era was just downright sexy, and I just ugh-. Anyways, I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jimin\u2019s first step of verses in the song, because he just sounds so graceful and pretty. I enjoyed J-Hope alot as well in that MV as well as musically. Not mention that lovely climax by Jin. 5. FAKE LOVE Originally, I did like the song, but not as much as I do now. Not only was the MV dark and dreary to show their angst, but the vocals and dance moves were on it too. V\u2026.V in the beginning, oh my god. His voice was so haunting and deep and I was just in love. Main Manz Jin had so many lines, I was really crying for him. I REALLY LOVED HOBI\u2019S VERSE THO, I loved the tempo to it and how spaced out it was. The dancing on it too was really great and on point. 6. 134340 (Pluto) Arguably, this might be my favorite BTS song of all time currently. I am a typically lyric junkie, so if you use metaphors to describe something and it makes sense? Yeah, you\u2019ve probably caught my attention. Not only was the concept of Pluto being used as a metaphor for love, but the singing was so great as well. I especially really like Jungkook\u2019s little voice jumps in the hook, it just sounds so good. The music is so jazzy and just really gives me good vibes. Not to mention Yoongi\u2019s legendary rap with the phone call. 7. House of Cards This song is like sex to my ears. It\u2019s so jazzy and deep, it\u2019s hard to explain the sound for me. Not only did my boy Jimin have alot of lines, they really used his voice well with the blending of the other vocals too. Jin saying \u201cNo way, Now way..\u201d and I\u2019m like, Yes there is no way you can be so talented. Or when Jungkook says \u201c\u2026Slow Down\u201d in the beginning of the climax ( and to whoever did the little \u201cAhhs\u201d in the back, you\u2019re freaking amazing) I was just really shooketh. 8. Butterfly (Original + Prologue Mix) It\u2019s just a calming song, I don\u2019t know why, it just is. I love how light their voices in this, it\u2019s just nice and soft. \u201cIs it true? Is it true?\u201d (Favorite Lyrics of the song). I really love the remix too, it was an interesting sound and it was just so calming. ",

            "answer_text": "BTS discography is so rich and they have jewels hidden in it. I love many songs of BTS. Their songs are inspirational and the meaning is out of the box. I can connect to their songs easily. My 4 personal favourite songs which have my emotions connected to them : BUTTERFLY : This song is your expression to a suicidal person whom you love a lot. They are singing that they don't want to lose that person. Ever. Butterfly is fragile and they wish that losing you is just a fragile dream like a butterfly. GOGO : This fun song is highly misinterpreted song of BTS. This song is actually like a wake up call to the Procrastinators and today's young generation. They are indirectly taking a dig at those young people who only dream of becoming rich but don't work towards their goal cause their perception towards \u201cYou Only Live Once\u201d is completely wrong. So when they sing \u201cYOLO (x3) Ya\u201d, they are taking a dig at such people who only believe in YOLO but meanwhile spend their time partying and still ask for money. (This is a funny video of them dancing on GOGO song. If you have never watched it, do watch. But warning, it will make you lose your brain cells.) SERENDIPITY : This gender neutral song about expressing your love to your loved one. It was a serendipity that both of them fell for each other. Hence, it's not a coincidence that Universe has brought them together because they were meant to be together. This song is calm and lyrics are beautiful. You would be left with a warm fuzzy feeling after listening to this one\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0f I Need You : This song has 2 meanings. The most renowned talks about the difficulties you face when you enter adulthood. While the latter one is about a boy who has just experienced break-up, but in the MV there is no sign of any girl. Interesting? This song is metaphorical. They used metaphors of a boy's break-up to describe the struggles of leaving youth phase and entering the adulthood. Bye \u2014 ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy, to pick only 10\u2026 well in no particular order but mostly ones I will always listen to. MIC Drop - I cant help but sing along and the best is one that puts you in a good mood.Blood Sweat & Tears - another song I love to sing along to. I can also see the MV in my head and I love it.Fake Love - such a good song and the MV is amazing, another one I see in my head as imksfening to the song, you have to sing song with this one too.Boy With Luv - this song is so catchy and we have Halsey in there too, I really love this one. It helps improve my mood if I\u2019m not all that happy.Dionysus - This one is so up tempo, be careful when you\u2019re driving and listening to it. This one has some good live performances and they do not fail to impress. The level of energy the maintain is impressive and the dancing is spot on.Make It Right - This song has such a nice, chill vibe to it, it makes me feel good. Easy to sing along to and get in the vibe with.Mikrokosmos- When they perform this in concert, it makes it all the more special. I love this song - shine, dream, smile. It\u2019s special.Euphoria - This one I like because of the best, it\u2019s super catchy and singing along? You can\u2019t help it. This is JK\u2019s solo song, he kills it.Epiphany - Oh Jin, this one is the first that made me cry. Because it talks about self love, it\u2019s veey deep and meaningful and beautiful.Serendipity - Jimin\u2019s solo - this song is so beautiful. Jimin and his vocals are what really make this song what it is, throw in his dancing skills and it\u2019s simply beautiful.Singularity - Oh my god on this one, V\u2019s voice is so smooth (mike butter), it\u2019s so beautifully done and then the MV\u2026 we can see his dancing and the amazing visuals (V\u2019s visuals too). This song is gorgeous.Seesaw - Suga\u2019s solo - this song is so good. He has this smooth as butter voice and it\u2019s such a nice chill song, it is hard to explain, but it\u2019s such a nice one to listen to. He\u2019s a rapper but his singing is something that should t be missed. He performs it so well. Love this song.Moonchild - RM sings this one, also a rapper but let me tell you, he sings really really well in this song. I put this on my sleep playlist because it\u2019s such a nice slow song. It\u2019s a beautiful slow jam.Tonight by Jin which was just released today (06/04/2019), it\u2019s about his pets and it\u2019s absolutely beautiful. I\u2019m so proud of him. \uc774 \ubc24 by JIN of BTSIdol, Fire, The Truth Untold.

They all have solos that you must listen to, they have slow songs that make you cry, that have up tempo songs that make you want to dance and put you in a good mood. They always put a lot of thought into what they are saying. The majority of their songs are deep and meaningful, they have a story to tell BTS knows what they\u2019re doing when they write their songs, they have something to say and they want you to listen. They always put a lot of thought into what they are saying. ",

            "answer_text": "Oou, I love this question. I would say\u2026. Spine Breaker. I don\u2019t know what it is about this song, but it makes me think about my mom and how she tries really hard to support my siblings and I. As a kid, I really took advantage of that. Fashion trends were kind of trashy back then. \ud83d\ude2c I really wanted a lot of things and didn\u2019t care how she got it. I just wanted it. It was a good thing that my mom didn\u2019t take BS from my siblings and I because she would put us in our place if we complained about wanting a certain item that was too expensive. Being older now, I\u2019m grateful that she told us that we couldn\u2019t get it because we had necessities. So all the money would go to the bills, food, transportation, essentials for school, etc. I didn\u2019t need that red lipstick, or that handbag as much as I needed our necessities. That doesn\u2019t mean that she didn\u2019t us stuff. We would often get surprised by her when she bought us fast food or got us nail polish or toys. I know it\u2019s not a lot but it really meant a lot to us at that time. And it because of that it taught me how to use my money on things that are important first and the extras would go to my own personal use. But on the other hand, there are kids or even adults who take advantage of them and learn later on. Or even worse, not at all. Spine breaker is really a good song about kids not being grateful about what their parents or guardians do for them. You\u2019re parents or guardians buy you all the things that you want but find out that it\u2019s just not enough. If they can get you this, then surely they can get you more. Then greed starts to set in, but you don\u2019t even notice. You want to be known as the one at school who\u2019s up to date on the fashion trend, turning a blind eye on the one who worked extra hours just to get you those things. \u201cWow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes\u201d That\u2019s the part of the lyrics that get to me the most. It can be the most expensive clothes from Gucci to whatever fashion brand and still be dirty. Why? Because if you look deeper and see the parent/guardian working extra hours just to give their kids the most nicest jewelry, outfits, etc. and then look at the child who knows how tired they are and yet still persists to get other expensive things. It\u2019s really hard, especially if you don\u2019t have a lot of money. \u201cYou can keep your swag on but how about your parents?\u201d Please be grateful to them. Show that you love them and care, it can go a long way. P.s Spine breaker is a song about kids who are not grateful to their parents. They can look at their curves spines and still want more from them despite them being tired. I just wanted to clarify, just in case someone misinterpreted what I was trying to come across. P.s.s I\u2019m sorry about my grammar and punctuation. It\u2019s my second time answering a question. What\u2019s your favorite BTS song and why? Please comment I would like to read your answers.  ~ Naoe is out. Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "It's hard for me to choose. I usually listen to their songs according to my mood. When I'm sad or just feeling a bit melancholic, I'll listen to Awake, First Love, and Stigma. When I need some energy, I'll listen to Fire, Dope, and Mic Drop. But when it comes to songs I can play anytime, I pick these: Rain: probably the most underrated song ever. I love the strong jazzy vibes and the sound of the pouring rain they put in it. The lyrics is also very relatable. BTS said that above all else, they are musicians. And I think this song explains it very well. They are basically saying that sometimes, musicians aren't always full of inspirations as it always seems. But somehow the lack of inspiration itself inspire them to create wonderful lyrics. I often think that this song is so sophisticated it doesn't sound very K-Pop to me at all.The Truth Untold: if you're familiar with the lyrics, I believe you understand. They made this song based on a story about a man in a castle who falls in love with a girl he sees plucking the flowers in his garden everyday for her to sell. He decided to plant the most beautiful flower ever so the girl can sell it for higher price but she never shows up the next day and he regrets his decision never to see her in person, because he believes that he's too ugly. The origin story is beautiful enough, but I strongly believe that this song is actually about the truth they couldn't tell the ARMYs: they could never show us their true side. As an idol, they're afraid their real self is \u2018too ugly' that it couldn't meet our expectations. But even so, they will always try their best to create \u2018the most beautiful flowers' (songs, music videos, albums) for us because they love us anyway. Feel free to cry.Sea: this song is particularly special because it's a hidden track, which means this song isn't listed in the original tracklist of Love Yourself: Tear, and can only be heard once you play the album until the very end. This song describes their fame as a sea; it's so beautiful that you think the abundance of water can wash away your thirst (a will to succeed, in this case), but once you got there, you realized that the more you drink, the thirstier you get. They also explain the struggles they have to face to get to this point in some less metaphorical words. I think it takes only the best lyricist to create such masterpiece.That's that, I hope I didn't just bore you with my long expositions. ",

My favorite song, like, not just in kpop. It means so much to me. And the choreo, goshhhh. This song is 10/10Boy in luv (IN luv, not with). I feel like I\u2019m picking one sibling over the other loool. I love boy with luv, it\u2019s amazing! But boy in luv will always have a special place in my heart. The bad boy + school concept is cool, the rap is slapping soo hard, vocals as well. But! The! Choreo! Is! The! Best! One! Ever!I\u2019m a sucker for rap line, so third place goes to outro:tear. They snapped on that one. They are singing ffs!!! RM goes offfff in the beginning, Suga takes over with those bars and J-Hope finish it with such a great flow. Love it.Boyz with fun. That song is so fun, you immediately get on a good mood while listening to it. And the chorus is so catchy, it\u2019s a song I\u2019d sing and full on dance to in the shower. That\u2019s the best way to describe it.2nd Grade!! Is! Freaking! Legendary! As well as boyz with fun, the chorus is so addictive, I will mumble the lyrics and melody from time to time, and the rap!! It\u2019s so swaggy (yup just came up with that word)Best Of Me. This one is so underrated!! It\u2019s so beautiful. The melody, the choreo.. but when Namjoon starts singing-ish rapping-Ish, I loose it every time. It\u2019s so good!Love vocal line. The seventh spot is for the one and only The Truth untold. They sound like angels I swear to god if I\u2019m in a sad mood I\u2019ll start crying listening to that song.MIC DROP. But it\u2019s the Steve Aoki remix. The original is okay, but it\u2019s AMAZING with the remix. The MV is so good. The song slaps. Don\u2019t know what more to say.The song has just been out for a few days but I have to include it, it\u2019s so freaking beautiful - heartbeat. When I heard it for the first time I thought I would cry, the instrumental works so well with their voices. And Tae in the beginning, ahhh. I\u2019m dead.I can\u2019t really decide on this one so I\u2019ll just insert some honorable mentions, legendary songs. QUEEN spring day, I NEED U, blood sweat and tears, EPIPHANY (stream epiphany cowards). And lights! I know it\u2019s in Japanese and not released yet but the teaser freaking snaps. I love it.",

            "answer_text": "LOL trust me love, I can never pick one even if my life depended on it - I love all their songs equally. However, if I had to tell you about my BTS music tastes, I would say I am more of a big fan of BTS\u2019s lyrics and how deep they can be. Furthermore, I am also more attracted to songs with deeper meaning and lyrics rather than stuff just like DNA or their more \u201cpop\u201d songs. You\u2019ll notice that a good portion of these songs have been rapped / produced by Namjoon and Yoongi, especially the latter for his deep and heartbreaking lyrics, whom has continued to inspire me daily. If I narrowed it down to one single playlist (in no particular order): \u2022The Last - Agust D \u2022First Love - Suga \u2022Truth Untold - BTS \u2022All Cyphers + Mic Drop (I like to refer to this as one series of songs) \u2022I Love You - Jin \u2022Tomorrow - BTS \u2022Run - BTS \u20222!3! - BTS \u2022Intro: Never Mind - BTS \u2022Epilogue: Young Forever - BTS \u2022So Far Away - Agust D \u2022Awake - Jin \u2022Reflection - RM \u2022Spring Day - BTS \u2022Outro: Tear - BTS \u2022Magic Shop - BTS \u2022Airplane Pt. 2 - BTS \u2022Anpanman - BTS \u2022Arirang - BTS cover \u2022Someone Like You - V cover \u2022Hug Me - V x JHope cover \u2022 4 o\u2019 Clock - V x RM cover \u2022Agust D - Agust D \u2022Born Singer - BTS \u2022Life - RM \u2022God Rap - RM \u2022Joke - RM \u2022Even If I Die, It\u2019s You - Hwarang OST - V x Jin \u2022Fake Love - BTS As of right now, if you asked me to pick 3 songs to forever listen on repeat, they would be: \u2022The Last - Agust D \u2022Truth Untold - BTS \u2022Spring Day - BTS Hope this helps! If you are a new ARMY, I highly suggest you listen to these songs, which more than also deserve the same hype as Fake Love. I stand firmly by the fact that Spring Day as well as the HYYH era deserve the same hype as our queen LY: Tear. Happy listening!

I just wrote them down whenever I thought of one I liked.] Examples include, but aren\u2019t limited to: N.O. [As I\u2019m a student, this song spoke a lot to me.]No More Dream [Claaaaassic.]Just One Day [Idk why but this song gives me nostalgia\u2026 which is funny considering how I became an ARMY circa one/two years (?) after it came out\u2026]Can You Turn Off Your Phone? [So underrated. So good. So applicable to today.]Converse High [SO CATCHY.]I Like It [BTS songs have a thing about getting stuck in your head. I like it.]Rain [Kind of emo vibes\u2026 really good!]For You [From a Japanese mini album\u2026 I don\u2019t understand the words but like\u2026 lyrically, it\u2019s so appealing. Also, JK looks particularly hot in it. ]2nd Grade [Not a lot of people know this song\u2026 but holy crap it\u2019s good!]Moving On [As someone who\u2019s moved a lot, this song was really relatable.]Let Me Know [Jimin\u2019s high note\u2026]Coffee [I don\u2019t even like coffee but I like it when this song comes on lol]Attack On Bangtan [This is a bop, and no one can convince me otherwise.]Jump [Very angsty\u2026 an all-around masterpiece.]Hold Me Tight [From I Need You era. In regards to the overall message of the song, it\u2019s similar to I Need You.]Outro: Love is Not Over [Ahhhhhhh this song makes me feel weirdly reminiscent.]Autumn Leaves [Listen to this and you\u2019ll get why it\u2019s on this list.]Young Forever [THE CHORUS AND THE RAP AND EVERYTHING MAKES ME FEEL SO ATTACKED I CAN\u2019T EVEN]House of Cards [No, guys, it\u2019s not about sex. It\u2019s about a doomed relationship.]\ud314\ub3c4\uac15\uc0b0 [Idk the title in English\u2026 I just find this song so funny\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s cause I\u2019m Korean.]2!3! [The WINGS era. Part of me still can\u2019t believe it\u2019s over\u2026\u3160\u3160\u3160]Pied Piper [I. Swear. I think everyone will agree with me when I say that this song is the nicest way ARMYs have ever been told to get a life. And by BTS, no less.]Lost [Vocal line killing it here.]First Love [My personal favorite of the the seven solo Wings era songs. Genius.]Epiphany [Because Jin? And sad lyrics?]Aaaaaand sorry this is getting long. I\u2019ll just end with my all-time favorite:SPRING DAY [I cry.]",

            "answer_text": "This is soooo hard. It\u2019s basically impossible for me to rank top 10 favorite BTS songs, but here are my top 10 songs in no particular order: Not Today - I first started listening to this song back in January 2018 and really fell in love with its strong beat (my favorite type of Kpop songs). The music video and choreo is also really cool. Fire - this is such an amazing dance bop and has a really cool rhythm. Mic Drop - I listen to the dance break (long) version of this song and I can never get over that part lol Anpanman - this is such a unique and upbeat song, and watching BTS\u2019 stage performance videos of this song just makes me love this song even more. Fake Love - previously I didn\u2019t love this song as much, but as I listen to it more I start to love this track more and more. This unique hit is the perfect combination of ballad rhythms and dance beats. I Need U - I remember Jimin saying that he really loves this song, and I really do love this ballad as well. There\u2019s so much emotion in this track and it\u2019s just such a powerful, beautiful song! Butterfly - who doesn\u2019t love deep, beautiful BTS ballads, right? This is another beautiful ballad by BTS and definitely underrated. Make It Right, Jamais Vu and Dionysus - I am still in deep love with BTS\u2019 latest EP, and these are my favorite 3 songs from MOTSP. I enjoy Make It Right\u2019s smooth R&B vibe, Jamais Vu\u2019s deep-meaning lyrics and rhythm, and Dionysus\u2019 unique beat. I\u2019m definitely missing out on some other amazing tracks by BTS (like their solo songs are so beautiful too\u2026), but these are my top 10 BTS songs :) ",

            "answer_text": "I can say that I\u2019ve heard almost all of Bangtan\u2019s songs. I played Superstar BTS religiously so If I\u2019m not familiar with any, it\u2019s probably their earlier work. Here it is: 5. Heartbeat I know, I know it\u2019s the most recent but I really loved this song. I\u2019ve been playing it on repeat since it came out and ofcourse you can hear it in the game. The lyrics are beautiful, the MV is beautiful, the song is just put well together. I like songs that get to me and this song really did. 4. Outro:Tear I\u2019m a rapline enthusiast and I can easily put every cypher and disses they made on this list but among all those Tear is my favorite. Just the emotion of the song makes you tear-up literally. It gave me goosebumps the first time I listened to it. I remember clearly, I was in the bathroom on my headphones and LY:Tear is in shuffle and this played, I felt it bruh, the sadness, the anger and I don\u2019t even understand korean. 3. 4\u2032oclock V, RM, thankyou for this. This is my song to my bestfriend. I don\u2019t even know how to describe how I feel about this song, I cried a couple of times listening to this. I didn\u2019t quite liked it when they sang it in vlive for their muster I think, I forgot which event. Then I saw the lyrics on YT and it\u2019s just beautiful. When RM said \u201cYes, we\u2019re living and dying at the same time\u201d I FELT THAT. 2. Spring Day Do I have to explain? It\u2019s their best title track ever. Best MV ever. One of the best choreos. Period. Spring Day stans show yourselves. 1.Reflection Still my all time favorite song. The way RM wrote it so beautiful especially the chorus, there\u2019s no lyrics it\u2019s just music but somehow it said a lot. Sometimes when I think about this song, I wanna go to Korea all of a sudden just to hug RM and say \u2018I know how you feel, I feel it too\u2019 I know, he\u2019s not that sad these days but depression and just the general feeling of sadness and being alone and finding it hard to love yourself is one of the worst feeling there is. Thankyou Namjoon for writing this. ",

            "answer_text": "My favourite BTS songs (in this order) are: Dope; DNA; Fake Love; Blood, Sweat and Tears; Run; War of Hormone; I Need U and Save Me. Dope - The overall feel of the song, and the fact that you get to hear a decent amount of each member\u2019s voice, makes it perfect for new ARMYs.DNA - I like this song because of the layers of voice shared between the members, you get to experience a range of pitches from each.Fake Love - The deep voices used in the chorus make it seem mysterious, before the pitch ascends into a higher state and they shoot into solo parts.Blood, Sweat and Tears - The high notes used here from the like of Taehyung and Jimin are balanced out completely by the deeper tones from the likes of Yoongi and Hoseok.Run - It\u2019s slow at first but gains speed as the song goes on, and the slower tempo combined with the variety of high and low pitches makes it a feelgood song.War of Hormone - It\u2019s one of the more comedic songs they\u2019ve made, talking about the struggles a teenage boy goes through during puberty when he starts to look at girls in a different perspective.I Need U - It\u2019s a slower song that portrays the relationship between a couple who have recently broken up, containing lines like \u2018I\u2019m sorry (I hate you), I love you (I hate you), Forgive me\u2019. The male is trying to win the woman back after he has been broken by the fall of the relationship.Save Me - Last but not least, this song is mostly higher tones but there are also deeper tone provided by the likes of Namjoon and Hoseok. It talks about someone who feels trapped in an eternal darkness and wants to be free, asking for someone\u2019s hands to save them from it.This was a list of my favourite BTS songs and what they mean.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for requesting my answer. Choosing a favorite song from BTS isn\u2019t just a black or white option because they have so many great songs. But I will try my best to narrow it down to 10. Tomorrow : This song helped calm me a lot during days wherein I was unemployed. I was feeling helpless and useless but this song was my comfort.Intro: Nevermind: My go-to confidence booster!Paradise: Such a nice song, talking about how to cherish life and take things slowly. Sometimes our ambitions for great things eat us and make us believe that we have to run as fast as others but that\u2019s not always the case. A dream is a dream whether it\u2019s not as big as how others see it.Let Me Know: It\u2019s a classic break up song but I love how the emotions were really riled up in one song. The lyrics and melody were very well made. Nothing but respect to Producer Min Yoongi.Spring Day: A nostalgic song about missing your loved ones. This song is one of their important songs. It\u2019s very meaningful and sad but beautiful.I Need U: This song is memorable because it\u2019s what converted me to be an ARMY.4 O\u2019Clock: Taehyung\u2019s voice is so good in here and one of the lyrics in Namjoon\u2019s rap \u201cWe\u2019re living and dying at the same time\u201d got me in so deep. I love listening to this especially on quiet nights.Move: Makes me super emotional, the way they described how moving from one apartment to another isn\u2019t just simply taking your stuff and leaving, it\u2019s also leaving behind all your emotional baggages to pursue bigger things. Who knew moving could be so deep.Born Singer: Namjoon\u2019s verse really gets me everytime. How he said he was afraid of not reaching people\u2019s expectations hit me so hard. The whole song is also very sad, this is BTS\u2019 reality when people barely paid attention to them and now look where they are now. I\u2019m so proud of them.We On: ARMYs who left the fandom because they say BTS got arrogant after they released \u201cMIC Drop\u201d have probably never heard this song in their whole \u201cARMY\u201d life. We On slaps and if people actually cared, BTS was always confident of their talent and skills whether before and now. Special Mention: Trivia: Seesaw, Epiphany, Lie, Magic Shop, The Last and Cypher Pt.2: Triptych. Anyway all BTS songs are good for me and it\u2019s just a matter of mood on which one I listen for today~ ",

            "answer_text": "I have quite a few favorites, so I\u2019ll choose the ones that pop into my head rn. I might add others later. (these are in no particular order) Baepsae / Silver SpoonThis song was actually one of my first BTS songs. I listened to it for the first time when I was first getting into k-pop. I had previously known BTS for songs like DNA or Boy With Luv, so I really enjoyed listening to Baepsae because of how different it was then what I had previously known. I love how the song\u2019s upbeat vibe is paired with the song\u2019s true meaning. It\u2019s just such a fun song to listen to when you\u2019re bored or something. It never gets old. 2. Pied Piper This song is an absolute masterpiece. I love how the message of the song came off as sort of comical at first, but they are showing genuine care, just in a different way than most artists would. This song never fails to put me in a good mood. I also love when Pied Piper is performed live because obviously them v o c a l s, but also because it just means even more when performed live for some reason. It just shows the bond that BTS and Armys have really well. Kind of like Young Forever. 3. Blood, Sweat, and Tears I love this song and the music video for it. I know it\u2019s quite a popular song, but I really enjoyed it. I really love the symbolism in the music video and the way the boys portrayed it, like most music videos. It\u2019s just that type of that just makes you want to dance. 4. Euphoria This song is just beautiful. Bang Chan described this song perfectly, so here\u2019s that.  Anyways, Euphoria is just the type of song that makes you feel happy. Jungkook\u2019s vocals are obviously perfection, and the lyrics are so pretty. It inspires me when I\u2019m feeling down or unmotivated. 5. Spring Day This song makes me really emotional, but I still love it. It is originally about losing a loved one and the song depicts that feeling very well in my opinion. I also interpret this song in a different way though and I really admire that about this song. You can apply it do different situations. The music video for this song is so pretty and I love when the boys perform this song live. These were just a few of my favorite BTS songs and I might add more later Anyways, bye <333 ",

Blood sweat and tears- the song which Introduced me to kpop. I fell in love with jimins falsetto. And the visuals and aesthetics of the music video were on a completely different level.Boy with luv- I loved that they embraced their femininity and elegance in this song. The pink outfits along with the pastel themes and their hair colours melted my heart.Save me - this was the perfect mashup of pop and melancholy for me.Not today- the beat and background music, especially that one repeating tune gave off a bollywoody feeling and thus I kept on listening to it more and more. The best chore ever I feel.Dope- I'm not a fan of rap( don't kill me)but this songs rap somehow made me want to listen to it over and over again. Oh and jin as doctor and jungkook as a police officer, dancing and thrusting like that gave me the feels.Idol- I loved jimins moves with the traditional handfan, and the choreo in the chorus was amazing. This was a really unique and catchy song for obvious reasons.Fire- what can I say the song was lit and it burnt my heart.Spring day- I can't get over its melody and the message.DNA- taehyungs visual and the choreo in the end were amazing. I loved the bridge very much.Boy in love: the music video did not age well with me, especially the scenes with the girl (cultural differences) but boy did the song pack a punch. And the ad libs and post chorus stuck in my mind.I hope this helps. Again these are my personal preferences and I hope I don't offend anybody. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly for me, I listen to Magic Shop to make me feel better. Whenever I\u2019m feeling down or just not having a good day or moment, I turn on Magic Shop. I turn it up until I can\u2019t hear anything. The lyrics are so touching. You were the one that made your way to meI do believe your galaxyI want to listen to your melodyYour stars in the Milky WayDon\u2019t forget that I found you anywaysAt the end of my despairYou\u2019re the last reasonFor me who was standing at the edge of the cliffLive This song is basically about how ARMY helped BTS through all of their hardships and helped them become the successful and wonderful people they are today. The song is a way for ARMY\u2019s to feel comforted and reassured. When we are in look of help or someone to be there, we can open a door in our heart, and BTS will be there in the Magic Shop. Here are some more of my favorite lyrics. Let's make a door. It's in your heart Open the door and this place will await Magic Shop While drinking a glass of hot teaAnd looking up at the Milky WayYou\u2019ll be alright, oh, this here is the Magic Shop I feel like it\u2019s not true that I wanted to be the bestI wanted to become your comfort and move your heartI want to take away your sadness, and pain Other songs I love to listen to when I\u2019m a bit down is 2! 3! (Still Wishing For Better Days) and Whalien 52. 2! 3! is about erasing all of the bad memories you\u2019ve had in the past, and take Bangtan\u2019s hand and smile and laugh. It is also another comforting song in which ARMY\u2019s can be able to feel relief after hearing it. It's okay, now when I say \"one two three\", forget it all. Erase those sad memories, let's take each other's hands and laugh. Even so, there will be good days ahead. If you believe my heart, one, two, three. For believing in the me who is like this, for dealing with these tears and wounds. So thanks. for becoming my light, for becoming the flower of our most beautiful moments. The song in its entirety is special to me and holds a lot of meaning to me. Whalien 52 is about the 52 Hertz whale. The whale has been known as the \u2018Loneliest Whale\u2019. The whale calls at a rather higher pitch than regular whales (52 HZ), calling at 10\u201339 HZ. Although you may be calling, whether it\u2019s trying to stand up for yourself, you may not be heard. But continue to keep trying. BTS conveys that you will be heard if you just continue trying, even if you\u2019re ignored or shrugged off. In the middle of the vast oceanOne whale speaks softly and lonelilyThe fact that no matter how much they shout, it won\u2019t reach Edit: I also wanted to include 21st Century Girl and Butterfly. 21st Century Girl is about women empowerment and Butterfly is about a great love. Many will interpret these songs in a different way. ",

            "answer_text": "LOL trust me love, I can never pick one even if my life depended on it - I love all their songs equally. However, if I had to tell you about my BTS music tastes, I would say I am more of a big fan of BTS\u2019s lyrics and how deep they can be. Furthermore, I am also more attracted to songs with deeper meaning and lyrics rather than stuff just like DNA or their more \u201cpop\u201d songs. You\u2019ll notice that a good portion of these songs have been rapped / produced by Namjoon and Yoongi, especially the latter for his deep and heartbreaking lyrics, whom has continued to inspire me daily. If I narrowed it down to one single playlist (in no particular order): \u2022The Last - Agust D \u2022First Love - Suga \u2022Truth Untold - BTS \u2022All Cyphers + Mic Drop (I like to refer to this as one series of songs) \u2022I Love You - Jin \u2022Tomorrow - BTS \u2022Run - BTS \u20222!3! - BTS \u2022Intro: Never Mind - BTS \u2022Epilogue: Young Forever - BTS \u2022So Far Away - Agust D \u2022Awake - Jin \u2022Reflection - RM \u2022Spring Day - BTS \u2022Outro: Tear - BTS \u2022Magic Shop - BTS \u2022Airplane Pt. 2 - BTS \u2022Anpanman - BTS \u2022Arirang - BTS cover \u2022Someone Like You - V cover \u2022Hug Me - V x JHope cover \u2022 4 o\u2019 Clock - V x RM cover \u2022Agust D - Agust D \u2022Born Singer - BTS \u2022Life - RM \u2022God Rap - RM \u2022Joke - RM \u2022Even If I Die, It\u2019s You - Hwarang OST - V x Jin \u2022Fake Love - BTS As of right now, if you asked me to pick 3 songs to forever listen on repeat, they would be: \u2022The Last - Agust D \u2022Truth Untold - BTS \u2022Spring Day - BTS Hope it will help! If you should be a new MILITARY, I very suggest you pay attention to these tracks, which over in addition need similar buzz as Fake prefer. We remain securely by the fact that Spring Day along with the HYYH age deserve equivalent hype as our queen LY: Tear. Pleased listening!

            "answer_text": "Gah, what an awful question! Ha! NOTE: I love pretty much every song BTS shares with us and think that my \u201cfavourites\u201d are determined by my mood. But, below, I have given my top three because Samita is a cruel, cruel person and requested an answer and I shall oblige. 3. Magic Shop.  When I became an ARMY, I went through all of their music - I have RM\u2019s, Suga\u2019s and J-hope\u2019s mixtapes, have listened to all of their cover songs, found \u201chidden\u201d tunes like Sea and have been truly astounded by the range of styles BTS can present musically\u2026but then I found Magic Shop. The melody is beautiful and every member does an amazing job - both live and in the album release - and the song just resonated with me. I could be cooking dinner and ta-da! There I am, singing Magic Shop for no other reason than it came to my head. To be corny, there is something magical about this song that just demands people love it - and, if you don\u2019t\u2026well, it\u2019s your loss! 2. Mikrokosmos.  This song has so many plays on my iTunes and I can sing it word for word\u2026badly, but I can, even if my Korean pronunciation is awful. Before knowing the lyrics, because I like to just enjoy music before reading about it, Mikrokosmos just made me feel happy and hopeful. It felt like everything was good and I think it was an ingenious idea to make this their concluding song during concerts, because people would leave BTS\u2019 venue feeling like everything would be fine even if something (like the concert) had ended. It feels like it is filled with love and I was so pleased that it was also their concluding song during BTS Class of 2020 performance. 1. Crystal Snow.  I\u2019m not sure I can explain the feelings I get from this song. Crystal Snow, after Moon, has the most plays on my iTunes and I can listen to it no matter my mood - happy, angry, upset, chill, bored: just put on Crystal Snow and everything seems right with the world. The whole piece, vocals and rap, is just so touching and I will love this song forever - my only peeve with this song is that there isn\u2019t an MV to watch, which I\u2019m convinced would be beautiful. None of my top three have MVs, I\u2019ve just realised. That\u2019s not on, BigHit! However, my most played and repeated song on my iTunes is\u2026 0. Moon.  Jin, in my opinion, you\u2019re welcome to disagree, is the Ballad King - Awake, Epiphany and his beautiful covers like Autumn Outside the Post Office prove that the beauty of his face is mirrored in his voice. But, then we throw in Moon - it\u2019s pop, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s heartwarming and dedicated to ARMYs, further proving just how wonderful Jin\u2019s musical range has become. We all know Jin wasn\u2019t trained as a singer until he joined BigHit and, while I\u2019ve yet to hear a song where Jin sounded \u201cbad\u201d in their debut days, Jin\u2019s voice has certainly gotten more powerful and more stable in the last few years which shows his determination to succeed as a vocalist. I love it, and its singer of course. P.S - Go check out JK proving how much he loves it too on YouTube - it\u2019s so cute!  I could quite literally change this order (with the exception of Moon and Crystal Snow) to include songs like Your Eyes Tell, Spinebreaker, Friends, Euphoria, Cyphers, Epiphany, Spring Day, Sea, Converse High\u2026I\u2019ll stop or I\u2019m just going to list every song in BTS\u2019 catalogue, because they are all amazing. Thank you for the request. TTFN! ",

Secondly, the beat is really nice and I like the different emotions I can feel while watching the MV over 100 timesDdaeng - Okay, this isn\u2019t made by all of bangtan but this is made by a part of bangtan. Ddaeng, first and foremost is a diss track and I am aware of that. This shows off each individual rappers beautiful and mesmerizing voice (especially namjoon\u2019s) but it also disses their haters and this is my everyday bop, you would know its me from afar if i would be screaming \u2018ILPAM ILSAM SAMPAL DDAENG\u201d (but not literally sjsj)Epiphany - As a Jin biased person, this song hit me like a train going full speed. I was in school as I watched this and I was crying during break period, and the whole day I was streaming ang listening to it play over and over again.Butterfly - Okay not to exaggerate but this was the song that made me cry for the first time just listening to it, and of course magic shop made me cry. This song was emotionally wrecking and the vocals to the rap was amazing, so was the lyrics",

            "answer_text": "My favourite songs with all of the group in it is Fake Love, Dionysus, and Crystal snow. Why? Fake love is just because I like the song lol and same goes for Dionysus. The lyrics itself does not really apply to me but they are probably one of my favourite songs. I love the beat, singing, and everything. For crystal snow is for how beautiful it is, its sung so beautifully and it always leaves me smiling every time I hear it. Also, a lot of it has to do with Jin\u2019s high note. Let's be honest, he OWNS that song hands down. My favourite songs as a solo is awake and epiphany. Jins songs has always been the ones that make me either tear up or full up cry when I hear them, and that's a lot because I practically listen to them everyday and still get the same reaction. Okay, lets be honest my bias is Jin. But his music is what made me bias him. Awake always leaves me crying because that's how JIN feels. He expresses his pain in that song and it always makes me emotional listening to it. For epiphany, this song also hits me hard. It expresses self love and I'm so insecure but when I listen to that song I just learn to\u2026love myself? I don't know how to explain it, but \u201cIm the one I should love in this world\u201d is so true and basically what I quote to myself everyday. Epiphany is a wonderful song. Even though I love those songs, nothing can ever come past \u201cSo far away\u201d Which is my favorite song out of bts. This song manages to be more than lyrics, capturing my feelings and making it into a song. It explains me so well and basically how I feel empty and doesn't have a dream. And although Jungkook\u2019s and Jin\u2019s voice in that song is FANTASTIC Suga\u2019s lyrics hit hard and different. I never knew there was a song to explain how I am feeling. So yeah, so far away is my favorite. ",

Any new ARMY out there need to go back and listen to BTS\u2019s older songs- these were the DAYS. Baepsae- Another one of BTS\u2019s lesser-known songs. This is a fan-made M/V. No More Dream- Their debut song, yes. This forever remains iconic. Blood Sweat and Tears- You DO NOT get more iconic than BST. This was the boys\u2019 ERA. As any ARMY what BTS\u2019s most iconic era is, they\u2019ll tell you BST. Dimple/Illegal- This is a newer song from the LYS era, but I also feel like not as many people know about it. For a speech I had to give in class, I wrote my entire introduction about this song so\u2026yeah. Pied Piper- This song is PACKED with meaning and honestly, you can feel the emotion that went into this song. A personal letter to ARMY from the Bangtan boys- how much better does it get? They\u2019re calling us out but hey, still an amazing song. Seesaw- Suga KILLED it with this song. I can\u2019t even begin to explain why I love it so much. Just listen and you\u2019ll know what I mean. Go Go- The Halloween dance practice video that was dropped for this song is honestly a huge reason why I like it so much haha but its also just really good. AIRPLANE Pt. 2- Ooohhhh what a BANGER! Latin vibes in a K-pop song sung by the seven most beautiful boys ever? YES PLEASE. DDAENG- Just listen to it. Another fanmade M/V. Jungshook yet? Love you, ARMY <3 ",

(Because I love the solos so much that my entire top 10 list might be filled with it if I allowed myself xD) but anyways, top 10. :/ that\u2019s hard but I\u2019ll try xD this isn\u2019t in any particular order btw Spring Day\u2014this song has so much meaning to it,it was dedicated to the Sewol Ferry incident. And it is also one of my favorite songs because it is about missing someone who you can\u2019t reach at the moment\u2026about a far-away friendship\u2026and the lyrics and MV are just so beautiful.Outro : Tear\u2014DONT FREAK ON ME SURE I SAID NO SOLOS UP THERE BUT THIS INCLUDES THREE PEEPS FROM BTS SO I COUNT IT! Well maybe I\u2019m making excuses BUT I CANT LEAVE OUT SUCH A GREAT SONG LIKE THIS THE LYRICS ARE EVERYTHING AND VOCAL SUGA AND LIKE JHOPES VERSE GOES BOOM BOOM BOOM aIYaYyyHhHhHhHhHhAnswer : Love Myself\u2014NAH YOU BETTER NOT BE THINKING OF JUSTIN BIEBER YALL THIS IS A SONG ABOUT LOVE WHICH FOR ONCE DOESN'T INCLUDE ANOTHER PERSON! you\u2019ve shown me I have reasons I should love myself~~~those lyrics mean so much. These are what legends look like. This song is so motivational and I love listening to it because IT\u2019S SO BEAUTIFUL GO LOVE YOURSELVES YOU MISERABLE PEOPLE I LOVE YOU TOO21st century girl\u2014absolutely awesome and is a bop till the end of time. When I heard the title of this song i was thinking, \u201cis this expensive girl pt 2 sound with the entire group\u2026?\u201d But I listened to it and watched the lyric video and thought how good other people must feel about themselves. I myself like BTS\u2019s motivational songs and their songs to haters and songs about life more than their flirty/acting like that high schooler, but 21st century girl is different. You should go listen to it. I felt kinda bad for the fanboys cryin in the comment section xDBest of me\u2014absolutely gorgeous. And suga sang. HE SANG. RAP LINE HAS UNDERRATED VOCALS YALL. But then again taehyung has underrated rapping xD but best of me, even if you COULD interpret it as a love song, it has many different meanings. What hit me hard while watching the lyric video was the lyric \u201cplease don\u2019t leave me\u201d. It had so much meaning, it was BEGGING. I remember a point of my life where I was like that\u2026this song is an absolute jam. I love it.dionysus\u2014I LOVE HEAD BOBBING TO THIS SONG ON HEADPHONES FULL VOLUME IF I GO DEAF ON THIS SONG I WOULD STILL LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE IT\u2019S THAT GOOD. What\u2019s funny is that jhope had wrote this song and he\u2019s the most weak to alcohol\u2026that guy has no tolerance level xD he apparently lost his soul in bon voyage for a few hours\u2026but anyways, JIN JIN JIN GO JIN HIGH JIN LOW JIN VOCAL JIN IM TAKING ANY JIN BECAUSE JIN and the rest absolutely killed this song. RM especially, i loved his parts! Thanos would be shook.Pied Piper\u2014all I have to simply say is \u201cJungkook, that\u2019s illegal.\u201dMic Drop\u2014not just because of the MIC MIC BUNGEE part. Mic drop BAM! This shows bangtans true tolerance to haters and it\u2019s also awesome to listen to. The problem is I listen to it way too much before sleeping but I get hyped up afterwards so I can\u2019t sleep lol. But still, DIDJA SEE MY BAG!? this song is just really hands down savage. The mv has more explosions than I can count.Cypher pt 4\u2014basically what I said above copied into here. Especially since the rap line did it, the lyrics blew me away. I mean like sorry man but rap line really killed it. (Killer\u2026lol.) they literally just spat fire onto all haters and pitied them\u2026this is why the BTS rap line is the best\u2026at least, for me. Cypher pt 4 is awesome.Spine Breaker\u2014OH YES I DID PULL A WILD CARD ON YOU DID YOU EXPECT BOY WITH LUV NAHHHHHHH BRO THIS SONG IS TOO GOOD >:DDD but anyways, the pure meaning of this song is really awesome, not just a love song or how hard your work is. It\u2019s about complaining for things that make you seem cool. So this song is basically telling you get some sensibility. \u201cRockin, Rollins, swagger, swaggin, wROnG.\u201dand thats at my top 10. If you have different opinions on your favorite songs, don\u2019t trash me in the comments! Write an answer! Well, thanks for reading. Have an amaJIN day! ",

Yes Ik stay gold is a sad song as It was technically supposed to be their last song on their contract. But as I can speak Japanese and can read it, I take this song to another meeting and it just holds a special place in my heart the BTS did that. 2.Coffee Yes Ik this is a very old song but I am a army from 2014 and I still go back and listen to the old songs and try to find the good bops that are still out there. I also just think it\u2019s a very sweet song. 3.Shadow yes I know this is just A technically solo song in the album but I take Shadow and I have it in my other light in my in my mind. I think Shadow is like a change because Suga says in the song he builds himself back up just so he knows what to change even tho he thinks at the time he can\u2019t ever get rid of his \u2018Shadow\u2019 ",

I over the Mv and the vibe that they we going with. I know some people might say it might be a little western but the thing is they are exploring and trying new things, trying to find out what suits them best. \u25aa Young forever: This song is so meaningful. I really enjoy listening to it and I was so happy when the army's surprised bts at Wembley with this. Thank you Armys. \u25aa Save me: This song actually got me to like them. I had heard other songs of them before but this just made me love them even more. The melody, the lyrics, the tune everything about it is just great. \u25aa 2!3!: I listen to this song whenever I'm stressed put or having a really hard time and believe me it helps so much. Even though I don't know Korean but I'm learning it and I really enjoy this song. \u25aa The truth untold: The lyrics to this song are so meaningful. The first time I heard it I cried because of how beautiful and lovely I found this song. The story behind is what makes it even more sad. This is defiantly one of my number one bts songs. \u25aa Promise (Jimin): I know there are many other songs that I could've chosen but I chose this because of a specific reason. My best friend got posted somewhere else and I had such a bond with her that I can't explain. She basically helped me be myself and made the real me come out. But then she left but we used to sing this song together and we promised each other that we would stay by each other's side. \u25aa Euphoria (Jungkook): I love this song just because I love this song\u2026yeah lol I'm weird I know. \u25aa Cypher pt.4: Boiiiiii.. I don't even need to explain why I love this song. The rap line is killing it. Namjoon\u2019s verse, J-hope\u2019s flow, Suga\u2019s savageness. The beat and the song overall is just such a bop. It's hands down find it the best cypher ever! \u25aa Blood, sweat and tears: This is one of the most aesthetic and iconic songs in my opinion. It's actually the song that got them even more popular than they already were. I really love listening to this song. \u25aa Mikrokosmos: The way the Armys sing it with Bts in concerts is just so amazing. It's a really good song. Armys literally look like stars in the night with those army Bombs. It's beautiful. That's about it. I have many more songs and the list could go on and on but since it's 10 I'll write 10. Thank you so much for requesting though. ",

            "answer_text": "Since 2013, the group has released more than 20 singles and has multiple chart-topping albums. While their discography could be daunting, if you want to enlist in their fan ARMY, there are a few BTS songs that you definitely need to take a listen to: 1. BTS - \u201cBlood Sweat & Tears\u201d (Wings, 2016) The newest single from BTS is innovative and the culmination of the group\u2019s career so far. After preceding singles began the transition away from old-school hip-hop sounds, \u201cBlood Sweat & Tears\u201d completed the shift with one of the group\u2019s most symphonic singles to date. It\u2019s also one of BTS\u2019 best-selling songs ever, and the lead single from the highest-charting K-pop album ever on the Billboard 200. That\u2019s some serious street cred right there for a song that came out less than 10 days ago. 2. BTS - \u201cNo More Dreams\u201d (2 Cool 4 Skool, 2013) They may have eschewed their athletic wear and heavy hip-hop sound in recent days, but \u201cNo More Dream\u201d is still one of the most iconic BTS songs. The group\u2019s debut song paved the way for the rest of BTS\u2019 career with its energy and inspirational message. While the septet may have outgrown their original sound, it\u2019s still a fan favorite that any BTS fan must know. 3. BTS - \u201cCypher Pt. 3: Killer\u201d (Dark & Wild,2014) BTS has been able to set themselves apart from other K-pop acts by not simply incorporating short raps into their songs but instead seriously incorporating hip-hop into their overarching sound. There\u2019s no better exhibit of the septet's dedication to hip-hop than the cypher tracks on several of their albums. The most popular is 2014\u2019s \u201cCypher Pt. 3: Killer,\u201d which was written by members Rap Monster, Suga and J-hope in collaboration with featured rapper and producer Supreme Boi. (Also check out \u201cCypher 4\u201d on Wings.) The song\u2019s disjointed rhythm and beats paired with the forceful lyrics and venomous raps is extraordinarily different from BTS\u2019 most popular singles, but it\u2019s where the depth of BTS is found.

I don\u2019t know if I can pick an all time favorite, but I do have a top three I\u2019ve picked out of ALL of their songs Blood Sweat and Tears. This was one of the first music videos I watched and I loved it. The song is just so amazing. The music video is a work of art. It\u2019s sexy. It\u2019s a visual wonderland. I just love this song.DNA. This is the first song I\u2019d ever heard from BTS. This song made me an ARMY. It was the first video by them I\u2019d ever watched. I love the beat and the whistling in the song and the music video is so beautiful. I love this and it might be my all time favorite.Not Today. This was another one of the first songs and videos I\u2019d ever heard by them. I love the video so much and when the beat drops like I can\u2019t even.All theses songs mean a lot to me and that\u2019s probably why I love them so much, along with how great the music is. I\u2019m not sure if you were asking what my favorite song out of Love Yourself: Tear is, but, my favorites out of that is Fake Love and Singularity. My favorite album is probably Love Yourself: Her. I also love Wings so much and Tear is amazing. ",

It\u2019s super listenable and it just feels rlly nostalgic to me. It reminds me of my favorite bangtan eras and everything, from the music video to the actual song to the lyrics, just feels so perfect. 2.) Intro: Serendipity  It\u2019s hard to describe this song so simply but to me it just feels like a rlly warm hug??? Idk but it just feels so comforting whenever I hear this song. It also suits Jimin\u2019s voice rlly well and the tone compliments his vocal color perfectly. It was made just for him to sing seriously. I just love this song\ud83e\udd70 3.) HOME  I feel like for this song I like it more for its vibe in itself rather than the lyrics. It\u2019s just so catchy and it\u2019s fun to dance to. It\u2019s the first song I rlly fell in love w when I listened to MOTSP. Idk this song just sounds super retro and vibey it\u2019s so good. ~ these r the rest of my favorites. again it\u2019s so hard to rank these\ud83d\ude1e. Honestly speaking every song in this list is first I literally love all of these equally \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 Outro: Her  Amazingggggg song by my favorite rap line. I feel like this song was just so chill yet super heartfelt at the same time. I love it sm it showcased all the most amazing parts of their rap abilities. It also felt so equally distributed when listening to it; all of their voices shined equally. Trivia Love  ive loved this song since first listen and seriously if you haven\u2019t listen to it, plzzzz do. Namjoon is seriously so amazing in the song I can\u2019t explain it. The lyrics, the meaning, the beat is all so perfect for his voice. Lol honestly I can\u2019t wait till he gets married\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05. This man deserves the world! Like  This song is perfectly romantic and flirty and showcases their vocals rlly well. Also the backing vocals are amazing plz listen to them. This song was one of my first favorite songs by BTS so it also feels super nostalgic. Just one day  Another super flirty song lmao. Honestly my favorite part is how Yoongi starts the song. It\u2019s just perfect in every wayy\ud83e\udd7a. It feels again rlly romantic and to explain it honestly it just feels like a confession from a crush. Such a cute song i love it. You Never Walk Alone  Such an iconic picture lol. I love this song sm. It\u2019s a rly song to me because it just feels so warm and comforting.

            "answer_text": "Favourite top 5 songs: (1) Just one day  Why? to be honest, this song has such a special place in my heart. The lyrics, mv and just the music and them itself is absolutely beautiful enough to call it my top favourite song! This was truly one of my favourite era of bts even though they were just starting out. Every time I listen to it I end up mostly crying and getting really into the song because they all just look so adorable and the beat really just makes me groove. I also love the romance songs hehe. \u2022 (2) Tomorrow  why? Well have you seen the lyrics? It\u2019s honestly so deep and mentions their dreams throughout and that they feel hopeless, yet they\u2019re still moving forward with life. This speaks out to me a lot as someone who is quite young and has a lot of hopeless dreams. \u2022 (3) Louder than bombs  Why? omg literally mots: 7 was just it. Like honestly it probably is just as good as wings and wings is like legendary in bts history. This song was absolutely amazing and also namjoon cried while writing the lyrics like..sAme. While listening so many tears I shed bruh. And Jin got so much more lines I was so happy. Is this fine to call number 3 or is it 1? Lmao even idk. \u2022 (4) dead leaves  Why? For reeeallll this song lives in my heart forever. It\u2019s just amazing and there\u2019s no words to describe it in all honesty. P.s all songs produced by yoongi just get to me like\u2014. Please listen to this song. \u2022 (5) Run  Why? To be honest, does this even need an explanation? I was so stuck between I need u and run but like brO\u2014. I\u2019m a sucker for Hyyh, wings and skool luv affair. I really miss this kind of genre/concept for the music videos. Never not is this song not stuck in my mind like it\u2019s always there haha. thank you, bye. It was so hard to rank these like all of these are just at one\u2014 ",

One of the most popular theories is that the video is dedicated to the victims of the Sewol-Ho tragedy. BTS never confirmed this since they wanted to leave the video open for interpretation. Therefore, everyone who sees the video would interpret it from their own understanding and they would relate to it in different ways. Another reason why I love this song is that it is truly comforting every time I hear it. I can go back to it at whatever mood I am, and I am guaranteed to feel a little warmer inside, like a warm breeze in a cold winter. ",

Boy With Luv Forget what I've mentioned before. I like not only this song, but also the MV. It goes for a cute concept which can attract more new ARMYs. Besides, the melody sounds cheerful yet their handsome smiley faces makes it perfect. I like how Jimin and Halsey sing the \u201cOh My My My\u201d part. They sound so good together 3. Fire I became an ARMY since this era. With the energetic moves and powerful music, it makes me go psycho and become an ARMY just like that. The rap parts and vocal parts are balanced, the raps make the song amazing, the vocal parts make the song perfect! 4. Idol This song is another powerful melody song. It brings out positive information, encouraging people to face the challenges bravely and appreciate themselves. The MV is super colourful, and I kinda like that. 5. Save Me & I'm Fine These two songs are actually related. If you turn the Save Me amphigram (not sure of the spelling) upside-down, you will see I'm Fine. Both of them sound amazing. I've only seen the Save Me MV, and I would like to say I love it. But of course, these two songs sound equally amazing so I can't decide. To admit, I can write more, but I don't want to make this too long. Sorry for any grammar mistakes and fangirling. This is just my opinion. ",

My sister on the other hand is a fan of BTS and i hear her play BTS songs everytime. Their songs are good and very catchy just like other kpop songs but rn i listen to some of their songs which is like a single songs. I really liked Singularity because its very calming even tho when i found out the meaning of the song it doesnt really match the tone if you were to sing it in english. I also like Serendipity its just a good ass song i like it alot. I also like Euphoria and Epiphany is just BEAUTIFUL like his high notes sounds rlly good i actually tease my sister and tell her Seokjin\u2019s voice sounds like he could be a singer on a intros of Anime shows lol idk but his voice in Epiphany is just beautiful. If i were to choose out of 4\u2026 idk they\u2019re all really good like i cant choose because if i choose singularity i liked epiphany as much as it and i also like serendipity as much as epiphany but i also liked euphoria as much as epiphany so i cant really choose so i can say those are the 4 songs that i liked. Oh and also in Mic Drop i rlly loved the entrance of the rap thats my fave part ",

Truth Untold - The lyrics and vocals, the emotions in their voices make me want to ball my eyes out.  Lost Stars (Jungkook) - Now I know that this is a cover of a song, but Jungkook\u2019s voice sounds heavenly and I\u2019m in love. Please listen to it if you haven\u2019t already.  Fake Love (Rocking Vibe Mix) - I really love this remix, especially the addition of the guitar.  I Need U - This whole era was my favourite, and so is this song.  Pied Piper - This song makes me want to dance. I love it.  Crystal Snow - I love Japanese songs in general, and this one is no exception.  Outro Wings - This one is so underrated, but it\u2019s amazing.

It\u2019s weird, but I like it.Awake. It\u2019s a sad song, but I like it a lot. And plus, Jin is singing and ARMY knows we don\u2019t get to hear enough of him *sniff* *sniff*Cypher pt 4. This song right here is just.. too good. And don\u2019t get me wrong, RM and J-Hope have some really dope parts, but when Suga starts rapping, oh boy. Suga\u2019s voice in Cypher pt 4 is just really addicting. It\u2019s just the way he sounds.I just listened to Heartbeat a few minutes ago and I\u2019M NOT CRYING I SWEAR MY EYES ARE JUST SWEATING. No, all jokes aside, this song is very different, but so amazing and I love it.The Truth Untold. It\u2019s another sad song, but it\u2019s beautiful. Also i\u2019m just a sucker for sad songs.",

Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight\u2019 with just two simple lines of verse, sums up most relationship quarrels. Like I said, esoteric. One persons awe! Is another ones egads!

But Jungkook's voice in this song is like literally angelic!! Truth to be told i don't have words to describe how heavenly the song is. His voice so perfect,so smooth,it blends effortlessly with the music. Literally i become euphoric listening to it. As an international army,i can't understand korean language. But i had fallen in love with the song even before i checked the lyrics. And the mv too,what do i say?? It makes me happy and sad the same time,the bond,the friendship. They are not faking it for the camera,all the armies would agree with me. The video is so simple,but it's filled with love and passion,beautiful relationships portrayed in such a warm way. Beautiful visuals of the boys,along with JK's heavenly voice-a priceless combo. The song was released without any prior notification,but it was such a pleasant surprise.  Other honorable mentions would be butterfly,blood sweat and tears,spring day,DNA,boy with luv.home,mikrokosmos etc. If you haven't listened to any of these yet,please go amd listen.

Home this is song is amazing. jimin\u2019s vocals are out of this world, and the rapline slayed. the only thing i wish they\u2019d change is taehyung getting more lines. his voice really suited the song imo 4. Dream Glow this song is very special to me, why? because i had it on repeat when traveling, and it reminds me of it. i also love jungkook\u2019s and charli\u2019s vocals. also, jin\u2019s high not slapped. 3. Mikrokosmos this song, along with Home, is my favorite out of the MOTS album. the lyrics is so meaningful, and it always makes me tear up. i have a thing for Bts\u2019 emotional songs, if you couldn\u2019t tell lmao. 2. Don\u2019t Leave Me this is my all time favorite song of the Japanese albums. i love the vocalists in this specific song, and yoongi\u2019s rap was amazing. usually, i don\u2019t like the Japanese songs, because i\u2019ve gotten used to how Korean songs sound, but this one for some reason didn\u2019t sound like the others. Pied Piperjungkook singing this at 5th Muster is one of the most beautiful things i\u2019ve ever seen. the lyrics also motivates me to work hard in school (wow that sounded clich\u00e9). the chorus always gets me up dancing and i just love it with all my heart. honorable mentions: Heartbeat Not Today Epiphany Euphoria Dionysus Make it Right Run 21st century Girls ~aria louise ",

            "answer_text": "If it's a BTS song, then it would probably be Blood, Sweat and Tears. I also think that it was BTS' best era because the song, choreography and music video was just too good to be true, it's an art tbh. But if you ask me what's my favourite song from other artists then : Bad Boy by Red Velvet- I have never listened to a song like that ever and I couldn't stop listening to it. The song deserve Song of the Year more than Love Scenario and Shine. Plus, I'm still listening to this song ever since it came out in January last year. EPIC!!!Tempo by EXO- Literally outsold every song of their own. Their vocals are on point as always, their dance and the music video was absolutely perfect!Simon Says by NCT 127- This song is one of a kind. I never expected something like this before. I feel like every time I listen to this song, I would feel superior to anyone else because I just feel as if I'm in another world, another century, I feel like this music defines the future.Solo by Jennie- I was quite disappointed at first when it came out because I thought that the chorus would have been very upbeat like I was expecting that the beat would drop but thst didn't happen. However after a few listen I think that the song was quite good and it got stuck on my head so\u2026",

I loved the choreography. I think it was cool that they tried more of a contemporary dance. I think the auto tune was a good fit for this song. I know a lot of people hate severe auto tune but on some songs I think it can make the song better. This was an example. I also loved the message behind it. The quote \u201cA dancer dies twice, once when they stop dancing and the first is the more painful\u201d. I thought it was cool how they related that quote to their passion for music. I liked that the message was a bit different from what they normally do. Overall, Black Swan is just amazing. My next favorite song is definitely either Tear or Tomorrow. Highly recommend them!

I guess Dream Glow for me is more enjoyable as it\u2019s something I can actually jam out to, and dance to, to get me in a good mood. A Brand New Day is a chill song for me, something I\u2019d put on if I wasn\u2019t having a drink and sitting doing nothing, whereas All Night is, I guess something I\u2019d put on occasionally for either chilling or dancing to. I don\u2019t know, I have weird reasoning but those are my reasons. I can\u2019t wait for the next song that they\u2019ve done altogether as well! Generally I\u2019m proud of all the songs and the collaborations as well that have already been so successful and also shows the talent of all the people involved. ",

            "answer_text": "Lie - JiminThe composition, the power, everything is absolutely perfect and it encompasses everything I\u2019m feeling at each and every moment. 2. Paradise - BTS The production of the song is gorgeous in every single way and it never fails to make me vibe 3. We are Bulletproof: The eternal -RM Find me and ARMY who dislikes this song, I mean it just goes to show how much their truly grateful for this amazing fandom and what sort of idol dedicates an entire song (multiple songs actually) solely to their fans? BTS that\u2019s who. 4. Intro: Person - RM I love rap and the rap line in BTS is amazing, probable one of the best in the industry but this song just encloses the special way in which RM sees the world. A lot of BTS songs have to do with identity and trying to figure out who they are but this and the next song are truly my favourites. 5. Interlude: Shadow - Suga What list would this be if I didn\u2019t add this song. It shows how much Suga has grown, but has so many throwbacks to old lyrics from their very first album and his flow is just indescribable. 6. Outro: Ego - JHope Like I said, I love rap, but Ego is such a happy song and is quite technically difficult for someone who didn\u2019t start off as a rapper. But I mean BTS loves this song as well and it\u2019s not very hard to see. 7. Spine Breaker - BTS Whenever I hear this song I always think of the MV which is absolutely amazing. It just tells you how BTS went from having to record their MV\u2019s all by themselves to having videos costing millions of won. And of course, Jin\u2019s choreography is top-notch. 8. House of cards - Jin, Jungkook, V and Jimin I found it really hard trying to choose between this and Dimple, because the vocal line is just incredible in both. But this performance holds a special place in my heart because it was one of my first BTS lives that I had ever watched, and it was just stunning. 9. Serendipity - V The tonal quality in this song always blows me away. V\u2019s voice is one of the most unique in the industry, and the huskiness in his sound is what makes this song absolutely magical. 10. Boyz with fun - bts This song is honestly such a throwback and it just sounds so fun and lively. I adore the maturity the current BTS brings to the stage these days as well as the beautiful and well thought out lyrics, but sometimes I live for the days they bring back these classics because the pure fun on the stage is just incredible to watch.

            "answer_text": "Not an exaggeration, but BTS\u2019 latest album, Map Of The Soul:7 is a real bop! All the songs are really good. RM also mentioned in his latest livestream on V app that how much effort was put in each and every track. It\u2019s really difficult to choose a favourite track out of these bops. But ON, the title track is so catchy and it literally lifts up your mood within few seconds. \u201cBlack Swan\u201d is so deep and it reflects the innear fear of an artist. Also, Friends (by Jimin and V), and Respect (by Suga and RM) are awesome too. As much as \u201cZero o\u2019 clock\u201d/00:00 is soothing and melancholic, \u201cLouder than Bombs\u201d is that much meaningful. Not to mention, how much emotional and deep \u201cWe Are Bulletproof: The eternal\u201d is! And seriously speaking, all the single tracks are outstanding in their own ways. All of them reflect the members and their thoughts perfectly. So in conclusion, I love all of them. Stan BTS and stream ON and BLACK SWAN. \ud83d\udc9c Also, stay healthy. ",

            "answer_text": "Spring Day will always be my favorite song because it has this emotional connection for many people. It has a message that so many people can agree with and can relate to. The song has always been a song that I feel emotionally attached to from the second I heard it. Most other people will say their favorite song is DNA or Mic Drop or another song like that, but for me it will always be Spring Day since it is something that I listen to when I am feeling a little down. That song helps me get back into a good mood because I feel like it is a song that people think gets them and whatever they are going through. Even the English translation of the lyrics have a feeling that all of them understand what you have and are going through. So that is why Spring Day will always be my favorite BTS song and why I can\u2019t really choose any other song over this one. ",

Personally, I\u2019m more into ballads and songs with emotion than dance and energy, so my personal favourites among their group songs would have to be these (in no particular order): Spring DayJust One DayEpilogue: Young Forever134340ButterflyDionysus (what a surprise, right?)Crystal SnowI Need UPied PiperI Like It pt 2For each of these songs I\u2019ve had a period where I would listen to these songs over and over again (which lasted for about a week approximately), so I have a soft spot for these songs. Of course, every song is great if it is by BTS! I can recite most of their songs by heart and know what they are generally about, but for me, these 10 are my favourite musically. ",

Favourite part is J-hope's rap and chorus part. 5-Spring Day:One of the best songs about missing someone.Only bad part about this song is J-hope is just doing back vocalising so I prefer live versions.

I am addicted to this song. 8-Anpanman:I love this song esspecially live versions. 9-Louder than bombs-Jimin and Jin fits this song perfect.

I\u2019m one of those people who get anxiety when I listen to fast-paced songs (*cough* Dionysus *cough*), so Epiphany has that slow, relaxing feel to it. Epiphany has such a beautiful meaning to it. It\u2019s definitely the song you\u2019d listen to when you\u2019re feeling depressed. I really like the instrument choice. Violins are really special to me, because I find that whichever song I listen to that has violins, it makes me emotional and happy. What does it mean to me? I\u2019ve always felt such a connection to the song. Maybe it\u2019s not as popular, but that just makes me feel like the song is all for me. I tend to get depressed really often nowadays,(2019 hasn\u2019t been really kind to me/my family) so listening to this song makes me feel special. It literally \u2018cures\u2019 my depression. It, like, quenches my thirst for a song that understands me. How often I listen to it. Whenever I can. Happy or sad, the song is always there for me. But especially when I\u2019m depressed. ",

Not only because of that, I felt the song having a funky genre which I like it sounds really fun and a song to dance to. As in Korean songs, I really love RUN! I don\u2019t know why maybe because of their chorus or melody or whatever\u2026 when they sing \u201crun run run\u201d it literally is enough for me, it takes me to heaven and back ^^Anyways, That song really stood out to me. Just saying, I love all of their songs but to mention the above two are my favourites, but along with it are boy with luv, save me, Mic Drop, Fake Love, etc Fake Love is the reason why I started loving their songs, I saw their interviews first then their song for the first time which was Fake Love. I didn\u2019t like Idol much then and can\u2019t say if I do right now maybe because of how it was filmed\u2026 it seemed too much back then cause in American mv I had watched before they don\u2019t include bright yellow pink bgs with animals in the back LOL so the hell was I surprised upon seeing Idol and that's also why I loved Fake Love.. it seemed the background connected with the song even though I didn\u2019t understand Korean. So chances were IDOL\u2019s bg and everything and all was perfect had I watched it with subtitles ^^ but still it doesn\u2019t toll on me much and I was surprised to see it had the most views with 1 B . Anyways ^^ I hope this answer was what you needed to hear. Thanks for reading~ ",

Anyways, I have 3 for totally different reasons and I know you asked for 1, but what can I say, its BTS? I love Spring Day, it just brings back the nostalgia where I thought I was stepping into the fanbase just to bop to one of their songs and thats it. However, that did not happen, I have read, watched and listened to literally everything about them because they are great people and an amazing band. Spring Day's melody and beat right at the start just gets you a little emotional i guess, it was around the time, they were a small company and didn't have much fame going on and now looking back on this piece of music, you realise how far they've reached with records and awards. Also, I love Dionysus because it is such a bop, the rap line just pulled it off and just brought the bar up so high and the vocal line blended their vocals so well with the rapline and like the song was aggressively beautiful, and the performance was just AMAZING and I had to watch it again and again to get all my vitamins and minerals. Lastly, their recent song, \u201cYour eyes Tell\u201d was just so serene and let me just say Jimin and Jungkook killed the high notes putting a prepubescent girl to shame. The lyrics were just beautiful, also knowing the fact our Maknae had wrote and composed the song just felt really fulfilling and a proud moment for him as he did a great job. ",

The choreography fit well, and lots of props to the camera-man for that one shot. Skool Luv Affair is my favorite song from a subunit, which was the entire rap line in this case. I love how we got to hear all three of their rapping styles in clear succession and RM\u2019s (my bias) part in it was an absolute bop. Seesaw by Suga is my favorite solo song from one of the members. There\u2019s something about a member of the rapline singing so beautifully that pulls me in every time. But to be honest, any time Yoongi does anything, I have breath stoles. That\u2019s why he\u2019s my bias wrecker. ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite BTS song would have to be either Young Forever or Save Me. The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Young Forever is my favorite album, and I have always loved Young Forever because the meaning is beautiful. They talk about how no matter what struggles they go through, they will endure it because they want to achieve their dream and stay young forever. Hoseok\u2019s part is my favorite in this song. He explains how selfish it may be to want the audience forever, but he wants it anyway and he will continue to sing for us because he wants to stay young forever. I think this song is absolutely beautiful. Save Me is also right up there with Young Forever because it is probably one of the most romantic songs I\u2019ve ever heard. They found the ones they love, ARMY, and they are so grateful for us. They explain how we\u2019re the source of their happiness when Hoseok says \u201cplease raise your voice so I can smile/laugh again.\u201d How is that not beautiful??!! Everything about this song is beautiful. They are asking us to save them, and then at the end, Namjoon is thanking us for all we\u2019ve done. I love all of the lyrics in this song, but Namjoon\u2019s might have to be my favorite in this song. He thanks us for giving him strength and how we helped him so much he threw away his sadness ending with \u201cthank you, for being \u2018us\u2019.\u201d Plus him harmonizing with Jungkook is so beautiful it needs to happen more often. So yeah these two are my favorites. I don\u2019t know if I can choose between the two because whenever I feel like Save Me might take first place, Young Forever just comes in and reminds me how beautiful it is. Feel free to comment what your favorite song is, I would really like to know because BTS has so many great songs I didn\u2019t think I could ever narrow down the list to these two :) I purple you all <3 Stay safe and healthy!

But if I have to choose, I would like choose each song based on each member since each of them have their own era in some songs so I will list it for you: Seokjin: Epiphany, Awake (such a powerful vocalist and give him more attention people!) Yoongi: Trivia: Seesaw, Boy with Luv (man the moment I heard his voice I was SHOOKETH, it was rap but also sound like he was singing for me!) Hoseok: Airplane, \ud56d\uc0c1 (sorry for give his mixtape here, but he definitely shine in this and I keep playing this on replay!) Namjoon: jokes, do you (I seriously love his rap and honey, he was FIRE in his mixtape. But this mixtape were so underated so I need this mixtape on Spotify right now!) Jimin: Lie, Promise (Our Mochi was so sweet in these songs, and I love the way that he enunciates the words and it gives me chills sometimes!) Taehyung: Stigma, Scenery (I think personally his voice will be fit so good with ballad or sad songs that require emotions, and he needs to keep going with this genre cause honey, I cried the moment I heard these songs!) Jungkook: Euphoria, Make It Right ( I mean we don\u2019t need to say anything about his vocal, right? He sounded like an angel and I think he would be successful if he got a chance to have a solo career!) Hope that can answer your question! ",

In the song lyrics, they tell about how everything will get better, but there will also be some hardships along that way. Let's only walk on flower trails, I can't say that. Let's only see good things, I can't say that either. Saying that there will only be good things from now on. They are telling us to forget about our worries, struggles, and sadness and to count to three(Hana Dul Set !) and be free from it. It so emotional and motivates me when I\u2019m feeling down whenever I listen to this song I realise that I am not alone and everything will be alright soon.

I put my heart in that writing \ud83d\ude02  Crystal Snow.I love the vocals of this song, so beautiful. The rap is also slower and flow calmly and nicely. You should listen to Jin\u2019s high notes in here too! Fun fact, this song is one of BTS\u2019s longest song, for 5 minutes and 21 seconds.  Don\u2019t Leave Me.The beat of this song is catchy and fun. Let Go, Crystal Snow, and Don\u2019t Leave Me comes from their Japanese album \u201cFace Yourself\u201d. It is their third Japanese album and my most favorite Japanese album!  Good Day.This one song comes from their Japanese album \u201cYouth\u201d. One day i watched a clip where Jin sang one line of this song. I fell in love and immediately looked for this song.

            "answer_text": "This is a difficult question to answer! Only 10! I will give myself some parameters to make it easier. No solo songs. I will be basing this mostly on the audio and lyrics, not the visuals/live stages/MVs. At least I will try. There are songs that I love but if I take out of consideration the live stages or MVs I end up putting others ahead. For instance, I love Airplane pt2, however, if I remove the live stages and Japanese MV then I have to give other songs a higher spot. Same with Not Today and Go Go. I want to explain why these are my favorites but please understand I have no musical knowledge beyond just liking what I like. I\u2019m going to sound dumb. It\u2019s a mess. In no particular order: Save Me: That high instrument sound in the beginning then Jimin\u2019s angel voice. The amazing colors/lighting from the MV are in my mind when just listening. The lyrics seem sad but the song has a strange energy I can\u2019t explain. Honestly this is one of their best songs, to me, that perfectly showcases BTS as a whole.Spring Day. Our Queen. Start to finish perfection. I love this song possibly the most but with the MV it\u2019s definitely my favorite. The song is melancholy and yet hopeful. Soft pastel Jimin. The MV makes me sob and miss my mom. The piano at the start. Bogo shipda. RM (or Jhope) singing, transition to rap. Ugh, so good. Jhope with his sub vocals (if that is the proper term), JK harmonizing with RM and Hobi, Tae\u2019s vocals in this song are some of his best, the Suga/Jimin part and then into Suga\u2019s rap. Jin is perfect. The only thing that keeps this song from being absolutely the most perfect creation is Hoseok not having a bigger part. At the same time his part is huge with the sub vocals. I think he makes the song in a way?Just One Day. Exhibit 1: Suga\u2019s whole verse.Exhibit 1a: That part where his voice goes lower. 1b: Yoongi-ah Exhibit 2: J-hope\u2019s verse. I love the entire song but those parts are my favorites. This is one I sing along to. Badly sing along to but that\u2019s okay.Blood Sweat & Tears: I love the energy of this song. Sensual. Our boys are all grown up! I\u2019m not sure what else to say about this masterpiece. Money money money.Intro: Nevermind: Suga, lyrics, music/beat, Suga, lyrics,RM, Suga, Jhope, lyrics, Suga. I can\u2019t even with this song. It gives me feels. Ya\u2019ll Suga is my bias. This song is one of the many reasons. End of story.Dionysus: My young queen. Excuse me Jin and Jhope who gave you the right to be so perfect. I adore how different this song is. I stan BTS for their desire to explore their art.Mic Drop. Jhope, hello. This song is such a jam. Love the energy, the message. Suga. All of them. Probably my most quoted song. \u201cDid you see my bag. Did you see my bag\u201d134340. Pluto. I just call it Pluto, okay. Don\u2019t come at me with numbers even when they have meaning. Well this song blew me away. The lyrics. Why you do this to me? Suga\u2019s rap is top notch. I don\u2019t mean to ignore the other members! Suga Bias.Pied Piper. Those lyrics. The vocals. Let\u2019s stop there.Boy with Luv. Sigh. I love the sound and energy of this song. The lyrics though really get me. Poem for the Small Things. That right there is what makes love so special, right? It\u2019s those little things, how\u2019s your day, teach me about you, mannerisms. I know the song is about more than that and I love it all. Halsey adds and blends in perfectly. And, yes, Suga\u2019s rap, shocking us with the low start!",

I love BTS and most of their songs have a really good meaning and they\u2019re so catchy! I love them all equally, but BS&T has stolen the first spot. Why? It was my first full kpop song that I actually enjoyed, so it holds a special spotI really love catchy music with a detailed MVThose visuals and outfits, vocals and rap, and the acting- Okay, you get itThe song that got me into kpop. This could go along with bullet point 1, but hey, this song is just a bop with a deep meaning.And those are my reasons! ",

Yes. But to BTS? Nope. This song, along with the way it was produced, really brings out the way BTS saw their hardships coming during debut, and overall adjusting to fame. Hoseok even says, \u201cI know I\u2019ll overcome.\u201d This inspires me, knowing that BTS has grown into the group they are today, but it didn\u2019t come easy. They had to pass through those roughs seas and deserts, but sometimes everything is a mirage, and yet they still stay the humble people they are. ",

It also gives me time to just sit there and think about life in general. It taught me to enjoy the little things and don\u2019t take life for granted. The BTS Song that makes me feel the most is Forever Young This song reminds me that we aren\u2019t young forever and we need to enjoy life as much as possible before we get too old. We should just live in the moment instead of worrying about the future and past because time flies. ",

It was a terrible time for me because I was in a place I couldn\u2019t get out of. The song didn\u2019t take me out of that place, but it always comforted me while I cried. There was always nothing on muni mind but how much ignorance hurt to feel like nobody cared about me. So listening and reading the lyrics helped me realize how many other felt that same way. That no matter how much it hurt, others felt that way too; that we\u2019d all get through it even though we were singing different songs that seemingly couldn\u2019t be heard. ",

Plus the acting capacity of the boys in this music video is so powerful (like in I Need U or Run) they make you feel exactly what they want to express, through their expressions, voices and all. Really it never gets old and I hope I will feel the same about it even in ten years. My favorite song with Save me and I Need U. Sorry for the mistakes, english is not my native language. ",

That doesn\u2019t mean I hate it; I like basically all of BTS\u2019 songs, but I just like some more than others. Autumn Leaves, Sea, The Truth Untold, Lost, House of Cards, Rain. These are some of my absolute FAVORITE songs by BTS. They\u2019re just so sensational, and the melody just goes so well with the lyrics. They\u2019re very well produced and the members voices shine very brightly. From their earlier albums, I also liked: Coffee, If I Ruled the World, Converse High, Spine Breaker, Attack on Bangtan, 2nd Grade. These songs are a little more hip-hop ish and more upbeat, and in the right mood, these songs would be my go-to jam. From their more recent albums, I liked: Dimple, Pied Piper, Paradise, Love Maze, Tear, Her, Jaimais Vu. These songs are a mix of chill and love yourself-style. Definitely all bops. I\u2019m not actually one to have a title track as a favorite of an album, but my favorite of all the title tracks would HAVE to go to: Blood, Sweat, and Tears Cuz Jimin needs to calm down. ",

I always listen to these 3 songs everyday and it makes me want to cry everytime. Every BTS' songs have special meaning and place in my heart. Tommorow, 2!3!, Mic Drop, Epiphany, all of them. ",

BTS says don\u2019t neglect what is important in life. I love their new song, Your Eyes Tell, thank you Jungkook for writing it. The melody is so beautiful and emotional. Taehyung is my bias and when he sings his part, I feel it in my heart. I listen to it once every day. ",

Mic drop featuring Steve Aoki(all their collabs with Steve was dope actually)  I really liked Fake love too - although it did have a bit too many love you so mad, love you so bad lines for my liking.  Don't leave me - I just love that part where they sing don't leave me. I used to listen to that part on repeat like crazy when it was released.  DNA - the MV is a bit too colorful but it was still a song with a very different vibe  Pied piper - I can't even explain it, this song just gets to me  This is a fan made mv, but it's pretty great. Honerable mention 1- Blood, Sweat and Tears I personally am not a big fan of this song, but bst is the best BTS MV so far in my opinion. It was a visual treat.  ",

I have the music video version downloaded so I get to listen to the train, waves and the ououoh~ part at the end. It\u2019s a mssmerising song that gives me chills every time I listen to it and it actually makes you feel as if you\u2019re listening to that period of time between winter and spring, if that period were a song. It also holds a personal meaning to me, which makes it the best BTS song in my opinion. My best friend and I live very far away from each other so once we were texting about how much we miss each other and then we both started crying. We then realised we were both listening to Spring Day. When I had family troubles, Spring Day told me \u201cafter winter passes, spring will come/ the morning will come again/ no darkness, no season can last forever\u201d. ",

I tend to lean more towards the elegant, old school, and R&B side of K-Pop which is why these are the best BTS songs in my opinion. 1.) Hold Me Tight  2.) Black Swan  3.) My Time  4.) Paradise  5.) Love Maze  6.) Autumn Leaves  7.) Just One Day  8.) House of Cards  9.) Pied Piper  10.) N.O  11.) Love Is Not Over  12.) Stigma  13.) 2! 3!  14.) Like  These are in no particular order btw. ",

It always manages to calm me down when I'm stressed and I find it more important than my grades but whatever. The lyrics are sweet, Jimin's voice is even sweeter. The music video gives me will to live. 3.Cypher 3: it's one of the only songs that make me get up and fricking dance. It's so savaaggee and some of the lyrics are ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).

In terms of showcasing the vocal ability of the members and for soulful and emotional singing, Spring Day and The Truth Untold are the best in this aspect so they are also among my favourites. Even though it could be better, I have a soft spot for Black Swan. The instrumentals are really quite nice(the fact that there are real instruments in a k-pop song for a change, a reason why I stan IU because she often has different instruments in her songs) and the Music Video is definitely among the best in BTS discography. For Rap songs, Dope has the most driving and exciting beats and well executed raps that climaxes really nicely, so it\u2019s another one of my favourites. Finally, Save Me rounds up my favourite BTS songs. It\u2019s universal message and lyrics really speak to you. ",

I could say I love them with all of my heart (I\u2019m not a Sasaeng) I can narrow it down to my top 3\u20135. The truth untold- I have always loved this song. It\u2019s so touching.Favorite part- You know that I can\u2019tShow you meGive you meI can\u2019t show you a ruined part of myselfOnce again I put a mask on and go to see youBut I still want you But I knowI can't do that foreverI have to hideBecause I'm a monster I am afraidI am shatteredI\u2019m so afraidThat you will leave me again in the endOnce again I put on a mask and go to see you- I love this part because I can relate. I used to love someone that I could never have. He didn\u2019t know I existed. He was always focused on someone or something else. I stood from afar and never got the courage to talk to him. He moved away last year and i still hate myself for not talking to him and letting him get to know me. 2. Spring day- I also really love this song. I also can relate to it so much Favorite parts- Snowflakes fall downAnd get farther away little by littleI miss you (I miss you)I miss you (I miss you)How long do I have to waitAnd how many sleepless nights do I have to spendTo see you (to see you)To meet you (to meet you) Passing by the edge of the cold winterUntil the days of springUntil the days of flower blossomsPlease stay, please stay there a little longer Is it you who changed (Is it you who changed)Or is it me (Or is it me)I hate this moment, this time flowing byWe are changed you knowJust like everyone you know Yes I hate you, you left meBut I never stopped thinking about you, not even a dayHonestly I miss you, but I\u2019ll erase you'Cause it hurts less than to blame you- So my boyfriend dumped about 2 weeks ago. We were together for a little and best friends a year before that. We thought we were in love. But he didn\u2019t feel that way anymore 3. Crystal Snow- I really like this song. It\u2019s really touching and sounds amazing Favorite part- I want to protect you one more time before tears run down your faceBut crystal gets further from reach, the more I wish for itEven after hundred years, I want to live with youCan I be your one?There is no single star in this snowy sky, oh, someday, someday- This is a small part but this also had to do with my ex. When he was sad I wanted to protect him. I didn\u2019t want him to feel alone. But he didn\u2019t care that I wanted him safe. 4. Danger (this is one of there older songs). This talks about how someone is messing with there brains, and the person thinks it\u2019s all a game. Favorite parts- Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?You are in danger nowWhy are you testing me? Why are you testing me?Don\u2019t get me twisted You hurt me so!You hurt me so!You hurt me so!Don\u2019t get me twistedYou are too bad to me!You are too bad to me!You are too bad to me!Don\u2019t get me twisted WhatWhat am I? What am I? What am I to you?I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friendsWant you. Want you. Uh~ I want youYou are trickster. You are a criminal who shook my heart..I had already wasted my heart even before it started to burnMy one-way proposes are waste of timeIf I was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. I\u2019m such a love loser- Ok I know it\u2019s about love but my point is about where they say WhatWhat am I? What am I? What am I to you?I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends. I had toxic friends a little while back. They would spread rumors about me and they didn\u2019t care about me. They would only want to hurt me. But then they would apologize to me. But they thought it was like a game.    ",

The song that I play on my dad days and had a powerful impact into the way I view myself is Answer:Love myself. I know this song is fairly recent but before that it was songs like Save me and I'm fine. But answer : love myself has had the most impact I would say. I have just started feeling better about my self. One of my most recent tweets was me saying \u2018To me I was dead. I was void of any emotions and feelings. BTS have brought me back to life and I couldn't be more grateful. Thank you such for giving me life. I now live my life to do what you have done for others. Giving them hope.\u2019 That song specifically had changed my opinions on life itself. ",
