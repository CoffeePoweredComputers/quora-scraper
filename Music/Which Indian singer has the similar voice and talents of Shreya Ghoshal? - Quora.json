            "answer_text": "See I agree that few singer have a voice similar to Shreya Ghoshal. Many think Anwesha or Palak sound similar to Shreya but factually they only try to copy her. Listen to their interview voice and their singing voices, it's too different. But yes these two have a similar singing voice to Shreya but fall completely flat on the high notes and their voices can be distinguished from Shreya's voice but this factor. Second part of the question: who has talents like her? Amongst the current singer, only Sunidhi Chauhan. If you wanted a dinner who has voice as well as talent like her than there is no one. ",
