            "answer_text": "While I admittedly don't know this for a fact, I strongly suspect the change to the user interface you mentioned can be directly attributed to Apple\u2019s decision to enter into the streaming music business. Thus putting them in direct competition with Pandora. It\u2019s logical to assume Pandora decided to remove the option allowing users to quickly link to iTunes and purchase a song title streaming on Pandora to avoid facilitating further sales for their competition. Granted most users will just pull up iTunes and manually search and purchase the song but you\u2019d probably be surprised at the impact to sales. Maybe not sales in general but from pandora users wanting to purchase a song they're currently streaming. Unfortunately it does impact user experience and specifically convenience. I know I personally am disappointed by and frustrated with the change. In short, Pandora\u2019s brass appears to have calculated the benefit from adversely impacting Apples sales(by making it less convenient for their users to purchase music via iTunes) justified the adverse impact to user experience and ultimately satisfaction. That\u2019s my theory anyways which I\u2019d argue is well reasoned and grounded in logic. ",
