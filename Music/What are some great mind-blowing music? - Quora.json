            "answer_text": "I am a big fan of Morphine. There are all sorts of undertones to their music. There is a brooding sense of melancholy yet Mark Sandman\u2019s distinct vocals and slide bass along with Dana Colley\u2019s double sax lines have a sensuality to them as well. Jerome Deupree also has more space to let his drumming \u201cBreathe\u201d than most others because of the sparse instrumentation. I love the production as well. ",
