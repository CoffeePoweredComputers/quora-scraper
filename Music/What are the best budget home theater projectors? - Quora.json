            "answer_text": "Are you looking for the best home theater projector at an affordable price?. In any case, we have strived to find in this entry devices with a fork of big price and suitable for very different budgets. There are also newcomers to the market, and some more veterans. But they all have something essential in common: their high quality allows them to convince even the most demanding moviegoers. Before we go into matter, a note. Any of these projectors is suitable for watching cinema, television and video games. The most demanding scenario is always the cinema, at least when we feed the projector with the video coming from a Blu-ray Disc film, so if it has a good contrast, detail in dark areas and subjective resolution when we see a movie, games and Tele They will also look great in it (although worse than BD). Yes, to watch TV we will need an external DVB-T tuner (if possible with HDMI output) because most of the projectors lack it. And if yours are the TVs, do not miss our two device selections below 1,000 euros, and for less than 500 euros. Here we go. This Taiwanese company projector is hard to hit. It is very luminous, as it corresponds to a DLP device; It is also compatible with 3d images, has good connectivity and a very attractive design. But what is most interesting to the moviegoers who are looking for a projector with a great quality of image are the two certifications that this W7000 has: the REC. 709, which ensures a reliable reproduction of the color, and the ISFCCC, which guarantees a high-level factory calibration. 1. BenQ W7000 BENQ W7000 FeaturesFull HD Resolution (1,920 x 1,080 dots)DLP Technology50,000 dynamic Contrast: 1Brightness 2,000 lumensThe best good brightness ANSI and ISFCCC and REC certifications. 709The worst their contrast is lower than that of some of their rivals2. Epson EH-TW9200 This Epson proposal is, without a doubt, one of the most advanced LCD-technology projectors that we can find in the market today. Its features are outstanding, in fact, both its contrast and its ANSI luminosity rival those of the best. In addition, it has ISF certification and incorporates two 3d glasses. The white color version includes a wireless HDMI video receiver, but, yes, its price goes up to 2,999 euros. EPSON EH-TW9200 FeaturesFull HD Resolution (1,920 x 1,080 dots)3LCD TechnologyDynamic Contrast 600,000:1Brightness 2,400 lumensThe best contrast and luminosity excellentThe worst despite being a high-end projector, the displacement of the lens is manual3. Optoma HD30 This projector, like the InFocus, shows that nowadays it is perfectly possible to get a high quality home-projection equipment without spending a fortune. Their performance is not as attractive as many of their rivals, but they are still good enough that we have decided to include it in this selection. It has a very dignified dynamic contrast (25.000:1) and a competent brightness (1,600 lumens). But the best thing is that its price is really good. Officially costs 1,299 euros, but can be found without difficulty for 1,099 euros. OPTOMA HD30 FeaturesFull HD Resolution (1,920 x 1,080 dots)DLP Technology25,000 Dynamic Contrast: 1Brightness 1,600 lumensThe best very good value for moneyThe worst brightness and contrast surpassed by many of their rivals4. Sony VPL-HW40ES Although this is one of the cheapest projectors of Sony, its quality is beyond doubt. Like all the brand's proposals, it uses SXRD technology, which, as you probably know, is Sony's implementation of LCoS technology. But what's really important is their specs. Notable for its dynamic contrast (120,000:1), a brightness of 1,700 lumens, and, above all, a very interesting processing capacity, similar to that used by this brand on its TVs, which allows you to offer a subjective resolution and a really great color. SONY VPL-HW40ES FeaturesFull HD Resolution (1,920 x 1,080 dots)SXRD Technology120,000 dynamic Contrast: 1Brightness 1,700 lumensThe best overall picture qualityThe worst manual displacement of the targetSony VPL-HW55ES If miss a look at the specifications of this model and compared with those of the VPL-HW40ES realize that are essentially identical. Same design, same optics and identical contrast and luminosity. However, the HW55ES has something that its \"little brother\" lacks: the frame interpolation technology that allows it to offer a higher image quality in sequences with fast displacements, and also incorporates a more precise dynamic iris than, although On paper it offers the same contrast, it should ensure a better performance than the HW40ES in complicated sequences that combine very dark areas of the image with very bright ones. Includes two 3d glasses. SONY VPL-HW55ES FeaturesFull HD Resolution (1,920 x 1,080 dots)SXRD Technology120,000 dynamic Contrast: 1Brightness 1,700 lumensThe best your overall picture qualityThe worst manual displacement of the target and somewhat elevated priceSony VPL-VW500ES This projector is the dream of many moviegoers, among which I include myself. And not only because it is naively compatible with 4k content, but because it incorporates a good part of the innovations that have been put to the point of the Sony engineers for the \"flagship\" of the brand (you have it right below in this same post). If you want to know in detail the best I can do is invite you to read the deep analysis that we published in Engadget Smart home at the end of last year. what I said; A whole lujazo of projector.SONY VPL-VW500ES Features4k resolution (4,096 x 2,160 dots)SXRD TechnologyDynamic Contrast 200,000:1Brightness 1,700 lumensBest 4k compatibility and global image qualityThe worst is very expensiveSony VPL-VW1100ES And we come to that, in my opinion, is not only the best projector of the post, but one of the most advanced domestic devices that we can find currently in the market. VW1100ES is a product of ' big words '. Like the VW500ES model, it is natively compatible with 4k content, but it outpaces in two key parameters. Its dynamic contrast is 1,000,000:1, and its maximum brightness reaches 2,000 ANSI lumens. In addition, it incorporates all the refinements that have \"calved\" Sony image engineers, such as the latest versions of Motion flow Technologies and Reality Creation, among others. In technical terms, I can't put a single hit on it. Yes, its price makes it absolutely affordable for most of us. ",
