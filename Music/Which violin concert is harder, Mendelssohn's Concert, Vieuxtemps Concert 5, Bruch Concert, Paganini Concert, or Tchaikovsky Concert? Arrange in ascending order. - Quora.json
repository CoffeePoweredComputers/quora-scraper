            "answer_text": "In descending order from most difficult to least, I would rank the concerti as follows: Paganini: I assume you\u2019re referring to Paganini 1, which is probably the most difficult of his concerti. It was between this and Tchaikovsky\u2026 the reason I rank it hardest is because it\u2019s for one, very difficult, it\u2019s flashy and has a wide variety of difficult techniques. Tchaikovsky: It is also very challenging, debatably more so than Paganini. While it may not have all of the flashy techniques present in Paganini, musicality is incredibly difficult. As well, as Perlman put it, this concerto is not only technically difficult with advanced bowings and etc\u2026 it is also uncomfortable to play, I would say even more than Paganini. When you practice Paganini, the discomfort goes away\u2014somewhat\u2014as you play; however, when playing Tchaikovsky, the discomfort never truly goes away. Vieuxtemps 5: This is probably the piece most teachers will give you after you finish Mendelssohn. It\u2019s very difficult, flashy and uncomfortable. Mendelssohn: Mendelssohn is still pretty difficult, intonation and musicality are\u2014in my opinion\u2014more challenging than the technique in the piece, though, it still has a few challenging bowings and etc. Bruch: Of the concerti you mentioned, I would say Bruch is the easiest partially because of technique, and partially because of its length. The final movement is the hardest, comparable to the first movement of Mendelssohn. ",

I assume you meant \u201cconcerto\u201d. Let me start by saying that I\u2019m not a violinist. Henle Verlag publishes a scale where they rank each piece by level of difficulty from 1\u20139 and here\u2019s what they say : Vieuxtemps 7 Bruch 8 Mendelssohn 8 Tchaikovsky 9 They do not seem to carry any info about Paganini, but I\u2019d place it in this range 7\u20139 as well, just because it\u2019s Paganini and it cannot be any easier.
