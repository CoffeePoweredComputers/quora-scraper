            "answer_text": "There are very definite turning points that can surprise. For instance many 1960s bands sound well out of date. Take the Moody Blues my first favourite band sound like they never got past 1966 and that is about song writing and arrangement. \u2018Fresh Cream\u2019 is another example but here the issue is mastering where all of the stereo channels are so discrete as to sound like performances in different rooms and the panning sounds wrong to me in any case. Of course most of this is subjective but I have written elsewhere about the comparison between The Beatles \u2018Sgt Peppers\u2019 and the Grateful Dead\u2019s \u2018Anthem of the sun.\u2019 The former is a good record but sounds of its time where the latter sounds revolutionary and timeless today. Another good example is the difference between The Spenser Davis Group (Steve Winwood) and Traffic where the latter sounds much more modern. One could apply the same to jazz in very intersting ways.

            "answer_text": "Is That All There Is - 1968, sounds like it\u2019s from the \u201830s Those Were the Days - 1968 - but sounds much older\u2026because it was! It was recorded with the original Russian lyrics in 1925. What was new in 1968 was the English lyrics. (Thanks, Wikipedia!) The Best of Times Is Now - 1984, sounds like it\u2019s a French chanson from the 40s-50s - because it was written to sound that way for the musical La Cage Aux Folles. Many songs from the musical Follies, written as pastiches of older styles. ",
