            "answer_text": "Honestly speaking when they first debuted, only seulgi had the stage presence an idol needs to attract the crowd, she was and is AN ACE. Ace of the third generation groups as well. Other than Seulgi, red velvet's other members lacked stage presence which often comes out as \u201cboring\u201d.  I believe that they have improved over the years especially Joy. She was the member with the least stage presence but now in some performances, Joy has even supassed Seulgi.  The Zimzalabim era was the turning point for red velvet i believe. Even though Zimzalabim recieved a lot of hate, it still stood out the most. It was stuck in everyone's head, which shows how clever SM ent. is to put it as a title track. With this said, everyone's stage presence boosted up and I'm very proud of them.   I think Bad Boy\u2019s the devil of ReVeluvs. While it is a great song and got Red Velvet a lot of attention overseas and from other fandoms, now everyone expects them to stick to that concept. Not the velvet concept, because they aren\u2019t waiting for ballads, but the sexy one. And outsiders keep saying \u201cever since BB their music quality dropped\u201d, but bsides like Sassy Me, Taste, So Good are all velvet tracks of same quality and are just as good!   Afterall, no one is perfect, not you, not me, not even red velvet, although it's very important for idols to have stage presence, Red Velvet are improving. \u201cThere is always room for improvement\u201d To know more about kpop, kdramas and k-culture, follow and ask on KpopinIndia Happy Reading!
