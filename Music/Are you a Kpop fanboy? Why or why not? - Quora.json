            "answer_text": "I am a male. I always thought negatively about fangirls and fanboys until I became one. I used to watch X factor and a contestant on that show appeared on Kpop Star 4. I ended up watching that season as well as season 5 and 6. When season 6 finished, it was early 2017. By then, I only listened to Miss A but casually. Then in May 2017, my friend who was a Kpop fan introduced me to Produce 101 season 2. I began to watch the first season and I loved I.O.I. \u201cWhatta Man\u201d was the first track I found from them which probably helped me from turning away since it\u2019s an Korean rendition of an English song I knew. I kept up with the second season, but it was still airing so I had to wait for it to finish (btw Kim Samuel was robbed). In the meantime, I discovered that Somi from I.O.I was on a show called Sixteen which created Twice. I heard only one song before then which was \u201cTouchdown\u201d and they honestly looked dead inside during the performance (specifically Jeongyeon). I heard that Twice was really popular and I wanted to see what the hype was about. I then proceeded to fall in love with TWICE. I love their music. \u201cSignal\u201d was the first title track I saw and I was confused yet intrigued. Then I saw \u201cCheer Up\u201d and I was sold. Nayeon was my first bias, then I watched \u201cKnock Knock\u201d and it became Chaeyoung who is my current bias. I found out that Twice and Miss A were both in JYPE and I realized it was meant to be. From Twice, I discovered Blackpink then BTS then Red Velvet, then EXO, Gfriend, BigBang, SNSD, Pristin and so on. Most importantly, I realized in late 2017 that ASTRO was actually a Kpop group. I found them before I found Twice, but I thought they were just a dance group since I only saw their dance practices. I ended up going to see them in concert in New York in February of 2018. Why did I stick around this long? Because the music is really good. This was around the time when Pop Music started to be dominated by Rap and EDM which wasn\u2019t my preferred genre so I turned to Kpop. Also the choreography aspect was very visually appealing. The amount of talent in Kpop is insane. When I watched singing competitions, rarely did I ever hear male vocals that blew me away, but amazing male vocalists are everywhere in Kpop. Also the variety shows pulled me in. They make you like them as people instead of just their music. That\u2019s something I never had in American Pop music. My ult group is TWICE followed by ASTRO, NCT, and Stray Kids. The only problem is that I may spend a bit too much time in Kpop. Sorry grades. Sorry normal sleep schedule. Sorry parental expectations. Whoops ",

First kpop song I listened to was PSY\u2019s gangnam style years ago but It didn\u2019t made me a kpop fan. Then in around september of 2017 I saw BTS\u2019s Blood, Sweat, & tears video on youtube. I didn\u2019t understood a word they were saying but the video, music, & chreography attracted me. I watched their more videos & became an ARMY. Today I stan more than 20 kpop groups. Peace!
