            "answer_text": "Yes. $199 for a complete DAW workstation, which includes so many instruments, samples etc. Includes all functionalities etc, yes it\u2019s worth it. The question is, what are you needs? Are you primarily using it as a recorder or are you using it for electronic production? And it sounds great. And it\u2019s great on the CPU. It all depends on you and what background you are coming from. Are you coming from Pro Tools? Or Cubase? Or GarageBand? Or are you fresh, new off the block? For composition, it\u2019s indispensable, and dirt cheap too! ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re on a recent Mac and need a full featured linear DAW, Logic Pro is far and away the best deal to be had. In that case, it\u2019s \u201cworth it\u201d as nothing else comes close for the price. If you DON\u2019T need a full featured linear DAW, then there\u2019s no point to spending $200 USD on software you don\u2019t need. Ask a more specific question and you\u2019ll get a more specific answer. ",
