            "answer_text": "On a regulatory level, the FTC maintains a list of mobile health app best practices to help developers create high-quality apps that align with industry standards. When identifying the apps best-suited to their organization\u2019s needs, healthcare stakeholders should look for apps that possess the following features, as outlined by the FTC:  1. Minimal Data Collection Patient data collection requires careful scrutiny of industry regulations. The FTC recommends that mobile health apps collect data only if the data is integral to a product or service. Additionally, a well-developed app must be able to secure, transmit, store and eventually delete the data. 2. Limited Access and Permissions In an era of smartphones and apps that access everything from locations to contacts, many consumers don\u2019t question why an app would need to pull certain information. A responsibly designed app will use trusted user interface as much as possible, as opposed to direct API access, and use those trusted components only when it makes sense, in order to minimize unnecessary data collection. 3. Secure Authentication Healthcare records and information are valuable to patients, healthcare professionals and, unfortunately, hackers, so using authentication as a method of improving application-level security should be a primary concern during development. From the beginning, developers and owners should invest in designing, implementing and testing app authentication. If the risk of illegitimate access is high, options such as multifactor authentication should be considered. 4. Compatibility Mobile platforms differ by API, security features and permissions. A well-built app should be developed only after researching these differences, and it should adapt codes as needed to protect user data. These questions become more complex when third-party service providers are introduced. Responsible developers work to ensure data is protected, and they communicate their expectations and requirements to any entity they\u2019re working with. 5. Application-level Security Well-developed mobile health apps are built by companies that prioritize security from the ground up. At the minimum, one person is responsible for data security, if not an entire team. Engineers behind the app should have experience in secure coding practices or be trained as needed. Data security should be a priority at every stage in the app\u2019s lifecycle, from design to development to launch, all the way to post-market. Since healthcare threats are always evolving, security measures will need to do the same. 6. Resources for Security Improvements Security is a concern across the board, so naturally, multiple resources for improving application-level security exist. These come in the form of software libraries, software development kits (SDKs), cross-platform toolkits and free tools that can be used to improve encryption, navigate pre- and post-launch testing, check password strengths, test interfaces and reverse engineer programming code. 7. Clear Communication A well-designed app talks to its users in a clear, simple way. In healthcare, it\u2019s especially important to avoid jargon as much as possible. Developers should acquire clear consent before gathering any information, both during installation and at any point afterward, and the app must include an easily accessible privacy policy. 8. Compliance With Regulations For mobile health app developers, this can be especially challenging, since laws ranging from the FTC act, HIPAA and the FTC\u2019s Health Breach Notification Rule, to the FDA\u2019s Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act could apply to all, or parts, of an app. The collection of financial data, the data of young children (under 13) and even state laws will be factors in developing an app that is compliant with the proper legal environments. There are many other recommendations provided by organizations such as the FTC for creating the best mobile health apps possible. Wise developers, healthcare providers and businesses should review these best practices closely, as 2018 presents an exciting opportunity for the development of mobile health technology that produces truly positive outcomes. But if you ask me, then I suggest you to go with Uber Clone app company. They provide you 100% customizable script which is inbuilt with all latest features which are used in an healthcare app nowadays. But still if you want to add or remove any thing from the app it can be done easily. To check the demo version of an script visit play store and download Call'a Doctor app. And to know more about the cost and development connect with the team. ",

            "answer_text": "The healthcare field is extremely fragile. There is tremendous potential when you strike on the right idea but the wrong idea can cost you everything. From what I have witnesses healthcare service app would be successful. From the top of my head, few ideas I can think of: An healthcare app for accurate diagnosisIf budget permits, get into VR or AR to improve surgery success rateA communication portal to connect doctors worldwide to share treatment and diagnosis ideas, real-timeAn app for post surgery careThese are just few ideas about the healthcare scenario. But, the true best ideas come from solving actually problems doctors and hospitals come across. Try networking with some doctors and start understanding their process and uncovering problems they come across to help build an app that will succeed. And avoid building apps that are used as measuring tools for diagnosis purpose. We had a round up of the worst healthcare app ideas ever, and came across 5 healthcare app products that promised to measure and diagnose that were penalised by the FDA. http://innopplinc.com/blog/the-top-5-worst-healthcare-app-ideas-ever/ Also, when you do decide to build an app, then read these guidelines to ensure your app abides the law. http://innopplinc.com/blog/fda-mobile-app-guidelines-for-the-common-joe/ Then, decide which platform you want to enter - I would personally suggest an iOS app because the latest version has the ResearchKit and CareKit that easily helps you to monitor data and also track patient\u2019s condition. We are hosting a free webinar on the latest Apple\u2019s release and how it will impact the Healthcare industry. Our healthcare mobile app business analyst will help you understand it\u2019s potential better. http://innopplinc.com/webinar/how-ios-is-redefining-healthcare-in-2016/ Hope you get an idea that truly changes the healthcare field.
