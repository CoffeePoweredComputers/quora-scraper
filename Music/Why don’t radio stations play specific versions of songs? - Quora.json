            "answer_text": "It has been my experience that in top 40 there are \u201cradio edits\u201d that are usually shorter than the album version. These special edits are supplied by the record companies. Radio stations have to work in about 12 minutes of commercials per hour plus some DJ rap and promos so it is important to keep the song length somewhere around 3 minutes. Some stations where I have broadcast have sped up the songs from 45 rpm to 48 or so to make the song sound brighter and maybe work in an extra tune every two hours or so. ",
