            "answer_text": "It depends on what type of creative you are and how much power you need. As a creative myself i myself prefer PC (which i build myself) for anything Video and 3D, while if you are doing more design or illustration work there is way more Software available in Apple\u2019s ecosystem that supports artists and illustrators (if not all of them are Apple only). I would posit that those doing illustration do not need the increase of power that editing video and 3D require but reliability and portability and to be inspired by the device they are working on. They want to work on art to be inspired to create art. I felt the same when i was a graphic designer as well. They are not using these computer to the max like i did when i used Mac Laptops. I have owned 3x 17\u2033 Macbook Pros over 6 years and after a year of render video on each i would start to have huge issues with them which i found out later was because Nvidia made them shoddily, cutting corners to save money and then sued everyone until it was proven that they were the cause. This is why to this day Apple refuses to do business with Nvidia, which is a shame because Nvidia cards are vastly superior to AMD\u2019s cards for video editing and 3D production work. So in summation Artists, illustrators and graphic designers prefer Macs for the simplicity the software and the beauty while MOST IF NOT ALL PROFESSIONAL Video Production and all 3D/VFX artist prefer PC/Linux for the vast and superior hardware support and power and customization. (P.S. Macs have been using PC parts ever since they switched to Intel, which is also why the Hackintosh is possible. But Apple\u2019s marketing is epic and does a great job of convincing people into thinking they are getting a unique APPLE CREATED(not Apple assembled) product compared to other PCs on the market. I personally believe over the last few years (ever since the passing of Steve jobs) they have become less and less reliable in building laptops and even desktops. The only difference today between Macs and PCs is the Operation System and software. i also worked at the apple store for 2 years teaching people how to use the Mac OS so i am very familiar with the OS) ",

            "answer_text": "In the early days of personal computers, Macs were better tools for graphics. They had better displays and better software (first- and third-party). This stopped being the case quite a long time ago, but they still have that reputation. They also have a reputation for simplicity - another thing they might have once had but now either don\u2019t or are at best about equal to other systems. They also look pretty. Do not underestimate the \u201clook pretty\u201d. ",
