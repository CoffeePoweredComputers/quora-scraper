            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a critical thing that must be kept in mind about the first rock and roll song. It could not have been called that at the time of its release because the genre could not yet have existed. So the first Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll song essentially invents the entire genre. To find the first rock song we have to look in the genres that preceded what became known as Rock music. And that would be the gem \u201cHow Many More Years\u201d by Howlin\u2019 Wolf.  The timing. 1951 is when American culture was ready for Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll. The Wolf was there in place. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s the first Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll recording. Recorded by Sam Phillips at Memphis Recording Service, soon to be known as Sun Records,Ike Turner was the pianist,At 00:20 occurs the first recorded instance of the distorted electric guitar power chord, played by Willie \u2018Guitar\u2019 Johnson,String bass and percussion brought to the forefront rather than in the background as had always been the case in music previously,Steady prominent shotgun blast bass drumming driving the song with machine gun stick drumming by Willie Steele telling much of the song\u2019s story, notably at 01:00 (that distortion isn\u2019t your speaker: Willie is laying into his kick set so hard that he oversaturates the tube recording equipment of the day. You know darned well that Sam heard that and decided, \u201chell, yeah! that\u2019s staying in!\u201d. Which is the ultimate Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll attitude).The song has to be played at deafening top volume to be properly understood and appreciated as Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll. Be sure to do so: if by your 6th time binge playing the song your neighbors aren\u2019t banging on the wall and yelling for you to \u201cturn that sh!t down!\u201d, then you\u2019re not playing it loud enough.And there you have it. The essential combination of the adrenelin elements of what came to be known as Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll yet put into its then-contemporary genre as \u201cBlues.\u201d One of Rock\u2019s greatest exponents firmly believed it, as they agreed that a highlight of their band\u2019s career was sharing a stage with Howling Wolf in 1965. Below, Rolling Stones sit at the feet of the master himself:  ",
