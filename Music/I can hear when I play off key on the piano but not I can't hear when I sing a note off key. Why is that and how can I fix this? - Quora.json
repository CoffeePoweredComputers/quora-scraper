            "answer_text": "When you play piano, typically you are playing the melody and harmonic accompaniment at the same time, so you have a strong sense of the key.  The mistake you make happens within the harmonic context of the song, and so is more noticeable.  More simply put, if you are playing chords or a set series of notes with you left hand at the same time as playing the melody with your right (the memorable part of the song), a wrong note in the melody will sound obviously \"off key\", or dissonant, against the chords in your left hand. If you are singing unaccompanied (by yourself), you are singing out of context of a set key signature, and so it can be very difficult to stay within one key -   musicians call this intonation.  My best advice would be to find a way to sing along with something.  If you can play piano and accompany yourself while you sing, that would be the best solution.  Start by playing along with the same melody you are singing.  Play a phrase on the piano, listen, then sing as you play.  Once you are confident you have learned the melody, play a harmonic (chordal) accompaniment to give yourself a strong sense of key as you play.  Accompanying yourself can be difficult - your brain is focusing on a lot of things at once!  I would recommend recording yourself (or someone else) playing the accompaniment so that you can sing along if this is the case for you. If you are singing along with music and you are still having problems with your intonation (singing incorrect pitches, or you tend to sing flat or sharp), your ear just needs a little more training so that you can focus on the accompaniment that you are hearing and match the pitch.  Go slow, work small sections, just as I recommended above.  Listen, sing along, and repeat.  Practice playing notes and melodies on the piano and matching them as best you can.  Pitch matching and intonation can be trained and improved relatively easily, it will just take some time and effort on your part! ",

            "answer_text": "Just a theory... In addition to what Erika said, if you miss a note on the piano, you will be off (most likely) either a half step or whole step (in the context of the key). Things don't work out so mechanically when you're singing.  Think of if you were trying to tune a guitar by slowly tightening or loosening the tuning pegs.  You will notice the note increase (or decrease) in pitch toward the next half step \"gradually.\"  My theory is that you could \"almost\" hit a certain note while singing, but not quite.  When this happens, to the ear, it sounds \"a little flat,\" as opposed to the wrong (half step) note being sung (i.e. an entire half step difference).  Since the difference between the target and the actual can be very small while singing, it is harder to detect than the very obvious note flub on the piano. ",
