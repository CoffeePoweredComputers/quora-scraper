            "answer_text": "The process for an international student is a little more tedious with applications and visas and such, but in general, you go through the application process and then set up an audition in one of their stations worldwide. You can also go to the Boston campus if possible. There\u2019s an actual instrument-based audition where you play a prepared piece or an original composition, and then you do a few other tests so they can assess where you\u2019re at. After that you do a sit-down interview with a representative where they just ask you some questions\u2026as far as I remember, there wasn\u2019t any psychological trickiness; just questions about your musical life and why you want to attend Berklee. All the finer details are outlined in the application process material. At the end of it all, if they see potential and promise in you, or you just blow them away (or both), then you\u2019ll most likely be accepted! ",

            "answer_text": "There are several things to take into consideration. First, do you play an instrument, second, Berklee will want to see if you have some type of talent with music. When you go for the audition, they will test your skills through a series of them clapping a rhythm and you clapping back the exact rhythm. After this comes sight reading which you do not need to be the best at but it is beneficial so you will not have to take and pay extra courses while in Berklee since Berklee is already a very expensive school. This is a very general layout but if you have any other questions feel free to ask :) ",

If they think you\u2019re good enough, you\u2019re in.You should know that the program is very intense. I don\u2019t remember a single party. It was constant never ending huge amounts of work! Classwork needs a lot of participation and homework is heavy. Then you\u2019re required to join performance groups and go to nightly concerts. So, while it\u2019s not tough to get in if they think you have talent, it\u2019s very hard to STAY in! You really need to be devoted. I hope that helps. Go knock \u2019em dead! ",
