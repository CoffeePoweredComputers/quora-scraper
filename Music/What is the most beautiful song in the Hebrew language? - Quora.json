            "answer_text": "This song is a unique, ancient prayer, put to a lovely, haunting melody. I had many 5 hour drives last year and sometimes found myself listening to this over and over again. (The prayer has been adopted by popularized Kabbalah, but don't let that get in your way. Info: http://www.neohasid.org/resources/ana_bekhoach_liturgy/     A better known song, with amazing intertextual lyrics, is Lekha Dodi, a centerpiece of the service that welcomes the Sabbath. Numerous melodies. Yikes. Looking for a version, can't resist posting the boisterous (not Ashkenazi!) group:   For info on this group: Israeli trio breathes new life into old songs I suspect for a modern Israeli classic, many would choose one of the folk anthems of Naomi Shemer. Then there is a beauty in this, though it seems like forgotten and naive dream at times:  ",

            "answer_text": "So, two of my favorites, Yerushalaim shel\u2019 Zahav and Lekha Dodi, were nominated by the others\u2026 Okay, no problem, there\u2019s more where this is coming from ;) Let\u2019s start with (in my opinion) a very beautiful and surprisingly (when you are listening to it for the first time) very sad song, How shall I bless him? by Rachel Shapira and Yair Rosenblum.  \u201cWith what shall I bless him, how should he be blessed, this child?\u201d asked the angel.\u201cWith what shall I bless him, how should he be blessed, this child?\u201d asked the angel. And [the angel] blessed him with a smile as pure as light, And blessed him with eyes, big and seeing, to grasp every flower, and life and bird. And blessed him with a heart to feel all these sights. \u201cWith what shall I bless him, how should he be blessed, this youth?\u201d asked the angel.\u201cWith what shall I bless him, how should he be blessed, this youth?\u201d asked the angel. So [the angel] blessed him with legs to dance endlessly, With a soul to remember all the music, With a hand that gathers shells on the beach And with a tentative ear to listen to the young and the old \u201cWith what shall I bless him, how should he be blessed, this young man?\u201d asked the angel.\u201cWith what shall I bless him, how should he be blessed, this young man?\u201d asked the angel. And [the angel] blessed his hands, used to flowers, to master the power of steel, His legs - to dance marching the roads, And his lips - to sing the rhythm of commands. \u201cWith what shall I bless him, how should he be blessed, this man?\u201d asked the angel.\u201cWith what shall I bless him, how should he be blessed, this man?\u201d asked the angel. \u201cI've given him everything I\u2019m allowed to give:The song, the smile, the legs to dance, The gentle hand and the singing heart\u2026With what can I bless you more?\u201d With what shall I bless him, how he should be blessed, this child, this gentle youth?With what shall I bless him, how he should be blessed, this child, this gentle youth? This boy, now he is an angel,No one will bless him anymore, he will never be blessed again.Oh God, oh God, oh God, If only you have blessed him with LIFE...  Now, our next contestant is\u2026 well\u2026 not too refined, if you know what I mean. Some would call it kitsch. But you know what? The following video of soldiers, fresh out of the combat zone, singing and dancing to it, touches something in me. \u201cMi she ma\u2019amin lo mefakhed\u201d (He who believes, is not afraid) by Eyal Golan:  Everywhere and alwaysWe all (from young to old) haveNice days\u2026 and less nice ones\u2026And between them there is an answer to all the questions There is one great G-d,And in this world he gives us everything.Between the darkness and the ray of lightWe just have to choose our path. And it is known that life is a gift.All is foreseen yet free will is granted[1] The one who believes, is not afraidOf losing faith!And we have the king of the world,And he is protecting us from everyone. This nation is a family.One plus one - this is the secret of success.The people of Israel won't give up,We always stay on the map! And it is known that life is a gift.All is foreseen yet free will is granted The one who believes, is not afraid... There is a big commandment to be in happiness,To be always in happiness The one who believes, is not afraid...
