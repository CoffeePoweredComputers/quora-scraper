            "answer_text": "You\u2019re probably expecting an answer bashing some popular group, like BTS. Or one dissing a group everyone loves to hate on, like Momoland. Who knows, you might even find a list of several groups the the writer finds fake. Maybe that writer even went anonymous, hiding behind a gray profile picture and no clue to their real identity. No matter what group I put up here, I\u2019ll at least be able to find one person in the crowd who agrees. But honestly? All K-Pop groups are fake to some extent. However, if something is fake, does that necessarily mean that it\u2019s bad?   If you don\u2019t recognize this group, the name T-ara might ring a bell. There\u2019s a lot of controversy surrounding the actual story behind the whole bullying scandal that surrounded the group, but the basic gist is that one of the members threatened and bullied her fellow groupmates. But on stage, I doubt you\u2019d be able to tell that anything was going on behind the scenes. It\u2019s as if there was a figurative curtain that divides what we as fans see and what is really going on.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with this picture, as far as I can see. But I know that one of the girls in this photo threatened to break the other\u2019s bones and scratch up her face. The dynamic that the world was supposed to believe was a group of girls who liked each other and were a team of talented idols. That wasn\u2019t true, as we all know now that the truth has been revealed. But I don\u2019t see anyone not listening to T-ara\u2019s songs despite this scandal.  About four years ago, I had swapped schools due to my district changing the way they operated some of the grades. I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t a bit scared of the sudden change. On the first day, a girl with blond hair and the brightest blue eyes you could imagine came up to me, and introduced herself. She helped me learn my way around the school, make some new friends, among other things. I was incredibly grateful to her. I still am. About two years later, I was getting ready to move again. We were sitting on a stone bench, swinging our logs above the ground, just soaking up the afternoon sun and reminiscing about our earlier years. Here, she finally confessed to me that a teacher had told her specifically to help me, among a few other students who had also swapped schools. The difference is, although our friendship had started out as fake, it still had grown to something beyond that. I didn\u2019t remember her as the girl who was told to befriend me. I remembered her as the girl who tried to dye the tips of her hair pink and winded up with a bizarre shade of orange. I know this is cheesy, but I honestly didn\u2019t care how our friendship started out. I cared what it turned into after.  Similar to this, many K-Pop groups are given concepts that they follow as soon as they debut. A member that might be incredibly smiley off camera could have to act as a mysterious, moody brat that dislikes everyone. This, for a lack of a better word, is fake. Take the curtain I brought up earlier. It\u2019s the divider between what companies want us to see and what\u2019s really going on. But beyond this divider, are people. These people behind such concepts aren\u2019t. They still are humans, that cry and smile and laugh, just like you. And that\u2019s the part that isn\u2019t fake. I\u2019ve met plenty of people who dislike K-Pop, which I get. Even I dislike it to some extent. But a vast majority think that fans don\u2019t know exactly how fake K-Pop really is. We do. Trust me. It\u2019s practically impossible to ignore the more you get into the industry. Then why do we \u2018stan\u2019 or support these idols? Because we realize that there is a real person behind all of that autotune and censorship. A person who might have a nice voice, an good rap flow, or sharp dancing. Hell, they might just have good songs that you enjoy with good production. I refuse to call any group \u2018fake\u2019 because truth to be told, they are still living-and-breathing organisms. Maybe some aren\u2019t real artists, but they are real humans. Real humans that can have feelings. Feelings that can be hurt. And I think that\u2019s important to remember going forward. ~dy. n ",

            "answer_text": "Divya Nair\u2019s answer focused on deeper artificial idol personalities. I\u2019m going to take another route.  All four of these Korean idols share one commonality: plastic surgery. In fact, the entire concept of their group was based around their surgical enhancing experiences. Six Bomb is a K-pop girl group that gained infamy for the fact that its members have all publicly underwent extensive plastic surgery. Enhancements included breast augmentations, nose jobs, double-eyelid surgery among others. Furthermore, the group\u2019s two-part comeback, titled \u201cBecoming Prettier (Before)\u201d and \u201cBecoming Prettier (After)\u201d, detailed the girls\u2019 experiences before and after plastic surgery. While Six Bomb isn\u2019t quite an anomaly in the K-pop industry\u2019s relationship with plastic surgery, it is the first group I know of to openly base their entire concept around it. This highlights a highly contentious and popular debate on the use of plastic surgery within South Korea. According to an article from BBC News, more than 60 percent of women in their late 20s had plastic surgery in the country.[1]The issue has attracted enough attention that the South Korean Ministry of Gender Equality and Family released controversial guidelines addressing \u201clookism\u201d and increasingly identical features among popular Korean acts.[2][3]  Plastic surgery is a choice that people make. I do not support nor object to the use of appearance-enhancing surgical procedures. However, I do wish that people undergoing procedures fully understand the life-lasting consequences that stem from their choices.
