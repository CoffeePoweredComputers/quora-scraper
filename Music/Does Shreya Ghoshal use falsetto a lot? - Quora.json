            "answer_text": "No! She never uses that. I can understand what made you ask such question but you need to understand that she is talented. She is practicing from a very young age. At the age of 4 she started practicing. And at the age of 16 she won Sa Re Ga Ma which was a boom for her career.  It took almost 14 years of practice to reach there. It was her immense practice and dedication that she was able to achieve it.  We all know that we\u2019re left with only few artists who have true talent. And we should be appreciating that.

            "answer_text": "I understand that its hard to tell especially in the higher notes because she is a true soprano with a very feminine voice. But she really uses a mixed voice 99% of times even when she is singing very high notes like C#6 in Bhor Bhaye from Delhi 6. Most clasically trained Indian singers don't use head voice or falsetto much. ",
