            "answer_text": "Not nearly as much as you think. I've personally dealt with what I imagine Kanye West feels when someone asks this question my whole life, and I have a clear understanding of the worlds misunderstanding, if you will. First, one must disect the meaning of narcissism/arrogance/cocky. The definition people usually ignore when choosing to judge Kanye is one that describes inherent (born with) feelings about one\u2019s capabilities. Instead, they jump straight to the fact that Kanye believes in his abilities, and isn't afraid of anyone knowing that\u2014and falsely label him as a narcissist. If you woke up tomorrow and said, \u201c\"I'm going to work my butt off and accomplish some amazing things today\u201d would anyone call you arrogant? Alternatilively, if you woke up tomorrow and said, \u201c\"I don't really feel I need to work hard today; however, due to the fact that I'm so amazing, I'm still going to accomplish some amazing things today\u201d. Do you see the difference? Additionally, people that don't understand what it means to be a black youth raised in America will always confuse the bravado and and self-confidence that black men have with arrogance. If you knew how little black men are told that they can accomplish anything, or be/do anything that they set their mind to, then you would understand the struggle and arduous journey it took for a person like Kanye to get to the point where he was even confident, let along, society\u2019a version of arrogant. I lived what Kanye\u2019s lived through, and get told almost everyday that someone feels I'm \u201ctoo\u201d arrogant\u2014if they only knew the journey black men take to simply feel they're good enough to take a stab at a college education, or simply believe in their own God-given abilities, they'd realize, \u201cdon't judge a book by its cover\u201d should be applied equitably, regardless of the color of a mans skin (REF: why most Americans are rooting for Irish McGregor over American Mayweather).
