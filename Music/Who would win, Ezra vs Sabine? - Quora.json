            "answer_text": "Sabine, honestly. She\u2019s a Mandalorian, from house Vizsla no less. It\u2019s in her blood, and she knows what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s more resourceful and combat-wise: she\u2019d know how to react better and faster than Ezra. Without his (somewhat lacking) training and Force abilities, he probably couldn\u2019t beat two battle droids at once. Sabine\u2019s been fighting the good fight a lot longer than him, and she\u2019s been through most of the Imperial Academy on Mandalore. There may come a time that Ezra\u2019s abilities surpass Sabine\u2019s, but for the time being, she\u2019s a badass and he\u2019s\u2026 well, significantly less of a badass. ",
