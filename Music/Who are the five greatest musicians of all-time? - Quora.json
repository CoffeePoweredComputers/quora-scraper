            "answer_text": " The \"of all time\" part of this question makes it difficult for any rock-pop musician to make the cut. Classical and jazz are so much more intricate and complex forms of music than rock or any form of pop, that the greatest masters of these forms are likely to be able to play rings around the best of rock-pop. One exception might be progressive rock. If any rock artists can compete, it is likely they belong to this sub-genre. That said, let's give this a shot.  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - As a composer of course, he is unmatched for his time and maybe a contender for all time. But if we're talking musicians, anyone on this list must also be a virtuoso performer. Mozart already was on both piano and violin by age 5. Niccol\u00f2 Paganini - Italian violinist, guitarist, violist and composer, the most celebrated violin virtuoso of his time. Some clergy were convinced he must have sold his soul to the devil to gain his stunning virtuosity. All the instrumentalists in the pre-recording era must be suspect of course, but surely his compositions offer a clue to his claim as the best ever. He wrote what remain, by far, the most difficult pieces of violin music of the world\u2019s repertory. Franz Liszt - Again, regarding Liszt and all those above, no recordings exist which we can compare. We can only compare what was said of them. It could well be that other piano virtuosi exceeded Liszt (Chopin, Thalberg, Busoni in the 19th century; Hofmann, Rachmaninoff, Vladimir Horowitz, and Vladimir Ashkenazy in the 20th). Recordings do not exist from many of these. Both Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Sebastian Bach were reported to be among the greatest virtuosi of their time as well. Certainly their compositions provide a clue, some of which require uncanny technical mastery just to play, but the above n0 recordings problem holds true for them as well. We cannot know for sure. Louis \"Satchmo\" Armstrong/Miles Davis/Dizzy Gillespie - These are jazz trumpeters. In jazz, it seems even more difficult to choose one over another for sheer technical virtuosity because their improvisational styles were so different, yet all so masterful. John Coltrane/Charlie Parker - The same problem holds true for jazz saxophonists... Thelonious Monk/Art Tatum/Marcus Roberts - ...and for jazz pianists Oh my, you said 5 didn't you. I've already mentioned 20 names and still have not covered the progressive rockers I hinted at, nor any guitarists except for Paganini. OK, to be fair, let's give the following guys a shot. Keith Emerson - If anyone outside of classical or jazz can even approach mention as one of the 5 best ever, it would have to be Emerson, though some may say Rick Wakeman. Guitarists - Sorry shredder fans. If there are any possible guitar players that deserve to be named among the best musicians of all time, it is probably not a pure electric guitar shredder. The reason is, the guitar can do many things, and lead guitar shredding is one thing. It's true that some of them are also excellent acoustic guitarists and/or rhythm players, but for the most part, they are one-trick ponies. Therefore, if any guitarists are to make the cut, they will have to be overall masters of the instrument. If truth be told, it is more likely a classical guitarist who fits this bill, since classical/concert music is so much more demanding than any contemporary  pop or rock style. Someone like Andr\u00e9s Segovia, the father or the modern classical guitar, or one of his many descendants still active today, such as David Tanenbaum, Craig Ogden, or even Xuefei Yang (Chinese born guitarist who, if she were chosen, would be the only female to make this list). But since we're trying to give someone other than classical musicians a shot, we would have to choose a versatile master such as Al DiMeola, John McLaughlin, or Phil Keaggy the nod. These guys can all shred with the best of them, and also play many other styles, much more complex than shredder rock. Sorry, that's the best I can do. I know you said 5, but I still think it was a monumental feat to narrow the list to 29, and I still left out who knows how many great masters. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is impossible to answer, but it's fun to try, so here I go. Note that I'm interpreting musician as musical ability, basically rating their musical creations and ability to create. Bach. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Bach is in the top five. When considering the baroque masters, Bach almost always comes out on top, and being almost universally considered as the best musician of an entire musical period definitely warrants his name being up here. In my opinion, if his cello suites were his only surviving works, he would still belong here. Bob Dylan. I can almost feel the eyebrows being raised at this choice, but there are a few important things to remember here. There is still a lot of debate out there about who the greatest rock artist is, but basically nobody would be pissed if you said, Bob Dylan. I mean, this won a Nobel Prize in poetry, for God's sake. Mozart. When talking about classical music, this is the guy you want. Him and Beethoven are usually pitted against each other at number one, with everybody else just trying for second place. In terms of classical music though, nobody else really compares. You can tell when you're listening to Mozart, and you can tell when you aren't. And it's better when you are. John Coltrane. Note that I hate the lack of women on this list as much as everybody else, but even today women simply can't break into the industry as easily. But check out Coltrane's second wife, Alice. She has some\u2026 funky stuff. Anyway, listen to A Love Supreme. The work he did there and repeated elsewhere was simply transcendental. His music, even compared to most Jazz, is unique. Fela Kuti. Alright, I know that I'm going to get shit for thus fifth guy, but listen to his music. I have trouble describing it, but in terms of emotional power, he surpasses even Coltrane. This list probably won't be seconded by all, and I did literally no research for it just went off the top of my head. But I think it's a pretty good list. ",
