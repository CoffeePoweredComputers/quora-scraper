            "answer_text": "Its just because some fans really just like to ship other people. It's nothing serious as far as I know. People in kpop especially find it hard to believe that a male and female can be friends. Just don't pay attention to those kinds of rumors. Unless its confirmed by the company or idols themselves. Then you can also support their relationships because a lot of kpop stans thinks that their idols are just objects of their pleasure and will start attacking them. ",

But still this needs to be stopped. Bts doesn't like it. And they do get in trouble for this, not only bts but red velvet and other groups too. So if you care about them you need to stop. ",
