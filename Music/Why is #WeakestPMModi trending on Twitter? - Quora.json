            "answer_text": "The country is already suffering from the wrath of CoronaVirus with more than 350,000 cases as of 16th June 2020, China is creating another havoc like the coronavirus on the border.  Image Courtesy: Google Images. After a bitter faceoff on the India-China border, Twenty soldiers were martyred on the Indian Side in Galwan Valley, Ladakh. This is the first time in the past 45 years that any border dispute between India & China has escalated on this scale. Also, 43 PLA soldiers were killed and many left injured. The opposition is pissed off on the government which according to them has not taken any serious actions against the dragon who violated the integrity of our motherland. I salute the sons of the soil who laid their lives in protecting our motherland.  I, as a responsible citizen, will not be a warmonger but seriously urge the Modi government to take strict actions and give China what it deserves.  Image Courtesy: Google Images. Currently, a meeting is underway between the army generals to defuse the border situation, and parallel Rajnath Singh is monitoring the ground situation and briefing the Prime Minister about the incident. But unfortunately, rather than supporting the government on this issue, The opposition is trying hard to perform a political maneuver and defame the Modi government as being weak and incompetent. We as Indians should unite as one single unit rather than being divided into factions. I urge the Modi Government to take strict action and stand with the Government. Jay Hind! Thanks for reading. ",

Yesterday at the ladakh border with China , near Galwan Valley , there happened a bloody slaughter of soldiers of both the sides. 3 indians soldiers and 5 chinese PLA soldiers lost their lives and 11 chinese PLA soldiers have been injured. Indian citizen came out on Twitter to address our not so strict indian government and their steps they took to tackle the situation. 3 Indian army soldiers are killed yesterday at China border. Had this been happened at Pakistan border, All of BJP & it's media would be barking like dogs. Why so silent now?    ",
