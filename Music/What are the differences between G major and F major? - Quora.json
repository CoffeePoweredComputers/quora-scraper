            "answer_text": "Well I can\u2019t tell if you mean the chords, triads, of G major and F major or just the notes G and F. I\u2019m going with the triads. Start at any note. That becomes the first or bottom note of the triad. Count up a major third interval or four chromatic steps {white AND black keys). This note is the second note of the triad. For the final note count up an additional (from the second note) MINOR third interval or 3 chromatic steps. Doing this process starting on F gives you and F major triad. The same with G, a G major triad. There is a formula for progressing chromatically by pitch. An octave contains 12 chromatic or half steps. An octave contains all the named notes in western music. From there they differ only by pitch. start with A. A at 440 Hz. twice that is an octave, 880 Hz. Another A but an octave higher. to get the frequency of a pitch in between the two As, multiply the first A, 440 by 1 (to set the starting point at 440) plus 12th root of 2 (880) for one chromatic half step.
