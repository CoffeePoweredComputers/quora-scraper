            "answer_text": "First of all choose 1 DAW(FL STUDIOS or Ableton) and stick to it. Don't go out there and try to learn to use as many DAWs as you can. I personally recommend FL studios for a beginner as the community is really big and can find alot of help online. Now on how to learn to use it. thats a hard one! What i did was play around with the software for ages!. Twist some knobs, press some buttons and see what they all do. Also there are tons and tons of beginners tutorial out there on youtube you just have to find them. But i my opinion the best way to learn is to start making some beats! Start from making a simple kick and snare pattern and work your way up think about what you want to add to it in your head and try to make that in the software. If you can't figure it out then go online to forums or youtube and try to find how you can do that one thing that you want to do. Now one thing you have to accept is that you aren't gonna be making a banger of a track in a few days and become famous and make millions. It's gonna take you years to learn all the bells and whistles of music production, given that you aren't gonna be sitting there 12 hours a day 7 days a week trying to learn how to make music. There is no one who is going to hold your hand and walk you through music production. You are on your own bro. you have to find ways to learn yourself. You have to put in the time and effort. Over the years I've made several tracks. And one thing I've noticed is that i keep getting better with every track i make, and that reflects on my music. So my advice to you is you will learn only by making tracks yourself. No matter how bad the track you made is. I promise the next one will be better! Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many tutorials for fl studio beginners by many youtubers. Just search specifically, like piano roll beginner guide, harmor guide, mixer guide, etc. You can also press F11 which will explain you everything in text and also contains videos. Don't go for 3rd party plugins until you learn the basics. And try to learn stock vsti they are very powerful, many people just don't know that. Now I would like to clear something here. If you want to learn production just by looking at how big is the commercial music scene is then STOP. It requires a lot of musical knowledge, talent and most important for music production is EARS. You mixdown and mastering of a track can make it or destroy a track. Now here comes the market, music industry has grown after the introduction of edm. Everyone wants to be a producer/ dj for which you will definitely need to make a lot of expenses. For studio flat monitor speaker, for 3rd party vsties, for sample pack, for midikeyboar keyboard, for good computer, etc. Music industry is very dirty and not how it looks. I hope this helps. If you need any help then follow me and send me your queries. ",
