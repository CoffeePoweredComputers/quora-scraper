            "answer_text": "A car seat is different from an airplane seat. One important function of the car seat is to protect the driver and passengers in the event of an accident. The purpose of the headrest in a car seat is to reduce whiplash injury in the event a rear end collision.  This is a nice review from Neck Solutions: Here is what happens in a rear end collision with an improperly adjusted head restraint:   \"Many people refer to the head restraint as a head rest - a comfort feature, however, head restraints/headrests are installed in vehicles as a safety feature like seat belts. Good head restraints reduce the rearward motion of the head in a rear end crash and decrease the chances of sustaining a whiplash neck injury. In fact, you're more likely to need the protection of a good head restraint than the other safety devices in your vehicle because rear end crashes are so common.\" \"Findings show that head restraints positioned at or above the head's center of gravity can reduce reported neck pain after a whiplash neck injury. Drivers with such restraints reported 40% fewer instances of neck pain than those with poorly positioned restraints.\" \"Having a poorly adjusted head restraint or one that cannot be adjusted properly to the height of your head in your vehicle is a major risk factor for increasing the severity of whiplash neck injury during a rear end collision. This is when the car seat head support can help. View the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Head Restraint Rating to get an idea of how your car's head restraint rates.\" \"Take the time to adjust your head restraint if you have a good one, or use the car seat head support if you do not. This may prevent a lifetime of disability.  Step 1: Adjusting the Height of Your Car Seat Head Restraint: A low car seat head restraint can cause injury as the head pivots over the top in a rear end collision. The first step is ensuring the correct height. Adjust the head restraint up or down until the center of the head restraint at least meets the center of the back of your head or higher.Step 2: Check for Forward Head: Every inch your head sits forward of the restraint magnifies the force of injury to your neck. In one recent crash test performed by the Center for Research into Automotive Safety and Health, having the head forward by two inches significantly magnifies the force on the head. \"The the distance between your head and the head restraint (backset) should not be more than 4 finger breaths. If you can't get your head that close, then consider the Car Seat Head Support as an add-on to your headrest for proper comfort and protection.\" \"If a head restraint isn't behind and close to the back of an occupant's head, it can't prevent a \"whiplash\" injury in a rear-end collision. Institute researchers regularly evaluate the geometry of head restraints in passenger vehicles based on the height and backset relative to an average-size male. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.

            "answer_text": "Car headrests don\u2019t exist. Cars have head restraints, designed to limit the movement of occupants\u2019 heads in the event of sudden stops. They are designed so they are a short distance behind the occupants\u2019 head and should have the upper rear part of the skull contact the middle of the head restraint. This will cushion and then stop rear movement. The movement should be small enough to prevent whiplash injury. As with many automotive questions, read the owner\u2019s manual. It will explain how to correctly set up and use the head restraints. ",
