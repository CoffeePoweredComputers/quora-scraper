            "answer_text": "That depends on the type of music and volume you listen to it at, and if you use headphones. If you listen to loud metal as you fall asleep (not making that up.. there was a guy who literally told me he does this sometimes) or rock music, then that\u2019s probably not good. It may cause damage to your ears over time and some sounds may wake you up or just disturb your sleep cycle and get your sleep rhythm off. Also, if you use headphones to listen to your music (no matter the genre), you also have to be cautious of the cord. If you move around in your sleep a lot, headphones might not be a good option. But if it\u2019s soft music, or calming or dreamy music or something that relaxes you then I think that would work best. I sleep with music on every night. Sometimes I take a nap and listen to music in headphones (thankfully I don\u2019t move at all in my sleep), and most nights I play music from Youtube via my tv and fall asleep that way. Here are some good examples of what I think are great songs to listen to when going to sleep.. I listen to these songs frequently (either putting them on \u2018loop\u2019 or repeat on my phone):     I also listen to Progressive house sometimes when I sleep. BUT I have to put them down a little lower than others. But they get me to sleep pretty well and I always wake up feeling refreshed. The only \u201cdownside\u201d is sometimes I am too busy enjoy the song to actually fall asleep haha   While these kind of songs can help you relax and fall asleep faster, and stay asleep or have a nice(r) experience sleeping, any music in general is fine to sleep to. I used to sleep to just the normal radio, usually on oldies music, christian music, classical, or pop. But yeah, there really is no issues with falling asleep to music.The main issue is just volume mostly. ",

            "answer_text": "It's about the habit you've developed before sleeping which makes you . The ideal peaceful and refreshing sleep should not have any visual and audio inhibitors. This usually distracts the brain from going to complete rest. It might seem right now that it aids you in sleeping but you are actually sleeping by tiring your brain.  While playing music while sleeping it keeps the brain partially active and reduces the efficiency of your sleep. Will make you feel tired sometimes and will reduce the quality of your sleep.  It's absolutely alright to listen to music before going off to sleep but that too softer tunes like jazz, indie, soul or chillstep and minimal beats. Edm and trap isn't such a good idea before sleeping either. But switch off from everything including lights, music, phone , pc , tv before going to sleep. It'll take some time to get used to it but it's like developing any good habit ! ",
