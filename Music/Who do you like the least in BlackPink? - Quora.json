            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t necessarily dislike her, I just dislike the way that YG treats her. (This could be any member lol) But the member I \u2018dislike\u2019 is\u2026 drumroll please Jennie Kim. I dislike the way YG markets her compared to the other members. She\u2019s always centre, always wearing the nicest clothes, and always gets the best things before the others. Take Solo for example. It\u2019s a bop ngl, (but it\u2019s kinda rushed\u2026) however it\u2019s slightly boring because YG didn\u2019t give Jennie enough time to prepare it properly. But my other pet peeve is that she got her solo first. A long, long time ago. We\u2019re only getting confirmation of Ros\u00e9\u2019s solo being remotely real just now. Nothing for or from Lisa or Jisoo. However, I doubt that Jisoo will even have a solo. I mean we\u2019ve seen from their choreography to start with that YG has his\u2026 how do I say this? \u2018Favourites\u2019. Or even \u2018princesses\u2019. And Jisoo isn\u2019t one of them. Neither is Ros\u00e9 though sooooo\u2026 there is still hope that she\u2019ll get a solo. {allow me to reiterate that i\u2019m not hating on jennie, i love her to bits, she\u2019s just been put on a pedestal by YG and those are some of the things that come with it.} Anyway, thx for reading!
