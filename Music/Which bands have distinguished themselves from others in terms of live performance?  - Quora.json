            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been to a lot of shows but some really stand out more than the others due to the presentations and props. Still, it\u2019s the MUSIC that counts, Without that, you\u2019re just prancing around and going thru the motions. Here are some of the most dynamic shows I\u2019ve ever been to: RUSH - seen them five times. They pulled out all the stops - video short song-intro films, flaming clay pots, giant balloons, laser beams, everything. So perfect, so precise. That\u2019s the best thing about it all but the worst thing as well - that didn\u2019t give RUSH much time to converse or interact with the audience much, if even at all. Nevertheless they were one of the greatest live bands ever. RIP NEIL PEART. PINK FLOYD - videos, light shows, lasers, etc. Trippy experience. (JEFF LYNNE\u2019S) ELO - they were already well known for their groundbreaking innovations in musical style, recording techniques and live shows but last year\u2019s performance that I went to wasn\u2019t just all that. It was a dream come true alright but technology advances have made their show even better than it could\u2019ve been when I was a t(w)een. The video technology, sound advancements and the KILLER laser show made this ELO show even more exciting than ever, and that says a lot! WOW, BABY. U2 - you can never tell what these Irish dudes might come up with. When I saw them for the 2nd time (1997) they had a mockup of a market entry arch with a red mock basket hanging from it, a parody of consumerism (this was the \u2018POP\u2019 tour). They donned starship uniforms to board a lemon-shaped \u2018starship\u2019, it landed from a pedestal and then they debarked back onto the stage. The \u2018lemon\u2019 was raised up and its surface switched to reveal a mirror surface. This \u2018lemon\u2019 disco ball spun as U2 kicked into the hit \u2018Discotheque\u2019. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. I love U2. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - he gives it his all, four hours+. Set list never the same twice and he often digs up b-sides, unrecorded stuff he wrote and other goodies. PETER GABRIEL - avant garde and unpredictable. That\u2019s a complement. ROLLING STONES - Sir Mick\u2019s showmanship and body language. You have to WATCH him, not just hear him. RUSH wrote a song about such stars, \u2018Superconductor\u2019. Say no more. GEORGE CLINTON - certainly not the only or even the first \u2018funkateer\u2019 I\u2019ve ever seen live but with his wild and crazy (comical and FLAMBOYANT) persona he puts on an energetic show that will electrify you and knock your socks off. Never mind all the inspiration he has made with Funkadelic/Parliament as well as solo. Seeing him onstage is a trip, he is dynamic and totally NUTS!!!!!! LOL Plenty of others. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of great answers already so I\u2019ll try not to be redundant with a couple of exceptions. I have to fully support 4 answers Kiss was an awesome live band, they\u2019re the ones that rewrote the book, Alice Cooper is cool as hell live seriously anyone who can decapitate themselves live and keep singing gets my vote, Iron Maiden are consummate professionals who are tied for the most under appreciated bands ever, and of course The Grateful Dead the band that never quit touring for decades thousands of shows and no two are the same. If you\u2019re able to see some form of The Dead even now it\u2019s a spiritual experience not just a show. Deep Purple may be the best concert I have ever seen. Perfect Strangers tour. LOUD but really clean and tight. Highway Star was performed in three segments through the show with incredible solos built in the sing breaks naturally. I left with my chin on the ground, utterly awestruck. The Dixie Dregs/Steve Morse Band The other band tied for most under appreciated. A stage full of guys that can do anything with their instruments. The kind of guys that give professionals lessons, the kind of guys that teach at Jilliard and Berkeley. If you want to witness pure musicianship it just doesn\u2019t get any better. The Ramones were in a class of their own. 3 hour shows with the only break between songs being 1\u20132\u20133\u20134! A guy I saw them with the last time stated \u201cit was like getting hit in the face for three hours\u201d\u2026.. yeah, it was kinda like that. Mannheim Steamroller is another troupe of amazing musicians. These guys collectively can probably play every instrument that exists at a professional level, seriously. The Christmas shows are nice but if you can catch a spring or summer concert you\u2019re in for an unexpected treat. There are countless other great live bands I\u2019ve seen through the years but these are the ones that really jumped out. ",
