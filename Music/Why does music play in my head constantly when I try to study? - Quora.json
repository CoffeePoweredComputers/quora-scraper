            "answer_text": "A2A by Curious Well you are facing concentration issues. Honestly speaking, I actually play music while studying. It helps me in concentration. I would refer NCS, background nature sounds, rainymoods.com, and ticking sound of clock, which are among my favorites. These sounds help you enhance your focus on the task on hand and also helps me prevent sleep when I am studying at night. And initially I used to think that such students who used to study with noise in the background are actually decreasing their efficiency but as i turns out after trying it for myself, I would say that it helps. What you need to think about is that these songs should be sounds preferably because they don\u2019t attract you to sing along. Further, if you want to listen to songs, make sure that you have already heard them a lot and there\u2019s no new thing that may catch your interest when you don\u2019t want to. The reason hat you hear music in the background because sub-consciously you believe that the music is much better than boring studies. Even if you consciously don\u2019t believe so, you can\u2019t help it. To get your sub-conscious on the right path, just talk to it about it. Yes the sub-conscious brain picks up on your thoughts and just the same way it picked on the fact when you were thinking that music is so great, you just need to think about taking interest in studies.
