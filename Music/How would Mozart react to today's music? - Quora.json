            "answer_text": "Wailin\u2019 With Wolfie Swingin\u2019 At The Opernhaus I set my Geochronology Meter for Vienna, May 1st, 1786 A.D. I arrived in Old Vienna under cover of dark and began cautiously exploring its streets. Eventually, I identified a clothiers and it was a simple matter (for me at least) to enter the establishment and abscond with attire more appropriate than my desert robes and leather pouch. Nothing fancy, just a dark coat and waistcoat, breeches, white stockings and shoes. I\u2019ll admit I scoured the shop for cash and found enough Austrian thalers to finance a brief stay in the capital. Now, I was off to the opera \u2013 to be specific, the world premiere of Mozart\u2019s Le Nozze di Figaro. Ah, the Vienna Opera House, the gaiety, the high fashion, painted ladies and bewigged men arriving in ornate carriages, the exterior lit by torches and candles, and a clear, star-strewn 18th century sky overhead. It would have been even more enthralling if I actually liked opera, but I don\u2019t. My idea of a superb operatic voice was Whitney Houston, back in the 20th century, but that\u2019s another story, and not a pristine one. Basically, I was just looking for Mozart, the ultimate icon of classical music. It wasn\u2019t easy, as this was his big night. I hailed a parked carriage and paid the driver to wait there on one side of the plaza until the evening\u2019s festivities were over. Mozart finally emerged sometime after midnight, descending the great stairs of the Opera, a celebrity surrounded by adoring hangers-on. I recognized him from the record albums. His fans finally surrendered him and his voluptuous young lady into a waiting carriage and off he went. \u201cFolgen Sie diesem Wagen,\u201d I barked to my driver, and we took off after the composer. It must have been a couple of kilometers later when Mozart\u2019s carriage turned down a dark, unlit street. Figuring he must be close to home, I quickly paid the driver and followed on foot. Indeed, the composer\u2019s conveyance had stopped halfway down the street. I watched from a recessed alcove as they ascended some stairs and entered their shabby looking apartments. After a decent interval, I approached his door. Be resolute, I thought, and knocked forcefully on it. I heard steps approaching and the woman opened the door. Mozart\u2019s wife Constanze! \u201cWas w\u00fcnschen Sie?\u201d \u2028Fortunately, I\u2019d been forced to study German during the late 25th century when we had made an attempt, in 1921, to use the noted gay surrealist Franz Aufgenheiser to seduce Adolf Hitler into a life of artistic and sexual debauchery. Adolph resisted, however, probably due to shyness about his one ball. In the end, the only sign of his intense psychosexual struggle was the cute way he combed his hair over his forehead. Me, I felt we should have just wacked the motherfucker out when we had the chance, but the Grolnathians are pacifists and I would have lost my time-traveler status in a heartbeat. Constanze wanted to know my errand. \u201cIch habe eine wichtige Mitteilung f\u00fcr Herrn Mozart!\u201d I whispered. \u201cAn important message?\u201d she said, looking suspiciously at my soiled white stockings. But then Mozart himself, in a vermillion waistcoat, teetering slightly, came to the door. I should have been speechless before the great man but then, I\u2019d just been eating fish with Moses so rarified heights were nothing new to me. \u201cHerr Mozart,\u201d I began, \u201clet me be honest with you. I am a visitor from the future. I know, you must think I am crazy, but look at this!\u201d From my pocket I pulled out my 26th century iPod 827. It has the expandable holo-screen and the levitating speakers that floated at various distances from the unit. Seeing it deploy, Mozart and Constanze staggered back in fear and tried to close their door. \u201cEin Gespenst! Ein Gespenst!\u201d \u201cNo, no! I\u2019m not a ghost! Hear me out,\u201d I cried in my halting German. \u201cIn this machine are the musical secrets of the future! Please, give me your reactions. You are a great genius Herr Mozart. Your name will be honored down the centuries. But what about Chick Corea? He\u2019s not chicken liver. You might be interested in his work!\u201d I have to hand it to Wolfgang, he hung in there. \u201cUnd vaht ist diese Tchich Koriya?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a 20th century pianist, very accomplished. See, for us in the 26th century, his music is a kind of classical music. We still love yours, but...look, can I come in for a few minutes?\u201d Constanze shook her head, still terrified, but Mozart showed who wore the breeches in the family. \u201cJa Zukunftmann, k\u00f6nnen Sie hereinkommen.\u201d That was nice. He\u2019d called me \u201cFuture Man.\u201d He showed me to the parlor where a magnificent white pianoforte stood. It reminded me of John Lennon\u2019s, so on an impulse I strode over to it, flapped back the tails of my waistcoat, seated myself and began to play \u201cImagine.\u201d After eight bars Mozart had it figured out, cleared his throat gutturally and spat into a flower pot. So much for peace and love. \u201cOK, I\u2019m sorry about that, Herr Mozart.\u201d I got up from the pianoforte and levitated the iPod 827 again, floating it against one wall of the little apartment. With a mental command, I brought up holographic footage of Jacques Loussier, a noted jazz interpreter of classical music, playing Bach\u2019s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. I saw Constanze peeking wide-eyed from behind a doorway, her face white as a sheet.\u2028Loussier began playing, descending through these altered dominant chords, the drummer was sizzling on his high-hat, and the bass player was swinging hard. Mozart looked confused, then unimpressed. \u201cAch, er ist Improvisieren auf Bach. Jeder kann es tun.\u201d \u201cAnyone can do it? But not everyone can swing like that.\u201d \u201cSchwingen? Waht ist diese Schwingen?\u201d \u201cSwing is like...\u201d Then I noticed one of his elegant 18th century slippers was tapping to the beat. It was time to transition to the next phase: a live performance of Chick Corea performing at the Tokyo Blue Note with an all-star band. I cued up a tune he\u2019d written called \u201cBud Powell,\u201d a lilting, accessible melody, to 21st century ears. Hearing the crisp piano intro, Mozart got the strangest look on his face. Chick\u2019s hip chords and rhythms must have been the equivalent of seeing a fusion jet-cruiser hovering outside his window. Then the alto sax player stepped up to play the head. Wolfgang\u2019s eyes bugged open. He started blinking and cocking his head to one side, then the other, like a pigeon in a powdered wig. \u201cWas ist das goldene Instrument gibt?\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a saxophone, man. That will come around in another hundred years or so.\u201d \u201cUnd warum gibt es so viele Afrikaner?\u201d \u201cOh, those guys? Well, jazz combines African feeling and rhythms plus Western harmonies. The ancestors of the black guys were all American slaves. You must know about\u2026\u201d I looked down and saw he was tapping his foot again. But his eyebrows were clenched together in pain at the dissonant chords. When Kenny Garret took his solo, he cried out, \u201cAber er spielt all die falschen Noten!\u201d \u201cNo, Wolfgang \u2013 can I call you Wolfgang? \u2013 they\u2019re not false notes, just extensions of basic dominant and minor chords. They got tired of that simple shit. See, Charlie Parker, he...\u201d \u201cSchweigen! Seien Sie ruhig!\u201d He wanted me to shut up. I did. But when Roy Haynes went into a drum solo, he started to get upset, about to flip his wig \u2013 literally. So I switched to another piece, an elegant, meditative ballad featuring Joshua Redman on tenor. Mozart calmed down. He sensed Joshua\u2019s virtuosity right away. \u201cDas Saxophon klingt wie ein betrunkener Fagott, aber Ichmag es.\u201d Great! He liked the tenor, even if he did describe it as a \u201cdrunken bassoon.\u201d And when Chick took his solo, Mozart\u2019s head actually began nodding in approval. Next came Christian McBride\u2019s bass solo. \u201cAber das Pizzicato Bass ist genial! Wundersame!\u201d \u201cBrilliant, miraculous!\u201d Christian McBride had a new fan, though one who had been dead for 756 years. Mozart was a fast learner, far more open- minded than I\u2019d expected. Time to take him to the next level: \u201cTrinkle, Trinkle,\u201d with Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane. The Tokyo Blue Note dissolved from view and now we were ten rows back at the legendary Carnegie Hall concert in 1958, Trane and Monk looming before us as they took off on one of the craziest, arrhythmic, breakneck-speed riffs in jazz. This was the test, because Monk always sounds a little out of tune with his deliberate dissonances and strange melodic intervals. Mozart leaned back in his seat, scowled, pulled a lacey handkerchief from his embroidered left-sleeve and began to mop his brow. Trane was going nuts, running scales like a heat-seeking missile. Monk was plunking outer space note clusters every five and a half beats. \u201cIt\u2019s all 11ths and 13ths and altered scales, Wolfgang,\u201d I shouted \u2013 \u201cvery advanced stuff!\u201d Monk\u2019s mouth was hanging open. Sweat was dripping off his chin onto the keys. Ahmed Abdul- Malik on bass and the drummer Shadow Wilson were locked into the groove. Trane\u2019s eyes were closed in fierce concentration. Suddenly all hell broke loose. Someone began pounding on the wall next door, shouting \u201cStoppen mit L\u00e4rm, Herr Mozart! Stoppen mit L\u00e4rm!!\u201dConstanze began whooping in terror in the bedroom. Meanwhile Mozart had leapt up and tried to enter the holograph, waving his arms, yelling \u201cAfrikaner aus! Afrikaner aus!\u201d I heard a whistle blowing outside. Someone had called the cops. It was time to get scarce. I grabbed my iPod 827, clicked it off and made for the door. As I headed outside I glanced back and saw Wolfgang Mozart standing in the middle of his room with a plaintive look on his face. I heard the clip-clop of a police wagon coming, so I took off down the block and then quickly around a corner and hid out behind some trash boxes. I heard voices shouting, \u201cHe went that way,\u201d but the wagon sped past my hideout. Lucky break. I got out my hyper-flux wave reader, ready to hone in on the Locus Oil I\u2019d rubbed on Moses before I left. That\u2019s when I heard the soft tread of 18th century slippers approaching my hideout. When you\u2019ve been in this business for 286 years, you can hear stuff like that. It was Mozart, of course. \u201cVy are you leafing now FutureMan? Vy don\u2019t you take me vith you? I can speak ze English a little! I vant to learn more about ziz... ziss...JassMusik!\u201d \u201cWolfgang, your place is here in Vienna. My advice is to focus more on your health, actually. Look, why don\u2019t you work on a passage with some diminished 4ths and 7ths, a sort of serial chromaticism thing for one of your late symphonies?\u201d \u201cVat do you mean \u2018late?\u2019\u201d \u201cUh, nothing, nothing. You hang in there, man. It was great meeting you.\u201d And in a flash, he was gone. And so was I.

            "answer_text": "At first he would be appalled. For 2 reasons: 1. he is (way way way way) beyond the age where people keep up with new music. There are a host of articles on the internet about how the music we listen to as early teenagers sticks with us and that very rarely adapt our styles and preferences beyond that point because new music doesn\u2019t appear to have as much influence on people as they get older. 2. He would hate its simplicity. As labels have become more and more powerful, they keep looking for dumber and dumber artists to milk money from. At this point you dont even have to be good, just be good looking, and be dumb enough to sign your life away and then you\u2019re welcomed with open arms. The other thing thats happening is that since people dont study music anymore, bedroom producers end up just throwing simple crap into a DAW (digital audio workstation) and showing it to their friends. Couple the simplicity, with the record companies who want dumb people and finally the fact that teenagers want fame to get girls, you have the perfect recipe for an army of teenage producers in the top charts who like writing in the key of C. However, had Mozart been born in this time he would have very much loved this type of modern music. You forget that he was very much obsessed with money and power and fame through his music. In comparison to Bach and Beethoven he was also quite simplistic. Bach had once wrote a duet for violin where one violinist read the sheet music right side up and the other upside down, that takes an extreme understanding of how music works, Mozart never did anything quite like that. He was also very much the pop producer of the three, he often added a multitude of extra flourishes to his pieces and higher runs that the young people these days would call \u201cso extra\u201d. His pieces were written in a time where his music was popular and I believe his mind would be with the contemporary public. He\u2019d be all like \u201cyo fam this sh*t is lit AF!!\u2026 Yeet!\u201d ",
