Start several social media accounts like YouTube, Facebook, twitter, instagram, etc\u2026 And start doing vocal and dance covers on posting them online. And start performing at local talent shows and kpop festivals, etc\u2026 It's important to be connected with your fanbase.Then, you should start learning korean! If you want to be a kpop group it is a requirement that your group speak fluent Korean and know Korean culture.Then, if its in your budget, take some vocal and dance classes to help improve your skillsThen, after your group gets comfortable performing together you need to come up with a concept for your group and a group name. Do you want to be cute, sexy, hip hop, girl crush, etc\u2026 And come up with a name based around that. Its always good to do mood boards for thisThen, start making your own music! You music should match their concept of your group! Start with releasing singles that lead up to a ep or mixtape.

            "answer_text": "Typically, if you were wanting to sign under a label such as YG, SM, or JYP, then it would be nearly impossible to get a group together and go through to debut. The normal routine that the companies take is to audition different people and then select a few to become trainees for a few years. After a long period of training (singing, dancing, modeling, etc.) they will bring together a few of the trainees to start a pre-debut group. If they have the talent and chemistry that the label is looking for, they'll debut as a group. It sounds as if you wanted to make a group before approaching a label. I suppose the best way to do this is to train (VERY hard) and audition for 'Superstar K' or the like and hopefully make it through so one of the labels will notice and give you a contract. For each of the members, speaking fluent Korean is a definite must, and having a main vocalist and someone who can rap as well as other vocalists is a good way to start. ",
