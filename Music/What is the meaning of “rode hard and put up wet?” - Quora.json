            "answer_text": "This was originally, to my understanding, a horseman\u2019s term. The horse was a very important part of many households, plowing fields, working lands, and sometimes still taking family into town for supplies & to Sunday church,& community events. Because of this, it was widely known that one should not run a horse until it is hot,& lathered, or wet with sweat,& then stall/stable the horse, without proper walk-out/cool-out period, liniment bracing, rubdown, etc- all the proper care given such a useful animal. So, generally, it means means some thing or some one that has been used hard, but not well kept up. For instance, let\u2019s say one is looking at a newer but used automobile,& noticed scratches, dents, problems with interior, oil leaks, fluids not filled, etc.; just general maintenance obviously not done/car not well taken care of for its age. The assumption would certainly be that the vehicle\u2019s been \u201crode hard & put away wet\u201d. ",
