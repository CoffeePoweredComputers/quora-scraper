            "answer_text": "Around the release of VHIII EVH did an MTV interview where he walked Chris Connelly through his home studio, 5150. Besides being an enlightening video that also shows Eddie\u2019s affability and passion for all things music, he shows a wall of shelves with unreleased music on it. Chris even asks him if we will ever get to hear any of it. Chris quips that he thinks it would be a \u201cdream job\u201d to plow through it all. Eddie says no one could because no one knows what he likes. This implies there are good and usable things on those tapes. This isn\u2019t an answer to your question so much as it is proof that there are hundreds of hours of recordings that one day, we may yet be able to hear bits of. Wolfgang might tackle the project. This is only speculation of course. The interview is in this linked YouTube video. Go to 2:29 to see the wall of tapes.  ",
