Nobody knows about this, and I wanted to tell the world myself, not through a spokesperson. The last 18 months were the darkest phase of my life, and I wasn\u2019t in a state to talk to anyone. I know there were rumors that I was in rehab (for drug overdose), but I was in my Noida house throughout. The truth is I was suffering from bipolar disorder.

I had a beard and I didn\u2019t get a haircut for months. For someone who has performed in front of a crowd of 20,000, I was scared of facing 4-5 people. That\u2019s what bipolar disorder does to you,\u201d Honey said. Via Times Of India  Honey Singh, who once used to address thousands of fans is now afraid to talk to four to five people today.

We wish him good luck and a very soon recovery.  ",
