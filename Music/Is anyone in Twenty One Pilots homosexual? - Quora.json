            "answer_text": "Tyler Joseph of Twenty One Pilots had been married to his wife Jenna since 2015, and they have a baby on the way. So that'd be a no for him. Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots has been engaged to Debby Ryan for about a year now so I\u2019m gonna say no for him as well. Considering the fact that they\u2019re a two-piece band I would say that the overall answer is no. Of course, it is technically possible that either one of them could be using their partners as a cover for their secret homosexuality, but that is very unlikely especially for mainstream musicians in the US in 2019. Questions like this kind of annoy me because you could easily find the answer with a quick google search or even just scrolling through their Instagram. Not to mention one of their more well-known songs \u201cTear in my heart\u201d very clearly talks about someone's love for a specific woman the entire time. ",
