            "answer_text": "Guitars are very personal items - there are a number of brands, makes and private luthiers who produce good quality acoustic guitars, your question specifies \u2018intermediate\u2019 players so obviously you have mastered the basics. You are now ready for a decent instrument which can see you become a player of quality! Now this purchase will depend on your budget, you can pay anything from $500 to $50,000 for a \u2018decent\u2019 quality guitar (and a lot more if you want a vintage, rare guitar). If you have up to $1000 to spare I would suggest a Taylor, Ibanez or Godin instrument. These three businesses produce really high value instruments and you are not paying out for the brand hype. Godin are a Canadian company and use some excellent timber, they are not as well known but I have been impressed by their guitars. Ibanez are Japanese, and the value of their work is really exceptional. Taylor is close to my heart as I chose one of their guitars for my most recent acquisition and I play this guitar most often at home :) My personal guitar cost me $1000 and I am very happy with it, it is well made, stays in tune and has a rich, sonorous tone with plenty of volume if needed, plus it has on-board electrics which produce a very true \u2018acoustic\u2019 sound. I was comparing a Martin Mahogany model with my Taylor and I was convinced by the Taylor even though I secretly wanted the Martin to be better! So this is as genuine a recommendation as I can provide, take a look at some of the Taylor models in your local music shops, you are sure to be impressed. Also, don\u2019t forget the second-hand market, you can pick up some real bargains if you search the used guitars on offer - I have found some beauties over the years, if they have been well cared for this is a great option.

            "answer_text": "You are lucky to be looking for a guitar at a time when inexpensive guitars are better than they have ever been! I won\u2019t suggest one brand, but have been pleased with guitars from Blueridge, Eastman, Takamine, Ibanez, Yamaha and Recording King as well as Martin and Taylor. If your budget allows, a higher-end guitar will really inspire you, but there are plenty of lower cost instruments that sound great and are easy to play. Look for these features in whatever guitar you consider: Solid spruce or cedar, not laminate, top. Back and sides don\u2019t matter as much.Good tuners (Schaller, Grover, Gotoh or similar quality)Balanced volume between bass and treble stringsGood build quality - smooth fret ends, low action, accurate intonationAssuming you are looking for a steel string flattop guitar, here are some things to consider to narrow your focus to the guitars which would be best for you: Are you a flatpicker or a fingerstyle player? Flatpickers generally prefer a narrower neck width, fingerpickers like wider necks.What size guitar body is most comfortable for you? While the dreadnought size is very popular, a smaller body like a OOO, \u201cgrand concert\u201d or even a parlor size might be a better fit for you.If you play up the neck, consider a cutaway for easier access to higher frets.Mahogany-backed guitars have a different sound than rosewood-backed ones. See if you like one better than the other. Likewise spruce versus cedar tops.You want a guitar that will delight and inspire you. That will get you to spend more time playing, which in turn will improve your skill. ",
