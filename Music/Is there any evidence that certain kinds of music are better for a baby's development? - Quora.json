            "answer_text": "This is a controversial topic that has come to greater public awareness in the last 20 years.  Reading up on the issue, you often hear of the \"Mozart Effect\", \"Beethoven Effect\", or \"Bach Effect\".  As a former music major, I'm sad to say there is not strong evidence to suggest that exposure to music guarantees any measurable impact on development.  However, there have been a number of studies that seem to suggest that listening to some types of classical music (particularly Mozart's K448) can lead to short-term improvements in both IQ and spatial-reasoning.    The strongest evidence I've seen for a positive effect is from a study that came out of the University of Wisconsin - Madison that tested the effects of music on mice for those exposed in utero plus 60 days post partum and found improved performance in maze exercises.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9664590 Other popular research usually referenced with the topic has come from Alfred Tomatis (1991) and Rauscher et al (1993). Having grown up in a musical household and playing instruments/singing from childhood to adulthood, I do believe the mathematical underpinnings of music (especially classical music) help children with pattern recognition which leads to stronger performance in math, science, and deductive reasoning.

            "answer_text": "If an infant's parents drink fine wines, drive a Volvo, and live in a mansion this is good for the baby's development.This principle can be logically derived from a classic Volvo commercial.As it happens both my parents owned and played a variety of musical instruments when I was an infant: a marimba, piano, portable organ, violin, trombone and accordion-not counting the radio and record player.The records were almost all classical.The difference between the world I grew up in and today, is all the kids I knew had parents who played musical instruments and taught their children. One friend wrote the words and music to several  songs that in standard use by Christians all over the world. He did this in Chile at age 11.If there is no TV and no video games, and your parents play musical instruments every day, and there are classical records, this is likely to have some influence. If you just added a little classical music to a diet of noise, I do not see why one should expect any result at all.",
