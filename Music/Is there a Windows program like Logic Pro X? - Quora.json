Have you looked at Sonar, or Cubase, both of which can produce excellent results? As a Brit, I'm baffled by the popularity of FL Studio questions on Quora, as I've never met anyone who uses it, though I've come across people using other software. Maybe it's an American thing. My favourite magazine, Sound on Sound, with an international readership, has monthly columns for Sonar, Pro Tools, Logic, Cubase, Reason, Ableton, Reaper and Studio One, but never a mention of FL Studio. They also sometimes cover Digital Performer, which has an enthusiastic professional following and is very well established. Have a look at Presonus Studio One, which comes in a free version which can be upgraded. You can also find a lot of free plugins on KVR, both effects and instruments, to expand any of these DAWS (apart from Studio One\u2019s free edition) when you need to. Reaper is a very powerful program you can download to evaluate and then pay for eventually, but it might be a little complex. ",
