            "answer_text": "This is a ridiculous rabbit hole designed to prevent people from focusing on real conspiracies like 9/11. As far as I can tell, it all started with Jay-Z being accused of being a Freemason, which, by the way, is no crime. West is signed to the label Jay-Z created. Just to give some perspective, the Illuminati was a historical society bent on world domination that began as a nest inside Freemasonry. They have been accused of fomenting the French Revolution, and possible involvement in the American Revolution as well since almost all the leaders of that were Freemasons. At the time, most of Freemasonry was pretty much under British control while the Illuminati was created by a German orphan raised by Jesuits. The system invented by the Illuminati involved secret cells under secret masters with new members writing long histories of their lives that could be read by the masters so they could better direct their activities. Do some study on Skull and Bones at Yale University and the similarities with the Illuminati will immediately strike you. Which is not to say this has been a continuous power structure, but that the elite who actually rule this world have ways of keeping things organized so power is carefully transferred from one generation to the next. I seriously doubt Kanye West has anything to do with the power elite and this story is probably being amplified to keep mud in the water on this issue. In this regard it reminds me of the \"Paul is Dead\" controversy that occurred in the late sixties with the Beatles. ",

            "answer_text": "the illuminati is actually a broad term for a vast collection of various occultic, social, and scientific divisions. This includes red, white, and black magic, Rosicrucians, Evolution, masonic lodges, fraternities and their latter part, dozens of music artists, the world health organization, and many pagan religious practices. Particularly, Kanye West has stood alongside several music artists and public figures who have done illuminati signs, such as 666 and the All-seeing Eye. If you ever bother to look it up, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s no wonder why people say such offensive, yet accurate claims pertaining to the man. ",
