            "answer_text": "I think the media coverage depends where you're looking. The clip from Top of The Pops of Bowie singing Starman (which I\u2019d tried to put in here, but the links seem to have been removed by Youtube) is fairly legendary in gay circles. As the chorus ends in the Li li li li li li part, Bowie and (the rather manly Yorkshireman) Ronson sing into one mic, and David puts his arm around Mick. It\u2019s as gay as it got in 72. He definitely had sexual encounters with men, mainly as a teenager and in his 20s. I gather that the open relationship he and Angie had was rather \u2018anything goes\u2019 and many of the same sex encounters would be as part of threesomes including women. He certainly flirted with the gay community, although whether with gay men is debated. I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but I remember reading a comment when he said about meeting a lad \u2018and neatly fucked him, thinking, well, if I ever go to prison I know how to stay happy\u2019. I would think the actual sex was about experimentation, and not love, but he although (as others here say) he was a closet heterosexual, he seems to have kept his options open. The rumour about Mick Jagger also, of course, never went away. Whether or not he was gay himself, and there\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve heard to suggest he slept with men after the 70s/early 80s, he certainly played on it, and knew that he had a big gay following. On the Sound and Vision Tour 1990 he dedicated John, I\u2019m Only Dancing to anyone gay in the audience. The song, about a gay man dancing with a straight woman and hence annoying his boyfriend, is not a subject that say, Rod Stewart would have broached (despite Stewart also being very gay-freindly, see The Killing of Georgie). Other notable gay songs: QueenbitchBoys keep swingingVelvet goldmine (took me years to work out it\u2019s about anal sex)Rebel rebelBut the gayest lyric would be from Width of a Circle, which details a number of sexual exploits and I\u2019ve copied below. He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips And showed me the leather belt round his hips My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame He said you'll never go down to the Gods again (Turn around, go back) He struck the ground a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said do it again, do it again (Turn around, go back) His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said do it again, do it again (Turn around, go back) ",

            "answer_text": "My best friend ever was an unconcealed gay man and he told me this story in 1981, when he was 30 or 31. I knew this man very well for many years and in my opinion he did not make up or embroider stories through exaggeration.   In his early twenties he saw David Bowie in concert when he was promoting Hunky Dory. After the concert Bowie approached him (don't ask me how--it's not my story) and said, \"Didn't you notice? I was staring at you throughout the concert.\" He invited him to join him at a restaurant for dinner.  During the dinner he either held his hand or leg or was playing footsie with him under the table, or some combination of the above.  Angela Bowie was right there at the table with them and the entourage and she was furious.  I don't remember the story (if I was even told it) of whatever the rest of their interaction was but my friend did not claim, in fact he denied, that he ever had sex with David Bowie.  However, my friend, who was a student, shared an apartment with a roommate. One day (or night) the phone rang and the roommate answered the phone, and called my friend over saying \"It's for you. It's David Bowie.\" Bowie insisted on seeing my friend again and they agreed to go to a certain gay bar. There was dancing at this bar but I forgot who was dancing, and with whom, and also someone kissed someone, but regardless, my friend had a boyfriend who was there and who did not take the evolving situation well.  He punched my friend in the face.  In my imagination I have always visualized the scene as in those old comedy westerns where someone is punched while lying flat on his stomach on the bar in an old fashioned cowboy saloon and barrels down the length of the whole bar to the other end.  My friend was not injured but said he was very humiliated.  How embarrassing, getting punched out  right in front of David Bowie.  That's the end of the story as I remember it and I will never forget it.  My friend was a great storyteller but I have never known him to be a liar.  Sadly, he was an early victim of the AIDS epidemic and is no longer with us except in the memories of me and other friends. But if (as I believe) this story is true, then I would say that David Bowie was at least a little bit gay. ",
