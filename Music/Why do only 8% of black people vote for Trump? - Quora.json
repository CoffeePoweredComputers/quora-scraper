            "answer_text": "LMFAO, I have no idea why only 8% vote Trump. That\u2019s way too many in today\u2019s environment in my book. As far as I\u2019m concerned there is a lot validation to Biden\u2019s comment about black supporters of Trump. The Republicans and Trump show their true feelings about kneeling depending on what color you are. I personally don\u2019t condone violence as a response to an obvious miscarriage of justice, but I understand it. It\u2019s a response after years of being trod upon. The injustices have been going since the first boat of slaves arrived in this country. There is a documented history of the white man\u2019s impunity to crimes against people of color. Only recently there\u2019s now a federal law against lynching. I could go on but enough said. If you step back and try to look at the issues, there has been very little response as to what is going on in today\u2019s society. The present Republican administration, react to the symptoms of the miscarriage of justice ie, protests and riots, but don\u2019t go after the root cause of fear of losing their base. We are all Americans if we are born here and we should unite to try to eliminate this miscarriage of justice no matter what Ethnicity you are. ",

            "answer_text": "Most blacks vote Democrat regardless of who runs. Actually President Trump picked up in the Black Vote substantially over previous Republicans. The reasons for this are profound and worthy of study but the question is do they\u2026. It is a good question since when the George Floyd matter came up, there was an attack and charges of racism against President Trump and in fact he has always spoken in favor of dealing with the matter. He said what happened seemed wrong to him. You must remember when some demand he speak out more strongly on the matter that President Trump is constrained by his office not to taint a Jury Pool so he basically cannot do as some demand and say the officer is guilty. If he did the case would be destroyed. He really can only say his feelings of sympathy. ",
