            "answer_text": "The Wanamaker organ in Philadelphia is reputed to be the largest functioning pipe organ in the world, with nearly 29,000 pipes in 464 ranks. Specifications can are found here: Wanamaker Organ - Wikipedia. That said, the actual largest organ in the world is not entirely playable and hasn\u2019t been for many years. Located in Boardwalk Hall (the former Convention Center) in Atlantic City, this immense beauty has four records in the Guinness Book: including \"Largest pipe organ ever constructed\", \"Largest musical instrument ever constructed\" and \"Loudest musical instrument ever constructed\", and holds several records in the organ world. It is one of only two organs in the world to have an open 64-foot rank, and the only organ to have stops voiced on 100 inches of wind pressure (about 3.6 psi). Its console features seven manuals. The eight chambers contain 33,114 pipes, controlled by the most massive console in existence. Wiki reports that It has 1,235 stop tabs controlling 587 flue stops, 265 reed stops, 35 melodic percussions, 46 non-melodic percussions, 164 couplers, 18 tremolos, 120 swell pedal selectors for the six swell pedals controlling 15 swell boxes, and a stop crescendo pedal. The console is also the only one in the world with seven manuals. The lowest two (Choir and Great) have a range of seven octaves, and the next lowest (Swell) has a range of six octaves, while the rest have a normal five-octave range.

Besides the massive array of pipes, pneumatics, & as many as 7 manuals plus a pedalboard, the acoustic properties of the room in which it\u2019s located are inseparable from the sound producing mechanisms. A room may be designed, or architecturally modified, to best conduct & complement acoustically the sounds coming from the pipes. Pipe organ at Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, largest in the world:  An insider\u2019s view:  Convinced? Any questions?:  Since the design of the room is critical to, & an inherent part of, the sound of a pipe organ, they function as an integrated unit in determining the sound. The audience at a pipe organ concert is actually sitting inside the instrument, which may be large enough to accommodate thousands of people.  ",
