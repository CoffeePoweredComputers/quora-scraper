            "answer_text": "It's funny that I stumbled across this question after hopelessly Googling 'why is singing so hard' after a particularly frustrating practice session that nearly had me in tears, and now I've written about three pages worth of a reply which I offer to both you and myself whenever I\u2019m at those low moments. Here is what I think are the reasons why singing is challenging: You cannot be tone-deaf I could sit you down in front of a piano and teach you where all the notes are. Then, I could pull out sheet music and teach you how to read it. After that, you just practice daily for a year or two and VIOLA, you can play piano. You do not need to have a musical ear. You can literally sing 'Happy Birthday' out of tune, but you can still absolutely sit in front of a piano and play a song written on sheet music as easily as the CEO's secretary can type on a keyboard (no pun intended). Can you do that with singing? No, because that makes no sense. How can you sing 'F' if you don't even know what that sounds like? You can use online/app tuners to help you figure out if you're playing the notes right, but even that's not so straightforward. There are professional violinists and pianists who play by ear, but when it comes to singing, they might find themselves struggling. Why? This brings us to our next point. This instrument is invisible Unlike pianos, guitars, flutes and such, when singing your instrument - your voice box - is hidden inside your body. You can't see what you're doing, so you're going to have to feel it from the inside out. Also, you can't even hear what you're doing - sound is totally different inside your head than it is outside of it. That's why most people hear recordings of themselves just speaking and are surprised to the point of asking \"do I really sound like that?\". Because the sound you hear in your head as you sing is deceiving, the only way to really make sure you're doing it right is to feel. You can only do this after ear training and many singing lessons where a good teacher has guided you towards sensations that indicate you are doing it correctly (e.g. there is pressure in your diaphragm and your ribs are open, your lips begin to flutter when you hold a note for long, your throat isn't tensed, high notes resonate somewhere around your cheekbones). It's so goddamn tempting to listen though, but it just doesn't work! You sound awful in your head when singing high notes, all annoying and thin and \"mosquito-like\" - as my teacher says - but that's actually a sign you're doing it right. Conversely, you might think you're doing great and that everything is deep and ringing, but then you actually hear yourself in a recording and reality isn't always so kind. This invisibility is what makes it harder to overcome mental barriers, which I've covered in the point below. Psychology dominating the game Singing is 100% more affected by psychology than any other instrument is. You can hire someone to tune your piano and regardless of your mood, your stress or anxiety, your fear of being heard, your low confidence, or your natural physiological habits regarding breathing, speaking (e.g. talking through your nose), or posture, that note will always sound. The A will always be A, the C will always be C, and that\u2019s pretty much it. All you have to do is press the key or pluck the string. The rest of the work is just you developing agility and musicality through constant practice. Singing is not like that. Worried about being heard? You will subconsciously try to minimize the sound, and so you might either sound nasal (when sound goes through your nose it projects less) or breathy and thin. Nervous? Sometimes even professional singers get pitchy and sharp when they\u2019re anxious, let alone an amateur. Not confident in your ability? You will squeeze, clench, and scrunch - your body and your throat will naturally try to help you reach those notes in ways that only make your problem worse as you get tighter and tighter, and this robs you of even more confidence and can set off a destructive spiral. To sing you have to relax, but how do you relax when you think you suck, and when relaxing doesn\u2019t seem to solve the problem? A lack of confidence also means that you cannot pump in the energy needed to create a strong sound, even if you\u2019re doing everything \u2018right\u2019. This brings us to our next point. One hell of balancing act To sing, you must: Maintain firmness in your stomach without squeezing / preventing too much air from escaping too quickly without being rigid in the processRelax but don't relax too much and get breathyAllow for nasal \u2018resonance\u2019 without being nasalDrop your jaw but don't widen your mouth as this would make the sound become 'spread' (unfocused / thin)These are just a few I could think of right off the top of my head. There's a lot to prepare before you open your mouth to sing and a lot to do when it's actually open besides following the pitch (which can be hard enough sometimes if you're like me and had to develop a musical ear instead of being born with it). And you're supposed to balance like this without getting the slightest bit tense! You have to feel Emotion is so important! You can be suicidal and still play the flute or any other instrument relatively convincingly, but your mood and expression do not only influence the sound quality of singing (as I mentioned above), they also affect how 'good' it sounds. Just lacking confidence can make you sound boring and monotone, and even if there's nothing \"technically\" wrong with your performance, it might not make you a good singer because it lacks heart, and since we're talking about a human voice this lack is so much more noticeable to the average listener that it would be on any other instrument. That's partly why singing is difficult, but also why it promises such a huge reward; there is no form of musical expression quite like it. This, however, can also be a problem in itself. Singing is taken personally (And people are ignorant assholes) When someone doesn't like your voice, it can feel like someone not liking you. The voice is naturally something personal and unique to you; it\u2019s as much a part of your identity as your face is, and insulting it can really hurt\u2026 which is why people find insulting bad singers so satisfying! Just look at all these voice shows and see how eager people are to tear apart a poor singer and compare them to anything from a \"dying cat\" (a common one) to a banshee. If you sucked at guitar, nasty people will still be nasty, but it doesn\u2019t get as ugly and it\u2019s not seen a blow to the instrument - it's just that you don't know how to master it. When you don't sing well, people blame both your voice and your mastery, and this can destroy your confidence! What's the point of trying to play a guitar well if it was broken from the moment you got it and can't be fixed or replaced? You might stop trying right? Yeah, well, that's what you would want to do with singing if you believed the misguided people who think that it's your voice and not your mastery of it that makes you sound bad. Your voice is fine - it's just out of tune or you're not sure how to use it yet, and this can be fixed! ANYONE can learn how to strengthen their musical ear even if they were once tone-deaf; it's a skill you can learn even if you weren't born with it, so is projection and all these other things. It might take years and be a lot more frustrating and even embarrassing to try to and develop these skills someone else might have been, for the most part, born with, but it can be done. What's funny is that one day after years of bleeding and screeching in attics where you hoped nobody could hear you, you might hear someone say you're talented and have a good 'voice' - without giving credit to all the hard work you put into it! There's obviously natural tone and inflection, but no voice is naturally more pleasing than another any more than any instrument is - it all depends on taste. My mother hates violins, I love them. Most people put opera singer Maria Callas - one of the most famous sopranos of all time - on a pedestal, but her stuffy-nosed metallic tone makes me wince. So it really boils down to mastery, and it's nothing personal, but it's so hard to believe that with all the misinformation and assholery out there. Finding a good voice teacher is hard\u2026 and the wrong one can damage your voice This one speaks for itself, especially considering the unique role of psychology in singing which means you need someone intelligent and empathetic who also knows how to really help you master the invisible. And the warning is important. If you have a bad guitar teacher, that's not going to do much more than waste your money, but having a bad voice teacher who encourages poor technique might lead to you developing vocal nodules. If you think about how hard it is, it WILL be hard This is less about singing and more about anything you might want to do: if you focus on the setbacks and the struggles, they will grow in your mind. Keep telling yourself it's easy, it's worth it, and keep trying. What I always believed was that if you can give up on something you really care about (for me this was singing) then you can give up on anything, even living. So don't give up! _____ P.S. My credential is \u2018I've been taking singing lessons for four years\u2019. I tried to add that by my name but Quora can be a fucking pain in the ass. Should I say I have a degree in singing? I\u2019ve certainly been at it long enough to have one by now! ",

            "answer_text": "Reading the first part of your question, my thoughts were that you are too tense and may need to learn to relax the muscles in your throat and shoulders becuase that is the main cause of pain. Other responders may be right in that you are an alto or baritone and should not try to hit high notes. Sing in the range that is comfortable for you. Then, if that doesn\u2019t hurt your throat, you can gradually sing a couple of notes higher and higher. Cracking could also be from tension. Singing should be fun for you. If it isn\u2019t, then you need to find out why. One method I\u2019ve used is to push against a wall to vocalize scales. That relaxes my muscles in my throat and transfers it to my body. Plus, it will help stabilize your voice. Are you using basic singing techniques like breathing with your diaphragm? My first singing lesson was putting my hand on my diaphragm and working to make my hand go out and in, and not my chest. Then my teacher had me take a breath and blow it out slowly and evenly. Try to get longer and longer. Panting like a dog will exercise those diaphragm muscles. Hit a note in the middle of your range and hold it as long as you can. Tightening the diaphragm area will give your voice support and will sound fuller and louder. Humming is a good way to sustain a note and its easier than making a full sound. Try humming \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d or the like. Be sure your larynx is vibrating by gently touching the front of your neck. If these methods don\u2019t help with sustaining a note, my next advise would be to see an otolaryngologist ( ear, nose and throat doctor) to see if there is a physical problem. You could also have some respiratory issues (asthma, for example) that interferes with your breath control. I don\u2019t want to scare you, but the first thing I noticed when I began having heart issues was that I couldn\u2019t sustain a note or even read aloud without having breathing problems. However, that was after singing for a lifetime and it began very suddenly. If not sustaining a note is new, see a respiratory or cardiac physician. If you have always had problems holding a note ,that sounds much more like a tension issue. A lot of people don\u2019t like the way they sound on a recorder, for many different reasons. A microphone may not be good enough to pick up all of the nuances of your voice, or a speaker may distort the sound. You can\u2019t really go by what you hear because your voice is resonating through your bones, teeth, etc. and you may not sound exactly like you think. It takes getting used to hearing your own voice recorded. Do you have any friends who could tell you honestly what they think about how you sound vs the way the recording sounds? To sing well, you have to both hear and feel that the tones are being done correctly. As the others have said, go to a voice teacher for an evaluation lesson to see what they recommend. It\u2019s difficult to know what you need to do differently on the internet. I hope this has helped. ",
