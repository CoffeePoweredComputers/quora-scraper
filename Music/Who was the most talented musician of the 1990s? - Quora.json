Jokes aside, the question is about such a wide spectrum of music styles, feelings conveyed and music proficiency that one name would not be enough. I mean, Michael Jackson was still alive and kicking asses (though turning more and more paranoic) and believe me, he could and actually would go to his producers with every single piece of music score in his mind to tell them instrument by instrument what his songs would be like; or perhaps, you are more into the intricate, impossible-to-keep-up-with metal symphonies Dream Theater would come up with; and\u2026what about the absurd talent Michel Petrucciani used to showcase during each and every concert of his with his piano? My suggestion: make up your mind and\u2026then enjoy as much music as you can, putting talent classification aside! ",
