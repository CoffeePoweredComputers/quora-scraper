            "answer_text": "Because the bickering is important! The candidates' personal interactions are just as insightful as their political substance. If a candidate is too assertive, the audience might consider him or her overly aggressive. If a candidate is too quiet, he or she might be thought of as overly submissive. It is critical that a voting public be exposed to these rhetorical characteristics of candidates. Being able to negotiate a tense conversation and communicate convincingly among dissimilar peers are essential traits for any president to have. What you want are two candidates who don't bicker, not two candidates whose tendencies to bicker are hidden from public knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "A more cynical (realistic?) version of Tyler's answer. The entire thing is a big stage show.  Bands come on for encores and even plays don't fully end when the curtain goes down. The politically committed get to root for their team a little longer and become more entrenched. The undecided can be further swayed by charisma and non-verbal behaviors.  Fine characteristics to unwittingly select a president on btw. Most everyone loses in some way except the network who always wins the longer you tune in. Which brings us back to your why question. ",
