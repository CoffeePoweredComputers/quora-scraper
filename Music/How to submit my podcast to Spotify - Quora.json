I know the free host Anchor - The easiest way to make a podcast does, and Libsyn does as well. I\u2019ll include a full list below. One of the requirements to get your podcast on Spotify is to have 2 months worth of shows published. Spotify can be a tough nut to crack. If you are hosted with one of the following audio hosts, you can get on Spotify through your host: \u25cf Audioboom \u25cf Blubbry \u25cf Buzzsprout \u25cf Fireside \u25cf LibSyn \u25cf Pippa \u25cf PodBean \u25cf Podigee \u25cf Podomatic \u25cf Simplecast \u25cf Spreaker If you\u2019re not hosted with one of these platforms, try this form - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKJ76t_tPV2jugdX14NeajSfp7EV0hcgjVki1GEGuoeyJvDw/viewform?c=0&w=1 Spotify doesn\u2019t guarantee acceptance. Good luck. I got this information from a PDF report that tells you how to get your podcast on all the major platforms as well as a few minor ones. There\u2019s like more than 25 included with screenshots and detailed instructions. Here\u2019s the report - Podcast Everywhere ",

            "answer_text": "Spotify: It\u2019s possible, but you have to be patient - and it\u2019s not guaranteed Before we get too far into this, you need to know there\u2019s a catch. OK, it\u2019s not quite a catch, it\u2019s more of a caveat. Unlike the other directories or services, the powers-that-be at Spotify make it clear right up front that you can submit your show to them, but that your submission doesn\u2019t guarantee that your show will indeed be chosen for inclusion in Spotify. So there\u2019s that. But I think it\u2019s worth a try anyway. Here\u2019s how to do it. Go to this weblink: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKJ76t_tPV2jugdX14NeajSfp7EV0hcgjVki1GEGuoeyJvDw/viewform It\u2019s a Google form. Interesting, I don\u2019t recall another submission process being done with a Google form. And you\u2019ll notice right away that Spotify is making it clear that your submission may or may not be included in their directory of shows. The cool thing about this submission process is that you can submit more than one podcast at the same time. So rather than go through every form I\u2019m just going to tell you that it\u2019s fairly simple to do and it\u2019s definitely worth your time. Should the Spotify authorities deem your podcast worthy enough for inclusion, your show would be exposed to all kinds of potential new listeners. This is one small part of an episode I published about ALL the places to submit your podcast: Podcastification -podcasting tips, podcast tricks, and how to podcast better: The 2017-2018 List of Podcast Directories Your Podcast MUST Be Listed In [Ep 79] ",
