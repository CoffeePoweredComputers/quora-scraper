            "answer_text": "Because someone else is singing with you. (As in, the artist in the song). Even if you forget the lyrics for a quarter of a second, the beginning consonant of the singer can immediately jog your memory so it \u201cseems\u201d as though you never forgot the lyrics. Try this - find any karaoke version of a song you like. The instruments and background music are there, but the lead singer is stripped from the song. I can almost guarantee that you'll miss some of the lyrics. Now, play the original song. You'll do much better.  However\u2026. I still can't deny that there is truth to the question. Even still, our minds process memory so much easier when a song is being played than when trying to think of the song on our own. I suppose I would have to study psychology in order to completely understand the depth of this question. ",

            "answer_text": "It's mostly when you remember the rythm of the song that you can remember the lyrics but when you are not sure about the rythm, you start having problems remembering the lyrics. When you are listening to the song, the rythm come to you and the lyrics also fall in the right places. One other thing is, you aren't actually remembering the lyrics during the song. There's always a lag between the time the artist say the word and the time you say yours. You actually hear what he said and say the same thing but you won't know since sound travels so fast you think you are in sync with the song. ",
