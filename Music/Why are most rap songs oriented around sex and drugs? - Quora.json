            "answer_text": "I AM gonna tell you most rap music isn't oriented around sex and drugs. Most is a majority and that would be like over 50% of all rap music IN THE WORLD. A false generalization. And if you really think it is, then you can say the same for pop music, too. And R&B. Rap covers way more topics than just sex and drugs so the word \u201cmost\u201d isn't a good word. Some is better. So, why are some rap songs oriented around sex and drugs? Because the artist wants to rap about sex and/or drugs. It's their way of music and what they want to put on a track. ",
