            "answer_text": "Ok I AM a white woman, and in my opinion it is not racist but it is cultural appropriation (appropriation can go both ways, not just one) or can be seen as mocking the black race even if its unintentional. But the same can be said if a black woman were to straighten her hair or have a long straight blonde weave -which many black women wear their hair like that, however they dont see it as being \u201cracist\u201d or \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d if they wear their hair in a long straight blonde weave/wig or straighten their hair. So its kind of a double standard, meaning its ok for black women to wear their hair like ours but we can't do the same without being called out. But me personally if I were to see a white woman with an afro, I would think she is trying to be black and I also think the same thing when I see the reverse happen (a black woman wearing a long straight blonde wig or weave) or if her hair is straightened that she's trying to be white, but then again we are all free to style our hair how we want it. But regardless, appropriation goes both ways and anyone can be guilty of cultural appropriation no matter what color they are. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems this is the third time I am being asked a very similar question. I would first like to note that an Afro is not a natural state for wooly hair. Poofing the hair symmetrically requires not only styling but constant maintenance by combing the hair up and away from the scalp. Many \u201cBlack\u201d people are only able to achieve the effect through inducing extreme heat to the hair shaft, permanently damaging it or a blow out. I am not against the Afro, as long as not \u201cblown out\u201d. The Afro as a style is ancient, as Kemetian/Egyptian rulers wore the style. In the US it has come to be associated with a non-\u201dWhite\u201d aesthetic. Here is the problem. Is the individual celebrating a culture different from their own, or making a parody? I attended a private school in Chicago with 100% \u201cBlack\u201d population. My track coach, let's say Mr. Smith, was Irish from New York. He had a very gravelly voice and thick NY accent. Busta Rhymes Fat Joe NY, not Bernie Sanders NY. At the time, 1988, he had a Care Free Curl, he utilized activator, moisturizer and had a \u201ccurl bag\u201d. In yearbook photos from 1970s he had a nice size Afro. Now I heard a student ask him why--He dead face serious and insulted said \u201cWhat a \u201cWhite\u201d man can't look good? Some of us do have style?\u201d. Now please keep in mind, whatever the hot style was for \u201cBlack\u201d people in the 1970s-1990, Mr. Smith was wearing it. He properly code switched, at appropriate times. He really was \u201cBlack\u201d in all things except skin tone. I uncovered eventually that he grew up as part of the only \u201cWhite\u201d family in a NY neighborhood that transitioned from Irish to \u201cBlack\u201d. As such, Mr. Smith grew up subsumed by the \u201cBlack\u201d aesthetic. So the Afro/Jheri Curl were natural to him. Yet extremely odd to everyone else. This is 100% true story, except for the name. My point is that Mr. Smith celebrated the aesthetic. He also talked about minstrelsy, which should have seemed odd; his extremely cold anger made it extraordinarily natural. ",
