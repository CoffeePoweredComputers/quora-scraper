Anthony Kiedis grew up with a materialistic philosophy\u2026if you don\u2019t get it for yourself, nobody will give it to you. One day, he was rummaging through his then-girlfriend\u2019s (Nina Hagen) closet, and found a jacket that he liked. She told him to keep it. He was blown away that anyone would give him something like this, and she told him that giving it away made her happier than keeping it. It completely changed his outlook on life, and he began to look at things differently. So, give it away. ",
