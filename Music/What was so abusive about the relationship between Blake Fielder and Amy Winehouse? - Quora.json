            "answer_text": "Blake Fielder-Civil introduced Amy to hard drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine. He introduced her to self-harm. They indulged in other drugs as well such as ecstacy and valium. They both had a drinking problem. The drugs/booze served as a catalyst for a lot of the abuse in their already codependent relationship. Blake appears to be a bad influence on young Amy who craved a lasting loving relationship. She seemed head over heels for Blake from the start. Which made her easy for him to influence. He is heard encouraging her to sing a racist jingle while recording her. He recorded lots of private videos of the pair surrounded by drug paraphernalia a long with a lot of still shots. There had been reportings of public altercations that included domestic abuse. At a hotel the couple is heard arguing and throwing things about. No one is entirely sure what went down in the hotel room but Amy was bloodied and bruised as well as Blake. Blake was in worse condition than Amy. Amy claimed that Blake did not inflict her wounds but that she had harmed herself. I think the drug rampant party life style of the pair had a lot to do with the troubles in their relationship. Maybe some underlying mental health issues as well. Here is an article that talks about the relationship between the two. Inside Amy Winehouse's dark and destructive relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil. ",
