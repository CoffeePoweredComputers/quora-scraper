            "answer_text": "Napoleon Bonaparte is perhaps one of the most interesting people to have walked the earth. Napoleon is so interesting for his incredibly unique personality, talent, and deeds. In fact; the famous Romantic poet Lord Byron described Napoleon as the ideal romantic hero; the flawed, lonely, and persecuted genius. 1.) Personality. Napoleon was 24/7 surrounded by his associates (marshals, diplomats, advisors, scientists, etc.), and was constantly interacting with them. Napoleon has been described as being able to be caring and friendly one moment, then he could snap in an instant, becoming cold and rash. It is these erratic personas that make Napoleon\u2019s personality unique. He and Empress Josephine had an unstable relationship of adultery, but they still loved each other. Napoleon and his Marshals were best friends, and when the Emperor\u2019s best friend; Jean Lannes died on the battlefield of Essling in 1809, Napoleon cried. He kept a brotherhood like bond with his men even in the bloodiest campaigns, and even in the disastrous Russian campaign of 1812, Napoleon still held a certain humor and compassion. Most of all, Napoleon had unquenchable ambition and work ethic, going from a bullied foreigner to Emperor of the French in a few years. 2.) Talent. Napoleon is considered one of, if not, the best military commander of all time. He revolutionized warfare into what we know of it today. He avoided sieges as they were long, costly, and ineffective, he taught his soldiers to live off the land instead of relying on thin and expensive supply lines, created strong organizational foundations such like the corp, and most of all he believed in the highest morale possible for his soldiers, regularly promoting soldiers and regimental pride. After these important reforms, Napoleon was able to focus on strategy and tactics. He employed deception to provoke his enemies to attack in fall into a trap. Napoleon always made his army appear weak; burning down camps, retreating, sending diplomats to rival armies, all of which would convince the enemy to make an overconfident attack, only to fall into a trap by the elite Grande Armee. Thanks to his military skill, Napoleon was able to win extremely decisive battles of Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, and Friedland. Even when all odds were against him in terms of numbers in the Sixth Coalition, Napoleon pulled off stunning victories at Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, and the Six Days Campaign, which many consider his best victories. 3.) Deeds. In addition to his military achievements, Napoleon made lasting political changes and foundations, most notably the Napoleonic Code, which abolished feudalism, separated church and state, and promoted meritocracy. The Napoleonic Code was so effective it is still in use by many states today. In addition to the Napoleonic Code you can thank Napoleon for driving on the right, the metric system, canned foods, modern Paris, and the United States we know today (no Louisiana Purchase; no Manifest Destiny; no US). Without Napoleon, the world would be unrecognizably different. ",

            "answer_text": "We all know that Napoleon was one of the greatest military commanders in history. We have also read about his military genius, rise to power, reforms, military campaigns and fall from glory during our school. Sure the textbook stuff was interesting, but today we unveil some other lesser known facts about the power-hungry conqueror. Here are some interesting facts about Napoleon Bonaparte which you may not be aware of:  1. Napoleon wasn\u2019t French!  It\u2019s true! Napoleon\u2019s family was more Italian than French. He was born on the Island of Corsica, which wasn\u2019t 100% French as the island just had a year of being in French power, and they had a different accent. At age 9, Napoleon, nicknamed Nabulio, attended school in France, where he learned to speak French fluently but never lost his Corsican accent. He was reportedly mocked for it by his classmates. 2. The Little Corporal was tall enough!  Early in his military career, Napoleon was nicknamed \u201cThe Little Corporal\u201d for his allegedly short stature. However, he had an average height during those times, about 1.70 m. The confusion regarding his height was due to the fact that the height recorded at the time of his death was 5 ft 2 in French units which translate to 5 foot 6 in present times. Another reason was he liked to keep extremely tall soldiers around him which made him appear shorter. 3. Bravery isn\u2019t the absence of fear!  Napoleon, the greatest military commanders in history, is known to have \u201cAilurophobia,\u201d meaning he was afraid of cats. He was also terrified of open doors. Anybody entering his room had to squeeze through a barely adequate opening and then shut the door immediately. It was said that Napoleon could create an effective \u201cQueen of Hearts\u201d impression \u2013 off with your head! if someone let the door open. 4. First-night tragedy!  Josephine It was a rather funny incident when Napoleon was bitten by his wife\u2019s dog at their first night. The couple became so passionate that Josephine\u2019s dog thought she was under attack and came to her rescue. Poor Napoleon! 5. Played chess with a machine!  The secret interior of the Turk Napoleon was not one to be upstaged but was famously beaten in chess by the Turk, a fake chess-playing machine. What Napoleon wasn\u2019t aware of was that the Turk had a person hiding in its interiors. 6. Napoleon cheated at cards  Napoleon hated to lose and took pains to avoid it. Though his skills of perception and prompt judgment helped him master everything which came in his way, he was, surprisingly not a pro at any game and as he hated being lost, his only resource was to cheat. 7. Napoleon incognito! Napoleon really enjoyed disguising himself as bourgeois and dressing up in poor clothes to walk Paris, asking questions to people. This way, he would know how people felt about him and his policies, and how popular he really was. He must have enjoyed a lot doing that.

            "answer_text": "Napoleon is a very interesting example of the use and misuse of power.I think his best achievements are in the way he reorganized France after the disaster we know as the French Revolution. His reorganization of civil law and his support for religious minorities and his pride in things French can be placed on the plus side. But on the debit side he was a megalomaniac and a War Lord. As such he was murderer on a massive scale. Most of time he was a very good general up against moderate opposition. However, when he met another very good general in Wellington, he was soundly beaten. Also on the debit side he betrayed his troops on at least 3 occasions 1) He deserted his defeated army in Egypt and incidentally portrayed this as a victory 2) He abandoned his troops after his very foolish attack on Russia. It cannot be a surprise to anyone that this not going to end up well. Except perhaps for another melomaniac in Hitler. 3) When it was clear that he was going to lose, he abandoned his troops (yet again) at Waterloo.These are some things he did on a large European scale that have made him famous. In my view he was and is famous because he was an influential man but he was not a great man. Great men do not set about starting wars and killingpeople in the hundreds of thousands. ",

            "answer_text": "Not a lot since his opposition did their best to stamp his legacy out, but Napoleon's rule brought up a new form of French prestige and national pride. France was always a great power of Europe, but power was always credited to the monarch. The kings did it, not the people. Napoleon was the emperor of the people. He was chosen by the people. Revolutionary France, before and after Napoleon's coronation, proved that it was still a force to be reckoned with. Napoleon, in particular, being the face of the revolution, spreading national and liberal fervor across Europe on his exploits. The Napoleonic Code, of course, set a standard for modern European law, such as his system to reward based on merit rather than noble birth. He inspired many revolutionaries such as Simon Bolivar. Most people today, I'd say, when they think about the French Revolution, Napoleon definitely comes to mind. His legacy elsewhere is mixed. Polish people seem to be fond of his as he was the only one at the time interested in forming an independant Polish state. His military legacy is legendary. Any military historian would study Napoleon's tactics alongside the likes of Hannibal Barca, Julius Caesar, and Frederick the Great. His Egyptian campaign contributed much to our understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization through the discovery of the Rosetta Stone. On another note, the legacy brought upon by his defeat saw the rise of Britain as a global power and the inevitable rise of Prussia to the German Empire later on. ",

            "answer_text": "Napoleon Bonaparte is most recognized for being the short leader of France, despite him being relatively tall for someone of his time.  After coming into power after the French revolution, he played a big part in the upcoming of the rather brief (in my opinion, at least compared to that of Britain) French Empire. I am not an expert on the manner (So I can\u2019t explain all the battles and things that took place), but he started -and won most of-  the Napoleonic Wars, which led the allies to exile him to the island of Elba, where he was treated like a king by all whom lived there. Later on, he tried to come back and take power in France by launching an invasion, but at the Battle of Waterloo he lost greatly and he was exiled again to a far more remote island in the South Atlantic, Saint Helena. He died there at the age of 51, and Europe was upset over such a thing. They brought his remains back to Paris, where they are said to reside at Les Invalides. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 One thing I do find rather funny is that he tried to invade Moscow to take over Russia, and as he made his way through the country -in winter, may I add- people burned their villages down so the French couldn\u2019t take their resources to eat, or use their homes, etc. By the time they got to the capital, they had burned that down too so they retreated hungry and defeated. It\u2019s very ironic, and it\u2019s amusing to think they went through all that, and that the Russians went as far as to burn their own homes and resources. Then again, it\u2019s Russia, and with that much land they\u2019d have plenty of resources to rebuild and such. ",

He was arguably the best general in history, winning more victories than Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great combined. Napoleon held supreme power for well over a decade. Europe and the world were changed forever on account of his reforms, mistakes, battles, victories, changes and crimes. His exile to St. Helena made him all the more memorable.  ",

Some people in power are very threatened by his example so they twist his story - making him only more famous. Some people like me are tired of all the lies so we talk about him - which makes him more famous. Napoleon was a fascinating study in contradictions and a real life paladin.

He rationalized that hitting the enemy in the middle then running troops through the middle and having them spread out and hit a split enemy on the flanks seemed to work. He tried this tactic a few times before his enemy would catch on to his way of success. Wellington learned of Napoleon\u2019s fighting and devised a way of concealing his numbers. Napoleon\u2019s men found it hard to deal with Blucker\u2019s (I know spell check) men and wellington\u2019s men in great numbers on both flanks. If retreat was a good enough option but Napoleon\u2019s men were sucked in too far and discovered Wellington\u2019s hidden men too late to recover. Sounds like a good movie. ",

Also as ruler he did many things; unlike Hitler some very positive. The Code Napoleon remains the basis for much continental European law today. He forced much of Europe by force into the modern world and his ruling elite was formed largely by merit not birth. Old Europe never recovered from the reality that this simply made things work better. ",

I eagerly look forward to challenges to the above views, and equally to statements of additional ramifications of Napoleon's career. ",
