            "answer_text": "I would like to think the same thing. First of all, he is a money-making machine, so he'll say anything that people want to hear, and stories of the underdog  have been popular since time immemorial. Additionally, I too remember seeing him on Degrassi when he was fairly young, before his rap career, so he obviously didn't start rapping from the bottom.  However from a quick glance at his wiki page, Drake (entertainer), it sounds as though he had some tough conditions early on in life. One quote, regarding his mother's move to a new neighborhood, illuminates this:  \"She wanted the best for her family. She found us a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.\" So, if what he says is true, it sounds as though he did literally start from the bottom. It's hard to judge whether celebrities, especially rappers like Drake, are ever telling the truth, but in situations like this you might as well give them the benefit of the doubt. Either way. the beat for that song is nice as hell though, so I don't really care what he says. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The scenario he describes true or not may be the bottom by his metrics But certainly is not the bottom by realistic measures and comparisons. Like he says in \"Party Next Door\" Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither /We all lost mad people, the city wild. He's right is not Compton or Queens Bridge where you can get done in for nothing or anything. Or what about places where basements under mommy's apartment are luxury in a dream, like parts of Africa or Haiti. At best (or I guess worst?) He came from lower middle class. Even in his bio on his official page there is not a single message of hardship, I can say from experience the \"bottom\" helps make a man who they are and definitely would be slightly noteworthy. ",

Yes, the house he lived in was a rental but by no means was he in a bad place. Now, he did stay in that house's basement, so yeah, if you look at that, he did start from the bottom, haha.  I am a Drake fan, I see him at Raptors games, he is a cool guy and makes good music. I don't judge him beyond his music, because what does it matter to us where he started from? ",
