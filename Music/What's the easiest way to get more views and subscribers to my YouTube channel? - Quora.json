            "answer_text": "There is no easy way, there\u2019s no sweet shortcut, success isn\u2019t going to come overnight. At the start you have to work hard and make some sacrifices. I'm by no means an \"expert\" on youtube, but I do have a YouTube channel with over 250k subscribers. I'm only sharing what I've learned so far, and maybe you can get some value from it. Networking is 50% of successBe a constructive member of your community! It seems like the majority of people doesn\u2019t know or just they don\u2019t want to know what that means. It doesn\u2019t mean to annoy people and spam your channel link on people\u2019s videos, messages. It doesn\u2019t mean sub4sub. It doesn\u2019t mean promoting your videos in inappropriate places. Member of the community means TALKING TO PEOPLE! Now go at YouTube browse random SMALL channels, find them in the comment sections of other videos, or in featured channels of other channels. Watch one or several of their videos, watch the whole video, and then leave a POSITIVE comment, write something you liked about it, or suggest improvement if you think it\u2019ll help.Then move to another video, to another channel and repeat. The channel owner WILL respond back because everyone at that stage loves comments, actually it is in human nature we like to be NOTICED. ConsistencyThis one is obvious. People won't subscribe to a one time wonder. They want consistency. Stick with it no matter what. As long as you have other people who want to watch your stuff, even if it's like 2 people, keep making stuff. Interacting with your viewersReply back to every comment on your videos because it builds a community that keeps viewers coming back for more and entices new viewers to become subscribers. This used to be standard advice for blogs, and for some reason, people don't follow it on youtube. If someone takes time out of their day to comment on your tiny youtube channel, you owe it to them to at least thank them. Humans are visual creaturesI have heard people on the Internet suggest that as far as your channel is great, your branding doesn\u2019t matter. This is wrong and dangerous. We are attracted to aesthetically pleasing views and we will always favor something beautiful to something ugly. Now take a look at your channel art and profile icon - can you improve them? Same goes for thumbnails of every new video - check them twice before posting. Timing uploadsThis really works. Upload when the majority of your subscribers are online. I learned that by uploading at peak hours (Fri and Saturday mid to late mornings) I was able to instantly increase my viewership. It's easy to do this with the \"schedule\" feature when you upload on YouTube. I didn't know about this until a couple weeks ago, but I'm sure this is probably common knowledge for most of you. Focus On Quality TrafficYou must know who is your target audience. Quality Traffic comprises of people you want to target who watch complete or most of your video. They find your content purposeful and engaging. These are the people who are likely to share and like your videos. You will get subscribers only by driving quality traffic to your channel. Personal benefitI used to not be able to speak for 10 seconds uninterrupted on camera without getting shy and starting to stutter. Now, I feel more confident on camera and in my day to day life. If there's a single way to force yourself to become a better, more confident speaker- it's through making videos. This is HUGE. Above all, YouTube is a second largest social media network and second largest search engine in the world. Go there interact with other people like on any other social platform and make sure you have optimized your videos for search engines.

            "answer_text": "Hello Well, growing YouTube is not easy as it requires time and hardworking. I think the easiest way to do this is to love what you do. As you enjoy working on your channel, developing it, eventually you\u2019ll notice that you gained more subscribers and more views. So, here are some strategies, that will help to promote your videos and thus get more views. You certainly should start with SEO. Titles are #1 SEO tool. Add correct keywords to your titles and it\u2019ll be easier for people to find your video.#2 SEO tool for YouTube is the correct description. You don't have to write a long and boring description of your video. Make it short, informative and catchy. But when doing this don\u2019t forget to add keywords and URLs in the description box.#3 SEO crucial technique is a relevant tag. Pay attention to your tags. Again add keywords and words related to your video\u2019s content.Next important point, in my opinion, is making high-quality videos. Get a nice camera to be able to shoot high-quality videos. The quality you provide is of huge importance. if your content doesn\u2019t look professional, every viewer simply won\u2019t take you seriously, and this is especially crucial if you\u2019re launching the channel for business purposes. Also, take your time to edit your videos. Editing is important and it\u2019s not just about cutting and adding scenes.Video thumbnails are just anther important point. YouTube will always scan any video you upload in order to develop three unique frames that can be used as thumbnails. But it would be better if you create your own thumbnail and upload it rather than leaving it to YouTube to do it for you. Thumbnails do matter, as some people might not even click on your video as your thumbnail does not match to your titles or else your thumbnail is something absolutely irrelevant.Concentrate more on the beginning of your video. Making an impression within the first few seconds of your video is essential because most people would stop the video after first few seconds. You might as well start with a nice intro that will be inspiring and catchy. A short video intro is almost a necessity YouTube videos and it does not require more than a few seconds. Make sure the intro is on point and not one those that plays a musical track for about 90 seconds. If it is too long most people will lose interest and skip it or even close your video altogether.And finally, don\u2019t forget to share your video on other websites. Social media can be really helpful at this point. Just use relevant tags, write something inspiring and you\u2019re good to go. Each time you produce new videos endeavor to share it on other social networks. Because Twitter conversation moves quicker than other social networks, you can get away with promoting your video a couple times. Facebook, on the other hand, can see success from a single post.Enjoy what you do and the work will be way easier. ",
