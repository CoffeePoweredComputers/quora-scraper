            "answer_text": "I do not think \u201cmost Beatles fans\u201d dislike it, but a large percentage of the younger fans may feel awkward listening to it as it is an imaginary fantasy song(a classic, the first of its kind, which most people do not know!) that they feel is more designed for the young children, than the fan base to which they belong\u2026 It is interesting that the older generation that grew up during that time, the baby boomers included, like that song far more than the younger generation growing up today. It is a reflection of the division of cultural and psychosocial tendencies favoring more mature themes by any group of singers, over the decades that has taken over in more recent decades. It was the first of its kind, a children\u2019s fantasy world theme, a wonderfully innocent theme that was immortalized by \u201cthe four horsemen of our apocalypse\u201d to quote Leonard Bernstein. It was an original breakthrough in many ways, in the allocation of childlike fantasy to the song\u2019s lyrics, the great group performance as an unit of great charm, the delightful music, the real life sound effects, the overall blithe, and the beautiful \u2018physics and the chemistry\u2019 of the human imagination\u2026 It's like-ability difference over the decades is more indicative of change in cultural consciousness and psycho-social attitudes of people evolving in a conundrum of social changes, than anything to do with song itself !! In fact changes in society and peoples\u2019 perceptions of musical content can be studied with respect to changing like-ability of an established song, as for the Beatles\u2019 yellow submarine. The Beatles were an universally probing musical entity of genius, and they did not leave any stones unturned in their great artistic thoughts, musicality and expressions\u2026 The song is intrinsically great and,\u2018The song remains the same\u2019\u2026 Kaiser T, MD.

            "answer_text": "I can't quite understand why \"Yellow Submarine\" is so disliked by people who call themselves Beatle fans but I guess I feel pretty strongly against \"Come Together\" so to each his own. I think YS is a lively and creative and whimsical children's song, written mostly by Paul for Ringo's limited vocal range. It turned out to be one of Ringo's strongest vocal contributions (I think it's his best) and when it was first released as a Double A-side single with REVOLVER as an album, it provided a nice thematic contrast to Eleanor Rigby. It was considered a great novelty song at the time it was released. I think it grew in dis-favor when it was released eighteen months later as part of the half-album YS movie soundtrack. The animated feature film of the same name received high acclaim but the soundtrack album had only one side of Beatle compositions with the other side being George Martin movie theme accompaniment, much like the U.S.A. soundtrack of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT issued byUnited Artists doing their best Capitol Records imitation. The YS soundtrack should never have been released as an \"official\" Beatles album. The four original songs were basically discards from previous album sessions and they were not their best efforts.
