You just got off from work, and don\u2019t want to cook yet are in dire need of a Bami Rames Speciaal, before Thuisbezorgd, you needed to: Go to your favourite take-away restaurant (5 - 15 minutes)Find a place to park your car (5 - 10 minutes)Order your food and wait for it to be packaged and ready (10 - 20 minutes)Walk back to your car and drive home (5 - 15 minutes)In that time, you could\u2019ve made that plate of Bami Rames Speciaal in your own kitchen.

            "answer_text": "Mostly just the monopoly and the first mover advantage they have. They dont really offer good deals to restaurants. But almost everyone in NL knows thuisbezorgd for food delivery. They are in the smallest of towns to the biggest cities. The user experience is terrible and there is no customer service, ive seen food delivery apps in India and US are light years ahead of thuisbezorgd. If a big player with deep pockets were to offer a better UX and customer service, they could eat into the thuisbezorgd market share, until they either would have to match the better experience for customers or compete on lower revenue share. Deliveroo, Foodora and Uber Eats are all trying to be that, but unfortunately their UX also sucks, and arent enough to really move loyal customers who are used to thuisbezorgd by now to migrate to these apps.

            "answer_text": "It means just 'home delivery'. As any place in the world. Go to India. It is a big business, nowadays. People make a living just doing 'home delivery' in two wheeler, not even cars. That too Indian type of home-made food. But the drivers have to face deep challenges as many times through Monsoon season one has to deliver.  The video is in Hindi. But one can understand the challenges from the visuals. So, I guess it is all over the world. All the very best! Regards, Swaroopa. ",
