That was the most spectacular performance I had ever seen on a live stage. They were dancing and singing at the same time and I noticed that they weren\u2019t even lip syncing!!!! I was instantly drawn to them and started trying to know more about them. Even if their songs didn\u2019t suit my style of music initially, I ended up loving and adoring the songs sooo much that I am a crazy BTS fan now\u2026 xD ",

I got curious, and eventually, I ended up watching Blood, Sweat and Tears. It was a total coincidence, but it really clicked with me. Next came their other mainstreams videos: Fake Love, Not Today, Dope, etc. Even though I already liked BTS\u2019s music at the very beginning\u2014 with MIC Drop\u2014 I think the final blow, le coup de foudre was Baepsae. That\u2019s when I wanted to know all about them. ",
