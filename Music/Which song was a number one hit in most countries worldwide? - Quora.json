            "answer_text": "I would guess Volare or Nel blu depinto di blu by Domenico Modugno. This song was the bane of our existence when we were teenagers. I was from Staten Island and a local group called The Elegants had a big hit with a song called \u201cLittle Star\u201d. Every week we would check the listings and Volare was always number one with Little Star number two. After a couple months they both went down the charts together so Little Star never made it to number one. ",
