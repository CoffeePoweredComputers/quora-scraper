            "answer_text": "What keyboard synthesizer has all sounds from Moog, ARP, CS-80, Prophet-5, OBX-a and Jupiter-6? This is a fun question, as these synths are analog classics. As an owner of classic Moog, Oberheim, and Roland synths, I can assure you that no single hardware synthesizer will effectively emulate the exact sounds of all these synths. You can get close with some various hardware synths, but if you\u2019re looking for one great, affordable solution that gets you the sound of these synths, I highly recommend Arturia\u2019s V-Collection. V-Collection is a package of softsynth emulations of all the classics, that run on your Mac or PC (VST or AU). While V-collection isn\u2019t a \u201ctrue analog\u201d hardware synth, or any type of \u201ckeyboard synthesizer\u201d, the software emulation sounds incredibly good. https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/v-collection/overview#en ",
