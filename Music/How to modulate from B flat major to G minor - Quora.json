            "answer_text": "There are always three ways to modulate (I take it you mean actually change key, and not just temporarily use a Gm chord in the key of Bb, which is easy. Just use it.). The hardest one is the last one, which is why they make you practise it so much in theory class, because the other two are so simple they need no practice at all. Direct modulation. Just go to the new key with no preparation. This can be jarring, but then again, that\u2019s the point. Bb to Gm is so gentle, however, that you might not even notice it. One of my favourite direct modulations is into the bridge of \u201cSmoke Gets In Your Eyes\u201d, where the A section ends on a C chord, then the B section just comes down like a hammer on an Ab chord, still with a C in the melody. Then he works his way gently back to C for the last A section. Lovely.Tonicisation. Precede the new chord with its V7, or any combination of cadential chords. This is the tried-and-true method used by cocktail musicians to create impromptu medleys since forever. So after cadencing on Bb in the second-last bar, just play D7 in the next bar which brings you inevitably to Gm on the downbeat of the new section. Or instead of D7, play Am7(b5) - D7. Or any other cadential combination that leads to Gm.Pivot-chord modulation. This is more complex, but it is the gentlest way to change key. The idea is to go through a series of chords where one or more of the chords can be heard as being from Bb, OR from Gm, so by the time you actually get to Gm you have been lulled into thinking, \u201cOh, I guess we were already in Gm!\u201d But, as I said before, Bb and Gm are so closely related (they are the relative major and minor of each other; they share a key signature! Can\u2019t get any closer than that!) that almost literally any chord from either key will serve as a pivot chord. Most modulations are harder than that, so the pivot chord(s) are fewer and harder to use. Here are a few, but I\u2019m barely scratching the surface because this is literally the easiest modulation ever. Every chord except the D7 could be thought of as in Bb or in Gm.Bb Cm | F D7 || Gm Bb Cm | Am7(b5) D7 || Gm Bb | F D7 || Gm Bb | Eb D7 || Gm Bb Eb | Am7(b5) D7 || Gm (or use Cm instead of Am7(b5)) I haven\u2019t bothered with more advanced jazz cadential chords, nor modal resolutions. If you know about these and can use them, use them instead of the D7. ",

            "answer_text": "First things first, the g minor chord is a vi (submediant) in B flat Major. Here\u2019s one simple way you could do it: I V6 vi (B flat-F/A-Gm if you like jazz chords) This is good because the V6 has an A in the bass that acts as a smooth transition between the two chords. Let me know if that makes sense! ",
