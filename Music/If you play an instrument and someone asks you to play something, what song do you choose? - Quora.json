            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s imagine I go out to eat in a restaurant with my friends on saturday night. At that restaurant, there is three pieces band playing pop songs. One of my friend knows I play guitar and he asks me to borrow the guitar from the band and plays a song. As a bedroom guitarist of course I will feel nervous and reject his request. But, he Keeps pushing me, so I reluctantly agree. I walk to the band, give some tips, and ask the guitarist if I can borrow his acoustic guitar to play a song for my friends. So I have a guitar in my hand and I have to play something with it. I choose the easiest song that I can play so I won\u2019t embarassed myself. The song is Square Hammer by Ghost. The band and my friends look at me and waiting for my playing. I play the opening riff, verse, chorus, solo, all to the way to the end. I bet none of my friends, the band, or any of restaurant\u2019s customers know the song that I play. Most likely they will ignore it after hearing it for a few second. The song is unfamiliar and doesn\u2019t sound good to be played alone with acoustic guitar. So I get back to my seat. My friends say nothing because they don\u2019t know what I play. Bottom line is I don\u2019t know and can\u2019t play popular song. I learn and play a song that I like, which unfortunately isn\u2019t popular. In reality, if someone asks me to play something on guitar, I will reject it because I know most people won\u2019t know what I play. So why spend time and energy to play for them. ",

Tell a joke.\u201d Then sometimes I do manage to rise to the occasion. If I have my fiddle near to hand, I might play \u201cForked Deer\u201d or \u201cFrosty Morning.\u201d If I have my guitar, I might accompany my own singing and play a song I wrote. ",
