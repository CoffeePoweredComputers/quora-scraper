            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a line in Beyonce\u2019s \u201cLove on Top\u201d that happens around 1:13 (\u201cc\u2019mon baby it\u2019s you\u201d). She combines falsetto voice with a fast run through several notes. If this is the kind of \u201ccurl\u201d you are asking about, then you can consider it a specific technique, and not something that comes naturally. In this passage, Beyonce\u2019s voice takes on the special character that you hear because of three qualities happening together: one, the very high falsetto voice, which has been called \u201cflute-like\u201d because of its being produced at the very top of the vocal range; two, the fast run through a triplet of grace notes; and three, a recording technique in which her voice is doubled briefly to make it pop out on the record.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about vibrato or riffs. Vibrato is that sort of waver/tremor in a singer\u2019s voice as they sustain one note. It can be learned or can be natural (if it\u2019s learned badly, you can tell). Riffs are when a singer moves their voice up and down through various notes. Riffs are learned, through lots and lots of practice. I can do vibrato but I\u2019m terrible at riffs, and I\u2019m not good at explaining either, so here\u2019s one of my favorite YouTube videos about it (seriously, it\u2019s super great):  Learn How To Sing / Curls, Vibrato & Riffs Here\u2019s one that takes a camera to the vocal cords of four singers while they\u2019re singing. Kinda cool. I\u2019m not putting the actual video because it grosses me out a little. Vocal Cords up close while singing Also, there are loads of videos of famous singers doing riffs and vibrato, but here\u2019s an actual human being singing vibrato and just a couple short riffs:  Girl sings \"Hallelujah\" down a well in Italy....Beautiful singing and echo! There are loads of videos on YouTube about learning to sing better. And even very little kids can learn to sing \u201cfancy.\u201d Good luck! ",
