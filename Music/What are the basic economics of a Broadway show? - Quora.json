            "answer_text": "Movies actually have LESS of a chance of recouping their investment (this shocked me!) You can't forget to factor in all the backstage talent too. Many earn more that the equity minimum. Some bring in $250,000 a year (department heads). It can cost a lot to run a show each week (Wicked, Lion King cost around $800,000 a week to run- this includes salaries, royalties, theatre rental, marketing and so on) These shows can also pull in $1- $1.5 million a week. When you get a blockbuster like those, they are big hits. Wicked has made over a BILLION dollars worldwide. And 1/2 a billion on Broadway alone.  Most musicals cost between $10-$18 million to get running. Some can make it back quickly, like in 6 months, others take their whole run to earn the investment back and many never do. Probability of recouping is around 1 in 5. Movies are 1 in 10. Here's a great article:http://www.entertainmentmarketing.com/2010/11/how-many-movies-recoup-their-investment/ ",

            "answer_text": "These days it takes millions to get a show on Broadway and can take a very long time to break even thus making it a huge financial risk.  Look at the 60+ million spent on Spiderman (still hasn't opened).  It would have to sell out for years to even get close to breaking even.  You also have to consider the size of the theater and the level of talent you hire. Big names cost big bucks.  Go on playbill.com and look up what each shows brings in per week in ticket sales.  It will give you an idea of the possible revenue each theater is capable of.  Also look at the size of your cast.  Equity minimum for a Broadway contract is $1,653.00 per week.  You need to consider the cost of sets, costumes, marketing, directors & choreographers, rehearsal pay, etc.  It is a major process but possible.  Look at some of the huge success stories.  Phantom of the Opera, Cats, Les Mis, A Chorus Line, Wicked.  These will give you an idea of what can happen if you put in enough time and thought before opening a show on Broadway. ",
