            "answer_text": "Dancing Queen was ABBA\u2019s only US number !# Billboard Hot 100 hit. They did have 8 top ten hits and many more top 40 hits. However, ABBA, despite all their success and legendary status as one of the world\u2019s most popular and successful artists, considered the US market to be something of a failure. They have said they felt like they didn\u2019t succeed in the US as much as they would have hoped. However, that was in years past. Thanks to their mega selling album ABBA Gold, which, I believe is 6 times platinum in the US alone, and the Mama Mia movie and soundtrack, and also additionally, their ever growing fan base and reputation over the years, I think it\u2019s safe to say that Abba should be happy overall with their success in the US. ABBA has two new songs that were supposed to be released early this year, but have yet to see the light of day. Which causes me to speculate that while they might simply be perfecting those two songs and reluctant to release them until they are simply magnificent, they might also have written and recorded even more songs and we might possibly see an actual whole album one of these days. It might just be wishful thinking on my part, but we\u2019ll see. :) Having said all that, while Dancing Queen is their best known song and did chart at number 1#, it is technically speaking, NOT their most successful charting Billboard hit. That\u2019s because, their smash hit Take A Chance On Me, which peaked at number 4# on Billboard\u2019s hot 100, actually stayed on the charts longer and racked up more Billboard points as it were. It\u2019s a technical point, but it\u2019s a fact. Also, the video itself is awesome for it\u2019s time. Before the days of MTV, and because ABBA was not fond of touring that often during their heyday, they made promotional movies, or videos for their songs. And here it is \u2026.  ",
