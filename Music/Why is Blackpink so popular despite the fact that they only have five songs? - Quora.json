            "answer_text": "BlackPink initially gained massive amounts of popularity right after debut (and even before) for one reason: They are under YG Entertainment. YG Entertainment houses Big Bang, one of the most successful and loved male idol groups, iKon and Winner, who are two popular (though not quite as successful) idol groups, and was once the company that managed girl group 2ne1 (who has disbanded). It is not uncommon to find in Kpop that fans of a certain entertainment company will automatically support (if not love) new groups, soloists and artists from that company. That, and, as YG is one of the richest and well-known entertainment company in South Korea, BlackPink has so much more exposure to fans of Kpop than a new group would in a fairly non-existent company. Their concept and music is nothing groundbreaking or extremely new (although clearly not common) in the Kpop industry. They are four physically attractive girls with various, fun, engaging personalities who (appear to, at least) love their fans dearly. But so is (almost) every other female idol. So why are they so popular even though they don\u2019t exhaust themselves pumping out album after album (like other popular girl groups, Twice and Red Velvet are doing)? Exposure Frankly, BlackPink isn\u2019t doing anything super different or new. They are very typical idols. This isn\u2019t anything bad at all. In fact, with the hundreds of current female idols (discluding any and all disbanded or retired female idols), it\u2019s near impossible to be different without being controversial (although, nowadays, controversial idols are also nothing new). I\u2019m not trying to insult them or undermine their popularity. They are talented, sweet, professional, and interesting. I believe that they deserve all the attention they are getting. But lets be real, they aren\u2019t responsible for most of the attention and love they have been receiving. ",

            "answer_text": "There are actually so many reasons! Their music: It's been a very long time since kpop has had a girl group with a concept like theirs. They show a badass, fun, playful but at the same time, mature image. Their lyrics are immensely empowering, and their songs never fail to make their fans feel good about themselves. They have also been compared to one of the greatest girl groups of the Korean music industry, 2ne1. They also received amazing promotion from their entertainment agency YG, one of the Big 3 agencies of South Korea. They are YG's only active girl group, as of February 2018. The response they received from people all around the world, even predebut, was enough to catapult them into success in such a short span of time. Their personalities: The Blackpink girls are known to be extremely relatable, warm and funny offstage. Yes, they slay their outfits, choreography, and stage presence, but off the stage, they are never hesitant to show their true, fun selves. While Ros\u00e9 is known to be the cute, sweet member, Jisoo is known as the savage, confident one. Jennie is the all rounder, often misunderstood as the coldhearted one but actually a very caring person, Lisa is the annoying but incredibly selfless maknae. They are all very close to each other, having stuck as a family through many tough times since trainee days. Not to mention, their fashion sense absolutely rocks. They're probably the most sought-after female idols for fashion brand at the present. You can witness their amazing personalities yourselves on their ongoing show, Blackpink House. Their fan service: Blackpink care about their fans, Blinks, so much! They hold fanmeets almost regularly, And they once prepared 100 Sandwiches themselves (With the help of a professional chef lol they're so cute). Unfortunately, it was raining by the time they got to the venue, but they still clicked selfies and gave autographs to as many fans as they could! It also helps that two of the members, Jennie and Ros\u00e9 can speak English, And that Lisa hails from Thailand. And of course, they are incredibly talented. Two of the members, Jennie and Lisa are rappers, while Ros\u00e9 and Jisoo are the vocalists. They also dance very well. Although their record for 2017 wanst very good I.e. one song in one year, YG has stated that they're working on a new minialbum, so we all have many things to looks forward to this year! :D ",
