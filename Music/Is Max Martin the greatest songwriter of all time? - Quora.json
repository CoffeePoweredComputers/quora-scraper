            "answer_text": "Questions like this are highly subjective. It depends on the kind of music you like, and the kind of music you understand. I see a couple answers below me stating that Max Martin pales in comparison to George Gershwin, Cole Porter, etc. I would beg to differ. First of all, we don\u2019t know that Mr. Martin can\u2019t write jazz standards with the best of them. I know that I love writing pop music, but if I loved writing jazz, I certainly could. If I had to list the twenty greatest songwriters of all time, I would certainly include Max Martin in that list. He has written multiple #1 hits for everyone from the Backstreet Boys to Katy Perry. He has five Grammy awards, and a net worth in excess of $100 million. You\u2019d have to be a fool to not include him. That list would also include Diane Warren, David Foster, Elton John, Alan Menken, Cole Porter, Paul McCartney, Stephen Schwartz, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and countless others. You see the variety of genres there. Everything from jazz to musicals. Without some definitive variables, it\u2019s tough to come to a conclusion that would satisfy everyone. Today, Mark Ronson and Shawn Mendes are writing #1 hits for everyone. They are great songwriters, and will go down as two of the best. But to be world-renowned, and world-recognized, is another level. Certainly if the question was \u201cis Max Martin the greatest POP songwriter of all time\u201d, the answer would be a definite yes. He, along with Dr. Luke, wrote or co-wrote a ridiculous number of #1 hits from 1990\u20132010. Martin is still writing for the likes of Taylor Swift and others. You could make an argument for Lennon/McCartney, but that would be if you consider that pop. I consider them a rock band, and singer/songwriter as the genre. Also, I consider the term \u201csongwriter\u201d as meaning you can write in multiple genres for multiple artists. I don\u2019t include someone like Bob Dylan, because while he was a brilliant writer for himself, he never branched out to write alternate genres, nor do I think he wanted to. He will go down as one of the greatest artists of all time (not my favorite, but I certainly respect him), but I don\u2019t believe he will go down as one of the greatest songwriters. I\u2019ve got to add, I love the hate on pop music man. It cracks me up. I didn\u2019t even read the replies and yet I knew someone would chime in ripping on pop music. Get it through your damn heads, pop is an art form. Writing a catchy hook, in the right key, for the right artist, that sells a million copies, is not easy. It\u2019s just as difficult as writing a piece from a musical with 11 key changes and nine tempo changes. In some ways more difficult because you have to keep the song interesting without having the option of randomly changing keys or time signatures whenever the listener gets bored. So top ten? Probably not, top twenty? Definitely. And most definitely deserves the utmost respect. If I had a chance to intern for Mr. Martin I would take it in a heartbeat.

            "answer_text": "Nope. Not even close. In order to consider him the greatest, you have to ignore a few of the truly greatest ever songwriters\u2026 George and Ira GershwinJerome Kern and Oscar Hammerschmitt IIRogers and Hart I mean, seriously\u2026 these three teams above are more responsible for laying the foundation upon which people like Max Martin have built their \u201cfame\u201d. And they wrote WHOLE PRESENTATIONS in the form of Broadway musicals, each of which contained no less than ten compositions apiece\u2026 with incidental music between. And many of their tunes became runaway hits, and to this day are considered among the best songs ever written, with no exceptions. Martin has penned or co-written a lot of songs. Good. But to consider him the greatest ever? Not even in the top ten. Those of us who actually know music history understand who are the greatest of all time, and the modern pop world doesn\u2019t actually contain but a few candidates. Consider the lyrical content of the songs Martin composed. Now compare it with the lyrical content of the three teams I mentioned above. Martin\u2019s lyrics are juvenile by comparison. They aren\u2019t even particularly \u201cclever\u201d. The wordplay is not even imaginative. But when you read the lyrics of what the three teams above wrote, you see clever, imaginative, witty, funny, tragic, sad, heartbreaking, soaring, triumphant and more. The wordplay is just brilliant. There\u2019s more to writing music than getting your song to number one on a chart. And Martin doesn\u2019t quite get that, in my opinion. ",
