            "answer_text": "I first heard of this years ago when Yusef Islam gave up all rights to his music (as Cat Stevens) and would have nothing to do with it. It was his belief that music and playing music were forbidden. As you might know, he\u2019s gone back to playing, with the understandable exception of a few songs he deems inappropriate for a devote Muslim to sing. He was asked about this and said that at first, he was listening to someone who took a very strict and conservative view of the faith. But he has since said that this was not a mainstream belief and that he now believes music is perfectly acceptable. I note that there are also some strict ultra-conservative Christian sects that believe that music, or frivolity in general are to be banned. There have been others that allowed only religious music. The Catholic church initially banned any form of music except vocal in the Middle Ages. Anything else, and anything using instruments, was if not forbidden then certainly not something a Christian should be doing. That is one reason (though certainly not the only) behind why musicians were considered unsavory characters (along with actors) back then. Even today, I have some friends who debate whether secular forms of music (e.g. Christian rock, praise groups in church) go too far. I was in (late 60s) what would be called a praise group (though we were really more like a Jazz orchestra playing church music). Several of the elders hit the rafters over that, one having a specific fit over my use of an electric bass in church. The group was quickly disbanded. I did get a laugh out of my conservative parents though. They were behind me but when the dust settled, no more orchestra. That left me asking my parents \u201cDo you really think God would rather hear my horrible, off key raspy flat non-inflected voice than my on-key, on time bass playing?\u201d My parents suggested that I\u2019d probably be best off using my bass far more often \u2014 even God\u2019s patience might be taxed with my voice.

            "answer_text": "In fact, when the the Moors ruled Spain some centuries ago, they brought with them a plucked, strined instrument called \u201cal oud\u201d (the oud), which later become known as the lute. The Spanish guitar also evolved out of this instrument, which was BROUGHT to Europe BY Muslims. In other words, Muslims were playing the ancestor of the guitar before the guitar even existed, so obviously Muslims historically were allowed to play a guitar-like instrument, and many continue to, even today. Guitar History: How the Guitar has Evolved  The Flamenco guitar is very closely related to the music played on this instrument, as you can hear from the above performance. ",

The fact that someone plays, or does not play, guitar in no way suggests that they are Muslim. This is Gisele Marie, a Muslim woman from Brazil.

There is the issue of how strict it is around where you live (just like how some Christian groups frown upon the guitar, even acoustic ones), but generally, yes, Muslims can play guitar. I am not a Muslim, but I know of Muslims who play (all I have to do is fire up Malaysian songs in Spotify, really. Or Bombino, but I'm not sure if he's Muslim). ",
