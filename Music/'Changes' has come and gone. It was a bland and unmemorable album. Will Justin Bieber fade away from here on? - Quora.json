But i do like some of his old stuff\u2026i mean hater or not everyone likes at least one song..However his new album was not it\u2026like was just worthless\u2026all the songs sounded the same\u2026i didnt even listen to some of the songs for more than 15 seconds..i was like alright next\u2026and ended up regreting for wasting my time on it. Not to mention that some of the songs were unreleased tracks from 2013 ..(just changed a bit) wich were inspired by selena gomez..and not his wife..which he claims so much. Even though the album was a huge flop\u2026jb is/was a big artist for a long time and i dont think he will fade away that fast The media is all up his ass.. he is even going on tour so a lot of people will start to grow interest on him again ( atleast 10% of his fanbase) So justin is not fading away\u2026not completely..not yet\u2026but for sure will never be as big as he was during purpuse.
