            "answer_text": "There are a plethora of jobs that you can work in the music industry without having a formal degree or diploma. Now, there are certain jobs within the industry that do require degrees (i.e. entertainment attorney). Other than those specific and particular positions, there really isn\u2019t anything that can stop you from really getting into the industry. The main driver of the music industry on the business side is relationships. The industry is built off of them and oftentimes is the main catalyst for the success of executives and artists alike. My suggestion is to find out what it is you\u2019d really like to do - how you can be an asset to the industry - and do your research. Then, reach out to people whom are in those particular positions for an informal interview to get an idea of what it is that they do. ",

            "answer_text": "What are your interests, musically-speaking? Are you always the person who knows the best new tunes and makes kickass playlists? Maybe try to get a job with a music streaming service, where you can do that for a living. Are you interested in the \u2018backstage\u2019 aspects of music-making? Maybe you could work for a music festival, or as some kind of technician/promoter/roadie for a touring band or for a venue, or in some kind of administrative capacity for a music organization. Music supervision for film and TV could also be an option. These jobs don\u2019t always need music degrees, but having a degree would certainly give you an edge. Or maybe you could be like me and work in a music library (you do need degrees for that, though). I feel you with this question, for sure, because I\u2019ve been there and I\u2019ve done a fair number of these kinds of jobs. I hope you find something great! ",
