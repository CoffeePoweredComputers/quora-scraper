            "answer_text": "I think it is accepted by most people that there was an emperor of France named Napoleon Bonaparte during the start of the 19th century. There are signs of his reign all over Europe. He destroyed the Holy Roman Empire and allowed a Prussian state to exists, he made Russia the super power it is today, and he promoted the glory of France making it a European superpower. In conclusion, there was a man named Napoleon Bonaparte who did many things in Europe, but if all that he did was great is a different story. ",
