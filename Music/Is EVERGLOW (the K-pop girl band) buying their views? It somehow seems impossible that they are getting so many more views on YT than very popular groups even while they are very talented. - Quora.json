            "answer_text": "It's common for catchy girlgroup songs to get this amount of views. Like yeah they have incredibly a lot but think about how all their title songs so far were the same concept, powerful/catchy and there's always more people expecting their comeback which makes it go viral each time. See how similar all their titles are - they figured what works and now use it everytime. There's huge hype surrounding them. But they don't have as many fans as you'd expect, it's really mostly just more and more people streaming one catchy song. I think that good example would be to look at Stray Kids vs NCT popularity. Stray kids have catchy songs, My Pace got so much views people thought skz is more popular than NCT. But they are not. Even if skz got double/triple views NCT has, their sales show how many people are actually fans who'd spend money on them. NCT is one of the group's whose MVS aren't usually streamed by general public, mostly just by their fanbase. Oneus sold more albums than Everglow. If they were to tour, they'd have many fans knowing all their songs wanting to attend the concert. For Everglow people would know only those three songs. Not sure what I'm talking about anymore I'm tired but you get my point. ",
