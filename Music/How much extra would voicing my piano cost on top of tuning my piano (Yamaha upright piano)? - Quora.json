            "answer_text": "It would be better to get a technician to answer this\u2026 but I don\u2019t see any other answers. I looked around online; it was harder to find information than I thought it would be. The only source that put a dollar figure on it said roughly $125 for \u201csteam\u201d voicing, and $250 for traditional needle voicing. I admit I don\u2019t know what steam voicing is. Those numbers sound low, though. A tuning costs somewhere around $150, and takes about 1.5 hours, plus maybe a half hour drive each way. So, assume you\u2019re paying $60/hour for the tuner\u2019s time. Doing a voicing right is at least a half-days work. That does suggest $250 or so for four hours of work, but I think that\u2019s a lowball estimate. Needling each of the hammers to get them to the right hardness sounds like more than an afternoon\u2019s work. So go from there. ",

            "answer_text": "there\u2019s considerable variation in what technicians charge (correlates to cost of living in their area and fuel prices if they\u2019re driving around to clients). more variation in what a particular piano would require, in the estimation of the person doing the work. the first time our upright was voiced, it was over $200, the second time, a briefer session from a different and more experienced technician, $100. you also need to establish how you want your piano to sound after the work, because your expectations might not be feasible depending on the piano and how much it\u2019s been played.
