            "answer_text": "Most people _think_ they listen to almost everything, or claim they do. Mostly, I beg to differ . . . I usually say that I do listen to almost everything that has something interesting to listen to, something with energy (may not be \u201chot\u201d energy, or fast), just if there is something there. And usually it is played well to, but that is not necessary - some of the punk scene can have energy that I like, but they are not \u201cgood\u201d musicians mostly. My taste span from the ambience of, say Brian Eno, the minimalism of Philip Glass as well as the thumping minimal techno of, say Green Velvet or Adam Beyer. Orbital, Daft Punk, the Knife and the Orb as well as Meshuggah, Nasum and even the dark Burzum. Chill out to Miles Davis or Frank Zappa, enjoy Sparks or Queen. I do enjoy Fear Factory and Igor Stravinskij, Vivaldi and Abba. Beatles, Kate Bush, Yes, Genesis of course - or the voices of Trio Bulgarka. Nice grooves from Bootsy Collins or Chic, Earth Wind and Fire. Throw in some Toto or Danko Jones makes me happy. R\u00f8yksopp, Ace of Base and Flash and the Pan, AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Jidenna. There is good Drum n Bass from old to new ( I would include Dubstep and it\u2019s ilk here). Sadly I don\u2019t pick up much new stuff these days, but I try to sample bits and pieces so I refresh my palate. One thing is that I always try to listen to things 3\u20134 times before I say anything, and never take an elitist point of view. Edit: Spotify have dramatically changed the fact that i didn\u2019t get any new input with their two playlists \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d and \u201cRelease Radar\u201d. The second is golden because it plays new music that I might like - and 90\u201395% of the songs is like that. The first is more like a mix of old and new that I might like - and it is as if Spotify hired another me to make mixtapes. Both these are new every week! Wohoo :D ",

            "answer_text": "I tell them I have no taste: I\u2019ll listen to anything. I am one of those people who, when he says \u2018I like all kinds of music\u2019, means it. It\u2019s not actually true, as I really don\u2019t like (for example) Nazi marching band music, and I don\u2019t much like U2, indie rock, Steve Reich or Tchaikovsky. But other than that, from medieval organum to Arabic hip hop, I\u2019ll listen to it. An important moment for me was when my then-wife and daughter went camping a couple of years ago; we were stuck in traffic and the car stereo was linked to my daughter\u2019s iPod nano, so it was pretty much wall-to-wall contemporary pop music, which I never normally listen to. I realised that I definitely did like Taylor Swift, was very much so-so about Katy Perry, and had only limited patience for \u2018All About the Bass\u2019. Lately I\u2019ve been listening to a huge amount of Pat Metheny, for some reason. One of the great things about liking all kinds of music is that life is just not long enough for you to discover all the great music out there. I love the feeling that there are brilliant musicians whose work I will never get around to exploring. In the meantime, if you haven\u2019t heard Metheny\u2019s 80/81, do yourself a favour. ",
