            "answer_text": "In some ways singing the songs you remember singing well (and enjoying - very important) would give you a good reference point as to where your vocal fitness currently stands, but I wouldn\u2019t say that singing those songs is the best way to \u201cBring Back\u201d your original singing voice. Our voices are dynamic, fluid, constantly changing. A person\u2019s voice is a great indicator of their current health and can also reveal a lot about their recent history, and their life story. I think of Ramon Mirabet, a Spanish singer who has a very distinctive raspy timbre to his voice- and it tracks with how Ramon lives. He\u2019s always been singing, and he is incredibly effusive and friendly so he talks a lot, too. This makes his voice strong, from consistent use, but also its worn-in, and people from Spain are influenced by the permeation of flamenco culture- and that rasp is found a lot in flamenco singers who often have to sing over guitar and cajon and the clack of the dancers that accompany them. Depending on the point in your life you\u2019re thinking of when you say \u201cyour original singing voice\u201d it might be from a time when you had less strain on your voice, or when you sang every day, or when you were young and your vocal chords had a lot of resilience and you could sing and shout all day, be hoarse by nightfall and wake up with a full voice to do it all over again- and those were the best days, Salud! to childhood summerz. If you want to bring back a strong and healthy voice there\u2019s a very tried and true way to do it, you need to do vocal warmups, scales and arpeggios and focus on breathing, concentration and the ability to smoothly transition between the chest voice, head voice and falsetto registers. You need to do this every day, starting with 20 minutes and building up to an hour. The best way to get into this routine and make sure your doing it correctly is to work with a trained vocal coach who will teach you how to work your voice out the same way you a fitness coach helps you train your body to build strength, endurance and flexibility. Focus on making the most of the voice you have now, and relinquish the idea of time-traveling to a version of your voice that lives in the past. ",

If it has, I would suggest finding a speech therapist to work with. To the more general case, probably not. Age, damage from shouting, smoking/pollution and illnesses, and physical changes develop your voice over the years. with proper vocal training and yes, some practice, you might get pretty close to your \u201coriginal singing voice\u201d.

Muscle memory from when you first learned them will probably make you sing them in a similar fashion, but if you hadn't reached puberty yet or have sung improperly or abused your voice since then the voice won't sound the same.
