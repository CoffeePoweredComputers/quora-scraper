            "answer_text": "Firstly, in 2019 when the 9th Generation of Intel chips and Ryzen Processors are all the rage, why are you interested in such older chips. Ryzen 3 or Intel i3 8th or 9th gen will easily give more than double the performance power that you can expect from both these older chips combined. Now for your answer, if you are looking for a Desktop chip then go with the i5 3nd Gen but if you are looking for a mobile laptop chip then go with the i3 5th gen. Lastly, if you are wise enough then compare the prices of both these chips with any of the latest i3 from 7th, 8th or 9th gen or from Ryzen 3 so that you can make an updated 2019 system instead of a vintage one.
