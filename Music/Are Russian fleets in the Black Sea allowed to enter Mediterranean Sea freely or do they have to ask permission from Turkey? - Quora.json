            "answer_text": "No, Russia does not need Turkish permission to sail south into the Aegean Sea. Per the Montreux Convention, Turkey, during times of war or when it feels it is under the threat of war, has the option to exercise complete control over the straits in terms of the ships belonging to countries with which it in conflict. Note: Corrected per comment from Nicolae Tudosie. Some interesting facts about the Montreux Convention: Submarines belonging to non-littoral states (i.e. those countries that do not have a shoreline on the Black Sea) must transit at daytime, and navigate through the surface.Military ships with aircraft are inhibited from using the aircraft at any time during their transit through the straits.Turkey must be informed at least eight days ahead of time prior to the transit of military ships.In terms of its longevity and continued legal standing, the convention is one of a handful of such agreements in the world.",

            "answer_text": "It is complicated. According to Montreaux Convention, which regulates passage through Turkish straits, all states must inform Turkey for their warship passages through straits . Non-Black Sea states have to notice Turkey two weeks ago while Black Sea states including Russia have to do that one week before passage. This process is defined as \u2018notice\u2019, not \u2018permission\u2019. Secondly, aircraft carriers and submarines cannot pass through straits. Black Sea states have some exceptions; they are allowed to send submarines through the Straits, with prior notice, as long as the vessels have been constructed, purchased or sent for repair outside the Black Sea. One more exception especially for Russia is aircraft carriers rule. Kuznetsov (a pretty big warship embarked on aircrafts) could pass through Straits as \u201caircraft carrying cruiser\u201d. Technically she is not \u2018aircraft carrier\u2019 according to the Turkish and Russian definition.  ",
