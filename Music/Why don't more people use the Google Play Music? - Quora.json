Truth is, Spotify is better at nearly everything that matters: Spotify gets that people want to listen to an even mix of old favorites and new potentials, which they accommodate via their Daily Mix feature. Google makes you pick either/or (you can listen to a saved playlist or an impersonally-curated station).Spotify also offers Discover Weekly, which is a well-tuned way of finding new music that you\u2019ll probably like. Google, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t even offer a predictive service. Despite their enormous machine learning advantages, it seems like they don\u2019t value the product enough to use said technology to improve it.Spotify understands social. Sharing songs is fun and intuitive. They also understand the role of musical tastes in self-identity, exemplified in their integration with Tinder and other millennial apps. Google, in contrast, is the company that invented G+.While both services offer Family Plans that multiple users can share to lessen the cost, Spotify has a far better network effect (more existing users means you\u2019ll have an easier go of finding friends to split with).As a free/bundled service, Google Play is a decent music library. But the paid version is a hard sell considering far better competitors charge the same rate. ",

            "answer_text": "I started using Spotify first, just because it was what I\u2019d heard of. But I switched to Google Play Music a couple years ago when Taylor Swift pulled her library off of Spotify. It works fine for me, but that\u2019s because I usually know what I want to listen to. So 90% of the time, I listen to my own playlists. And I don\u2019t usually get bored with that; I\u2019ve been known to put the same song on repeat in the background while I\u2019m working for several days at a time. I agree with the other answers that when I try asking Google to choose songs for me, I\u2019m usually disappointed. They may be the world leaders in some areas of machine learning, but it seems like they haven\u2019t cracked the code for music recommendations yet. I thought about switching back when Taylor Swift opened her library again, but I haven\u2019t had a compelling reason yet. For some people I guess the social aspect of Spotify is important, but it doesn\u2019t matter to me very much. Or maybe I\u2019m just too lazy to set up my playlists all over again. ",
