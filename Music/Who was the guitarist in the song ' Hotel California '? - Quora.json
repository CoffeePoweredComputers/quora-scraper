            "answer_text": "The bulk of the credit most go to Don Felder here. Don wrote and originally recorded the music entirely by himself, all of the guitar parts \u2014 acoustic, electric rhythm, the dueling leads, and the bass as well. On the version we commonly hear from Hotel California, however, to the very best of my knowledge, each Eagles member learned their respective part, and played their (more or less) usual role: Glen Frey - acoustic twelve string Randy Meisner - bass Joe Walsh - electric/lead guitar Don Felder - electric/lead guitar The dueling leads in the outro section \u2014 Don Felder wrote both of those lead parts, but wrote one specifically with Joe in mind, attempting to create something in accordance with his style - according to various interviews. And I\u2019d say he did a pretty good job \u2014 I doubt anyone listens to those leads, and hears it as anything other than Joe Walsh playing like Joe Walsh. ",
