            "answer_text": "A MIDI enabled keyboard can send CC messages from all the controls it has, like the keys, rotary encoders, faders, etc. As long as it is convenient enough to use those control messages for your desired parameters in the DAW, It can perform seamlessly as a MIDI controller. You just need to know how to assign each control message to a different parameter in the DAW that you\u2019d like to control. The keys alone doesn\u2019t usually need any special assignment. If you only need the keys and the keyboard has MIDI enabled, then you can just connect the keyboard to the computer via USB or a MIDI interface and just select the appropriate port in the DAW. ",
