            "answer_text": "It depends on the type of \u201cbutton\u201d accordion in question and your personal \u201cfeel\u201d for it. But, if we're talking about the standard, classical-music types - chromatic button and diatonic piano accordion, the answer would probably be that a piano accordion is easier for beginners to understand. The whole concept of playing revolves around the notes you play, so understanding and knowing the \u201cwritten language of music\u201d is kind of a must, as opposed to guitars and such where you can play from tablatures and similar. The piano, or diatonic accordion has a placement of keys which is the same as one of piano - \u201cnatural\u201d bigger white keys and \u201csharp or flat\u201d black keys which are smaller. On a chromatic button accordion, first, you get several types of \u201csystems\u201d that are in use. Mind that everything said here stands for the free bass system as well. Western \u201cC griff\u201d, Russian \u201cB griff\u201d, Scandinavian griff (a kind of russian system in a mirror). The usual setup involves 5 rows, but it can be anywhere from 3 - 6. The first, outer three contain all the buttons necessary, the rest of rows are repetittions of the first three, for easier use and convinience of the player. The notes are arranged in a chromatic order from left to right and opposite, beginning from the first row\u2019s B note (Russian B system) and or first row's C note (Western C system). The Scandinavian system is kind of a mix of the previous two. Depending on the style and genre of music you're playing, a type of system you'll be using is worth considering, since music is kinda written with certain system in mind. Everything is smaller in the button accordion - since the buttons are smaller than keys on a piano accordion and they are arranged differently, so intervals and physical range between different notes is smaller. That comes in handy when playing, but it is much harder to get used to when learning, since you have more patterns to learn and it asks for better hand motorics. But, you get a LOT more fingering options and and a lot more intervals you can cover with your hand. Usually grown up players can cover somewhere around three octaves with a stretch of the hand. So, while it is easier to learn the piano accordion, the chromatic button accordion is easier to play when learned, and there is a much broader repertoire you can take on. ",

            "answer_text": " I have played the Cajun Accordion (button accordion) for many years, and in my opinion, I believe it to be easier to learn than a piano accordion. The main reason I say this is because the way a diatonic button accordion works. One either pulls or pushes on the bellows to get a note. Each button when presses will play one note on the \u201cpush\u201d and a different note on the \u201cpull\u201d. Because of this, there is a direct relationship between the note played and the bellows direction. (pull or push) On a piano accordion, it does not matter if one is pulling or pushing on the bellows, you will always get the same note for any one key depressed. Because of this, one needs to learn to divorce the bellows movement from the note being played. One needs to learn to do two things at once to successfully play a piano accordion. Whereas with a button accordion, since there is a direct relationship of bellows direction and note played, one can more easy tie these motions together in one\u2019s mind to be one motion. I\u2019m sure others might view it differently. ",
