            "answer_text": "Nice video and nice music! No, what he is doing to play this music is technically very easy, relative to the possible technical complexities on the violin. There are no tricky bow changes or string crossings, and his hands, believe it or not, are not actually going very quickly! He doesn't need to shift much, and the sound quality and dynamics don't pose any special challenges. That being said, it is hard to simply play the violin at all, and he does a nice job. This style of music requires some abilities to slide and coordinate the bow with the slides, and the musical elememts need to be understood and controlled; there are some meaningful components of any particular type of Music which are important to its listeners, so he needs to be able to reproduce and control them. He also is playing this Arabic music with a scale pattern which is typical of Arabic and Persian music, but not so easily accessible to western classical players. All of these elements are musical difficulties, not technical ones! ",

            "answer_text": "I only know a little about Arabic music (I actually really like it too!), and if it sticks with notes based on scales, then it should be okay to learn. Middle Eastern music often uses harmonic minor scales, which are weird at first to play on violin. It feels like you have to stretch way too much, but you get used to it. Some composers also experiment with quarter tones, which basically means that from one note to the next (like a C to a C# for example) there\u2019s actually another note that falls in between. So like we have half steps in Western music, they sometimes use \u201cquarter steps\u201d. This just blows my mind from a theory standpoint. Thinking about the violin and if someone were to play a melody, or some sort of note pattern, it\u2019s obviously possible, but you would need a tremendously good ear to discern the difference in pitch.
