            "answer_text": "It varies. Factors include the number of tracks, how many musicians and instruments need to be recorded, how well prepared they are, how many \u201ctakes\u201d it takes to get each track recorded and ow complex mixing and mastering are. My albums were mostly about 20 tracks (the double album was over 40). I pride myself on being well prepared before I walk into the studio to record. Most of the time I got tracks recorded in 1 or 2 takes. It took 2 or 3 studio sessions per disc. Mixing, mastering and such took about 2 weeks. Producing the physical CDs to another 2. (I do my own work for that.) So, call the total calendar time about 5 weeks. I have a dear friend that is an obsessive perfectionist. She records multiple takes of each and every track, often running through the process 8\u201310 times before getting something he can live with. Getting one of her albums \u201cout the door\u201d can take 3 or 4 months. Both of us are solo acts. Working with a band runs up the time required a LOT. While I\u2019ve heard of bands getting everything for an album recorded in a marathon session over night, that is unusual. Typically a CD for a band runs into months and can run into a year. Mixing and mastering for an ensemble takes a LOT longer. ",
