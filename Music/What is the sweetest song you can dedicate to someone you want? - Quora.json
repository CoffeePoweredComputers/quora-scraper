This song is not that popular but it is sweet and easy to the ear. To you by Mason Jennings  I'm gonna say what I've wanted to saySince I first saw you on that rainy dayWhen you caught me lookingAnd I made you laughHoney I know you, I always have And if this world is just a random betThen there'd be no good reason why we would have metBut if there's something biggerIf there's something plannedHoney I want you to understand That every beat of my heart is proofI've spent my life tryin' to get back homeTo you, oh... I'm gonna do what I've wanted doI'm gonna trust my heart and give it back to youEvery time I speak, I want to say your nameHoney I know you feel the same When we're talking and you look at meI feel a distant memory coming back to meLike my own reflection on a quiet lakeHoney I see you, there's no mistake And every word that I say is trueI've spent my life tryin' to get back homeTo you, oh... I'm gonna be who I've wanted to beI will become the man who you deserve from meNo more hiding out under mountains of fearHoney we're breaking out of here The open road and the sky aboveNothing can hold us back from the things we loveYou need not save your strengthUntie your safety ropeYou will not need it, all you need is hope And every dream that we have is trueI've spent my life tryin' to get back homeTo you, oh...
