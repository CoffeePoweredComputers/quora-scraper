            "answer_text": "Oh boy oh boy oh boy \u2026 So you\u2019ve said \u201cif you must watch only a few episodes\u201d, but only Jon Mixon and Loreen De Kort have had the self-restraint to stick to just a few episodes. I, too, lack all sense of self-restraint, because Star Trek is ace. *adjusts Spock ears* So the question is: how do you want to choose? What criteria would someone in whatever year this is use to decide which Star Trek episodes were must-watch and which ones to let through to the \u2018keeper? I mean, let\u2019s face it, as Fry put it, \u201cSeventy-nine episodes, about thirty good ones.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of Trek that you might enjoy, but also probably wouldn\u2019t regret skipping. So here are the reasons I\u2019ve used in this assessment: Enjoying pop culture osmosis, aka helping you get jokes. Pop culture has been riddled with Star Trek references ever since the USA and USSR decided to blatantly rip off Gene Rodenberry by going into space, just like the crew of the Enterprise did. Certain episodes have wormed their way into the zeitgeist and should really be watched, just so you can understand what the rest of the world is talking about.Understanding Star Trek, aka getting a cross-section of the episodes that people talk about when they talk about how great Star Trek is. Which episodes best typified the show, and help explain its enduring appeal?Just plain quality episodes, aka just plain quality episodes. Which episodes may not fit into the above criteria but are just too darned good not to miss?Appearing in one category doesn\u2019t preclude appearances in any others, mind \u2014 some episodes belong in all three! I\u2019ve prioritised them in the order above, because we all like Futurama. Pop culture osmosis These episodes may not be good (although they often are), or even pretty representative (although they often are), but they include and explain elements that you see all over pop culture.  The Menagerie, in which footage from the original failed pilot, The Cage, is reused in a desperate attempt to find extra scripts when the season ran short. It\u2019s actually a pretty cool episode; Spock kidnaps Captain Christopher Pike, who\u2019s become severely disabled in some radiation accident, and runs away with him to a mysterious planet.  Arena, in which Kirk fights a humanoid dinosaur in a rubber suit at Vasquez Rocks. There are many other good things about the episode (including a firefight on foot in the early stages), but it\u2019s the dinosaur that\u2019s remembered, and rightly so. Arena was brilliantly referenced in Bill and Ted\u2019s Bogus Journey.  Amok Time, in which Spock gets so horny that he attacks Kirk. We\u2019ve all been there. This episode introduces us to Vulcan for the first time, and includes one of the most iconic fight scenes of the series.  Mirror, Mirror, in which Kirk and an away team swap places with their counterparts from an evil mirror universe. This is where we got the \u201cgoatees are evil\u201d clich\u00e9 from, and it\u2019s a damn fine episode to boot. Watching this episode will help make sense (well, to an extent) of the mirror universe episodes of DS9 and ENT as well.  The Trouble with Tribbles, in which tribbles appear and act tribblic. You\u2019ll want to watch it just to get the full effect of DS9\u2019s Trials and Tribbleations, and also just to understand what the whole deal is with tribbles, anyway. Includes my favourite interactions with the Klingons in all of TOS.  Gamesters of Triskelion, in which \u2026 some nonsense occurs with gladiators and gambling and such. It\u2019s not a great episode, but just about everyone of a certain background uses this or Amok Time as the reference when doing a fight scene, so it\u2019s worth a look for that alone.  Let That Be Your Last Battlefield, in which the dudes that are half-black-half-white or half-white-half-black appear! This is possibly the most famous episode in the history of Star Trek. It\u2019s also the only good one in all of Season 3! Just kidding. It\u2019s not actually very good. But it sure is iconic! Understanding Star Trek  The Naked Time, in which the crew come down with a virus that removes their emotional control. The episode gives us some clever insights into the minds of the main cast, and features some incredible acting from Leonard Nimoy (and some unmissable cheese from William Shatner). It also might help explain why TNG felt like The Naked Now was even remotely a good idea.  The Balance of Terror, in which the Romulans are introduced for the first time. Notable for introducing the Romulans; possibly the best use of space battle tactics anywhere throughout the series; and for its ruminations on the nature of war, the honour of soldiers, and the wastefulness of racial prejudice. Balance is straight-up my favourite episode of TOS, and I know I\u2019m not alone in that.  The Return of the Archons, which was ripped off by the makers of The Purge. This is possibly the best episode showcasing Kirk\u2019s second-best-known character trait, but to reveal what that is would be a spoiler \u2026  Space Seed, in which Khan Noonien Singh is introduced. It\u2019s frequently hailed as a classic, largely because Ricardo Montalban is amazingly good in it, and The Wrath of Khan is a direct sequel. TWoK, however, is about maturity, and confronting one\u2019s fears, and sacrificing for one\u2019s friends, while Space Seed is about how if you\u2019re charismatic enough you can be a raging murderous fascist (not to mention misogynist) and lesser men will cheer you on. I\u2019d call it a must-watch because of its influence on the rest of the series, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a good episode.  A Taste of Armageddon, in which two warring civilisations have discovered that by having computers simulate each attack, and soldiers and civillians voluntarily report for execution, they ensure that each side can continue to report victories without damaging infrastructure. This is a deeply angry episode, bitterly satirising the invisible, \u201cclean\u201d wars that began to occur around the time (and that we continue to enjoy today). If any episode epitomises TOS\u2019s reputation for moral and social commentary, Armageddon is it.  The Devil in the Dark, in which every single \u201cmonsters vs miners\u201d clich\u00e9 is played out for possibly the first time. If you\u2019ve watched television in the last 50 years, you\u2019ve seen someone try to rip off Devil in the Dark. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the episode is grouse.  Plato\u2019s Stepchildren, in which the crew are captured by sadistic godlike aliens (again) and forced to carry out horrifying acts. On the bright side, it features the first interracial kiss ever on television. On the downside, the only way they got it past NBC was by making the kiss an act of mind-control by evil aliens. Also, Nicholls and Shatner were not getting on at this point, so you can imagine how they felt. Still: history was made. Just plain quality  Where No Man Has Gone Before, in which a Negative Space Wedgie gives one of the crewmen godlike powers. Notable as the second pilot (after The Cage bombed horribly), and so there\u2019s a lot of early instalment weirdness going on (although you\u2019ll note that, even here, Kirk\u2019s still managed to rip his shirt). However, it\u2019s still a very strong episode with an interesting premise and a terrifying problem.  The Corbomite Maneuver, in which the crew are plunged into a no-win scenario by an overpowering alien ship that threatens death and refuses to negotiate. A surprisingly effective meditation on the way we face death; the alien is also considered iconic. (This was the first episode I ever saw, so I have something of a soft spot for it.)  The Galileo Seven, in which Spock leads an away team studying a Negative Space Wedgie. Things go horribly wrong, and Spock is confronted with the limitations of logic and the difficulty of leading a human crew.  The Squire of Gothos, in which Kirk and the bridge crew are imprisoned by an irritating yet somehow charming god-like being. The episode aged badly, since it\u2019s been copied over and over again (including by Trek itself, pace Q), but looked at without preconceptions it\u2019s a very good example of the trope.  City on the Edge of Forever, in which Kirk and Spock chase a crazed Bones to pre-War USA and try to undo the damage he\u2019s done to history. They discover a horrifying Trolley Problem at the centre of Bones\u2019 actions and have to deal with the emotional consequences. City is generally cited as the best episode of the Original Series and one of the best episodes of the entire franchise (up there with The Inner Light of TNG and The Visitor of DS9). The time portal thingy has become somewhat iconic, but otherwise it\u2019s not an episode that\u2019s first on the lips of non-fans, and that\u2019s something of a shame.  Journey to Babel, in which the Enterprise plays host to a \u2026 host \u2026 of diplomats. This episode introduces us to Spock\u2019s parents, who are wonderful. The episode itself is fun, also, and is a rare chance in TOS to see a lot of aliens at once.  The Ultimate Computer, in which a scientist tries to make the case for self-driving starships. Includes some great acting from William Marshall, and some entertainingly dodgy assumptions about automation. (For about the last 15 years, I\u2019ve associated startrek.com\u2019s sometimes idiosyncratic choices of episode icons with these episodes. So that\u2019s where the images come from.) ",

            "answer_text": "Hm. Should I steer you toward only the Best episodes, or should we go for a more balanced approach? Here goes: TOS (The Original Series) The Corbomite Maneuver: This early episode laid the groundwork for a major theme of Star Trek: to challenge the audience to look beyond the surface of a person, and find out who they really are. Great first appearance by Cliff Howard, then of \u201cGentle Ben\u201d fame, who has appeared in almost every other iteration of Trek in the ensuing decades, as well as running Eaglebauer Enterprises. (We\u2019ll see who gets that one). The Menagerie: Pts I and II: It is worth remembering that when Star Trek originally aired in 1966, the budget for TV shows was extremely paltry. Even after a relatively large-budget hit like the Twilight Zone, TV executives seemed to think that a SciFi show could be produced on the same budget as a Western. There were a great many episodes that had to be extremely thrifty, simply because there was no money for extra footage or special effects. One of the most clever ways in which this was accomplished was by melding the original pilot episode \u201cThe Cage\u201d into an episode about an older and debilitated Fleet Captain Pike, and the story of his strangest encounter. Extremely well done. Tomorrow is Yesterday/Space Seed/Devil in the Dark/Errand of Mercy/The City on the Edge of Forever: All classic episodes, all very well done, great content and ethical dilemmas . Well written, well produced, this is when Trek hit its stride. Unfortunately, NBC was already trying to oust them from the lineup. Catspaw/Friday\u2019s Child: Oy. With episodes like these, it was little wonder that NBC was planning to axe the new show after the 2nd season. Examples of how they tried to save money, but failing miserably on production value. Mirror, Mirror/The Trouble With Tribbles. Two of the best episodes of the entire franchise. These are the episodes that, quite frankly, saved the series for another season. Great writing, fantastic ideas, humor, quotable lines \u2014 everything Trek became known for are in these two great hours of television. The Mirror universe would take on a life of its own in DS9 and Enterprise. And Tribbles, what\u2019s not to like? Spock\u2019s Brain/The Way to Eden: Oh, my. Another supremely bad set of episodes. But, worth seeing just for the line \u201cBrain and brain! What is brain?\u201d, and hearing a very young Charles Napier as a space hippy singing \u201cHeading out to Eden, yea brother!\u201d Requiem for Methuselah: An excellent episode that deals with immortality and the inherent dangers of long life. After that, Next Gen/Deep Space Nine/Voyager and Enterprise will make a lot more sense. \u2014JB ",
