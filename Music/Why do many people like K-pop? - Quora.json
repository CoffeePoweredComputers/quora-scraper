            "answer_text": "I think there are a lot of factors for why people love Kpop. For one, it\u2019s very different from normal pop and is extremely diverse. Also, Kpop idols are usually multi-talented and almost all can dance extremely well. Kpop first draws people in with its amazing visuals and then gets them hooked on its catchy music and elaborate dance routines. Kpop singers are very active on social media and have frequent meet and greets, which makes their fans feel closer to them as well. It\u2019s like your favourite Youtube vloggers/Instagram stars, but with money, music, looks, and talent. Kpop idols work extremely hard as compared to Western singers, who only write and sing their songs, and sometimes don\u2019t even do that, choosing to instead hire songwriters and lip-sync on stage. Kpop idols practise at least 8 hours a day every day and it shows in the quality of their dancing and singing. Not to mention the years spent training before they debut. Most Kpop idols have stated that they only get 1\u20133 hours of sleep on most days, due to their very busy schedule of appearing on programmes, performances, interviews, training, recording songs, composing songs, choreographing the dance moves, and exercising. It\u2019s not surprising that you always see them sleeping everywhere. You just have to appreciate all the work that they put in. Lastly, the MVs. A K-pop MV can cost up to half a million dollars when clothes, settings, special effects, transportation, the directors\u2019, producers\u2019, actors\u2019, editors\u2019 and make-up team\u2019s salary are all put together. American MVs are just close-ups of people\u2019s faces and people almost-kissing-but-not-really-kissing/lying down and singing. Only rarely will you find an interesting music video, and even then it won\u2019t have the great acting, gorgeous sets, fascinating plotline, perfect dancing and overall quality that a K-pop MV has.

            "answer_text": "While I'm biased in the sense that I primarily listen to BTS' songs, I will do my best to give you some points to think about, while maintaining as much objectivity as I can (thank goodness college set me up for this). I've listened in on K-Pop since Super Junior, Girls\u2019 Generation, 2NE1 and BIGBANG, then stopped for a long time, only listening to the rare bop song once in a while, then got back into it but only with BTS. In my personal opinion, there is a lot more complexity to this group that warrants its current degree of success, so I'll not use them as an example and focus on broader points about why people would like \u201cGeneric K-Pop Group A,\u201d if that's okay with you. #1: Looks. No denying it. The majority of K-Pop fans *are* teenage/young adult females. So the abundance of \u201chot boys and girls\u201d in the industry definitely attracts them to it. And because each group, and each member in a certain group tries to fill a certain niche, looks-wise, you can get pretty boys, badass women, gangster guys, cutesy girls and everything in between. Crushes galore, and it can get out of hand at times. #2: Musicality. To generalize, the reason why J-Pop didn't break through international markets is because they refused to accept Western sounds into their style. K-Pop, on the other hand, is a mix of J-Pop roots and embraced Western styles such as hip-hop and EDM. To international listeners, they're both familiar and unique in their own way. There's a distinction between K-Pop and Western pop. One of the reasons why is because, for the longest time, many hit songs have followed a cookie-cutter formula on how to create, mix and produce these sounds and lyrics. Look at the structure of K-Pop lyric distribution and compare them to each other. It usually goes like this: \u201cad-lib intro, verse 1, pre-chorus, chorus, verse 2, pre-chorus, chrous, unfamiliar hook, intensified chorus, then a sudden cut at the end.\u201d Psychologically, this does something in your brain to incline you to want more of it, even if you don't like it. Girls\u2019 Generation's \u201cI Got a Boy\u201d diversified this structure minimalistically, and was a fresh breath of air for listeners that allowed it to become very popular when it first came out. #3: Inclusivity. Not only do K-Pop idols make music, but they're more connected with their fans. They talk to them more personally, on average, than Western stars through mobile streaming apps like V Live, social media and mass media. The South Korean psyche also revels in the intense, raw emotions of humanity (dread, wrath, humor, foolishness, etc.) that they dedicate various \u201cvariety shows\u201d to make idols release their sense of professionalism and show these emotions on air. This makes them appear to be more \u201creal\u201d for the fans to relate to. #4: Fan culture. Unlike internationally, Korean fanbases are *way* more dedicated to their idols. You actually have to sign up and pay a fee, and then wait your turn to be part of the official fanclub. Once in, you get exclusive memorabilia and opportunities to get goodies and pre-sale tickets to their fans meetings and concerts. This can be both good and bad for the idols. This means increased lifetime sales (how much a person spends on one brand loyally in a lifetime) once you get a person hooked on your group. These people will also spend their free time to vote for your group in upcoming awards and such. However, diehard fans are obsessive, clingy and very volatile. They not only will turn on others who don't like their group, but also on other fans and even their own group once they feel that they are \u201cbetrayed.\u201d They objectivity their biases and place them on a pedestal for the image of perfection. They fantasize they they will marry or elope with their biases. \u201cSaesangs\u201d are lunatic fans in particular who will actually stalk their idols. Very creepy, indeed. But to reassure you, the majority of fans, especially international ones are nothing like this. They will support their group mightily, but won't use them as a criteria to dictate their life (but will always joke about doing so). There are a lot more reasons as to why a certain individual may start to stan a K-Pop group, but these are the most common ones. Now the reason why I didn't include BTS in the picture is because, based on fan consensus compared to other fanbases, they're an outlier. They talk about many social issues relevant to youth and young adults today, they actively seek out to interact with their fans (without their company forcing them to) and they have this sort of \u201cduality\u201d in their personalities that make them seem more \u201chuman.\u201d They're way too complex for me to add into the mix, and outside of being a fan of them and instead as a marketing major, they have an impressive, consumer-oriented marketing strategy if you ask me, whether or not they appear as sincere or not to you. That's why I didn't include them. Hope this gives you some valuable insight in any way, and if you have any questions or arguments against the points I've made, please tell me as I would like to hear any of your opinions.
