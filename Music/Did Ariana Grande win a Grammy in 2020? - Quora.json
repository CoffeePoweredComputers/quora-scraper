            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, NO. She didn't win a Grammy(s). This decision was very criticised by fans and even Billie Ellish said in her speech (obviously, when she won Grammys) that so many talented and deserving people didn't get it (only telling you the gist). And she specially mentioned Ariana's name there, she was polietly and through gestures telling her to shut up and that Billie is worthy of the Grammy(s). There is a reason speculated by fans (including me) was that (they nominated her in 6 (not sure) categories but she won no awards) in 2019, Ari was fixated on performing a song which producers (or sponsers of Grammy Awards 2019) constantly refused and wanted her to perform another one. Hence she didn't go to Grammy Awards 2019 but the Grammy she won for Best Album was mailed to her (Sweetener released on 17th August 2018). Anyway the main point is that they wanted to humiliate her. But she's a QUEEN and will continue to be one. P.S.: Lana Del Rey\u2019s song Norman F***ing Rockwell should\u2019ve won for Best Song (Best Song \u2018Ever\u2019 for me). Sadly, Billie won a Grammy before Lana. ",

            "answer_text": "No, she was snubbed again. In 2019 she was meant to do a performance but didn\u2019t because the people who own the Grammys didn\u2019t let her perform the songs she wanted to. (first off no hate to billie) Billie Eilish won a whole 5 Grammys for herself and they used Arianas name in their commercials to gain attention. Everytime a Grammy was announced that she was nominated for she\u2019d look really smily and happy but as soon as she didn\u2019t hear her name, her face completely changed, although being the humble person she is, she of course congratulated the winners without holding grudges.
