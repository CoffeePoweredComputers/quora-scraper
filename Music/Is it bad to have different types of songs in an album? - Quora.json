            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a matter of opinion. Some people find it distracting to have lots of different styles of song on an album; I find it bracing. Some albums are the better for being wall-to-wall the same kind of thing.  (By Source, Fair use, File:HardDayUK.jpg - Wikipedia) The Beatles\u2019 1964 A Hard Day\u2019s Night is not only the first Beatles album to contain no cover versions, it\u2019s the only Beatles album to only contain songs by Lennon & McCartney. It\u2019s a big slab of uncut, slam-bang, woo-woo Beatlemania and the album I would recommend to anyone who wanted to get a sense of the early Beatles. I would compare it to an album I wouldn\u2019t normally have listened to but I recently enjoyed: Death\u2019s 1998 The Sound of Perseverance.  (By Source, Fair use, File:DeathSOP-1998.jpg - Wikipedia) It may seem perverse to compare a Beatles album to a death metal album, but really only the sound and lyrical content of the albums are different. They both have similar aesthetic principles (maximum impact, unity of timbre, consistent orchestration from one song to another) and they maintain a consistent mood throughout\u2014with the Beatles it\u2019s upbeat jangly guitar pop, with Death it\u2019s intense death-metal riffage, but deep down, both bands are trying to make the same kind of album. But the Mothers of Invention\u2019s 1969 Weasels Ripped My Flesh is, like most of the albums Frank Zappa oversaw, a series of stylistic shocks:  (By Source, Fair use, File:Frank Zappa Weasels Ripped My Flesh.jpg - Wikipedia) The opening track, \u2018Didja Get Any Onya?\u2019, is a live recording of the Mothers playing and goofing around and reciting bizarre dialogue. The second track, a cover of Little Richard\u2019s \u2018Directly From My Heart To You\u2019, is a devastating blues with a brilliant performance by Don \u2018Sugarcane\u2019 Harris on vocals and electric violin. The next track, \u2018Prelude to the Afternoon of a Sexually Aroused Gas Mask\u2019, is different again. And so on. One of my favourite albums is, like Zappa\u2019s work, deliberately constructed to jolt the listener out of torpor and be unpredictable, albeit for different reasons than Zappa\u2019s dada-inspired sense of fun: Robert Fripp\u2019s 1979 debut solo album Exposure.  (Cover art can be obtained from Discipline Global Mobile.Fair use, File:Robert Fripp-Exposure (album cover).jpg - Wikipedia) Exposure was Fripp\u2019s only attempt as a solo musician to make something like a pop album, and it\u2019s one of the strangest albums ever made, although nearly 40 years on it still sounds fresh and, in its forebodings about environmental disaster, even prophetic. Fripp doesn\u2019t sing on it; he hired Daryl Hall to be the main singer, but Hall\u2019s management made such a fuss about Hall\u2019s involvement that Fripp ended up substituting Terre Roche and Peter Hammill on many of the vocal tracks Hall had originally recorded. Peter Gabriel appears on it too, Fripp having produced Gabriel\u2019s second solo album. (There are multiple versions of Exposure knocking about, at this point, but I\u2019ll describe the 1985 version, which is the one I first encountered.) The album has been called \u2018the punk Sgt. Pepper\u2019 and for all that it has roots in prog, experimental music, soul and Fripp\u2019s own rather outr\u00e9 intellectual influences, there\u2019s something in that; it was made after he\u2019d emerged from his mid-70s adult education period and had been hanging around the NYC clubs marvelling at bands like Television and Blondie. It\u2019s easiest to briefly describe what each track in Exposure is like Preface: A brief audio recording of Brian Eno in a New York City falafel restaurant, saying \u2018Can I play you\u2026some of the new things I\u2019ve been doing, which I think\u2026could be commercial.\u2019 The background chat and clink of plates, etc., cuts out. A phone rings, and keeps ringing. A door opens. Footsteps walk across the stereo picture and the phone is picked up. Sound of a guitar down the phone, playing the ner-ner-ner-ner opening riff of:You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette: Frenetic three-chord punk song, sung not entirely convincingly by Hall, featuring Fripp\u2019s own lyrics. (Most of the lyrics on the album are by his then-girlfriend Joanna Walton.)Breathless: Intricate, leisurely prog-metal in weird time signature with very difficult riffs.Disengage: Angry rock song with shrieky vocals by Hammill.North Star: Airy and beautiful lilting ballad with fantastic Hall vocal.Chicago: Grungy sort-of blues with another tortured Hammill vocal.NY3: Lurching metal instrumental, a distant cousin of Hendrix\u2019s \u2018Foxy Lady\u2019, with dialogue recorded and looped by Fripp of a bitter family argument in his neighbour\u2019s apartment in NYC. (Sample dialogue, mother to daughter: \u2018You gotta go for an abortion, baby, I never had to!\u2019)Mary: Charming quasi-acoustic ballad with very nice vocal by Roche, tracking Hall\u2019s original vocal; Hall improvised the melody and Roche re-recorded it after Hall\u2019s management made a fuss.Exposure: Weird funk track, a cover of the same track from Peter Gabriel\u2019s second album, with Gabriel muttering the letters in the word \u2018exposure\u2019 on each beat while Roche shrieks the title word over and over again.H\u00e5\u00e5den Two: Grungy, churning, stop-time instrumental with vocal snippets between cycles of the chord progression\u2014one is, amusingly enough, Eno commenting \u2018Incredibly dismal, pathetic chord sequence.\u2019Urban Landscape: Haunting, quiet soundscape of Frippertronics, Fripp\u2019s tape-delay system which was first used on his an Eno\u2019s No Pussyfooting album. Slams right into:I May Not Have Had Enough of Me but I've Had Enough of You: Thrashing rock song with a gritty riff and a duet between Hammill and Roche as a duelling couple singing variations on the phrase \u2018That is the way it is\u2019, with celestial interlude featuring the title phrase.First Inaugural Address to the I.A.C.E. Sherborne House: Supposedly this is an entire lecture by the author and educator J.G. Bennett, condensed down to seven seconds long. It sounds like a brief burst of white noise.Water Music I: Bennett again, talking in his hesitant, gentle way about global warming and the imminent inundation of cities.Here Comes the Flood: Wonderful piano-ballad version by Gabriel of a song originally recorded as bombastic power ballad on his first solo album; this is far better, with just his voice and piano and some tasteful synth by Eno.Water Music II: Lush, post-apocalyptic Frippertronics. Long fade into silence. Followed by:Postscript: Eno again in the restaurant, saying with evident amusement \u2018So the whole story is completely untrue\u2026a big hoax,\u2019 and chuckling. \u2018A big hoax\u2019 is then heard looped and filtered, as if down a telephone, then the phone is put down, footsteps travel across the stereo from right to left, and a door slams shut.Like I said: a weird album. But certainly not one that lets you sit back and bask in a mood. It forces you to engage with it. So, it\u2019s not necessarily bad to have different types of songs in an album. I would, however, argue that it is bad to promise that you will have different types of songs in an album, and then not make good on that. Or, conversely, to strive for a consistent feel, and then end up making something that\u2019s all over the place (or boring.) ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes, it can be; The White Album, for example, covers way too much ground, not all of it necessarily in keeping with the Beatles\u2019 history up to that point. I think variety can work if it develops an artist\u2019s sound; the most obvious examples I\u2019m aware of would be The Fragile by Nine Inch Nails and Soundtracks for the Blind by Swans. With The Fragile, there\u2019s enough ambient tracks to constitute a genuine shift in mood and dynamic from NIN\u2019s previous albums, but there are enough industrial rock/metal songs that it can still be considered an industrial rock album, albeit one with strong art rock elements. Soundtracks for the Blind, on the other hand, contains a bit of every genre Swans had dabbled in up to that point; industrial, goth rock, noise rock, folk, and so on. However, that album had something new to contribute; there were some ambient tracks, and some songs had enough focus on the instrumental palette that they could probably be considered post-rock. It\u2019s a celebration of Swans history, while also further developing Swans\u2019 sound, and foreshadowing the drone and post-rock antics they would get up to in the current decade. ",
