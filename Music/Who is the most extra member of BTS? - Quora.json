But if youre talking about being extra funny then I would say all of them, but if you\u2019re talking about who\u2019s the most extra EXTRA funny of them all, it\u2019s gotta be the golden maknae.  This crackhead is sooooo annoying I HATE HIMMMM (sarcasm). He\u2019s not even my bias, cuz i dont have one reeeeeee!!! but kidding aside::  This man right here is capable of making people & armys laugh. In twt, he would eat aggresively just to make us laugh, he would imitate his hyung (e.g: Jimin\u2019s promise and Taehyung\u2019s Scenery), and would be extra in interviews. \u201ci like country side!\u201d, you can also watch this jungkook being a total crackhead for almost 7 minutes !! And there\u2019s a lot of videos in youtube of compilations of him making his hyungs/bts members laugh *heart eyes*. So enjoy these crackhead jungkook pictures.       - here\u2019s my JUNGSHOOK PHOTOS FOR YOU     Stream Dream glow and A brand New day!!! Thanks for reading Edit: Stream All Night by Namgi too uwu. and stream Lights when it release i purple u ",
