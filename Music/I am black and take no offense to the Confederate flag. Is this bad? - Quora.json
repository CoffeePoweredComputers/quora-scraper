            "answer_text": "I believe that it might be the case that you do not know enough information about the Confederate flag. However, you could completely not be offended by it personally but it is still a hate symbol. For example, if for some reason neo-nazis get normalized and you are part of the group targetted by them but you find someone supporting that not at all offensive there should be a little bit more research on it, and if you are still not offended by it does not take from the fact that it is a hate symbol. I am not sure if that answers your question but maybe it is that the flag does not trigger you but it is still very offensive to support such thing as the Confederation who fought to keep Black people as slaves and not count them as humans; they were against progression and I recommend you read a little bit more about its history, and truly I feel like people that have the Confederate flag does not actually care about their heritage and they just want to get in a drama like little middle schoolers since there really isn\u2019t a lot to be proud of. Nothing in this is really a fact is just my thoughts but yeah I hope this helped. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Actually no. Were you aware that what people think of as the \u201cConfederate flag\u201d is actually a battle flag under which a large number of black Confederate soldiers fought and died? Yes, it\u2019s true! Did you know that at Gettysburg the one statue that pays tribute to black soldiers there is the one from Mississippi? Sure is! When they had the Gettysburg Reunion about the time of WW1, black veterans were treated in different ways by their fellow white soldiers. The white Confederate soldiers had the black Confederate soldiers mix their tents in with theirs. The black Union soldiers had their tents placed in a designated area just outside of where the white Union soldiers had their tents. When people talk about blacks fighting for the south, many people fail to understand that the black soldiers were fighting for their homes just like the white Confederate soldiers were fighting for too. Honor ran deep in all men at that time period no matter where they were from and no matter what color or from whatever nationality they originally hailed. ",
