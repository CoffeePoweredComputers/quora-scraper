A HoneyPot is a trap set to make you think its a useful service but in the background watching are the hungry dogs ready to attack. Opera's new baked in VPN is NOT a good solution for your privacy! \u2022 r/technology Opera browser now comes with free built-in VPN \u2022 r/technology Where do you think the data you are using and your browsing activities passes through or is stored? Opera servers located either in Norway or USA. So whats wrong with that you will ask me? Well, Norway a country of rich brats, has more cyberlegislation that any other European country and retains massive amounts of data on you when you access the internet. They even consider streaming on free websites piracy, so you can guess the rest (what a bunch of morons). Look where Opera/SurfEasy ranks here: 20+ VPNs Rated on Privacy and Security Side-by-Side Now consider what they would do to user data coming through Opera VPN? Then there are US servers that Opera owns, I shouldnt even talk about that, this will turn out to be a privacy lesson then. Just being honest with you but the Inc. after the Opera says a lot to me, I dont know why others cant see through it. They are not our friends, they dont care what happens to us, they just want our data so they can deliver their measley product ads to us all day long. ",
