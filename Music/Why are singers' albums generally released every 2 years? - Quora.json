            "answer_text": "In the music industry, this is generally referred to as an \u201calbum cycle\u201d. What we mean is really from when you start promoting an album to when you stop promoting it. Most album touring cycles are at least a year, often 18 months and can be as long as 2 years. This generally means you can fit in two festival seasons, and festival season is when a band can make an awful lot of money. If you tour for much longer than this it\u2019s hard to keep building the buzz and you\u2019ll end up playing the same venues again. Going back to a city on an album cycle to play a bigger venue is fine, but going back to play the same venue on the same album not so much. After the approx 18 months of touring, 6 months to a year to write and record the next one is about normal, so this is where the approx every 2 years you\u2019ve noticed comes from. ",
