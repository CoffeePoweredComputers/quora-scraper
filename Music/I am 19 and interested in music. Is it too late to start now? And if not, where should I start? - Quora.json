            "answer_text": "As a guy who was a stranger to beat, rythm and melody for most of my 18 years, I developed an interest on music as soon as January, and it changed my world. Clapping along a song and dancing were beyond me simply because I had no talent and no previous experience with anything related - mostly because I haven\u2019t any imediate family interested in music: normally, a home tends to be filled with some sort of song, be it from a half-forgotten radio or a CD your mother or father loves or a brother who scratches at a guitar, but I had none of these; my house was unusually silent. Thus, as I grew up, I had little contact with pop, classical or historical music, and reached the tender age of seventeen with severely limited knowledge and only a peculiar taste for Power Metal from some measure of personal exploration. However, spending time with my girlfriend and her family - all of which had a habit of listening to music and good taste in it - made it clear how little I knew, but also how much I wanted to know. My girlfriend introduced me to many styles, bands and singers, and set some of the base for my preferences today; after listening to Eric Clapton, I began to love Blues, Rock, and Pop. Her sister and father, both deeply musical, instilled in me a deep interest in the guitar and the singing, and as of January, with nothing under my musical belt and hungry to learn, I started tapping my foot. That\u2019s just how I tell the story, though. In truth, the untrained foot hurts like the devil after a couple minutes of solid tapping, so instead I began to clap and snap my fingers to the beat I heard in every song. At first it was irrational and erratic, and I soon learned to pratice in private, but after a while - once I trained my ear - I picked it up more and more naturally. After I got a guitar for my birthday, and began praticing that too, it began to snowball. By now you have already a grasp of the point I\u2019m trying to make, but bear with me. As soon as things began to make sense, making music was not a thing to be cherished, but to simply the exercise of a natural instinct to create and explore yourself. Music is a beautiful way of speaking with whatever instruments you find in hand, and once you understand it, you begin to fall in love. I picked all the hard songs on the guitar as soon as I could, and though all said they were too much for the beginning, the passion I have kept me through the many mistakes and gave me great results. So, it is not too late - it never is. Start tapping. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s never too late to (learn) to \u2018make\u2019 music. The problem as people get older is they either don\u2019t have the time or won\u2019t TAKE the time to practice. To learn to play any instrument is going to take quite a bit of it. Maybe one in a million persons can pick up a guitar, for instance, and \u2018instinctively\u2019 be able to play like a pro, but most people are going to have to work at (study) it, and for many, this is a stumbling block. But you also have to decide why you want to learn. Is it for pleasure or because you want to \u2018teach\u2019? Do you want to lead an orchestra? Do you want to be a composer? Of course it will be easier for you at age 19 if you want to learn music for your own pleasure and satisfaction, but music is like a language, and it\u2019s no secret that languages are more easily absorbed by the young. That doesn\u2019 mean you are too old (at age NINETEEN!) to become a concert pianist or to lead the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA. Much of what you do in music will be driven by YOUR desire! Just know that if you decide on a \u2018career\u2019 in music it will be harder for you than someone who started learning the piano at age 9, for instance. But that doesn't mean it can't be rewarding/fulfilling for YOU! Get a good teacher, start learning an instrument! People often pick the piano because it is a composer\u2019s favorite, and it\u2019s easier to learn \u2018'MUSIC THEORY\u2019 on one : chord structure, keys and key signatures, intervals, types of notes, etc. You don\u2019t NEED to know much theory to play any instrument, but it may have more meaning and make more sense to you if you learn SOME at least! I didn't decide to become a 'MUSIC MAJOR' until I was about 16 years old, but I started in that direction when I was 14. It was the mid-1960's and the world was experiencing 'BEATLE-MANIA'. My best friend and I started a band. I liked PAUL MC CARTNEY and had a natural affinity for the BASS GUITAR. He was a natural leader and liked being 'out front.' He became the 'LEAD SINGER'. We played 'gigs' wherever we could, at our school, around our town, teen towns, universities, etc. (SIDELINE: If you are going to go the 'performing' route, realize that most weekends, holidays, and special occasions, while others are 'having fun', YOU will be 'ON STAGE!' YOU will be the 'ENTERTAINMENT!') And whereas staying up all-nite (or late at night) might be really fun when you are young, working until 2:00 AM (and LATER!) may not be as much fun in your forties and fifties and up. On the other hand, although I was tremendously shy as a boy, I was up on stage performing in rock bands when I was fourteen, and I did so off and on for the next 7-8 yrs. Though I changed my 'MAJOR' to 'PREMED/PREENGINEERING\u2019 after my freshman year, my love of music has been with me all my life, and I'm certain it has SAVED my life more than once! I went on to become a research diver and an engineer-diver, traveling all over the world. I never became a 'ROCK STAR' like I THOUGHT I wanted, but I still have the BASS GUITAR I bought brand new at age 14. It's older than a lot of the people I know! No matter what you do with music or IN music, it will make your life better! ",
