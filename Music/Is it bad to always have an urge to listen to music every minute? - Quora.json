            "answer_text": "There is nothing inherrently wrong with feeling the constant urge to listen to music. The problem is that listenning to too much music will probably make you numb to it, much like a soft drug. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love listenning to different genres of music and I often do depending on my mood and context. However, taking a break from time to time will help you feel it more intensely and deeply. If you are the kind of people to listen to music to \u201cget high\u201d, get absorbed with it to the point where it is the main thing happening at that moment, then listenning to it constantly will hurt your ability to enjoy it. But if you prefer playing music in the background and have no problem being productive and focused on other tasks than I guess it is okay to listen to it as much as you want. Or you can switch between the two, which is my prefered way of enjoying my music and it works better if you enjoy different kinds of music. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there could be some negative consequences to it. Listening to music is my biggest hobby, so I spend a lot of time with headphones in my ears (walking to class, running errands etc.). I have noticed that when I\u2019m always \u201cwired in\u201d I miss out on experiencing the world around me. I am not focused on my surroundings. I can\u2019t hear anything that is going on. I don\u2019t have the opportunity to have deep thoughts. I am also inexplicably letting other people around me know that I don\u2019t want to talk to them at all. This is just me, but I kind of want to have those aspects in my day to day life, and if I\u2019m always listening to music with my headphones in I am unable to experience those things. Like with pretty much everything else, practice with moderation. ",
