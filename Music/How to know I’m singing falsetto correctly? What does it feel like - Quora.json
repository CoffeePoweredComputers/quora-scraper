            "answer_text": "Singing in falsetto should feel easy, but is vocally ineffective. It usually lacks the power and focus typical of the middle/lower voice (lower vocal mechanism), especially in notes close to the vocal \u201cbreak.\u201d As you sing higher in falsetto, the notes do tend to take on more clarity and focus, such that eventually the voice regains the clarity of the middle/lower voice. To sing falsetto \u201ccorrectly\u201d is not difficult; if you support the tone and try to sound kind of like Mickey Mouse, you\u2019re doing it \u201cright.\u201d If you\u2019re wanting to employ falsetto technique in your regular singing, the preferred treatment is to engage a mixing approach so that the muscles primarily involved in falsetto production (the thyroarytenoid muscles) are \u201ctransitioned\u201d with the lower voice (the cricothyroid muscle) as the voice moves up/down the scale.

            "answer_text": "Well, the falsetto region is not as powerfull as the others, it must feel almost like a breeze, calm and soft. The falsetto is above the head voice, althought some people think they are the same, so find the passagio between this two regions, when it gets softier than the head voice you got your falsetto, and just like the other regions you must do it without effort in order to not damage your vocal chords.
