            "answer_text": "VST (Virtual Studio Technology) is a plugin format based on the C++ language, developed by Steinberg for their Cubase and Nuendo software and later opened up to third party developers. Steinberg make the software development kit available from their website. A lot of other non-Steinberg software makes use of the VST format, including other DAWs, video editing and CD mastering software. AU (Audio Units) is Apple\u2019s equivalent, originally built into Logic, but now part of MacOS and IOS architecture. These have similar functionality to VSTs, but are exclusive to software developed for the Apple platform. Although VST and AU are exclusive to the platforms that support them, there are \u2018wrappers\u2019 available that allow you to use VSTs in software supporting AUs and vice-versa, though they do come with a cost in CPU usage. Most audio plugin manufacturers provide the option to install VST or AU versions on installation, so functionally there is little difference between the formats. ",
