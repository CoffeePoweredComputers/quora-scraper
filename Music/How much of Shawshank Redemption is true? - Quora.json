I am willing to bet that there may even be prisoners and guards who bear the names \u201cAndy, Hadley, and Norton\u201d. That being said that\u2019s about the only truth in the story. Could it happen? What I mean is, could someone rig the financial and identification systems in place to create a new identity while behind bars and then tunnel out, assume that identity, collect on the profits that name has garnered, and then live a quiet and peaceful life in Zihuatanejo? Maybe, and that\u2019s a big maybe, then. But certainly not now. ",
