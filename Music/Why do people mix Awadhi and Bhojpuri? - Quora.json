            "answer_text": "Bhojpuri and awadhi are almost same. Actually awadhi is like the lighter bhojpuri. So anyone who speaks Bhojpuri in a Bollywood movie they keep it in a lighter note to make it understandable to audience. So lighter Bhojpuri used in Bollywood makes the awadhi speaking peoples think that it is their awadhi, which is their wrong perception. Both languages comes from common magadhi Prakrit. The difference between them can only be identified by flavor of the language. Awadhi has a very sweet flavor but bhojpuri pronunciation makes it very spicy/ chatak flavor. That's why bhojpuri is very popular throughout and awadhi is something people dosent even know about.Main awadhi speaking areas are faizabad and lukhnow. Going further down, the language changes and absorbs the flavors of Bhojpuri. Area surrounding Allahabad, Pratapgarh is officially awadhi but it is totally different from lukhnow version. Here awadhi is totally bhojpurinized. Amitabh bachhan speaks this language which is officially and unofficially different than each other in spirit. How can a actor became so popular by speaking a language which is not even known by many.Mostly Bollywood uses the lingua franca of region which starts from Allahabad to Banaras. It is region where both dialects mix up. Here language is very salty, unlike lukhnowi awadhi which is very very sweet.Aamir khan has himself said he speaks Bhojpuri in PK. language of amir khan was very chatak in its OK. Aamir khan's mother is from Banaras so he is already in touch with Bhojpuri since childhood.Bollywood never uses hardcore same language for the simple fact that everyone else can understand. Punjabi of Bollywood is a lighter Punjabi which we can understand. Same is the case with Marathi, Gujrati, Rajasthani in Bollywood. When it comes to Bhojpuri, the lighter version easily qualifies to be called as awadhi. In other languages lighter version dosent become some other launguage but in case of launguage of eastern UP it does because of common shared history of the mighty kingdom of Magadh. That's why dressing, food, eating paan and other tobaccos is common throughout UP and bihar",

            "answer_text": "Awadhi is a dialect of Hindi and hence not to be confused with Bhojpuri which is a complete language. Also Awadhi is not a lighter version of Bhojpuri since it is much older than Bhojpuri dating back to the times of Khosla Kingdom when Lord Ram used to rule Awadh through his capital Ayodhya. Valmiki has described about Awadhi and used many words of Awadhi while writing Ramayana. Its clearly mentioned by him that areas near Saryu river bank use this dialect. Then came Tulsidas who wrote his version of Ramayana completely in Awadhi. Even most of chaupai\u2019s are in Awadhi and Sanskrit which gives a clear idea how old this language is. Coming to your question why people mix it up is due to the strong influence of Bhojpuri film industry since movies have a wider appeal than folk and literature. While Awadhi does not have any of its own film industry but is still popular through folk & classical (dadra & thumri) songs and literature. Even Awadhi has a very strong hold on folk & classical song and literature than Bhojpuri. Bhojpuri film industry which was meant to promote bhojpuri has instead degraded its value being referred to as soft porn industry while Awadhi has still maintained its legacy and thats why it is still being used in Bollywood movies. Also due to influence of Bhojpuri Film industry most of the people have got this perception that Bhojpuri is spoken through out U.P. which is wrong as there are 6 (Awadhi, Braj,Khadi Boli,Bundeli,Bhojpuri,Bagheli) different languages which are spoken through out different parts of U.P., just like telgu,malayalam, kannada looks similar but they are not.
