            "answer_text": "In my opinion, she is good at it! She may not be as good as others in the industry but there is a reason why YG chose her to be lead rapper It\u2019s because she can rap Opposition 1) : Her lyrics are cringey My take on this: Her lyrics\u2014 see, it\u2019s not written by her. It\u2019s written by YG songwriter and how is that her fault? Opposition 2) : There are many other talented rappers like RM and Moonbyul My take on this: Why are you comparing her to RM, from BTS? Boy group raps and girl group ones are different so don\u2019t compare! Moonbyul is a talented rapper\u2014 yes that\u2019s true. She had been in this industry longer by 2 years. And yea before you say 2 years is a short period, it may be but this question asks if Lisa is good at rapping and did not ask to compare with others. How can any person not from the music industry or aspiring to be one judge like that? At least she has the rhythm and good pronounciation of an another language. She may be not as talented as other idols at rapping but she has the skills unlike a non rapping person. In that perspective of a bad rapper(me), I think she\u2019s good. In short: She is good, but not as talented Feel free to disagree with me ya! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not going to compare her to the other rappers out there (\u2018coz I don\u2019t think it will help) but more on pointing out some technical stuff. We also need to take into consideration that we didn\u2019t know if the lyrics were from her or other composers so we\u2019ll eliminate the song writing factor. Flow - She has a good flow on their songs however, when it\u2019s live, there are times that she\u2019ll miss a beat or suddenly increase the volume and thus make her became out of the flow. (LOL) Style - Her style is a slow word play with emphasis on each specific words. She pronounce some words differently which added some colors. Rapper doesn\u2019t mean you need to be fast. There are different styles out there and it will depend on how they\u2019ll be delivered. Delivery - Is the combination of all and for me it sounds good on their songs. It doesn\u2019t sound forced. She always put her style on it and no wonder why she\u2019s a fan of Nicki Minaj. Personally, I think her rapping style appeal so much to those who are more on the western music side. But her doing this is quite understandable since most of her music influences are western artists. (and their producer is also highly influenced by western music) Thanks! ",
