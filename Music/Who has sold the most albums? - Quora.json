            "answer_text": "One more time, as soon as records sales are requested we see the same fanciful claims going on like \u201cThriller sold 110 million copies\u201d. That is deeply wrong. No album ever came close to this number. Nor have albums like Back In Black, Bat Out Of Hell or Millennium sold 40 million plus. Wikipedia lists barely put together these wild claims so they are hardly helpful. These are the top 10 best selling studio albums in pure sales: 1. 1982 \u2013 Michael Jackson \u2013 Thriller \u2013 65,800,000 2. 1973 \u2013 Pink Floyd \u2013 The Dark Side of the Moon \u2013 43,300,000 3. 1992 \u2013 Whitney Houston \u2013 The Bodyguard \u2013 41,100,000 4. 1978 \u2013 Various Artists \u2013 Grease \u2013 38,100,000 5. 1971 \u2013 Led Zeppelin \u2013 Led Zeppelin IV \u2013 36,800,000 6. 1980 \u2013 AC/DC \u2013 Back in Black \u2013 35,810,000 7. 1977 \u2013 Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumours \u2013 35,500,000 8. 1977 \u2013 Bee Gees & Various Artists \u2013 Saturday Night Fever \u2013 34,800,000 9. 1987 \u2013 Michael Jackson \u2013 Bad \u2013 33,600,000 10. 1995 \u2013 Alanis Morissette \u2013 Jagged Little Pill \u2013 33,570,000 Full top 100 available here at Chartmasters. As someone who has been studying the music industry for more than 15 years, I have to point out that pure sales of original albums are not as meaningful as people tend to believe. The perception of success of top selling albums is often inflated as they went so high thanks to the absence of a competing compilation. For example, Queen\u2019s A Night At The Opera would be undoubtedly much closer to sales of the likes Led Zeppelin I, Metallica\u2019s black album or Pink Floyd\u2019s Wish you Were Here if it wasn\u2019t for the release of their 1981 Greatest Hits that truncated its legs. Then, the real question is about the \u201cmost successful\u201d album rather than \u201ctop album seller\u201d. At Chartmasters.org, we built the CSPC, Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept, to account for that. All big selling albums have been studied. The concept goes into every record from a catalog, weight all formats on par with albums and sum everything. The most successful British bands are listed below, the date is the date of the last audit. The top 10 then shows as listed below: 1. 1982 \u2013 Michael Jackson \u2013 Thriller \u2013 116,732,000 2. 1976 \u2013 Eagles \u2013 Hotel California \u2013 70,575,000 3. 1977 \u2013 Bee Gees & Various Artists \u2013 Saturday Night Fever \u2013 67,150,000 4. 1987 \u2013 Michael Jackson \u2013 Bad \u2013 62,899,000 5. 1977 \u2013 Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumours \u2013 61,258,000 6. 1980 \u2013 AC/DC \u2013 Back in Black \u2013 58,224,000 7. 1971 \u2013 Led Zeppelin \u2013 Led Zeppelin IV \u2013 57,016,000 8. 1973 \u2013 Pink Floyd \u2013 The Dark Side of the Moon \u2013 55,796,000 9. 1992 \u2013 Whitney Houston \u2013 The Bodyguard \u2013 53,744,000 10. 1991 \u2013 Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind \u2013 52,930,000 Full top 100 available here.
