            "answer_text": "If you have never invested before, it\u2019s normal to have tons of questions, and to feel overwhelmed with all the information that\u2019s out there. So if that describes how you feel right now, then\u2026 Here\u2019s a small blueprint of on how I recommend you start investing as a beginner: Start by paying off any high interest debt you might have: Earning 9% on the stock market, will not do you any good if you have any outstanding high interest debt. If the interest on your debt is higher than returns you're likely to earn by investing, you are better off paying that debt before you start to think about investing.Have an emergency fund: Once you pay off your high interest debt, you need to start working on building your emergency fund. Because as soon as you start investing your money, that money won\u2019t be as easy for you to access, as money sitting in a savings account. If you have money invested in a retirement account you might have to pay a fee to withdraw your money and depending on the type of account that you have, you might even have to pay taxes on the amount you decide to withdraw. So you are better off by having an emergency fund in place before starting to invest. That way if something unexpected happens, like you getting laid off from work you have money ready to cover your living expenses for a while, without having to touch your investment accounts. I recommend that you have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved in your emergency fund.Take advantage of your employer 401(K), especially if they offer matching your contribution: If your employer offers a matching contribution, I want you to start investing with their 401(k) plan. A 401K Is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows you to save and invest for your retirement on a tax deferred basis. I recommend that you contribute up to the amount to get the full employer\u2019s match, because it\u2019s literally free money that you\u2019ll be getting. If your employer will match up to 6 percent of your salary, make sure to redirect at least 6 percent of your paycheck to the 401(k) plan.Open an ROTH IRA Account: A Roth IRA , is like a Roth 401(k), but you don\u2019t need to have it sponsored by an employer to have one. Any individual can set up one by calling their preferred financial institution. There are two big advantages of these after-tax contributions: First, the money you invest in your Roth IRA grows tax-free. Second, you won\u2019t owe ANY taxes when you withdraw your money in retirement.Open a Brokerage Account and Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds (think long-term): If you are already maxing out your 401K and IRA accounts, then it\u2019s time to invest your money through a brokerage account. So where do you start? Well, you need to find a brokerage account that fits your needs. My favorite ones out there are: TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, E*TRADE, Charles Schwab, and Robinhood. I focus on investing on low-cost index funds that emulate the market and I invest for the long term because long-term capital gains tax rates are significantly lower than short-term capital gains tax rates, which means that I get to keep way more money in my pocket. And I don\u2019t know about you, but that makes me happy :)I cover all of these topics in depth in a video that I published a few days ago.

            "answer_text": "I would probably start by searching and understanding these things, if you want to do it yourself: Compound interestKnow what compound interest is and how it works. Albert Einstein called it the eight wonder of the world\u201d, and if you dont know exactly why he did that, i would start there. Because this is such a key thing in investing.Asset allocation Always spread your risk on different assets, companies, markets and instruments. There is risks involved in investing, and the best way to limit your risk is by allocating your assets the right way.All weather portofolio and portfolio managementWhen we talk about investing and asset allocation, you could also gain a lot of knowledge by understanding how an \u201cAll Weather portfolio\u201d works.Stocks/bonds or Index fundsKnow the key metrics of index funds, stocks and bonds before you start investing your money. For most new investors index funds would be preferable, because you by buying one index fund can spread your risk on 1000 of stocks and different sectors. If you would like to invest in stocks and bonds instead, look further below here for my thought on that.Investing in the Stockmarket: First of all you should start by gaining and gathering some knowledge about the stock market. If you are serious about investing and allocating your money the right way, you should start by getting to know the risks involved in investing in the stock market. After that, i would recommend you to try to develop a strategy for your investing approach. It can be difficult in the beginning, but here I can give you a few points to consider when stating out creating a strategy. You should know exactly how the company makes money, and what their market is. If you cannot define how they operate, how should you be able to see if it could be a great investment, and if the company is better than their competitors? After you have figured out how the company works, and what their place is in the market, you can begin to go through the company more directly. I often look at: Debt (Is the company in great debt, or do they have low to non debt)Managers and Board of directors (Who are they, and why are they worth to invest in)Finanacials (Are they making money, are they investing in the company, are they growing or declining)Competitors (Why should you invest in THIS company and not their competitorsFuture possibilities for the company (Can you see them operate in 5 year? Do they have a product that would be needed in 3\u20135 years or are they going to be run over by competitors)Valuation (Is it actually worth investing in the company or are they valued too high)The market psychology (Are investors taking money out of the market, or putting money in the market)The economic conditions of the market (timing the market can be very difficult, but you want to have an idea about the conditions you are investing in and the risks that follow)Your investment approach (Are you investing in the company to get a dividend each year, are you investing because of the undervaluation or are you investing because of the future growth)Does the company fit in your portfolio (Are you looking at a Biotech company and you portfolio is already filled with biotech, maybe you should consider allocating over different sectors)Do you have any knowledge about the sector (Do you have an edge in the sector, that will help you create better results and better decisions.)What you usually look at before investing is different from investor to investor. Personally I look more at the future, and try to see if the company has a innovative product that would be great in the future. Others see more at the financials and valuations. So you should define for yourself first, what your strategy is. A few key things that can help you in your future as an investor: Save each monthPut a side some of your income each month for investing. When the market declines you want to have money on the side that you can use to buy more of the good companies or funds. When saving some of your income each month you make sure, that you will never run out of cash, and it helps your investments grow in the long run.Fees and hidden feesKnow that when you invest you are paying fees in order to buy stocks, bonds or index funds. And if you use index funds, you are also paying a yearly fee. Compound interest can work for you or against you. And if you dont know which fees you are paying, you could end up having compound interest working against you and taking too much of your profit each year.Personally I hate paying more for something that is not greater. I use 3\u20134 different brokers to invest from because they all offer low fees on different products and different markets. I am always comparing index funds to find the best performing, with the lowest fees, and making sure that they are not more expensive then their competitors. I do not mind paying more if I get a greater product, but often this isn't the case. So make sure you know the price!
