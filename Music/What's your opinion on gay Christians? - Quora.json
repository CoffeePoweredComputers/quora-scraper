            "answer_text": "That they are sinners saved by the grace of God, who I will spend eternity with. That\u2019s also what I think of non-gay Christians, by the way. While I personally cannot justify having homosexual sex, I understand that many other Christians disagree with my interpretation of the relevant passages. I respect them, and their theological independence. In fact, for their sakes, I hope they are right. But ultimately, a gay Christian is still a Christian. That means they are a sinner who my God loves so much, he sent himself to be Yeshua of Nazereth, and to die on the cross. There my God took upon Himself the penalty for their sins, as he did for mine. As he did for yours. Christians are simply those who turn to Christ in faith and repentance, and who strive to follow his teachings and to serve Him, and God through Him, and do so by serving their fellow man.  Some notes: I\u2019ve heard reasonable arguments for homosexual Christian marriage. I disagree with them, but I\u2019ve heard them and respect that others hold to them. There is no argument for having sex outside of marriage, with anyone, at any time. This is the standard for all Christians. Many, if not most, breach this prohibition at some point in their lives. This is unfortunate, but understood. If we repent He is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Frankly, I have a much bigger problem with Christians - gay or straight or what have you - who sleep around than I do with married gay couples. Jesus Christ never once condemned someone for homosexuality. Not even for adultery - although he absolutely and famously told the adulteress \u201cgo and sin no more\u201d. Jesus Christ never failed to condemn hypocrisy when he saw it, and to condemn the teachers of hypocrisy and the purveyors of hypocrisy. If you are against married gay Christians, but turn a blind eye to Christians who sleep around? You are a hypocrite. And it is time for you to repent. ",

            "answer_text": "That doesn\u2019t really make sense. A gay Christian is not really a true, faithful christian. According to the bible, they would be sinning and not listening to God. So it would just be what is my opinion on Gays. Which is probably obvious. You can\u2019t be gay and a real, true, God following Christian. 1 Timothy 1:8\u201311 \u201c8 We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. 9 We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 10 for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers\u2014and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine 11 that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.\u201d Leviticus 18:22 \u201cDo not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable\u201d Leviticus 20:13 \u201cIf a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\u201d Hebrews 13:4\u20135 \u201cMarriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\u201d\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:9\u201311 \u201cOr do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\u201d And there are many more verses about homosexuality and sexual purity. Those who have truly accepted Christ and follow the truth of the bible are free from the punishment of sin. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. Which one sounds better? EDIT: I was wrong, please see the comments to see my explanation of what I now believe. I will not delete this answer, but please know that I now see my errors, I now see how what I said was wrong. God is love. I did not mean to be hateful, but it appears I was. The state of being homosexual is not sinful, only the practice of it. Acting upon temptation is what we call sin. Experiencing temptation is not sinful. I apologize to anyone who I may have offended. I did not provide a sound representation of the God I cling to, so please do not leave here thinking the answer above this edit is a representation of God himself and Christians everywhere, I was wrong. Forgive me for misleading you and God forgive me for my past unsound opinion. ",
