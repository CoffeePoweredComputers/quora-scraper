            "answer_text": "Question: Why do people like Eminem? In an era where most rappers were focusing on being \u201cgangsta\u201d or making club hits, Eminem did neither. 1.) He opened up his personal, intimate life with the entire world. He shared openly about his dysfunctional family - the relationship between his mom and him between him and his absentee father and between him and his estranged wife. Pretty much unheard of for a rapper who by definition is supposed to be macho all the time, talk about all the bitches they have sex with, how much money they have, what kind of clothes they wear and the length, width, girth and density of their chains. This is an underappreciated aspect of Eminem\u2019s rise because he definitely went with this formula for quite some time - to the point where people probably are tired of it. Regardless, Eminem tapped into suburban and urban angst with his initial releases: I'm like a head trip to listen to'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friendsInside your living roomThe only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'allAnd I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at allThe Real Slim Shady, 2000 Opening up in this way allowed a lot of people, from all backgrounds, to relate to Eminem. And, yes, it helped that he was white and he admits this multiple times. 2.) Eminem is technically one of the best rappers ever. Period. Still, to this day, this is true and no one important in the rap industry would disagree. Does he pick bad beats sometimes? Yes. Does he rap with strange accents? Yes. Does he touch on disagreeable, gross or otherwise offensive topics? Yes. But, are his rhyme schemes, cadence, flow, delivery, timing and vocabularly absolutely off the charts good? Also, YES. The irony about people is that en masse they usually can recognize and appreciate talent, especially if it is over a long period of time or if they can decide between multiple options. At the same time, people might walk right on by the best violinist in the world if he/she was playing in the subway because they assume that person is not that important or any good (due to environment). Yet, if you expose millions of average and not-so-average people to the same genre of music for years, usually the ones that rise to the top are pretty good. This is true in both sports and music, in my opinion. Some may say mumble rap is an exception to this rule but I digress. This relates back to why people like Eminem because, let\u2019s be honest, people tend to like people who are good at a craft. To go a step further, people are willing to excuse heinous acts so long as you are very good at your craft. Take individual NFL player behavior for example. Murder someone, rape someone, beat your girlfriend or wife \u2192 that\u2019s fine so long as you catch very well or can tackle someone hard. Check. Take a knee to raise awareness that black men are targeted disproportionately by police officers and the justice system in this country, out of a job. Check. If Tiger Woods bounced back quicker professionally, his sponsors would have come back. No question. Our culture can excuse poor morals but we do not excuse poor performance. Not in the cards for some reason. Eminem has performed, literally, at a high level since 1998 (I would argue since 1996 when he released Infinite). The dude rapped circles around the entire industry for a 10 year period till the point where he named an album The Eminem Show\u2026. BECAUSE IT WAS. That album was amazing, by the way. 3.) Eminem is disrespectful. Let\u2019s call it what it is. He says stuff for shock value. He is the class clown rapper. He was bullied as a kid and now, or at least then, he bullied Hollywood and the whole idea of success or popdom. It was a joke to him. It still is. He did not get caught up in his own importance. If he didn\u2019t like you, it was \u201cfuck you\u201d. People think Em got political just recently with his Trump freestyle but that is not the case. Listen to \u201cWe as Americans\u201d or \u201cMosh\u201d or \u201cWhite America\u201d. He sent more overt shots to President Bush than Drake takes at most current rappers. For his remarks: Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidentsI'd rather see the president deadIt's never been said, but I set precedents Eminem got investigated and targeted by the Secret Service for this. And it\u2019s not that Eminem is some political junkie or the next Talib Kweli \u201cwoke\u201d type of rapper. I just think he saw these talking heads a lot on TV and despised them so he took shots. Just Em being Em. All of this disrespect and honesty was refreshing for the majority of people/kids listening. Eminem made it cool to be counter-cultural while at the same time being a huge cultural figure. These days, it seems kind of uncool to like Eminem because of one too many songs with Rihanna or Ed Sheeran but back in the day (dare I say) Eminem was a badass and it felt damn good to recite the lyrics to \u201cJust Don\u2019t Give a Fuck\u201d or the aptly named \u201cStill Don\u2019t Give a Fuck\u201d. It was an emotional, almost spiritual, outlet to let loose and stop caring about what other people thought. Eminem was probably the first \u201cdo you\u201d rapper before do you was a thing.  (If you don\u2019t like this answer, then fuck you, cuz I STILL DON\u2019T GIVE A FUCK) lol ",

            "answer_text": "EMINEM- that\u2019s a big name in the hip-hop industry. Now let me show you why he is so popular.  Eminem knows how to sell music. He knows how to move records. The marshall Mathers LP sold 1.76 million copies,making it the fastest selling hip-hop album in history. Ten of his albums have hit no.1 in the billiboard 100.Eminem\u2019s extremely tight lyricism won him accolades among the hardcore fans of hip-hop. The speed at which he rattles off syllables, impresses everyone . Whoever has heard Rap god , i\u2019m sure he is awestruck by Em\u2019s speed.He came up with dr.dre. A member of NWA , Dre went on to work with snoop dog, Kendrick Lamar and Eminem. He discovers geniuses and works with geniuses. He picked EMINEM , -and it paid off dividends. He was \u201cthe white rapper\u201d. Em\u2019s race has been both a blessing and a curse for him. As a white guy , he had to prove a lot before rap culture could fully embrace him. He had a unique position as the only mainstream white rapper who was a top-tier lyricist , which helped him to spread hip-hop to the whiter audience.Eminem\u2019s Storytelling. Everyone knows about Em\u2019s personal struggles. He had several classic songs like stan , which have become legendary songs for telling a emotional narrative across his verses- getting into the head of an insane fan and telling his story through the music. He has also other songs like Not Afraid. He aired out family grievances. We all know about Eminem\u2019s teisted verses, speaking about his mother. But a lot of people found catharsis in taking out their anger against their families through Em\u2019s music. He became the voice of the angry , rebellious youth. He played the villain in his own song. In his songs like Without me, Em fully understood his place within the pop culture- he made things interesting. He was violent,aggressive and crude. He became the anti PC voice of George Carlin, resurrected in rap, an anti hero, a villain , a symbol of rebellion in rap music. He was always political. Songs like white america called out his own fanbase, and eminem was dissing George.W.Bush long before Donald trump thought of entering the oval office. And yet, many conservatives still loved him, he was able to manage his fanbase expertly.He captured the emotions of his fans. From playing the villain to telling stories in music amounts to one thing- EMOTIONAL IDENTIFICATION. White kids, Black kids, women and even all adults understood the emotion and outrage of eminem. Capturing the emotion took him to the top. Every other rappers like him. (not talking about MGK). From Kendrick Lamar to Nicki Minaj everyone said that em was a huge influence in their music. 8 Mile- casting himself as B.Rabbit. Eminem\u2019s movie about a young rapper trying to make it in the detroit battle rap scene has a become a piece of the classic pop culture cinema. It\u2019s remarkable that he himself played B.Rabbit. Last but not the least. He is hungry for more. At this age of 46 years, he is still making albums, dissed MGK, and so on . Above all, Eminem is my idol - because of whom i never gave up in life. His rage and honesty are the best things which I admire. For no matter what,HE IS THE GREATEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  have a great day ahead\u2026 THANKS FOR READING\u2026 ",
