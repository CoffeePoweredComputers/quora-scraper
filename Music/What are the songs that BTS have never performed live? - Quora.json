            "answer_text": "[EDIT : i\u2019ve done more research & i\u2019ve been seeing the comments, so i need to update this] Uuuhhhh this is very tricky to answer, but i\u2019ll try my best\u2026 and i\u2019m not quite sure abt my answers either. I have to say (espcially since it wasn\u2019t specified since when so imma assume its from their debut days), its very hard, knowing they have so many songs\u2026 But imma try giving answers.. Most of the songs they didn\u2019t performed live is usually the unpopular version of the original song, or either its the hidden track of the album (usually is the case but not always too). It can also be that the song didn\u2019t match the \u2018setting\u2019 of the concert or live so it wasn\u2019t performed. Most lives performance are based of the single (of the album) or it is of the concept of the live. I will list accordingly to their song list (based by year & the lives i had watched & seen the concert song setlist) : 2013 (O!RUL8,2? era) Intro : O!RUL8,2?(Back in 2013, BTS does a lot of street performances rather than concerts, so even they performed, its just their hit single of the album) Moving to 2014, BTS started & finally are doing concerts in halls rather than their usual gigs (street performance) back in 2013. They are getting more exposure so from this year on, its harder to know which songs are not performed, but also partially easier since they have more songs. 2014 (Dark & Wild era) Would You Turn Off Your Cellphone?Outro: Does That Make Sense?2015 (Most Beautiful Moment in Life pt.1 & pt.2 era) Intro : Blooming Youth2016 (Most Beautiful Moment in Life : Young Forever era) is tbh the fuller version previous albums, like if they were put in to one. The concert / live tracklist are the same so nothing change, so the songs not performed are a combination of the 2 albums above. Now\u2026, from this year is very tricky to find the songs they never performed live since they now have concerts & lives everywhere & since entering the album You Never Walk Alone (2017) they put all songs from the album to the concert tracklists\u2026 2017 (Love Yourself : Tear) Paradise - actually a hidden tracklist2017 (Love Yourself : Her) Sea - hidden tracklist (this one is omg amazing pls listen to this)2018 (Face Yourself japanese album) Outro : CrackAnd for 2019\u2019s Map of the Soul : Persona, since they are currently on live tour, its not yet known the concert tracklist :) For the solo songs that never performed live, there are quite the long list\u2026 especially the rap line\u2026 RM\u2019s mixtape Mono (2018) TokyoSeoulMoonchildBadbyeUhgoodEverythingoesForever RainSuga \u2018August D\u2019 mixtape Agust D (2016) August DGive it to me724148140503 at dawnThe LastIn this mixtape, only Tony Montana (Suga ft. Jimin) & So Far Away (sang by Jin, V, Jungkook & Jimin, originally it was Suga & Suran) was ever performed live. JHope\u2019s mixtape Hope World ( DaydreamP.O.P (Pieces of Peace)HangsangAirplane pt.1Hope WorldBase LineOutro : BluesideFor the vocal line, their solo songs are always in the concert tracklists..
