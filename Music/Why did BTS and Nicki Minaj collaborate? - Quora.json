            "answer_text": "Today, Nicki Minaj's fans collectively helped BTS's new single, \"Dynamite,\" to hit the charts, where they all purchase a real order. Tomorrow, BTS fan club will help Nicki Minaj's new single \"Expensive\" to hit the charts, similarly placing orders. This way, the two fan clubs are linked, and the strongest of the strong purchasing power is used to achieve a stable throne, where both received good results. It's a win-win. However, with the deadline for the rankings/billboard not yet finalized, the Nicki Minaj fan club has proposed an additional condition. The condition states that BTS fans must help Nicki Minaj fans to increase the views for \"Anaconda\" on YouTube after meeting the other requirements. BTS ARMY has to help \"Anaconda\" reach 1 billion views, where the current number is 950 million, meaning that BTS fans need to contribute 50 million YouTube clicks to Nicki Minaj. For such conditions, BTS fans were very accepting. Many Korean fans said that the Nicki Minaj fan club had found the right fan club. This is what they do best and also stating that the 50 million views 100 percent will be completed on time. Today, both fan clubs have called on their fans to start buying BTS's new single \"Dynamite\" and pre-ordering Nicki Minaj's new single \"Expensive.\" They also encouraged fans who already bought the albums from participating in the listing(for billboard championship), using hashtag #BARBZXARMYPOWER to show their contribution. There is much controversy about such behavior. Some people will doubt how genuine this single album championship will be? Will this counted as cheating? But I think these events are all just \"passing by.\" As time goes on, people will no longer remember how this championship single came from years later. They will only remember that \"Dynamite\" is the first Korean single album championship in the history of Billboard. After all, people are like this many times, only looking at the results but not the process. I think, whether you like BTS or not, you cannot deny it that they are making history. And as long as Billboard does not say that the BTS fan club is cheating, there will be no cheating. Because all the rules, ranking, and championship are all officially made and determined by Billboard, no matter what method is used, as long as the results/outcomes are not invalidated, they are all compliant and legal in the rules to hit the list. As long as the title of the single is on board, no one can say that it is unworthy. If you want to scold or judge, you can only blame Billboard as an institution that is no longer the same and has flawed rules. So will the next champion single be \"Priceless Sister\"? ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure, why, but they might of liked her style of music. Now I have a different outlook on music the her style, for example, I love Baby got Back, but was not impressed with her Anaconda. But that's my opinion. The collaboration with BTS the beginning was alright, but her verse it just really didn't fit right. It was two different styles slapped together. But that is just my opinion, I adore BTS, but I don't have to like everything they do. That is one version I refuse to listen to, I just st don't like it at all. Sorry ",
