This is basically what happened\u2026Army's being the strongest Fandom out there decided his Remix of Savage love with BTS has to be rewarded and given huge props and by the amount of Downloads from us we topped up the charts for that rmx and got No1 on Billboard , but then it changed to Jason's original song not the Remix, I honestly don't know why it changed and I'm a bit confused like.. A lot of Army's call out Jason for being greedy and a freaking snitch.. Basically thinking he's all responsible for this sht  And don't forget.. Army's knew what they have to do about this.. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9c I now get it why Army's are coming for Derulos freaking soul XD \ud83d\ude02  He's spotted not giving any credits to BTS at all or even mentioning them at all or even speaking about them and the collab  His Btch ass even had the audacity to celebrate it with buying random people drinks.. What a freakish Moran  But honestly I wonder myself, cause Jason might not even been involved with Billboard to be responsible for the song version change on the charts, but seriously, seems like Billboard give props to the original artists making me question their true intentions.. And Army's know far well that literally huge amounts of people just don't wanna get any props to Asian Artists and so more less hugely successful groups such as BTS with the biggest Impact Worldwide right now like.. Is Billboard being shady? Like. Umm.. Get your mf asS straight.. I might run ya over btxh  BTS themselves couldn't give more CrAp about it honestly.. They already own the world by now..  ",

            "answer_text": "Per Billboard: Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo's \"Savage Love (Laxed \u2013 Siren Beat)\" falls to No. 1 a week after it surged from No. 8 to No. 1 aided by two new BTS remixes. (With activity for the BTS versions not outperforming those by Jawsh 685/Derulo in the latest tracking week, BTS is now not listed as a billed act on the song on either global chart; for historical purposes, all three acts retain credit for the song's week at No. 1 on the Global 200.) BTS' 'Dynamite' Dominates Billboard Global Charts, Fleetwood Mac's 'Dreams' Thunders to Top 10 BTS gets credited for the Hot 100 #1. Army stopped streaming it as hard the second week, so the sales of the remix does not outperform the original. I anticipate Army boost to be completely gone for the upcoming tracking week now that Jason completely disrespected BTS and Army. ",
