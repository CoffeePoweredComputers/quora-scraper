            "answer_text": "Not too much. My ex is Hakka and her parents are also Hakka. The Hakka dialect that her hometown speaks (in Renhua County, near Shaoguan), is different from the dialect her parents speak. Matter of fact, her parents come from different villages, and their villages speak different dialects from each other. Her mom speaks her village speak, her dad speaks his village speak, and she understands both, but speaks the hometown one. Most people in her hometown can understand her parents\u2019 speak, but when they go to Shaoguan they speak a \u201cmore standard\u201d Hakka dialect, than their village speak. When they go to Guangzhou and speak Hakka, people won\u2019t understand them, unless they are Hakka, too. Chiuchow people who speak Cantonese but never learned Hakka (or never spent time around Hakka people) probably won\u2019t understand Hakka. Once upon a time she was answering a call from her mom and I was standing next to her. She was giving her mom the new phone number of her cousin and she was speaking the numbers one by one. I know how to count in Cantonese and didn\u2019t understand jack shit, until she told me what she was doing.  Long, long time ago, I had a lecture about Chinese languages by a very respected linguist back home. He was of the opinion (that was in early 2000s), that when talking about languages in China, and the ability of speakers of said languages to communicate with each other, it is actually more correct to say that there are over 6,000 languages, most of which come with dozens of local dialects. For him, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hakka or Chiuchow should actually be considered separate languages, rather than just dialects of \u201cChinese,\u201d because if one considered Hakka or Cantonese a \u201cdialect,\u201d one should also consider Polish and Russian dialects - that\u2019s how far these languages are from each other.
