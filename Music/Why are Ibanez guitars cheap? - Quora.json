            "answer_text": "I think the premise of this question is false. Like Fender, and the other large makers, Ibanez offers a fairly wide range of guitars at different price points. Some are cheap. . .some are not. Ibanez Gio costs as little as $150, but this is by design an inexpensive entry level guitar. BTW, don\u2019t let the price tag fool you. . these are good instruments. At the other end of the spectrum, Ibanez J custom series costs $3000 each. Ibanez Path Metheny and George Benson jazz guitar models cost $3600. I think, quality-wise, these stand up to similar offerings by other companies (including US based ones beginning with the letter \u201cG\u201d). The Joe Satriani chrome solid body costs $5000. You can argue whether or not its worth that price, but for a solid body electric guitar that\u2019s not \u201ccheap\u201d in my book! George Benson GB10  ",

            "answer_text": "Ibanez has inexpensive guitars as well as expensive guitars- just like Fender and Gibson/ Epiphone, they try to market their products to every price point that they can. Ironically, when Ibanez guitars got started, they made copies of Fender and Gibson guitars at tremendously lower prices. Fender realized this and started marketing Asian made instruments at a price to compete with Ibanez,so, you could buy a Strat that said Fender on the headstock, or, you could buy a Strat that said Ibanez on the headstock- most people chose Fender. Gibson countered Ibanez with the Epiphone brand making it well known that Epiphone came from Gibson. Ibanez sales suffered at this point. This is when they started to make some of their own designs, closely resembling Fender and Gibson in many ways, but,with their own interpretations on these instruments. ",
