            "answer_text": "Acoustic version will replace the electric guitar with an acoustic. It will also use an acoustic drum set rather than electric. It will use an acoustic piano. There will be fewer effects on the vocals. The idea is to convey the feeling of an informal performance in someone's living room. The biggest audible difference is the use of acoustic guitar. The use of an electro-acoustic guitar in traditional shape is acceptable since the pickup's role is to only make the sound engineer's life easier without modifying the sound. This is mostly applicable to live performances. There are countless tricks to produce an \u201cacoustic\u201d track in the recording studio using computers and sample libraries. Prohibited instruments - electric guitar, synthesizers, guitar effects, electric drums. I do not know how they handled bass. Other answers suggest the bass stays electric. Bass effects get turned off. MTV had a show called MTV Unplugged that it's a great demonstration of how that format should work. MTV Unplugged - Wikipedia ",
