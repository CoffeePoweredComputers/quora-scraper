            "answer_text": "I\u2019d start by finding the intonation spot. If you\u2019re not sure it\u2019s the spot where the the 12th fret would be. Exclusively on the fret bar just above it. If you do a natural harmonic (by which I mean touching the string lightly whilst picking) you will achieve this. these are all over the neck but touch where the fret bar above the 12th fret would be if it were there. Might take a couple of attempts whilst moving your fretting hand position slightly to find it. It will ring out as an E (if done on E string of course in the right spot). Once you have found that, mark it maybe with a dot on the side of the fret board. These dots are usually there so it\u2019s odd to hear of a fretless that doesn\u2019t. The next step would be doing the same process with the 5th fret which should ring out as an octave higher than the 12th fret. The same goes for 17th fret as also an E. The next step I would do is find the dominant note. On the E string this would be a B which would be the 7th and 19th fret. This should be a sufficient amount of reference when playing but if you require more visible notes, the jargon is as follows: 3.5 fret-same as 7th or 19th 4th fret-same as fretted note 5th fret-same as open or 12th 7th fret-same as 3.5 or 19 9th fret-same as 4th or 16th 12th fret-same as open, 5th or fretted note that should be enough jargon but that should enable you to find the conventional markers of 3,5,7,9,12 and so on. Little bit of permanent marker should do. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have a traditional unlined fretless and have dots on the odd frets, you can put small pieces of tape where the other fret dots would be. You should measure carefully for the lower frets - it\u2019s not halfway between! For the higher frets the difference will be smaller. Even then, you need to be aware of the optical effect called \u201cparalax\u201d - when you look at things from an angle perspectives can be messed up. That\u2019s almost all of us decent fretless players will stress it\u2019s your EARS that really tell you where you go. Among some of the best ear exercises are playing the same note or interval on all the strings (or different strings - some notes don\u2019t happen on all the strings). Also PLAY YOUR SCALES IN POSITIONS USING OPEN STRINGS. The open strings are your anchors - utilize them as much as possible to keep your intonation correct. ",
