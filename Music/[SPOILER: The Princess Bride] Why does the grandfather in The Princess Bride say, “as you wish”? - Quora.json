            "answer_text": "Throughout The Princess Bride, \u201cAs you wish\u201d is meant as a promise of true love and eternal devotion. From Westley to Buttercup, it is used instead of \u201cI love you\u201d, at first as a witty answer to Buttercup\u2019s snobbish behaviour, then as a promise, finally as a reminder of promises kept. The Grandfather is entertaining his sick grandson by reading him the book. He promises to come back the next day to read it all over again. The \u201cAs you wish\u201d is a promise of return, of devotion, of true love, that not even Death can stop. Plus a nice reference to the story they just shared. ",
