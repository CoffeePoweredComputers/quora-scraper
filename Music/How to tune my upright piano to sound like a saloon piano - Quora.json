There are likely lots of places (for instance, churches that are closing, and that have been around for a number of decades) that have partially decrepit, out-of-tune pianos hanging around in storage rooms, classrooms that are no longer used, etc. ,that they\u2019d love to get rid of for next to nothing.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a natural process that takes time. Here\u2019s how you do it: Get the piano tuned properly, and then wait a few years. It will automatically take on that rich saloon piano sound, especially when you play saloon-style music. Then, be careful to avoid having the piano tuned, so you don\u2019t ruin it. ",
