            "answer_text": "I THINK its because Naruto dont fell in love with her at first sight and thats not bad at all is realistic. The first person to capture Naruto\u2019s interest was Sakura, and while he like Sakura he won\u2019t pay much attention to Hinata, he cant like both. And theres no problem with that they dont need to love or like each other from the beginning. Even with that he considered Hinata a friend and was aware of what she was capable of and of her abilities. They were friends, he go in missions with her, he rescued her few times and wbefore edevery relationship starts as friendship. Yes he didn\u2019t have any romantic interest in her during the first years but that doesn\u2019t mean he COULD develop them later on. But right when shippuden starts and he was looking for a team partner, they talk a little but well Hinata and her shyness. Her shyness prevent her for many momments with him. Until the pain arc that she confessed her love, he didn\u2019t said anything is true but the first thing he thought when finally beat Pain was about her safety, he was so so worried. Also broke a promise ( WE ALL KNOW WHAT A PROMISE MEAN TO NARUTO )realizing the nine tails power, merely transformed completely because of the thought hinata died. Dont mean anything romantic but we know that he cares a lot about her. People said he ignored her is true, but think meabe is because he dont even know that he need to tell her something, never in his whole life a girl confessed to him and he never has someone to explain him what that means. The fact he liked Sakura doesn\u2019t mean he knew what it means to be loved. Yes his mom explained to him but that was after the pain arc. Im not underestimate Naruto\u2019s intelligence but in the whole anime they show us that he is so so dumb hahahaha he really is so dumb. He mature with the time but he still was a dummy, is part of his personality. Wasn\u2019t completely his fault he never had persons who taught him about life and all that stuff. Even when he was little, he doubt about what was the sun. ( so cute ) They as friends FRIENDS have a decent and good relationship. But nothing will happen between them until he doesn\u2019t like Sakura anymore. When he cut the feeling he had for Sakura and accepted she only will love Sasuke, clear his mind and now he is open to love someone else. Now is Hinata\u2019s chance. After Sakura\u2019s fake confession Naruto doesn\u2019t feel anything for her anymore. He still love her but as a very precious friend, then Hinata and Naruto had few momments in the war arc. For example when Narutos saves her from the white zetsus and read Hinata\u2019s eyes, when UNFORTUNATELY NEJI DIED and then what we see in the movie: the Last. Yes they have a poorly development but their not forced or rushed ( also we don\u2019t know what happened between them the two years after the war ) :) Hope you like it and agree with me let me know your opinionsss ",

            "answer_text": "There are two answers here, one in-story and one out of story. The core of the in-story answer is that Naruto always acknowledged Hinata as a friend, but by the time Hinata makes herself known to Naruto as a potential romantic partner, he\u2019s got FAR bigger things on his mind than romance. When Hinata confesses to Naruto that she loves him, Pain immediately tosses her skyward, nearly killing her. Naruto loses control of the Kyuubi and goes berserk. By the time he regains control of his body, he\u2019s met his father and been filled with determination to both defeat Pain and to understand him and answer the question that\u2019s been asked. Once that\u2019s done, he\u2019s both elatedly being celebrated as a hero and doing his best to help rebuild the village. He\u2019s also still mourning the loss of Jiraiya on some levels, so there\u2019s a lot of heavy thoughts on his mind. Before things can calm down, Danzou becomes acting Hokage and starts throwing his weight around in Tsunade\u2019s absence. Then Cloud ninjas start showing up and harassing Team 7, and Naruto learns that Sasuke joined Akatsuki and supposedly has kidnapped the jinchuuriki of the 8 Tails. From that point on, he\u2019s worried sick about Sasuke, and trying to get the Cloud ninjas to drop their vendetta against him. Then he meets Tobi/Madara\u2026and war gets declared\u2026and then he faces Sasuke, and then he gets taken away to train with Bee, and he meets his mom, and\u2026and\u2026and\u2026. Things rapidly escalate in Naruto\u2019s life from then on until the war is done. Before her confession, Hinata was always a person Naruto admired and appreciated, but he was completely oblivious to the reasons for her shyness and embarrassment around him, and therefore he saw those behaviors as weird. To him, her faints, blushes and squeaks came out of nowhere, so he couldn\u2019t really get a read on it and shrugged it off as her own special strangeness. And it\u2019s understandable that he came to that conclusion that it\u2019s just her, given that she\u2019s also shy and quiet with everyone else, though it\u2019s never as strong with them as it is when he\u2019s around and smiling at her. After the confession, he might have been able to understand a lot of previous events in a new light, had he taken the time to focus and think back. But, by that point in the story, events were happening too quickly for him to really take the time to reflect on much beyond the current moment\u2019s trouble. Even when the war is done, Naruto is playing an active role in world affairs, studying to become a Jounin, and working his way toward being a Hokage. He just didn\u2019t slow down enough to even remotely examine his feelings or let hers really sink in. It\u2019s even possible that he forgot her confession in the midst of the hundreds of other things going on. The secondary answer is directly related: the story got too big to fit it in. Just as Naruto himself is sucked into events that are so large and world-threatening that he can\u2019t really take the time to think about her confession, Kishimoto found the need to keep the plot moving slowly squeezing any thoughts of a romance off the pages. He wanted to develop both Sakura and Hinata more thoroughly. He wanted them to be more involved. But in the end, he couldn\u2019t figure out a way to do it during the events of a war involving almost every person of legend in the ninja world. There was no time to sort things out and regroup for the main character, and in the last third of the series that\u2019s directly centered on world politics, war, and the Naruto-Sasuke rivalry, there was no time for him to develop the women\u2019s characters and friendships with Naruto the way he\u2019d desired to.
