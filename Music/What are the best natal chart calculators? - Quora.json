            "answer_text": "Ahh yes, the study of personal-astrology, the energy of the soul\u2026 my top three are as follows:  \u201cAstro Charts\u201d, the most beginner friendly calculator I\u2019ve come across. The platform is clean cut and easy to use. It also tells you some of the most stand-out patterns in your natal chart, however it is not the most detailed calculator.\u201cFree Astrology Reports\u201d, not as beginner friendly as \u201castro-charts\u201d; however, it gets the job done and it also gives you general interpretations of the planets/signs in your chart. However, some of the description can be quite vague or even misleading, so it\u2019s fine if you skip over them until you get better acquainted with your chart.\u201cHoroscope and Astrology - Homepage\u201d, this one is definitely not beginner friendly, the layout is quite confusing; however, I would still put it on my list of the top three chart-calculators because it is by far the most detailed and informative. From what I\u2019ve seen, you can find any planetary body or point in your natal-chart using this calculator, but learning how to do it is another story.All of these natal chart calculators are free, and all of them have their pros-and-cons. What I would recommend doing (for those who are curious) is using the most beginner friendly calculator first \u201cAstro Charts\u201d and doing some online research of the information listed in your chart. For example; if you have your \u201cVenus in the 12th house In the zodiac sign Cancer\u201d (I have this one); you can lookup articles and find YouTube videos on: Venus in the 12th houseVenus in CancerThe meaning of the 12th houseThe meaning of Venus (aka, Aphrodite) in astrology... the plethora of self-knowledge you can pull from your natal-chart will seem endless so take your time, and enjoy.
