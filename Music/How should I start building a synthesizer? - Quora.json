            "answer_text": "Easy! Buy one of my kits from AISynthesis.com. We offer easy to build kits with full video build guides (in addition to step by step picture guides). Right now we have mixer and multiple modules available, but Filters, LFOs, and Envelope Generators are in production now, and in the future we\u2019ll have a complete system. You don\u2019t have to buy all of our stuff though, once you build the multiple (which teaches soldering) and the mixer, you\u2019ll be ready to take on other DIY builds! In addition to offering kits, we also have full guides for getting started in DIY including lists of tools, and a step by step guide for buying your first items (like cases and power). ",

It would depend on if you want to build a plug-programmable modular synthesizer or something that is keyboard driven.  There are books (MATRIXSYNTH: Synth Books) and synthesizer kits available. (Thonk - DIY Synthesizer Kits & Components)  And, let's not forget our friends who use Google and YouTube -- where information is shared and free for the taking. ",
