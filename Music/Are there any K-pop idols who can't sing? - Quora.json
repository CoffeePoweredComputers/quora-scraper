            "answer_text": "Are there any K-pop idols who can't sing? GOOD GOD! In looking for some inspirational answers for this, all I could find was thirsty un-merged question after question crying about wanting to be an idol! Holy\u2026      Man, that hurt. I especially hate the ones where people desperately want in, while admitting to not having any talent. And worse? They'd probably get accepted. (breathe\u2026just breathe) Okay. Sorry. Let's just answer the question. Look\u2026all idols can sing. All that neck-breaking training doesn't just go to waste even on the least talented trainee. If you suck, you'll at least debut being able to carry a tune. I know wolves that can howl on key and they don't take singing lessons. Goddammit, unless you're just the world's biggest doofus, you'll eventually sing without making your voice teacher jump out a window. For lack of a better way of doing it, I'll break things up into descending levels using idols I know well. These are my personal estimations and feel free to disagree to your mom or some friends after school. Level 5: Twice Momo/SNSD Yoona Carries a good tune and doesn't sound terrible doing it. Level 4: Gfriend SinB/Blackpink Lisa More pleasant to the ear, but still nothing to rave about. Level 3: Red Velvet Seulgi/Blackpink Jennie Makes the ears wake up and take notice. Level 2: Gfriend Yuju/EXID Solji This is where you really start feeling impressed. Level 1: Mamamoo Solar/Red Velvet Wendy Mind blown. Notice the theme? Never do I say \u201ccan't sing for shit.\u201d Even at Level 5, they can sing. HOWEVER! Let's try singing and dancing at the same time. That's where the ship hits the iceberg. Singing and dancing is really hard. Let's repeat like Winner would say it: IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD. Not all idols can handle this. Some get downright embarrassed. I won't talk about them here. But I will talk about the stars. Here's an MR Removed video of Apink singing \u201c%%.\u201d Apink is one group that almost never sounds bad. They're not known for their backbreaking choreos, but watch Eunji at 0:42. She does a full twist in the air and a leg kick and her vocal doesn't shake even for half a second!  BTS Jungkook? He's a rock. Chungha? All by herself on the stage and usually keeps it smooth and steady. Some people are very good at singing and dancing at the same time. So\u2026the issue here is how people gauge an idol's ability by how well or how badly they do something that normal people aren't supposed to be able to do: sing AND dance. Eunji? Not normal. Jungkook? Superman. Chungha? She's in a different class than most. K-pop demands too much from their performers, plain and simple. Dazzling dances are great, but let's not end up having to overuse the backing tracks. And when idols end up exposing themselves as mere humans, then we say they can't sing. That's fucked up. Okay bye. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are. Some idols have debuted because they are amazing at dancing or rapping, or even because they are gorgeous. When it comes to the two first options, it doesn't matter at all. There are also some idols who can sing or just have nice voices, but they don't have a good technique. For example, I always talk about IZ*ONE. They all are pretty and can dance, but when it comes to singing, generally they can't. There are just 4 members who can sing (Yuri, Eunbi, Chaewon and Chaeyeon) and the others are in the group because of their visuals or dance skills (mostly the first one). It's not a hate comment, I'm just saying my opinion. However, not every group is like IZ*ONE. Let's talk about Blackpink; they all can sing, but they don't have a good technique. Rose strains her voice a lot and it sounds more nasal than it is. Jisoo is the most stable member, but she sounds more nasal too. Jennie has a nice voice, but she can't control it, and I think that it's because she doesn't breath well. And Lisa, she has a beautiful voice but she's mostly a dancer/rapper, so I understand why she hasn't been trained well. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. A lot of talented rappers are not that good at singing, or are not quite as good as their vocal counterparts. Though this seems to be dwindling as companies are forcing even rappers to be able to sing at least at a sub-vocalist level. Many older groups have rappers that can\u2019t sing very well. (Which is kind of okay, they\u2019re rappers not singers, they don\u2019t have to be good at singing..) I doubt there is anyone in the industry that is completely tone deaf. Even rapping requires some level of understanding pitch. Suga and RM from BTS are incredible rappers but aren\u2019t as good singing wise. Mingi and Hongjoong from ATEEZ are again, amazing rappers, but aren\u2019t great at singing. Please note I\u2019m not insulting them, I think it\u2019s good to focus on a certain aspect of music and concentrate on getting better at it. A lot of great rappers can\u2019t sing as well, and I think that\u2019s very telling. While diversity in talent is good, many people become mediocre at many things rather than great at many things.

Most, if not all idols, even rappers/dancers are required to be able to sing. This is because Korean-pop music is still pop music, and that\u2019s vocal based. In the case of SM, I\u2019m pretty sure continuous vocal lessons are mandatory for trainees regardless of their positions (see Shindong, Kris Wu, Chanyeol, Minho etc). With that being said, that doesn\u2019t mean that the idols started off knowing how to sing. They could\u2019ve very well auditioned with a dance piece or a part of a rap and gotten accepted based on that. It\u2019s just that to debut, you must be able to sing hence there should not be any idols who can\u2019t sing. ",

An exception to this is for example Red Velvet\u2019s Son Seungwan, or Wendy. She\u2019s a genuinely good singer, with a broad vocal range. However, most kpop singers are only okay good singers, some are even pretty bad. This is because stamina and stability while dancing is considered more important than actual vocal quality. ",
