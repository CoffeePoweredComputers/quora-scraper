            "answer_text": "The answer is similar to that related to the question, \"Why does wearing jeans and tee shirts make you cool?\" The answer is this : it brings you closer to the occidental culture. \"Cool\" is a very occidental word, so to speak. Surprisingly,  it was coined by the Afro-Americans. Now this word has become a part of our daily vocabulary, we find it hard to substitute this word by any other. Let's look at the question in a different way, shall we? The majority of population who use the word 'cool' come from the age group 8 to 35. And that's the age range when one has the maximum zeal to do something adventurous and experimental. That's where western music plays a role. It provides a good background music to their fast paced lives. Think about it, who cares how Ellie Goulding sings, her songs top charts basically because of the creativity in the background score. Given below are some genres the young generations like, and the type of music suited for the purpose : Crime thriller : Alternative rockParties : EDM (electronic dance music) Being popular : PopGrieving about miseries in life in an aggressive way : Death metal rock Hanging around with friends : Punk, Rap, Alternative rock, Pop (depends on gender and age) Falling in love : Pop, Soft songs with piano instrumental Break ups : same as above (sorry, point 6 and 7 aren't actually my field of expertise, any suggestion is welcome) So basically, what do you see? Of course you can argue that Bollywood covers these genres too, but Bollywood fails to impress the westernised mass because of its overly earnest lyrics, and a very few good diplomatic songs exist in Bollywood for the reason.  However, listening to Western music isn't anything bad. I like western music, but I am a student of Indian classical music at the same time. I like both ends of this beam balance, it's fun at the same time to be able to handle such contrasts. I used to be a pretty good rapper too - lack of practice hath its effects. As long as your roots are strong, music is at your finger tips, nothing in the world is going to stop you. :D ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on which type is song are you listening.In Hindi songs, especially these days Hindi songs, they don't care for the lyrics. Delhi wali girlfriend, tamanche pe disco and other songs, whom, I see in the top 10 list, have really boring lyrics.While, most of the English songs {include old Hindi songs as well} are focused on lyrics. And the singers have a sweet throat. It all depends on presentation! The melody fades when lyrics doesn't make sense!There is no shortage of talent anywhere, but how many Indians can actually fulfill their dreams? While, in the west, it isn't bad if a person wants to excel in a field which is not related to study! (Include sport as well). So, listening to music with English words is preferred. And if more and more people do it, it becomes *cool*. Nah, nothing like that!One friend of mine has a collection of good Hindi songs. And she doesn't listen to English ones. And she has no problem with \"oh you listen to Hindi [sic] songs\" remarks. It is up to ones choice. ",
