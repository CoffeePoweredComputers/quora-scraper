            "answer_text": "The Pacifica series is a great series to start off with on the Yamaha brand. My first ever electric guitar was the Pacifica 112. She made me the man I am today! I\u2019ve attached a picture of all four of the guitars that you wanted a comparison for.  These guitars range from a beginner model PAC112V to the PAC212VFM. The quality of parts also differ in that respect. It is always advisable to try these guitars out at your local music shop to see what works for you. You might just be happier with the cheaper 112V compared to the more expensive 311. You can head over to the Yamaha website for a more in depth comparison. ",
