I suggest you search the trailers for these movies in YouTube. If it\u2019s still isn\u2019t here on the list, it might be that your movie was not that popular, or not even remotely remarkable to begin with so as not to even register on Google\u2019s first search results page.

            "answer_text": "This is an extremely broad question; it's like asking a bookstore clerk to identify a specific book where someone dies. If you could recount some of the plot points, that would help in identifying the movie. The two obvious ones are:Night of the Demons (1988)Dream Demon (1988) Even if they're not what you're looking for, you might find something worth watching! ",
