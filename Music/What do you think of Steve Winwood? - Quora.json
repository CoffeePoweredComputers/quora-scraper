Not to mention that in addition to being a pretty fair singer, he\u2019s an accomplished multi-instrumentalist. Having said that, I admit to never having been a big fan. Spencer Davis had its moments, but Traffic and Blind Faith outside of a few songs like \u201c40,000 Headmen\u201d or \u201cCan\u2019t Find My Way Home\u201d never really connected. Some of Winwood\u2019s solo efforts I\u2019ve liked - his remake of the Timmy Thomas song, \u201cWhy Can\u2019t We Live Together\u201d is rather good - but taken as a whole, he\u2019s a middle-of-the-roader for me.

I especially like his singing on this one from the Go project of Stomu Yamashta, Steve Winwood and Michael Shrieve:  Beautiful guitar solo from Pat Thrall on this song. Al Di Meola also had prominent moments on the album. (I don\u2019t recall who was the lyricist) Live version:  ",
