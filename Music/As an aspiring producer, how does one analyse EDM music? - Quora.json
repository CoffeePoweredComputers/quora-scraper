            "answer_text": "First, listen! Then, listen again. Really, just keep listening. I can\u2019t stress this enough. In EDM, there are really two key things that you\u2019ll need to master: sound design and song structure. Sound design is crafting your synthesizer patches to \u201csound right\u201d for the kind of song you\u2019re making. Try to recreate sounds that you think are cool. You\u2019ll need to understand what synthesizers are and how they work. Song structure is also very important. While listening to your favorite EDM tracks, count out measures. Pay attention to at which measure the song\u2019s buildup ends, where the breakdown occurs and how many measures it lasts. You\u2019re going to notice that these transitions typically occur at measures which are multiples of 4. EDM is all about manipulating the energy of the audience on the dance floor. The buildups and breakdowns are key to achieving audience participation. ",

            "answer_text": "It is helpful to get project packs (like another person here said). Also useful to drop a track into a DAW to look at it and examine the sections. Chop up intro, verse, chorus, build, breakdown, etc. and take notes on characteristics: what is the tempo? what genre(s) would this fall into?what are the characteristics of the main drum elements: is kick long or short, is snare tight or have a tail, what is going on with the hats, are they using other percussion elements (shakers, congas, metal hits, pots and pans, etc.)run it through mixed in key to figure out key signatureconsider the mix: what are the dominant elements, where is the sub coming from \u2014- are they focused on mid basses with an underlying sub, or is it an 808 style boomy kick with a long tail providing the subconsider the sounds / sound design: what keeps it interesting? is there movement on the bass (like all dubstep does), or is it a lot of interplay of different sound elements (complextro), is there a vocal and what is it doing?Of course you can go much deeper. This is a great video both for substance and also to coach you on how to dissect and analyze music:  ",

            "answer_text": "Keep listening to one producer and all of their collaborations. Once you can identify their songs, move on to other artist. Martin garrix has a very distinct genre and style of music. Or sometimes I use lie down and put music in my ears and not listen to the song, but what makes the song. The first layers of the first chords or kicks that are the basic layouts for a song and notes that make the melody catch that isn't the main melody. Since you're an aspiring producer I wouldn't say take my word for this because I don't produce but since you are an aspiring producer, have some fun and try to replicate sounds that you hear in songs that you've never heard. Chainsmokers also have good breakdowns YouTube videos on their song \u201cdon't let me down\u201d. They go in detail and talk about what's in their songs and sounds they point out in their track that you don't even hear. ",

You can also search for tips online, such as \u201cHow to make a Future Bass patch\u201d, etc. I like to map out the song I\u2019m analysing in Google Sheets (or my DAW), then translate whatever ideas I have into that structure. I\u2019ve recently written a blog post on it: Calvin Harris Production Secrets - This is What You Came For (ft. Rihanna) I hope this helps! ",
