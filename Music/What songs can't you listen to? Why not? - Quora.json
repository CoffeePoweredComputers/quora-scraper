But I do have \u201cguidelines\u201d for each song I listen to, on a song-by-song basis: Songs with cussing (I don\u2019t mind d\u2014n and h-ll so much, but dropping f bombs, or saying b\u2014ch, s--t, and slurs really gets on my nerves).Songs to glorify sex/lust (like the ones about going to the club just for sex or how good sex with some girl is or how good it feels\u2014as a demisexual christian person I get nothing out of this anyway other than being grossed out lmbo).Songs that glorify self-love (not motivational/inspirational \u201cI/you can do this\u201d type songs, but the ones that are like \u201cI\u2019m the greatest in the world and no one else matters. I\u2019m better than everyone.\u201d songs that encourage arrogance and self-centeredness).Songs that glorify or mention drugs/alcohol use (I don\u2019t mind it in some cases, if it\u2019s mentioned they are drinking beer or something in the song\u2026 but I hate songs solely about drinking or a certain type of alcohol\u2026 and I can\u2019t tolerate any songs about drugs).Songs that glorify material possessions and wealth (the ones bragging about nice jewelry and expensive clothes or how great life is having 40 Beemers in the garage, making it seems as if having wealth is the definition of \u201cmaking it\u201d, when it\u2019s the furthest thing from it lol)\u2026yeah that\u2019s about it. Other than that, I\u2019m pretty game for any song and don\u2019t have any guilty pleasure tunes. ",

            "answer_text": "Ice Ice Baby. Now don't get me wrong, it's an okay song. It was my jam a few years ago. I would bust out this song any chance I got. But now I refuse to even listen to it. Let me explain. I got really into the band Queen about a year ago. If you don't know, Queen has this song called \u201cUnder Pressure,\u201d which they produced along with David Bowie. Under Pressure is a good song. So good, even, that rapper Vanilla Ice chose to use the iconic bassline from it without permission. I get it, it happens a lot in the music producing world, but this instance still triggers me. Eventually Vanilla Ice was involved in a lawsuit regarding copyright and all that jazz, but he was still allowed to sell the song. I remember once when I was rapping Ice Ice Baby for my uncle, and he played the song in the background while I sang. The song started, and I thought everything was all good. Until the first lyrics played. It wasn't Ice Ice Baby; my uncle was playing Under Pressure to purposefully confuse me. I was so disoriented. I felt so violated! I had no idea what Queen or David Bowie was, and I had no idea what this disgraceful song was. But now I know. And now every time I hear Ice Ice Baby, that just plain unoriginal song, I feel a pang of rage. . . Your f(r)iend, Evelyn ",
