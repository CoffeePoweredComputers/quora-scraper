            "answer_text": "Basically Psy is telling all the \u201csexy ladies\u201d that he\u2019s a rich Oppa (in this case not older brother but older boyfriend) who\u2019s from Gangnam (one of the richest places in Seoul). I call it the Macarena of KPop. At first I thought it was cute and funny like Psy but quickly it was overplayed and became annoying. Let\u2019s face it, Psy is too old to really be an idol and he\u2019s not very good looking so this was kind of a joke - I\u2019m not hot, my voice is ok, I can dance a little, but hey, this Oppa is from Gangnam so if you\u2019re sexy I can financially take care of you. He was partially poking fun at himself. You see that a lot in Korea, everyone thinks we all look like idols or drama actors/actresses and we don\u2019t. The big thing with men in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s in Korea is to flaunt their money and possessions and where they live. Many men wait to that age to marry while they make money and buy things so that they can then get young pretty wives in their mid lives and then have kids. Even Kim Jong Kook, who has the looks and talent, is finally ready to look for a wife and have kids at 44. But is he looking for a 44 year old? Nope, he is looking at girls in their late 20\u2019s. He\u2019s not just on Running Man, he tours with Turbo (2019 version) and has a business with Haha. He\u2019s amassing his wealth so he can finally rest and find a young, beautiful wife. Psy\u2019s song kind of reflects that attitude. Oppa is rich, Oppa is from Gangnam, I\u2019m way older than you but I have everything a Korean girl is looking for in a man (Jong Kook also still has his looks, Psy doesn\u2019t). It\u2019s meant to be silly but it\u2019s still a comment on Korean society these days. Someone else gave the literal meaning of the lyrics, but that\u2019s the gist and the meaning behind the lyrics. ",
