            "answer_text": "By doing this they are actually playing with human psychology. Most of the viewers don't subscribe to the channel by their own will, no body does. But when a creator productively asks them to do so, they are actually creating some chances of people subscribing to their channel if they want to see more videos from the same creator. The creator just reminds the viewers that if they have not subscribed they should in order to see more videos from him/her. Also for themselves, the more the subscribers the more fast views as people will get the notification of their uploads so there are chances they will watch the video. ",
