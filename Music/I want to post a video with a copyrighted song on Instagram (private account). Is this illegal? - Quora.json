            "answer_text": "Updated: September 17th 2020 No, it\u2019s no longer illegal. I recently uploaded Justin Bieber\u2019s Single : Yummy (Remix) ft Summer Walker on Instagram, and this is what happened.  Instagram will send a video block notification telling you that the content posted contains copyrighted material, but the video is still visible on your account to your followers. You can click on Tap to review to see where the video is available:  Depending on the copyright holder\u2019s restrictions, the content may be fully available in some countries but blocked in others. This follows the YouTube Music Copyright policy, where certain songs are partially blocked in some territories while others are completely blocked.  If you have the rights to the copyrighted content you can go ahead and appeal, if not simply disregard the notice. YOUR VIDEO WILL NOT BE REMOVED. Cheers, Enjoy. NOTE: The next section is for copyright holder's only.  For those with Rights to Copyrighted Content: Click on Appeal.  Simply put in your Electronic Signature then click appeal. Appealing the block notice will make the video available worldwide and in all countries. Looking through the list, most of the popular countries are already included namely united States, Canada, United Kingdom and over 25+ other countries where the video is already fully available. However, once you appeal, your video is now available worldwide. If you found this helpful. Upvote & Share. Thank you.  In 2018 Yes. Instantly your video would be removed.  On several occasions, I have uploaded videos to Instagram and they were removed immediately. But this is no longer the case. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. It you purchased the rights to listen to the song (i.e. bought the CD or download) and you're account is private ONLY for your own personal use then it can be legal if you request (in writing to the company that owns the copyright) permission to use the song. You could try to use the magic words 'fair use', but that usually leads to rejection in a case like this (especially with Sony). Now if you want to have it stay in your private account, then once/if you get approval, you'll need to pass that over to Instagram. FYI - it's also possible that the song you want to use is only copyrighted in specific countries too. For example, I have music videos that I've put together where the copyrighted music is muted/changed in USA viewings, but is okay for Canadian-based viewers after requesting certain permissions. ",
