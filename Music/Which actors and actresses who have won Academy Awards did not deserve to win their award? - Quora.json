            "answer_text": "There are many examples but here is one from each category. Elizabeth Taylor BUtterfield 8, Best Actress Winner (BTW BUtterfield is spelled correctly)  Taylor was beautiful, and adequate as a prostitute who has a tragic affair with a married man. But her performance was hardly a standout, especially against her competition who gave phenomenal performances-Melina Mercouri, Deborah Kerr, Greer Garson, and Shirley MacLaine, who most critics thought should have won. Many Academy voters admitted that Taylor\u2019s performance was the least of the lot, but they felt bad because this was Taylor\u2019s 4th nomination in a row and she had lost the previous 3. Jimmy Stewart, The Philadelphia Story, 1940 Best Actor  Stewart was an icon and he deserved most of his honors but not in this case. The movie was excellent, and he was good, but his performance paled compared to his competition. Raymond Massey should have won, but he wasn\u2019t as popular in Hollywood or as well known. Henry Fonda was also great, but he wasn\u2019t as big as Stewart, and Lawrence Olivier was British at a pro American time. This win was the classical example of the Oscars being a popularity contest. Kim Bassinger, LA Confidential, 1997, Best Supporting Actress  Bassinger wasn\u2019t terrible, but her performances have always been hit or miss and this is a miss. Her competition was intense, the more gifted actresses that were her contemporaries Joan Cusack, Julianne Moore and Minnie Driver. Gloria Stuart, also nominated for Titanic was called the \u201csentimental favorite.\u201d But at 86 she endured an arduous shooting schedule giving a fabulous valedictory to a long career. That is everything the Oscar is supposed to stand for-but Stuart was old, and Bassinger was more beautiful than her competition. The classic example of winning on looks. Walter Matthau, The Fortune Cookie, 1966  This one is a little tougher. Matthau was an amazing actor who was robbed more than once of awards that he deserved more than his competition. But not in this case. His performance in this movie was very good. But look at his competition, Mako-his performance was incredible, but the Academy rarely awards minorities, especially in the 1960s. James Mason who took a potentially creepy character and made him relatable in Georgie Girl, talented newcomer George Segal, and Robert Shaw who had given an amazing performance in the classic A Man For All Seasons. But Matthau had a heart attack during filming but came back to work as soon as possible. His Oscar in this case was more of a participation trophy. ",

            "answer_text": "I was disappointed when (most recent, going backwards to 1980 when I first began following the Oscars at age 10): Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side beat Meryl Streep in Julie and Julia, because Streep's performance was truly memorable and great.Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood beat Johnny Depp in Sweeney Todd, because it was seriously brave of Johnny to sing, and a real stretch for him; all DDL did was yell a lot.Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line beat Felicity Huffman in Transamerica, because while I have nothing against Reese or that film, Huffman's performance remains one of the bravest I've ever seen.Tim Robbins in Mystic River beat Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai, because while I have nothing against Tim Robbins, Watanabe absolutely commanded in Samurai.(This is where everyone knows I'm going to say Johnny got rooked as Captain Jack. Let's just move on, shall we?)Nicole Kidman in The Hours beat Julianne Moore in Far From Heaven; this was the year Kidman was dumped by Tom Cruise, and she had he sympathy vote for essentially acting maudlin and wearing a prosthetic nose.Jim Broadbent in Iris beat Ian McKellen in Lord of the Rings -- to me, this is one of the saddest crimes in Oscar history.Marcia Gay Harden in Pollock beat Kate Hudson in Almost Famous -- see above.Benicio del Toro in Traffic beat Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator; while del Toro gave a great performance, Phoenix was downright diabolical and weird, and I thought he absolutely deserved the award.(As long as I'm bashing the 2000 Oscars with the above two...) Russell Crowe in Gladiator beat Geofrrey Rush in Quills; I don't understand how that happened other than Gladiator had higher box office.James Coburn in Affliction beat Ed Harris in The Truman Show.Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets beat Dustin Hoffman in Wag the Dog.Frances McDormand in Fargo beat Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves; Fargo is loved by many filmies and I love Frances McDormand, however, this was a cop with an annoying Midwestern accent versus a lady who goes completely bat-shit crazy. Crazy should have won.I think the 1995 Oscars were one of the most competitive years for Supporting Actor I've ever seen. Kevin Spacey won for Usual Suspects, and that was worthy, but it bears mention that three of the other four nominees (James Cromwell, Ed Harris and Brad Pitt) deserved it just as much as Spacey did. And I have to note that had they swapped out Tim Roth for Patrick McGoohan, for playing Edward Longshanks in Braveheart, it would have been the most perfect list of nominees in a single category at any Oscars ceremony I've ever watched.Dianne Wiest in Bullets Over Broadway beat Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction.I'm conflicted about Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump beating Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption...it's pretty damned close.Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman beat Robert Downey, Jr. in Chaplin. The Downey absolutely captivated me in that one. Captivated. Me.I know many will not agree, but, I really wanted Anne Ramsey to win Supporting Actress for Throw Momma From the Train. She lost to Olympia Dukakis in Moonstruck.I was stunned...STUNNED...when Whoopi Goldberg in The Color Purple lost to Geraldine Page in The Trip to Bountiful.In another one I consider to be one of the most unfortunate Oscar losses of all time, Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi in The Karate Kid lost to Haing S. Nor in The Killing Fields.While I loved Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer and A Gentleman, Charles Durning's performance in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas still never fails to make me smile, even thinking about it...it had more staying power with me.I was happy for Ben Kingsley when he won for Gandhi, but it was painful to realize he had done so at the expense of Peter O'Toole in My Favorite Year. Alan Swann is one of my favorite film characters of all time.Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People beating out Joe Pesci in Raging Bull? Ridiculous.So yeah...there you have it. If you're still reading, thanks. The problem is never to get me to answer an Oscar question but to get me to shut up. ;) ",
