            "answer_text": "I think you need to rethink about your decision once again CAREFULLY. Your mum has financially strained herself and money to support you as a pianist. If you plan to become a kpop idol. You need to understand the consequences you will face. So many kpop idols are just as talented as you are. Most of them can sing with the most ridiculous high range effortlessly while others can break dance during their sleep. But only a few by 1% can make it through to their last contract without being disbanded early. Blackpink, BTS, Seventeen, TWICE, Somi, IU and many more artists went through unimaginable crap to be where they are now. Think about your decision carefully! Better yet, talk about it with your mum. Ask her what she thinks about kpop artists. Set up plans to tell your mum how you want to be a kpop idol. Tell her: Why you want to be a kpop idol?How you will be Able to succeed?What will you do with your success?If you ever fail to debut, what your plan b will be?How you will take care of yourself financially?Set UP your plans and answers above so that your mum will not have to worry you pursing this kpop idol career?? If she disagrees with you becoming a kpop idol it's only because she's worried about you. She's your mum. You can have many dreams but at the end of the day, you only have ONE MUM!! ",

            "answer_text": "Reading other comments I will agree.If your mom has prepared you for 14 years it\u2019s really hard to tell her you want to do something else.Being a pianist you can do a lot with that and gain money but when you want to be a kpop idol it\u2019s risky.You can waste many years of your life training but not making it in the end so I would say being a pianist is safer. If you really want to be a kpop idol it\u2019s a great goal or dream to have.You should prepare yourself mentally and physically for training and if you do make it then congratulations.Unless you are in the big three it\u2019s pretty hard to get extremely popular like BTS or Blackpink but you can try.Anyways good luck! -BunBun ",
