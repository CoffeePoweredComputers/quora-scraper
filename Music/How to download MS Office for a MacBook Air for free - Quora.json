They provide all essential features as MS office and run faster on the Mac. Also it is free and all updates are free. Nice interface, you can create, save and open .xls, xlsx files. If you are going to use high end features in Excel, MS office the way to go. It has pivot tables and similar statistical tools which are good in Excel which are not available in other spreadsheet tools. I used my MacBook for engineering and MBA. But Numbers, pages, and keynote were enough for me. ",

In fact that's how I had Office on my Mac for years. Otherwise you can use free alternatives, such as iWork, AbiWord, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, NeoOffice, or Google Docs. You could also consider Office Online, if you have a Microsoft account. ",
