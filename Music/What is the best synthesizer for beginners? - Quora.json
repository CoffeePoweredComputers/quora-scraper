            "answer_text": "As with all things, it depends on your budget and your experience in other areas. I personally think that everybody should be working with an analog synth first simply because of the one-to-one (often) correlation between controls and parameters (so you can immediately hear the impact that the parameter has on the timbre) and the fact that subtractive synthesis is the paradigm by which all synths that followed split from. Along those lines, if you're an engineer or experimental scientist, I'd say buy a decent used Roland, Korg, or even Moog analog synth. If it needs a little work, you'll be likely to be able to work on it and get it up and running and many of these can be found on Craigslist for the $100 to $200 range. If you're not so technically skilled but still have a few bucks to go, I think really the ideal choice is an Arturia Microbrute. These can be had open box new for about $200 and are absolutely addictive, totally educational, and sound as professional as their big brothers. Even if you're not a beginner, I highly recommend these. Further down the price line and used for about $100 is the Korg Volca Bass (NOT the Volca Keys). The Volca Bass is a cleaner (and, I would argue, warmer) analog polysynth than is the Keys. It's simpler than the Microbrute and not as educational, but it's still great - sounding and packs a lot of analog for the money. If you still want to go hardware but are even more budget conscious, a Korg Monotron can be had for about $35, and is true analog with a warm filter and even an audio input. Don't expect MIDI or even anything but a membrane keyboard at this price, but folks have actually recorded with these and you can literally carry one in your pocket. Finally, if you're broke but have a pc and an internet connection...and ideally a MIDI controller keyboard (old style, non-usb ones can be had for as low as $5 on Craigslist...then get a $4 usb to MIDI adapter on Amazon and you're set), just download Synth1 and a vsti wrapper (the free DAW, Cakewalk, from Bandlab will work fine) and you'll have a warm sounding, professional virtual studio technology instrument (vsti) emulation of a Nord Lead 2 analog modelling synthesizer. You'll still learn all about analog synths, subtractive synthesis, probably more FM synthesis than you'd want to, and then also about vst plugins, MIDI, and DAW software...oh, and don't worry, the learning curve is a little steep, but with some patience, you'll find yourself sounding as good as (if not better than) all of the hardware synths described above. ...If that's too daunting for you, I still think I've got my Monotron laying around somewhere. Did I ever tell you about how warm the filter is on this thing? Well, let me explain.... Edit: Since I posted this, the battery-powered option Korg Monologue with the built in oscilloscope has come on to the market. I think that the MicroBrute still sounds better, but for a beginner, the combination of oscilloscope and battery power make it my current top pick for a beginner. Add in a PC librarian, a per-patch sequencer, two oscillators, and a price that's even better than the MicroBrute, and it's a no-brainer. These can also actually be picked up used for less than $200 now. Amazing! A second place to this today would probably also be the IK Multimedia Unosynth. No keys, and about the size of a paperback, this little guy has no graphical display and isn't the most well-built synth, but it sports both multiple oscillator types, two oscillators, lots of effects, unique real time performance controls, and a KILLER sound. Starting at just $200 new, these are great little synths you can carry with you and are super for a beginner! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on various factors such as\u2026 Your budget\u2026 you can pick up \u2018home keyboards\u2019 for around 100USD, but a programmable synth is going to cost 500USD upwards.What you want it for\u2026 live playing, recording, learning, etc.The most common keyboard size is 5 octaves (61 keys). If you play the piano, you may want 88 keys.You may want weighted keys rather than the more common (and cheaper) lightweight plastic ones.Do you want built-in speakers, or would use headphones or an external amplifier?Most home keyboards come with a decent set of sounds, typically pianos, organs, brass, woodwind, strings, choirs, drums and tympani, as well as a number of more \u2018synthetic\u2019 sounds. Is this enough, or do you want to be able to edit or create your own sounds, and save them?I note that some of the recommendations are for monophonic synths (ie. can only play one note at a time). The advantage of mono-synths is that they (mostly) have more knobs, so controlling the sound generation is more spontaneous; and they (mostly) use analogue electronics, so are unlikely to allow you to save your sounds.If you want to record your own compositions, you have the option of hooking your keyboard up to a computer and using a software recording package like Logic Pro, GarageBand or Cubase; or choosing a \u2018workstation\u2019\u2026 a keyboard with built-in recording capability.I\u2019ve owned 23 synths over a forty-year time frame. I\u2019ve sold most of them, but still have a Korg Z1 (digital modelling) synth, a Technics KN3000 workstation, an Alesis \u2018ROMpler\u2019, a Yamaha home keyboard (runs on batteries, so great for picnics, etc.). And I\u2019ve just bought a Roland Juno DS61, which totally knocks my socks off! ",
