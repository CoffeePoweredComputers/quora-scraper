            "answer_text": "Any musical instrument purchase is an investment, both of your money and your time, and the accordion is a complex beast to get started with. As such I would recommend borrowing an accordion for a couple of weeks if possible to make sure it's really the instrument for you before committing to making a purchase. After that you have two options:  1) Take a look at eBay/craigslist/freecycle etc. and try to pick up a cheap used box. The downside with this approach is the boxes available are likely to not be in good functional condition (leaky bellows, stuck keys, de-tuned/missing reeds etc.). It's also very likely that you end up with a big box that has a lot more buttons and voices than you need. This makes the box heavy and hard to play and is very likely to put off a new player. 2) Buy a new student box from a recognised seller These boxes will cost a bit more than those on ebay etc. but has the advantage that you get exactly what you need. Any good music shop will be able to give you advice on the right box for you (in terms of complexity and weight) and should also have a returns policy should you decide it's really not for you. I have gone through several accordions and always bought from music shops, so I can only comment further on that approach. Like any significant purchase there is a range of quality from cheap Chinese boxes, mid-range European boxes and top end Italian (mainly) boxes. I would advise against going in at the cheapest end of the spectrum, you really do get what you pay for; I've tried a couple of the really cheap ones and the tone and action is very poor and won't help your playing at all - also I don't see them lasting well (or holding value).  My approach has been to buy the smallest box that gets me playing and then upgrade as I reach the limits of that instrument. Personally I play mainly british and European folk music, and tend to play out and about a lot (in pubs and festivals) so for me the weight of a box is really important, as well as the range and quality of tone. When I started out I tried quite a variety of boxes and ended up with a Weltmeister, I then upgraded to a larger Weltmeister and after another couple of years moved on to a Pigini Preludio P36/3 3 voice 72 Bass Piano Accordion   .  This is my current box and I love it - a really nice compromise of light-ish weight, combination of voices, bass range, portability and style. The only change I would make, in an ideal world, would be to cycle the basses around so that the top note is a c\u266f - but that's another story. So I would recommend Weltmeister student boxes - although these do seem to have gone up in price considerably since I started out.Primo 48 Bass Piano Accordion Standard Reeds Other good student boxes I have tried include Hohner:Bravo and Black Diamond:Black Diamond Accordions - buy new affordable accordions and melodeons online, 48 Bass piano accordionBlack Diamond Accordions - buy new affordable accordions and melodeons online, 72 Bass piano accordion ",

            "answer_text": "The accordion is one of the most, if not the most, complicated acoustic instruments out there. As such, is ridiculously easy to get one that looks great, but has significant problems.  There are plenty of websites that list reputable brands as well as things to check when inspecting an accordion. However, I think a much safer approach would be to take lessons with a good teacher and ask them to help you find one. Most likely, they will either have accordions you could rent or will be able to point you to a reputable local seller. They will also be able to help you determine what kind of accordion would best suit your musical tastes and goals. ",
