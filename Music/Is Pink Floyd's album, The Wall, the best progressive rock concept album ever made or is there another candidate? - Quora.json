            "answer_text": "I think The Wall is when Pink Floyd jumped the shark. Please, no haters, it\u2019s just my opinion and musical taste. Meddle (Echoes)/Dark side, Wish and Animals were so creative and are still my favorites. I bought The Wall when it came out and do like most of the album....however its very depressing and, I dunno...too British. Kind of like British comedy, some like it, others just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m still a bit traumatized from seeing The Wall movie. I won\u2019t watch it again. Just too disturbing and ruined the album for me with the depressing mental imagery I now have of the music. And if I never have to hear Another Brick in the Wall for the zillionth time on \u201cclassic rock\u201d radio I could die happy. Eat you meat, eat your pudding....please. Arguably the worst song on the album. Having said that a couple of suggestions: Jeff Wayne\u2019s War of the Worlds  A double album (back in 1979?) musical version of the well known story. Talent abounds...Richard Burton, our storyteller, Justin Hayward from the Moody Blues, Phil Lynott (Thin Lizzy) and I\u2019m probably leaving out many of the other talented musicians. A real treat if you\u2019re going on a long drive or have about two hours to immerse yourself in the story. Porcupine Tree-Fear of a Blank Planet  The theme is of overmedicated, bored teens living pointless lives, getting stoned, playing video games and contemplating mass violence. Porcupine Tree-Voyage 34  An entire album devoted to an acid trip. Long instrumentals, trippy, psychedelic. Maybe not for everyone. Thanks to all the Quora responders for their suggestions. A whole lot of music to check out, some I never knew existed. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not even close. It\u2019s not even in the top three concept albums by Pink Floyd. \u2018The Wall\u2019 has some great moments, but it is the moment where Roger Waters got too much control over the group and, as a result, is self-indulgent, bloated, overlong and in thrall to his obsession with World War II. Each of their previous three albums are better, more concise, more focused. Just look at \u2018Wish You Were Here\u2019, a concept album about the idea of absence, as Storm Thorgerson\u2019s extraordinary artwork illustrates. Now that\u2019s ambitious. It is tempting to think how much better \u2018The Wall\u2019 would be as a single album, with the driftwood cut-out, and blame its weakness on the double album format, but I recently listened to \u2018The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\u2019 \u2013 never one of my favourite Genesis albums \u2013 and it is quite brilliant, with all the linking passages between the better songs making perfect sense and contributing to the whole. \u2018The Wall\u2019 is just not that good. It\u2019s nothing like as good as \u2018Animals\u2019, \u2018Wish You Were Here\u2019 and \u2018Dark Side Of The Moon\u2019, and there are days when I\u2019d take Pink Floyd\u2019s earlier work over any of those. Here are 20 concept albums that are all better than \u2018The Wall\u2019... What\u2019s Going On \u2013 Marvin Gaye Tommy \u2013 The Who Illinoise \u2013 Sufjan Stevens The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway \u2013 Genesis Ziggy Stardust & the Spiders From Mars \u2013 David Bowie Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band \u2013 The Beatles Animals \u2013 Pink Floyd Smile \u2013 Brian Wilson Quadrophenia \u2013 The Who Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City \u2013 Kendrick Lamar The Village Green Preservation Society \u2013 The Kinks Ogdens Nut Gone Flake \u2013 The Small Faces Berlin \u2013 Lou Reed De-Loused in The Comatorium - The Mars Volta Yoshimi Battles The Robots \u2013 Flaming Lips Demon Days \u2013 Gorillaz Kid A \u2013 Radiohead Sonic Highways \u2013 Foo Fighters Desperado \u2013 The Eagles Thick As A Brick \u2013 Jethro Tull ",
