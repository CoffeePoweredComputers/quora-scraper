            "answer_text": "Target, Walmart, Barnes & Noble - they still sell CDs, just not nearly as many, and the trend is continuing downward. Even independent labels can get into those stores through distributors. The problem is they don\u2019t move off the shelves as fast as they used to. I agree with Reginald Shipman\u2019s answer that CDs are like business cards. I still purchase CDs from band, especially live shows, and use them to upload to my computer and ultimately phone to listen to. Independent labels have the same problem as other artists and labels- how do I get my artists\u2019 music in your ears? At a show, CDs are still the best way to do that. Download cards can work too, but CDs nearly guarantee you\u2019ll throw it in your car radio on the way home from the show. Then you might leave it playing the next day and the next day. The download card may never get used. So the main way to do that through CDs is at shows. ",

            "answer_text": "There are still stores that sell cds and usually through an online distributor like cd baby (who by the way does an excellent job).  Here's the real although.  Cd's for indis are like business cards (you use them to spread your virus).  Don't let folks fool you into believing noone listens to cd's, it's just not true.  If you have a real fanbase you have a better chance of your fanbase engaging with a cd and the potential for others to hear your product is greater (in the earbuds that is an isolated activity and usually it has a low potential of potential fans going \"what are you listening to?  be mindful of this.  At this point it's almost a compliment for the bootlegger to chose your music (bootleggers don't choose music that's not market worthy usually...). ",
