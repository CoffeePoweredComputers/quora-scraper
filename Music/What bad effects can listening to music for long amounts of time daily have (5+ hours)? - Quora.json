            "answer_text": "Well it depends at what volume you listening music If you listen music at no more than 85 db it will not cause any hearing damage But if you listen music at max volume (100\u2013120 db depends on speaker headphones), only after 15min you will get temporary hearing damage, after 30 minute there will be big chances of permanent hearing damage)  I listen music about 3h per day and never go above 90 db. *For people that think 3 hours is a lot One album lasts about 1hIts nothing compared to professional music producents (They are exposed to music 6+ h)Most of audiophiles like me cant live without quality music",

            "answer_text": "Anything which is done excessively can have detrimental effects on us. In this case, listening to music for more than 5+ hours may interfere with other things that you need to get done such as working and/or studying. If the volume is too loud, it may do permanent damage to your hearing. And if you spend the time alone, it may interfere with socialization and affect the quality and/or quantity of your relationships and friendships. Otherwise to me, it seems to be quite a healthy pursuit, especially for those of us who are passionate about it. ",
