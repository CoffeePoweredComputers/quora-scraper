            "answer_text": "Well there are quite a few reasons. I would point out though that these problems are not unique to the Philippines, they are common to many developing countries around the world. I also think they are surmountable and there are many reasons to be optimistic about the prospects for the Philippines in the future. Corruption - It is endemic at all levels and agencies of Government. Graft, embezzlement, fraud and bribery are commonplace. That is the money of the Filipino taxpayer - money that could be spent on development projects and services. It also adversely effects foreign investment because the one thing a business or entrepreneur wants to ensure is that their money and investment is safe. Without healthy institutions you don\u2019t have that.Historical factors from its time as a Spanish Colony - The Spanish had a particularly pervasive way of running their empire. They created a mestizo class to control political and business power. Of course when the Spanish left those powerful dynastic families had no intention of giving up their power. They never legislated for a strong nation state that was free and fair and inclusive for all. Instead they consolidated their wealth and power and to this day the Philippines, a country of over 100 million people, is governed by 400 dynastic families. As they say, \u201cthe faces change but the surnames stay the same.\u201d Former President Aquino\u2019s own family involvement in Politics goes back over 100 years. The Philippines is unfair because it was designed to be that way. The same is true of many former Spanish Colonies in South and Central America.The resulting Oligarchy and lack of free markets - The Country lacks free markets. As a result, without competition their is no incentive to drive up standards and innovate. Case in Point - Philippine internet is one of the slowest connections in Asia. The reason being that there are only a handful of (maybe 4\u20135) internet providers. All are Philippine owned and they can charge high prices for substandard network and infrastructure without fear of facing foreign competition.Market protectionism disrupting the supply chain - Similar to point 3 - market protectionism through high trade tariffs have affected the supply chain. Goods and products are sometimes hard to find and foreign products are overpriced which adversely affects economic growth.Poor education and lack of opportunities - Ambitious and educated Filipinos move abroad leading to a brain drain. Secondary and Tertiary education is generally poor by Western standards and there is a lack of decent career opportunities for young Filipinos. Many never get the opportunity - there may well be a Filipino Bill Gates, but he\u2019s driving a Jeepney or working in a Sari-Sari store because he hasn\u2019t been given the opportunity to succeed.Lack of Infrastructure Investment - There is big untapped potential in the Philippines such as the tourism industry. But the Philippines has suffered from years of under-investment in its crumbling infrastructure. Capital projects such as power, roads, airports and transportation in the Cities and across the archipelago lack serious investment.Meddling of the Catholic Church in Public Policy - Overpopulation, Poverty, Urban Sprawl and Pollution are all serious problems. While the Catholic Church is not directly to blame for these - they have advocated unhelpful positions such as opposition to Bills designed to help fight these issues. The largest population growth rate is taking place among the poorest in Filipino society, the 40% that the UN classes as living in poverty. Ironically as the Philippines develops economically the number of people living in poverty is actually increasing\u2026As I mentioned I think most of these issues are surmountable and I am not overly pessimistic about the Philippines future. I have been there many times and there is a fairly robust middle class now developing. ",

            "answer_text": "We\u2019re an archipelago - We have thousand of islands, our major islands are composed of hills and mountains, meaning, almost all infrastructure projects are expensive, due to our societies being spread out by both land and sea, we need to invest in multiple ways of transportation to connect themWe\u2019re located on the path were typhoons and natural disasters occur - How can our government save something if things keep breaking apart yearly? They spend money to fix that, only problem is, the political locomotive is not efficient, there is no way supplies can get to roadless communities unless they invest in choppers, people can\u2019t move unless the paperwork are signed by the superior, the superiors can\u2019t move until they figure out what to do, they can\u2019t figure out what to do due to a lack of informationPolitical instability - The Philippines is plagued by various families and corporations vying for power and influence, politically aligned individuals on a same party would veto any attempts of the opposing party to pass laws that would benefit the nation due to bad blood, some politicians make deals with business people to help them win elections, once they have won, they now owe said people, for this, they pass laws that benefit their businessVast majority of the people are poor and stupid - The fact that the poor makes up the vast majority of our population makes them gullible and easily manipulated, their hardships are being exploited by clever politicians in exchange for promises and temporary relief in the shape of goods and social programs, hence, why the Philippines keeps on electing incompetent politiciansFilipinos are content with what they have - Filipinos have this mindset of being easily content and are willing to endure things that are inconvenient, either a tight full jeep or train, due to this mentality, there is no way to voice concern and turn that concern into improvement as there are no voice complaining, silence means complianceToo much religion, not enough action - This created an anti-intellectual mindset to Filipinos, they do not strive to know more, to question more, to think more, they are content to live a life of blind mediocrity where the questions are being answered and served in a silver plate, why do you oppose abortion? why do you oppose divorce? why do you oppose same sex marriage? The answer? Because the Bible said it\u2019s wrong",
