            "answer_text": "Basically, we dance, because we can! It just seems logical that when a person experiences a pleasing beat, a desire to participate is evoked, and if the listener is not making the music, then he or she must find another way. There is something primal about the desire to move to a rhythmic beat, becoming \u201clost\u201d in the music, and \u201cdriven\u201d to bring it out with carefully timed movements. This drive has been with us for thousands, possibly millions of years. Volumes have been written about the topic, discussing the seemingly intractable influence of rhythm and dance over the development of human societies, and exploring the ways these arts both shaped, and were in turn shaped by various cultures. Humans aren\u2019t the only ones to express a tendency to \u201cmove to the music.\u201d I don\u2019t know about other animals, but many birds seem to get caught-up in a back-beat rhythm, engaging in a range of choreography from simply bobbing their heads, to stepping back-and forth on their perch, in perfect time with the music. So, being what we are, humankind has taken these primal movements to the level of art, and embraced them into mainstream society, and while there may be contention among professional and amateur dancers alike over which form of dance is the most \u201crefined\u201d, all would agree that like many other arts, dance is an emotional expression, but instead of expressing emotion onto canvas, film, clay, or music, a dancer transcribes emotion into movement and \u201cacts it out\u201d in the dance. In a social setting, the same is true, to a greater or lesser degree. A lot of argument can be made that in modern society, social dancing is often part of a courting ritual, but many people simply enjoy learning new steps, and refining their coordination, not to mention that dance is great exercise. I think it\u2019s interesting that whenever people gather in venues that invite dancing, the intent of the average \u201cdancer\u201d is usually to square-off against one desired partner, and impress them with a demonstration of coordinated moves, but when the venue is too crowded, they often end up squirming awkwardly in a packed-mass that doesn\u2019t offer enough space for much coordinated expression.
