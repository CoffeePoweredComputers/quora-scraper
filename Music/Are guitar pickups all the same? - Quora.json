            "answer_text": "I posted this in another thread on accident, Not sure how that happened but you know what they say S**t happens.Anyhow all pickups are not the same.. and here is why from my answer..Pickups are not the same, even if you have two pickups that look alike from the covers they are not necessarily the same.First lets talk magnets, changes in the magnets will change the way the pickup preforms. One of the most common magnets is made from an alloy called Alnico which is an iron alloy with aluminum, nickle and chromium in the mix. Common Alnico pickup magnets are Alinico 2 and Alinco 5. Alnico 2 will provide a more classic tone to a pickups sound while Alnico 5 will be more aggressive. Along with the common magnets there are ceramic magnets and stronger Alnico magnets (in fact I have a custom built set of pickups using an alnico 8 magnet with fewer wraps to provide a more vintage tone with a hotter output.  Oddly the Rickenbacker A4001 bass uses very small magnets that resemble something you would use to hold a child\u2019s drawing to your refrigerator.Other changes you may not be able to see is the number of times the wire wraps around the pickup bobbins. (Here is a pickup bobbin Below)  The number of wraps around the bobbin changes the tone and preformance of a pickup. Once again with the covers in place and the pickup mounted to a guitar, you cannot see this difference. In fact, you may have a difficult time seeing this difference with the covers removed holding the pickup in your hand. While these basic differences in common pickups are difficult if not impossible to see, even if the covers were removed from the pickups. There are a number of different guitar and bass pickups that we have not covered yet. This is a Piezo pickup(below), it slides under the strings and rests on top of the bridge to pick up the string vibrations at that point. This one is for a flamenco guitar. Some of these will mount under the bridge or inside the body of a guitar (often but not always an acoustic)  This is a midi pickup(below) that is used to connect the guitar to a midi device like a keyboard, thus giving the guitar the voice of the midi device.  You have active pickups(below). These provided a much more aggressive tone and require an external power source to operate. This is often supplied by a 9v battery or batteries. These pickups often use a less powerful magnet and a different number of wraps as they are powered and rely on the power to send the signal to the amp.  You have passive single coil pickups which only require the guitar being plugged into an amplifier to operate. Below are a set that I had custom made for a strat styled guitar.Oddly even these three single coil pickups are different.The number of wraps on these pickups change depending on its intended position on the guitar. As well as possible wrap differences with single coil pickups, the center pickup is wired out of phase to the neck and bridge pickup. This means that the positive and negative on this pickup are reversed. This allows the pickup to be used in conjunction with either the bridge or neck pickup and it will cancel the hum created by the pickups.So even in a matched set of single coil pickups the pickups are not necessarily the same, even though they appear the same.  Then you have humbucker pickups these are two pickups wired together to eliminate the hum associated with electric guitars. They also have a hotter output than a single coil pickup. Below are a set that I had custom made with a heavy gauge blue magnet wire under clear bobbins with an Alnico 8 magnet.  There are a number of other variations in pickups above and beyond the number of wraps and magnet types.The single coil and humbucker pickups I showed you have individual pole pieces. This type of pickup will have a circle or a screw (the pole) that aligns with a string on the guitar, there will often be the same numebr of poles as there are strings (however, this is not always the case). Another popular design is a pickup with a bar or solid pole piece (below).  Solid pole pieces also find use in single coil, or single coil sized pickups (like this custom set I had built below)  In this case the bridge and neck pickup are actually 2 pickups (humbuckers) wired into a set of bobbins that fit into a single coil opening. The middle pick up is a single coil pickup. This set is even more flexible as the humbuckers in the bridge and neck have been wired so I can \u201csplit\u201d them. This means that you can push or pull on a knob on the guitar (or flick a switch) and use only one of the pickups in the set or both (a humbucker configuration). This makes the guitar very flexible for the performer as there is a multitude of tones one guitar can create on demand.There are many more configurations of pickups however, this does cover most of the basic types in common use.

            "answer_text": "In one sense, they are mostly all the same: magnetic induction that turns the vibration of metal strings within a magnetic field into an electrical signal. Other than that: no, they are not all the same. For the sake of some brevity, I\u2019ll only get into passive electric guitar pickups here and won\u2019t even touch on active pickups or the various kinds of pickups used for acoustic guitar. First, there is a distinction between single coil and humbucking pickups. A single coil is exactly that: a single coil of wire wrapped around a single bobbin, which contains one set of magnets (or a bar magnet). A humbucker is two coils, one wound in reverse, to cancel out hum. Hence the name \u201chumbucker.\u201d It bucks the hum. Now, there are all different kinds of single coil and humbucking pickups. Each of these variations has a unique construction which affects the magnetic field that it creates, which in turns affects the kind of electrical signal that it feeds to an amp, ultimately changing the amplified tone. For example, there are many variations of single coil pickups, all of them sounding different. Strat pickups are built differently and sound differently than Tele pickups, which are likewise different than Jag pickups, which are different than p90\u2019s, which are different than Jazzmaster pickups. You get the point. p90\u2019s and Jazzmaster pickups especially get mixed up a lot. They may look similar, but they are constructed differently and sound very different. Furthermore, even if you are dealing with only one of the aforementioned variations of single coil pickup (a Strat pickup, for instance), one can sound completely different from the other. Different wire can be used, different magnets can be used, the wire can be wound around the bobbin differently, the magnets can be beveled or unbeveled. The magnets could be six slugs, or it could be one bar. All of this affects the sound. Also, it would be wrong of me at any point to say, \u201cthis pickup sounds the most different from than this one\u201d or \u201cthis kind of pickup always sounds like this.\u201d For instance, a lot of people think the ultimate distinction is between humbucker and single coil. Well, actually, a really good PAF humbucker can sound a lot like a single coil, and I\u2019ve heard different single coil pickups that sounded radically different from each other. ",

            "answer_text": "No, very definitely not! If we just look at electric guitar pickups, leaving out the piezo and contact mic\u2019s on acoustics, there are two main types, single coil and hum bucker. Single coils having a single coil of wire to generate current from the magnetic fluctuations the pole pieces are subjected to. Within single coils there are infinite variations\u2026 the number of turns of wire, the gauge of said copper wire, the type of magnet, the size of pickup, active or passive, the covering material, the positioning of the magnet, the strength of the magnet, the neatness of the wind\u2026 Every one is different. Add all those options in with hum buckers which have two coils of wire, and you get the idea. Now every one of these pickups sound a little different. A hum bucker will generally sound fuller in the low frequency region and have more output than a single coil, a P90 type single coil will have a more focussed midrange and a bark that a telecaster bridge pickup can\u2019t match, but then the P90 and the hum bucker won't do that twang only the tele can produce. A lower output pickup will sound more open and less focussed than a higher output one of the same construction (give me some under-wound lollars for my 335 and I\u2019ll show you magic). Doing something as simple as reversing the polarity of one of the coils in your hum bucker will have generations of guitarists wondering what the special sauce is and supporting a whole pickup industry (I\u2019m looking at you Peter Green). 90% of tone is in the fingers, and a casual listener won\u2019t notice that Peter played Albatross on a Stratocaster and not the Les Paul he was famed for using, but he noticed the difference for sure, and if it enabled him to create the number of options open to him are vital.

            "answer_text": "There are quite a variety on the market. Yes the basic two styles are single coil and double coil. Strats use single coil with wire around each magnet below each string and then the windings go around the entire pickup. Strats and Telecasters use similar single coil pickups but there are differences. The Gibson Epiphone P-90 only have windings around the magnets but there are twice as many windings. P-90\u2019s are found on Epiphone Casino, Riviera, and Wildkats hollowbody. Humbucking are twin coils where the first set of coils excite electricity in the second and this creates less hum and buzz. Also, the tone is more even with the twin coil humbucking pickups. Ovation back in the late 1970\u2019s created the first battery powered pickups that have more boost and are sometimes called noiseless. The we get to Gretsch who got beat to the Patent Office by Gibson. Gretsch uses are variety of styles of dual coil pickups, supertron, quiet tron, and Filter tron. George harrison played a Country Gentleman on the Ed Sullivan appearances and the front pickup is a supertron. There are some newer versions of silent single coil pickups available for Fender Guitars and some are battery powered. The silent style pickups have some downside as the tone is not so even. There are even tricks such as pouring wax over the windings on Fender Guitars, or putting tin foil inside the pickup opening on fenders to reduce the noise. Yes and there are still acoustic guitars another conversation. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, they all operate on the same principle, in so far as they're just coils of wire and magnets. There are subtle differences in the sounds produced by each type, but my experience is that there's not such a huge difference as to justify the sometimes huge costs of upgrading. What differences there are, are very subtle. I no longer worry about upgrading pickups unless they're faulty. Once you've runrun your guitar through a pedal or two and then into the amp, it's not always easy to see where the extra money went! I'll probably get flamed for this of course, but that's just my experience based on 30 years of playing guitars. Enjoy what you have and just play it! It's the law of diminishing returns again. Once you're above a certain level, you pay huge sums to get small improvements in sound. Even no less a guitar God than David Gilmour had stated that the importance of the guitar is overstated. He mantains that he could pick up any guitar and he would still sound like himself. I have no reason to disagree with that. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely not. The sound is affected by numerous factors. The two major designs are single coil and humbucker. Single coils generally sound brighter (\u201ctwang\u201d and \u201cchime\u201d are typical words being used to describe the sound) whereas humbuckers are more mellow, \u201cfat\u201d sounding. The number of windings also affect the sound. More windings render higher output and more midrange at the expense of the high end. The type of magnets used also affects the output and the sound. Ceramic and neodymium magnets produce a strong magnetic field and thus high output. Various kinds of Alnico magnets are used when a more vintage tone is desired. Other factors are how the winding is carried out (scattered, symmetric) the size and placement of the magnets and the coils, the type of wire used, if wax potting is used, type of cover and probably a few others I've forgotten. So as you can see, the pickup makers have quite a number of variables to play with, to create their own unique sound. ",

My guitar uses a Fishman Presys which is a pickup that takes sounds from the bridge. But there are many kind of acoustic guitar pickups out there. Soundhole pickup, magnetic pickup, et cetera.

My favorite for a long time was the Seymour Duncan Livewire Classic II (which falls under \u201cactive transducer\u201d type) based on sheer incredible magnitude of output. Unfortunately, I had to hide 9V batteries internally in my strat, which drained faster the longer and harder I played, since the mechanical action of manually generating up to six adjacent standing waves through picking strings creates an additional electrical load in this type of pickup circuit (imagine sucking sounds shriveling Duracells). I finally grew weary of this minus. ",

Pickups work like Piezo-Electric transducer converting vibrations from guitar to electrical signals. Single Coil Pickups: As the name suggests are single coiled.

It generally is a lot less noisy than single coil pickups. A humbucker with sustainer coils can give you longer sustained notes whereas a normal one would give you a normal tone. Fernandes makes a great Sustainer pickup. Seymour Duncan : Known for its amazing guitar pickups. EMG Series: The most sought after guitar pickups. Good ones are EMG 85,89 ( personal experience with EMG 85). Di-Marzio pickups: Stock pickups on Ibanez guitars. DMZ Pickups: Great pickups for Blues,Jazz and Metal ",
