            "answer_text": "I\u2019m in the same place as you are, except I\u2019m 2 years away from finding out whether I will make it or not, you have over 4 years, so for starters, consider yourself lucky. You have so much time, so much potential, that your potential chance of playing in a professional symphony orchestra is quite high, that is, if you practice enough. Your chances, I think, will be mostly shown after music college and which college will also be a decisive factor in it. I believe Juilliard, Curtis, Manhattan School of Music, Berkeley, and Eastman to be one of the top schools for music. My teacher has told me that going abroad, like to Helsinki Conservatory, London Conservatory, Vienna Conservatory, or at the top, Moscow Conservatory, is of the highest ranking in terms of musicianship and would make your chances of playing in some orchestra like the Berlin or Vienna or New York Philharmonic very high. So, it depends on what school you go to, but if you get into a good one, your chances will be good. You need to get past the fact that maybe you didn\u2019t practice that much before and realize you still have a huge chance as long as you commit; that\u2019s the biggest part. Many young musicians that played as kids/are highly talented don\u2019t end up becoming professional because they seek something else, or basically they just don\u2019t commit to the instrument. As long as you commit to practicing every day, you have a big chance of playing professionally. It is scary sometimes, to fear about not getting into the best school and then not making it into a good orchestra and being unsuccessful and having to play on the streets or something, but that\u2019s seriously the bottom of the barrel; like you have to be really bad to get that low. I still stress about it a lot, despite me reasoning this out right in front of myself. But I understand your worries, because like all events in this world, it\u2019s entirely possible, but then again, so is you becoming really successful too! Those who try hard, get to places, I think. don\u2019t quote me on that because I\u2019ve yet to find out hahaha. You can increase your chances by increasing your commitment. \u201cNever practice more than 4 hours a day\u201d -Itzhak Perlman. I try to practice 3\u20134 hours every day but that\u2019s really difficult and I get very little sleep doing this on top of school. Anyway, you must practice and do a lot of that. Another way to increase your chances is by connecting with musicians. This can be done by looking online, performing a lot, or talking to orchestra members. You should try to get connections, because not only does that let you have someone to practice with, but they can connect you with other people which could be helpful some day. I take any community event to perform so that I can talk to people and get to know them and make connections. I also talk to many members of my schools higher level orchestra, and with them, I was able to form a quartet and a chamber group to accompany me on one of my concerti. It\u2019s easy if you enjoy classical music (which you seem to) because it\u2019s fun to talk to others that can relate to music like you can and you can play with them. Anyway, please stop worrying, and start practicing!!! ",

            "answer_text": "The main difficulty in responding to your question is that, as the other excellent answers have suggested, there is no definite, objective way to sum up your \u201cchances\u201d. Becoming a professional orchestral musician is not the result of a fixed number of practice hours, study with a particular teacher, or even how early in life you decide to commit to that career path. Keep in mind the following truths: (1) the business is extremely competitive, especially at the highest levels, and there are no fail-safe paths to success; (2) an aspiring and even a working professional orchestral player can never stop practising and learning about her or his craft; (3) earning a full-time salary from professional orchestral playing alone is very often restricted to members of those top-level ensembles (very often nationally-recognized metropolitan orchestras). If you dream of playing professionally in an orchestra, you\u2019ll obviously need to draw up plans on how you\u2019re going to practise regularly, which teachers and training programs you\u2019re going to seek to study with, and how you\u2019re going to keep accumulating useful information from people who do play professionally to learn more about building your performing CV and your audition skills. To the extent that your time spent improving your performing skills is not compromised to any serious degree, I would also leave the door open to learning more about pedagogy, music theory, and other ancillary skills that you can turn into alternative streams of musical income. I do not enjoy a steady full-time salary from orchestral playing but I do support myself by blending that with chamber music, historical performance practice music, private teaching, church music ministry service, arranging and sheet music engraving, recording sessions, and even music theatre acting. Some of my friends and acquaintances do very well as full-time orchestral players but a much larger number of those in my circle are musical multi-taskers. You\u2019re thinking about important questions regarding your future career early in life so you have some time to sort through your options. Work seriously, systematically, and efficiently at your playing but leave a little room in your musical activities to grow outwards and diversify a bit, I\u2019d say. Those ancillary skills could be invaluable if and when your primary goal of becoming a full-time professional orchestra player isn\u2019t being realized quickly enough. ",
