            "answer_text": "Firstly, the question you have asked is quite confusing. Are you planning to buy an electric guitar, or an electric bass? Are you talking about chords on an acoustic guitar or an acoustic bass? Or is it a double bass you are talking about? Anyway, I'll assume you're talking about how chord shapes are a bit complex on any six string guitar. That includes both acoustic and electric guitars. A bass guitar, like the double bass, is fully tuned in fourths, starting from E1. So the tuning is E1-A1-D2-G2. Or you may have a five string, with the first string tuned to B0.  The first four strings of a six string guitar are tuned the same as they are in the bass, but an octave higher. So the tuning is: E2-A2-D3-G3. But the fifth string is different. It is tuned a major third above the G string, i.e. to B3. The last string is again tuned in fourths, to E4. The B3 string is what causes the weird chord shapes in the guitar. You can only move them vertically, not diagonally over the fretboard. This is because of the major third tuning of the fifth string. The bass has no such feature, since all strings are tuned the same. So chord shapes are the same all over the fretboard. But the bass isn't usually used to play chords anyway; when you play them in the first position (down the fretboard) they sound really muddy (due to beating) but not so much after the 12th fret. So if you're looking to play chords, I'd recommend learning the guitar, not the bass. If weird chord shapes is a problem with the guitar and you can't practice a lot, it's helpful to use all fourths tuning (by raising the B3 to a C4 and the E4 to an F4). The fretboard then becomes similar to a six string bass and chords remain the same everywhere. You'll have to adjust for tabs, though. I hope I helped with all of this stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have already said, it\u2019s possible to play chords on a bass but it\u2019s not the primary function. The 6 string rhythm guitar plays chords in time to the music. The bass plays notes that compliments those chords in a rhythmic pattern locked into the drum beat. It\u2019s the pulse of the music. I think it\u2019s more benifical to view the bass as a variable tone drum instead of a lower pitched guitar with 4 strings. That is more descriptive of its role. In order to be a successful bassist you need to understand how chords are formed and what bass notes sound good behind them. You also need to have a solid sense of rhythm and understand concepts like syncopation. You need the ability to improvise since the bass parts aren\u2019t always written down. That can be fun and challenging but it makes the song your very own. My point is the bass is an entirely different instrument than the guitar and it should be approached from the angle. I love being a bassist. My skills have been in demand since I was a teenager (40 some years ago) and I have had lots of fun being the anchor of many bands. I hope you give it a try. Good luck! ",
