            "answer_text": "No, you are not seeing the future. Or rather, it's highly unlikely since there has never been evidence that it could be done. And if it's never happened, is it really a memory? Or is it just a thought? The brain is probably the least understood part of any animal with one. IMO, If a song triggers a \u2018memory\u2019 or a \u2018thought' of something you haven't experienced, it's probably because some part of the song, the chord progression, the lyrics, the melody, etc., \u201chits a nerve\" as they call it. And thus, sets in motion a series of connected \u2018literal\u2019 memories that could possibly lead to a new idea or outcome. We don't yet understand how memories are stored and/or recalled. But I do know that some neuropathways are worn deeper than others. (Think of it like a map with memories being places and the neuropathways are the roads: some roads being just \u2018 dirt trails\u2019 and others being major highways) Simply put, a traumatic event is going to be remembered a lot more than something mundane or ordinary. As something mundane will rarely be recalled by the brain and therefore never establishing a pathway to it and is ultimately forgotten (the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 time) Whereas, an event that is significant, will have not only a well traveled highway (or two or three) to it, but will also have multiple paths to that memory. THEN, when you hear a song it could cross many different highways (recall multiple memories) that together, create an entirely new \u2018memory/though'. Or, you could just be crazy. LOL NO, I'M KIDDING! You're not crazy! Everyone has their own kinds of new thoughts, (an example being dreams) and their own way of producing them. ",

            "answer_text": "As I am not a clairvoyant , I can't speak to seeing/ hearing the future.  On an emotional level, I believe that some songs are in just the right key, or become popular at just the right time, to set up hopes or even expectations of future events. When a new boyfriend who was not a musical guy told me he liked Van Morrison's \u201cMoondance\u201d, I knew clear as day that we would marry; two years later we walked down the aisle. More mundane example: when I'm on hold on the phone and the music that plays is something I dislike, I usually get bad news. No, the library doesn't have that book. Your car will be in the shop for a couple of days. That prescription isn't due til tomorrow. Stuff like that. Bad music often foretell bad news. But it's likely all in our heads (pardon the expression). A part of our marvelous brains is giving us the expectation of unwanted news based on circumstance, then we associate the music (even the muzak) with the bad news. ",
