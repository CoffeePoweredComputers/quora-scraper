            "answer_text": "Never, really. A sellout implies a massive shift from their artistic roots just for the sake of gaining followers, and while their sound has changed, it\u2019s done so in a rather smooth manner. While they had an emo pop influence in the early days, they were fundamentally a pop punk band. They just went poppier as time went on, which is hardly unheard of for bands of the genre. While you can argue that they struck gold when they got MTV success and latched on to commercial success, there really is no period where you can point and say \u201cFOB abandoned their original spirit just to chase a trend\u201d.
