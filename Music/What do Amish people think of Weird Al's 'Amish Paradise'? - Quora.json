            "answer_text": "A2A Amish aren\u2019t supposed to watch videos/T.V./internet, so I doubt many have seen it. My Amish friends who have a sense of humor would probably think it is funny. My Amish friends who are challenged in the humor department just wouldn\u2019t get it. There are some Amish who would be offended by it, but poking fun at people is what Al does. I was surprised at how accurate it is. I am editing my answer, because my grown children tell me that most of their Amish friends have seen this video, whereas the over 30 years of age Amish that I know are not familiar with it. ",
