            "answer_text": "Want to hear a joke? The artist that helped me to get through the most difficult era of my life killed himself. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? Chester was an iconic singer and a role model; he inspired millions of kids and helped the solitary individuals who wanted to tell how they feel. He was idolized by singers from many genres. I was too confused; I had no idea how to react. Am I feeling betrayed? Or is it sadness? I barely checked out anything they had released post A Thousand Suns. I actually hated their last album \u2018One more light\u2019. It had a melancholic pop sound; maybe they had to keep up with the trend. I assumed they are writing about the same old defeated kid who is tired of screaming and embarked on a new way to express his bitterness; he has grown up now. I had no right to be sad. Guess I was disappointed. I wanted to hear the same sound from the band that I heard from them when I discovered them as a boy. It could have been a way for me to travel back in time. Surprisingly, deep down I believe I was angry too. It\u2019s like I believed in someone who didn\u2019t believe in himself. All those years I dedicated to Linkin Park seemed meaningless. I was on the verge of tears when I heard Chris Cornell passed away, I was not entirely his fan but his songs did touch me. I didn\u2019t go through the same emotion when I heard Chester hanged himself; I dedicated two years of my life listening to his voice. I was feeling empty when I heard the news. Maybe going through a void is worse than feeling sad; you feel something when you cry or when you are sad. I didn\u2019t feel a thing. The guy who sang \u201cI tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn\u2019t even matter\u201d Also sang \u201cHolding on To so much more than I can carry I keep dragging around what\u2019s bringing me down If I just let go, I\u2019d be set free Holding on Why is everything so heavy?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Chester reached out more lifes anyone could imagine. It was sad to hear the news he's gone, a feeling of denial was there at the moment as the heart wasn't ready to accept the fact. His lyrics were such a beautiful representation of what an individual goes through his/her life. His songs fits more vividly in life than anything else. \u201cWhy is everything so heavy, so much more than I can carry\u201d \u201cEverything you say to me Takes me one step closer to the edge And I'm about to break\u201d \u201cIt's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back. It's like a whirlwind inside of my head. It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within. It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin\u201d \u201cSometimes I think of letting go and never looking back and never moving forward so there'd never be a past.\u201d \u201cSometimes solutions aren't so simple, sometimes goodbye's the only way\u201d \u201cSo give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean, Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes, Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between, Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this New Divide\u201d And so much more of lyrics\u2026 Chester used to sing what people used to feel and the ways they used to feel. That's why we feel connected to music. You must not be able digest the news because he had such a great impact on your life, his songs used to explain you what you couldn't explain your self. You feel confused, lost, hurt, betrayed, failure, dream, negative , rejected , even if you can't name it, there's a song for that. That's the reason , also his new album was released last to last month and no one was expecting this. All of the songs are making sense now, how his own discography was his suicide note. He helped you through tough times and couldn't help himself through that. From Roads Untraveled we can judge that .. \u201cMay your love never ends and if you need a friend there's a seat here along side me\u201d To remember him , its good ,if you can remember what he said- \u201cWhen my time comes forget the wrong that I've done, HELP ME LEAVE BEHIND SOME REASONS TO BE MISSED, and don't resent me, when you're feeling empty keep me in your memory\u2026LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST, LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST\u201d Pray that he rest in peace ",
