            "answer_text": "It was never \u201cillegal\u201d to sing happy birthday in public. Let\u2019s put that out there. Prior to 2016, you could have sung \u201cHappy Birthday To You\u201d in public until you were blue in the face, as long as you paid Warner/Chappelle (a unit that once belonged to Warner Bros and now a unit of Warner Music Group) US$700 in a licensing fee per performance. This prompted many restaurants and public facilities to bypass that old song and write their own jaunty birthday tune. After a three-year trial, the Supreme Court declared \u201cHappy Birthday To You\u201d is in the public domain, meaning no one has control over the song nor will collect any royalties from it. So sing it until you turn blue in the face. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, here\u2019s the deal. Sing whatever you like anywhere you want. It\u2019s legal. What you can\u2019t do is sing a copyrighted song for money without paying the royalty. So, if you own a restaurant and you pay your staff to sing a song on a patron\u2019s birthday, then because money exchanges hands for this service as part of their job, they can\u2019t sing anything under copyright protection without paying the royalties. I believe the claim to the birthday song was also recently voided, so go ahead and sing it. Just please don\u2019t sing it at my table. ",
