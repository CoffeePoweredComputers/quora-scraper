            "answer_text": "All of the members of BLACKPINK fit the Korean beauty standards relatively well already! Of course, they are beautiful as they are. However, what would they look like if all their features were perfectly fitting to the visual standards? The Korean beauty standards represent what has been for a long time considered the ideal visual. They do not represent the thoughts and preferences of all Koreans, and some features that don\u2019t necessarily fit the standards are still considered desirable among the general populace. The beauty standards effectively create an outline for the \u201cperfect\u201d face. A small, symmetrical \u2018egg-shaped\u2019 face is ideal. An \u2018egg-shaped\u2019 face is a short, oval-shaped face that has a round forehead, a slim, v-line jaw and a small, pointed chin. The ideal ratio of a face is split horizontally into thirds, like so: from the top of the forehand to just beneath the eyebrows; from just beneath the eyebrows to the bottom of the nose tip; and from the bottom of the nose tip to the tip of the chin. The perfect eyes are large in size and have double eyelids. An in-out-line double eyelid is considered the most attractive. The perfect in-out-line double eyelids are like this: the eyelid fold is parallel to the lash line and meets it at the inner corner of the eye. The upper eyelid should be flat. A little aegyo-sal (puffy fat beneath the lower lash line) is considered to make you look more cute and youthful. An \u201ceye smile\u201d (where the eyes form two crescent moon shapes when you smile) is also a popular feature. Eyebrows should be neat and have a natural, gentle arch to them. The ideal nose is narrow and small in size. The nose bridge should be straight and slowly inclines to a point, neither too flat or high. The tip of the nose should be small and the ideal nasal angle is of approximately 80 degrees. The ideal mouth is petite with plump, upturned lips. The top lip should be slightly smaller than bottom lip, and the bottom lip doesn\u2019t protrude. Straight, white teeth are especially important. LISA Lisa has large, puppy eyes with asymmetrical out-line double eyelids. She has an upturned nose with asymmetrical nostrils, a wide nose bridge and wide alar base. Her lips are plump and have a defined cupid\u2019s bow. She has a small gonial angle and consequently a short and round jawline with a small chin.  The first thing that I changed was Lisa\u2019s nose, as this is her feature that is most obvious in not adhering to the beauty standards. I narrowed her alar base and created the appearance of a slightly lower and smaller nose tip. I also made her nose bridge appear higher and slimmer. Next, I altered her eyelids to be symmetrical and also appear \u201ctighter\u201d by making the crease look less deep. I made her inner corners more sharp and connected her eyelid creases to them in order to create in-out line double eyelids. I made her eye shape a little more upturned and corrected the slight droop of her eyelid around the inner corner of the left eye. I also changed her eyebrows and made them less arched. On her lips, I didn\u2019t change much, but made them a little more symmetrical. Finally, I edited her face shape. I made her chin pointier and created a v-line in her jaw shape by slimming down her gonial angle. I also softened the prominence of her cheekbones and altered her cheeks. ROS\u00c9 Ros\u00e9 has an oval-shaped face, with a small forehead, long, slim jawline and pointed chin. She has an upturned nose with a rounded tip, and very plump lips. Ros\u00e9\u2019s eyes are relatively small and she has in-line double eyelids.  For Ros\u00e9, the first thing I did was to change her facial proportions slightly. I did this by making her forehead larger, her face narrower, and placed her eyes wider apart. Next, I slimmed down her jawline and made her chin smaller, and also shrunk her cheeks a little. I refined the tip of her nose to be smaller and made it appear less upturned. Also, I slightly narrowed her alar base made her nose bridge appear a little higher. The final thing I did was to make sure that the nostrils were symmetrical. I made her mouth more symmetrical and a little smaller. For Ros\u00e9\u2019s eyes, I created in-out line double eyelids and made her epicanthic folds sharper. Then, I increased her eye size and elongated the outer corners. To finish off, I also added some aegyo-sal and slightly altered her eyebrows be straighter. JENNIE Jennie has a small, round face with slightly prominent cheekbones and very puffy cheeks. She has upturned \u201ccat eyes\u201d with soft epicanthic folds and out-line double eyelids. Jennie has a very small nose with a slight dorsal hump and she also has full lips.  The first thing I edited for Jennie was her face shape. I made her chin slightly longer and pointier and slimmed down her jawline. I also rounded off her cheekbones to create a more harmonious shape. I slimmed down her cheeks and made them appear less prominent by eliminating the droop of her lips at the outer corners. I also slightly decreased the size of her upper lip. For her nose, I reduced her dorsal hump and lifted the tip of her nose to be slightly higher and more upturned. I also made her nose bridge taller and more defined. Next, I altered her eyes to appear more bright and open by lifting the inner corners of her eyes. I then connected her eyelid to her epicanthic folds and made them sharper, so as to create in-out line double eyelids. I also gave her the appearance of more aegyo-sal. Finally, I made her eyebrows straighter and more tapered. JISOO Jisoo fits the Korean beauty standards almost perfectly already! She has in-out line double eyelids, a high nose bridge, small and plump lips, and a tapered face shape. She also has perfect facial proportions and great facial harmony.  For Jisoo, I only made minimal alterations. The first thing I did was refine her face shape to be more tapered. I slimmed down her gonial angle and ever so slightly reduced the appearance of her cheekbones. I then made her chin smaller and pointier. I also filled out the slight concave of her forehead. Next, I slimmed down Jisoo\u2019s nose bridge and alar base and made her nose tip a little smaller. I also corrected the slight asymmetrical tilt of Jisoo\u2019s alar base. Finally, I gave her more noticable aegyo-sal and made her eyebrows slimmer and straighter. What do you think of my edits? Thank you for reading! ",
