            "answer_text": "Technically, but it is a just a song title and it is most likely the line they will repeat in this song. It needs to flow well and \u201cI can't stop me\" just flows better than \u201cI can't stop myself.\u201d I would also note that there are other songs with the same title, such as the one sung by American singer Sabrina Carpenter, and so it wasn't a title created out of no knowledge for english grammar. A lot of songs are like this, especially in Kpop. Think of \u201cHow you like that\" by Blackpink. The more grammatical way to say this title would be \u201cHow do you like that\" but they chose this because it flows much better in the song. Hope this helped! ",

The word reflects on the action of the song, so if they are saying \u201cI can\u2019t stop me\u201d then they are saying they can\u2019t stop themselves\u201d Them may not be them (meaning they have to stop their actual self ,not them ; unless Jyp staff don\u2019t understand how to write in English)  ",
