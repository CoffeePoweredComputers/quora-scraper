            "answer_text": "One thing can be said about Elvis\u2019 time on the Army: after that, he was never the same, anymore.  Elvis Presley gets his hair cut before entering the Army at Fort Chaffee in Barling, Ark., in March 1958. While Elvis Presley was the King, he was also a sergeant. His service didn\u2019t last long, but it forever changed him. He served dutifully, but it was also a dark period in his life during which he lost his mother and began the grim journey of drug addiction that likely ended his life.  First things first: Elvis didn\u2019t exactly join the Army: he was drafted. But unlike many wealthy/influential people, he did not wheedle or otherwise try to get out of his obligation, but promptly reported for training. When Elvis was drafted into the Army in 1957, questions abounded: Could the most famous person in the United States be useful or would he just get in the way? What if he traveled and entertained the troops instead? Would he have to lose his awesome haircut that stole the hearts of so many young women? Various branches of the armed services offered him cushy jobs. The Navy suggested creating an \u201cElvis Presley company\u201d composed of his friends from Memphis, and the Air Force wanted to use him as a recruiting model rather than sending him into combat. The Army offered to have him only play concerts for the troops.  Presley chose to serve as a regular soldier. \u201cPeople were expecting me to mess up, to goof up in one way or another. They thought I couldn\u2019t take it and so forth, and I was determined to go to any limits to prove otherwise. Not only to the people who were wondering but to myself,\u201d he later said of his decision. His service began at what was arguably the height of his career on March 24, 1958, a day dubbed by the media as \u201cBlack Monday.\u201d He was soon deployed with an armored division near Frankfurt, Germany, as a truck driver for an officer named Capt. Russell. Having begun his working life as a truck driver, Elvis was back where he started. It wasn\u2019t a walk in the park for his officers. Women tailed Elvis wherever he went. The company\u2019s mail went from one bag a day to 15, and German girls tried to climb the base\u2019s fence to lay their eyes on the singer.  Young fans of Elvis Presley try to get closer to their hero in Germany on Oct. 1, 1958. So his officer decided to transfer Elvis to a scout platoon led by Sgt. Ira Jones, a man that wouldn\u2019t take any junk from anybody. If they wanted to keep the media away from Elvis, Sgt. Ira Jones was the guy who could do it. But his hair? Despite efforts from Sen. Clifford P. Case of New Jersey to save the iconic hairdo, it really had to go.  Poor Elvis. In August 1958, Elvis\u2019s mother, Gladys Presley, died of a heart attack, and he went home to Memphis for the funeral. He would later call her death \u201cthe great tragedy of his life.\u201d When he returned to Germany from her funeral, Elvis served alongside his fellow soldiers, eventually being promoted to sergeant. But he partied as well, taking his Army buddies on wild, debaucherous trips across Europe. During this time, a fellow sergeant introduced Elvis to amphetamines, which he began taking almost daily. Elvis would say at the time that \u201cthese little pills will give you more strength and energy than you can imagine. It was better to take the pill with coffee, because the hot coffee and caffeine would tend to make the pill work a lot quicker.\u201d Later, he would even say that \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have them, I\u2019d never make it through the day myself. But it\u2019s okay, they\u2019re safe.\u201d  Upon his return, Elvis continued producing hits \u2014 such as \u201cAre You Lonesome Tonight?\u201d \u201cSurrender,\u201d \u201cReturn to Sender,\u201d \u201cCrying In The Chapel\u201d and \u201cSuspicious Minds\u201d\u2014 but a new breed of rock band began to eclipse him. Rock-and-roll tastes had changed dramatically in his absence. It\u2019s impossible to predict what Elvis\u2019s career might have been if he hadn\u2019t taken the two-year hiatus in the service. His mother still would have died unexpectedly. He still may have discovered the immediate pleasures and long-term destruction of drugs. He might even have slipped out of public view more quickly than he did. His time in Germany may not have directly led him to the sad, paranoid, drug-addled ending that came when he died on a toilet. Lots of stars had serious drug problems. But it\u2019s difficult not to wonder.

            "answer_text": "This is by far the best question I\u2019ve had the opportunity to answer. The short answer is a resounding YES! The long answer, of course, is far more in depth. Here are the highlights, but I\u2019ve linked, at the bottom, the full story of one man\u2019s perspective of Elvis Presley\u2019s life in the Army. According to Mr. Bill \u201cNervous\u201d Norvell, a very good friend of mine and, for a while, Elvis\u2019 too\u2014Presley was a soldier just like any other.  Above: Bill \u201cNervous\u201d Norvell January 2020 Norvell and Presley were together in the Army from their swearing in until the two went to Germany. Norvell had the opportunity to spy on Presley for publications but didn\u2019t take it. He even told Presley he was contacted about doing that. I think, that\u2019s one of the reasons the two hit it off so well during their time together. Getting to interview Norvell was amazing not just because he was good friends with Presley in the Army but also because he could tell stories like nobody\u2019s business. He will tell anyone that\u2019ll listen that Elvis had to do exactly what he did during their time at Fort Hood. The two cleaned trashcans together and took leave off base as much as they could. Heck Presley brought Norvell\u2019s wife to Texas one weekend so that Presley\u2019s girlfriend at the time could come too (Anita Wood). Yes, Elvis Presley was a good soldier during his time in the Army. Yes, he did get a few special exceptions but those who were right there with him were pretty okay with that. There were some instances where Presley made sure that everyone in his barracks had what he had. He actually bought everyone the same supplies so they all looked the same when it came to inspections. One thing that really stuck with me while talking with Norvell was how much Presley appreciated his fans. He thought of them like they were all his friends. After one particular incident, where they narrowly escaped a movie theater not completely intact, Presley asked Norvell why his friends would tear after him like that. They had ruined his favorite jacket by grabbing at him. It\u2019s instances like that where I know Elvis Presley was a good person not just a good soldier. He really did care about people\u2014especially all his friends. There are two things Norvell still has from Presley, a watch inscribed to Norvell from Presley and one of Presley\u2019s sweaters. Norvell never profited from Elvis and he said he\u2019s certainly not going to now. Everything he got from Elvis was from the goodness of the King of Rock and Rolls heart.
