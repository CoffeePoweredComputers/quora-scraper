            "answer_text": "I listen to hyped up songs with a lot of bass and drops because it feels satisfying. Generally, people like listening to heavy metal when in rage. But I don't really like listening to heavy metal. So, I can't guarantee you will like that but I will still suggest some - Far too Loud - Lightbringer  MISSIO - Bottom of the deep blue sea  Illenium - Pray  Well, there are not that great but it's all I can think of. Sorry for the bad choice. I'll add more when I remember. Toodles, Umaiza. ",
