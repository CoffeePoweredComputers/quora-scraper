            "answer_text": "Yes. But, be careful to actually play an ukulele C chord on your ukulele. If your ukulele is tuned the standard way, C-G-E-A, then the fingering is 0003, which looks like this: \u2564\u2564\u2564\u2564 1\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 \u253c\u253c\u253c\u2524 2\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 \u253c\u253c\u253c\u2524 3\u2502\u2502\u2502\u25a0 \u253c\u253c\u253c\u2524 The reason I\u2019m explaining this so thoroughly is that ukulele learners can succumb to the \u201clittle guitar\u201d delusion and try to use guitar chord diagrams to shape ukulele chords. (It doesn\u2019t work.) This is tempting because, well, it\u2019s half true. An ukulele is tuned with the same intervals as the four higher pitched strings of a guitar. However, all four strings are tuned a perfect fourth (five frets) higher on an ukulele (G-C-E-A) than the corresponding strings on a guitar (D-G-B-E). So, relative to each other, ukulele strings are the same as guitar strings, but sound different pitches than the guitar. The parallel organization of the two instruments is further demonstrated by the trick to convert a guitar into a simulated ukulele. If you put a capo on at the fifth fret of your guitar, you instantly have a six-string ukulele. I employ this gag frequently to play Hawaiian songs. To sound totally authentic, I\u2019ll not play the 5th (A) and 6th (E) strings, now tuned with the capo to D and A respectively. If I get the strum right, it\u2019s hard to tell the difference by just listening. The point of telling ukulele players about my guitar qua ukulele gag is to explain what I have to do differently to play a song in the same key as other people playing guitars, but without a capo applied. I have to form ukulele chords on my guitar. Since the strings are tuned differently with the capo on, I can\u2019t use the same fingering shapes I normally use on a guitar. I have to use hand shapes that yield the same tones, or octaves above, as a guitar without a capo. Fortunately, there is a regular, systematic way to do this. In fact, it\u2019s so simple that for simple songs without a lot of fast chord changes, I can do this \u201con the fly\u201d, that is, looking at a lead sheet for guitar and playing the ukulele chords. Ukulele players can do this, too, but the mental process is different from mine. An ukulele player has it a lot easier. They ignore any guitar fingering diagrams and look at the name of the chord. If, as in your example, the chord to play is C major, they think, \u201cI know how to play a C chord; it\u2019s 0003.\u201d Done. The guitar players without capos think, \u201cI know how to play a C chord; it\u2019s 032010.\u201d And, they are done, too. They can look at a diagram if they haven\u2019t learned it by rote. The fake ukulele/guitar player has to do an extra step, but can also quickly figure out where to place his/her fingers. It goes like this: \u201cC is the 4th above G; the guitar fingering for G is 320003.\u201d Notice that the fingering for the guitar\u2019s G chord is 320003. The four highest pitched strings use the same fingering as the ukulele\u2019s C chord. By playing the fingering for the chord a 5th below on a guitar, I end up playing the same fingering as the ukulele player playing a real ukulele. I have to do this extra step because, as a guitar player, I have not memorized ukulele chord fingerings. Until I do, I\u2019ll have to transpose in my head like that. Of course, I can make it easier for myself with another gag. When playing a song with my capo 5, fake ukulele, I can use a guitar lead sheet for the same song set in a key a 5th above (or below - it\u2019s the same thing) the regular guitar lead sheet. I use this ruse all the time to play the Somewhere Over the Rainbow/It\u2019s a Wonderful World medley made famous by Israel Kamakiwo\u2019ole. It\u2019s in C, but I made a G version for this special purpose. I gave you this long and seemingly unrelated answer to attempt to give you the \u201cbig picture\u201d about what\u2019s going on between guitars and ukuleles. Your question suggested that you are not exactly clear about that topic. I have both guitar and ukulele players in my weekly music circle and we\u2019re always getting into this kind of discussion to explain how to play equivalent guitar chords on an ukulele or vice versa. I\u2019ve found that once one understands the \u201c4th above/5th below\u201d relationship between the two instruments, questions about why we use different fingerings to play the same chord go away.

            "answer_text": "Well yes. If there's a song you like to sing and strum your guitar along with, you could accompany yourself by playing the same chords on a ukulele instead - or a piano, or a harp, or any instrument that plays chords. How you play these chords would of course be different for each instrument, though, and not every instrument works for every song. If there's a song someone has written to have both guitar and ukulele playing simultaneously, there is of course no rule that says that both instruments must be playing the same chord at any given time. It's up to the composer to decide what instrument plays what, when. ",
