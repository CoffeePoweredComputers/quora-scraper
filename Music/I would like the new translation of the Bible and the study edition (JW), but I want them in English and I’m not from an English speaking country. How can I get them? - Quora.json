            "answer_text": "Two persons have given you the two ways that you can obtain a NWT bible. I cannot add anything else to their comments. As for the validity of the NWT: Critics of the New World Translation have stated that this Bible version was produced to support Jehovah's Witness beliefs. They ignore the fact that all of these beliefs were arrived at using the 1611 King James Bible and other early translations, long before the concept of a new bible translation was conceived. In 1946 the Bible and Watchtower Society realizing the wealth of early manuscripts and scrolls available since the original KJV was translated, using the Tyndale and Wycliffe Bibles as well as the Text Receptus and the Masoretic Texts, decided to re-translate the Bible from \u201cscratch\u201d. They began the monumental task of re-translating the scriptures using ALL the material now available and not restricting themselves to just re-copying an older bible version. Virtually all of this material used did NOT require translation as word for word interlinear translations were available for most of this material. Fredrick Franz was fluent in both Hebrew and Greek if and when such was required. \u201cVersed in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, Mr. Franz published many translations. He traveled extensively, addressing audiences around the globe, often reciting large portions of the Bible without notes.\u201d Frederick W. Franz, A Religous Leader, Dies in Office at 99 (Published 1992) This was done word by word, verse by verse with NO referral to any previous Bible version cross checking and comparing with all the material available to get the most accurate rendering of each verse as noted in all the newly discovered material since 1611 as well as the material used for the KJV translation. The 2013 New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures is the culmination of over 60 years of effort in producing the most accurate and readable Bible based on ALL the scriptural material, manuscripts, scrolls, etc, available. It is NOT a recopy of any other bible version. It removes and corrects translation errors in other versions (as determined from the original writings) and is rendered in modern language and vocabulary rather than archaic and difficult to understand Shakespearean English. It has been vilified and denounced by other bible version advocates as being a misrepresentation of the \u201ctrue\u201d scriptures in their eyes. They continue to support their version as the only \u201ctrue\u201d bible. They erroneously state that this is the Jehovah\u2019s Witness bible and that it was translated to \u201csupport\u201d their beliefs. For anyone who is interested the New World Translation can be downloaded in anyone\u2019s choice of language at http://JW.ORG. There is NO CHARGE for this Bible. ",

You can go to JW.ORG, click on the CONTACT US tab at the bottom of the page, and find the relevant telephone number or address. At present the Study Bible is still under development. The online version is constantly being updated. Only the four gospels and the book of Acts are sufficiently complete to be issued as the first volume of the printed edition. I have no idea how many volumes it will take to make up the full set when this version is completed. ",
