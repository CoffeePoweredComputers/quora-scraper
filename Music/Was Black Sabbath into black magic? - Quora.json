            "answer_text": "I recall in my teenage years having a profound fascination with the fact That jimmy page of Led Zeppelin had purchased aleister crowley\u2019s mansion boleskin house on Loch Ness. Rumours were that Crowley was a magick enthusiast and had an awakening to try to find his holy guardian angel which is supposed to be within all of us. However there was a ritual to be performed to summon all the demons and dark energy and bring them to face you fully and be seen. Then the holy guardian angel within would rise up and command control over these dark forces and the light of the guardian angel could then rule the dark spirits. I believe the myth that shrouded these practices were interpreted as to be summoning the dark forces and the allure of this mystical occultism in the late 60\u2019s and early \u201870\u2019s new music influence captured the uk heavy metal bands like led zeppelin and black sabbath and jimmy page and tony iommi. They may have attempted to carry on practising what Crowley had started but didn\u2019t completely fulfill the entire ritual led to the darkness and supposedly Iommi had been taken over by these forces which gave him the dark power projected in his tranced guitar playing and effect it had on those who listened. later led zeppelin was rehearsing for the upcoming tour for the ninth album , John bonzo bonham died In September 1980 in Jimmy page\u2019s home he succumbed by chocking on his own vomit from overconsumption of vodka in the early morning . Adding more ominous mystery between Crowely and the uk guitar rock gods of the 70\u2019s and misfortunes and mishaps that followed those that followed crowley. ",
