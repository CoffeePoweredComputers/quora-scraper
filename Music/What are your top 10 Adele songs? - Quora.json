            "answer_text": "My favorite song by Adele is Chasing Pavements and One and Only. Chasing Pavements is a masterpiece and it\u2019s so meaningful to me. It\u2019s about not being able to change your current state of affairs neither state of mind. You gotta either walk away from a nasty relationship or keep chasing pavements, running in a cycle. Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements even if it leads nowhere. Would it be a waste even if I knew my place, should I leave it there? One and Only is the song of a happy future with a potential boyfriend. It is the hopeful song of fancying someone and the possibility of him loving you back. I dare you to let me be your one and only. I promise I\u2019m worthy to hold in your arms. Come on, give me the chance. And then there is underrated Turning Tables from the album 21. It\u2019s legendary. Close enough to start a warAll that I have is on the floorGod only knows what we're fighting forAll that I say, you always say more I\u2019m not in a relationship now but I get the feeling from which Adele sings the song, especially when she sings it live.  Adele 2011, the hands are always wide open as to destroy the real frustration depicted in the song This song is based on Adele\u2019s relationship with an actual manipulative boyfriend. When you listen to it, you can feel that Adele is sick of living in the shadow of her boyfriend and she is determined to leave him. First, there is confession of sorrow and then she promises herself and declares the lover that she will rise from the pain and will come out as a stronger person. She says \u2018I gave up on you and your games. Now I\u2019m going to be my own savior without needing you. I\u2019m better now\u2019. Under haunted skies I see you Where love is lost your ghost is foundI braved a hundred storms to leave youAs hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down  Adele said somewhere that shortly after singing it to her then-boyfriend whom the song is about, they immediately broke up. We should do this song justice by streaming it more on Spotify or Fizy. By understanding its pure beauty. Adele, your voice is sweet like a candy as much as it is soothing. Thank you babe for being the remedy of my nights with your pure aesthetically-pleasing-to-hear voice. Finally, please listen to the rendition of the song at Royal Albert Hall:  ",
