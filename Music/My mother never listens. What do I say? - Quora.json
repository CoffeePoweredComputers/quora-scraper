            "answer_text": "I don't know how old you are but I am 33 and in my experience, my mom has never listened to me. It is kind of funny because when she goes back and thinks about it in the future, she always realizes I was right. Since my dad died when I was 19, she has never wanted to be alone. She has dated guy after guy. I have given her advice on these guys and told her what I thought about them. And I have yet to be wrong about one. The best one she probably ever had was her last long term relationship. I can sort of see why she ended it but I do think he cared about her. He just left her with a lot of his responsibilities financially while he went for a supposedly short visit with his family on the west coast and he refused to help her out with any money. Said if he wasn't staying there he didn't need to be paying any of the bills, although his personal belongings were all there and he intended to come back. So yeah that sucks and I agree it wasn't right. But\u2026. They broke up last year. She met a new guy in February. They went out like once before he literally came to her house and never left. At first he seemed really nice and I told her i thought he seemed like a good guy. I shortly realized he was a complete and total psychopath. And it didn't take long to realize. I tried to gently break it to her but she made all sorts of excuses\u2026 It's his anxiety\u2026that was her biggest excuse. I told her, gently once again, I'm pretty sure he is an untreated paranoid schizophrenic. But he was completely off the wall. I found out lots of things about him that I could not bring myself to tell her because I knew she would be hurt badly. For instance he cheats on her\u2026both with males and females! She would be crushed to find out either of those things. I should have told her, but he carries a loaded gun all the time and I was truly afraid he was going to end up using it. He was always pointing his gun at his head and if he wasn't doing that he was making threats to end someone else's life. I was always walking on eggshells around him. It was terrible. And he ended up convincing her that me and my husband were doing things we weren't. I suspect that this was because he had told both of us way too much. I think he became afraid once he realized how much he had revealed to her and thought how do I get rid of them? And then jumped at the first opportunity. I should have told her beforehand because she wouldn't listen to me after he got inside her head and had her listening to all this stuff that was not true. Nothing I can do about it now. But my mom has always thought that when it comes to life decisions she's the authority. She doesn't ever stop to think how I have always looked out for her and had her best interests in mind. I have always given her my honest opinion of things. She just always thinks that she knows it all. When it comes to book smarts she's always listened to me but not common sense. She acts like I'm a complete and utter failure but refuses to admit that all my recent failures in life have been because she has held me back. For instance, she's taken so much money from me that it has put me in a situation where I have had to be dependent on her. She's the type of person that will say I wish you were not here so I can have my house to myself\u2026.And then when you get a bunch of money and you're going to rent your own place, she has her hand out saying I need to pay bills and you owe me money because I have let you stay with me. Yet she would take money we gave her and keep it and then call and have her mom pay her bills\u2026money which she didn't have to pay back, either. I can't tell you how many times I have gotten quite a bit of money like from student loans etc and she has chastised me saying I don't know how to manage money and has bummed literally almost every penny from me. I was going to buy myself a cheap car last year and she threatened to throw me out unless I signed my financial aid check over to her. She said she had to keep the money for me because I would blow it all in a day or two. Guess who didn't buy a car? Me because she spent every penny except for a few hundred which I demanded be spent on school clothes for my kids. Yeah it's all pretty damn ridiculous really. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, to start with how old are you? A teenager? Or an adult? Over the age of 18. Do you work? Or Go to school? Say a comminity college? If you are an adult, do you live at home with your mom? Or do you have your own apartment? Do you have your own car? Are you responsible for yourself? Buy and cook your own food. Do your own laundry? Are you a responsible individual? Or, do you stay at home? Do nothing, this is not healthy. You should be helping your mom, in any way, in every way possible. Paying her a rent, for the food she cooks for you, and maybe the laundry she does for you. Your mom waits on you, makes sure everything is going okay for you? If this is the situation, no wonder she does not listen to you. Can you see what I'm saying? See my points of view? I am not trying to hurt your feelings, or make you feel bad. I'm merely trying to show you how your mom might feel. If you are dead wooden, lay around, watch TV all day, eat, sleep, drink coffee. Or some beverage, non\u2019alcoholic, and do not contribute to the house, because you are not working, no wonder that she doesn't listen to you.. Take this into consideration. .you need to be a helper, not some one that hurts and does nothing. ",
