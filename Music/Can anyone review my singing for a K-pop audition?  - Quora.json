            "answer_text": "I just finished listening to it ^^ My review is- You have a clear voice, making it easy to make out the words you\u2019re saying, which is amazing! Although I have to say, if it feels like you\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on your vocals, do not try and exceed further. It will strain and will cause breaks when singing. Practice makes better! I believe you have a wonderful voice and hope you will continue singing! I advise, if you\u2019d like more control of your nice voice you should see a professional vocal coach to help you do that. They will also help you put less pressure on your vocals and help you sing deeper more refined notes as well. You do have a good control over your voice, but sometimes when people sing higher the less control they have. I read in the comments that you don\u2019t have a vocal coach, so I recommend finding one! To help with tone, control, and pressure control. I know you\u2019ll do great in the entertainment industry! I hope you found this useful! ^^ ",
