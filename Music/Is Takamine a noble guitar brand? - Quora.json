            "answer_text": "I own a Takamine guitar and the definitely have some great technical inovations for live performance. Give a listen to this song recorded on a Takamine and a Gibson. The lead guitar is all Takamine and the song was live recorded one take. Kaman also had some ownership in Takamine. Kaman also started making Ovation Guitars in 1966. Takamine split the pickup and the saddle design to really improve the pa and recorded sound. My Takamine is from around 2008. Takamine developed what they call a cold tube technology that uses a vacuum tube in the preamplifier to improve the live and recorded sound. Another feature is lazer cut inlay. My Takamine has paduka wood inlay as well as what appears to be gold leaf inlay. As Takamine started in Japan in 1962 they had to compete with American Musicians that like American made guitars, and yes I am one of those musicians. However, I got a deal on the Takamine and did not realize just how impressive this guitar is compared to my Gibson, which uses the RL Baggs pickup. As Takamine are made in Japan the labor costs are about equal to a Gibson. So to answer your question a $2K-$3K Takamine is a great instrument for a professional musician or just an advanced player wanting a fine guitar sitting in a case in the bedroom. Actually my guitars are sitting on stands in my music room ready to play.  ",

            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t normally think of guitars or guitar brands as being \u201cnoble\u201d\u2026. Takimine has been making instruments for years and they are generally well-received. They did run into a bit of trouble back in the 70s with their \u201cLawsuit\u201d guitars\u2026. They were producing copies of famous acoustic instruments\u2026 Martin, Guild, Gibson. They even contrived to make the headstock logo look as much as possible as the other brands while still saying \u201cTakamine\u201d. For instance:  Looks pretty much like the \u201cMartin\u201d logo, no? But they quit making such instruments after being threatened with copyright lawsuits from all these firms and have evidently cleaned up their act. ",
