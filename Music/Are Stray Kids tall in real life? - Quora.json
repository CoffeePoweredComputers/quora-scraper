            "answer_text": "Actually, as a Kpop boygroup, they\u2019re one of, if not, the shortest active boy group in terms of average height. May sound weird, but I did calculate this before for a different question. Though Stray Kids don't have their official heights listed, based on \"fan compiled\" listings on Kprofiles, their average height is 172cm. Again it may not be accurate since some male idols have a tendency to grow after debut and all of Stray Kids heights were fan compiled. The average Korean men\u2019s height is 175.3cm so they\u2019re average is slightly below average. This is a video compilation someone made of Stray Kids next to other groups  ",

Never met them in my life before but I\u2019m sure most of them are shorter than me. Except maybe I.N and Lee Know (171 and 172?? CMIIW), their height is almost same to mine. So in my perception, stray kids in average is short. It depends on your height because talking about height is a matter of perception. I\u2019m sorry english is not my mother language. ",
