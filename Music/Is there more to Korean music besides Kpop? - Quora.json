            "answer_text": "With K-pop expanding globally so quickly, K-pop is now becoming a sort of umbrella term for all different genres of Korean music, including K-Hiphop and R\u2019n\u2019B/Indie music. R\u2019n\u2019B and Indie music is often used as OSTs in Korean dramas, so they often get lots of popularity. Some of the most well-known artists that fall in this category include Crush, Zion.T, Dean, Suran, G.Soul and Joo Young who are the more well-known ones. Some of the less well-known ones but equally talented include Roydo, C-Luv, Miso, D.meanor and more. On the other hand, there is K-Hiphop which is rapidly gaining recognition, especially among fans in their early 20s. Some of the well-known rappers include Jay Park, Dok2, Tiger JK (legendary), Yoon Mirae and Jessi. I think one of the main reasons it\u2019s getting so much popularity lately could be the popularity of competitive shows like Show Me The Money and Unpretty Rapstar (with a great line up of producers AND competitors for the new upcoming season of Show Me The Money). Looking at an older audience, trot music has always been quite popular among adults, largely the elderly. Songs like \u201cNot An Easy Girl\u201d by After School\u2019s Lizzy, or \u201cUnconditional\u201d by Park Sang Chu always seem to be a hit among the older population of Korea. A well known artist that I enjoy listening to would be Hong Jin Young. What I\u2019m trying to say is that, of course there\u2019s plenty of music for everyone beyond the mainstream K-pop music that one is first exposed to. It may not be as popular as K-pop, but it\u2019s certainly enjoyable! ",

            "answer_text": "Of-bloody-course we have music more than kpop. I actually resent them for drowning out other genres. KRock and Indie for example. Guckkasten and Jannabi are among the k rock/indie genres that managed to become popular. There\u2019s also the classic k folk/country songs. Kim Guang Suk\u2019s known as \u201cthe singing poet\u201d. His songs are absolutely beautiful and heart wrenching. We have as many genres as other countries have. ",
