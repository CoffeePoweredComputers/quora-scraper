            "answer_text": "If I knew the answer to that I\u2019d be a millionaire by now. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t happen with a lot of work and investment and luck. Pick your absolute best most commercially viable song. Assuming you\u2019re more of a writer than a singer find a wonderfully talented singer or band that is A) looking for new material and B) has a style that fits with your song. By \u201cfit\u201d I mean, if you\u2019ve found a rapper but your song leans more toward country, that\u2019s not a fit. Enter an agreement with your new found talent whereby you will supply the song and pay for the recording and the video and they will provide the talent. Finding the talent will be the hard part. Getting them to agree to your deal will be the easy part. There are pros and cons as to whether to go with a band or a solo artist. The pros of working with a band are that they are a complete unit, you won\u2019t have to hire any other musicians. The cons are that typically in a band each member has his/her own interpretation of the music and/or his/her own importance to the band as a whole. There can be a lot of very sensitive egos involved. Each member will have their own input and suggestions and may get upset if their suggestions aren\u2019t followed. However, if you find that you have the patience and temperament to get through this phase, get a finished product, and with the band still together and all working together then you might find that you could be a successful manager, taking 10\u201315% of the band\u2019s earnings. The cons of working with a solo artist are that you have to find and organize other musicians for the recording. However, the pros being that you have only one personality, one ego to contend with. So it\u2019s a trade off. Whether you\u2019re dealing with a band or a solo artist you will have to find some place and time to rehearse. The band might already have a rehearsal space if you\u2019re lucky. Having all the singers and musicians together in one space you\u2019ll need to come up with an arrangement. If you are an experienced musician this might come easy to you. But it\u2019s not a bad idea to ask for input from each instrumentalist to some extent. They will always appreciate that. However, even if you have very specific ideas about an arrangement, still make sure to leave room for individual creativity. By that I mean, for example, you know where in the song you want a guitar solo. You won\u2019t have to tell him what notes to play, he can figure that from the chord progression of the song. But you can make suggestions as to style (is it more like Eddie Van Halen or more like Chuck Berry) and volume. Other than that give them as much freedom as you feel comfortable with. Once you have worked out an arrangement and have rehearsed it to near perfection then you\u2019re ready to go into a studio. Two things to note here. By now you should know what kind of drummer you\u2019re dealing with. If he/she tight as a metronome or does he tend more toward following the bass player? If he\u2019s tight then don\u2019t worry about it. But if he\u2019s \u201ciffy\u201d then have him practice on his own with a metronome or click track. A click track is a steady beat clicking along with the recording. If you don\u2019t practice playing to one you\u2019ll never be able to stay with it. It\u2019s that simple. Find the tempo that works best for the song and make sure he practices his butt off to that click track. That accomplished, find a studio. This is not as difficult as it was when i was doing this back in the 80s. Everybody and their dog has a laptop with protools on is and a couple of mics. These guys are not necessarily the ones you want but you never know, you might be surprised. Go online and google recording studios in your area. You can still find them on craigslist. You will find quite a variety of levels and prices. Depending on where you live you can find studios from $15 up to $150 an hour or more. I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re not ready to spend $150 and hour. But you can get quality for about $30 and hour if you book a block of ten hours or more. If you live in the Los Angeles area there\u2019s nothing better I\u2019ve found at any price than Big Scary Tree Studios in Sunland. Call around, ask for pricing and ask for to hear samples. If they don\u2019t have sample you might want to move on to the next one. It means they either haven\u2019t been in business long or they have never recorded anything they\u2019re proud enough to show. Some will actually have samples that aren\u2019t impressive so, you\u2019re sort of on your own to find the best studio for your budget. Talk to the engineer and make sure he has experience recording your kind of music. Sometimes you can discern this based on the ad they post online. For example if he\u2019s talking about recording \u201cbeats\u201d he probably doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience recording disco, and vice versa. Depending on how tight your band is at this point you might need about 10 hours of studio time for recording basic tracks. Basic tracks would be most of the instruments, not including the vocal and any overdubs. Once you have the basic tracks finished then you begin work on the lead vocal. If your singer is good you can get this done in a couple hours at most, including backing vocals if necessary. Once this is done you\u2019ll need about 4 or 5 hours for mixing. Maybe less if it\u2019s a simple arrangement. Once you have a mix that you love you\u2019ll need to get it mastered. Your recording engineer might know someone who can do this. If he\u2019s honest he\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s not his forte. Mastering is a whole different animal than recording and mixing. It\u2019s really an art form. Once you have your recording mastered then your ready to shoot a video. Go back to google or craigslist and find a music video producer/director. You\u2019ll find these the same way you found your studio. Again, ask to see samples. If you have ideas about how you want the video to go then look for a producer who is willing to incorporate your ideas. But some of these guys think they\u2019re the next Spielberg so you might have to deal with his ego. I don\u2019t know what to tell you about that. make sure that his shooting and editing are all included in his price. And make sure that he puts a credit at the end, listing the song, artist and composer. Now you have the finished video. Create a channel of youtube. You\u2019ll have to do some research into how monetisation works because i\u2019m not that familiar with it. Upload the video and send a link to everyone who worked on it in anyway shape or form. If it goes viral then you\u2019re on your way. Keep close ties to everyone you worked with so you can start the whole process over again as soon as possible. As you can see it\u2019s going to take an investment of a lot of time, effort and money. But nothing worthwhile is easy. Good luck ",
