            "answer_text": "Depends. It's much more convenient to buy music digitally on itunes. For new releases, it's cheaper to buy it on iTunes than in a store. Take Linkin Park's new album, \"The Hunting Party\". It was $10.99 on iTunes the day it came out (has been $7.99 on and off for sale purposes since), yet stores are trying to charge $17 for it.  Then look at older releases. AC/DC's \"Highway to Hell\" is $9.99 on iTunes, but I bought it for $4.99 at a local music store, brand new in the wrapping and then I imported it to iTunes. I don't know about your local music store, but mine is very nice. They have a bargain section (prices ranging $1-$3) and through buying those over the past year (some 100 cds) I have probably saved over $1,000 buying physical CDs instead of digital albums (even if the cd case isn't all that nice, the cd still works).  I would recommend physical copies, although the only downside is they take up space. Although buying music on iTunes takes up more cpu space than imported cd music does.  Even going to a non-music store that sells cds (walmart, target, some book/electronic stores) you can save some money. A lot of cds will be priced $5 or $7 that are actually $9.99 on itunes. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think it's necessarily the VALUE, but the convenience. I started with LPs back in the day, graduated to cassettes, then CDs around 1988, and a few years ago I realized I rarely do anything with a CD anymore but rip it and listen to the high quality mp3, whether in my car on a thumb drive, iPod, desktop computer - whatever. I almost never used the CD. The bulk of them were boxed up in the attic from my last move. I started buying digital only. Amazon or iTunes, mostly - whichever had the better deal or offered more interesting bonus tracks.  I have no regrets. That said, recently an album was available on Amazon with \"AutoRip,\" where you can immediately download the MP3, but they send you the physical CD in the mail. Got my music right away, and for no additional cost the CD arrived at my house 2 days later (Amazon Prime rules!).  It was nice to read the booklet and hold the CD, but ultimately, I don't think the disc itself is really relevant to me. I got it, I enjoyed it for 10 minutes, I moved on. I am unlikely to ever open or use the disc again. YMMV. ",
