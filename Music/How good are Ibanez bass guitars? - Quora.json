            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve just bought a Ibanez SRM805, after playing all of the 5 string basses at Anderton\u2019s (one of the largest music stores in the UK). Firstly, despite this being made in Indonesia rather than Japan, the fit and finish of this bass is outstanding, and equal to the MIA Fender Elite Jazz, Wawick Thumb and Ernie Ball MusicMan basses I tried. In fact, the spalted poplar top looks better than those, especially as they cost two or three times as much. Actually, even the entry level Ibanez basses are well finished, nicely dressed frets, decent hardware and pickups, so material value for money is a big plus as a brand. This bass has Bartolini pickups, an active 3-band preamp and a rather interesting multiscale fanned fret neck. The neck is slim and fast and the string spacing is quite narrow (16.5mm). The set up was perfect out of the box for me, and I didn\u2019t have to change anything other than a slight intonation tweak. Soundwise, this is a very flexible instrument. with the active eq, midrange switch and pickup blend giving a wide rane of tones. The multiscale concept means that the strings have balanced tension across the pitches - normally a B string on a 34\u2033 scale bass feels loose compared to the G and D and tends to feel a bit floppy. This one sounds pretty consistent from string to string and up and down the neck. The basic tone is bright and bell like - good for both slap and rock-style grind. the low-end is full and there is a bright top end, a bit \u2018hi-fi\u2019 for some tastes, but i really like it. It sounds nothing iike my Sire V7 Jazz style bass, which I still like for it\u2019s traditional single-coil fenderish tones and complements it nicely. I didn\u2019t mean to write a review, but suffice it to say that Ibanez basses are a high-quality instrument that stand comparison with much more expensive pieces. Value for money is excellent, and they play and sound great. If you can forgive them for not being a Fender P or J, Musicman or something else with rock cred. Ibanez offer innovation and quality at affordable prices and I recommend you check them out.    ",

            "answer_text": "This is really an opinion thing, therefore not nearly as easy to answer. A dozen people could say they love them and you might find you hate it. I had 2 Ibanez basses, I can\u2019t honestly tell you I cared where they were made or anything like that\u2026those things aren\u2019t as important to me as taking whatever I\u2019m playing and making the best sound out of them I possibly can. They were both SR series, the exact product code escapes me. My first one was about a 1993 model 6 string, it got the job done, was playable for me but looking back it had a really dull tone. I picked another 6 string one up in about 2005 around the time that they were all natural wood finish, no enamel and had Bartollini pickups. While it played about the same I absolutely hated the sound of that thing. Way too tinny for my preferences. I sold off both of them when I bought a Brawley 6 string bass, that\u2019s the one I was able to finally contour and find my sound with. Since Brawley is no longer a brand I can find I also bought a Ltd B-206SM who\u2019s sound I\u2019ve been toying with. Maybe I could get flamed for buying cheaper instruments by the way. However, I\u2019ve heard high end basses and low and not all high end basses fit the sound I like. To each their own. ",
