            "answer_text": "Well, there's some good news and there's some bad news. The good news is that if there has ever been a time to make money from being a rapper, then this is definitely the time. The bad news is that the odds are still stacked heavily against you if you want to become the next big thing in Hip Hop. If we go back just 15 years, then making a living from being a rapper was a totally different ball game. All your music would be burnt onto CD and you would only make your money from hand-to-hand sales, walking round your local town and selling your CD to people in your neighbourhood. If you wanted to get bigger than that then you would have to post your CD to record labels and hope that an agent somewhere saw potential in your music. You may get some money from a gig here and there if you were lucky and if you wanted promotion then you\u2019d have to get a gig in a big city, maybe at a rap battle event. But keep in mind that Hip Hop had only really gone mainstream in the U.S so if you lived anywhere else in the world, this was even further out of your grasp. But things have changed. Fast forward to 2018, with the internet now becoming the main platform for artists to promote and sell their music, the possibility of making money has dramatically improved. With websites like Spofity and YouTube anyone can upload their music and videos for the entire world to view or listen, with potential to make capital from sales and views. And then with social media like Facebook and Twitter, you can promote your music and create a fanbase much easier as well. Mechandise is now much cheaper and accessible to produce and sell, and getting gigs and applying for positions in rap events is also easier than ever. If you also keep in mind that Hip Hop has now arguably become the most popular genre of music worldwide, this means that making a living from Hip Hop is definitely much more possible than it has been in previous years. But this doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s going to be easy, because having all of these perks comes at a cost: much more competition. It seems that these days, every man and their dog considers themselves a \u2018rapper\u2019, meaning that you really do need to be on top of your game: considering every last detail of how you write, record and promote your music.. and yourself. You need to consider the whole package, rather than just the music. Here are the five main factors that a rapper will need to keep in mind if he wants to make any decent amount of money: Beats - you can\u2019t just get away with using any beat. Ideally you need to have your own beats so that you can\u2019t get done for copyright when you upload them and also when you perform the music, you have high quality WAV beats and not some MP3 ripped off of YouTube. This may require some investement buying beats from producers or time spent learning how to make beats yourself.Social Media - you\u2019re going to probably have to run all of this by yourself, and make sure you\u2019re updating it as often as possible to keep people interested. You\u2019ll also have to be careful about what you say and how you say it, because people are going to be watching your every move, looking for something that they can witch hunt you with if you put a foot out of place.Appearance - because there is more focus on musicians appearance now more than there ever has been, you will need to make sure you \u2018look the part\u2019 or at least that you have some sort of \u2018look\u2019 that people will recognise you for. This shouldn\u2019t really be something for a musician to have to worry about, but unfortunately in this day and age, it is.Visuals - as with appearance, the same applies to your videos. People now expect you to have videos or \u2018bar videos\u2019 which will need to have something about them in order to get shares and likes. Keep in mind this is all going to cost some money, so you\u2019ll be definitely having to invest some of your own cash before you\u2019ve seen any sufficient amount of return for your capital.Material - your material will have to be original. There will have to be something about it. Whether it be the rhymes, the flow, the delivery, the content\u2026 or whatever. One of these things or a combination of these things will need to stand out from the rest. Try to avoid emulating what other people are doing and aim to add something new to the genre.So as you can probably tell from these 5 factors, it\u2019s not only going to involve maybe making some investment at first but it\u2019s also going to involve a lot of hard work if you\u2019re going to be taking it seriously. So yes, making a living from being a rapper is possible and more possible than it\u2019s ever been. But it\u2019s also very likely going to be a full-time job. If you\u2019re already working a job then you\u2019re going to be having a lot of late nights and early mornings with not many days off, and if you\u2019re unemployed then you will need to get working towards your goals asap to start getting some money in. Once you\u2019ve laid down the foundations of your business you can start trying to get some gigs which can bring in some revenue. And once you have a decent sized fan base maybe get some merchandise to see how it sells. You can also apply for rap battles if this is your thing as it is a great platform for promotion, probably the best in the industry. But remember that rap battles can make rappers, but also destroy them. So you\u2019ll have to be careful about what people can find out about you and make sure you're good at battling as its completely different from just rapping. This should be all you need to get started and hopefully you will be able to fulfill your dream of making a living from rap. But if it doesn\u2019t work out, then don\u2019t let that stop you from making music and being a rapper. Rap shouldn\u2019t be about making money, it should be about enjoying making music. Make sure that you\u2019re enjoying what you\u2019re doing, and then if you make some money, well then that\u2019s just an added bonus. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes of course you can make a career out of anything your truely passionate about and that makes you happy and makes you want to push further to motivate yourself to success. One thing that truely breaks my heart and really gets me is why so much in this type of industry specifically the arts in all areas that it\u2019s said to be something you cannot gain money from or get a real job out of in the long run. In my opinion if you have talent and produce that to the world in a way that is truely unique and different of course you can make a respectable career from it who is to say you cannot it\u2019s just less likey to happen straight away so the government wants you to work for them paying for them and even though it should be going into subsidies studies to help struggling artist gain recognition as the Australian hip hop industry is not as big as it is in other countries like America ect. We don\u2019t Have more people or profitable money that could be helping make this possible into a better place to help in the long run gain a better income and do something u enjoy. But by all means I say if you truely want to rap or make music if u find that as a coping mechanism, away to let our emotions out, talk to people reach people send a msg that might change the world keep doing what u love and what your good at it because there are always going to be people who will kick you down in the industry and try and break your hope but don\u2019t ever give up?if you want something in life u have to make and find opportunities open the door. It\u2019s sometimes a shame to think it\u2019s who you know not what ",
