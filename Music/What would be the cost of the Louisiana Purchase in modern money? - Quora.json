            "answer_text": "WOW!!!!!! FRANCE finally selling the Louisiana Territory. Poor Tom Jefferson could of saved us a lot of money if he hadn\u2019t failed in his bid to buy it from Napoleon for $15,000,000, back in 1803, or in today\u2019s dollars about $350 million. The French Ambassador when asked why France is now selling the Louisiana Territory, said, \u201cWe got bills to pay.\u201d Pressed further, one of his aides spoke off the record: \u201cYou Americans have settled our Louisiana territory. You\u2019ve carved states out of it. You assume it as part of your nation. And I must say, so did we French. \u201cHowever, one of our auditors, stumbled across the deed and found that America hadn\u2019t fulfilled all the terms of the agreement. so technically America defaulted.\u201d \u201cTechnically defaulted?\u201d asked a stunned reporter. \u201cOui! Oui! To the sum, how do you American say the next number more than a trillion-\u201d \u201cA zillion dollars?\u201d shrieked the reporter. \u201c3 or 4 of those,\u201d stated the aide. \u201cYou\u2019ll bankrupt us!\u201d cried the reporter. \u201cYes, we know that. That is why we are seeking seven percent of the present evaluation of our territory as a final sales price.\u201d \u201cHow did you arrive at that price?\u201d asked the reporter. \u201cOur auditor calculated that the original sales price was seven cents an acre, and made his calculations from there. After all, you Americans are all squatters, oui, oui?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to come at this a bit differently. The actual purchase price was not in dollars, but in French francs. In 1803, the French franc was worth 290.034mg of gold. The United States paid 68 million francs, for a total of 19,722 kg of gold, or a touch over 634,000 troy ounces of gold. At the present spot price of gold of $1233 per ounce, that\u2019s $781,955,000 or so. Actually, we did not have to deliver that much gold, because a portion of the purchase price involved the U.S just forgiving French debts owed to the U.S. of around 18 million francs. Of course it was quite a steal, since dear old Napoleon was desperate for cash for the wars in Europe. If we were to re-sell it back to France today, I expect we\u2019d charge a bit more. That area probably represents around 20% of U.S. GDP, or around $3.5 trillion or so annually. If you figure that the value is some low multiple of gross product, it would be worth about $10 trillion or so as an ongoing concern. So if we sold it we could pay off around half the national debt.
