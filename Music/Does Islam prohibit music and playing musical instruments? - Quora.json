            "answer_text": "Since the status of music and musical instruments is quite a heavily debated topic in Islam, we need to examine all the evidences and arguments that have been presented over time. But first, we must make a few things clear: Everything in Islam is considered permissible unless you can find something from the Qur\u2019an or a statement from the Prophet \ufdfa saying otherwise. The opposite is simply not true and completely illogical (I have the history of Islamic scholarship to back me up on this one).Using a Hadith with any weakness in it is unacceptable, and we must always have a hadith going back to the Prophet. Otherwise, we have no way of knowing if the person narrating the hadith in question made a mistake or not.We don\u2019t care about personal opinion - just because you think something should or shouldn\u2019t be permissible/forbidden is completely irrelevant.Okay, so now that we got that out of the way, let\u2019s proceed with our analysis (sorry if this is too long): \u201cMusic is clearly forbidden, I mean, it\u2019s in Sahih al-Bukhari !!!\u201d I\u2019d like to address this argument straight off the bat. This may be shocking to a lot of Muslims, but not every hadith in the collection we have from Bukhari is actually authentic. This is because Bukhari\u2019s collection is not a musnad - it\u2019s a musannaf. For those who are new to the study of hadith literature, a musnad is a hadith collection organized according to the narrator of the report. A musannaf, however, is organized according to legal category. This almost always means that the author of a musannaf is organizing his hadith collection in order to make legal arguments, and yes, Bukhari was known for his knowledge of fiqh. We even know that Bukhari would purposely include weak hadiths within the titles of his categorization in his collection, likely in order to present arguments against them. But on top of all that, we know other things as well, like the fact that Bukhari included mu\u2019allaq hadiths in his collection. This occurs when a narrator omits a narrator(s) that would have to be there in order for him or her to have heard this hadith. For example, if I claim to have heard something from a man who died before I was born, it should be obvious that there was a middleman. What is interesting is that all of the hadiths forbidding music in Bukhari\u2019s collection are mu\u2019allaq. For example (a translation): Narrated Abu 'Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari: \u2026that he heard the Prophet (\ufdfa) saying, \"From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments, as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 5590, Book 74, Hadith 16. I don\u2019t know a single muhaddith who has examined the isnad of this hadith (and others like it) and hasn\u2019t concluded that this is a mu\u2019allaq hadith. So the question remains, why would Bukhari include mu\u2019allaq hadiths anyway? The answer is intriguing - it was actually a habit of Bukhari to omit narrators for certain hadiths once he concluded that the isnad for the hadith was weak. This is something few scholars mention, which is why so many people have used these hadiths anyway, thinking that Bukhari viewed them as authentic. But the implications of this fact are actually much bigger. If a person were to find other chains of narration for the same hadith, and matched up the narrators to Bukhari\u2019s narration, then we have a complete chain right? But the problem still remains that Bukhari found the chain itself weak (i.e. one or more narrators were untrustworthy in some way), so we need to make sure to find other chains of narration. Now, there have been scholars who did in fact have other isnads for this hadith, and they, like many, believed these isnads to be authentic (such as Ibn Hajr and an-Nasa\u2019i). However, there is just too much evidence that suggests that even these narrations have weaknesses (there are just too many issues with missing or weak narrators). Every person who has studied hadith literature that I know personally has concluded that there is not a single hadith condemning music that is authentic. If someone reading this answer has found an authenticated chain, please tell me. \u201cMusic is forbidden in the Qur\u2019an\u201d The verse in the Qur\u2019an that has usually been used in arguments condemning music is the following: \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a \u0644\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u062b\u0650 \u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0636\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0633\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0639\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064d \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u062a\u0651\u064e\u062e\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0647\u064f\u0632\u064f\u0648\u064b\u0627 \u06da \u0623\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0626\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c \u0645\u064f\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064c \u201cAnd of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead [others] from the way of Allah without knowledge and who takes it in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment\u201d - The Qur\u2019an [31:6] The big controversy concerns the words \u0644\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u062b\u0650 (lahwa al-hadith) which refers to any speech, words, or stories that are generally perceived as trivial. However, there are two companions of the Prophet \ufdfa whom others claim said that these words refer to music - Ibn Abbas and Ibn Masood. But there are a few problems with this argument: The narration that goes back to Ibn Abbas, the one supposedly claiming that these words refer to music or singing, has weaknesses it, to the extent that some scholars don\u2019t even believe he actually said it. I\u2019m still looking into the case of Ibn Masood, but either way\u2026Even if it was true that both Ibn Abbas and Ibn Masood believed these words referred to music, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that no scholar of the Arabic language has ever made such a claim. There is not a single text or dictionary of the Classical Arabic language that makes this claim either.Both Ibn Abbas and Ibn Masood were human beings who were given a lot of knowledge, but like all human beings, they still made mistakes (Ibn Abbas\u2019 stance on the mut\u2019ah marriage was opposed by literally every other companion). And the fact that the verse in question was revealed early on in Islamic history, yet there is no authentic narration that says that any other companion (namely Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, or \u2018Ali) ever said these words referred to music, suggests that this opinion was quite rare.We should always resort to authentic narrations that go back to the Prophet. A companion saying that something is forbidden isn\u2019t sufficient evidence unless they quote the Prophet.What about the other narrations regarding music? This is just icing on the cake. A lot of people get confused when they read all of the hadiths where the Prophet is clearly fine with people listening to music or singing. But hopefully now it makes sense. I was thinking of listing all of the hadiths that show that the Prophet (and several other companions) were fine with music and singing, but this answer would just get even longer. Since we must assume that something is permissible until we can prove that it is forbidden in Islam, many have argued that, based on what was stated above, we can\u2019t really say that music is forbidden, and I agree with that view. However, if you have evidence to the contrary, please don\u2019t hesitate to comment. ",

            "answer_text": "In The Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful Islamic scholarship, despite popular belief as evidenced by Saad \u2018s answer, is actually divided on this subject (and many others). Islam\u2019s primary source, the Qur\u2019an, never explicitly forbids music. Rather, it was an idea that developed around Hadith, the secondary source for Islamic rulings on religious matters. There are variants to the musical instrument thing. The most conservative view is only voice is allowed, the next is voice and ethnic percussion. The most liberal is that all instruments are allowed, and all music is allowed provided it doesn\u2019t promote disobedience towards Allah or disbelief in Allah. At the moment, there are also issues that a performer can\u2019t necessarily control, for example who listens to his music. Music should not encourage adultary, but if a married couple is listening to a love song that encourages love making (shall we say) there\u2019s nothing at all wrong with that. This is why some newer artists point out that their music is for married couples. Orthodox Islam (e.g. not Wahhabism, Salafism) is not cut and dry on finer points. It\u2019s made to seem that way even by Muslims themselves, but Islamic scholarship is anything but completely united on this matter. What is explicitly written in the Qur\u2019an is easy to abide by and make religious law around (Fiqh law). It\u2019s not so easy when the Qur\u2019an doesn\u2019t say something explicitly about a subject, because then Hadith get involved; and well, some Muslims don\u2019t even agree on what Hadith are authentic or not. There\u2019s only one God. Check. Muhammad (SAW) is a Prophet and messenger of God. Check. You can\u2019t commit suicide. Check. You shouldn\u2019t consume alcohol. Sort of check. What does the Qur\u2019an really say? Some of the Hanafi school (my school) say it\u2019s only alcohol made from grapes and dates that is forbidden to drink, but all agree you shouldn\u2019t get hammered. The finer points are not monolithic.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Yes, according to the majority of Muslims and Muslim scholars throughout the ages, music and most musical instruments are forbidden. Many narrations of the prophet explicitly forbid musical instruments. For example, in a famous narration Abdullah ibn Umar RD narrated that the prophet said that \u201c Indeed, Allah has forbidden alcohol, gambling, drum and guitar \u2026\u201d. Other narrations extend this ban to other instruments as well. Singing without music is not forbidden however (unless the song promotes wrong stuff), and also a specific type of drum called a duff is generally allowed. Some Muslims do claim nowadays that Islam allows music either because of ignorance or because they want a new interpretation of Islam to fit the modern day. The prophet actually predicted that people would start doing that in a famous Hadith found in the most famous and most widely accepted book of narrations: al Bukhari which states that the Prophet SAW said that in the future \u201c there will appear people who will hold adultery, silk (clothes for men),alcohol, and musical instruments to be lawful\u201d This narration goes to show that traditional Islam continues to hold musical instruments as impermissible. As for why Islam forbids music, that is a long discussion that lies outside the scope of this question. ",

Now I vaguely remember a few decades ago an orchestra from Iran came to play in Washington DC.. But that may have been before Jimmy Carter and his disaster with Iran. But I know that an islamic couple that were getting married in the Gaza got murdered by the Hamas at their wedding for playing nonislamic music for the wedding. I think that approach is much more common in islamic countries. For that reason I expect that , just like the wonderful pieces of artwork carved in the mountains of Afghanistan by the buddhists , were destroyed by the Muslims living in Afghanistan now, I expect that by the end of this century all classical music in Europe will have been ruined and destroyed and forbidden. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve gotten lots of their music here in the USA and I hope most of it gets preserved somewhere. But it will almost certainly disappear in Europe, since Europeans are so pro Islam and allowing Islam to take over. ",

The crucial line is in it [music] being commensurate with the gatherings of entertainment and moral depravity. Other types of music such as those that are used in army, the epic music and the music that is used for mourning are allowed. If classical music is included in the first category, then it is prohibited, otherwise it is not, and it is better to exercise precaution in regards to such type of music. It is, therefore, not permissible to use an instrument for haram music, no matter what type of instrument it may be. The jurisprudents do not specify the type of prohibited instruments, nor do they pinpoint the forbidden type of music. You should turn to \u2018urf\u2019 (custom) to ask whether a certain type of music is used for moral depravity or not. If it is used, it is haram. ",

            "answer_text": "Is playing musical instruments haram in Islam? The general consensus is that it\u2019s haram and forbidden. However I found this link below to be rather interesting. Here's What Quran And Hadith Teach Us About Listening To Music! The intriguing point brought over by Manzoor ul Hassan in the article is that \u201cAllah has beautified the Qur\u2019an with rhyme and rhythm, we can conclude that He loves to rhyme and rhythm in words and beauty in their sounds. Music no doubt is a form of this assonance created by a certain order of words and their sounds. For that account, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w) encouraged the believers to recite the Qur\u2019an with a beautiful and pleasing sound.\u201d Isn\u2019t this an oxymoron now? How can music be accepted when using it to recite the Qur\u2019an but be haram otherwise? You can either be one who blindly follows everything or be one who takes his own decisions after doing your research. I recall the gist of this one story which has stuck with me for a long time. It was a lesson in high school. A person comes up to the Prophet Muhammad and asks him, \u2018there are two neighbours I know. One of them is super religious, prays five times a day, keeps all the fasts but is horrible to people. The other one doesn\u2019t pray that often but he is a kind man who helps around\u2019. The Prophet then said, the kind neighbour is the one who will end up in heaven. Thus it doesn\u2019t matter if you believe music is haram or not. Remember this, in the end if you are not a good person at heart, no matter how religiously you pray, fast etc etc\u2026you are going to end up in hell. ",

Also music must not exceed the point were it becomes important than Prayers.. IF its time for your prayer and u have a music cd collection.. The priority must be for prayers..

Bear in mind that prohibition of music is not a fixed ruling, in fact in the history of Islamic Scholarship there are so many different dictums about music. Back to your question, those two major concepts that lead some Islamic Scholars to prohibit music are \u201ccheerfulness\u201d(\u063a\u0646\u0627; ghena)and \u201cjollification\u201d (\u0637\u0631\u0628; \u1d40\u1d46\u1d3f\u1d46\u1d47). Though there is no mention of cheerfulness, jollification and prohibition of music in Quran, those scholars refer to 4 things to bring up the prohibition:(1) the narrative of Imam Bagher and Imam Sadegh (called Hadith), (2) mention of corruption in Quran, (3) mention of falsehood and untruth in Quran and (4)mention of words that mislead humans. What lead to this prohibition, started about the establishment of Islamic Kingdom. Muslims who lived just in Arabic peninsula started campaigning neighbor lands, so their victories lead to forming administrations, and as we know two things were common in ancient administration (as they are now but in different manners), wealth and revelry. Arabs started to learn musical theory form their neighbors and obviously the main use of it was saturnalia of Muslim courts, that caused music to be recognized by some Islamic Scholars one of the corruptions man could commit.

Summarily, the verse in the Quran which says: some men buy idle speech... (check beginning of suratul Luqman)Abdullah bn Mas'ood swore by Allaah that what is intended by Idle speech in the verse is music. The early generations of Muslims didn't know anything question like is music allowed? To them, it was like asking if pork is allowed. But when generations grow and die on a wrong deed, the wrong deed becomes normal and you need to argue at length to refute it. That's the case of music. Allaah knows best. ",

Many hadiths seem to prohibit it, Quran though, not only doesn\u2019t prohibit it, but also gives signs of its stature. Also read scholars who held music permissible in the first and the lastest generations of Islam: Is music a major sin or minor sin in Islam? ",

Most moderate Muslims will take it as an act of entertainment and not be fussed, even enjoy it. The more conservative scholars from the Safali sect practiced and promoted by Saudi Arabia, would consider such entertainment immoral. I guess sounding a horn for the hunt is fine, playing the horn for entertainment and musical enjoyment - in this case time could be better spent. ",
