            "answer_text": "You do realize the events of The Hobbit, took place 80 years before those of Lord of the Rings? Even going by that alone, he couldn't be the same character, since a man would obviously look a lot older even if they were a numenorean. However, Alfrid is not even in the book. Rather, the Master of Laketown was a very dishonest man, and he basically acted the same way as Alfrid in the movie. He didn't expect anything from the dwarves; he just thought they were imposters that were trying to scam the town. But the people were so overjoyed with the return of the Mountain King, right out of Legend, that the Master of Laketown simply gave the dwarves whatever they wanted, and wished them good riddance, figuring that they would just go away. There was no reason to kill him off by making the Dragon fall on him, that was just stupid. As well as poetically unjust, since he didn't kill anybody. He was just greedy and selfish. That's no reason to kill someone off. If anything, the dwarves were to blame, as well as Smaug, for the attack on Laketown. The master was not responsible, even if he was not heroic in defending it. The people made him Master of Laketown because he was an avid business man. It wasn't until the dragon came that they made Bard King, since they realized the need for heroism. ",

            "answer_text": "There's no reason to believe that Peter Jackson, who invented the character of Alfrid Lickspittle for his Hobbit films, intended him to be the same as Gr\u00edma Wormtongue from the Lord of the Rings book and films, similarities in sleaziness aside. However, one reason to believe that they are not intended to be the same character is the age discrepancy.  Alfrid, who is played by actor Ryan Gage, appears to be in his thirties in the Hobbit films.  That would make him around 110 years old during the events of Lord of the Rings.  While little is known about Gr\u00edma Wormtongue (played by Brad Dourif when the actor was about 50 years old) prior to becoming  counsellor of Th\u00e9oden, it is doubtful that a man who was not of N\u00famenorean descent would have lived to such an age.
