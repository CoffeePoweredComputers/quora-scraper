            "answer_text": "Can sound waves amplify each other? The question is somewhat ambiguous, but in general terms, yes. If you sum two sounds together, the positive amplitude of each will contribute to an overall increase in sound level. To put it in the most simple terms, two people clapping are louder than one person clapping. The critical issue is a complex one and has to do with phase - the above statements hold true only if the phase of the waveforms are positive. Two coherent waveforms with one wave reversed 180\u00ba in phase will actually cancel each other out completely. Since all sounds have both positive and negative phase components, when you combine sounds you get a mixture of reinforcement and cancellation. But since complete coherence is hardly ever encountered in the real world, you can generally assume that the more waveforms you combine, the louder your resulting sound will be. ",
