Then Ms. Jisoo Turtle Rabbit Kim turned into a hybrid of a turtle and a rabbit and transported to Antarctica and called her penguin friends to help save Jennie and Lisa. After that - they all went to Queen YG and asked her for a spell but she didn\u2019t have one, so Jisoo ate her and burped out the potion and gave it to Jennie and Lisa and they started dating! :)) ",
