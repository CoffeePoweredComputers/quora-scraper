            "answer_text": "Having served in Peace Corps in Kazakhstan with friends who served in the area between the Black Sea and the Aral Sea, I can offer at least one theory. This theory is based a lot on the fact that Sacha Baron Cohen is well educated and didn't just make some random choice. I think he wanted intentional ambiguity by using the country of Kazakhstan in name but almost every location and character he showed was clearly from an an area west of Kazakhstan. If you know that part of the world no one shown in that movie looks like people from Kazakhstan nor does most of the landscape look like the area he filmed. I think the intention was actually to reduce the offensiveness to the people of those areas by being clear to anyone well familiar with the region that this clearly wasn't Kazakhstan. Use the name Kazakhstan and then show and act like a different part of that area of the world. So imagine creating an offensive American character and labeling him Cajon but showing him at home in a cold coastal climate and giving him a Minnesota accent. It wouldn't be clear who he is really mocking specifically. ",

The jokes are not intended to represent the reality of Kazakhstan, and are just a vehicle for the humour. Jokes that are Kazakh-specific, I cannot recall any, for the jokes to work, they would need to apply to all former soviet \u2018Stans.Sasha Baron Cohen was a man I used to really admire, but having recently watched *The Dictator* I have lost a great deal of my former respect for him, and found it a shockingly offensive piece of anti-Islamic shi\u2019ite",
