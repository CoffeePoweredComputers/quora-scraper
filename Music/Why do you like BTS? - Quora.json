But I first wanna say that most people think we love BTS because of their visuals\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s not wrong\u2026 They\u2019re handsome and cute, but most of the time that\u2019s not the reason, and if you\u2019re an \u201cARMY\u201d just because of their visuals, please leave. That\u2019s not a valid reason to love them. That\u2019s super diva. I\u2019m actually not really a K-pop stan. Sure, I sometime listen to other bands other than BTS, like \u2018LOVE SCENARIO\u2019 by iKon or \u2018WHISTLE\u2019 by BLACKPINK, but I\u2019m not really a fan of those groups, I\u2019m only an ARMY so I will gladly tell you why I am an ARMY. In the beginning I didn\u2019t even know that such a thing called \u2018K-pop\u2019 existed. Of course, I knew that other countries had music too, but I just never realized it. I was really a big fan of Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez and Billie Eilish, and I still like them but I haven\u2019t heard American pop in five months \ud83d\ude02 1. Dancing K-pop artists dance WAY more. When it\u2019s a male American artists, they mostly just sit on a couch or a bed and they just look in the camera. BTS on the other hand (and other K-pop groups, of course) dance instead of just boringly sitting on a couch. One negative thing is that they have to lip sync pretty much, since the choreography is hard and exhausting, but they CAN sing beautiful even without autotune and sometimes they don\u2019t lip sync.  Now haters be thinking: \u201cSo What\u201d? (lame joke lol) \u201cThey still can\u2019t sing especially Jin.\u201d \u2026  And Seok-jin CAN sing alright. Who cares if he\u2019s the weakest vocalist of The Vocal Line, HIS VOICE IS STILL AN ANGEL\u2019S. And have you seen the DNA-dance? THEN you\u2019ll understand why they lip sync, you\u2019ll literally die from exhaustion because it\u2019s just too exhausting and frustration because you cannot perfect the dance.  2. Songs I like the fact that it\u2019s a mixture between Korean and English, not always the same language. Of course I don\u2019t understand everything since I don\u2019t speak Korean and when they\u2019re speaking English their pronunciation ain\u2019t that good. And then, the famous words of non k-pop friends/parents: \u201cWhy do you listen to them when you don\u2019t even understand them?\u201d  Never heard of lyric videos, lyric translation, subtitles and other shit? And when you finally understand what they\u2019re singing, you cry because the lyric is so beautiful (they make their music/lyrics themselves most of the time). \u201cWe were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries,Seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards.Let\u2019s not forget those things, but put them away.\u201d \u2014 \u201cMoving On\u201d \u201cI believe in myself;My back hurts in order to let my wings sprout.\u201d \u2014 \u201cWings\u201d \u201cWho says a dream must be something grand?Just become anybodyWe deserve a lifeWhatever, big or small, you are you after all.\u201d \u2014 \u201cParadise\u201d \u201cFollow your dream like breaker.Even if it breaks down,Don\u2019t ever run backwards, never.Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest.\u201d \u2014 \u201cTomorrow\u201d I also like that there\u2019s always a rap verse in the songs, and those lyrics are not about drugs or sex, but also about beautiful things. It\u2019s also always another voice and not always the same person. Though I would want Jin to sing more, my favorite solo\u2019s from BTS are from Jin (\u2018Epiphany\u2019 and \u2018Awake\u2019) Jungkook is the lead vocalist and his voice is beautiful, so is Jimin\u2019s and Tae\u2019s, but Jin\u2019s is too. I know he\u2019s a supporter, but he also has a beautiful voice and sometimes he has to BEG for more lines.  Love Yourself: Her Love Yourself: Tear Love Yourself: Answer (my favorite)So one of the main reasons is because the message they give is unlike other artists. Other artists mostly talk about break-ups and love, but BTS mostly sings about self love. They think that real love begins with self love and that is true, I really appreciate the beautiful message they\u2019re giving. They did the project \u2018Love Yourself\u2019 (Love Yourself: Her \u2014 Love Yourself: Tear \u2014 Love Yourself: Answer) and thanks to them, some ARMY\u2019s were finally able to love themselves. 3. Personality Male American artists are mostly fuckboys/players or just really selfish. There are very few male American artists I think are kind. Right now I can only think of Shawn Mendes. But all the BTS members are really kind. They aren\u2019t players and if you\u2019re thinking \u2018Yes, but that\u2019s probably because Big Hit Entertainment bans them from doing that since they\u2019ll ruin their reputation by that\u2019, you\u2019re right. Big Hit Entertainment wouldn\u2019t allow that because their reputation would be ruined. And it\u2019s not like I know them personally, I\u2019ve only seen them on Vlives, Run BTS!, Eat Jin, BTS Bon Voyage, Bangtang Bomb, interviews and etc. But they really seem like kind boys and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re acting (I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve seen them acting and even though Jungkook is the Golden Maknae who\u2019s good at everything, his acting isn\u2019t that good). They also get along well with each other. For example: I don\u2019t really think BLACKPINK can get along that well with each other (sorry if I\u2019m wrong, it\u2019s just my opinion). When Lisa and Jisoo are being their normal crackheads, Jennie and Ros\u00e9 just stare at them like wtf and sometimes you can the the atmosphere is pretty awkward and they don\u2019t even talk to each other. But BTS, oh man, put two members with each other doesn\u2019t matter who and they\u2019re SO caring and funny. And because of their love for each other the ARMY\u2019s have created ships. My favorite is Jinkook, Taekook and Namjin. But of course my FAVORITE FAVORITE FAVORITE ship is OT7.  I also wanted to mention the parents of BTS, Jin and Namjoon. Jin is the eldest member of BTS and Namjoon is the leader, so of course that makes them a good parenting duo, so I really like the \u2018Namjin\u2019 ship. The other members even said that Jin and Namjoon are the ones holding BTS together.   This is the main reason why I like them: they\u2019re funny crackheads who never fail to make me laugh, they just put the biggest smile on your face. I\u2019m only a few seconds into a \u2018Try Not To Laugh W/ BTS\u2019 and I already fail, they\u2019re just too funny. Individually they\u2019re already hopeless crackheads but when you PUT THEM TOGETHER\u2026 it\u2019s a total chaos. BTS aren\u2019t clowns, they\u2019re the whole circus. TXT: \u2018We want to be like our seniors, BTS\u2019. This family is going to be funny but way too unstable \ud83d\ude02 And you would think they only act like this in private or on Run BTS! or whatever ones of their shows, but YOU\u2019RE WRONG. They also act like crackheads in PUBLIC and on AWARD SHOWS.  When they won a prize for their song \u2018I Need U\u2019 they put lipstick on each other\u2019s faces bwahahha I can\u2019t with these guys  When all the idols showed up on the award show in fancy, expensive black suits and the girls in expensive black dresses but BTS showed up in Pok\u00e9mon outfits \ud83d\ude02 Not only that, BTS is basically a whole meme.      Sailor Moon? More like Sailor JOON HAHHAHA (so lame I know \ud83d\ude02)  This photo of Namjoon is too hilarious I can\u2019t\u2014  Lol, get it? BLACKPINK \ud83d\ude02    I love it when Jin screams ;-; \ud83d\ude02       How ARMY\u2019s fight   Yes these two are the same persons \u261d\ud83d\udc47   A short compilation of Jungkook being Jungshook  One thing I also really like is that they\u2019re not show offs/diva\u2019s. I mean, they\u2019re the most famous and successful boyband in the world, yet they\u2019re still kind, don\u2019t spend their money on idiot things like the Kardashians and don\u2019t act all stuck-up and arrogant. 4. Content It ain\u2019t normal how many content these guys have. They always post so that they can interact better with ARMY and their content is really entertaining and funny. They never fail to entertain us and they don\u2019t keep us waiting. Because of their content we also know more of them than we know American artists.  Run BTS!  V Lives (I know Run BTS! and their other shows are published on V Live but I mean their livestreams)  BTS Bon Voyage  BANGTANTV/BTS BOMB, they already have over 31 million subscribers (lol omfg last time I checked it was 21 million subs and within a week or two weeks they already got 10+ million subs jeez bitches slow down \ud83d\ude02)  Twitter (you CANNOT scroll more than five minutes on Twitter without seeing BTS)  Eat Jin (V Lives where Jin eats) And they also have an Instagram account and TikTok and maybe more but it\u2019s too much that I don\u2019t know all of \u2019em (yes, that means FOLLOW THEM ON TIKTOK AND INSTAGRAM). 5. Music Videos Their music videos are so good. Sometimes they\u2019re quite colorful (like Boy with Luv or DNA) or sometimes they\u2019re a little darker (like Fake Love or Blood Sweat & Tears) K-pop videos are famous for their visuals, effects and other stuff. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t see the stuff that appeared in Blood Sweat & Tears in an American music video, would you? American music videos by male artists are mostly strippers selling off their body and being touchy with the artist. No thank you, I prefer BTS\u2019s music videos. Big Hit is also famous for their concepts and theories in their MV\u2019s. Lol I use my brain more for BTS theories than school.   6. They\u2019re an inspiration Come on, EVERYONE has heard about BTS, if it\u2019s about their looks, music or rise in popularity. If not, you lived under a rock (like me, I didn\u2019t knew BTS existed until a few years ago). But they weren\u2019t always this popular. BTS debuted back in 2013, seven years ago, under a company called Big Hit Entertainment. At that time Big Hit was a VERY small company (now Big Hit Entertainment is one of the Big 3 Best K-pop Companies, putting JYP Entertainment on Number 4 UwU) almost nobody heard from them, so it\u2019s normal that people thought BTS wouldn\u2019t be a big group. In the beginning they were already happy with 300 views, 300 attendants to their concerts and fansigns and etc. They all had to sleep together in one apartment and couldn\u2019t even have a company dinner because Big Hit didn\u2019t had the money for it. During the N.O.-era they almost disbanded because they were too low on budget. They debuted with their song \u2018No More Dream\u2019 on June 13, 2013, and I gotta say, it\u2019s not the best song. But in the beginning they were a group who was focused on hip hop and I just don\u2019t like hip hop in general. By the way, with \u201cit\u2019s not the best song\u201d I mean it\u2019s not that good because it\u2019s sang in a wrong way. BTS sang it again in 2019 or so and it. Was. BEAUTIFUL. This just proves all songs are good but you gotta sing it in a good way.  They also got mocked a lot in the beginning and had A LOT of haters, and many people said they couldn\u2019t make it. Their songs either fell of the charts pretty fast or didn\u2019t even chart at all. Even though people still told them they couldn\u2019t make it, they didn\u2019t give up and still wanted to pursue their dream of becoming a successful artist. In 2014 they won a real award for \u2018I NEED U\u2019 (and they put lipstick on each other\u2019s faces lol) but they still weren\u2019t that popular. But once again, they didn\u2019t stop. They still wanted to pursue their dream and got support from the few ARMY they had that time. After \u201cI NEED U\u201d, \u201cRUN\u201d they became more popular, and when \u201cFIRE\u201d came out they were one of the best idols in South-Korea. However, everything changed during the \u201cBlood, Sweat & Tears\u201d-era and they became internationally famous. After that they broke record after record. \u201cBTS is the first boyband in Korean history to win over FORTY Daesangs\u201d \u201cBTS is the first K-pop band to perform at the AMA\u2019s\u201d \u201cBTS is the first K-pop band to perform at the BBMA\u2019s\u201d \u201cBTS is the first K-pop band to win FOUR BBMA-awards\u201d \u201cBTS is the first K-pop band to have won a BBMA\u2019s \u2018Top Social Artist\u2019 award three years in a row with over 280 MILLION votes\u201d \u201cBTS is the first K-pop band to win a BBMA\u2019s \u2018Top Duo/Group\u2019 award\u201d \u201cBTS is the first K-pop band to perform at the Grammy\u2019s\u201d \u201cBTS\u2019s \u2018Map of the Soul Persona\u2019 is the most sold album of 2019 over the world\u201d \u201cBTS has set a record of getting more than 74 million views in 24 hours\u201d \u201cBTS\u2019s \u201cDNA\u201d has reached over 1 BILLION views on YouTube\u201d \u201cThe President of South Korea signed BTS\u2019s watches and admitted they\u2019re one of the Elite 4 of South Korea\u201d  BTS performing Fake Love at the BBMA\u2019s and Jungkook showing off his abs \ud83d\ude0c And MANY other prizes, it\u2019d take me four hours or something to put every prize they won here. Basically what I want to say is that even though BTS had a SUPER low chance of being a successful artist, they did not give up. Even though people mocked them and every year they saw their seniors winning prizes and they did not, they did not give up. Even though they felt hopeless and petite compared to the other groups, they did not give up. Even though some of the members own parents didn\u2019t support them, they did not give up. BTS was a small rookie group coming from a small company and had the lowest chance of survival, but now they\u2019re the biggest boyband in Korean history and on the world, maybe even bigger than the Backstreet Boys or One Direction (no, I\u2019d say BTS is more successful because they won WAY more prizes than the Backstreet Boys and One Direction and have WAY more fans, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re bigger than The Beatles). Now they always sell out all their concerts and stadiums, they have billions of fans, have millions of views, own their own luxury and expensive apartments and can dine at the most expensive restaurants. This is why they\u2019re an inspiration, you can never know what will happen in the future. They had a big chance of failure and they could\u2019ve lost everything, but they still didn\u2019t want to give up their dream. I really respect and appreciate them for that.  I\u2019m sorry but wtf are those glasses on Joon\u2019s face \ud83d\ude02 7. They\u2019re adorable So when I was talking about the FACT that they\u2019re an inspiration, I kinda sounded like some news reporter, that\u2019s why I\u2019m putting this weird reason to sound more like my usual loving-memes-fangirl-self. No, even though they\u2019re older then me I do not view them as men. I know they\u2019re men, but I\u2019ve seen them acting cute and adorable too many times that I cannot view them as real men, but as adorable, little puppies. Jungkookie my bias \ud83d\udc9c         Worldwide Adorable yes      sdfqsdjfqkd Hobi\u2019s too funny stop making my stomach hurt by laughing   Well, that were all the reasons why I like BTS! I hope you found it interesting/enjoyed it!  There are probably more reasons but I\u2019ve been working on this for TWO HOURS so I need a break. Or were it three hours\u2026?  Lol I don\u2019t know anymore I\u2019ve skipped my quarantine homework for three days straight already and I have to go to school six days before summer break so I gotta make it fast or I\u2019ll get scolded at school.  Anyway I hope you enjoyed it and made you laugh a bit with the BTS meme faces. If not, here are some memes to make you laugh.      I cannot be the only one who loves Jins dad jokes    ",
