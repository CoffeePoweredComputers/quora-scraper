            "answer_text": "If Rap Takes No Talent to Do, Why Can\u2019t Everyone be a Famous Rapper? Because whoever said that rapping takes no talent to do doesn't know anything about rapping. I mean, that may be the case now, but it used to take great skill to be a rapper. Rappers used to battle for supremacy back in the day, so you had to have some darts up your sleeve. Rappers used to read dictionaries and encyclopedias just to have more ammo to use against each other (Wu-Tang and Eminem are some of the wordiest and most esoteric rappers ever); it also sharpened one's knowledge. It wasn't enough to just be from the streets to be an emcee; you had to be a wordsmith, aware of your competitor's strengths/weaknesses and be keen to what's going on in the rest of the world besides your own little bubble. In other words, you had to not only be street savvy but also street smart.  To this day, rappers from the golden age are some of the most intelligent and cultured people around. Take Jay-Z, for instance. If you listen to one of his Hot 97 freestyles, you can see how clever the guy is, but that's not where it ends. I once was reading comments online about his evolution as an artist recently. One person pointed out that he started out corny when he was running with Jaz-O; another stated that it was only because \u201cJay knew how to move in a room full of vultures.\u201d I thought that was phrase was clever because Jay used both this ability and his superlative rapping talent to not only elevate himself as one of the greatest rappers to ever pick up a microphone, but he then used rap as a stepping stone to become a big shot executive at Def Jam. That takes not only rapping talent but talent in how one makes moves.  These days, all one has to do make moves is be 25, have face tattoos and a SoundCloud. I won't knock today's rappers because I actually like some of them (e.g. Migos, Travis Scott and Post Malone; that's it), but there's nothing very challenging in what they do, although they're very good at what they do. One can't help but see how rap has evolved (or devolved) over the years and not pull a \u201cback in my day\u201d every now and then. The shit part of the whole \u201cback in my day\u201d schpiel is that the late 80s and 90s actually were when rap was at its most creative, so those of us who grew up in the era have every right to complain about how far we've gotten away from that. We're not just complaining because of a generation gap and not being able to enjoy new music because of that; we're just fed up with the complacency. Even while Bone Thugs were embroiled in a beef with Migos, they made it clear that they had no problem with Migos themselves; just that they're watering down rap and not paying homage/giving credit to a group that helped establish their sound (Bone Thugs).  It's funny to think that guys like Method Man or Ghostface Killah can be deemed \u201cold heads\u201d (especially if they complain about today's music) when they're some of the most rugged and raw rappers ever. It's just amusing to me that we live in an age where today's rappers don't even pay homage to the ones that paved the way for them. It's mostly all about money and fame now. It's pathetic. ",
