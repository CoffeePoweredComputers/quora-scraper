Even the People that tell their friends that your ad was annoying, will help you grow in some form, remember, all pr is great pr. Spotify ads have helped artist become major artists With millions of followers, millions of plays, they then get monthly streams by all these New fans, earning more then what the payed for their ads. It\u2019s funny how People, Companies, famous artists talk about how small the spotify payouts are, but in fact they are high, they are fair and the payouts make it possible for small artists to quit their regular job. But you have to advertise With the giants to make it big or else you need to get signed and get a major label to advertise on spotify, let them take 64% - 90% of your Money. I don\u2019t understand why People think it is expensive to invest in themselves and that most People think advertising is something unimportant, while it really is the oposite. I am an agent, I help artists With distribution, artists that use a label that takes 0% of your Money, will send you cashouts that show that spotify is paying enough per play. Somethimes you will get relly high payouts for small ammounts of plays. One artist was payed $101.63 for ONLY 9917 music streams and another artist was payed $594.22 for 46208 plays and that\u2019s why no one should listen to rumors, they are most of the time, ONLY rumors.
