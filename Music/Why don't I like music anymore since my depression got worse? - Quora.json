I just seem too \u201cscattered\u201d to sit down in front of my sound system and devote the listening time needed to get back into the \u201cswing of things\u201d, Glenn Miller, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Harry James, \u201cSatchmo\u201d Armstrong, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, Ted Nugent, Robin Trower, The Who, Led Zepplen, Elvis Presely, Paralement, Bob James, Earl Klugh, Rolling Stones, Sly and the Family Stone, Aphrodotie\u2019s Child, The Carpenters, GinoVanelli, Simon and Garfunkle, songs of the 40\u2019s 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s 80\u2019s it\u2019 all sitting on a shelf collecting dust. It\u2019s the same thing with my two motorcycles, a 1973 Yamaha RD-350 two stroke twin and my 1985 Yamaha FJ1100 crotch rocket, and my three sail-boards all untouched in probably 8 years plus now. Nothing seems to be the same as it once was. I cannot even remember what \u201conce was\u201d feels like anymore. Let me know if you find out how to shake this feeling will you please? Therapy isn\u2019t helping. Drugs aren\u2019t helping. Maybe some sex might help, but I am striking out left and right trying to get any help in this department. I asked my ex wife if we could become \u201clovers\u201d but she said \u201cnothing doing\u201d. Harumph! mrc109 ",

            "answer_text": "The technical term is anhedonia\u2014the inability to feel pleasure. You do not take pleasure in something you once enjoyed because your condition is deteriorating. Take action now. Get to your therapist and see a doctor right away. My spouse began to suffer anhedonia last year during a severe return of depression. It was bad. He became someone I no longer recognized. The year was extremely rough. But we saw a psychiatrist in September who did a medication switch and it worked. In three months, I got my spouse back. He is currently enjoying a few rounds of Overwatch and last year, he couldn\u2019t even look at the game or play it for long. Sometimes all it takes is the right adjustment to medicine. ",
