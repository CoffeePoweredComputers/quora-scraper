            "answer_text": "I would actually say that percussion could be considered one of the hardest instruments in band, mainly because of the numerous instruments you have to work with. I say numerous because, in most ensembles (elementary to college/professional-level), you will be asked to play a bit of everything. This includes drums like snare drum, bass drum, and timpani, melodic/mallet instruments like vibraphone, marimba, and xylophone, and auxiliary instruments/accessories like tambourine, suspended cymbal, and triangle, to name only a few. When I officially decided to study percussion during my sophomore year of high school, my pre-conceived notion was that I could just play the bells and be done. I quickly learned that that could not have been further from the case. I started lessons on the snare drum and bells/marimba. As indicated in my previous paragraph, though, there is a whole \u2018world\u2019 of instruments to explore. In my case, and as would be the case in my college ensemble, I played a different instrument in every piece. Only when I got lucky would I play the same instrument (e.g. tambourine) in two pieces. Sometimes, being a percussionist even means having to switch between three or four different instruments in one piece (which can make for a challenging setup)! So, it really takes a lot on the percussionist\u2019s part to have (at least) basic knowledge of how to play all of the instruments he/she is supposed to play. This is a type of skill that is not generally required of anyone else in the band (the only exception I could think of would be a flute player who doubles on piccolo \u2014 and that is usually only the principal chair/maybe second chair of the ensemble, far from everyone in the section). TL;DR no, playing percussion in band is not \u201ceasy\u201d; it requires a distinct skill that other members of the ensemble do not normally have to have (knowledge of playing several/many various instruments of different \u2018categories\u2019).

            "answer_text": "No, but the rewards can be awesome. It takes years of repetative practice. The reward is increasing levels of complexity in rhythm and sheet music become easier to read over time. Eventually, one\u2019s effort will draw attention and songs which seemed impossible at some point suddenly are tamed right under one's grasp \u2014and in those moments it feels as if one isn't playing at all, just riding a soundwave or watching memories sidestreaming in space\u2026 Like bliss it's fun when it gets to the point one can truly listen to themselves and enjoy falling into the rhythm. It's always easy to jam, but it isn't easy being in a band if you are really trying it becomes a labor of love and hard work. And songs do become easy to play in Marching and Concert Band, Jazz or other ensembles, much easier to play with practice. Serious percussion however does take the most of one's aerobic endurance. It is as difficult to the point that people push themselves. Certainly, I drummed many times past the point of my own frustration. I pushed my boundaries and gave it my all, playing everything from timpanies to triangles. When I started, I could not play \u201cWe will rock you.\u201d It took me six months to play a rough version of \u201cMy Sharona\" but I kept going. I put holes in my music book pages in frustration and broke sticks across my legs but I kept going, no matter how difficult. I moved from rock music learning how to play a 3 piece set, to 4 piece set, 5 piece, then studied Jazz Music for 3 years. At one point (and surely if given ample practice) I could read music that involved 4 changing rhythms on four seperate limbs. I remember one small \u201cjazz solo\u201d or breakdown in full to this day. I began playing live rock and roll or punk rock shows at age 15 in 1998 and the stretch lasted through 2012 but enjoyed drumming along to plenty of original songs, creating 3 full length albums, one split, multiple 5-8 song EP's, CD\u2019s, tape, vinyl records, appeared in other people\u2019s compilations, and even had a couple small articles in the newspaper. I still do tap around on the side though currently not in a band. :) Anyways the point is: If you love to drum than you love it, inside and outside of any room and any school. My percussion never stopped with Band class and that's what made me supercede most around me, at least in the top 4 or 5 of class basically all the time. It was obsession, but a good obsession. One to work out my nerves, a hobby. Here's one from the band in 2010. The Cause \u2014 Moderate Rock  To give you an idea of physical limits, below is my band covering NOFX's \u201cThe Decline\u201d, myself again on the drums\u2026 Having practiced and listened repeatedly for months, I mimicked this 18 minute 21 second long song on my drumset. I'd say it resembled about 90% the original sticking, but the tempo. I finished this in 18:13. The importance of the drums is in the rhythm\u2026 8 seconds difference means greater than 99% consistent on the tempo (despite the 1 or 2 odd fluctuations) with no metronome. Ferndale Michigan, Post Bar, 2011. The Cause covers NOFX's The Decline: Part 1/2  Part 2/2 Cover   The original  It was a few years ago now, almost 8\u2026 My drumming developed slightly even beyond this in ways, but this was really my limit with endurances given less than a 60 second break. Most people are literally not able to breathe through playing this long. It\u2019s a measure of endurance in many ways, and each has their limits. I like bow to all drummers better than me and I'm the first to admit. This is just a show of part of any of the hard work it can take. No one's necessarily going to pat you on the back though, you gotta be your own advocate. Look in the mirror and say \u201cI fuckin kick ass, and then get out there and fuckin\u2019 do it!\u201d If you're good enough, people will shout and they'll hug you, even if you're sweaty! And if you suck, they\u2019ll give you hugs too, lol :) Only we know whether we put our all into something. It all came from our hearts but man we used to tear down some shows! To struggle was easy! It's all a part! ",
