            "answer_text": "When measuring the pros and cons of using a Mac environment versus a PC environment, there are lots of advantages and disadvantages to both. Macs are generally more stable, out of the box they are solid machines that most people can use without issues, and are easier to maintain. They do hold the resale value longer and I find I retire pc hardware a year or 2 sooner then the Mac equivalent. I get about 3 years out of a solid pc before I retire the box, and about 4\u20135 with a similar Mac for various reasons. But that is a wash because Macs are, at least, 40 percent more expensive. You could argue that these savings would allow you to upgrade to a faster pc more regularly then the Mac for the same price. So a 3 year cycle can be seen as benificial since you are able to take advantage of the latest hardware more often on the pc side for the same allotted budget. You can build/buy PCs that are far more powerful then anything Apple offers. Macs max our at 128 gigs of ram, I\u2019ve seen PCs go as high as 2 terabytes of ram. Macs max at at 24 Xeon cores, I\u2019ve seen PCs with double that. With i7 machines, you have more options on the pc side and the ability to over clock. You also have amd cpu options on PC that are not available on Mac. Macs only use a limited number of AMD gpus that aren\u2019t nearly as powerful as 2 (or more) high end nvidia cards that a pc can house. Macs are not as expandable as they use to be, adding high end network cards that use 10g or fibre isn\u2019t as straight forward on a Mac, you typically have to use a external thunderbolt box to achieve this versus the pci e slots on most PCs. PCs have more expandabilty for internal storage too, you can put several hard drives or ssds inside a pc. The last Mac to support pci e or more then one internal drive is the original intel Mac Pro that is pretty much a dinasour (last update was 2012) though it is still utilized by lots of post houses. So Macs are more expensive, potentially less powerful, less expandable, but PCs might require more support though they are cheaper and/or more powerful dollar for dollar. And the Adobe suite, 3D software like Maya and C4D and color correction software like Da Vinci Resolve are all equally solid on both operating systems. Once I\u2019m in the software, aside from slightly different modifier keys (control versus command) the experience feels the same. Apple has Final cut x which some editors swear by but other then that I can\u2019t think of any apps I would miss if I was on Windows. I currently use both, Macs for artists but a pc render farm for After Effects and Cinema 4D, for the reasons I stated above. Macs equal happier artists, PCs equal faster and cheaper render nodes. I guess if money were no object I would stay on the Mac side exclusively, but I enjoy the challenge of supporting a mixed environment and seeing my dollar go farther by doing so, even though a mixed environent can also be the worse of both worlds from a support stand point. I don\u2019t think Macs have the same hold on the industry that they had 10 years ago. I see lots of tutorials for After Effects and C4D on youtube that are on Windows boxes, more then ever these, hi-end artists are doing their demos on a suped up pc. It\u2019s hard to justify dropping 5\u201315k on an suped up iMac pro knowing you could build a more powerful pc for a fraction of that price. We are all hoping Apple will remedy this in the near future with a 2019 Mac Pro that is expandable and as powerful as what PCs currently have to offer. So it\u2019s not so cut and dry, The Apple tax you pay for their hardware versus what can get on the pc side kind of makes it a wash. Time is money, you can gain time by being able to render faster or have more machines, cpus, and gpus crunching pixels, but you can also lose that time dealing with more bugs (slightly) and maintence of machines on the pc side.

            "answer_text": "Something many people don't know is that a huge amount of work in the movie/film/documentary industry actually happens in Silicon Valley, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that we create a lot of the technology that enables these products to be made. It also means that its not unusual fo those of us un the area to get puled into some video editing projects even though it is not our primary line of business. Whenever I get pulled in (it has happened a lot) I notice that 99% of the editors are editing the footage on any variety of Mac platforms. Some times it is Mac Pros, often it is Mac Book Pro (seriously they ready do edit on MacBook Pros) and most often its is on iMacs (they hit the sweet spot). They all use Final Cut Pro and all of them have experience with Windows and Adobe Premiere, when I ask them why they use Macs the answers is invariably the same, the Macs are significantly more reliable, they need next to no maintenance, they last longer, they are much easier to use and Final Cut Pro (which is not and never will be available for Windows) on the Mac is faster and more effective than anything on Windows. The bottom line is that, after years of use, they all found that they can edit more footage, that looks better, in less time at lower cost on the Mac platform. ",

Macs do have software that is very optimised to run on Macs and have for years. My dad for instance did all his photo work for his side business on Macs since the 90s. How Macs render their graphics is not the same way as same a gaming windows pc would, kind of like the difference between a Mustang GT and a Porsche 911. Both do different things differently and both have significant strong points. Where Macs strong points are is this particular field, photo and video production and efficiency. Is it \u201ctruly the best for video editing\u201d well that might be in someones opinion as I know of some specific Windows PCs ( few but also VERY costly) that will blow the doors off a Mac Pro but then we are talking about specific built again very expensive Windows PCs. For the mass consumer/amateur/professional looking for a good quality built computer it is the best, and a record to prove to. ",

            "answer_text": "While all prior answers are technically correct, they don\u2019t quite explain the reason for such disproportionate popularity of Macintosh computers among video (and photo) editors and producers. While Mac\u2019s global market share is mostly in single digits (with some regional gyrations, such as almost 30% in Switzerland), its market share among creative professionals (video editors, photo editors, designers, screenwriters and writers in general, etc) is disproportionately high in all those markets, and particularly in the developed world, where in many regions it far exceeds 50%. There are several reasons why creative professionals, and especially visual artists (filmmakers, designers, photographers) overwhelmingly prefer Macs. Apple has had a decades-long head start in colour syncing technology. From the early 90s, the ability to represent true colours and keep them consistent across output devices (printers, displays) was a part of the Mac System (now called the \u201cClassic Mac OS\u201d). While Windows has since addressed this issue, there are still very many vestiges of the old Windows and it still doesn\u2019t always quite function as expected. The most common reason for using Macs (in addition to the colour syncing support) is its consistent reliability. Because one company (Apple) builds the OS and the hardware it runs on, the system software is perfectly optimised for that particular piece of hardware and doesn\u2019t need to waste any overhead in order to account for millions of various obscure hardware combinations. While no computer platform is perfectly trouble-free, decades of experience shows that the platform requires much less system support than Windows. Add to that the realistic situation that there is practically negligible amount of malware in the wild for Mac, compared to millions of variants for Windows, necessitating fortified protection for Windows, vs. nothing (other than common sense) for Mac, and it is difficult to argue against the platform (when there aren\u2019t significant financial constraints). Simple answer: Yes, Macs really are better for video editing than Windows. They are more reliable, perform better, require much less maintenance, and hold their value longer. ",

            "answer_text": "Two years ago, I probably would have said yes, because the hardware is generally more robust and the OS is more stable. However, with Apple\u2019s increasing deaf attitude towards creators and what they need, I would say that Apple is no longer the preferred platform. Every filmmaker I know (not YouTubers, but real pros) is switching to Windows. They all have their own reasons. For some, it\u2019s that Apple hasn\u2019t updated the MacPro for so long. For others, it\u2019s the lack up the ability to upgrade. Then there\u2019s the Apple tax that used to be a bit more reasonable, but has lately just seemed greedy. My own reasons are fairly simple. The latest Macbook Pro doesn\u2019t have the design edge of previous Apple laptops. The lack of ports makes it hard to connect everything I need to the laptop. The USB-c ports that it does offer are super flimsy and disconnect if a butterfly breathes on them. The keyboard is awful and has known quality control issues. The trackpad is so big that is interrupts typing continually. It\u2019s the worst laptop I\u2019ve owned since the Toshiba Satelite back in 2001. If Apple would listen to creators and return to their design values, I might consider switching back, but as it stands, I won\u2019t buy another Apple computer. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tough question because the answer really depends upon the mix of hardware and software. If you are editing standard definition video, any modern platform should work. The simple applications shipped on the mac are useful for the amateur and make the construction of a movie rather easy. As mentioned by others, the use of the GPU often found in the video pipeline can vastly improve performance. The question is: does the editing software support GPU operations. Many modern, HIGH END, laptops offer a video pipeline that includes an Intel Graphics processor coupled with a high end NVidia processor. These machines excel in gaming applications where rendering is important. Operations that involve re-encoding from one standard to another can take a surprising amount of time to convert between formats, so make sure that you start off in the format you wish to end in. If someone was to ask me my opinion in this area, I would select a desktop machine with a super graphics card, lots of memory, and a solid state drive for scratch operations, 512mb minimum. I have both Mac and Windows machines. I have an Adobe Creative Cloud account that lets me use both machines. I really dislike Windows 10, but my MacBook is a 2012 machine and it does have some limitations due to the GPU. On the other hand, it has 16gbytes of RAM and a 1TB solid state drive which have very positive impacts on speed. I tend to lean towards my MacBook and Premier when editing. I just can\u2019t get used to the touch screen interface on the Win10 machines. ",

They can use what ever they like between them and the staff photographer they have 5 Macs and 1 PC. Its\u2019 thier choice. We have 3D artists and modelers on staff, they choose to use PC\u2019s for the better video cards that can be installed than what you can get on Macs right now. We have a dozen graphic artists and art directors who all choose to use Macs. Again its up to them what they use. Another manager and I have both Mac\u2019s and PCs on our desks. I use both equally but do all my graphics related work on the Mac and business stuff on the PC. One advantage Macs continue to have over PCs is the dimensional accuracy. PCs have always a problem drawing to screen true and accurately sized graphics. PC users are just used to it, as Mac users are to theirs. However, many creative professionals continue to use Macs even though they have fallen far behind PCs in total performance because they are more WYSIWYG, they manage fonts better, when drawing to screen everything looks like what it will print like in Postscript. And sure some of it is simply habit. ",

Some individuals edit in Adobe Premiere on the Mac, but one can also edit in Premiere on a PC. It really boils down to what system, or software you prefer, and the capacity of capability the system has. I prefer to do video editing on my Mac because I am addicted to Final Cut Pro X and its\u2019 features. I prefer to execute photo editing and animation on a PC, all day! When choosing your intended system, you will want to do research on the system compatibility of the applications you wish to use in the future. For example, some applications will have more features/easier to access features based on the origin of system in which the application was created. I hope this helps you!
