            "answer_text": "There are many fine ones. After seeing the latest \u201cTrue Detective\u201d I\u2019m going with Mahershala Ali. It is actually hard to know since so many take crappy parts for the bucks (Samuel Jackson, I\u2019m mean you) so you don\u2019t get to see much finesse. Denzel Washington was better in his original TV show set in Boston than he is in movies nowadays (\u201cTraining Day\u201d excepted). I though Blair Underwood was wonderful until he disappeared. Morgan Freeman was great in \u201cNurse Betty\u201d. Jeffrey Wright is often wasted. Why don\u2019t these guys do Shakespeare so we can see then let loose? Laurence Fishburne seems an exception. And the black Brits keep getting those juicy roles. ",

Anyway\u2026.don\u2019t think there is one best. How \u2019bout Forest Whitaker, Andre Braugher, Ossie Davis, James Earl Jones, Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames, Michael B. Jordan, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Paul Winfield, Anthony Mackie, Morris Chestnut, Delroy Lindo, Morgan Freeman, Courtney B. Vance, and potentially the late Chadwick Boseman? There are so many other fine actors to add to this list, but you get my drift. (Thinking about this topic reminded me it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen Robert Townsend\u2019s \u201cHollywood Shuffle\u201d with the famous \u201cBlack Acting School\u201d sequence. ) ",
