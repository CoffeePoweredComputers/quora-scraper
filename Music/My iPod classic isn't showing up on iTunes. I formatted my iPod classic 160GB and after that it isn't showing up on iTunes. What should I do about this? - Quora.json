            "answer_text": "The issue is probably of driver (Apple Mobile Device USB Driver). If you are using Windows, connect your iPod and, Go to Devices and Printers, and then find Apple Mobile Device USB Driver. If I am right, it should have a small yellow triangle (err) on it. Right click on it, and click on troubleshoot. Windows should then tell you that there is a problem with device driver, and then would try to fix it. It will fix it. This should do it. If not, then follow what Vikram Ramnath has advised. That is probably the last thing you can do with an iDevice. If still it doesn't work, go to Apple. Although, I believe, they would not provide a solution except from advising you to buy a new iPod (touch or nano most probably), you never know who you find in the store. Good luck! ",
