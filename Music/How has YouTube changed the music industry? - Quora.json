            "answer_text": "YouTube changed the music industry mainly in the following ways: by allowing musicians to distribute their music (videos) and get exposure for themselves and their music (videos) so they can be discovered. Musicians such as Justin Bieber were able to get their start after being noticed on YouTube and there have been several more who started making videos before being noticed and making it big. I talked about this more in an answer to a previous question, found here: Mart\u00edn Medina's answer to Which musical artists had their start on YouTube?. Musicians are able to showcase their music with the world through YouTube by making videos, usually covers of other songs. Smaller artists who are lesser known have also gained some popularity by posting videos on YouTube. These videos were not only limited to music but also allowed them to engage with fans and develop a strong online fan base. Furthermore, they also were able to share their music and music videos as well reaching more people than possible before YouTube. Also, YouTube became a platform where artists large and small could distribute their music videos. Before the days of YouTube music videos were mainly found made by big names and seen on MTV. Now with things like YouTube they can easily and cheaply distribute their videos with things like VEVO being used by bigger artists. In fact it is very rare to see music videos on MTV nowadays. Regardless of the budget of the video YouTube allows for distribution to millions of viewers. Some musicians have even broken a billion video views and their popularity has exploded. One musician I can think of is PSY who has his Gangnam Style video go viral and reached global popularity overnight after becoming an internet sensation. This is not just limited to a few cases but countless of artists have blown up after their video has gone viral some I can name off the top of my head include Rebecca Black, and Macklemore. Even if a musician doesn\u2019t have their video go viral they are still able distribute it to thousands of people regardless of the budget of the video. There have also been some negatives to YouTube in the music industry particularly regarding copyright. Many artists have gotten quite upset about YouTube\u2019s policy on copyright believing they allow people who infringe on their copyright to go relatively unpunished. This is however a much more complex topic that extends far beyond the music industry so I won\u2019t discuss it in detail. Overall, YouTube has certainly changed the music industry and fundamentally disrupted how videos are distributed and shared. ",

            "answer_text": "YouTube changed the music industry by giving content creators a mainstream platform, and by that I mean a force against corrupt copyright laws. In order to understand why YouTube is a popular destination and what it means for the future of independent artists, we have to understand copyright laws. You see this guy? His name is Don Henley. Don Henley does not like his music on YouTube or even anyone covering his songs. In fact, he said to a Congressional hearing that he pays 65 \u201cminions\u201d minimum wage to find uploads of his songs by anyone on YouTube for its immediate removal. Don Henley testified to Congress arguing that we should strengthen copyright laws.  However what Don Henley doesn\u2019t know or understand its that, when Don was making music with the Eagles there was no such thing as copyright. In fact it could be argued that guys like the Eagles stole licks from Chuck Berry. Beatles stole licks from Chuck Berry. Musicians made money from selling copies of albums, but there was no copyright of a sound recording. This is how disc jokeys were able to broadcast music for free by literally spinning records they bought and playing them over the air, and the artist obliged because it was considered free promotion. That was our public airwaves and it was our free right to listen to music. That is how we cultivated the artist renaissance of the 1960\u2019s counterculture. However in 1978 for the first time in history, Congress decided to make sound recordings copyrightable and thus started a new era of music labels that could sue local radio stations and local businesses for using music without permissions. It was a new way to make money based on lawsuits and finning jaywalkers. This gave birth to guys like Napster that started the first rebellion to the online music world. When YouTube hit the scene after it was bought by Google, it gave legitimacy to what Napster started. The online world of streaming music. The irony for guys like Don Henley is, his music would get more exposure if it were online for free. If you want the next generation of listeners to hear your music, it has to be promoted for free whether that is online or on the radio. Google has been fighting every copyright extension every decade, and we are winning the fight because no matter what people will find a way to listen to music if they can\u2019t afford it. The loss of sales argument is also illogical, because the people listening for free because they can\u2019t afford to buy music, wouldn\u2019t have paid money anyways. Is Don Henley really threatened by a 15 year old in his mom\u2019s basement? I truly believe that websites like YouTube give a level playing field to small artists against the giant record labels which have consolidated into three major companies. UMG, Sony, and WMG. It\u2019s so powerful because it\u2019s giving you and me a platform to create and publish our own work without without fear of going to prison. Copyright laws have become too powerful and long, and the very bands that rally against websites like YouTube were the very bands that stole licks and lines off Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters and Little Richard. The hypocrisy is incredible. ",
