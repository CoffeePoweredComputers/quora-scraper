            "answer_text": "Here are my top 25 hip-hop albums of the last ten years in no order. I\u2019m not including mixtapes even though there are phenomenal ones like Friday Night Lights and Acid Rap. Tha Carter III (2008) by Lil Wayne is a phenomenal album and arguably his best. His lyricism is simply on another level.808s and Heartbreak (2008)- Although this album is a mixture of hip-hop and electropop, it is immaculately produced and Kanye\u2019s most influential album.Only Built for Cuban Linx II (2009)- One of the most underrated albums of the year. It\u2019s one of the best rap albums of 2009, probably the best. Raekwon is one of the best lyricists alive.Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009) is Kid Cudi\u2019s debut and remains his best album. It\u2019s influence is massive.The Ecstatic (2009) by Mos Def is a brilliant piece of work and has a very eclectic sound. He raps about a plethora of issues with penetrating depth.My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) by Kanye West is one of my favorite albums of all time. It\u2019s not only the best rap album of 2010, but the best album of 2010. There\u2019s a reason every critic worth their salt gave it a perfect or near perfect review.Teflon Don (2010) is Rick Ross\u2019s best album and filled with great songs like Aston Martin Music, one of my favorite rap songs of the decade.Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty (2010)- Most definitely is one of the best rap albums of 2010. Big Boi, has often been in the shadow of Andre 3000, but his solo album demonstrates his immense skill and lyricism.Take Care (2011) Drake\u2019s second album is his best in my opinion and filled with great songs such as HYFR, Marvin\u2019s Song, Headlines, and so many others. It\u2019s an amazing album.Watch the Throne (2011)- This album saw too titans of the rap game, Jay Z and Kanye, come together and deliver something riveting. The lyricism, audacity, bombastic production, and social commentary on this album make it a great one.Section 80 (2011) is Kendrick Lamar\u2019s debut album is his rawest and filled with amazing songs such as Hiipower, A.D.H.D, and Keisha\u2019s song. It\u2019s an underrated gem in his catalog.Good Kid M.A.A.D City (2012) is Kendrick\u2019s second album, but the first to win him national attention and Grammy nominations. It\u2019s a brilliant coming of age tale from an introverted, introspective youth caught up in the violence of Compton, California. It\u2019s an amazing album.Life is Good (2012) is Nas\u2019s best album in the last decade. Known for having both classics and duds in his catalog, this album is much closer to the first. Nas\u2019s lyricism and emotional depth are evident on this album.Yeezus (2013) is polarizing, abrasive, obnoxious.. and brilliant. It\u2019s one of Kanye\u2019s greatest projects sonically and that\u2019s saying something. It\u2019s riveting and songs like Black Skinhead and New Slaves are shock you with their righteous anger and unmitigated gall.Doris (2013) by Earl Sweatshirt is one of the most underrated albums on the list. Yet, there are simply so many great things about this album from its gritty production to Earl\u2019s unconventional rhyme scheme.Run the Jewels 2 (2014)- This album is also one of the most underrated on here but Killer Mike always delivers. There\u2019s not much to say except in terms of lyricism, it\u2019s one of the best.2014 Forest Hills Drive (2014)- Although it isn\u2019t as critically lauded as many of these albums, it\u2019s vulnerability, production, and positive themes make it one of my favorite.To Pimp a Butterfly (2015)- Undoubtedly the best rap album of 2015. Probably the best album of any genre of 2015. Kendrick delivered a strong social justice album, focused on issues which plague black America. Not only that, he did it brilliantly.Coloring Book (2016) Chance\u2019s debut album is filled with dazzling production, intriguing lyricism, and catered to Christian sensibilities in the most fun way possible. It\u2019s a very enjoyable album.DAMN (2017) not only won Best Rap Album at the Grammys, but won Kendrick a Pulitzer for good reason. Although not as good as To Pimp a Butterfly or Good Kid in my opinion, this was a phenomenal album which shows Kendrick is capable of out putting great album after great album. It\u2019s very well-produced and radiating with depth.4:44 (2017) is Jay Z\u2019s brilliant, most recent work besides his collab with Beyonc\u00e9. 4:44 is his best album in a very long time, probably since Americans Gangster. If ones likes mature rap and clever lyricism which often goes over one\u2019s head, check out this album. The Story of OJ and Smile are phenomenal.Daytona (2018) by Pusha T is short, but that\u2019s the only criticism that can be levied against it. The production is outstanding and lush (thanks to Kanye), Push is one of rap\u2019s best lyricists which shows on here, and it\u2019s the best rap album of 2018.Astroworld (2018) Sonically immaculate, Travis Scott\u2019s album is the best produced album of the year. It\u2019s fun and the vast majority of the songs are simply great to listen to.Kids See Ghosts (2018) is an album that both Kid Cudi and Kanye delivered on. It\u2019s outstanding with its rock influences, unconventional samples, and psychedelic feel. Easily one of the best of the year.Invasion of Privacy (2010) is Cardi\u2019s debut and shows the immense potential she had as a rapper. A mixture of pop, Latin and rap, this is an enjoyable, fun album that showcases her talent and versatility. I enjoy nearly every song on the album, especially Bodak Yellow and Be Careful.",
