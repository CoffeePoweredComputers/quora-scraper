You see the amount of bashing you will get if you do it. Even if the stylists dress you in something that is close to blackface, again its 2020, please speak up about it. Its annoying to see fans having to use the \u201cits because they are ignorant and are from South Korea\u201d card every time. Like for fans that have been in the fandom for a while, its just disappointing every time it happens.Leaving Mnet and other elimination shows in 2019.After seeing X1 disband in this manner, its just a waste of time to get into these groups from these elimination shows if you are going to get hurt and offended by this, even though the group is gonna disband anyway. Not to mention these members and contestants don\u2019t really get that popular after the group disbands (like a whole lot of them went solo and besides Kang Daniel and Chungha, everyone else doesn\u2019t really get to do much). Like look what happened to The Unit\u2019s final line up, no one even cared even if so many people watched the show.Hate on couples and taking couples so seriously.This applies to all Korean celebrity couples not just idol couples. But when Song Jongki and Song Hye Ko divorced, people went ballistic on the internet. Like the people in their surrounding environment never go through divorce. In the first place, who makes a statue of this couple like that. Thats already taking this so seriously no matter how great the drama they starred in was.This applies for fandoms who get easily offended but please stop with this nonsense. Is k-pop that serious, where if some celebrity makes misunderstanding with your kpop group and you take it upon yourself to go and hunt them down online over some small comment and make hashtags on twitter over the situation?Fancams on twitterShould be officially bannedThis is probably just me, but idols who go on vlive or instagram live and only say a few things and stare at the comments, and then leave within 10minutes. Like I said its probably just me, but I hate seeing that. I\u2019ve seen it so many times, and I just don\u2019t understand the appeal on it and why idols do it. My friends on facebook do that, and I literally banned that notification for almost every friend that have went live on facebook.",

            "answer_text": "I love this question and I have a lot of things to say so prepare yourself for another \u201clong ass ride\u201d on my account let\u2019s go Looks: Typical Kpop makeup     I don\u2019t think there\u2019s something I hate more than overused gradient lips and excessive brown eyeshadows on male idols. Colorful hair  Colorful hair was something unusual in 1st and 2nd gens, we all heard about that scandal with blonde hair girl group, but in 3rd and 4th gen it almost an obligation to have crazy colorful hairstyles. When the trend started it was kind of a rebel, and now all these young boys and girls look the same. I\u2019m somewhat familiar with 3rd gen and very slightly aware of the 4th, so here are some random younger groups:     The only difference I see is the amount of members, and it\u2019s not racism, just dumb Kpop trends that make idols look like they just left the clone factory  Blonde hair on male idols    And my personal pain \u2014 blonde Jin  Idk I can\u2019t see him with light hair, it\u2019s like his face was created for dark shades  There are really a few male idols that can rock blonde and light hair, and when I say a few I mean 1%. Crop tops on male idols  Shorts and mini skirts for female artists  I have nothing against this kind of outfits but I wish there were more pants and suits on the stage Kids clothes  This kind of concepts makes me \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c Military inspired outfits    I hate any kind of war romanticization and especially the one that targets kids and especially especially if it's inspired by nazi uniforms Music: Latin vibes stop stealing jobs from Latin American artists lol unnecessary rap there were so many songs brutally murdered by rap verses, I can\u2019t even count unnecessary and random collabs business is business but I\u2019m not interested in supporting collabs for the sake of collabs Fans: Kpop fancams need to die forever. I don\u2019t get how all this mess started and why some alternatively gifted twitter users decided to post their irrelevant faves under twits about suicides, sexual assault, natural disasters and whatever but every time I notice a fancam I hope with my whole heart not to see my faves there. \u2757\ufe0f\u2728And the reason we are all here:\u2728\u2757\ufe0f Variety shows tropes I HATE: Korean beauty standards Every f*cking show I watched spends time to praise someone for fitting into SoKor beauty standards. And every time it looks random af, like they discuss some sh*t and suddenly the MC says smth like \u201cwow you have such a small face\u201d or \u201comg let me touch your milk skin\u201d. I think I should start doing it with my clients, like \u201cyeah sorry man you just got sentenced to 15 years in prison but god damn that V-lined jawline\u201d or \u201cyeah sad you were stabbed with a knife but hope it won\u2019t affect your MiLk SkIn\u201d. Honestly I don\u2019t even find their standards attractive except for pale skin, but even though I\u2019m the palest person I\u2018ve ever met and I LOVE it, I\u2019m tired of seeing the normalization of bullying based on a skin shade. Maknae Another overused thing. Who tf decided that it\u2019s an extremely funny thing to bully the youngest for ratings? I get that it\u2019s scripted and everything but it\u2019s not entertaining to watch, all I want is to close the vid Ugly members Probably the dumbest thing of all. It\u2019s when the group collectively decides which member is \u201cthe ugliest\u201d and joke about it on every variety show. I don\u2019t even get why \u201crank members based on their visuals\u201d is a thing in Korean shows. I never in my entire life found jokes about Daesung or J-Hope being \u201cthe visual hole\u201d funny. First of all they are hot af, and secondly, no, bullying is not a comedy. Short member The same as with the ugly member. Every single show has a part about height. Yeah, we got it, Taeyang, Jimin, Jinhwan are short, ok we understood, thank you. Small eyes I think it\u2019s time for Koreans to accept that they are Asians, small monolid eyes is not something to shame people about, I\u2019m tired of this bullsh*t. most popular members The fact that a person is not the most popular and successful member doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok to ignore them for 80% of the show Imitations Idk, maybe Korean audience really likes it but I find it boring and unfunny, especially when everything screams that the person was asked to prepare some imitations ",
