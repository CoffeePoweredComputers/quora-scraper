            "answer_text": "iTunes: Pro: lets you play music files that are on your computer. These can be downloaded songs from the web, songs bought through iTunes, or songs ripped from CDs or what have you. You can also add music to iPods, etc., and can burn CDs. Con: you can't play any music you don't already own.Spotify: Pro: lets you listen to essentially any music ever. You can choose what tracks to play, and you can listen as much as you want. Con: unless you pay money, you can only listen to it from your computer, and you need to listen to occasional ads. (If you do, though, it works on mobile devices as well as offline.)Pandora: Pro: lets you play music you've never heard before, in the same vein as music you love. Discover artists you like but haven't heard, and listen to some great music. Con: Very little control over what songs play, and you need to listen to frequent ads.

            "answer_text": "\"Those who have tried Spotify know it's like a magical version of iTunes in which you've already bought every song in the world.\" - Wired And Spotify is actually better than that: you don't have to sync all the songs between different devices, just stream them via wi-fi or 3G (offline playlists are also supported). Unlike Spotify, Pandora is not a on-demand streaming service, you cannot decide what songs to play. ",
