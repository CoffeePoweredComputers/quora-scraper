From what I've read she was talking of her old self having died at 16 - a self that had many friends. Now she is living in the persona of \"Billie Eilish.\" There is always the danger, when becoming public property, of losing oneself into that image as you move increasingly into the public eye - with its demands and expectations. Not everyone can deal with it or be at peace with it - and I suspect a lot of people try to escape from it - through all kinds of avenues - as they wake up to what is going on. ",

I may not be so dramatic in what or how I say things these days but actually I still feel the same way about the change in me when I left school and went to college. No, I never grew into becoming a well known singer with a public persona (hence her saying that she was \u201creincarnated in the figure of \u201cBillie Eilish\u201d )but I kind of get what she means. I certainly don\u2019t find it disturbing. ",

That said - or typed - being the cheerful bag o\u2019 beans she is, \u2018dying at 16\u2019 is nothing but a metaphor\u2026rejoice in the fact that now she\u2019s alive! ",
