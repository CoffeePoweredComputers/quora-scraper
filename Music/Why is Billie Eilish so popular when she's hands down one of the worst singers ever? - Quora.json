            "answer_text": "Hands out her depression sets her apart from everyone else, consequently making her popular because she resonates with many teens, and not so much adults as you might have noticed. Her stories of wanting to end herself, hinting at suicide, to straight up making a song about killing herself, it attracts many younger people. I don't want to assume anything, but I personally think that her depression gained popularity because our Gen Z is unfortunately in that pinnacle of dealing with depression, and by having someone to look up to, we perceive the fact that we can relate to someone. At the same token, this has lead many people to delve further into her depression for the sole purpose of profit. You have interviews, talk shows, and now her aforementioned songs where her depression practically lifts her in a unconventional sense. So, I agree with you that she's a bad artist, but that pales in comparison when millions of people can reach out to a 18 year old, in order to grasp that feeling of relating to someone. ",

            "answer_text": "She's not one the worst singers ever. Not having a belty voice doesn't make you a bad singer. But she can belt, she nailed the belt in the bond theme during the Brits award show performance. She is mostly popular among teens because we can resonate to her. Her music is dark, edgy and sad. She sings about global warming and anti-drug abuse. Her visuals in the music video are as good as her music. ",
