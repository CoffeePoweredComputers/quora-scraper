            "answer_text": "You need rubber bands and any liquid that stains cloth. You can buy clothing dye from hobby stores, or you can use some household natural dyes. Experiment with an old white shirt first, so you see the effects of patterns made by the rubber bands: pick up your shirt with two fingers, put the \"point\" through a rubber band, twist the band & put the point through the \"O\" of the rubber again. Do this until the rubber band is used up/wrapped around the point of cloth. Be sure the rubber band is tight around the cloth. This process does not have to be neat, in fact the sloppier you bind the rubber band around the cloth,  the more interesting the final pattern! Place the rubber band at least 1 to 2 inches down from the point before you begin to wind. Leave the point of the cloth free/unbound by the rubber band -- this will give you the \"eye\" of the concentric circles that are characteristic of tie dye.  Where ever the rubber band is touching will block the dye from seeping into cloth. Do the rubber band wrapping all over the shirt -- in the end, you'll get a shirt all twisted up with rubber bands. Immerse the shirt in the dye. Commercial dyes will come with instructions, so read & follow them. Or if you want to try a natural dye -- (you may in the beginning just to get the hang of it and experiment with patterns) -- try steeping your rubber banded shirt in very strong bucket of black tea - you can make it in advance in a large tea kettle, hot tea best, but cold works too, although the color won't be as strong & pattern not as distinct. The bucket should be big enough so you can immerse the shirt. The stronger the tea the better. Let it steep for at least an hour or more, stir occasionally to ensure distribution of color. . The longer you soak, the stronger the color. When time is up, rinse in cold water. Undo rubber bands and Viola!  Hang to dry in shade, iron shirt when dry. Remember if you are using a natural dye, colors will fade with each washing/exposure to elements (e.g. sun). It's lots of fun to tie dye whether you use natural/commercial dye. Oh, one more thing, use gloves to put your shirt in the commercial dye -- otherwise you will have funny looking hands for a couple of days! Same for natural dyes, although they are more forgiving! Have fun -- it's a great group activity too. Everyone compares shirts! ",
