            "answer_text": "You can add music from YouTube's own library. They have done a pretty good job at listing down all possible genre's of music with royalty free music. What that means is you can upload your videos and then select the music that suits the video, then add it as an overlay to the video. There are no copyright infringements here. The only catch is that not all music is awesome, they are more like fillers and background music and you will need to listen to a whole lot of music from their library to choose the right one that suits your video's mood. Another one problem I found is that sometimes the music's timing does not match the videos. For example, the video might be 10 minute long but the music only 6 minutes. Then you have to either loop in the music or fade it out at 6 minutes. Same thing for long videos. Finding long music for long videos is kind of tricky. There is a neat work around though - http://news.manikarthik.com/long-music-videos/technology/how-to/. (Disclaimer - I wrote this blog article.) Hope you find it useful.  ",
