            "answer_text": "The Anatolian Gr`eek identity was based on religion [Orthodox Christianity]. Historically, it is not possible to speak of a Gr`eek identity in terms of a nation [or ethnicity] in Anatolia. The historical records also provide no evidence regarding the systematic assimilation, or forced conversion of the Christian folks in Anatolia under Turkish rule. On the other hand, it is true that some people and families accepted Islam either to pay less taxes, or to become civil servants. Considering the fact that the basic condition of assimilating people is [forcing them] to replace their languages and religions, this had never been the case for Christians under Turkish rule. For instance, even though there are Muslim communities in countries such as Bosnia and Albania today, they do not call themselves \u2018Turks\u2019, or speak Turkish, and still keep their identity and culture. The inhabitants found this renewed Turkish rule [in Greece] preferable to that of the Venetians. The taxes were lighter, the administration was less efficient and therefore less harsh, and the \u201cOttoman infidel\u201d was much more tolerant than the Roman Catholic. ( \u2014 The Greek Struggle for Independence, p. 5 .. The Unification of Greece, p. 10 / Douglas Dakin \u2014 ) Under Ottoman rule, the Gr`eek Orthodox Patriarchate of Istanbul was officially recognized, granted autonomy, and the Orthodox church of Cyprus was also reopened after a 300-years-long closure under the Catholic Venetian rule. Ignorance of the Ottoman period perpetuates the belief of most Gr`eeks in the truth of the 19th century nationalist myth of the \u201csecret schools/kryfo scholeio\u201d, which has been ably exposed by Alkis Angelou, Alexis Politis and others. According to this myth, the Ottomans did not allow the Gr`eeks to build schools, churches, or to teach the Gr`eek language, so that Gr`eek children had to resort to attending school lessons given under the cover of darkness by local priests in the churches.

We Turks are mixture of Central Asian Turkmens and Hellenized Native Anatolian Turks came from Southwestern Central Asia(today's Turkmenistan) to Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert(1071). There are no Turkish identity at that times, because they were called as Seljuk Turks or Turkmens. When Turks came to Anatolia, they met Hellenized local people (descendants of Hittites, Phrigians, Hurrians, Galatians etc.) and today's Turkish identity is consisted. So Turks became mixture of Turkmens and Greco-Anatolians. But it doesn't mean they're Muslimized Greeks. Also many Turks who took Dna test comes out as 1/2 Turkmen + 1/2 Greco-Anatolian.

One way this has occurred is the devsirme (blood tax) system whereby Christian subjects of the Ottomans had to give up their eldest sons to serve the Ottoman state in the civil and military services, notably in the Jannissary corps. They would be converted to Islam, but many rose through the ranks and became powerful, some even becoming viziers of the Empire. These people would have become culturally assimilated (\u2018Turkicized\u2019). Another way is that existing Indo-European groups in Anatolia (including some Anatolian Greeks) became culturally assimilated in the centuries of Seljuk an Ottoman rule. ",
