            "answer_text": "Story time\u2026\u2026 1.Laptop (2012):  This movie is one of the newest concepts ever implemented in the Bengali cineworld where a laptop serves as a common thread of unity among various complex characters and a key to various complicated relationships. Relation explored in this manner is a new approach which did no go well with the audience back then especially when it involved concepts of infertility and sperm donation and a father searching his child on this basis. Social dogmas overshadowed such a gem of art. It dealt with relationships between an author and a typist, a doctor, a hotel manager and a taxi driver, all their relations intertwined through the stored data of the laptop which when reaches them transforms their lives forever. The major plus point of the movie lies in its clear, nuanced and subtle narrative especially when addressing such practical issues which has no room for melodrama. The glare and curtness of the film really deserve palls of applause. 2.Jhumura (2014):  It is a glorious attempt to revive the gradually diminishing aura of Jhumur, a folk art form. It is an emotional film that does not go high on tears but portrays life, love and struggles of Jhumur artists on the silver screen well balanced. Nature and music have been blended into each other well enough. It follows two parallel stories of journalists Rwik and Sahana and village tribals Kanchan and Kusum. The film is presented in form of a beautiful poetry with amazing visual tapestry- rustic and serene. The ending is a twist which remains unexplained but leaves an indelible impression. 3.Khaad (2014):  This film illustrates a train strike which brings together a group of tourists from different strata of society and different walks of life at New Mal Junction. The priest among them arranges a bus from a church for themselves to reach North Bengal. Howsoever, as fate would have it, the bus meets with a terrible accident by falling down a cliff into an abyss, but miraculously the people are saved from major mishap. Unable to arrange anything for their rescue, they decide to spend the night there itself and indulge in a game of confession where individuals confess some of their dark secrets to get rid of its burden in that abyss itself and start afresh the next morning. Next what happens forms the film with an ending that is bound to send a chill down your spine. When you feel you have understood the film, the next moment you get to realize that the director has played with your mind in the trickiest of ways. It is really a 'khaad' which has ceaseless layers of layered emotions. 4.Sonar Pahar (2014):  Upama, a 72 year old retired school teacher resides in a dilapidated house resigned to her fate of abandonment. On a fateful day, she is introduced to a 7-year old orphan Bitlu by a NGO owner and they form a great bond in midst of their respective sorrows. One day, both of them goes missing and then Soumyo, Upama's son begins to search for them and rest is what forms the core of the movie. This film captures the sweetness of bonding between an aged and a child for the first time on the Tollywood celluloid. Parallely it depicts the story of bitter solitude in old age of people when abandoned by children. Also it makes us realize that we value a person the most when he or she is not with us. This movie is a platform for self-introspection and tribute to the sacrificing parents. 5.Dakbaksho (2015):  Who says Bengali cinema has lost momentum! You just need eyes to choose and skill to measure. This opportunity is provided by this psychological thriller. It is a tryst with experiments. While our world is gradually getting enshrouded in virtual world of social networking sites, e-mails, Whatsapp and so on, it is a reminiscence of the bygone eras of hand written letters and its better emotional connect. It covers two parallel stories: First one is that of a mysterious person who drops sinister letters with ploys of murder regularly in an abandoned post box unnamed and unaddressed never to be delivered. Who is he? What is he upto? Motive? Second is of a documentary filmmaker Srija who has secluded herself from her profession due to unveiled reasons. Here, a freelancer photographer Abhro enters her life. His existence is a complete mystery and his presence does not evoke good vibes. What is his purpose of such sudden appearance? How these two stories seamlessly merges into each other and answers the questions on the pretext on the letter box forms the length of the film. 6.Kadambari (2015):  This film retrospects into the past and puts forth the story of Kadambari Devi, the daughter-in-law of the renowned Tagore family, wife of Jyotirindranath Tagore and sister-in-law of Rabindranath Tagore. She, at the age of nine entered the Tagore household. Being only two years older to Rabindranath Tagore they became very good friends. Four months after Tagore married Mrinalini Devi, she committed suicide. This film has attempted well to divulge her life and explain her bonding with Tagore and succeeded skillfully in it. The film is elegant and entertaining simultaneously thanks to its eloquent execution. It never deviates it course from maintaining the regal and inspiring factor in her life. It is a rare masterpiece which needs to cherished both in forms of art and storytelling. 7.Monchora (2016):  It follows the story of Dibakar, a kleptomaniac turned thief who comes to Choudhury family in search of a family heirloom, a precious red ruby which is worshipped by the family as there God the 'Surjo moni'. However, he is tangled in emotions and loyalty when he meets Nanda and is entrusted by her grandfather. This is not where the story becomes tangible but where another chunk of mystery starts unfurling and gradually coalesce together into a perfect flawless masterpiece. It has thrill, dark humour, romance and mystery amalgamated in perfect proportion with excellent performances of the cast creating a simplistic marvel on screen. 7.Curzoner Kolom (2017):  It is a treasure hunt film which leaves no element of mystery, thrill and adventure untouched. It is about a newspaper reporting about a hundred year old gold pen with a 10 carat diamond of Lord Curzon which was lost. The pen can be traced with solving a puzzle of riddles which gradually involves many people and numerous places associated with it. It draws the attention of many people both with right and foul intentions. The hunt for the historically priceless pen constitutes the film. A marvellous treat for all adventure loving cinegoers, this film is one of the unnoticed masterpiece. 9.Durga Sohay (2017):  It follows the story of a woman named Durga and her transformation from astray to main stream of life when helped and surrounded supportive people. She enters a wealthy Basak family in guise of a nurse. She is gradually revealed to be an accomplice in a dacoity planned to be executed on the night of Dashami. However, she is caught before hand and there begins her journey. Initially hesistant and apprehensive, the Basak family decides to give her a second chance to reinforce her positive side. With amazing cinematography it weaves human values and transitoriness of human mind in the backdrop of Durga Puja with pure essence of Bangaliana. 10.Samantaral (2017):  This psychological thriller attempts to break through the shackles of taboos from the conservative mindset of people. It narrates the story of a boy named Arko who tries to mend his uncle Sujan's life who is assumed to be mentally retarded due to his dreaming nature. However gradually it unfolds the darkest secrets hidden with the family and why Sujan is locked up from the outside world. The film is emotional on the misery of Sujan while is as ruthless as it can get with so called \u201csane\u201d characters of the society who are absolutely pathetic at their heart. This film is in complete rebellion with the society which judges people on their gender and not on their values. The ending leaves us empathetic with Sujan but gives us ample reasons to be proud of him and change our outlook towards such people. 11.Happy Pill (2018):  Happy pill is an honest and successful effort to make the viewers happy. It lifts your mood and makes you see the positivities even through the direst of difficulties. Siddhartha, a bright medical student is forced to dropout from college owning to family issues and financial crisis. He loses the purpose to live when despite all his efforts, his father ailing of cancer passes away and his sister suffers from inferiority complex and his mother is demoralized. Almost on the verge of ending his life, he meets a girl propagating happiness despite all oddities of life being hurled upon her. His life takes a turn at this junction where he realizes the meaning of true happiness as inner happiness and he invents happy pills to cure people of their worries. Whether it is just an escapade or a true medicine, the decision rests with the audience. It opens a new door of inner happiness and psychological peace as an unparalled perspective of life. 12.Kabir (2018):  The film incepts with the news of bomb blasts in Mumbai. Then a burkha-clad woman Yasmin Khatun entrains a train to Kolkata from Mumbai and she is accompanied by decent-looking Abir Chatterjee. Yasmin's father and cousin sister is held hostage by Abir's men who reveals himself to be Altaf Kabir. Then begins an investigative journey from Mumbai to Kolkata where the characters are not what they seem to be, the story is actually not what is appears to be and when you feel you have deciphered the code you get to know the code is not what it seemed. It glues the viewers to the screen throughout its entire duration with its engrossing thrill and exquisition. The ending is absolutely satisfying but unexpected and joins all the points of the movie. It is the first glaring attempt on the big screen of Bengali cinema to elucidate the statistics and aftermaths of terrorism prevailing in the country. It is also a tribute to all the officers who work day in and out to efface such a gory. 13.Uronchondi (2018):  It is road tale of three women- a runaway bride Meenu, a victim of domestic violence Bindiya and a neglected aged mother together when they embark on a truck journey in search of solace to an undecided destination and get emotionally connected to each other. It is a mellifluous but strong summon to the viewers to take the rein of their lives in their own coordination and severe the shackles of oppression that lie heavy on their souls. It acclaims that age is no bar to embrace our dreams and choices. While the film leaves no scope to demean the dominating attribute of patriarchal society, it does not forget to paint the soft side of men in form of Chotu. The rural backdrop of the film- the rustic enigma of North Bengal and its perfect cinematography render a touch of commonness and relatability to the film. 14.Robibar (2019):  Robibaar is a tale of a fateful Sunday when Sayani, working on fraudster's psychology meets Asimavo, her former lover after 15 years of their separation. On his insistence, despite her reluctance, she agrees to spent time with him and thereby lands into complexities of feelings. It delivers both the charisma and peril of walking down the memory lane to revisit them. The film delves deeper into fraud psychology as Asimava is fraud. Will he con Sayani too or not? The actors have played their parts well with conviction and sincerity and their efforts along with the impressive storyline needs to be lauded. It is one of the rarest film of its genre that does not lose its track with unbearable melodrama and hard-to-believe conclusion. It is therefore a treat to watch. 15.Sweater (2019):  It followes the story of two sisters, Tuku and Sree. While the former one is shy and reserved, the other one is smart and outspoken. Tuku is having difficulty in finding a groom as she has no talent in extracurricular activity as required as per societal norms. She is asked to learn knitting by her prospective mother-in-law. She goes to Darjeeling for so. There she experiences real taste of living and different facets of life which completely transforms her outlook towards life. She develops self-confidence and turns into a mature human. While Sree being humiliated by her prospective groom for her greed and misbehavior turns into a reserved but balanced person. Both the sisters undergo self-analysis and ultimately choses the better path of life. The film strives to inform that a girl's independence lies in her own devision. Many such films have been lost in the darkness and very few people are aware of them. That is my list for the day. Additions are most welcome. Thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "Do you know who this guy is?  I don\u2019t think a lot of people will recognize him. He is Pradipta Bhattacharyya, a director who has made only two feature-length films till date. He made this film called Bakita Byaktigato (Bengali: \u09ac\u09be\u0995\u09bf\u099f\u09be \u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf\u0997\u09a4, English Translation: Rest is Personal) which was released in 2013.  I am sure, many casual movie-goers or movie-watchers may not even have heard of its existence. This movie won the 61st National Film Awards for Best Feature Film in Bengali. It\u2019s one of the best movies I have watched till date, and I watch a lot of movies in multiple languages, not just in Bengali. The movie has a myriad of layers and themes, the central of them being Love (or is it?). The film opens with an amateur documentary film-maker Pramit (played by Ritwick Chakraborty) breaking the fourth wall and asking you a bunch of simple fundamental questions about love. Like \"How do two people fall in love?\" and \"What is love according to you?\". It is established that he is making a documentary about the general idea of love. Random common people pop in with their different perspectives. But soon, the film-maker reveals his actual agenda; he wants to find love for himself. He confesses to the audience that he never had any proper relationship and never experienced love. He is desperate to fall in love, and the primary reason for making the documentary is to understand love and experiencing it on his own. Soon, out of desperation, he decides to propose random people over the phone, on the internet, and even in person. This, as you can expect, doesn\u2019t bring him any success and pushes him towards more sorrow. Accepting the fact that he might not find love, he tries to move on. But one day he meets an astrologer who tells him about a village called Mohini (the word literally means seductive in Bengali). If someone goes to Mohini alone, he/she falls for someone. If a couple goes, their love only gets stronger. And if two people, one in love with another but the other one who doesn\u2019t reciprocate the feeling go together then the one not in love is bound to fall, eventually. Pramit doesn\u2019t believe him at first, but the astrologer suggests him to go and meet some people who have actually gone to Mohini and experienced the magic on their own. After meeting these people, Pramit, although still not totally convinced, gets intrigued by this whole thing and decides to go. What follows after is the actual film, which soaks you into its beautiful world, charms you, twists your mind and leaves you with a Birdman/Spirited Away-esque climax (only categorically) in the end. The Movie is available on Youtube and Zee5. For a detailed explanation of the movie, refer to Ajay Sharma's answer to What is the Bengali movie Bakita Byaktigoto all about? What is its underlying meaning? Apur Panchali (Bengali: \u0985\u09aa\u09c1\u09b0 \u09aa\u09be\u0981\u099a\u09be\u09b2\u09bf, English Translation: Apu\u2019s Ballad) by Kaushik Ganguly is another beautiful movie and probably one of the best biopics made in Bengali which I don\u2019t find mentioned often in mainstream discussions. The movie is inspired by a real person Subir Banerjee, who played Apu in Satyajit Ray\u2019s groundbreaking movie Pather Panchali. The story starts with a young film student Arka, knocking on a door of alleged Subir Banerjee, the once iconic child actor turned a grumpy old man. Although he denies the fact that he had anything to do with Pather Panchali. It took a little time and persuasion from the part of Arka to finally make this man own up his true identity. What makes the movie stand out to me is the vivid depiction of the aftermath of a death and loss of loved ones.  Kony (Bengali: \u0995\u09cb\u09a8\u09bf) by Saroj Dey is a national award-winning Bengali movie released in 1984, starring Soumitra Chatterjee and Sriparna Banerjee. This film serves an adaptation of a Bengali novel by the same name written by Moti Nandi. Khidda (Soumitra Chatterjee) is a swimming coach who teaches swimming to underprivileged kids. He picks Kony (the character played by Sriparna Banerjee) from a slum of Calcutta and grooms her to be part of the Bengal Swimming team to compete at the National Swimming Championship. However, she overcomes politics, poverty and social stigma emerge as the National Champion. The rant of Khidda during the climax, \u201cFight, Kony, Fight!\u201d remains one of the most iconic dialogues in Bengali Cinema till date, probably second only to the anguished-filled cry of \u201cAmi je bachte cheyechilam, Dada!\u201d from the movie Meghe Dhaka Tara.
