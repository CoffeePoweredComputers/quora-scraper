            "answer_text": "On the few occasions that I have been to a wealthy person\u2019s home, I\u2019ve noticed how their bookshelves are filled with expensive museum gift shop titles and autographed garbage from so-called new age thinkers. You can expect to find at least one Ayn Rand title, either \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d or \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u2019 which both are completely meaningless. A wealthy person\u2019s foray into poetry begins and ends with The Complete Works of e.e. cummings, an impulse purchase inspired by the film \u201cHannah and Her Sisters.\u201d You\u2019ll also find human lighthouses Malcolm Gladwell and Tony Robbins, which were more than likely gifts from their rich friends who also can\u2019t be bothered to read. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll find at least one book by America\u2019s favorite essayist David Sedaris. His work features charming anecdotes on what it\u2019s like to be in a family where everybody is insane in such a cute and charming way. You\u2019ll find unopened coffee table books on art that retail for $378 each. Photography is a favorite, as it involves less reading. There\u2019s usually one book on the homeless with a cover that features a child sleeping on a street underneath the neon haze of a Coca-Cola sign. Other favorites include wildlife photography books that most of us can\u2019t afford. For example, a photo journal of that features naked models standing next to dead exotic animals in an attempt to raise awareness on the evils of trophy hunting. For the wealthy person who lives on the edge, you\u2019ll find a Robert Mapplethorpe book or two, and an autographed edition of \u201cU2 Unveiled,\u201d that was purchased at the London Apple store for $2,800. I will admit that I once attended a party hosted by a wealthy couple and they had an excellent library. That was over 20 years ago, and we\u2019ve been friends ever since.  I\u2019ve noticed many members of the upper-class surround themselves with charismatic and attractive people. The rich person pretends these people would associate with them if they weren't wealthy, but everyone knows better. As I recall, upper-class college students have a disregard for basic laws and campus regulations. I had a friend who was arrested four times for drunk driving within a three-year period. His name was Randall. His father was a Texas oilman and friends with state senators, representatives, and governors, both past and present. When Randall would get arrested, he rarely spent more than a day in jail. He made one attempt to sober up after his parents sent him to a rehab facility in Hawaii that cost $80,000. After each time he spent a night in a drunk tank, upon his release, his rich friends would throw a party for him as if he\u2019d finished serving a five-year prison sentence. It wouldn\u2019t be fair if I didn\u2019t mention that when we hung out we had a good time. He originally hired me to write one of his English papers for a class that he had failed the previous semester. He could hardly write a sentence, which didn\u2019t bother him. In an effort to motivate his son academically, Randall\u2019s father promised that he would give him $75,000 if he graduated before his 23rd birthday. Randall was going to use that money to open a bar where he and his friends could \u201cget fucked up everyday.\u201d I belonged to a group of student tutors who worked off-campus and were available to complete bigger academic projects that wealthy students couldn\u2019t do by themselves. Fraternities, athletes, and foreign exchange students were our best clients because they couldn\u2019t write and they had money. I had long hair. Randall was a Republican and a member of a fraternity. He would often call me his \u201cfreak friend.\u201d When he introduced me to other people, which included beautiful women who were well out of my league, he would say, \u201cThis is my freak friend, Lance. Ya\u2019ll be nice to him.\u201d Randall received an A for the paper I wrote for him. It was about Telemachus in Homer\u2019s \u201cOdyssey\u201d and how he suffered from an identity crisis due to his absent father. That night, Randall insisted that we celebrate at a steakhouse. He told his friends that I was the go-to \u201cfreak\u201d if they ever needed something written for their English classes. Looking back on this, I realize how unethical it was, but I needed the money and I didn\u2019t want to work at a restaurant or sell marijuana. I lost touch with Randall after he graduated. Seven years had passed when I ran into him at Reunion Arena during a Dallas Mavericks game. He was married to a wealthy and gorgeous woman who was also a devout Baptist. She was standing next to him, but in a non-verbal way made it clear that she was not interested in meeting me. She knew instinctively that I was a loser. Randall and I talked briefly and then he said he had to go. Randall\u2019s wife seemed like the kind of woman who would have blown his head off had he returned to his old ways. That\u2019s the way some women are, and there are men who need a partner like that if they want to lead a healthy life. The last I heard, Randall is the proud father of three children and has been sober for over 25 years.  Have you ever had a colleague that was upper-class? You probably noticed their demeanor didn\u2019t change on paydays. For them, it\u2019s just another day at the office. Middle-class employees are usually in better spirits once their payroll check is deposited. Upper class employees dress better. Their wardrobe consists of high-end brands they couldn\u2019t afford if they had to live solely off of their salaries. They wear watches that are just as expensive as the ones worn by the senior-level executives. They drive luxury cars, go on real vacations, and eat at nice restaurants. And more importantly, they don\u2019t worry how they would survive if they were fired. ",

            "answer_text": "I've read through a large number of answers and thought I'd like to add some things. People are answering to the definition of upper class that they're most familiar with. So I thought it prudent to make a few distinctions first on what what different people could refer to upper class. Doctors, lawyers, bankers, and other well compensated professionals can come from a long line of well compensated professionals. In it you understand the value of money, the value of an education, as well as the value of hard work. They're usually well dressed, own quality products, and live in upscale neighborhoods where cleanliness, homelessness, and safety aren't an issue. A significant portion of their time is dedicated to their profession. They are easily identified by their profession. CEOs, your next door millionaire, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, many of them come from upper middle class families. They had access to a good education, and through their family or school they have a good network that they could leverage for their gain. They're pretty much like the professional class, with more money and usually have to commit more time for their professions. They are easily identified by their professional titles and/or the business they own. Celebrities, singers, athletes, actors\u2026 They made their money from their fame. Their bigger than life lifestyles usually reflect that. And a sizable portion of them end up spending a large portion of their wealth not realizing that their earning potential is entirely dependent on the fickleness of public interest in them, and that's how they end up being broke trying to make any income off the celebrity capital they once had. They're usually identifiable because of their celebrity status, and would often go out of their way to attract attention when there's a need for it. The billionaires who just made it in the past few decades\u2026 in this case I'm referring to the many who earned their wealth in the same way that one would have won a lottery. Proving and showcasing their wealth is an important part of that world. They would otherwise lose social status and would not be taken seriously by their peers. They might not even be considered a viable business partner because if they don't showcase their wealth it won't reflect the success that someone of that status ought to have. As a result you see the purchases of huge yachts and French ch\u00e2teaus, and other obvious signs of wealth. When these billionaires try to integrate with \u201cpolite\u201d society, they're often initially shunned because of their ostentatious displays of wealth and lack of appreciation for subtlety. They then learn that being a philanthropist, a patron, is the way that you become accepted. And once they throw fortunes at the arts and charities, everyone in that world from politicians to old money socialites, who don't have as much money, sell you the legitimacy and honor of being part of their social circles. They're usually identifiable from the Forbes billionaire list, and owners of the most expensive\u2026 (yacht, watch, plane), and they're often in need of a security detail. Finally, we come to the aristocracy. Where a class system was formalized this would be in the form of a nobility, titles and all the associated regalia. Otherwise, it is simply referred to as old money. In which case, the biggest distinction between this group and the rest is their history. These are families who have family members mentioned in history books. Their estates are often historical, and have been passed through multiple generations. They have precious family heirlooms passed on in the family. They often have family traditions that include a particular way of speaking, schools and universities they're more likely to frequent, the names they are most likely to use, hobbies and interests, and established social circles they marry into. This group is usually less wealthy that some of the other groups, and maintaining their history comes at a cost, as such their assets might be worth a good sum of money but they don't have significant spending ability at the level where they can afford sizable yachts. But wealthier people try to get into their circles, and will gladly lend them their yachts, cars, and private planes. You usually know them by their family names, sometimes by their first names even. Any of the above groups could have members where young adults would be seen driving a garishly colored Lamborghini and sporting flashy brands. Though some groups are more likely to do so than others. A Ferrari is a big deal to anyone who thinks that $400k for a brand new car is expensive. But if your social circles aren't going to be impressed by you driving a $400k car because that's too common, what about something like a LaFerrari at about $1.4mln. And that's not all, you'll have to prove that you're worth the right to spend $1.4mln to Ferrari before they'll even sell you that car, owning five other Ferraris is a good start, and competing regularly in the Ferrari Challenge wouldn't hurt. That's how owning a LaFerrari might impress your peers. If your social circles still think that's not such a big deal then a brand new Ferrari isn't going to cut it, you'll have to find something with history. In wealthier circles, $70mln for a Ferrari 250 GTO (one of five that exist) that actually won races and is still in good condition, that's buying a piece of history. What if that's normal in your circles? Then you'll just have to showcase your vintage $70mln Ferrari next to your $150mln Modigliani painting on your $250mln yacht. That's what it takes to compete to impress peers at that level of its about showcasing wealth. Then there are the types of upper class that may apply to any of the above groups who are significantly more discrete. I've had lunch with a nice old gentleman, who is wealthy enough that he and his family had conspiracy theories published about them, and looking back, he actually fits into every one of the groups mentioned above. And after our lunch he got into a taxi to take him back to a very moderate five star hotel. No one who sees him would appreciate just who he is and the influence he and his family have. So there's all types of upper class. If you're looking for what only people in the upper class would be familiar with and it signals that you're one of them, it's not going to be any brands most people are familiar with. You'll be wearing Loro Piana jeans with cashmere lined interiors, a bespoke Saville Row suit made by Gieves & Hawkes, a Voutilainen watch, bench made shoes by A. Testoni or Berluti. Other than the shoes, nothing else will particularly stand out, no one will know that you're wearing nearly $500k worth of clothing and accessories that were made specifically for you. But what you wear only takes you so far. How you speak and what you talk about are even more important. How you annunciate words as well as your choice of words is a strong indication of your social background, the topics you can talk about indicate your education, and how you talk about money indicates your economic status (if you talk about how you spend money, make money, or use money for a good cause, and you're not going to be talking about money obviously but about what you got and what you did and how you spend your time). Another part of upper class is mannerisms. It's the universe of little things from knowing when and how to be diplomatic in your replies and how to be firm and forceful in your tone without being rude, to how to use the right cutlery, to posture, and it keeps going to what a lifetime of little adjustments could shape by the time one becomes an adult. Now let's cut to the chase. If two people from an upper class society meet, how do they communicate that they are part of the upper class. They'll be in the same exclusive events, which is already the first filter, it'll be who they know in common and how they know them, which leads to the other indicators \u201cwe went to the same school/university, our parents are friends\u201d, then what you say and how you say it with the mannerisms and what you wear says the rest of the story. In the upper class you recognize that people from the upper class come from the same environment you do but come in lots of variations, so you know enough not to dismiss someone who might be a librarian or as a guitar player in a Starbucks because they could be dressed in reasonably priced Brooks Brothers khakis and are upper class, and you'll know to watch out for someone dressed in an overpriced Giorgio Armani suit and donning a Rolex who can be a complete pretender. If you're wondering about the difference in mentality its this: you don't live life as if you'll die tomorrow instead you live it as if you'll live forever and this applies to health, wealth, friends, and family; the importance of passive income, the power of compounding, and that wealth is intergenerational; you recognize that your development doesn't end with the end of formal education, and that your hobbies contribute to your development and cultivation; you understand the importance of sustainability, that the sustainability of your status depends on the health and prosperity of your environment (ecological, social, economic, political) and you honestly believe that it is your responsibility to help and that you can make a difference. If you're wondering how to get into those circles, it is really simple. Why should I want to spend my limited time with you? Do you bring entertainment that I'd appreciate, access to events, products, and services I don't have on my own, do you make good company, and most importantly, are you deserving of my trust? Upper class people tend to stick together because people of less privilege often try to take advantage of them. But they're not above having friends with any socioeconomic class, they're just cautious about it. ",
