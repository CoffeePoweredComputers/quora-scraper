            "answer_text": "The only way to learn is to memorize them one at a time and practice until you develop the hand memory to go to the chord you want when you want. Start with one chord: C major, which uses one finger on one string.  Practice playing that chord smoothly and steadily. 1\u20132\u20133\u20134-1\u20132\u20133\u20134 and so on. Then pick a simple song you love that has a second chord. Maybe that chord is F:  Practice that chord 1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20131\u20132\u20133\u20134, and then practice switching between C and F smoothly: C 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 F 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 C 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 F 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 and so on. Then add a third chord, like G:  Repeat playing one bar of each chord and switching between them smoothly C-C-F-F-G-F-C-G ( repeat and experiment with different pattern combinations). Now that you have three chords under your belt, you can play thousands of folk, rock, blues, and pop songs. Join a ukulele club in your area. These often meet 1\u20132x per month and share songs from a group songbook. Often, there is no cost to attend club meetings; events in a restaurant or coffeeshop might suggest that you buy something before the group starts to play. That way you\u2019ll be exposed to dozens or hundreds of simple songs in a supportive environment. Many club leaders will teach the chords and picking or strum patterns to play the songs. For a while, almost every new song you pick up will lead to a new chord or new way to play a familiar chord. And after playing the chord a few hundred times, you will add the muscle memory for dozens of chords and be able to switch to and from any of these chords in a song. After a few months, you will have built a memory bank with 10\u201340 different chords that you will come back to over and over, and you\u2019ll be comfortable playing thousands of songs. Eventually, you will discover a weird new chord that isn\u2019t in your muscle memory, perhaps Ab sus4:  Sometimes, you can use music theory to figure out what notes are in the chord and figure out a fingering pattern that works. You can also refer to the song\u2019s chord chart or a master chord sheet that lists 8\u201310 different chords x each of the 12 different root notes like this one below.  Source: Ukelele Chord Chart - TrueFire Figure out how to play the new chord, how to transition from the previous chord to the new chord, and then transition to the next chord in the song. And keep practicing how to be smooth. ",

            "answer_text": "It is very fun and mostly easy to play ukulele chords. Let\u2019s take a look at some easy chord changes!  Before we delve to deeply into our ukulele chords let\u2019s take a look at the tuning of your ukulele. The resulting names of the chords we play depends on how we tune the ukulele. In this ukulele lesson I assume that you play a soprano ukulele and that you have tuned it in C. What does C-tuning mean? Let\u2019s take a look at the piano keyboard to find out how to tune the ukulele. C-tuning means that the third string on you ukulele is tuned to a C. If you use a piano when you tune your ukulele you will find these notes in the octave in the middle of the keyboard. The notes in this most commonly used octave on the piano are called C4-B4. The number 4 indicate that the notes are on the fourth octave on an ordinary piano. The first string on your ukulele will be tuned to an A4 as we call it. The next string will sound like the piano key E4. The third string will be the note C4. The fourth string will be the note G4. Our first chord is C major. Let\u2019s take a look at it: C: 0/4 0/3 0/2 3/1 What type of notation is this? This is a type of ukulele tab notation where we use numbers to indicate which fret to press down and on which string. 3/1 for example means: Press down fret 3 on string 1. We will now proceed with the chord G major: G: 0/4 2/3 3/2 2/1 As you can see this chord is the same chord as a D major on a guitar. A little bit confusing if you also play guitar but I guess you will get used to it. The chord F major looks like this on your ukulele: F: 2/4 0/3 1/2 0/1 Now we have three chords at our disposal and we can create our first ukulele chord progression: C / / / G / / / F / / / G / / / What does the slashes mean? The most basic way to interpret this notation is: Strum once on a chord name. Continue strumming on the same chord once for every slash! Let\u2019s add one more chord to make this progression a little bit more interesting. Here is G7: G7: 0/4 2/3 1/2 2/1 Here is the progression: C / / / G7 / / / F / / / G7 / / / Before we end this ukulele lesson we will add just one more chord. Here is D minor: Dm: 2/4 2/3 1/2 0/1 Here is the ukulele chord progression: C / / / G7 / / / Dm / / / G7 / / / To really learn to play chords on your ukulele it is important to play them together. The most difficult part is to change from one chord to another smoothly without slowing down the tempo.  Try practicing playing two chords at a time. The actual training consists of changing between the chords. This is a great way to rapidly learn to play the chords of any ukulele song! ",
