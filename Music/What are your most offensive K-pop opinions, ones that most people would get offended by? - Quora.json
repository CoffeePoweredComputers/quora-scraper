The song was ass, sorry.Their is not one good rapper in LOONAThe Sub-Unit songs aren\u2019t as good as the songs from the entire group as a whole.NCT 127 Mark is a way better rapper than TaeyongTheir title tracks aren\u2019t as good as their b-sidesI don\u2019t understand the hype around Simon Says and Limitless because they aren't bad songs but they definitely aren\u2019t all that either.Jungwoo is cringy as hellSuperhuman deserved more hypeI feel like people only like Whiplash because it\u2019s a dirty song. The song is pretty basic in my opinionLove Song is their best b-sideI don\u2019t even know why Yuta is in the group he doesn't add anything special to the group kinda like winwin. I\u2019M KIDDING!!!!  ",
