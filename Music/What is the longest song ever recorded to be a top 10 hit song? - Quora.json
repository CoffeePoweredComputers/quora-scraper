            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re referring to pop or rock recordings, since pretty much any classical piece making the classical hit charts would exceed the following. Someone\u2019s bound to claim \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\", but it never got above #68 on the charts, and that version was only about 3 minutes. The 17\u201319 minute versions were strictly album and live performances. The longest pop song to reach Top 10 in my youth was \u201cMacArthur Park\u201d by Richard Harris, at 7:21 minutes. It made its way onto the Hot 100 at number 79 on May 11, 1968, peaking at number 2 on June 22, 1968 behind Herb Alpert's \"This Guy's in Love with You\". It peaked at number 10 on Billboard's Easy Listening survey and was number 8 on WABC's overall 1968 chart. It topped the music charts in Europe and Australia and also won the 1969 Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s). \u201cMacArthur Park\u201d was also recorded by Donna Summer. Her 3:59 minute version got Summer\u2019s first #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Her 18 minute album version stayed at number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart for five weeks in 1978. In 2013, the 5:39 minute version went into the Donna Summer remix album Love To Love You Donna, which was released to dance clubs all over America, having a successful peaking at No. 1, giving Summer her first posthumous No. 1 and her twentieth No. 1 overall. Other covers hit the Top 100. It was a very popular song, in varying lengths. ",

            "answer_text": "To this date, the record for the longest song to hold the number one slot in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 list was and still remains Don McLean\u2019s 8 minutes 33 seconds long, enigmatic 1971 hit \u201cAmerican Pie\" (which eventually topped the charts in early 1972). Although \"American Pie\" was the longest song to make #1 and hence topping the charts it was not however, the longest song to break into to the top ten. The smash hit that holds that distinction is Guns N\u2019 Roses with their 1992 power ballad \u201cNovember Rain\u201d\u2026. outweighing \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d by almost a half minute. Featuring guitar solos played over lengthy sweeping orchestral backing arrangements and with all of the trappings that one would expect in an epic power ballad being presented by one of the most popular rock bands of the late 20th century...the final cut impressively weighing in at a hefty 8 minutes and 57 seconds.
