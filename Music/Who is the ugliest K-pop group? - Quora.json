            "answer_text": "1.2NE1  2NE1 were called the the ugliest girlgroup ever formed. Blackpink were called the prettier version of 2ne1, just imagine how disrespectful that is for both 2ne1 and blackpink. Now you might think what is wrong with them. The answer is nothing. The only problem present was terrible eyesight of yg entertainment and the people who bashed them. Now let's see the members individually: SANDARA PARK She is the literal definition of godess. She is the prettiest k pop idol yg entertainment ever had and you can't convince me otherwise. If you think she is ugly please contact the nearest mental hospital.    CL Not only is she gorgeous she is also the rap goddess. She has been breaking Korean stereotypes for quite a while but being the trash yg is they kept her in dungeon. Thankfully she left yg and fans (including me) are looking forward for her solo activities.  MINZY One of the best female dancers k pop ever had. Many people didn't found her pretty but personally I find her beautiful.   BOM First of all let's take a moment to appreciate her honey sweet voice. Now coming on to her visuals. She was pretty predebut as well as when she debuted with 2ne1  But yg told her that she is ugly and forced her to get plastic surgery which ended up ruining her face and now haters call her plastic surgery monster. I am still a fan of her voice and will definitely keep supporting her.  2. Piggy dolls   Piggy dolls were a girlgroup formed with overweight members breaking Korean standards. But they were so severely body shamed that they ended up dieting and losing weight. Here are all of the members individually:    So at the end I will say no one is ugly. Beauty is subjective and if you don't like something at least respect it. There is no need to shout your hate across internet because we certainly don't want to see it.

            "answer_text": "DO NOT COMMENT BEFORE READING THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ANSWER. \u2014 Here\u2019s the thing: Rather than saying \u201ceveryone is beautiful\u201d I feel like we need to say, \"\u2115\ud835\udd46\ud835\udd4b \ud835\udd56\ud835\udd67\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd64 \ud835\udd53\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd57\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd5d, \ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd55 \ud835\udd65\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd65\u2019\ud835\udd64 \ud835\udd60\ud835\udd5c\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd6a.\" Because let\u2019s be real. There are people who are good looking. And they are people who aren\u2019t anywhere near good looking. It\u2019s reality. But does it matter? No. What matters is the inside. And yes, \ud835\udc52\ud835\udccb\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcc7\ud835\udcce\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udcc3\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udcbe\ud835\udcc8 \ud835\udcb7\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcca\ud835\udcc9\ud835\udcbe\ud835\udcbb\ud835\udcca\ud835\udcc1 \ud835\udcbe\ud835\udcc3 \ud835\udcc9\ud835\udcbd\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcbe\ud835\udcc7 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udccc\ud835\udcc3 \ud835\udccc\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcce. Because there are many factors that make up beauty, not just the outside, not just superficial things. Everyone has their own charms and beauty, in their looks, in their skills, in their personality. Yes, there are people who I find to be unattractive or have lower than average visuals. But do I care? Do I hate on them or call them ugly? Hell no. They\u2019re still great human beings and talented and skilled and hard-working and kind. By teaching that not everyone is super good looking and that\u2019s perfectly fine, there\u2019s less importance placed on how someone looks. Does that make sense? Anyways.        So let\u2019s keep that in mind, and now I\u2019m going to give you a list of idols that I don\u2019t think are that attractive. Not necessarily answer the question as I don\u2019t agree with how it is phrased. Note that, I do not agree with how the question is phrased. I don\u2019t like the word \u201cugly\u201d in itself, it\u2019s repulsive and like saying someone is just not pretty. I would never say \u201cugly\u201d, these are just some idols that I wouldn\u2019t consider to have the best visuals. They\u2019re all still beautiful in their own way and I am not hating on anyone shaming anyone or bringing anyone down. All of them are amazing, talented, hard-working, and strong women with beautiful souls. - 2NE1\u2019s Park Bom  IZ*ONE\u2019s Chaeyeon  ITZY\u2019s Chaeryoung  Momoland\u2019s JooE  . \u2026Just kidding!
