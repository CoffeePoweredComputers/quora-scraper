            "answer_text": "To speak of God as a \u2018concept\u2019 would imply that the author of the lyrics probably does not believe in God as a reality. If we read the whole song we see that Lennon believes in nothing other than himself and Yoko and has no concept of anything or anyone. Although the word \u2018life\u2019 would have made better sense than \u2018pain\u2019, to consider God in so entirely negative a light is strange, even for an atheist. We measure not just the pain of life but also - and surely more so - the joys of existence, whether or not we believe in God. The song displays a very negative and self-regarding attitude. It is perverse to speak of pain alone as one\u2019s life experience. If the writer is searching for truth and seeking to know God personally, there are better ways of addressing the question. We realise, however, that he does not wish to know God or indeed to know anything outside himself (and Yoko, as an after-thought): after all, he has already made up his mind! He believes in himself. He states clearly in his song that he believes in nothing except himself. I doubt he had any \u2018concept\u2019 of anything: \u2018conceit\u2019, more likely. The clause, if analysed, does not actually make much sense: how do we measure our pain, or anything else, by (or against) a concept? Even if Lennon had equated our pain with the pain of Jesus Christ on the cross, the statement would still have been wrong but it would have made a little more sense. As Lennon declares in his song that he believes in nothing, the statement is nonsense, and anyone trying to make sense of it is wasting his/her time! ",

            "answer_text": "What did John Lennon mean in the song \"God\" by the lyric, \"God is a concept by which we measure our pain\"? He meant that God isn\u2019t what people believe God to be: an all loving Father who will wipe away our tears on the other side of the grave. God is simply a belief (concept) that there\u2019s an all loving father who will wipe away our tears on the other side of the grave & the more we feel pain the more we invest in the idea that there\u2019s a God who will make it all better. This is clearly an accurate observation because we see this is the case in the most destitute countries of the world where there\u2019s no affordable health care or social services & they tend to turn to religions in desparation as there\u2019s no where else to turn which is the point that Karl Marx made when he said: \u201cReligious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.\u201c ",
