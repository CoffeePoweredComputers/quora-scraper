            "answer_text": "You can get a ticket to their concert or go to a fansign event or fan meeting. However these are all SO DIFFICULT.. :( Their concert tickets sell out in seconds and fansign/fan meetings are like winning a lottery like the person above said. In order to have a chance at going to a fan sign event, in which you can talk to each of the members individually and shake their hands and ask them questions 1 to 1(goals). However this is how.. you first have to be an official member of the BTS korean fan cafe, in which you have to verify that you are a fan by posting a an album picture, your melon streaming list and that you have streamed BTS(Korean spotify premium) and many other things as well as pass a test about BTS.Then on the fan cafe, BTS members as well as BigHit post info about fan meetings and official BTS schedules and members will sometime answer questions, for example, Jungkook talked about his acne after it became a huge deal after the 97 line perfomed at one of the music awards. ( he said that it was because he ate so much junk food and that fans don\u2019t need to worry about it; many korean armies thought that he got makeup poisoning or something)When Bighit updates about fan sign event, you have to buy BTS albums (around $50 for 1 album) and a certain number of albums will be chose by random for the sign event. Many Korean armies say that although it is luck, if you want to have a relatively good chance, you have to buy around 200 albums. However, some people got selected while only buying 1 album so it is luck as well.I am a Korean army living in the US and although I go out to Korea pretty frequently I am not even going to attempt at going to a fan sign event because I am extremely BROKE. But good luck!!!!!! I think if you try hard enough (aka have enough money- about $2500 to spend on those albums to have a good chance) then you might be able to see BTS individually. ",

            "answer_text": "You can do the following: Meet them in a hi touch event/fan signing - Joining these events are tricky and not to mention, costly. BTS had this events on only Asian countries so far (as far as I remember). In order to attend a fan signing event, you need to buy albums and your name will be entered in a lottery (the more albums you purchase, the more chances of being picked). Some fans buy insane number of albums just to get that one spot so its pretty much competitive. These events offer closer interaction with the members. You get to touch and talk to them. You can also bring gifts and give it directly to them. They will also sign your album.Attend a concert - Buying BTS concert tickets are notoriously hard and competitive too. Tickets sold out literally in minutes so you must be very, very active and must be on the look out once they announce a tour stop on your preferred location. Sure, there may be resellers but we call them scalpers because they resell the tickets at very high mark ups. In a concert, you will get to see them for a longer time than on fan meets but if you are not literally on the barricade on the pit, they will be pretty far. But, you can always enjoy their performances and dance and sing to your heart\u2019s content. Also, you need to be prepared mentally and physically since concerts can be demanding. Prepare to lose some of your hair when in the standing area (the pit).Attend a fan meet concert (e. g. Happily Ever After) - Same with concert, tickets are pretty hard to come by. Fan meets usually just happen in SoKor and Japan. Shorter duration than concerts. Members tend to be goofier and there might be games.Happen to be in one of their Bon Voyage destinations - If you were in Malta the same time they where there, you might see them but you will most likely be turned down if you will request for a picture (important business). But if you are a bar owner, live in/near their hotel, waiter/waitress, fellow drunkard :), you can expect some members, or at least Jin, to talk to you in broken English.Attend music shows - Same with concerts but shorter time in seeing them (usually just for 1 to 2 songs). More competition on the tickets since all other fandoms will be there too.Be at the right place at the right time - Walking around BH building when they are their, drinking at the same pub with them, etc. This is pure luck and the cheapest (if you did not deliberately traveled). Very fleeting. If you happen to be in this situation, please be a good ARMY and do not bother them. Give them privacy and always be polite. Do not shout and do not chase them. They are human too.Two words: Team Airport - You may want to see them when they jet set around the world. Again, fleeting and you will not be alone. Hundreds or thousands of fans will be with you. Same rules and advice apply here as Number 6.That\u2019s all I can think off the top of my head, as of now. If you are hoping to see them, consider the above options. Good luck and again, be a good ARMY, borahae :) ",
