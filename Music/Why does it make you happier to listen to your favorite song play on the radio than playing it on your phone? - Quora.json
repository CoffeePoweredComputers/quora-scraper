            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Ajita, but I may not be able to support the premise. By \u201con your phone\u201d do you mean the phone speakers? That makes a difference. I love hearing music using headphones with my phone because it envelopes me. Hearing the music on phone speakers is far less satisfying. If by \u201cradio\u201d you mean my car radio or the radio on my awesome home audio system, I much prefer those to the phone because I can feel the sound in my chest.Submit ",

            "answer_text": "Every so often a song is played on the radio, that you knew from 30 odd years ago and forgot the name etc, it is good to hear these songs again, like the stuff John Peel played 1977-1983, and also classic rock tunes on Planet Rock, favourites were: Alex Harvey (SAHB), gang of four, Slits, Curve, Dr Feelgood, Iggy Pop, The Damned, Alone Again or..., Harlem Shuffle, Smoke stack lightning, dust my broom, King Crimson, Roxy music, UFO, Siouxsie, Ruts - all wonderful stuff... A phone is not a proper device for that. ",
