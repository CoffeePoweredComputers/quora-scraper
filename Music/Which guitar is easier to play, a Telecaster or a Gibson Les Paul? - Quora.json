            "answer_text": "Different players will have different answers. There are a wide variety of neck shapes for both models, but typically a Les Paul is a wider at the nut than a telecaster, and a Les Paul also tends to have a thicker neck in depth. There is also the neck profile to consider, Les Paul's usually \"D\" shaped, Tele's are almost always \"C\" shaped because of the narrow nut width. Although there is also the more rare \"V\" shaped neck on Telecasters which some prefer for more articulation within the first 5 Frets. (The V does gradually taper to a C, as you can find Les Pauls with C shape at the nut that taper to D towards the body. Radius of the fretboard will also impact your choice in comfort. Lespaul's are closer to 10 radius while Tele's have 7.5\u2013typically 9.5 radius. Basically Les Paul's will be have flatter fretboards compared to the Tele's radius. Also, having an instrument set up properly by a guitar technician can help match your playing style as well, some preferring lower action and lighter gauge strings for a light tough. In short, there is no absolute answer, the only way to answer this yourself is to go to the closest guitar store and start playing a few of each. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming both are well set up, each is fine to play. The big differences: (a) weight; Les Pauls weigh more than Teles. A factor to consider, especially if you'll be playing all night. Even with a nice wide strap, by the end of the evening my Les Paul can wear me out. (b) scale length: the Les Paul's scale length is 24.75\", shorter than the Tele's 25.5\". I shift readily between them, but some people prefer one over the other.(c) neck shape: the Tele's neck tends to be thinner than the Les Paul's. Again, not a biggie, and I can shift between the two just fine. But some people prefer one over the other.(d) body ergonomics: the Tele is a slab of wood. The Les Paul's top is contoured. Again, I can readily shift between them, but you may prefer one over the other.(e) tone. This is not a matter of playability so much as it is a matter of taste for sonic differences. A Les Paul has two humbuckers; a Tele has two single coils. Again, YMMV.Personally, I like the Tele sound more than I like the Les Paul sound, so I play my Tele much more than I play my Les Paul. ",
