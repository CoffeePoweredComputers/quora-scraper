I have a Spotify playlist called Joy and here are some songs on it that remind me of Hot in Herre: Get it Poppin' by Fat Joe (feat. Nelly)Wat Da Hook Gon Be by Murphy Lee (feat. Jermaine Dupri)Party People by Nelly (feat. Fergie)Mo Money Mo Problems by Biggie SmallsHow We Do by The Game (feat. 50 Cent)Get Like Me by David BannerLow by Flo Rida (feat.
