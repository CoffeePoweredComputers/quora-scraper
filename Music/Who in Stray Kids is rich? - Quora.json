            "answer_text": "Most of them came from a well-off family, as far as I know. Chan- I believe Chan\u2019s family is well-off. From one of the episodes of Finding Stray Kids, when they came to Australia, all 9 of them visited Chan\u2019s house and we really could see that they are well-off, somehow.Woojin- based on him, they often travel as a family. They have gone to some parts of Europe, and the Philippines, and maybe some parts of Asia (I forgot, I only take note of Europe and the Philippines, so far). So from that, we could say, they have the money. And he graduated in SOPA (SOPA is expensive).Jeongin- if he doesn\u2019t pass the audition, he has a plan of studying in Japan, so that explains it.Hyunjin- attended nursery in Las Vegas (I\u2019ve got there the assumption, lol)Changbin- this one I know for sure that is rich, their house has a chandelier. LolSeungmin- gone to LA when he was a kid (assumptions, again).Jisung- correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but Jisung\u2019s parents have a business.Minho and Felix- I\u2019m unsure for this two.Correct me if I\u2019m wrong people. I need more researching. Lol ",

            "answer_text": "I think they\u2019re well off or rich by Korean standard not US standards where here in NYC rich means owning a house or apartment which would cost you a few millions. But they are well off and comfortable living as I\u2019ve seen from some members like Chan. Upper middle class you know. What it would be called here in the US where you make more than $80k-$160k USD per year. Or more depending on your state. I\u2019ve always felt the luxurious one was Seungmin cuz didn\u2019t a Helicopter crash into his Gangnam apartment lol that sounds rich and luxurious to me a high rise in Gangnam like wow! Lol but the members income will only grow over the years being that they write and produce their own songs and things so they\u2019ll get royalties and stuff which will keep the coins rolling into their pockets as time goes on. Smart, smart boys :) ",
