            "answer_text": "You can start making songs at your home in your PC. If you have a laptop then I suppose you can make your songs wherever you want. All you need to make your own music is a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). It is practically a software that allows you to record multiple audio tracks and then mix them into a song. The DAWs provide literally all the tools needed to create your own music. If you are on a Mac OS you can get for free Garageband which is very good to start with and it is actually quite simplified. There are also free DAWs for Windows as well such as LMMS or web based ones such as Soundtrap - Make music online. You gonna need to invest enough time in tutorials on YouTube until you get the desired results. Good luck! ",
