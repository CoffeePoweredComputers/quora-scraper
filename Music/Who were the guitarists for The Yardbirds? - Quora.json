            "answer_text": "The band has had some famous guitarists. Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck were part of the band early in their careers. Other guitarists over the years have included Anthony \"Top\" Topham, Chris Dreja, Gypie Mayo, Jerry Donahue, Ben King, Andy Mitchell, and Earl Slick (very briefly). More recently the talented Johnny A.took over the guitar role. And Johnny was replaced by Godfrey Townsend when he stepped away from the band role. There were several featured famous guest guitarists on their album Birdland. These players were not officially part of the band, but rather had studio player roles. All the Best! ",

Given that Clapton, Beck and Page all played in the band it is not hard to mount an argument that it is the greatest guitar band of all time. ",
