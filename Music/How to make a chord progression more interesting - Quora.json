            "answer_text": "Once you have a chord progression you are happy with, there are many ways you can take it and transform it into something which sounds way more interesting. Some require a lot of experience and some are relatively simple to implement. I\u2019ve put a video together which goes in depth into 3 different techniques you can apply to make your chord progressions sound more interesting and epic. I show you these 3 different techniques in detail but also how they link together and build upon each other. After all, music is a living and breathing thing and can\u2019t be boiled down to a few simple techniques, but techniques do get us in the door. So these 3 techniques\u2026 The Magic of InversionsSounds simple? I show you how you can take the relatively simple concept of chord inversions and completely transform the sound of the chord progression. It can even introduce a subtle melody if you do it right. So, first you can experiment by starting with your first chord and then on each subsequent chord change, move up towards the high end of the piano by changing your chord inversions. How does this sound? Do you like it? Is it forced? Do you like maybe the sound of just two changes? Reverse this process and move down towards the low end of the piano. Put them together and maybe you have a completely different perspective on your chord progression. Digging for MelodyHow can we introduce melody into our chord progression. Adding in a melody can completely change the sound, add dissonance and generally make the chord progression sound more interesting. We can create very nice sounding melodies we can either play ourselves on the piano by weaving it into our playing\u2026 or\u2026 maybe its a great melody which can be used with a vocal line. Either way, adding in a melody is the next step and is such an important part of elevating the sound of your chord progression. But how can we do this\u2026 So the easiest way to start is by taking the the top notes of your chords and using them as anchor points. Now you have various start and end points. We can then work out how we can move between these notes. Do we use passing notes? Do we go below the end note and back up? What rhythm do we use? Do you want to start on perhaps the middle note instead of the top note? The possibilities are endless and its up to you to experiement. Now whilst this technique is great for feeling around and getting familiar with melody creation, remember, its a simple technique to get you familiar with the process. The creativity will come once familiarity is established. This as I said before is a direct, simple route in and will open you up to further experimentation. One last thing to note is in the video below, I show you how you can use this technique to arrive at the same melody as Adele\u2019s verse melody in \u2018Hello\u2019. Now you wouldn\u2019t say Adele couldn\u2019t right a melody right? So lastly\u2026 Creating Tension and ReleaseThis is a great technique to take you and/or the listener on a journey. Good music is made up of tension points where you are made to feel uneasy and then release points where this feeling is resolved. If you can make somebody feel, then you\u2019re doing your job as a music creator. To get started with this and to transform your chords from ordinary triads into more interesting chords such as 7th, sus etc. Try this\u2026 In your right hand, play a power chord in the root position of your key. The power chord being the root and the 5th note. So if we\u2019re in the key of C, this would be a C and a G. Then in your left hand, play your normal chords. Every time you change chords in the left hand, keep the same power chord in the right. This interplay between the notes in the right and the left will introduce variations to your chords. I\u2019ve put the below video together to show you how these techniques work separately, but also how they work together and build on each other to end up with something which sounds different from where you started.  If you want to see and hear the above examples of how to make your chord progressions sound more interesting, then check out the video. Techniques breed familiarity and through familiarity, creativity can flow. I hope you enjoy it and get something out of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a couple of suggestions. Put a different chord under the melody, one that does not normally belong in that key. Example: if you are in C and the melody has a G, and the obvious chord is G, change to G minor. Or if the obvious chord is C under that G note, use Eb.Make transitions more interesting by inserting dominant chords. For instance, going from C to Am, insert an E7. If you go from C to D, insert A7.Alex Strekal's answer to How can I make a chord progression more interesting? has a special case of this: if you go one scale step down, for instance from Em to Dm, you can use a chromatic passing chord Eb instead of A. You can also consider this as a variant of the next option:If you want to get really wild, explore tritone substitutions: replace a C7 by F#7. Those two chords share the E and the Bb/A#, so if your melody has a C, you need an F#7-5, and if the melody is on a G this doesn't really work.",
