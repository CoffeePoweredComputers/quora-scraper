            "answer_text": "There are literally hundreds of music genres, just as there are languages. Each genre has its variations and sub-genres, the same way a language has dialects. Both are cultural constructs that allow us to communicate ideas, feelings and emotions. The reason I made this comparison is to better illustrate the difficulty in answering such a question. A new genre can only occur when there is a radical change in musical tools and technology. In general terms most of the music genres that have come about in the past century can still be considered to be very new. If you wanted to discover new music, the best place to look is still in the recent past rather than the present\u2026 Furthermore, most of the music industry is promoting the same few genres for a very specific reason. Music has to be immediately recognizable in order for people to be able to relate to it. This is why any new genre will only be known to a specific sub-culture and it would not be heard by the general public, perhaps forever. TL;DR \u2018New\u2019 music doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be \u2018recent\u2019 music, take a look back and have a listen to something you didn\u2019t pay much attention to before. You\u2019ll be surprised. If you want to explore this vast area of knowledge I highly recommend this website: Every Noise at Once ",

            "answer_text": "Whatever the latest genre of music is, we likely haven\u2019t heard it yet. When it starts getting attention, music marketers will find a way to make it accessible for pop music fans. It happened with punk, metal, grunge, rap, etc. If the music can be combined with pop, the genre will stick around. Otherwise it goes underground or dies out. ",
