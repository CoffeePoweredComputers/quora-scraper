            "answer_text": "What is the best song you have ever heard? My answer will defy the other answers, since I\u2019m a professional musician. Since age 12, I am not actually able to just sit down and listen to a song. Instead, since I know the \u201clanguage\u201d of music, from the start of a song, my brain analyzes it theoretically. This is like listening to someone swear in Greek softly and sweetly. If you don\u2019t know Greek, it sounds nice. If you do know Greek, it doesn\u2019t. Because of that, it\u2019s very difficult for me to narrow any category (i.e. favorite band, favorite musician, favorite song) to just one example. There are plenty of well written songs out there, with well written lyrics too. Thus, the more theoretically complex a song is, the more I appreciate it, but the song has to make musical sense and not be atonal or serial. Serialism - Wikipedia As far as composition goes though, I feel one of the best composers is Rachmaninoff. Many say his third piano concerto (although very similar to the second) is the height of 20th century composition.  (Rachmaninoff playing Piano Concerto #3) When I listen to this, there\u2019s so much more to it than other 20th century styles of music. This has more counterpoint and role changing (i.e. piano plays theme, then orchestra plays theme while piano plays what the orchestra played during the first bars). The best part is we have a recording of the composer himself playing it as he intended it to be played. I\u2019ve heard this piece played by many gold medal pianists often, but none capture its soul as much as its original creator. Typically when I listen to a pop song, for example, \u201cHey Jude\u201d, I\u2019m listening to the chord progression and melody, which are typically repetitive in popular music. This leads essentially to musical boredom for me, although I have nothing against pop music. Since this question has been merged with a question about motivational songs, I can tell you during my high school years I tried to emulate his writing style as well as I could. Listening to his music made me write a bunch of \u201cclassical\u201d pieces for piano and other instruments. Another favorite composer of mine is Antonio Carlos Jobim, who\u2019s work inspired my second album, Jobimesque. Although not as obviously complex, Jobim was subtle. His chord progressions and simple melodies are incredibly pleasing to the ear. At the time, there was more improvisation in (pop) music as well, which brakes away from modern pop music where we hear the same form continuously.  (Jazz Samba is now called Bossa Nova.) On the other end of the spectrum, you have people like Bob Dylan who are more poetic than musical. His voice, in my musical opinion, is terrible, but the lyrics are wonderful. For example his song \u201cLike A Rolling Stone\u201d has a very limited musical form. (Verse, Pre chorus, Chorus)  What\u2019s better, to me, is when other artists cover his songs, for example the first version of this song to come out commercially was Jimi Hendrix cover.  It\u2019s a lot more musically complex than the style of Dylan himself in its arrangement. Not to mention, Jimi can actually sing well. So, to me, the criteria for \u201cthe best song I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d is incredibly complex, and as you can see, I have no answer to it :P ",
