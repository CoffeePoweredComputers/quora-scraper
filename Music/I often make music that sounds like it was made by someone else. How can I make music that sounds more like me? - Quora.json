            "answer_text": "From the comment: \u2018I just want to do stuff that sounds unique enough\u2019 I know you do. But, trust me: you don\u2019t want to do this. What do you mean, Alex? Of course I want to sound unique! Yeah, but you know what? That\u2019s not your musical self talking. That\u2019s your pride talking. And you need to get it to shut up, so that you can make music that communicates with people. What do you mean? Look: Music is a common language. We, in the West at any rate, all use the same notes and harmonies and rhythms. And licks. And chord progressions. If we use chord progressions at all. We cannot escape this. In order for our music to be welcomed and appreciated by other people, they have to understand our musical language. And so our musical language has to have something familiar about it. Yeah, but everything I do sounds like someone else made it! That\u2019s because you\u2019re still digesting your influences. All you can hear in your own music is the stuff that you\u2019re influenced by. Here\u2019s how you get over that: You lean into it. Supposing Z is one of your favourite musicians, right? Z being here a variable that stands for: whoever. Insert name here. Your music sounds like Z\u2019s music, but you want it to sound like your music, right? What you need to do is consciously try and make something that sounds as much as possible like Z\u2019s music. Dive deep into Z\u2019s music. Get to know how Z\u2019s music works, so that you can not only reproduce it yourself but can make something that sounds like it. The weird thing is that, in doing this, you will start to find yourself. You see, what you\u2019re doing now is trying to shake off Z\u2019s influence, instead of absorb it. If you embrace being completely unoriginal for as long as it takes you to learn to sound like Z, you will come out the other end with a much stronger awareness of how you are not like Z. You will be able to spot the difference between what Z does, and what you want to do. This is an ancient process for musicians: learning to copy other people as a way of developing one\u2019s own originality. Practically all composers back in the day started out as choirboys, singing other people\u2019s music before learning to write their own. Later, they played other people\u2019s music before starting to compose. Jazz musicians learned other people\u2019s solos as a way of internalising how they played, and they took what they needed. Rock bands start out playing other people\u2019s songs, if they\u2019ve got any sense, and then learn to make their own. You have to pay your dues. That means properly learning what it\u2019s like to speak someone else\u2019s musical language, before you can develop one of your own. It works in other creative fields, too. The French writer Marcel Proust, before he dived into composing his great novel cycle In Search of Lost Time, published a small book of parodies of other writers, Pastiches et M\u00e9langes, so as to get their styles out of his system. The paradox is that you can only learn what it\u2019s like to be original by first embracing unoriginality. Having done so, you begin to develop your own language, out of the things you\u2019ve taken from other people\u2019s. Because nobody ever listens to a piece of music that they love and says Wow, that music is so unique! They listen to a piece of music they love and they say Wow, that music is amazing! Think of the music that you love. Think of how you can hear other, previous music in it. That\u2019s because those musicians aren\u2019t afraid of sounding like other people if it enables them to speak as themselves. As long as your main intention is trying to sound unique, you will never, ever achieve it, and you will never make music that other people respond to. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not certain that I have an answer for you, but it is an interesting question as I used to have the opposite problem. I have been recording and producing music for almost 25 years now.  Self taught on every instrument and every step of the process.   My complaint to myself used to be that everything I made didn't sound like it came from the style or genre I was aiming for.  It sounded \"too unique.\"  I never let it get me down...I just tried harder. Well, over two decades later, all said and done, I don't care anymore.  In fact, I revel in the fact that what I make sounds the way it does.   Over time all of my influences got wrapped together.  Intertwined.   I imagine if you continue on your path you'll probably end up somewhere around where I am.  Just keep making your music.  For me, I just kept making my music and the eccentricities in my music were tempered into something decidedly less eccentric.  For you?  Over time you will, unknowingly, expand outward to find your own voice. Just don't be discouraged.  Keep making music. ",
