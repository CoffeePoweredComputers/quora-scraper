            "answer_text": "Let's assume the question was meant seriously. Let's also assume you are relating the increase in tourism based on Posner taking \"the\" pill and not because he got famous despite the pill and his horrible experiences trying to impress Avicii that he was cool. I seriously doubt that there is an immigration/border control survey that includes the question of taking a certain pill as a reason for visiting the island. I could see tourism wants to know why you are visiting Ibiza, but doubt it contains this question. Without a baseline number, and I haven't seen one yet that says:\"Tourism increased by 20% due to the illegal availability of a \"pill\". The video made it look more like an acid trip gone sour, which makes me almost believe that Mr. Posner still might be unaware of what he actually took. Maybe he really took pills, and not just one, but then it would not sound good any longer: I took a bunch of pills in Ibiza, to show Avicii I was insane, when I finally got clear, I ordered another beer, and said, fuck it!Let's do this over again.... Well, actually, this at least rhymes :). To summarize: No way to tell if tourism shot up. Mike Posner is the only one who shot up the charts for sure. And, it's actually a cool song. If in town, I will check out his DJ skills in Scottsdale, AZ soon. He might ask for another pill if he sees this 61 year young person and his wife hopping around the dance floor. LOL. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak to actual tourism statistics in Ibiza, because I don\u2019t think they are published for such recent years yet, but we can look at the level of interest in traveling to Ibiza both prior to and following the release of the song. Since the song was released on 24 July 2015, I searched for \u201cflights to Ibiza\u201d on Google Trends from one year before and after:  There seems to be no direct influence of the song on interest in going to Ibiza when you consider that flights to popular tourist destinations go up during the summer anyway. That peak coincides with the middle of the northern hemisphere\u2019s summer, and as you can see in the same Google Trends search from 2004-present, interest in flights there is quite cyclic:  I also think the song\u2019s release date has nothing to do with the spike immediately following it. Except perhaps when a song\u2019s release is accompanied by a major event like a Superbowl halftime show, internet search popularity tends to lag behind a song\u2019s release by a matter of months. It needs time to make it onto radio playlists and reach more listeners before they start planning their vacations based on the lyrics. Anecdotally, we do know that the song had an effect on tourism officials in Ibiza, in that they were worried the song would influence the public\u2019s perception of the island in a negative way[1]. However, their quotes hint that the world already knew Ibiza to have a thrilling nightlife, so again I doubt that Mike Posner had any real effect on tourism numbers.

I personally feel like I live there already. After hearing to the song back to back. Everytime the lyrics just hit me. ",
