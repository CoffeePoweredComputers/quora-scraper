            "answer_text": "I would suggest a few non-standard answers. Do not be afraid to look at all sorts of genres for backing tracks-rock, electronica, country, big band/swing, other rap songs, R&B, jungle, DnB, so forth. Many early rappers started out with sampling, such as sampling Amen, Brother-the most sampled song in the world. The Amen Break is the most important break in history, six seconds of drum fill that has been sampled, slowed, sped up, cut up-and it inspired multiple genres of music. The most famous song to sample this break is \"Straight Outta Compton\" by NWA. As for rappers to look at, yes Eminem tracks are good to look at as he is a phenomenal and creative genius. For a less known rapper, Sage Francis is a viable alternative, as he is extremely intelligent, using puns and metaphorical speech in his raps. Guns Yo, Best of Times and Slow Down Ghandi may be good ones to look at. For instrumentals, Black Helicopters by Necron may be worth looking up, perhaps even instrumental versions of J-Rock songs, such as J A Seazer/Ceasar, a groundbreaking composer.  ",
