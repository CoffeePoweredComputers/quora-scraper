            "answer_text": "One thing i suggest you do is, task yourself with listening to one music album a day from any genre. You can do this successfully by going on Apple music or spotify or soundcloud. While you are at it, be sure to read the lyrics as well. Make it a sing along if you want. Try out albums you have never listened to. At the end of the day, try writing something. It doesn't have to be a full song. It can be something with two lines. For example; \u201cI am trying to help someone with something that works for me If they do it well enough it\u2019'll show how good they can be\u201d I wrote that now off the top of my head. Do not worry about melody or anything. Just write. Everyday. However, if you have a melody, record immediately. Do not trust that you will remember even if you will. Record it. Pick a favourite song from that album. Think about it. Ask yourself what the message of the song was and why you like it (melody, singer's voice, lyrics etc). Do a research on the song; writing style, reviews and all. If you do this religiously, by the end of the week, you will find out that you have listened to seven albums, analysed seven songs and have written seven pieces that have the potential of becoming songs once you work on them. Another thing you can do is, write your own lyrics to existing melodies. For example; \u201cDon't go Don't leave I'll be back home in a minute so don't blink, don't move an inch\u201d I just wrote that off the top of my head to the melody of Adele\u2019s hit song \u201cHello\u201d. When you do this, you are creating lyrics for yourself that can be placed on original melodies you create in the future. Please let me know if this helps you. ",
