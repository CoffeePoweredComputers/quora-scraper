            "answer_text": "Looking forward to the answers!!! Minor keys have never meant depression or suppressed moods to me. The general composition and how the music feels comes to be identifiable through how the music is handled and what in general the composition wants to be and accomplish, not just by a minor chord or a series of them. What about the melody? What about the harmonies? What about the sequence of chords? What about the rhythm? What\u2019s the general sense and level of liveliness? All the components of a musical piece will be chosen so they match for a final balance of effects, and SO MUCH well beyond the chords chosen have a major role to play in the general impression the music creates. A minor chord (and lots of chords beyond the major chords) can by careful selection open the heart and mind and be very positive, full of WONDER, EXPLORATION, COURAGE and POSITIVE ENERGY if the music (and associated lyrics) mean to be that way. Minor chords and other types of chords break the pattern of the major chord sequencing and can make things seem asymmetrical, growing, changing, insecure, unsteady, multi-dimensional (extremely important), unsettled, not fully understood, have possibilities beyond the limits delivered in the music, and a million other things, where major chords can too often seem settled, finalized, unquestioning, unadventurous, having hard borders, closed of mind and heart, stationary, smug, simple and at worst, superficial (which can undermine what the music is trying to accomplish). Everyone have an Dminor day! ",
