            "answer_text": "Because of the synthwave \u201caesthetic\u201d. There can be different feels/atmospheres/moods/tones/ to synthwave, but one of the most common is this \u201cneon-lit, summery, city-by-the-ocean, cruising-at-nighttime-through-the-city-after-it-just-rained\u201d aesthetic. It just FEELS right for how the songs sound. For example, The Midnight\u2019s newest album cover:  I think the main reason for this is pop culture. The idea of synthwave as a genre is to create a pseudo-1980\u2019s dream place you can travel to while listening. And the way to do this is to pull from the pop culture and concepts common in the 1980s. A lot of classic 80\u2019s films and shows with the synthwave \u201caesthetic\u201d take place in Miami. Specifically, Miami Vice. I believe another influence could very well be games like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City which has that same aesthetic:  There\u2019s also things like Beverly Hills Cop. While not all of this media takes place in Miami, they all have similar elements: a city by the ocean, palm trees, neon lights, boxy cars, sunny beaches\u2026 you get the idea. ",
