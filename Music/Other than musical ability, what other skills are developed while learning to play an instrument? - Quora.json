            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve played cello for four years, and I\u2019ve learned and developed many related and unrelated skills: Mathematical reasoningThis one is probably the most obvious. Music is divided as fractions, and in order to correctly count the beats and where the notes go in relation to the beats, you need a where-developed sense of fractions and numbers in general, so you can glance at a measure and immediately know where the beats go and where your notes go. This is especially challenging to do quickly, since rhythm is hard. Social skillsIf you\u2019re playing in a band, orchestra, or other group, you\u2019ll gain a group of people that you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time around. Spending time around people naturally improves your social skills. Additionally, children learning to play an instrument learn how to talk to adults by the need to effectively communicate with directors and private teachers. Music isn\u2019t something that can be learned without questions. There are subtletys that a committed student will want to know about, and they\u2019ll have to ask. Adults gain a similar advantage but not to the same degree as they already know how to talk to people their own age. Concentration skillsLessons, group rehearsals, and practicing all require large chunks of time focused on just the music. Unlike general classes in school, there isn\u2019t work that can be finished, and then time after to fool around and not focus. When you\u2019re playing your instrument, you cannot be distracted, since you need to learn what is best for you playing your music, as well as fixing any mistakes, which will be there. Dealing with frustrationThere will always be mistakes, and when there aren\u2019t mistakes, there are dynamics, and once dynamics are nailed, there\u2019s style, and after that, phrasing and speed, followed by technique. You\u2019re never done, and you can be working on one two-measure sequence for hours on end, trying to figure out what sounds wrong, only to realize that you were playing a C sharp instead of a C natural in one chord, along with counting a beat wrong. Creative problem solvingA forgotten skill in music: problem solving. When playing a solo piece, you have to figure out what exactly you want to convey to your audience, and work that into your piece in any manner of ways. This is how famous musicians get their distinctive styles. When playing in a group, you may have to make modifications to suit what the others in that group are able to play, or change something to make technique a little easier, such as shifting for string instruments. Coming up with these little changes is a skill that quickly improves with practice. ResponsibilityYour instrument, which is expensive (unless it\u2019s a harmonica), needs you to take care of it. If it\u2019s a string instrument you need to wipe it off with a soft cloth from time to time and you can never forget to loosen your bow hair before putting your bow away. The utmost care is imperative to prevent damaging your instrument. If those reasons aren\u2019t enough for you to get started on learning an instrument, I don\u2019t know what would be. Music is a complex, multifaceted art form, and playing in instument is a fantastic way to learn about it. ",
