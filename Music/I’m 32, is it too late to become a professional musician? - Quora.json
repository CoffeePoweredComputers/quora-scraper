            "answer_text": "Probably. The thing about becoming a professional musician is it takes years and years and years of working away getting no money at all. Literally nothing. You have to get really good, then have a lucky break. Most professional musicians aren\u2019t that brilliant at their instruments they were just in the right place at the right time. Now there\u2019s a lot of skill involved with putting yourself in the right place at the right time, but there\u2019s still a huge amount of luck as well. You just have to plug away on some music scene somewhere, get well known to everyone on the scene as being good, then hope someone who notices you is in a position where they can pay you. It takes a very long time. Most people are going to quit before they have their lucky break. The thing is, if you start doing it at 16, it might take you 10 years before anything happens. That means you\u2019ll be 26 before you start making a proper living from it. Until then you\u2019ll be working in bars or whatever to make ends meet, and fit it all around your music. It\u2019s ok to still be doing that at 26. But if you start at 32 and it takes you until you are 42 to get the break, do you still want to be working in bars and living off tips when you are 42? Really I think you need to give it at least 10 years before you can really say you\u2019ve given it a go. And furthermore, most people will not \u201cmake it\u201d as a professional musician. You might make a bit of money here and there but not enough to live off. It\u2019s a big gamble to take at 32. Trying to find a new career at 42 when it hasn\u2019t worked out sounds like hard work to me. Id rather do something else and keep music as a hobby if I were you. ",

Or should I just spend the rest of my life in misery because I \u2018happen\u2019 to have been born 32 years ago?\u201d The answer\u2019s pretty obvious when you put the question like this, doesn\u2019t it? In all seriousness: You do only really have a short time to live, regardless of how old you happen to be right now. Does the \u201cquantity\u201d of time you\u2019ve lived (or have left to live) really matter most to you? Or is it the quality? ",
