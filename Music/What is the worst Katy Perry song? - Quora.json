Why not \u201cBirthday,\u201d \u201cSwish Swish,\u201d or \u201cRise?\u201d Well, while I may not be a fan of ANY of those songs (\u201cBirthday\u201d is often dubbed the sequel to \u201cLast Friday Night,\u201d but it\u2019s a letdown of a sequel, in my opinion), \u201cBon Appetit\u201d is just the worst. Boring lyrics, not very sexy (I\u2019m fine with songs not being sexy, but considering that \u201cBon Appetit\u201d is supposed to be, I thought I needed to add that), and it has a lame music video. One listen to that song and you\u2019ll automatically know that it was written to appeal to modern day and tried very hard to be \u2018trendy.\u2019 I prefer Katy Perry songs that she wrote because she wanted to and she enjoyed them, not songs that she writes just to have an album so she doesn\u2019t become irrelevant.
