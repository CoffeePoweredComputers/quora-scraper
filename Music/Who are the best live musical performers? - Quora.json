            "answer_text": "We will rank the ten entertainers we consider to be the best of them all. But before that, we would like to state that we will not be adding rock stars. When we think of entertainers, we think of professionals who are able to sing well, dance well, have great showmanship, and engage the audiences and viewers. Without further ado, let us get into it! HONOURABLE MENTIONS We will not rank this group of performers; we will only list them. They include: Shakira, Bruno Mars, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Timberlake, Jason Derulo, Ariana Grande, Mick Jagger\u2026 Without a doubt though, the greatest entertainer in our honourable mentions list is Madonna. She is a legendary artist, but today, we are focusing only on what they do on stage, and she does a lot. MADONNA   The Queen of Pop, everyone!  10. USHER RAYMOND  Usher has quite a huge following, and for good reason. He is a great pop and R&B artist, and an even greater entertainer. Usher is a gifted vocalist with excellent showmanship, great dance moves\u2026and he is also a sex symbol. His stage performances have been complimented by critics as packed with high-octane choreography held together by sleek, masterful showmanship, and his presence engaging enough to pull off a one-man show. He has also been compared to some of the other greats due to his ability to sing and dance at the same time. What\u2019s more \u2014 he is also a proficient instrumentalist. This indicates that he has a variety of ways to engage his audience.  He is one of the very best in our eyes, and tenth place is just right for him. 9. BEYONCE KNOWLES  \u201cQueen Bey\u201d, as she is often called is an excellent entertainer. As of today, she is already an all-time great. The kind of impact she currently has in the music industry has not been seen for a long time. Like Usher, she is amazing whether performing alone or with choreographers, and she is able to sing and dance at the same time. Beyonce is not as great a dancer as Usher, but she is a more accomplished vocalist. In addition, she compares to him in terms of masterful showmanship; it is likely that she is even ahead. Beyonce is fire on stage, utilising her great moves, singing and sex appeal to her advantage. She is already a role model to so many. Like Usher, Beyonce studied from the greats and forged her own unique path. Beyonce already has a couple of performances that will be remembered for a long time. Think of her masterful Coachella and Superbowl performances. No wonder she is compared to some of the greats and feels at ease around them \u2014 even if we think some of the comparisons are far-fetched.   We know for a fact that future female entertainers have a lot to live up to. 8. JANET JACKSON  A part of the incredibly musical Jackson Family, it is not a surprise that Janet is what she is. She is a great singer, as well as one of the best and most energetic dancers ever. To be honest, we do not know of a better female dancer. Her movements are so fluid, so magical and so well coordinated. And while singing too! Also, her stage presence is frightening for one with such a shy persona. Growing up in the Jackson household, Janet had a lot to live up to. The Jackson 5 were the standard of artistry in the family and the world, but Janet has been a superstar and a legend in her own right for a long time. With timeless songs like Control and Rhythm Nation, it is not hard to see why. Then her greatness on stage cannot exactly be described \u2014 merely witnessed.  We will give her that. She is the best female dancer ever\u2026and by a country mile! 7. TINA TURNER  \u201cThe Queen of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll\u201d is the last female you will ever see on this list. Tina\u2019s achievements and versatility are tough to overlook. Even today, she remains the most iconic benchmark (if not the only one) for female performers. She has greatly influenced female artists, including Beyonce and Janet Jackson. Tina is an extremely energetic dancer, and an extraordinary singer, one of the best ever. Her royalty nickname was earned due to her extremely powerful, raspy voice which helped her to even sing rock songs and power ballads. She had a level of showmanship unseen in some great performers. She is a like a combination of a rock star and a pop singer. The level of liveliness in her concert is something to behold. And she was able to sing and dance at the same time. No female entertainer has ever captivated an audience like Tina Turner.  She is a phenomenon, a legend. 6. SAMMY DAVIS JR.  If you want to know where entertainment as we know it originated from, look no further than its pioneer, Sammy George Davis Jr. A singer, an actor, a vaudevillian, a dancer, a musician, a comedian\u2026this man really could do it all. He had to deal with racism as he paved the way for black entertainers after him, but his gifts, hard work, and perseverance could not be suppressed. Today, we will look at his performing. Sammy was a very good singer. His style reflected Frank Sinatra\u2019s style of keeping things simple. The beauty of their singing was in their simplicity. He was also a showman like few others. Then he was an extraordinary tap-dancer, a legendary one, in fact.   We know it is old school, but it is not any less appealing. It was always fun to see Sammy Davis Jr in action. 5. PRINCE  Prince Nelson Rogers \u2014 or \u201cThe Purple One\u201d was a timeless artist. Some of the previous ones are timeless too, but Prince had something more. We could talk about how prolific a songwriter he was, or how great a producer he was, but we will focus on his performing, and how masterful he was at that! Prince was a proficient, self-taught instrumentalist, and he had a special affinity with the guitar. He was a guitar virtuoso. Also, he was a swift, highly skilled dancer with lots of confidence and charm. He was an incredible showman and a highly skilled singer. He could do it all. Oh\u2026and he was a sex symbol.   His Superbowl Purple Rain performance has been voted the greatest Superbowl performance ever, so we had to include it. Prince was a genius, as well as one of the most unique entertainers ever. 4. ELVIS PRESLEY  \u201cThe King of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll\u201d is possibly the greatest artist ever. With many timeless songs and unforgettable concerts, it is no wonder why. Elvis is one of the greatest singers of all time. His voice was rich, velvety, strong and extremely lovely. It was a golden voice. And he used it remarkably. His voice was very versatile, able to cover a wide range of musical genres. He knew his voice well and he had so much control over it. He was also an extremely able dancer \u2014 inventing or popularising some iconic moves. We think he was a complete performer. His stage presence and charisma were legendary in every sense. He could work a crowd like none other. And he did not require a team of dancers. He required back-up singers, but much of the time, he delivered his concerts alone.    We have no words for this man! 3. JACKIE WILSON  \u201cMr Excitement\u201d was a prominent figure in the transition of Rhythm and Blues into Soul. Jackie was a master showman, as well as one of the most dynamic singers and performers in pop, R&B, and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll history. He was one of the singers of the highest calibre, and his dancing was neat, fluid and phenomenal. He could do both simultaneously. Today, his name will be one of the first to be mentioned when the history of entertainment is being discussed. That is how influential he was. He was so gifted that he never needed back-up dancers to entertain people. His singing was so great and so soulful, and his voice could adopt an operatic timbre.   He was one of a kind. 2. JAMES BROWN  \u201cThe Godfather of Soul\u201d can also be described as funk music\u2019s greatest exponent. He is one of the greatest artists ever. James is one of the most sampled artists ever, and he holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart which did not reach #1. But 17 of his singles reached #1 on the Billboard R&B charts. It must be noted that he greatly contributed to music as we know it today. James was a tireless entertainer, a masterful, energetic dancer, a powerful, soulful singer, and he might just be the greatest showman ever. He invented and popularised some very iconic moves. He sang and dance at the same time like it was nothing. He has also influenced several entertainers \u2014 past and present \u2014 who went on to become superstars.   James Brown was simply too good! He remains one of the most complete entertainers ever. 1. MICHAEL JACKSON  \u201cThe King of Pop\u201d is possibly the greatest artist of all time. One of the most famous men ever \u2014 if not the most famous man ever, Michael has influenced the music industry like none other, and he has been awarded more than any other artist in history. We will however consider his performing prowess today. Michael is arguably the greatest singer in history. His voice was incredibly lovely, smooth, strong, and golden. His was a vocal chameleon \u2014 his voice could adopt different timbres. This quality enabled him to cover many musical genres. His vocal style remains the most unique one ever.  Michael was an extraordinary dancer despite having no formal training. He simply studied the greats like James Brown, Jackie Wilson, and Fred Astaire, and performed their moves with his own style. He also invented and popularised the most iconic moves in history. His moves were miraculously smooth and very perfectly coordinated. He was a dance genius \u2014 perhaps the only true one.  His showmanship did not quite match James Brown\u2019s, but it was still ahead of the rest. Michael would sometimes utilise his performance to address social or global issues, a mark of his intelligence and creativity. He remains the greatest and the most complete entertainer of all time.  He remains incomparable.  Do you agree with our ranking? Let us know what you think! Meanwhile, you can check this out: Kenny Singer's answer to Who is the best singer of all time? Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Question: What musical artists put on the best live performance? The answer to this question is very subjective as, what I think is the best live performance, will likely be of a musical artist that I really enjoy and maybe even my favorite band. That being said, not all bands I like put on good shows. Luckily for me, my favorite band puts on an AMAZING show, and they\u2019ve won a LOT of awards for their live performances, so I know it\u2019s not just my opinion alone. Who is my favorite band? MUSE. Something about their music just works for me in a really big way. Although I had heard of them earlier in 2009, I eventually saw a video of them singing Super Massive Black Hole, live in concert and decided I just had to see them live. The first show I could find was at The Joint in Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel. It was an epic show and made me realize that I love, not just going to concerts, but being in a GA Pit feeling like I was a PARTICIPANT in the show instead of sitting in a seat and feeling like an OBSERVER. They are actually on tour right now and I highly recommend going. I\u2019ve seen them three times in the last three months. I found this review that was written about their show at the Oracle Arena in Oakland California on March 9, 2019. Review: Muse might just have delivered the best show of 2019 So, what about those awards? Although they\u2019ve been nominated for over 100 awards and won dozens of them over the last 20 years since they released their first album in 1999, 16 of the awards have been specifically for their performances: 2002, Kerrang!

Keep an eye out on when they\u2019ll be around and show up. You\u2019ll probably find yourself having a fantastic time. (note: When I went looking for the definition of the Q Awards \u201cBest Act in the World Today\u201d I came up short so it\u2019s possible that the award isn\u2019t specifically about their live act, but I decided to go for it anyway) ",
