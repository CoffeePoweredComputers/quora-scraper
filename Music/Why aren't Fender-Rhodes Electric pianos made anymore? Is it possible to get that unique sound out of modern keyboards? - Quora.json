            "answer_text": "They are not manufactured today because the technological progress allowed them to invent/create new instruments, these days everything\u2019s digital, you can find some software synth and get a plug-in and make the exact sound that you want or choose from presets. If you have a good sound card inside your computer, good MIDI keyboard with at least semi-weighted keys, and if you have monitors/monitoring headphones, you will still hear the sound is too clean and sharp. But there are collectors who have their houses full of those \u2018vintage\u2019 pianos. Everything that carries the name Rhodes is not on sale anywhere now, I think. Modern electric pianos are different, but an average one comes with maybe with 3-band EQ, or some presets like attack and sustain. But there are electric pianos that are just called pianos, in fact, those are the same pianos with an $500 heavy sound card inserted, and that is that thing that can be fine-tuned via a small notebook, \u2014 if the interface has the right \u2018in\u2019 sockets. Rhodes sound is famous for its being warm and analogue to the ear, modern software is very capable of recreating the sound, but you\u2019ll have to turn hundreds of knobs on screen on those synths before you tweak the sound to your ear, the way you want it. Almost all of the software synths have this \u201cNoise\u201d fader, as I understood correctly, this is what makes the output sound live, not like a pre-programmed robot. Also, there are pedals on electric pianos, again, customizable for your needs through the soft synth. And very important factor: majority electric pianos like Rhodes, they have built-in audio outputs, when they were manufactured a long time ago, there was timbre, not plastic, so totally different sound. This is in case of the more than good hearing. Overall experience of playing a vintage electric piano actually means the form-factor itself, the real keys, those ones that a tiny bit smaller than the real piano ones, the audio playing from the front, that is why for some people this set-up is very important, the tactile sense of the average MIDI controller keyboard is awfully different compared even to the electric pianos that were built 60 years ago. And bad plug-ins actually have one note, that digitally expanded all through the keyboard, it is obvious, that this sound is no good. Good synths and plug-ins already come with each key sampled, so that is not gonna sound like a one octave synths from the toys stores for kids. This is an important factor to check out, when choosing a library or whatever it might be. As of today, many famous artists, who emerged from the past, like Ozzy Osbourne or Aerosmith, they can record the vintage pianos at the studios, but when playing live, there\u2019s just someone pushing the button of the recorded sample. These days, they make crazy things like an automatic tuning bridge on the Gibson guitars, that needs power, or MIDI guitars, \u2014 it is all about marketing. There are terrible quality synths for phones and pads that are plug and play and record through an interface of a beginner customer level. Include absolutely not needed stuff like a built-in tuner, and the instrument is already much more expensive than the one without it. Today, it\u2019s not about music, it\u2019s about music business. But those analogue instruments exist, there are lots of collectors, it\u2019s possible to buy a fully-functioning instrument, that is going to cost a lot, but you\u2019ll have an access to a unique experience which point has drowned in the market of quantity, not quality.

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s usually one obvious reason a company stops making something. People are longer buying them. Or at least not enough of them for make it profitable. The Fender-Rhodes is a pain in the butt to move around. Heavy and bulky. But bands like the ones I started out in did it because the Fender-Rhodes was the sound. You couldn't get the sound any other way. And they were touch-sensitive like an acoustic piano and some players felt they needed that. Some players used Wurlitzers instead but they were a different (and again unique) sound (reference: Ray Charles \u201cWhat\u2019d I Say\u201d ). Synthesizers were at that time just as inconvenient to carry around, and were fine for getting certain sounds but not these sounds, and to many bands the Fender-Rhodes sound and feel was essential, while synth sounds of that time were not. Now with digital sounds a lot of keyboard players I know are always looking for the new best Fender-Rhodes sound but there clearly a lot of great ones. Not to mention Hammond\u2014and Farfisa\u2014organ sounds. And many use a Wurlitzer sound as well. And they can choose a synth keyboard workstation they like the feel of. You\u2019ll still see the Fender-Rhodes in use. Pretty much always at a big concert with a professional road crew and a cartage company involved and a big budget so the keyboard player can have whatever he or she wants. ",
