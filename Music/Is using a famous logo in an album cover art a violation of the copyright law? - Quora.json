            "answer_text": "As Laloyan V said, if the logo is protected by copyright, using it without permission is infringement. But many logos do not qualify for copyright protection, however. In the US, for example, if a logo consists of nothing more than lettering, even stylized lettering, and simple geometric shapes, it is not protected by copyright. Think about how many logos can be described as just lettering with or without a simple shape. A huge number. Perhaps the majority. From the US Copyright Office website FAQ: \u201cHow do I copyright a name, title, slogan, or logo?Copyright does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases. In some cases, these things may be protected as trademarks. Contact the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, TrademarkAssistanceCenter@uspto.gov or see Circular 33, for further information. However, copyright protection may be available for logo artwork that contains sufficient authorship. In some circumstances, an artistic logo may also be protected as a trademark.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Logos are trademarked not copyrighted. I don\u2019t know if trademark law falls under copyright law but maybe this article will shed some light. Are Logos Copyrighted or Trademarked? Here\u2019s an excerpt: Copyright \u00a9 vs. Trademark \u00ae According to the United States Copyright Office, copyright protects original works created in a fixed form including \u201cliterary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works.\u201d Copyright is identified by the \u00a9 mark. According to thee United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), trademark protects \u201cwords, names, symbols, sounds or colors that distinguish goods and services from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods.\u201d If something is trademarked it is identified by the \u00ae mark. To put this as simply as possible, both copyright and trademark protect intellectual property (things created or designed by the company) \u2014 they just protect different types of intellectual property. Copyright protects things the company produces. Trademark protects things that identify the company to customers and differentiate against competitors: fonts, colors, sounds, and logos. In any case, any big company will protect their logo and stop you from using it if they so desire. Any smaller company might do the same. ",
