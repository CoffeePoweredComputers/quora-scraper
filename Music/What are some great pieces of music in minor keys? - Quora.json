I especially like the 3rd Movement! - - Concerto Grieg: Piano Concerto in A minor Elgar: Cello Concerto in E minor The opening bars of the above concertos are just so epic! Mozart: Piano Concerto in D minor - - Orchestral Mozart Symphony no. 40 in G minor Beethoven: Symphony no. 5 in C minor Beethoven: Symphony no. 9 in D minor The Beethoven Symphonies are arguably THE greatest symphonies of all time! - - Sacred Music Allegri: Miserere Mei, Deus The story behind this choral work in G minor and the legend of Mozart's transcription is as fascinating as the piece itself! Go Google it! Haydn: Mass in D minor Faure: Requim in D minor - - Others: Bach: Toccata and Fugue in D minor (Organ) The quintessential organ piece! Schubert: Erlk\u00f6nig in G minor. My favourite lieder from the lied master! Paganini: Caprice no. 24 in A minor ",

            "answer_text": "It's important to understand that many great classical pieces consist of several movements which are often in related but different keys. Composers use different keys and switch from major to minor and vice versa to give the work variety and keep it interesting for listeners. The keys of symphonies frequently mean the key of the first movement, though one or more other movements may also be in the same key and there can often (though not always) be a return to the home key in the last movement. Among Mozart's 41 numbered symphonies there are two in a minor key, the most famous being no.40 in G minor and this returns to G minor after a slow movement in a related major key. Beethoven wrote 2 symphonies in minor keys, the 5th (in C minor) and the 9th (in D minor), though in both instances there is a transition to a major key in the last movement. This is part of the composer's plan to start of stormy or moody and then transition to a triumphant victory or \"happy ending\". There are many more works in minor keys but these might be a good place to start. ",
