Well she\u2019s the artist who made this beautiful picture as well as many others. Her art often has psychological meanings, and they represent deep things. So this photo depicts someone surrounded by hurtful, degrading words that people are using to describe her. Despite this, she peacefully paints the word that truly describes her on the brick she holds. Beautiful. I think this photo represents Jimin very well. He has been called so many terrible things by people he didn\u2019t even know. Sometimes he let it get to his head, which caused him to hurt himself. He began to believe the cruel words of others. Those words started to become his own. However, in the end, he is able to accept himself for who he is and ignore the voices of those who don\u2019t truly know him. Jimin knows by now that he is not what those evil words say. The brick that he holds is the only one that belongs inside of him, because it is the only one that truly describes him. He is beautiful. Inside and out. This picture is a beautiful representation of him accepting that. \ud83d\udc9c ~Laura \u262e\ufe0f ",
