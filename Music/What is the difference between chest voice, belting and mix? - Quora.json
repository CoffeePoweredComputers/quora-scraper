            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll use the International Italianate terminology here. The speaking, or chest, voice register (aka heavy mechanism) is used in speaking and shouting; everybody uses this intuitively. The head, or lighter register, doesn\u2019t really function too much without training, especially in men\u2019s voices. Falsetto voice uses the light musculature but only the edges of the vocal folds vibrate, and there\u2019s usually an air leak, resulting in a breathy sound. It\u2019s not suitable for most classical singing. The balanced sound, or voce piena in testa (full voice in head), refers to a voice that\u2019s been trained to engage both the chest and head voice muscles with appropriate breath energy and posture to produce the sounds we have come to associate with the concert and opera stage. It\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201cmixed voice.\u201d \u201cBelting\u201d is restricted to the musical theater / jazz / pop world, and indicates using more of that heavy mechanism in the mix than a classical singer would use. Singers who use too much heavy mechanism can have big trouble - Adele is a sad example of this. Ethel Merman was one of the greatest belters and had a long, successful career. Optimal balancing of these registers (mix) takes a lot of training with teachers who understand the process. ",
