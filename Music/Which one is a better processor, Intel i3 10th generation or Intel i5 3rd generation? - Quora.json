            "answer_text": "I can give you the straight and obvious answer that intel i3 10th gen is better,Happy?Now lets get to the serious time inducing questions. What if both the gens is the same, ie an intel i3 10th gen and an intel i5 10th gen. Obviously the i5 will beat the daylights out of the i3. I3 is good but that doesnt technically mean it can handle load, Nope not at all. Incase you game, incase u stream, incase u do both at the same time, u need a better processor. Sooo take everything into account before buying. Who knows when is the next time you might buy a better system. ",

            "answer_text": "Intel has many security bugs in its CPUs before 10th generation. There are a few security bugs even in 10th generation. Patches are installed automatically through Windows updates for these bugs but the patches reduce performance by 2 - 40% depending on other hardware. Hyper-threading is normally stopped by these patches. AMD Ryzen is the only choice. Normally the latest CPU is always better. However anything below i7 or AMD Ryzen 5 is not suitable for today\u2019s day and age. Also 16 GB ram with 3200 mhz necessary. HDD is obsolete use SSD or M.2 Nvme drive. ",
