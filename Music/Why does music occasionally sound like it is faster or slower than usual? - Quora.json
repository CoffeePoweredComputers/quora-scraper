            "answer_text": "So a couple things could be going on. If you are talking about a song you hear at a concert versus how fast it is on the recorded version there is a very good chance the artist decided to either speed up or slow down the song to make it more presentable live. This could mean speeding it up to give it more energy, or slowing it down to make it more dramatic and emotional. If you are talking about your perception of the speed while listening to recorded music here is what is probably happening: When listening to music your mind will sort of naturally adapt to the rhythm/tempo of the songs you are listening to. A good example would be if you are walking with headphones on, you may not notice it, but you may start to subconsciously sync your steps with the beat. That doesn\u2019t happen to everybody but it does for me. Anyways if you are listening to a bunch of slow songs and then a song that is faster comes on, it will seem sped up because your brain has subconsciously adjusted to the slower tempo of the slower songs. Same thing if you are listening to fast songs and then a slow song comes on and seems slower than usual. It is simply how your brain perceives time, and after it has adjusted to a beat/tempo anything outside that beat/tempo may seem sped up or slowed down. Hope that helps! ",
