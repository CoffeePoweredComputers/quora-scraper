They are also good for mixing too. You should have a reference on bass translation in your mix. Don\u2019t mix with your \u201cgears\u201d, mix with your \u201cears\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "For mixing, and in their price range, they compete well with 8\" monitors from JBL, KRK, etc. Depends on the sound you like (and who you ask). But if you don't have a subwoofer, a hip-hop or EDM track will not sound like it does in the club. You can still mix on these, as long as you have a good reference as to what pro tracks sound like on these speakers. ",
