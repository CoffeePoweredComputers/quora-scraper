            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026. Do you really think that if people watch your videos it is definite that they will subscribe to your channel too? The answer is NO So if you check the total views and subscribers of any channel you will find that views of any channel are much more than the number of subscribers. The reason :- Some people may like your video some may not so those who dont will not like the video will not subscribe the channel. And even some who like the video may not susbscribe because of other reasons Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "At the end of every video do you tell them to subscribe, if so then you can add by saying that you will randomly choose a winner for the subscribers. If you don\u2019t tell them to subscribe then there is your problem, people like to move on to the next video after watching your videos. You have to remind them to subscribe to keep coming back for more awesome content. Another case, could be that they don\u2019t like your content and they might not think it\u2019s original. Always have fresh and new ideas to make your YouTube channel unique. ",
