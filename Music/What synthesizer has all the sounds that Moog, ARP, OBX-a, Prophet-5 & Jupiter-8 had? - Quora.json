            "answer_text": "Seeing these were all synths with a unique sound of their own - once you know what you are looking for you can pick a Moog from an Oberheim in a mix - and each had lots of knobs and their own special sweet spots (and ugly tricks) then there can\u2019t really be one instrument that can do all of that. Also, don\u2019t forget that the sound of a synth on a record in 1982 was not the same sound as the very same synth in 1992. The way they were played, recorded, processed & mixed changed radically. Just listen to the TR-808 over time. The 808 in Techno is a very different beast from that on \u201cSexual Healing\u201d. Oh yes the sample bots & clone synths will claim that you get that magic in their package/s but I will be Devil\u2019s Advocate here and say that you don\u2019t really. If vaguely near enough is good enough and you will feel better for having the Roland Stripes on the GUI then go for it. But it is maybe not the best course. Here I show my feelings and some cold hard realities about Arturia\u2019s CZ emulation. Now I know you didn\u2019t mention that synth but if you pay attention, you see how these emulations are not really the \u201creal\u201d thing at all but a new instrument based on some of the feel of the original - often through the eyes of someone with a different era-sense of what that instrument sounded like. The FX in this are not remotely like those used in the mid-80s when this was new and on-record. They queer that sound very much to today\u2019s tastes. QED, not really CZ.  To try to answer you Q simply (as I have chased the feel of all those synths as I heard them on my records) then Thor, Subtractor & Europa are all you really need. Or if you want a freebie then Surge is very capable indeed.  The trade-off is that you have to learn to program those sounds yourself. I will say that is a good thing as in trying to sound like one thing, you can find your thing. Duran Duran was trying very hard to sound like Japan. They failed but gave us what made Duran Duran amazing. This is how we find what makes us special as artists. Or you build a working relationship with a synthesist. This is what most bands did. Either they made a synthesist a member of the band or hired in one or more to sit around making cool sounds that went on record and then were played by someone else on stage. Larry Fast was THE name for that in the 70s & 80s. Trent Reznor commonly had a person or two on staff for that for him and NIN - one of those fellows you know as Steve Duda of Serum. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok this is tricky. I think softsynth wise have a look at arturia collection - very good virtual emulations of a lot of old synths. https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/v-collection/overview#enincludes \u2022Includes 24 software titles: Mellotron V, Synthi V, CZ V, Analog Lab, Clavinet V, CMI V, DX7 V, Buchla Easel V, Synclavier V, B-3 V, Mini V, Piano V, Stage-73 V, Matrix-12 V, Farfisa V, Solina V, SEM V, Wurli V, Jup-8 V, ARP 2600 V, CS-80 V, Prophet V, VOX Continental V, Modular V Another option would be to just cherry pick the synths you want or if you just want presets than arturia lab may be a good option. Hardware wise this is a lot trickier as no one synth would cover these unless you decide to go down modular synth route and built your own versions out of modules etc. Eurorack is probably the most popular. There\u2019s plenty of moog type. Modules with Behringer bringing out System 55 Modular Synthesizer which will be budget emulations of classic moog hardware. ",
