            "answer_text": "Well this answer is a little late but i am going to answer anyways\u2026. Since this question is asking about my opinion I will only be stating my opinion REMEBER ONLY MY OPINION.. First off all it's already 2020 so both groups have already changed so much. For example- Twice's old songs were more cutesy (not that I hate it), but they have changed into a much more mature style now like fancy, more and more and now they are going to release a 2nd full album called eyes wide open, and the b-side track titles are also really cool\u2026 For blackpink I can't say that they have changed so much but they did. I mean in their song ice cream featuring selena gomez they also said that they were trying to show their cute side of themselves and they did and their first full album titled \u2018the album\u2019 had really amazing songs, even though it had only 8 songs (which is a little few compared to twice since their 2nd full album which they are going to release now has 13 songs BUT REMEMBER THIS IS JUST MY OPINION). Overall I always loved twice b-side tracks and I still love them now and it is getting much better and better on the other hand I only heard blackpink's really and some other songs since they didn't have that many b-side tracks but in their latest album \u2018The Album' their b-side tracks really didn't disappoint they were really amazing. Now moving on to the choreographies, I have to say that twice did have a really easier choreography when they did songs like cheer up but now I have to say that Twice's choreograhies got really harder especially from dance the night away to more and more. I mean their dancing skills are really amazing and they are really synchronized.   On the other hand blackpink's choreographies are also hard but not as hard as twice. Ywice makes their choreographies look much easier, but blackpink's dance are also really hard. Both their choreographies are really amazing.   Vocals: (THIS IS JUST MY OPINION) I think both of then are really and unique in their own way. Blackpink rose and jisoo are really good but in my opinion rose voice really sounds amazing but after a while I usually get bored. Jennie and lisa's position is main rapper and main dancer respectively but their vocals are really good. As seen from jennie's song \u2018solo\u2019 and lisa in their song \u2018you never know\u2019 and many other songs.       Twice vocals are also really amazing. Their high notes are really amazing especially dungeon in like a fool, jihyo in one in a million and many others. Jeong yeon, jihyo, mina, nayeon, tzuyu and sana'a voices are good and unique in their own ways. Dahyun is the lead rapper but I think her vocals are good as seen from her cover of twice's feel special. Chaeyoung voice I also really good. If you see momo's voice from the times from sixteen and some other twice b-side tracks you will find that her voice is not really that same as in more and more etc. I think it is because she has a low tone voice but mostly their songs are high pitched.       Rap: I have to say that jennie and lisa's raps are better. They both are really great and rose and jisoo's rap are also not that bad. It's just that chaeyoung's raps are also really great but their songs really don't have that much raps so she doesn't really show her skills but its changing and I think she will more rap lines in the future. Dahyun is much more of a vocalist I think but her rapping skills are also really great but I think I prefer momo's raps over her.    Visuals: Both are really stunning. Overall, both are really talented and stunning in their own ways. REMEMBER THIS IS ALL BASED ON MY OPINION, SO FEEL FREE TO AGREE OR DISAGREE. ",

            "answer_text": "Dance:people keep saying that blackpink is better than twice at dancing but that isnt really true. Blackpink has a very strong choreography. Whereas twice has \u201ccute and easy\" ones. As people like to say. But that is wrong. I guess people who say that really havent seen the twice dance breaks that they do on almost all award shows. Those dance breaks are hella hard and strong. So strong, that some how cute becomes hiphop all of a sudden but the aura still remains. And that shocks most idols and fans (audiences) from their core. And they just never really got to show what they got before because of their concept and still somehow managed to show their moves and shock us. Just look at fancy. It was definitely not their usual dance. Tbh, yes or yes and dance the night away were hella hard too. At least in comparison to blackpink choreographies. And I mean ALL blackpink choreos. Another thing about blackpink is that they have many repetitive moves that make me bored by watching them. And individually, between lisa and momo, I'd say momo. Cause Lia Kim choosing her to be the top female idom dancer and a lot of other idols always mentioning her name as well, them being all professionals. But don't get me wrong, lisa is an exceptionally talented dancer too. 2. Vocal: So in terms of vocal, both ros\u00e8 and jihyo/nayeon are extremely impressive. Especially rose. However, ros\u00e8 has this tendency of making nasal sounds so it sounds really off on live stages. And mr removed videos also showed how blackpinks vocals are unstable on live stages. Theyve come a far way from that though. So have twice. But I would say twice because they have three power vocalists, jeongyeon, nayeon and jihyo. Even mina. But then again the number of members matter too. 3. Rap: Jennie and lisa are an iconic rap duo. They legit spit fire. They have the rhythm, rhyme, flow, ability to match with the beat. They're definitely better. But I would have o give credits o chaeyoung for writing her own raps. Other than that, twice rapping skills arent exactly very impressive. But I I jyp for not letting them show off their talents. I mean. he makes chaeyoung sing more than rap. In fact, in dtna and feel special, she didnt even rap. 4. Humour/entertainment: Twice. They are completely natural and dont even have to try and are already hella funny and cute as well as entertaining. Blackpink on the other hand, fakes it a lot. They arent naturally cute. They are not naturally funny. They have to try hard to be entertaining. This might come off as rude but I am only stating facts that I observed. But in the beginning, even twice faked it a lot and made it seem cringey. Ig with blackpink too they seemed \u201cfake\" cause they recently debuted. And then when they werent rookies anymore, YG didnt even give them a chance to show them their true personality. 5. Activity: This isnt even a comparison. Only when it comes to the western side will blackpink act all busy but in Korea, it's no lie that their company too lazy to do anything for them except one comeback per year. They literally have NO full album in 3 years. They barely ever attend any korean award shows. They are barely ever seen on Korean variety TV shows. While twice attend EVERY single award show that they are invited to and have MULTIPLE comebacks per year. And you can even see how awkward blackpink feel whenever they attend any korean award show, since they dont usually do that. But yg is to blame for blackpink's inactivity. 6. Sales + awards Twice. Maybe if YG wasnt a snake and let blackpink attend award shows more and if he didnt fuck with no big award shows, blackpink could have gotten more awards. Probably not as much as twice though, because of the one year gap and koreans opinions. And sales, BLACKPINK has had like 13 songs and no full album, what do you expect? Amounts of awards won by twice: 75 (11 daesangs) and nominated for 177 awards. Amount of awards won by blackpink: 24 (0 daesangs) and nominated : 92 7. Popularity: Blackpink. Worldwide and now even in Korea blackpink beats twice. People who bring up twice being more popular in korea and japan are only trynna defend twice, and I'm saying this as a once. Because blackpink took over worldwide popularity, automatically they gained popularity in korean, more then twice. In japan too, twice isnt that popular. Yes. More popular than blackpink. But not too popular. 8. Views: Its obviously blackpink for individual views but the total mvs would be twice because of the amount of the mvs they have compared to blackpink. But now that ddu ddu du has hit 1 billion views, I'm pretty sure blackpink leads in number of total views as well. 9. Visual: Both have really attractive members so dont get me started on this one. Both of them are equal in this. So overall, twice wins. ",

            "answer_text": "Now since it's 2019 and both groups had launched their new songs which are \u2018kill this love' from Blackpink and \u2018fancy' from Twice,we could see a huge difference between these groups. We could say that both groups have different concepts as their themes. For Blackpink, they seem to be more on being fierce and sexy while Twice, they are focusing on being cute and lovely. Both of the teams'concepts are unique in their own way and loved by most people. For their members, everyone plays a big role and important. Eventough Blackpink has less members compare to Twice,they can still be as great as Twice means that Blackpink\u2019s members are versatile. I realised that many people compare the groups' main vocalists which are Rose' from Blackpink and Jihyo from Twice. In my personal opinion, both of them are great and impressive. It's a tie competition.For Rose', people adore her for her light and unique voice while Jihyo, people give her credits for her great singing technique. BOTH WIN. For rapping, both teams' have great rappers. Lisa\u2019s accent makes her rap sounds very cool while Chaeyoung's rap is so fun to be heard.Personally,I think we should give our credits more to Lisa.She\u2019s not a korean but still, she can rap \u2018korean lyric\u2019 rap parts .Both are great. For their dancing skills and coreography,there\u2019s an obvious difference between these two groups.Twice\u2019s dance coreography is catchy and cute while Blackpink, their coreography is sexy and cool. Eventough there's a big difference between their dance coreography, both teams have same amount of fans.People love both teams just the way they are. For their visuals, ALL OF THEM ARE BEAUTIFUL AND CUTE. They have \u2018goddesses looking' visuals.But personally, I fall in love with Lisa due to her unique visual. I think this is because of her face that doesn't look like an asian differents with the other members of Blackpink and Twice. For their new mvs, it's hard to say that eventough I'm trying to tell everyone that both teams are equally great, Blackpink's Kill this love wins compare to Twice's Fancy. Just look at the viewers. Kill this love made a new record as the most viewed video in 24 hours. But it doesnt means that Twice\u2019s fancy is not good. Its catchy beats make this mv looks so nice. By the way, it's no use for us to compare Blackpink and Twice to find the best group because at the end, we'll find out that both teams are equally great. ",

            "answer_text": "I am more of a once than a blink so my opinions might be bias but I will try not to be. So let's get started Music - people mostly prefer girl crush concepts but I like both concepts equally [ girl crush as well as cute]. Twice get a lot of hate for their concept but I don't think that there is anything wrong with aegyo shilling, cute concept. But since they have also changed their concept [in fancy and feel special and it also seems like \u2018more & more\u2019 will be something different], I am going to choose twice in this category. I am also kinda a bit bored with bp concept. Vocals - Now this category is a draw for me. A lot of people do prefer Jihyo's vocals over rose but tbh I like them equally. I really love Rose's voice and it is such a misfortune how she is forced to sing like that. Jisoo's husky voice is not my favourite but she is very stable. Nayeon's voice is a little bit too cute for me but jeongyeon's vocals are very underrated. The truth is that both the vocals of bp as well as twice are not very good. However they are still improving!! Rap- this category is won by bp. They are just known for their rap. Twice raps are pretty weak tbh. However chaeyang is such a great rapper but jyp doesn't let her show her rap skills. In bp I like Lisa's rap over Jennie. I don't know but it is just her tone and her rap skills that just caught my attention more. I am not a rapper or a music artist so these are just my opinions. Dance - This category is again a draw for me. Momo and Lisa are both absolutely amazing dancers,so I can't choose between them. Rose and Mina are not very behind as well. Personality - Now this is completely arbitrary and I might get a lot of hate for this. To all the blinks I am really sorry but I have to say that bp's personality just seems a little bit fake to me like in interviews. Don't get me wrong on this. I really love all blackpink members but I don't know why it seems to me like that. Jisoo is an exception. So this category, twice wins for me. The next two categories are popularity, sales and awards but please keep in mind that these should not influence ones opinion on any group. So popularity and awards and sales don't really matter but none the less I have added them in this answer. Awards and sales - we all know twice wins in this category. Popularity - Although twice is more popular in parts of Asia, the truth is that blackpink is very popular in both West as well as asia [ even though bp are not as popular as twice in Asia]. So bp wins this category. Conclusion - overall both groups are amazing and deserves the fame that they have but I will chose twice since their concept and personality seems more appealing to me. I also love how once get regular videos and pictures on insta from twice. Please keep in mind that this is just my opinion and you are not forced to agree with it. I am an open minded person so feel free to share your opinion in the comments [even negative comments can be written] In general Stan TWICEPINK and stop fan wars.   Hope this helped. ~adios\ud83d\ude0a ",

            "answer_text": "They are both amazing groups. Many might say that they are overrated because they are from JYP and YG. Many might say that other groups are way more talented. Many will probably say other groups are better \u201cidols\u201d because they have better vocals. However, in my opinion, these two are not overrated at all. Sure, there are groups who have better vocals but many should remember that being an \u201cidol\u201d is not just about being vocally good. The word \u201cidol\u201d is much broader than what we think. It involves charm, charisma, star quality, \u201cit\u201d factor, beauty, personality, and doing well in other section of the entertainment industry. In TWICE\u2019s case, they are a very natural group. They have almost everything. Vocal wise, if you really do follow the group, you will know just how great their vocal abilities are. In addition, their dancing skills are no joke. Although many might argue that a lot of groups have better vocal ability, TWICE is obviously better on the other sections of their work (being an idol). They are probably one of the best (if not the best) groups when it comes to visuals. No matter where you look, you\u2019ll always see a girl that is above average when it comes to visual but visual isn\u2019t the only thing. The \u201cshy shy shy\u201d is one of the many proofs of just how much charm they have. It could be given to anyone but it wouldn\u2019t receive that much attention. If you would think about it deeply, it\u2019s not really a \u201ckiller part\u201d but why? It is hard to explain but TWICE is group of girls born to become idols. Mina who is very quite, reserved and elegant gains a lot of attention and love even though she does not act crazy like other idols do. Also, the popularity among members is almost fairly distributed. Some are of course more popular but the difference is not big. Chaeyoung and Jihyo and probably not the most popular in Korea but they have a lot of international fans. The \u201cit\u201d factor and charm that they have are something that you will never get from training. The first time I saw them, I knew they were gonna be big. They have that elegant and high quality feeling when they stand and perform but they are very dorky outside the stage. Also, their flexibility can guarantee their longevity. Once people are tired of the color pop concept, they have more to offer. They are just born to be Korea\u2019s next \u201cNation\u2019s Girl Group\u201d. They are very different from Girls\u2019 Generation but both groups have unexplainable charm that no matter how trainees try to follow they just can\u2019t. On the other hand, BLACKPINK, their unique concept is what makes them very popular. To be able to pull-off that swagger, bad-ass yet expensive feeling kind of concept is hard. Also what makes them different from 2ne1 is that they have that cute feeling. YG seems to have really trained them to become idols. They give us that feeling that only YG artists can give but they have that \u201ccutesy\u201d feeling too that Koreans like. For example in Boombayah, the song is very confident and has a girl crush feel and then suddenly, they will scream \u201coppa!\u201d. The members visual is also a big part of their image as idol. They look very sweet but they pull-off those swagger raps and songs. More than the Korean market, they appeal more to the Western people. The quality of their music makes them better too. Their song releases always top the chart not because they are in YG because obviously you will not continuously listen to a song because of the brand but because of the addictive feeling it gives you. They are just new and YG doesn\u2019t show them on public much except when they perform music so the public gets that curious feeling. In my perspective, I like TWICE more. Although BLACKPINK\u2019s concept is hard, I believe that TWICE\u2019s concept is harder. To be able to have people say \u201cAH! She\u2019s so cute\u201d is quite harder than you think. Sometimes other idols go overboard when they are performing and it becomes cringe-worthy but in TWICE\u2019s case, they can make people genuinely say they are so cute. Also, they have shown different concepts from Sixteen up until TWICELand and they always pull it off. I usually like girl groups with bad-ass feeling just like 2ne1 but there is just something about TWICE that amazes me and hooks me up. Their improvements always warm my heart. I have never wanted to protect a celebrity except them and Jessica Jung. When they cry, my heart breaks and it\u2019s not just because I love their music but because they make their fans feel close to them. Music wise, their music gets more and more addictive overtime. Their type of music is quite new (considering it\u2019s color pop). They never fail to deliver catchy songs. Although some catchy songs gets tiring and boring as time goes by, TWICE\u2019s music doesn\u2019t. The other tracks in their albums doesn\u2019t disappoint too. Their song One in a Million is a really good song. At first it is catchy but when you hear the lyrics, you just can\u2019t help but feel special. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t hate any of them but since they are from the big three, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s easy for them to get fame and attention. What\u2019s hard is for them to show that they deserve the hype around them. For Twice, i used to dislike them but they seem like good girls so i don\u2019t dislike them anymore. But objectively speaking, not all of them are really special in their individual talent. I give momo for her dancing, but the rest are pretty much just mediocre i think ( vocals and raps are not strong enough). For concept, cute concept isn\u2019t really my preference and that used to be one of the reason why i disliked them (so immature i know). But now, i kinda support them for being cute and not always following the trend of concepts and stay being cute. At least their consistence and their concept is not messy, cause to be honest, some groups are pretty messy and inconsistent of their concepts. But i gotta be real, SOME ( not all okay) of their songs are pretty much similar to each other which is very unfortunate. And their company gave them way too many comebacks in a short amount of time are they trying to kill them? For Blackpink, i used to like them but now not so much. There\u2019s nothing wrong with them it\u2019s just that i was too hyped at the beginning and couldn\u2019t keep up with the same energy towards them. For their talents individually, i must admit they are a little better than twice. For music, some of their musics are cool but some are also just hit or miss to me. Their dancing is cooler i guess but that\u2019s because the difference of their concepts. I do prefer girl crush more than cute but there\u2019s something about blackpink\u2019s style that seems too repetitive i guess(?) Both bp and twice are consistent with their concept and if twice is a little bit repetitive with their songs, bp is a little bit repetitive in the style of their mvs and comebacks. That doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing, and i\u2019m not a professional or something but it\u2019s just my opinion. But something that i like about them is that they keep the uniqueness of kpop with the bright colors and the set of their mvs. ",

            "answer_text": "*Note: don\u2019t comment or say something to me unless you FULLY read every part of this answer. VOCALS: Both groups probably tie in vocals to be honest. I haven\u2019t seen much of Twice singing ballads or impressive covers or something like that but they seem to be consistent in their vocals. BLACKPINK have unique vocals and are also pretty good vocalists, even if they aren\u2019t as amazing as MAMAMOO or something. Don\u2019t come at me saying \u201cTwice can\u2019t sing/is talentless\u201d Or \u201cblackpink can\u2019t sing/is talentless\u201d. Karen, they did NOT TRAIN FOR YEARS and DEBUT UNDER THE BIGGEST COMPANIES in Korean entertainment BY BEING TALENTLESS OR NOT HARD-WORKING.DANCE: I\u2019d have to give this to BLACKPINK in terms of choreography, as Twice is choreography is just very very simple, but it still is appealing. Blackpink as the harder choreographies but in terms of looking good I\u2019d say they both have choreographies that suit the group and look good on stage, but maybe Twice\u2019s look better as there are more members. As for dancing skill, I can\u2019t say. Lisa and Momo are insanely good dancers and the other girls are all pretty good too.RAP: BLACKPINK. Not being rude but Chaeyoung and Dahyun just seem like idol rappers or people who can rap, whereas Jennie seems like she has quite a bit of potential and could be an actual rapper. She naturally has more swag, a unique style, and (quite a bit) experience writing lyrics. Lisa also is fairly good. Chaeyoung and Dahyun are still talented though, no hate.COMEBACKS: Twice. But also BLACKPINK. Let me explain. Twice have more comebacks and each one is pretty good (I mean I personally dislike Twice\u2019s music a lot but objectively speaking) and while BLACKPINK don\u2019t have as many comebacks, due to shitty management, when they do, it\u2019s amazing. Wish they could fully display their capabilities and actually get an album though.Honestly this was just a breakdown of each group in different categories NOT a comparison/competition. Both groups are very talented and hardworking. \u2014 As for BLACKPINK? If you don\u2019t agree with me, PLEASE PLEASE, I beg of you, the very least you can do for me is read this answer. If you\u2019re willing to change and have an open mind I highly suggest you read Kazumi Hatake's answer to What is something you need to get off your chest about your favorite idol or group? Just honestly read all through that answer and watch the videos and then tell me your opinion on BLACKPINK. Please note this answer was written by a Blink and someone who doesn\u2019t like cutesy concepts or any of twice\u2019s title tracks really. (i only like breakthrough, signal, touchdown, stuck in my head, and hot.) Okay that\u2019s it, Stan TwicePink!   ",

            "answer_text": "They both have the advantage of being from big three companies, so it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re going to have an edge over most girl groups from the very beginning. Their music is high quality and they\u2019re marketed very well as a result of being from JYP and YG respectively. Yeah, you could say they\u2019re \u2018overrated\u2019. There\u2019s definitely other groups that have the \u2018it\u2019 factor but not the brand (company), which is a pity. Musically, it\u2019s a different story. Overall, Blackpink is definitely more individually talented, and, well, more talented in general. They\u2019ve honed their skills a lot, but hey, what else do you expect from girls that\u2019ve spent years cooped up in YG\u2019s basement? Twice does extremely well digitally, though, which is their biggest leverage. They\u2019ve released catchy songs after songs that sat well with Korea\u2019s general public, thus leading to more popularity. Their cute, light, poppy concept doesn\u2019t appeal to a broader fanbase, though\u2014they\u2019re not nearly as popular in the west. But they\u2019re pretty girls, they have potential, and they\u2019ve maxed out their cuteness level, which is why they\u2019re pretty popular in Asia. I like Blackpink better, though. Ros\u00e9\u2019s voice is distinct and easy on the ears, Jisoo\u2019s voice is surprisingly pleasant, and Jennie is admittedly good vocal-wise, though I feel like she could broaden her rapping. Lisa\u2019s a great dancer, only time will tell what her rapping skills will become. I will say though Twice has great visuals and attractive personalities, though I lean more towards Blackpink. Their music is more my style and their music skills are more honed than Twice\u2019s. Pretty sure they\u2019ll be reminiscent of SNSD and 2NE1 in a way\u2014not that Twice can touch SNSD yet, but the concept is sort of similar. My only wish is that Red Velvet can climb up there too\u2026sigh. ",

            "answer_text": "Twice and Blackpink are both huge girl groups with huge fanbases in both Korea and outside of Korea. In my opinion, both are well-rounded girl groups. I\u2019ve taken vocal lessons for about 7 years, and I think it\u2019s safe to say that Jihyo, Twice\u2019s main vocalist, has better technique than Rose, BP\u2019s main vocalist. Lisa and Momo, main dancers of both groups, have different dancing styles and have both been dancing for a long time. In my opinion, they both are very versatile and are pretty much on the same level. Blackpink definitely beats Twice out in terms of rap, although Chaeyoung from Twice is very skilled. In terms of the whole group, Twice doesn\u2019t have a single weak dancer, unlike BP, where Jisoo is working her way up still. In time, BP and Twice will even out in that aspect. However, Twice does lack a proper rap line, which BP does have. In terms of vocals, Blackpink has only 4 members, while Twice has 9. If we compare just the main and lead vocals of Twice and BP, for the most part, they are on the same level, although Jihyo is definitely stronger than Rose. Blackpink isn\u2019t marketed as well as Twice because YG is pretty bad at management of this girl group. Twice, on the other hand, is overworked but marketed very well. Twice is definitely more popular than BP in Korea. However, both groups have an insane Korean fanbase full of various kinds of fans. Internationally, Blackpink takes the lead. In the same way, Twice still has huge international popularity. In other words? They\u2019re both on about the same level. There\u2019s no TWICE > BP or BP > TWICE because both groups share about the same level of popularity and talent. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I prefer BlackPink In the vocal category, it\u2019s the weak point for both of them. However, I do like BlackPink\u2019s vocals more. They have variety in their voices. Jennie has a powerful voice, Jisoo has a husky voice, Ros\u00e9 has a really colorful voice, and Lisa has a deeper voice\u2026? I\u2019m not sure how to describe it. In twice, I prefer Jeongyeon\u2019s voice more, though I do find her vocals\u2026flat? Whereas Jihyo\u2019s vocals are evident that she trained for 10 years. Nayeon, I don\u2019t place her above Jeongyeon and Jihyo. In BlackPink, the weak vocal is Lisa. In twice, the weak vocals are Momo, Tzuyu, and some can argue Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Sana. In the average zone there are three levels, with one being the lowest and three being the highest. The rap line are in the average zone 1 for me. In average zone 3 are Sana and Jennie. Sana would make be lower than Jennie, particularly because her vocals seem a bit weak, but not really weak unlike Mina who makes into 2. In the highest vocal line would be Ros\u00e9, Jihyo, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, and Jisoo. My ranking for them would be: Ros\u00e9=\\> Jihyo>Jeongyeon=Jisoo, Nayeon Confusing? Ros\u00e9 is the same as/better than Jihyo, who are after Jeongyeon and Jisoo ranking the same, who beat Nayeon. Jihyo does beat Ros\u00e9 in some aspects at times, like high notes. But I prefer Ros\u00e9\u2019s vocals more since I\u2019m into more soothing ones. Her old feature in G-Dragon\u2019s song Without You and her cover of If It Is You along with the special stage of Butterfly in SBS makes her take the cake for me. I\u2019m not going to say Jihyo\u2019s a bad vocal, but she sometimes in lives she sounds really\u2026breathy. It sounds like she\u2019s breathing into the mic while singing. And example would be the butterfly stage and the infamous Melting live. \ud83d\ude2c Jeongyeon and Jisoo are both lead vocals. Their voice tones are completely different, but nevertheless I believe their skills to be near the same level. Nayeon is one who I believe to be weak in the vocal line. In rap, I prefer JenLisa. It\u2019s kinda expected. In dance, both Lisa and Momo are experts in their field. You can\u2019t really compare. ",

            "answer_text": "I honestly see TWICE as the 3rd generation SNSD (not the new SNSD, just the younger version if you will) and BLACKPINK as the 3rd generation (okay, I guess we can say new in this case T^T) 2NE1. I like both groups so far. I\u2019m more into BLACKPINK\u2019s songs just because some of TWICE\u2019s songs are too pop-like. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m a huge SNSD fan and SNSD is classic, but SNSD\u2019s early pop songs were unique to me compared to TWICE\u2019s. While listening to one of their albums, a lot of the songs sounded too similar to each other to me \u2014 they didn\u2019t stand out. But I do like their title tracks (mainly TT and Like Ooh Ahh, I can\u2019t stop listening to these two songs). Cheer Up was ruined because of the mispronunciation of \u2018Cheer Up\u2019. I sat there listening for the words \u201cCheer up\u201d but only heard \u201cShut up\u201d. Mispronunciation of the title of the song always gets me, just like \u201cWolf\u201d turning into \u201cOolf\u201d with EXO. Vocal-wise, I honestly would rank BLACKPINK higher. I don\u2019t know about dancing since I haven\u2019t really watched either their dance practices, music videos or live performances, but BLACKPINK has better vocals. TWICE members kind of have the typical K-Pop girl voice, but BLACKPINK is distinguishable and I personally think their vocals are also much stronger. ",

            "answer_text": "i\u2019m not gonna lie i\u2019m a blink but also likes twice this opinion isn\u2019t biased: DANCE: in individual, i think lisa is a bit better than Momo and ros\u00e9 is good too, but if you count all members twice wins. their choroes are easier and cuter, while blackpink\u2019s are harsh, but twice can freestyle in their dances too so twice wins. RAP: i know twice\u2019s rappers write their own raps, but their raps are easy and more of a catchy part than a real rap part, blackpink is yg so\u2026 jenlisa have also written their raps sometimes even though they are not allowed. jenlisa aren\u2019t average rap idols but they are good. So blackpink wins Vocals: Jihyo wins definitely. Rose forces her voice to be angelic and doesn\u2019t show her real voice. Jisoo is a very good vocalist and i know she can hit high notes, but they barely give them lines to show her vocals. Ros\u00e9 should return to her Without You (2012) voice, it\u2019s not that beautiful in the first sight, but she can hit the notes easily and maybe force her voice at any line, but she should use her real voice. Jihyo is just wonderful and a good songwriter too. i cried when i listened to Girls Like Us (2019). Visuals: All of them are beautiful so it\u2019s a tie. Stage Presence: Both of them give them maximum. Jennie had her attitude scandal last year, but she got over it, so it\u2019s okay. I think blackpink wins here. I like twice presence, but it\u2019s like they try to give the best in singing and dancing, but blackpink\u2019s presence is more attractive, cuz\u2019 they have fun too. Twice are also tired, because of JYP management. They get like 4 comebacks a year and they should get like 6 months rest immediately. It\u2019s a tie 2\u20132 so as you know both of them are great.

It\u2019s catchy and wonderful, but the disadvantage about their music is the members\u2019 voice are weaker than BLACKPINK or the other girlgroup like Red Velvet. BLACKPINK\u2019 style is cool and meanful. I like their two debut songs: BOOMBAYAH and Whistle, but their other two songs, which realesed after BOOMBAYAH and Whistle: Stay and Playing With Fire were really boring. However, their vocalists and rappers are great and their voice were beautiful. I expect more in this group.ChoreographEven ONCEs have to admitted that BLACKPINK has amazing choreograph, they have incredible dance skill and unique style of dancing. While then, TWICE has easy and adorable choreograph. I need something to prove that they can do it better. How about a cover? Not just Momo dancing, the whole group.VisualThe advantage that not every groups can have is each member of TWICE and BLACKPINK have their own visual and their own style of beauty. BLACKPINK\u2019 members somehow sexy and cool, especially Rose and Lisa. In the other hand, TWICE\u2019 members are more adorable and cheerful.So those are my general opinions about TWICE and BLACKPINK, I stan neither of them but I think they are good. ",

The members are really nice and sweet(even though i never met them in real life i\u2019m just saying) The thing that i like about twice is their music. It\u2019s so nice and catchy. I also like it that they have a new song coming up in every 2 months. blackpink: blackpink has a fierce concept like 2ne1. the members are really pretty and funny. I like their music but i didnt like their new album. I also dont like it that blackpink members are being shipped with EVERYONE!!! Like for example bts. First people used to ship lisa and jungkook,taehyung and jennie,rose and jimin,jisoo and jin and now people are creating fan wars and deciding which group is better. like a channel on youtube would make blackpink and bts ship videos and then recently they posted a video that was like Yg is trying to make blackpink more popular than bts. They\u2019ll never be as popular as bts and i\u2019m just like WHAT?!?! Like you just made a video 2 days ago that was like I LOVE JISOO AND JIN I HOPE THEY GET MARRIED and now you\u2019re creating fan wars?!?!?!?! So the main problem with blackpink is their fans. like not all fans but some crazy fans. like twice fans are so nice and calm but with blackpink its the opposite. It\u2019s also yg\u2019s fault for not giving the girls a comeback ",

            "answer_text": "Can I just start off by saying: I LOVE THEM BOTH SO MUCH!!!(sorry, me being a total fangirl XD) I think both of them are amazing in their own little way. I really hate how people are so negative to Twice, saying their vocals are terrible, how the line distributions are uneven, how their dances are too simple, and how they act so \u2018fake\u2019 because they\u2019re cute, how they are only popular because of their visuals, and how Blackpink is SOOO much better. I agree that Twice\u2019s vocals might not be as strong as Blackpink\u2019s and many other girlgroups (e.g Red Velvet), but they are still good singers and it\u2019s unfair that they\u2019re getting so badly criticized by society ;-; Their dances, I agree, are simpler than most others but its still been thought out very well and there is no need for people to bash them on choreography. I do think though that line distribution is kinda uneven but I guess JYP knows each member\u2019s strengths which is why they are assigned the lines they are given. But Twice is definitely not only popular for their visuals! I personally love their voices, especially Jungyeon\u2019s because it is so strong and clear when they\u2019re singing live! (my bias is Tzuyu btw ;)) With Blackpink, I was not really a big fan of them to begin with to be honest :P My friend let me listen to Boombayah and I didn\u2019t really like it that much, which is why I didn\u2019t listen to their other songs (which I regret because as I found out much later, They. Are. Awesome. ) Bias: Jisoo! <3 My opinions changed when I heard their latest song As If It\u2019s Your Last! I think what I really like about the group is that all members have different strengths e.g Lisa is the best dancer, Rose best vocal, Jisoo best visual, and Jennie leader (my opinion btw, all of them are amazing at everything :D), and of course their choreography and vocals are SO GOOD! When they sing live, I\u2019m always so blown away by how amazingly clear and strong their vocals are, especially Jennie\u2019s. End of \u2018rant\u2019. Sorry if I got a little carried away XD p.s if you like Blackpink and Twice, like me, follow my fanpages on instagram, @tzuyio and @blackpinkcentral :D ",

            "answer_text": "I used to be a blink and I will tell you that Fandom is toxic. I always bashed twice and other groups. But then I found no reason to Stan it. I was always waiting for their comeback but when ktl came I wasn't really satisfied with it. And then I watched twice. I started loving them. My first mv of them was fancy. Once are the luckiest Fandom. I agree with this a lot well it is not bp fault but just saying that won't help the fans. They are still waiting for comebacks. Tbh I don't have any main reason for liking twice more than BP. It is mainly due to comebacks I guess. I find a ton of content on YouTube for them which I love watching. I am not here to compare both of them and I have loved both of them. Currently I just like twice more but I will never forget bp as well since I got into kpop because of them. So my answer to this question ends here. Hopefully this helped you. In a common sense notion this is just my opinion and feel free to share your opinion in the comments. Both groups are nice and you just have to find your type.   ~adios \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a ",

So many Onces are here on Quora in the first place. \ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\ude05 I will just leave this here:  Can't wait for BlackPink's comeback album and collab with Lady Gaga. They're the hottest girl group right now worldwide. Even with a delayed comeback, they always rank so high in Kpop girl group brand rankings. Always trending with four talented girls that can all release solo music or content. And their Youtube views are really huge with limted contents available. The discrepancy between Twice and BlackPink is so huge overall with BlackPink leading in all platforms except in physical album sales but digital sales go to BlackPink. \ud83d\udc4d Twice is at its peak already with so many releases while BlackPink achieved all these popularity, awards and sales records with only limited releases. Businesswise, if I'm an investor or a fan, I see more room for growth with BlackPink. Just one more worldwide hit and they can be as big as BTS. ",

You don't compare the sky with the sea. Or like comparing one car against another. It's useless \u2014 you like what you like and that's it. However\u2026there's a big difference in how both are managed by their companies. Twice works like crazy shelling out album after album, always promoting and always performing. They constantly stay fresh in their fans' minds. Blackpink, on the other hand, made one album but performs A LOT. It's just that they have to perform the same list of songs all the time or sing covers. They stay busy onstage, doing endorsements and individual side gigs (Lisa's army show, Jennie's solo gig, etc) while fans are scratching their heads about when their next comeback will be. They are very different groups in every way. Twice is cute and bubbly while BP is more \u201cgirl crush\" and fiery. I like almost every BP song but can do without a few Twice tracks. That goes back to having more opportunities to reject Twice's music because they have so much to choose from. See? It goes back to management. So there you go \u2014 both teams are lucky enough to have top talents but there's a huge gap in style, membership types, tracklists and management. Take your pick. Or pick both because it's better that way. ",

I prefer BLACKPINK because of the small group concept, and the different styles of music that they\u2019ve explored (e.g. Playing with Fire EDM). I appreciate all of the members of BLACKPINK, and I feel that they all have good potential and talent, and that their voices are unique. I\u2019m just waiting for more of their songs to come out now. At the same time, I don\u2019t support the hate that TWICE has gotten, and I don\u2019t have anything against the members, it\u2019s just the music isn\u2019t my style. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I prefer twice. I still like blackpink but not anywhere near as much. If I compared vocals, twice has more better vocalists but considering their different styles blackpinks vocals are good too. Dance wise, I feel that twice is better. While blackpinks might seem harder, if you compare the hardest dance of the two and look at the dance practices, twice probably has harder choreography. This is especially evident if you look at twice\u2019s special stages and covers. Best dancers, I reckon momo is better than Lisa but they\u2019re both amazing. Concept wise, they\u2019re just different but since it\u2019s opinion, I like twice\u2019s concept more. They have various styles from being very cute to their most recent album which is completely different. Blackpink only really has one concept and style but it still works. Overall, blackpink has less good songs, less songs in general and has more popularity internationally for their style of music. I won\u2019t say much about personality comparison as I don\u2019t really know blackpink anywhere near as well as twice. Twice is better in my honest opinion and also, are probably more popular in Korea. ",

They\u2019re just occasionally throwing out Japanese music too. They released What is Love? recently too (such a good song) and they\u2019re already having their comeback next month I believe.

            "answer_text": "I want to say Blackpink because of their hit top-charted song \u201cDdududu\u201d and a collab song with Dua Lipa in \u201cKiss and make up\" which gained them million views on youtube. However soon after I discovered another k-pop girl group that is Twice I have to change my mind because I am attracted more to the personality and realness of the idols. Twice can create connection with the fans through their dorky and fun personalities while I couldn't connect myself with Blackpink. I think being in a k-pop group where they were trained as trainess for years resulted them with great talents in dancing, singing and performing abilities. No doubt each of them has great skills but personally I think Twice suits me best because I am not looking for better vocal, better looks or better dance and rap in group but I am looking for the music and idols that inspire me in life.

They are different to other girl groups, I don't know what it is\u2026 but they are just fantastic, Jisoo is my favorite especially\u2026 if there was a leader I'm sure she'd take place, but there isn't a leader so they're all amazing. Lisa as well is totally adorable you can tell she's the maknae\u2026 and Rose is so funny, Jennie is the quiet one to me.. sh doesn't say much and is m reserved in m opinion but they are all amazing ",

Very early impressions of the characters in the Band - Jeonghyon - Reminds me ( visually ) of a young Yossie . Obviously a very lively character and it would be interesting to see if she does sketch comedy well. MoMo - Knockout visually ( esp in the Cheer Up PV ) and a superb Dancer. The rest are still gelling but its early days. JYP scores again. ",

Twice\u2019s songs are mostly upbeat, lively and cute so thats why theyre so popular in Korea and Japan while BP\u2019s songs are mostly a bad-girl concept so it explains why theyre actually really popular internationally. Offstage, both groups don\u2019t really have much of a difference actually, theyre all dorky and fun when with their members and friendly towards their fans. Although I\u2019d say Twice is actually more relaxed onstage and brings out a cheerful vibe to the audience on stage since their songs are more catchy? ",

(not saying bp is lazy) I'm just saying facts 1st)every Twice comeback is a full album and 1 full albumn contains 10 songs and every songs needs a dance (imagine the amount of time and energy needed) but blackpink doesn't even have a full album untill now (this is yg problem) 2nd)Twice has been joining and participating every award shows and performance. Twice is also the most awarded kpop girl group. But blackpink has not been participating any award shows or variety shows (like isac, every kpop group would join but only bp won't) (this is yg problem) 3rd) Blackpink are seriously being models instead of idols (u can't deny, is true isn't it?) Conclusion : YG hobby is to waste blackpink talent and ruin them :) ",

Blackpink music are more addictive and that why they always become hit when relase a new single. Twice music are more pop and catchy. Eventhought Twice music are become more matured to most recent album. This make their music more variety. For the best conclusion if you ask who more famous here we go BLACKPINK. But if you wanna taste more Korean signature pop here we go TWICE NO BIAS ",

They both come from two of the Top 3 entertainment companies in South Korea. Twice from JYP, which also is home to groups such as GOT7, Miss A and the (now disbanded) Wonder Girls. BLACKPINK comes from Yg Entertainment, which is home to BIGBANG, 2NE1 (disbanded) and WINNER. Some of their members have friendships with each members from the other group, as I noticed in a few videos (BLACKPINK\u2019s Jennie\u2019s friendship with Twice\u2019s Nayeon). So if you are a Blink (like me!!) or a Once lets get along like the groups are. ",
