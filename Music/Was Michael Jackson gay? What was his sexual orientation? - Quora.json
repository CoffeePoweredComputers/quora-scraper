            "answer_text": "I could keep it short and say that he was heterosexual, but I've found an awesome piece of information with more details on that and it's pretty eye-opening. It's a letter from someone who was a long time employee of Michael Jackson. Read it: 2004-06-12 (at the time of the Arvizo's claims of molestation) You people are so gullible! I love it, it\u2019s hilarious. Anybody who genuinely knows Michael (which is none of you), knows that Michael is straight \u2013 almost to a fault of himself, considering that he doesn\u2019t look like the most masculine of brothas. You\u2019re so quick to believe Scott (he claimed to have a gay relationship with Michael), which is hysterical because if you knew their history, you\u2019d know how weirded out Michael was by Scott\u2019s advances. Michael\u2019s not overtly homophobic, but he is old school and isn\u2019t completely comfortable with it. However, given the nature of his profession, he has tried his best to be accepting and because he tries to be a good Christian, he does not judge, he leaves that to God. He still gets incredibly uncomfortable by advances by anything remotely male\u2026.which brings us to Scott. Scott made a pass at Michael. Michael ignored it, initially. The second time, Michael told him to back the f*ck off (in more polite language, of course\u2026Michael was still quite young and sweet and innocent back in the \u201980s, if a dude tried something similar NOW, he might get punched in the face). They haven\u2019t spoken since then. The closest he ever got to Michael after about \u201984 was that his boyfriend was friends with Priscilla Presley\u2019s makeup artist. The two haven\u2019t spoken since Scott tried to get all up on Mikey. One may ask themselves, if his motive for coming forward now was out of some sort of moral obligation and a desire to crush MJ\u2019s \u201cstrategy\u201d of declaring himself heterosexual, why didn\u2019t he come forward in 1993? Maids, cooks, ex-guards, everybody and their momma was coming forward with \u201cclaims,\u201d why not then? Or, if the motivation behind this is genuine concern for the welfare of children and not money, why not go to the police with the things you\u2019ve seen (i.e. Scott claiming to have seen child porn on Michael\u2019s nightstand)? Simple, none of it happened and Scott was still livin\u2019 the life with all of Liberace\u2019s dough. Poverty brings forth all sorts of \u201cmemories.\u201d Isn\u2019t it convenient that just as soon as his cash stash is running dry, he tells the world he had sex with Michael Jackson? Please. Let me break this down for you people and pay attention because I don\u2019t like doing it more than once. Michael Jackson is thoroughly heterosexual. He does not like men. He does not like boys. He likes women over the age of 18. Shiiiiit, even before he was 18, he liked women well over the age of 18. It\u2019s no secret within certain circles that Diana Ross was his first. The poor guy thought he was going to marry her but she fucked him over with Gene Simmons and Arne Naess. He was pretty naive back then, so he chose not to see the obvious. Then he was celibate for about 3 years, before becoming involved with a pretty, blond employee of his, an actress from a popular \u201980s/early \u201990s sitcom, a singer that nobody cares about anymore but was the sh*t back in the day, some groupie/secretary, June Chandler,the mother of punk bitch Jordan (the kid who accused Michael in 1993) who got jealous of mommy\u2019s relationship with Michael and, of course, Lisa Marie. Lisa Marie was the only one he allowed himself to become more than just sexually involved with since Diana, that boy was sprung. Lisa Marie, however, led him to believe they would have a family of their own, but stayed on the pill anyway because even if she said she was a rebel, the little bitch didn\u2019t want mommy dearest to get mad at her for having a lil black child. Mike found the pills, split, messed around with a couple of other women with the goal of getting one pregnant just to hurt Lisa (he can be an as.shole sometimes, true) and eventually knocked up Debbie, which, (if I didn\u2019t love and adore his children and think they saved his life) I would say was probably one of the biggest mistakes of his life. He was never faithful to Debbie after they married, never even wanted to marry her but Mike doesn\u2019t like to break his mother\u2019s heart. He and Lisa continued having sex until 1999 (they weren\u2019t \u201ctogether,\u201d they were just fucking), until he met his third child\u2019s mother, fell very much in love with her, but he is his father\u2019s son, so he wasn\u2019t entirely faithful to her, which is why they split up shortly after she found out she was pregnant. From that time, up until right before these new bullshit allegations broke, he was pretty much a dog. No attachment, just sex. He has no time to get attached to somebody and then depressed again after they part ways now that he has his children. I doubt he has time for anybody other than his children and his lawyers now. There, you have it. Take it or leave it, but it\u2019s the truth. Mike would hate me for putting his business out here like this, but at least it\u2019s accurate, unlike all of the other trash going around now. He ain\u2019t my boss anymore, so he\u2019s just going to have to put up with it. Summary: Scott is full of shit \u2014 Michael isn\u2019t gay and he sho\u2019 as hell ain\u2019t a pedophile. Well, I LOVE THIS LETTER. GOD BLESS THE ONE WHO HAD THE DECENCY TO COME FORWARD WITH THIS IN A TIME WHEN EVERYONE WAS READY TO SELL MICHAEL. THANK YOU. ",

            "answer_text": "Homosexual autohebephile, otherwise known as autoerotic or jokingly called SelfoSexual. Not everyone has a sexuality expressing itself only one way (especially if someone has had a traumatic childhood). There is a class of erotic identity disorders called paraphelias. MJ was attracted to the concept and image of himself as a pubescent boy. To confuse matters more, he also had sex with women and romanticized young boys.  A person's sexuality is NOT Just about sex. It's about identity, relationships, erotic attractions and love. Michael NEVER had a fulfilling long term relationship with a woman ( or another adult actually). He mistrusted females and therefore could not be emotionally intimate. He obsessed over unavailable women but quickly discarded available ones. He repeatedly asked uninterested women to marry him. He was the only celebrity who regularly went on publicity dates with both adult females and other people\u2019s children instead of real dates. This was a way to avoid the self disclosure necessary for emotional intimacy and bonding. Michael's big talent, one reason he had been called a prodigy, was for feigning emotions like love and romance on stage since he was a kid. His mother said he could convince you of things he did not know or feel. He found it easy to act but I don't think women were his priority. Having sex with them was easy, sharing his life, heart and soul with them was not. Michael was emotionally frozen in puberty. Everyone who knew him,knew that. When eroticism, identity and sexuality becomes stuck in that time, an erotic identity disorder can develop. Michael identified as pre pubescent and said so. He told us he was Peter Pan and meant it. He sacrificed his career and well being to continue this despite the devastation it brought him. He continued his romanticized friendships with boys (his reflections) despite legal, personal and career problems His erotic identity formed too early by being over exposed to adult sexuality at a very young age. He was considered a sex symbol before he hit puberty. On stage he was the focus of lust, and adoration while barely out of childhood. At some youthful stage his celebrity persona, empowered with so much charisma has become his erotic / sexual ideal. Not turning to anyone else, distrustful, misogynist, narcissistic , religious, yet adored and sexualized by MILLIONS, his erotic feelings become fixed on himself as a prepubescent boy. Self erotic. Auto erotic. An erotic identity disorder develops. But how to express this when you are emotionally immature and your sexuality disturbed and stunted?  He dressed his current favorite boys in replicas of his outfits and let them wear his clothes so he could look at them as mini -Michael . It was speculation that some of these boys, like Omer Bhatti, might actually be his sons as they so closely resembled MJ. But that is the point, they resembled him. Jackson saw himself there ,as a charismatic boy, and that is what he liked. Jackson engaged with them emotionally, traveled with,lived with, shared with, bonded with them as one would ordinarily do a lover. He was never able to bond and share life with a woman, or an adult male for that matter. Michael spent 367 consecutive days and nights living with 12 year old Jonathan Spence which is longer than he ever lived with any adult except his mother. Omer Bhatti lived with Michael at Neverland for many years. Omer\u2019s parents lived in the employee quarters while Omer spent the majority of his time living in Michael\u2019s house, calling Michael \u201cDad\u201d. Again, it means he was attracted to himself living as a prepubescent boy and being with these boys was the expression of that. Remaining a boy was a desirable, attractive trait he saw in himself , he often said so. He had more preoccupation for his \u201d boyness\u201d than can be explained by a \u201c lost childhood\u201d. Boyhood was a fixation and identity fused with his adult sexuality. His home had literally millions of dollars worth of toys,dolls, super heroes figures, arcade machines,mannequins and a significant amount of it being in his private space for his personal use. He had an extensive personal collection of objects with his image, everything from fine art to figurines to posters. Everywhere Jackson looked there was an idealized, often eroticized image of himself. It was no accidental creative impulse that MJ\u2019s trademark year after year was grabbing his genitals on stage. Mj was a perfectionist who choreographed and planned every move. It\u2019s no spontaneous gesture that he wanted us to look at him there. The infamous gold pants were also no accident. He was meticulous in his costume design choices. He knew he sometimes got erections on stage in front of tens of thousands of fans and those gold pants made him feel powerful and erotic. HENCE: HOMOSEXUAL ( same gender as yourself as sexually attractive) AUTO HEBAPHELIA. (Yourself as erotic object , auto erotic ) IN OTHER WORDS, AN EROTIC PREFERENCE FOR YOURSELF in some other expression of yourself, a pubescent boy for example.  You don\u2019t have to have a healthy self esteem to be auto erotic. You can loathe yourself and still have this disorder. Michael said in conversation with Rabbi Schmully that for him \u201copposites don't attract\u201d He said \u201cwomen trap you with what's between their legs and then you\u2019re done, like my brothers and their wives\u201d Yes, he really said that. He couldn\u2019t feel the flip side which was, that his brothers were in love with, shared a life and children with their wives while Michael holed up at Neverland with Mini-me 12 year old boys as companions. Michael was preoccupied with himself as forever a boy, like Peter Pan. He found this to be attractive and often said as much. He said this and lived his life like this, I did not get this info from tabloids, which is the default insult for those who disagree. Michael Jackson was a man/ child but he was also an adult with a sexual identity.
