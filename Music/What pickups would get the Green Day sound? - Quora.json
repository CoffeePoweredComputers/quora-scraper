But more than likely their \u201csignature sound\u201d is probably leaning toward an angled Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB in the bridge position. Most passive humbuckers would get you pretty damn close. You\u2019re going to want to dial in your sound with the right amp. Armstrong has relied heavily on a modified Marshall, so it\u2019s anything but an off-the-shelf amp\u2019s sound. On the other hand he\u2019s also used a Fender Bassman, so\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Seymour Duncan JB for early Green Day, and Gibson P90 for later Green Day. The amp matters, too. In the studio, Billie Joe Armstrong uses a cranked Fender Tweed Deluxe amplifier if I remember correctly. Think the tone of \u2018American Idiot\u2019 for the P90 + tweed Deluxe sound. If the guitar you\u2019re playing on is routed for humbuckers, you can always install a Phat Cat or similar humbucker-sized P90 pickup and likely get a similar tone. ",
