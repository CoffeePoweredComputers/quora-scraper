            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to offer a different take. Songs like Helter Skelter and I\u2019m Down just prove that Paul was a rocker. We know that, nothing unusual there. All the Beatles were fundamentally rockers. Carnival of Light (which I\u2019ve never heard and never met anyone who has heard) and Wild Honey Pie show that he\u2019s experimental. But it\u2019s widely known that he was at least as experimental as John. He also regularly offered songs with orchestrations, from Yesterday to Eleanor Rigby to She\u2019s Leaving Home to Golden Slumbers. Paul wrote upbeat songs, rockers, ballads, experimental. But he hardly ever wrote mournful, hopeless songs. He\u2019s just not that sort. Except For No One. About as down as you can get, no sign of hope. She\u2019s gone, love is dead, life is lousy. Eleanor Rigby and She\u2019s Leaving Home are also downer songs, but they are sad stories about someone else. For No One is (or at least sounds) personal, and that, to me, makes it the most surprising \u201cPaul\u201d Beatles song. ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to Paul\u2019s songwriting nothing he comes up with is a surprise at least for me. Paul has such a wide range as a songwriter and can write just about anything he puts his mind and pen to. Got To Get You Into My Life from the Revolver album was the first song that I said, Well now that\u2019s something different. The horn section of that song was fantastic and it didn\u2019t sound like a typical Beatles song. I guess the White album was the most diverse album the Beatles ever put out and the songs on it run the gambit especially for McCartney from the sweet and tender like I Will to the harder edge songs like Birthday and Helter Skelter. For me I was a bit surprised by Golden Slumbers off Abbey Road. It was almost like opera in nature and just a beautiful song complete with a symphony. In truth considering the talent how could any song he writes be a surprise? Now George on the other hand his writing surprised me. ",
