            "answer_text": "John was an interesting guy. He developed his music with a group that worked hard and hit it really big. He wrote many great tunes that are now classics of pop in general, as well as many lesser known gems that were innovative, clever and often ahead of their time. As a singer and personality, he delivered powerfully and creatively and was a leading figure on the vanguard of the era\u2019s exciting and worldwide social changes. It\u2019s hard to imagine such a thing given today\u2019s somewhat lame, bland. fractured, unfocused and nothing in common corporate run media and it\u2019s sadly intellectually downhill headed society. Many of Lennon\u2019s songs were musically complex , well crafted, and interesting as well as put forth convincingly to the masses, and he definitely had a way with words and wasn\u2019t afraid to illustrate his deeper fears, insecurities, and sometimes tortured emotions in a poetic way. Like most great artists, he had a unique, soulful and razor sharp mind and he aimed high, dug deeply, and in his case had the freedom to take creative risks that the Beatles vast popularity allowed - knowing his tunes would be heard by millions with every release.
