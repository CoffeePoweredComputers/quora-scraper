            "answer_text": "You can join any good dance class for start and if you are not able to join any class in your area,  you can start learning from youtube videos and other videos. But first you have to make you body strong and stretchable by doing exercise.  1. Prepare your daily routine chart because a good dancer needs good maintenance.  2. For the 1st week only do exercise and take healthy foods only because your body needs to adapt the new life style.  3. Then if you have any relative in your contact then dare (as you are afraid of being pranked I think so because you questioned ANONYMOUSLY) and ask him/her about dance learning.  4. Then search for the BEGINNERS dance learning video and start learning.  All the best ",

            "answer_text": "Why asking as anonymous? Best is to join a good dance academy. Depending on style of dance you'll need to join the corresponding academy. Or find an academy that teaches a little bit of everything for starters at least. Your question lacks any sort of detail other than your age and urge to learn dance. I'd suggest you to add further details to the question so that people can give you useful advice for your situation or interest. ",
