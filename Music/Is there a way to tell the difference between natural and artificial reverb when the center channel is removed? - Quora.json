            "answer_text": "There are so many different kinds of artificial reverbs which makes it hard to give a single answer to this question. But basically if you put in the time to make the artificial reverb sound as natural as possible then you can never tell the difference unless your the person who actually put the artificial reverb on it. But many reverbs will always sound artificial even if you remove the center channel. The qualities you want to listen for when pointing out artificial reverb are things like the following: - Is the reverb too loud for what is being played? - Could the instrument produce that kind of reverb in the space of wherever it was recorded? - Does the reverb cut off randomly or trail on too long? - Are there weird digital artifacts in the reverb? - Is the reverb on one instrument different than the reverb on another? Multiple yes's would lead me to think the reverb is artificial. If the reverb is natural then you probably won't even notice it's there, unless the song was recorded in an empty parking garage or in a cave or something like that. ",

            "answer_text": "If you hear some reverb on a modern recorded vocal it's almost definately an artificial reverb (talking about popular music here, wouldn't be true of all genres, classical for example). It's just the standard today to record the vocal in a very dead \"booth\" then add a reverb effect afterwards.  What you are hearing are just different types of reverb. Short reverbs do tend to be louder. These have a lot of \"early reflections\" which die away quickly so they need to be mixed louder.  A long reverb tail may well sound like it is delayed slightly if you remove the dry vocal in the center channel. Sound only travels at 340m/s which roughly translates as 1 ms per foot.  Let's say you are modelling a 50ft room with a digital reverb. By the time the source sound has just got from the source to the back wall and back to the source that's 50ft to get there, 50ft to get back so 100ms (approx). That's just the first reflection. It also will bounce a few times off different surfaces which is what we hear as a reverb trail. Just by the speed of sound and the size of the room this all takes a little bit of time and when you remove the dry signal it may sound like a slight delay.  ",
