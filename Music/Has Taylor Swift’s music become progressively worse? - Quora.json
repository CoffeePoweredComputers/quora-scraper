            "answer_text": "I think her music has gotten worse. She seems more interested in appealing to her strongest fan base (young girls) who seem more interested in music with beats, layered keyboards, programmed drums & multi vocal tracks (all usually produced by 1 or 2 people) over songs performed by actual musicians. She now seems more comfortable performing with 3 or 4 female dancers (lip-syncing in the process) rather than performing with 3 or 4 actual musicians. Dancing, choreography, production and costumes seem to be really important to her younger fans these days. I have no issue with her conversion from country to pop to more studio based creations, but the actual songs on her first five L.P.\u2019s are IMO stronger than her more recent offerings. Remember, \u201cFearless\u201d & \u201c1989\u201d both won the Album Of The Year at The Grammys. \u201cRed\u201d was nominated, but lost to Daft Punk. Huh? I first learned of Taylor Swift around the time when \u201cRed\u201d (her 4th studio album) came out and her songs would pop up on the radio station that played where i worked. While I thought virtually everything else the station played, that was current, sucked, I liked everything I heard by her and went out and purchased all of her albums. I should point out I was in my mid fifties at the time. She had a great band, good songs, good production\u2026 what\u2019s not to like? Things changed with her 5th L.P. \u201c1989\u201d. The songs were still pretty good, but the band/Live musician aspect was gone. The studio only creations became more noticeable on the \u201cRed\u201d L.P., but band performances were still there. Her last two L.P.\u2019s (\u201dreputation\u201d & \u201cLover\u201d) have continued this trend where \u201cdrum programming\u201d is credited on virtually every track. Sure, songs like \u201cNew Years Day\u201d, \u201cLover\u201d, \u201cSoon You\u2019ll Get Better\u201d and \u201cBetter Man\u201d occasionally come along with an actual piano or guitar, but they\u2019re becoming less frequent. But, alas\u2026 that\u2019s the state of radio friendly music today. Also, I do wish she\u2019d stop using the standard C-Am-F-G progression in so many songs (listen to ME!). Still a fan. ",

She is almost 30, and clearly got bored with being solely country a long, long time ago. Don\u2019t forget that she is first and foremost a songwriter, so she is in more of a position than most to explore influences beyond what first made her famous; it doesn\u2019t hurt that she is very, very good at it and therefore has been hugely successful. She hasn\u2019t lost her way because she\u2019s the one defining which way her way is. ",

So for a country / strong lyrics fan, her first albums will always surpass the likes of reputation and 1989 but recent releases like Lover bring back in a few tracks the kind of lyrics we love from her. But for a heavy pop fan base, each new music she puts out is a step up from the previous. ",
