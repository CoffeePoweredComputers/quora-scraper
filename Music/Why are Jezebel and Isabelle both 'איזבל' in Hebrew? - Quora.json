            "answer_text": "The original name is Izevel or Izavel, the daughter of the Sidonite king Itba\u2019al and the wife of Israelite king Ahab. Another name from the bible is Elisheva. This name is translated in English as Elisabeth and in French as Isabelle. The English translation of the name Izevel is Jezebel since many Hebrew words with \u201cI\u201d or \u201cY\u201d sounds are translated into \u201cJ\u201d sound. For example, Emeq Yizra\u2019el is translated to \u201cJezreel Valley\u201d, and \u201cYehoshua\u201d or \u201cYossef\u201d are translated to \u201cJoshua\u201d and \u201cJoseph\u201d. My favorite is how Yerushalem, the older name for Yerushalayim, is translated to Jerusalem. In Hebrew, \u05d0\u05d9\u05d6\u05d1\u05dc can mean both Izevel/Izavel (i.e. Jezebel) and Izabel (i.e. Isabelle). Today the name Izevel is rarely used while Izabel is a well-known name. Most of the times when you see \u05d0\u05d9\u05d6\u05d1\u05dc, unless it refers to the biblical character, it refers to the French translation of Elisabeth (i.e. Elisheva of the Hebrew bible). ",
