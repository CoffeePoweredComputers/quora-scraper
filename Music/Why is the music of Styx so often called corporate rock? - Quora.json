            "answer_text": "I\u2019d offer a slightly different spin\u2026didn\u2019t read the book but one could take this as a profound desire to make sure they put out a quality \u201cproduct\u201d. So, corporate could mean that the band (or their record company) is maintaining quality control. In thinking about this, from album 1 with Tommy (Crystal Ball) through Kilroy, every album is good\u2014-count on it! Most bands can\u2019t and don\u2019t keep that up\u2014-there\u2019s a throwaway in there somewhere. Not them. (and yes, I know, many would not consider Kilroy quality, which may be why it was the end of Styx with the golden years line-up\u2014and Kilroy has Just Get Through This Night and Havent We Been Here Before, two of my absolute favs) One final thought: that Styx vocal harmony, perfected beyond perfection on Grand Illusion could be described as their signature. You hear that and you immediately know it\u2019s Styx. Just like you know when you here \u201cba da ba ba ba, I\u2019m loving it\u201d that it\u2019s McDonald\u2019s. You have, at that point, a successful brand, or corporation if you will. To sum, yeah most artists and fans would view the corporate tag as a negative. But, to steal from Tommy in \u201cHavent we\u2026\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s not necessarily so\u2026\u201d Quick Note: Music is indeed a business, like it or not. Not too surprising that they themselves or the record company would sell or market them. All bands are marketed to the masses\u2026so the question is, is Styx more \u201cguilty\u201d of this or do more of it than other bands. Also, I don\u2019t find people going ahead of gigs to make sure things run smoothly that unusual either. Most bands have people whose sole job is to do just that as part of their entourage. My college hosted Howard Jones my senior year, and he had all sorts of people arriving ahead of him\u2014I personally (as stated in his contract) escorted his personal chef to the local market, well before he himself arrived.

            "answer_text": "A lot of the bands who were labeled \u201ccorporate rock\u201d were also referred to \u201cfaceless\u201d bands. These bands were accused of making rock music purely for the money (corporately) & the faceless term came from the notion that bands like Styx, Foreigner, Kansas, Survivor, & Reo Speedwagon among others were comprised of band members who no one would know if they bumped into them on the street unless the artist gave them their name unlike bands like The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Queen, etc. who when people see them they immediately know who they are by sight. Another thing these type of bands are accused of is making music that is very \u201csafe\u201d to listen to & always follows a pattern that is never deviated from. This isn\u2019t really a fair accusation because there are other bands not considered corporate or \u201cfaceless\u201d who always sound the same from album to album. Think AC/DC, ZZ Top, & George Thorogood & The Destroyers. Whatever these bands like Styx, Foreigner, etc. are labeled as it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact most of these bands have been very successful. ",
