            "answer_text": "You have a band but so do hundreds of other people. There\u2019s only one measure for success; a dying business model people still put a phony value on as we speak. That\u2019s the whole big label, big contract thing. Every band on the planet would love to have that contract but what they don\u2019t understand is that you have to have something that stands out and, on a long enough timeline, it\u2019s going to become irrelevant unless you do something groundbreaking. That \u201csomething groundbreaking\u201d\u2026yeah, fuck your definition of it because, unless it is something that generates obscene amounts of goddamn cash, it\u2019s not \u201csomething groundbreaking.\u201d This is why the music industry is kinda dying at the moment. Actually, it\u2019s kinda lingering in some hideous proto-life on life support. Put simply, it\u2019s the way it is because labels have become overinflated, sorta like movie studios. You have only two types; Fucking Colossal Gargantuan Behemoths that only want to get bigger and indie labels. Fact is, some indie labels might have far better music than the Behemoths but some of us will never know that because the indies may never really get any airplay and, should they manage that minor miracle, they\u2019ll never get to heavy rotation. It\u2019s a network. You\u2019re either in it or you\u2019re not. There\u2019s a whole lotta legalese in there too to keep people\u2019s asses covered. Guess who doesn\u2019t have the coverage necessary? You do. You make cents off of your albums and you will make most of your money from merchandising and ticket sales from concerts. The bigger the turnout, the more you will make. The more you make, the more music you will probably need to churn out to support another tour and hope like shit you have the budget to make all the dates. It\u2019s the structure of it coupled by attorneys who are basically serving two masters here. First, you have to keep everything legal. All money has to be accounted for in order to make sure everything is on the up and up with taxes. Second, you have to ensure your corporate overlords get paid and paid comfortably. Then there\u2019s the X-Factor; The fact that the music business (much like everything in the entire entertainment industry) is a huge gamble. Let\u2019s say that you have a contract, finally. You scored that ever-elusive key to the door of your dreams. You had better be very entertaining. You better come up with something original on the regular. Because if you don\u2019t and that gamble taken on your doesn\u2019t net huge returns, you could be released from that contract. Remember, the attorneys will work for the company, not you. Switch roles. If you\u2019ve just dumped about a few million into a band and it\u2019s not paying off, what would you do? That\u2019s why it\u2019s so cut throat. ",
