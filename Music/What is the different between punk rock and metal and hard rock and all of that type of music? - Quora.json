            "answer_text": "Okey dokey, here we go, time to clear up some misconceptions.  I'm going to start by defining the genres that you have named, and giving you a brief history of them:  Hard RockLess of a specific genre and more of a loosely used term.  Generally it is used to refer to the heavier blues-rock bands of the late '60's, and early '70's, and is sometimes applied bands who are in the vein from other time periods.  However, as I said before, this is a loosely used term, and its meaning really depends on who's using it, and the context in which it was used. Here is are some examples of what someone might call Hard Rock:Led Zeppelin - When the Levee BreaksIron Butterfly - In-A-Gadda-Da-VitaVanilla Fudge - You Keep Me Hangin' On A More Modern Example:The White Stripes - Catch Hell Blues A non-bluesy song that someone may call Hard Rock:Blue Oyster Cult - Don't Fear the Reaper Heavy MetalA heavier kind of music that grew out of Hard Rock.  The big three of early Heavy Metal are often thought to be Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, but the genre was also very influenced by Metallica, Death, and Dream Theater later on.  The genre is often very musically advanced, featuring very technically difficult solos, and riffs, and may have very complex songs which are put together meticulously. Here are some examples of early or influential Heavy Metal:Black Sabbath - Sabbath Bloody SabbathDeep Purple - Smoke on the WaterMetallica - One (As Mentioned Above under Hard Rock):Led Zeppelin - When the Levee BreaksBlue Oyster Cult - Don't Fear the Reaper Here's some More Modern Heavy Metal:Animals As Leaders - The Price of Everything and The Value of NothingMudvayne - Happy Punk RockPunk is a genre of rock which evolved in the '70's which put an emphasis (at least initially) on simplicity (most Punk Rockers were encouraged to not be able to play their instrument) and anti-establishment rebelliousness.  It was very much developed in opposition to Progressive Rock (a popular genre at the time which put an emphasis on complexity in music, ie Pink Floyd, Gentle Giant, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, etc.)  The scene originally evolved in NYC as an underground occurrence, but soon caught on in Britain, where an economic recession made rebelliousness very attractive to a lot of people.  Later on it evolved to include a wider array of musical influences including art punk (which ironically mixed progressive rock and punk rock) or Hardcore punk (which mixed metal and punk). Here are some early Punkers:The Ramones - Blitzkrieg BopSex Pistols - God Save the QueenThe Clash - I Fought the Law Here are some slightly later Punkers after the style started to evolve:The Clash - London Calling (notice the evolution between \"I Fought the Law\" and \"London Calling\", and \"London Calling\"'s mixed influences, ie Reggae).Television - Marquess Moon (Art Punk)Black Flag - TV Party (Hardcore Punk) Here are some modern Punkers now that the genre has become much more evolved and diverse:The Strokes - Last NiteThe White Stripes - Seven Nation Army Okay, now let's try some comparisons: Hard Rock vs. Heavy MetalHeavy Metal evolved out of Hard Rock as I said before, so honestly Heavy Metal owes a lot to Hard Rock, however, modern Heavy Metal has very little blues in it (with the exception of some bands that purposefully put blues into their metal, ie Pantera) whereas Hard Rock tends to be very blues based.  Also, Heavy Metal tends to be much more meticulously put together, involving a much more careful musical structure whereas Hard Rock tends to be a little more improv based/jammy (these are generally rules,  but there are some jammy metal bands, and some meticulous hard rock bands). Try listening to these back to back:Led Zeppelin - When the Levee BreaksDream Theater -  The Enemy Inside They are contrasted by Zeppelin's bluesy feel vs. Dream Theater's very complex, planned out feel.  On the other hand, listen to the two vocalists.  DT's vocalist (Labrie) takes a lot after Zeppelin's vocalist (Plant). Hard Rock vs. Punk RockPunk Rock's general guitar style was mostly influenced by Johnny Ramone, the guitarist for The Ramones.  He developed his signature style of guitar playing by trying the copy Jimmy Page's guitar on \"Communication Breakdown\" by Led Zeppelin.  However, Ramone (who doesn't really play guitar beyond the Ramones; I'm not hating, he's said that in interviews) didn't really have the talent to play like Page (who's arguably one of the best rock guitarists of all time), and so Ramone's style is really a simplified version of \"Communication Breakdown\"'s guitar. Try listening to these back to back:Led Zeppelin - Communication BreakdownThe Ramones - Blitzkrieg Bop This kind of encapsulates the difference between Hard Rock and early Punk Rock.  Hard Rock was about the music, Punk Rock was about the message and the music was incidental, meaning that, not only did Punk Rockers generally not play well, but they even resented or made fun of rock musicians who did play well.  For example, despite the undeniable influence of Zeppelin on the Punk Rock movement, when Punk became big a lot of Punkers refused to listen to Zeppelin because they viewed Zeppelin as being too good at music, or too complex, and thus somewhat pretentious. Punk Rock vs. Heavy MetalWow.  I cannot stress this enough.  Most Metal stars and early Punk stars would HATE each other.  They would just HATE HATE HATE each other.  A lot of metal is about who can play the fastest solo, who can write the most complex song, etc. whereas, as I said before punk rockers hated that.  Although there's some intersection between the two genres (Black Flag and the Hardcore Punk scene, and more recently the Metalcore/Deathcore movements) this has mostly come from the widening of the Punk mentality to include other musical influences that I mentioned before.  However early Punk and Heavy Metal just would not have, and did not get along. Try listening to these:Dream Theater - The Enemy InsideThe Ramones - Blitzkrieg Bop ... Yea, you see it now, right? One last thing:ScreamoScreamo is a pejorative term used mostly to refer to types of Extreme Metal (Thrash, Death, Black, and Doom Metal) in which the vocalist growls, shrieks, or screams.  This might not be your thing, but please don't call them screamo.  Like I said before, metal musicians put a lot of work into their music, and even if you don't like them, they deserve your respect. Here are some examples:Gojira - L'Enfant Sauvage (Death Metal)Ihsahn - Arrival (Black Metal)Mastodon - TrilobiteThe Devin Townsend Project - Juular ConclusionWell holy shit I wrote a lot.  If you try checking out all the songs I recommended... or even bothered reading this whole answer, you will probably have an excellent grasp on the differences between these genres.  I really recommend you try listening to some more Hard Rock or Heavy Metal.  It's best to try to ease yourself into it at first if you're queasy about it, for example, start by listening to Black Sabbath, and then try moving up to Metallica, Dream Theater, Animals as Leaders, etc.  Then maybe try to get into Death, Gojira, Devin Townsend, and the other heavier stuff. P.S. Just saying it again: Like it or not, please don't call it Screamo. ",

            "answer_text": "Punk rock, hard rock and heavy metal all comes under the genre of Rock music. However there are significant differences between them, Hard Rock: Hard rock emerged in the mid \u201960s after the massive experimentation of heavy distortions by following the genres like - garage rock or surf rock. There is a debate about who is the first hard rock band. Most people come to the conclusion that Kink\u2019s You Really Got Me\u2019s power chorded riffs was the first ever hard rock.  The next year, Rolling Stone\u2019s (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction and Who\u2019s My Generation became a symbolic song for hard rock,   But nevertheless hard rock was shaped by prominent blues bands like Led Zeppelin or Blue Cheer or Steppenwolf.  (Led Zeppelin) Hard rock bands went further to their roots, blues and collaborated with blues and modern rock (of that time) as resulted hard rock. Jimmy Page himself experimented with different styles and techniques. Punk Rock: Punk Rock was also the result of garage rock which emerged in early \u201860s. However unlike hard rock, punk rock musicians were less skilled, or to more precisely showed less attention to lead instruments and focused their attention on rhythm instruments. As I mentioned many times that I believe the band Sonics was probably the first punk rock band.  But anyway, the true punk emerged when artists like Iggy Pop or MC5 focused on really heavy, loud sound.  (Iggy Pop) The lyrical theme was about politics and society. Which got more aggressive in mid \u201970s like bands of Ramones and Sex Pistols.  It can be noted that punk rock was heavily inspired by hard rock. For instance, Johnny Ramone states that his primary inspiration for downpicking came from Jimmy Page\u2019s Communication Breakdown. Heavy Metal: Heavy metal was also emerged through hard rock. But unlike hard rock theme - heavy metal dealt with more serious stuffs like occultism or witchcraft. Generally when considering the first metal band, people divide into two groups,  The majority of the people go with Black Sabbath. Minority people go with Deep Purple. Black Sabbath had dark lyrics and slow paced power chorded heavy riffs. They were a slow heavy blues bands. But Deep Purple unlike them, their lyrical stuff was cheesy but music was very fast. They extracted the classical music form and collaborated with hard rock. Resulting fastest solos which you see in most metal solos. So, its not right to deny that one is the metal band while the other one is not. Later musicians - bands like Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, both of them were heavily inspired by them. Now the differences, Punk Rock vs Heavy Metal You could see that Punk rock is loud while the heavy metal have a thicker (heavier) sound. Minor scales have been using for heavy metal riffs since the beginning. Hard Rock vs Heavy Metal There you go. Although for the primary heavy metal bands the sound seemed like hard rock but heavy metal are now very different from hard rock music. Hard rock songs are often based on pentathlon blues while metal worked between different classical scales such as - such as harmonic minor scale. If you want to know the difference between hard rock and heavy metal by hearing, then, hard rock sounds more bluesy while heavy metal sounds thicker/warmer/faster than hard rock. Hard Rock vs PunkIf you\u2019ve understood the difference between punk rock vs heavy metal and heavy metal vs hard rock, then you\u2019d easily understand the difference between hard rock vs punk rock. Punk rock sounds louder than hard rock and often followed by repetitive rhythms such as - downpicking while hard rock sounds less louder but heavier than punk rock and has more technical styles of playing. Another thing to notice is that punk rock songs are faster than hard rock songs. ",
