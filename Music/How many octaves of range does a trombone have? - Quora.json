            "answer_text": "This depends entirely on the player and the passage in question. In my warmup, I can go from double pedal B flat (lowest B flat on the piano) up to B flat an octave and a 7th higher than middle C, which is five octaves (six different B flats). But don\u2019t ask me to pop out one of those extreme notes under any circumstances whatsoever! The highest note required in standard classical orchestra repertoire is the F an octave and a 4th above middle C, in Beethoven\u2019s 5th symphony. Frankly, it gives players nightmares. The lowest that I have normally seen for a tenor trombone is pedal B flat, two octaves and a note below middle C, in Berlioz\u2019 March to the Scaffold. Bass trombone is routinely asked to go lower than that. I personally have had to play a written double pedal B flat, which is my lowest note that I can depend on, and I went into training so it would be reliable. However, I get the impression that you are writing trombone parts and want to stay inside playable ranges. This depends on the experience of the player you are writing for. This is a reasonable guide. Basic would be about grade 8 or so. Grade 10 for Intermediate. The first trombonist in the senior band in Grade 12 should be able to touch the Advanced high B flat if it doesn\u2019t last too long, and this is a nice conservative range for professionals as well. The extended range is for strong university players and professionals on special occasions, and only for very short passages.  ",

However, if I\u2019ve learned one thing in 40+ years of trombone playing, it\u2019s that as soon as you state some normal range of the trombone, someone will pop up to shoot that down and insist any real trombone player can play from ___ to ___ and\u2026 can\u2019t everyone?
