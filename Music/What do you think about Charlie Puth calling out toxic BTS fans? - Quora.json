            "answer_text": "I saw it coming tbh. Toxic ARMYs are plenty in numbers and stan twitter is a hotbed for the worst parts of fandoms in general. (I'm aware that the controversy arose from tiktok, but stan twitter armchairs need to be held accountable.) Not every idol uses bts for clout, and honestly? I doubt BTS is interested in being friends with all the mainstream musicians there, so what exactly are you trying to do here? Actually that brings us to the main problem: there's a prominent \u201cbts need to be protected, the whole world is out against them\u201d attitude, and honestly, the fandom needs to chill. BTS are veterans in the industry now, they know exactly what they're dealing with, and if they don't, their company does. And Charlie Puth didn't even mention armys directly; he talked about all fandoms and how they should think before saying nasty things, because words do hurt, and we've all seen it's consequences play out tragically.

He should have been more critical than he was. Every western artist who has collaborated with members or the group has been accused of clout chasing by Koreaboos who know nothing. The group wants to thank these tantrum throwing brats for ensuring that no artist, western or Asian, will work with them in the future. ",
