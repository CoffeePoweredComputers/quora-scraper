            "answer_text": "~YG is absolute crap\u2026.but he\u2019s smart. Now you might ask smart? Smart as in? How is he smart? But he is, he knows how to capture an audience. Think about it for a sec. Why is so many of his groups popular even though he doesn\u2019t really maintain them well. Because he is smart and he knows business. Take Blackpink for example, it\u2019s been three years since they debuted but they don\u2019t have many songs, much to the displeasure of the fans. But still with the lack of songs, he still manages to keep the audience entrapped in a way. How? Well they have a lot of modeling gigs, there\u2019s their tour, merch, and lots of stuff. YG knows how to make money, he knows how to make profit. Even with all those scandals and controversies, he still manages to stay on top, which is a bit shocking. But he knows the game and he knows how to play it. This answer might not make much sense haha but this is my opinion, you are free to disagree. Until next time, Byeeeeeeeeeeeee ~El ",

            "answer_text": "Any news released from YG entertainment (and every other Korean gossip/news, that is) I take with a grain of salt. YG often sent a notice before their artist are making a \u201cdebut/comeback\u201d. Its almost always late. A fairytale I still remember : \u201cBlackpink will debut with 2 songs per months for three months\u201d or something like that. Black Pink actually debuted with two songs on August 2016. They kept the promise for the first month. It has been 11 months since and Blackpink released a total of 5 songs. Boom. In comparison, JYP said that Day6 will release songs monthly in 2017. It has been keeping it promise for six months now and the band had been releasing two excellent songs per month. Well, I never let myself get excited unless the music video had actually out on Youtube. ",
