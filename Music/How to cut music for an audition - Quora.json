            "answer_text": "When making the cut, look for the following: The 32 bars have to make musical sense. That is, whatever it is you sing should sound as complete as possible.Find the part of the song that shows off the best part of your vocal capabilities: your range (showing the highest and lowest notes in the song), your tone, ability to sing rapid passages, ability to show emotion/interpretive abilities, etc. This may mean your cut will start somewhere other than the beginning of the song. That\u2019s okay as long as the cut meets the requirement in the first bullet point.Do not include parts of the song that you are not confident you can sing well. If there is a high note that you have problems with for example, don\u2019t sing it. The audition will be stressful enough without having to worry about whether or not you\u2019ll be able to sing it or not. Sing only the portion of the song you can do well.For an intro, try not to use more than one or two bars for that. Include just the bare minimum you\u2019ll need in order to get enough of a cue-one bar of intro ( usually four beats for musical theater) should be plenty for preparation.32 bars for most musical theater songs is more than enough music to be able to meet the above. If you are having difficulty finding a section in the song you wish to use, then find another song. There are also books where the cuts are done for you\u2014look through those as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether singing 16 or 32 bars, or a full song, you want to tell a story, however brief, and show off your best notes. Usually a quick rule of thumb is to start at the end of a song where the big finish notes usually are and count backwards, finding a good clean starting point. It\u2019s better to err on the side of slightly fewer bars if you are asked to sing 32, than sing more than requested and risk getting cut off. If you honor the requirements put forth, you will usually get to finish your piece. But always leave those you are auditioning for wanting more and they can ask for a second piece (which you should always have prepared as well). And make sure that you rehearse any new pieces including any cuts with a good pianist\u2014NEVER go into an audition and sing a new song or cut in the actual audition room for the first time. And if you are lucky, a good accompanist will usually help you to mark up your music, making it very clear where to stop and start for the audition pianist. Break a leg! ",
