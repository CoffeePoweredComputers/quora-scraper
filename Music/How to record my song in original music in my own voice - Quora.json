It is a fairly cheap one. You can also find one on sale. MRP Rs. 5999.00 (probably).   This particular process is very helpful. Do check it out. There are other options available. You can use your mobile as well. However this is much higher quality. I would recommend it for original music. Thanks Message me if you have queries ",
