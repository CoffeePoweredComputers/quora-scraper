            "answer_text": "Depends on the type of horror you like. Personally I don't like slasher/gore; when Halloween came out, ushering in the slasher movies, I was turned off (to this day I've never seen the full Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nighmare on Elm Street- though I did see Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the mid-2000s.- it just made me sad) and I grew up on horror movies: Dracula, Zombies, Demons, etc. Today I prefer thrillers and movies that chill (ghost stories are fun)- oh, and of course those old Hammer Horror movies. Identify the genre you prefer then ask. There are thousands of titles. ",
