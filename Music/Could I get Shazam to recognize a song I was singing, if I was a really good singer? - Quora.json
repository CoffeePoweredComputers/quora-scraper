            "answer_text": "No. Shazam can only identify prerecorded music. When you hit shazam, it creates an acoustic fingerprint based on what the microphone is recording. If the fingerprint matches one in their data base, they've successfully identified the song. However, since your singing is not in their database, they will not be able to recognize what song it is. In order for them to identify what song you're singing, you'd need to have the exact vocals with the exact background music at the exact tempo that the original song is at. Cheers! ",
