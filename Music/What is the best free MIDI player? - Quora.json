            "answer_text": "In general, there isn\u2019t a singular best MIDI player application; the vast majority of media player applications for desktop operating systems handle MIDI files the same. If your favorite music player app plays .mid files, then for you, that\u2019s the best MIDI player. That said\u2026 at least for Windows, the built-in MIDI playback support that all of these programs use? It\u2019s junk. It uses a severely compressed soundfont licensed from Roland; the original files were good, but Windows\u2019 version isn\u2019t worthwhile. I\u2019d suggest installing VirtualMIDISynth and the related MIDI Mapper, along with a good soundfont like FluidR3, OmegaGMGS2, and/or Fatboy, and disabling the Windows-built-in synth in Device Manager.(Note that some applications occasionally have problems; right now, for me, Media Player Classic won\u2019t work with VMS, though it has in the past. But Windows Media Player, which had problems in the past, works fine now. Winamp works too\u2026 if you still use that.) ",

            "answer_text": "That question doesn\u2019t make any sense. MIDI is a method of communication between electronic instruments (hardware or software). There\u2019s no such thing as sound in MIDI, only things like pitch, velocity, key pressure, note on/off etc.Sound is then generated by the instrument based on the MIDI parameters. So a MIDI \u201cplayer\u201d isn\u2019t something that exists. You can feed MIDI to any instrument, depending on the sound you want. If your question is \u201cwhat is the best free MIDI-compatible instrument\u201d then that\u2019s a whole different question, that doesn\u2019t have any specific answer except \u201cit depends what you want\u201d. There are tons of very good free VST instruments, for any style, any use. Far to many to count, let alone define one as \u201cbest\u201d. I do love Helm, it\u2019s open-source and great. ",
