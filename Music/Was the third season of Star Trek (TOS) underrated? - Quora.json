            "answer_text": "No it's not underrated. As I'll explain, some individual episodes are. I've read the answers on here, and for the most part, I have no problems. Except with All Our Yesterdays, which I will tackle in a bit. First, I'll tell you that I consider the third season, for the most part, to be a dour and arch affair. The chemistry between Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley that was so carefully cultivated in the second season, was fundamentally broken. It seemed that all the show runners wanted to do was feature episodes where Spock and McCoy were at each other's throats. The Tholian Web, The Paradise Syndrome and All Our Yesterdays are basically ways for the producers to put Spock and McCoy into a box, and have them bicker for half the episode while trying to find Kirk. Second, the third season was full of \"bottle shows\" (shows that take place mostly on the Enterprise). The main culprits here are And the Children Shall Lead, Wink of An Eye, The Mark of Gideon, Lights of Zetar, etc. This was used as a cost saving measure, and, granted there are a lot of shows in season three that used Stage 10, but a lot more didn't. Third and finally, half baked ideas. Spock's Brain, The Savage Curtain, Turnabout Intruder, The Way to Eden. Need I say more. Oh! Howzabout the most unintentionally racist episode of classic Trek ever, The Paradise Syndrome. Trekspertise on YouTube can explain that one better than me:  Now, let's talk about what's good. First, they had to save money, so I'll stress that when they spent it, it was all on screen. The Tholian Web is the best example of this, with Spectre of the Gun coming in a close second. They did a couple of new shots of the 11 foot miniature Enterprise for The Tholian Web which were used in the show as stock footage til cancellation. Second, interesting episodes that were panned when new, and now are getting a second look. This mainly has to do with Spectre of the Gun, one of the most underrated classic Trek episodes ever made, third season or not, and Let That Be Your Last Battlefield. OK, now you probably want a list of best and worsts. Bests:The Empath. I really like the vibe in this episode. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are working together. You have aliens who really don't understand the concept of compassion. They fail to realize that the simple act of offering to make a sacrifice in the service of another is really all that's required. Joyce Muskat as Gem is a revelation, and De Kelley as McCoy is bad ass. Great music by George Dunning and minimal set design by the team. Spectre of the Gun. A race of powerful aliens who don't want to be bothered, plays a mind game with the crew when the Enterprise attempts to make first contact. This episode had been panned in the past, and I didn't like it as a kid because I used to hate westerns (you got Wyatt Earp in my Star Trek...), but now I loves me some westerns, and I can appreciate it for what it is. Kind of the first Twilight Zone style episode and maybe the best set design in TOS. Fantastic music by Jerry Fielding and the Melkot and their space buoy were designed by Mike Minor.* The Tholian Web. You know it, you love it. Spock and McCoy lose Kirk and almost have a fist fight. The first episode with the characters wearing pressure suits. The Tholians, their ships, and the web designed by Mike Minor. Let That Be Your Last Battlefield. Again, some people think this episode isn't great but, in hindsight, it's a product of its time, and you have to give the production company and the network credit for having the balls to air it. There were race riots going on in the US at the time that makes this episode seem heavy handed now, but it was right on point when it aired.** My favorite exchange in the third season may be Commissioner Bele (played by Frank Gorshin; funny, The Riddler playing a Commissioner...) talking to Kirk, Spock, and McCoy about why Bele is pursuing Lokai: Bele: It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an inferior breed.Spock: The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the same breed as yourself.Bele: Are you blind, Commander Spock? Well, look at me. Look at me!Kirk: You are black on one side and white on the other.Bele: I am black on the right side!Kirk: I fail to see the significant difference.Bele: Lokai is white on the right side. All of his people are white on the right side. Whom Gods Destroy. An episode with an interesting premise that kind of falls apart at the end, but it can be forgiven, because overall it's a hoot. Steve Inhat as Garth of Izar gives a fantastic performance, I like that Captain Garth is saved at the end, and I like Yvonne Craig in green paint. The Enterprise Incident. Romulans, romance, and robbery. Trek's first caper episode (CBS was shooting Mission: Impossible on the next set of soundstages over, so, some of that had to rub off) and it comes off without a hitch. Honorable mentions: Day of the Dove, Plato's Stepchildren, That Which Survives, Requiem for Methuselah. Worsts:Spock's Brain Kirk: So, let me get this straight. Your Universal Teacher of all Knowledge, instead of giving you the tools and instructions to build a water treatment plant, tells you to go out and steal my first officer's brain? Kara: Pretty much sums it up. Kirk: Not a good teacher. Spock's body: ... This episode was meant for laughs, but there were no laughs in the third season. The Paradise Syndrome: Racist. See above. For The World is Hollow, and I Have Touched the Sky: Or, How McCoy Got an Incurable Disease and Fell in Love With a Green Goddess on an Asteroid/Spaceship on a Collision Course with Another Planet. This episode just lays there. The Lights of Zetar: Trek's first and only (AFAIK) Mary Sue story. This one could have been so much better if it had been thought through. The Way to Eden: Space hippies. Space. Hippies. Need I say more? The Savage Curtain: This episode was co-written by Gene Roddenberry from his treatment. It plays and feels like a rejected episode of Lost in Space, cause, Janos Prohaska in a rock suit (he was doing the exact same kind of creatures for Irwin Allen in Century City). Also, this is the first mention of the Vulcan philosophy of IDIC; Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations, and you too could get your IDIC pendant for 5 bucks from Lincoln Enterprises. IDIC. Lincoln. See what Gene did there?*** The Mark of Gideon: I've given a pretty detailed answer here: Star Trek: In the episode \"Mark of Gideon\", how have the inhabitants of the planet qualified for Federation membership and kept their population control issue a secret? All Our Yesterdays: While the overall premise of time travel doesn't suck, this episode is, yet again, an attempt by the show runners to get Spock and McCoy into a confrontation and \"learn more\" about Spock (you'd think the two or three times they did it before would be enough). I have a big problem with the fact that Spock, from the 23rd century, is affected in any way by conditions on Vulcan 5,000 years in the past. It would make more sense if he was on Vulcan, not several hundred light years away. It's simply nonsensical. Also, Animated Trek did a way better episode (The Magicks of Megas-Tu) about the Salem witch trials than this one, which just uses it as a melodramatic element this episode doesn't need. And The Children Shall Lead: Kind of like if you took the kids from Miri, made them more obnoxious and gave them an evil psychic guide. This episode fails hard on every level. Guest starring celebrity attorney Melvin Belli as the evil alien. Why? I don't know. You might as well have cast Tiny Tim; at least the episode would have had a ukulele. Turnabout Intruder: Sexist? Not in the ways Elaan of Troyius (a third season [!] episode based on Taming of the Shrew mixed with the Helen of Troy story) or the Next Generation episode The Perfect Mate are, but pretty damn close. The episode that gave truth to the lie that women weren't qualified to command starships. Bill Shatner hams it up cuz it's the last episode, ever. Little did he know... In conclusion, I knock because I love. I could sit and watch all of these episodes and walk away satisfied because I did this every day for years, and never got tired of them. I just hate the fact that this season was the season NBC decided they were going to cancel Star Trek. Period. These shows could have been so much better.  * Rex Holman, the actor who played Morgan Earp in Spectre of the Gun, was also the alien digging holes in the desert in the beginning of Star Trek V.** Let That Be Your Last Battlefield is where we get the famous destruct sequence modified for use in Star Trek III.*** To Prohaska's credit, he did design and perform the Horta in the first season episode The Devil in the Dark.

            "answer_text": "I really enjoy the 3rd season. I understand it is low budget, but I think it\u2019s a great example of making lemonade out of lemons. Much of the writing is excellent and I tend to think of many of the episodes in the sense of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episodes\u2026 plays that focus on the actors rather than the sets. Frankly, the second season had a LOT of re-hashed themes (how many times did we re-visit earth 20th century?) But in the 3rd season, there were some genuinely moving bits of acting\u2026 especially the female characters like The Empath\u2026 and the Priestess of Yonada. Great music too, can\u2019t forget that. Some of the best music ever written for TV. yeah, the sets were sometimes \u2018Lost In Space\u2019 but focus on what really matters\u2026 the ideas, the acting, the music, A lot of it was actually the most mature of the entire run.
