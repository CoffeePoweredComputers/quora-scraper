Best way to gain knowledge is to attend workshops and classes. As you want to learn hiphop at home, I would suggest take online sessions. You can start by beginners classes where you\u2019ll learn the basics. First build up and make your Foundation strong and then you\u2019ll evolve eventually. Once you start learning rest of your way will be clear right infront of you. Keep these 3 thing in your mind.
