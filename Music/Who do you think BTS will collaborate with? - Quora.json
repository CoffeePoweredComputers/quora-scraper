Omg it would be so cool if they collaborate!! I mean her vocals are heavenly! Just imagine: Ariana\u2019s voice and V\u2019s. Alan Walker.  So, Alan Walker isn\u2019t very well known but his music is amazing too. For those who don\u2019t know him (probably everyone reading this) he is a Norwegian DJ. His hit song was Faded with Iselin Solheim (highly recommended, go check it out!) Also Alan Walker and BTS follow each other on Twitter!! I would love to see my favs collaborate :). BLACKPINK.  Now, please don\u2019t attack me ARMYs and BLINKs but I just want this to so badly happen. I love BTS and BLACKPINK and I think it would be really cool if they collaborated! Of course, this will not happen because BigHit isn\u2019t on very good terms with YG Entertainment so\u2026 also there would be more shipping. And dating rumors. I really don\u2019t want that to happen \ud83d\ude2c But they would for sure break even more records! And maybe fan wars between the two fandoms would stop. Purple you, ARMY \ud83d\udc9c ",

            "answer_text": "Ariana Grande I mean what could be better than the two of the biggest musical act teaming up for a song? I also feel like she could harmonize well with them. Troye Sivan The boys really enjoy his music so I feel like they would be more then willing to ask him to be on a song if they thought it fit his voice. Troye has also shown an interest in a collab as of recently. (I may be biased here cause I personally would like to see this collab happen.) H.E.R The boys, more specifically Teahyung, love her music. She was one of the top artists they were excited about seeing at the Grammys and they even got to hand her a reward, which they looked absolutely thrilled about! I could totally see them getting in contact with her for a possible collaboration. Billie Eilish I think Namjoon has recently expressed that he likes her songs and style so she could be a possible contender for a collab. Khalid He\u2019s another artist who\u2019s expressed wanting to do a song with BTS. BTS enjoy his music as well. They\u2019ve also met each other once before so I\u2019m sure they have each other\u2019s contacts if they\u2019re interested in working together. That\u2019s all I can think of off the top of my head at the moment! I\u2019ll be sure add more if I come up with anything else. :) ",
