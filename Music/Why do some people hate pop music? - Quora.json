            "answer_text": "I honestly don\u2019t know. Yet everything about it, including the culture surrounding it, just drives me nuts. A lot of the reasons that I can give for not liking it simply stem from my core, indiscernible instinct of disliking it. I\u2019ll attempt to put it into an analogy one can relate to. Take a sound that you really, really hate. As an example, I\u2019ll use a high pitch squeal, similar to that made by a low brake indicator on a car. Now imagine that\u2019s what lots of people like to listen too and that\u2019s the sound lots of people wish they could make themselves. It\u2019s played in restaurants, malls, shops and at times you hear it blasting from people\u2019s cars. There\u2019s an entire multi-million dollar industry built upon people writing and performing songs with this squeal. The worst part is, because of the nature of the squeal it doesn\u2019t matter how awful it subjectively sounds, it\u2019s \u2018catchy\u2019. You can\u2019t get it out of your head. You listen to it for a minute and then for the next 3 days it keeps playing over and over again in your head. Squuuuuueeeeeeeeeeeal. And from there, all my hate for the nature of the music and the culture around it is, for the most part, simply driven by my natural dislike of the music itself. I try not to rant or express my feelings about it much, because I know that in the end it\u2019s simply a case of \u2018whatever floats your boat\u2019. But sometimes it\u2019s hard. Doesn\u2019t help that I once worked a job where I had to listen to it on speakers for up to 14 hours a day played from a radio station that replayed the same songs once per hour. It was absolute torture. Then I\u2019d get home and it\u2019d still be playing in my head. Really sucked. I wish it didn\u2019t bother me so much, but it just does. I stay mindful though that a lot of the stuff I like to listen too could be perceived exactly the same way. That\u2019s why I never force my passengers to listen to the radio unless I verify it\u2019s something we can all enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't hate all pop music - pop in itself isn't evil. There have been incredible pop musicians in the past (ie. Michael Jackson, Prince, Genesis) who wrote songs that I could listen to over and over again. But I am very selective as to which songs or musicians I listen to. Not because I am pretentious but because pop music has become somewhat stale and unimaginative in order to increase efficiency. After all it, first and foremost, has to sell. Unfortunately the majority of the population love exactly that (At least most people between 0\u201321\u2026 many change their mind slowly but surely when they get older, including myself - but this demographic still spends most of their money on their idols which are here today and gone tomorrow). You might have noticed that the most talented musicians don't always win the big talent shows on TV. If they do, the music they release afterwards barely resembles their real talent. Although many use it as a stepping stone to gain attention. I have seen better musicians on YouTube (who make real music) than on American Idol. My biggest beef with Pop and also Rap and R&B (at least nowadays) is that the same types of songs are being recycled all over and over again and it just sounds like a homogeneous mass production with lyrics that make no sense whatsoever. There is only so much Sam Smith one can listen to (although he started off well) - nowadays most of his songs sound the same. Don't get me started on K-Pop which sounds like something straight out of a tin. I like to listen to music that has an unpredictable melody line and lyrics that carry some meaning (Asians haven't quite figured that out yet, no offense - it's almost like their songs are all based on every Backstreet Boys song from the 90\u2019s). Listen to some music from the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s - it didn't matter so much what the musicians looked like or how many albums they were able to churn out. What mattered was quality - and they mostly wrote their songs themselves. Since the 90\u2019s that has dramatically changed. It's easier to understand if you are a certain age, maybe some nostalgia plays a role (although the 70\u2019s were before my time and I only discovered the 80\u2019s in the 90\u2019s due to my age) but there are quite a few YouTube videos scientifically dissecting and demonstrating the reasons why pop music isn't quite the same as music from the past. Some also point out that modern pop music is pretty much written by the same couple of songwriters. No wonder they all sound the same. Yes, there are exceptions. Sometimes a pop song is being released which is really good and I don't have a problem listening to it. But since the 2000\u2019s there hasn't been any particular song I kept listening to over and over again unlike music that was released before the 00\u2019s) because it all sounds very similar and at least to me, that is not very stimulating.
