            "answer_text": "Elmer Bernstein, perhaps the greatest film composer of the 1960s. He composed scores for The Magnificent Seven, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Great Escape and several other films that defined adventure movies of that era. Many of his theme songs were adopted by Madison Avenue and became associated with major consumer brands. His theme for The Magnificent Seven became \u201cThe Marlboro Theme\u201d and was synonymous with the cowboy culture and the American West. If you haven\u2019t heard ofBernstein, check him out, and see the films he wrote for. Now imagine those movies without his music, and you will understand his genius in a way I can only begin to describe here. ",
