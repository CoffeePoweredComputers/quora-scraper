            "answer_text": "After reading these answers I just wanted to address a few things. The first is that Lil Wayne has had an issue with having ghost writers like Gilly Da Kid. There is not concrete proof either way but the Philly MC makes some compelling point and there is circumstantial evidence to more than suggest Wayne has not written all of his hits. Also Lil Wayne's flow is far from freestyle, his tracks are a result of working to form his bars carefully over time. Neither the style or content is freestyle. By watching any \"freestyle\" of his on youtube they are terrible. He can't deliver coherent original lines, in all instances I've seen he reverts back to lines from a previously written songs.        ***This was basically in response to \"Billy the Squid\" so its believable that Wayne would spit rehearsed lyrics to not look like a fool after being called out for having a ghost writer.  However, neither the alleged ghost writer and/or lack of freestyle ability he is still a incredible rapper who delivers his life story through a style that's part southern, part east coast. That is one of the main reasons for success, he captured east coast listeners like no other dirty south MC ever had (including Outkast and Ludacris). As the birth place of hip-hop an almost unanimous stamp of listening approval is priceless.  The points about all the free mixtapes are very true, the Dedication series and Da Drought series are as iconic as the Carter series. Another over looked point was the team he came up with Hot Boy$ with Birdman and Manny Fresh backing them was an amazing platform, similar to what DC was for Beyonce, or Leaders of the New School for Busta. The credit does then shift back to Wayne for putting in the work and staying hungry.  As an end note I think Wayne's hunger has now turned into a \"do because no one will still stop me\" attitude and is costing him. Literally being number one in so many categories for so long appears to make him feel the world is filled with yes men, which I'm sure his world is. But at the end of the day this isn't \"Wayne's World\" doing things like cursing out NBA Champions, losing major Mountain Dew contracts, or being addicted to Codine possible causing medical problems, isn't the end of Wayne's career but its not the Wayne I first got hooked on.

            "answer_text": "Lil Wayne is successful because he has: An accessible and exciting style andHe uses disruptive marketing techniques.To elaborate:1) Weezy's biggest strength as an artist is also what keeps him from true greatness in my opinion. He gives his American audience what they want: immediate gratification.  When he flows it is essentially freestyle, and as a result he has great presence and agility on the mic. It always feels like the listener and Wayne are listening to the same song as he effortless spits out rhymes in tune with the rhythm and melody of the track. He is not lacking in wit or technical prowess with his rhymes, consistently showing a mastery of metaphors/similes, multi-syllabic rhymes, parallel structure, etc... While this in-the-moment style precludes tightly structured verses and narratives, the good thing for Lil Wayne is that structure and narratives don't necessarily sell albums.  2) In terms of marketing, Weezy was able to answer the following question: How do you sell millions of albums to people who download music for free all the time? Well, you give them lots of free music to download while they're waiting to buy your real album.  For the two years prior to the release of Tha Carter III (which is arguably the point at which he became a superstar), he was featured on many popular tracks and he released numerous free mixtapes; many containing actual freestyles over other artists popular beats that often turned out better than the garbage lyrics that were there in the first place. While mixtapes are common in the industry, it is not common for a mainstream artist to release so many tracks (many for free) without releasing an album, and his prolific output simultaneously garnered press and adoration from hip hop fans thirsty for good hip hop.
