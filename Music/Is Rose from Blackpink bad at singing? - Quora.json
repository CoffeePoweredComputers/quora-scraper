            "answer_text": "I don't think she is bad at singing at all, and the fact that people could even make that opinion about her is just disrespectful to her, and dismissive of her effort, her hard work to get to where she is, and her talents that she has harbored over the years. Singing has always been something she had known since she was young and has been a growing and long lasting interest, and yet to ask such a question about whether she is good or not. It doesn't matter if people think she is or isn't good, because there will always be people who think that her voice is good to them. Of course there are preferences to which voice they like better and Rose\u2019s voice might not suit their tastes well ,but it doesn\u2019t mean that it is bad or that people who don't prefer it hate it, and it just means that they prefer another vocal quality, and it doesn't detract from Roses\u2019s vocal quality which is just as unique and special, and good. There is no such thing as a bad singing voice, especially with someone who has honed in their vocals since debut and have only improved consistently throughout their career. I don't even now why people are still questioning their singing voices because everyone in the group and in the industry are skilled and have different voices. It is only a matter of preference whether someone is more attracted to one voice or the other, but no one does it deem it as bad, and I am pretty sure those who might like or prefer another voice, will respect and appreciate the voice that Rose has. It is not a fact, and although people might claim, that she is bad at singing, I think they are just trying to bring her down, because she clearly is a good singer in her own way with her own voice. They might not like her voice as much, but that is no reason to hate, or bring them down for the voice that that they have and to hold their opinions against them. Just learn to respect her voice for what it is even if people might not like it particularly. There is no reason why she deserves this kind of treatment, especially if her voice is anything but bad, and just because it is different, it doesn\u2019t constitute as bad but just different, and it is only our opinions about it or different tastes in vocals, that they have placed these views on them even if it is far from the truth, and is not even the truth to begin with.

            "answer_text": "No she is not. People think she is bad at it or faking her voice but she is not. Because she has used this voice for covers. but this is just my opinion. Rosie has such a beautiful voice.  Here is a video of her singing!^ Her voice is exactly like an angels. Many people say she fakes her voice but I don\u2019t think so if you see their performances this is her voice. Normally studio versions of songs are edited a bit to make it sound more clearer and for her voice to sound powerful.  But no Chaeyoung does not sing bad at all. Sometimes her voice can crack or just be a bit unstable but because most times they are dancing, but her voice is still beautiful. She has a very unique voice as well.  She can change her singing and still sound beautiful. SO no obviously not she is not a bad singer. Many MR removed videos are also fake so don\u2019t believe them. Many people just take opportunities to bash someone.  Hope this answer helped answer your question!  Bye bye! ",
