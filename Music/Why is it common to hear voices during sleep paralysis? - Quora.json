            "answer_text": "I almost exclusively get sleep paralysis when I'm trying to force my way out of a nightmare. When it does happen, the \u201cmonster\u201d or whoever I was running away from follows me out of the dream and I have vivid (usually tactile and auditory) hallucinations of them. From what I've read up on it, sleep paralysis happens when your brain woke up but your body has not yet, which means you are paralyzed other than being able to open and move your eyes (keep in mind that in REM state, when we dream, our brain induces paralysis so we do not end up moving or hurting ourselves). This only lasts a moment, but our minds panic and try to make sense of it by (usually) inventing a force that is pushing you down onto the bed and not allowing you to move. Now, as inventive and versatile our brain can be when creating a dream, is exactly as inventive and versatile the \u201cforce\u201d will be. You may hear, see, and or vividly feel someone or something. Fear often accompanies the experience. The moment usually does not last long enough for us (or at least me) to process it and realize what is going on, but if it ever does I suggest you speak to yourself in a calm manner (no matter what is going on), reminding yourself that it is just your brain's reaction to a perfectly normal event, and tell yourself that it will be over very soon because, as you speak, your body is waking up.

            "answer_text": "I have had sleep paralysis about a dozen times. I heard very clear voices four times. When I hear voices they are perfectly clear. Three of the times the voice was repeating a word over and over. Now sleep paralysis only lasts for a minute or two, and as my body slowly recovered from sleep paralysis the voice would change. For instance, in one case I heard the word \u201cfantastic\u201d repeating, and as it faded I noticed that a dog was barking outside. It seems my subconscious was incorporating the sound of a dog into my dream state and making it into a word I understood. In sleep paralysis we may think we are fully conscious but in fact we are still in a sleep state and capable of having a dream. While in a dream your subconscious can incorporate any sounds into part of the dream. They are auditory hallucinations. You can even have your eyes open, looking around your room, and have a dream sequence take place. Yes, its weird, but its entirely natural. ",
