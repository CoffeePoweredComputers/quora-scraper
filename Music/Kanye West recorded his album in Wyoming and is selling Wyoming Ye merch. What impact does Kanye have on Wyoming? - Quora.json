Because he came here and used Wyoming to improve his image, now people out there think Wyoming is a thing and want to come here.\u201d Just three nights ago, she and her boyfriend went to the Ned LeDoux concert at the base of Snow King Mountain. My ski shuttle bus passengers were excited about the news of him and his celebrity partner during the winter but many of us just don\u2019t understand why rap is still with is after all these years. Many suspect creativity in musical innovation began to atrophy in the 1990s. A great percentage of Wyoming residents already disrespect Teton County as \u201cthe fake west\u201d because of fame, beauty, commercialization and Hollywood types. It is an exaggeration and does not do justice to what real West is but I expect this non event will deepen the rift.

That being said it\u2019s very understandable why he chose Jackson, because as I have said before most of the rest of us that live here(especially ones like me that multi-generational)aren\u2019t sure if Jackson is a part of Wyoming. This town is a weird mixture of extreme liberalism and conservatism. I\u2019m just glad that most people have short memories and it will be forgotten that he was ever here. ",
