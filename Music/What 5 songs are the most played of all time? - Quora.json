            "answer_text": "Strap in\u2026 This may be a surprise. When it comes to \u201cThe most played song of all time,\u201d it depends how you measure things. Lets look at a few of history\u2019s contenders. We\u2019ll call a \u201csong,\u201d a \u201ctune with lyrics\u201d.We\u2019ll also aggregate the meaning of \u201cplay\u201d to include \u201cperformed,\u201d \u201csung\u201d and \u201cpresented on any media\u201d.For a long time, the most played and performed song of all time was \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d. The melody was adapted from 1912\u2019s \u201cGood Morning To All\u201d.  Image: The \u201cmost played melody.\u201d Credit: Happy Birthday to You. Warner Chappell bought the rights holders, Birch Tree Group for USD$25m in 1988 and for a quarter-century, made more than $2m every year from licensing copyright and performance.  After a landmark court case in 2013, Warner settled with licensees of the song for $14m. \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d has been in the public domain ever since. For a long time, \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d would have been the most played song of all time.  Over the last few decades, Disney also laid claim to the most played song\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s a Small World.\u201d  The amusement ride theme, played worldwide at the Paris, Tokyo, Shanghai and US parks, has 50 million radio plays, including ads.  If we include performances by struggling guitar players, covers bands and singers as well as plays across all media? There\u2019s a song which has to be considered: Led Zeppelin\u2019s 1971 epic, \u201cStairway to Heaven.\u201d  Before modern music distribution systems there were other \u201cmost played contenders\u201d: Chubby Checker, \u201cThe Twist\u201d;The Righteous Brothers, \u201cYou\u2019ve Lost that Lovin\u2019 Feelin\u2019,\u201d and \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d;The Eagles, \u201cHotel California\u201d;Pink Floyd, \u201cComfortably Numb\u201d;Queen, \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d;The Beatles, \u201cYesterday\u201d.These all earned gongs for \u201cmost played song\u201d and still make the list today.  Now that music media has brought product into homes across the world via the internet, the \u201cmusic game\u201d has fundamentally changed. Spotify has made it clear that one song has eclipsed most others by an order of magnitude with two billion plays.  Add other media? Ed Sheeran has a candidate: \u201cShape of You.\u201d The song has 4\u00bc billion plays on YouTube alone.  Which brings us to today\u2019s \u201cmost played song\u201d of all time. The song was first released in 2017\u2014by latin / reggaeton singer, Luis Fonsi and rapper, Daddy Yankee. Latin music dwarfs other genres worldwide for both sales and plays. After a 2017 remix cover by Justin Bieber, \u201cDespacito\u201d was re-released by the Puerto Rican duo this year, 2019.  With near 6\u00bd billion plays on YouTube, add streaming media, broadcast, radio delivery and performance? \u201cDespacito\u201d (\u201cSlowly\u201d) is as of right now, the most played song of all time.  The next ten years will be hard for older fans and fans of the old. Rihanna is about to eclipse the Beatles\u2019 total sales records.Drake has smashed most artist\u2019s No. 1\u2019s already.U2 will beat the Stones\u2019 tix numbers if they can hold it together.Beyonc\u00e9 will get the gross concert turnover marks.The artist who will outshine them all is likely alive already. \u2014My answer to, \u201cWhat band has sold the most concert tickets of all time?\u201d I\u2019ve said before, \u201cit\u2019s called the music business for a reason.\u201d Answers like these attract enormous controversy. Diehard fans with a lifetime of memories look back to a past which can\u2019t possibly equal the future. Music distribution has radically changed. So too, has the \u201cmost played song.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of good answers here; some listed five, some listed a lot more. I want to list just one that I did not see in any of the answers. I would like to nominate \u201cTurkey in the Straw.\u201d Quite a hillbilly song; sounds good on a harmonica, a banjo, and even a mouth harp. It got played at square dances and get togethers. But its biggest run was on the ice cream truck. In my own home town, it was played repeatedly on the ice cream scooter as it rounded every block in town, every day, over and over and over. In high school, desperate for a job, I drove it for three weeks one summer, and it played all night while I slept. I finally decided that poverty was better than insanity. I moved to other towns because of college and a job, and was surprised to find that \u201cTurkey in the Straw\u201d was a favorite of ice cream trucks and scooters all over the area I grew up. It may not still be in the top five, as times have changed. There are less ice cream trucks now, less kids outside playing on a hot summer day with a nickel available, and less people willing to drive a scooter all day for minimum wage. On top of that, this past summer, I was in my home town, visiting my parents, and did my mile at the local park. I heard the melody of an ice cream truck, and realized that something was wrong. As it got closer, I realized that everything had changed. It was playing \u201cLa Cucuracha.\u201d ",
