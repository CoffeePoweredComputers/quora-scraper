            "answer_text": "You seem to be seeking a fair use exception, being aware that only part of a work can be included in yours. But fair use doesn't define how much is too much. It has to be decided Everytime someone sues. Your bigger problem is that you don't fit two of the other fair use rules. (Plus we don't know if you live in the U.S. Other countries don't have fair use.) There are a narrow set of purposes: parody or review of the included work. You description didn't say that was your plan, so you don't fall inside fair use. You are also causing the musician to lose out on the licensing fee they expert when their music is the sound track to a video. This isn't fair use. You need permission. ",
