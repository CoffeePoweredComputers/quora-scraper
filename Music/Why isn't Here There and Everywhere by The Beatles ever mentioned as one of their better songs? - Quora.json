            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very well-crafted song, and\u2014tear-jerking personal anecdote alert!\u2014it happens to have been my parents\u2019 favourite Beatle song. They met in London in the mid-60s and I grew up in a house that had their copies of Revolver and Sgt Pepper. When my dad died in 1996, my mother left a card on his coffin with a line from the song: Each one believing that love never dies. If you\u2019ve sufficiently recovered from that to read on, I think one reason why it\u2019s not more popular is that it\u2019s rather cosy and complacent. McCartney wanted to write a song expressive of being in love and nothing being wrong. He succeeded, but the result is like drinking dessert wine and eating too many cakes: excessively sugary. \u2018Good Day Sunshine\u2019 has a spring in its step, but \u2018Here There and Everywhere\u2019 lacks the power and energy to charm anyone who isn\u2019t already in its rather sleepy and self-satisfied mood. That\u2019s my opinion, anyway, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why I disagree with the notion that Revolver is the band\u2019s best album. This is a song that I invariably skip. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it was mentioned by Lennon as one of their better songs. According to McCartney it was more or less the only McCartney song that Lennon complimented him on. I think it is a wonderful song, and listen to the other takes of the song, McCartney does some amazing singing in the different versions and rehearsals. Perhaps it isn\u2019t more famous because it is too similar in genre to Yesterday.. or because there are so many good songs in The Beatles\u2019 catalogue. Unlike Yesterday or For No-one, there is no real pain or tension in the song. Despite it being about wanting a distant lover, it really is just a positive declaration of love, superbly sung. ",
