            "answer_text": "Yep! Honestly though, the best advice I could give you is to stop worrying about choosing a DAW. Just grab whatever you feel drawn to. Or grab whatever your friends are using (being able to talk through issues or new stuff you learn with your peers is so valuable). Or buy a groove box like the Novation Circuit or theTeenage Engineering OP-Z and go DAWless. Just don't waste time wondering where to start. Pick whatever medium speaks to you and works for your budget, pull the trigger, fire it up, and start. The worst thing you can do right now is waste the spark you're feeling to make music by wondering where to start, or debating which is better. At the end of the day, they're all designed to do the same thing and no one is better than another. Sure, you'll get fan boys and girls from everywhere giving you a million reasons why their software is the best. They'll post everywhere and go on and on about blah blah blah. Ya know what? Those people. They do a lot of talking. And if they have that much time to talk they're not spending that time making music. Which means they probably haven't taken the time to learn the things they're speaking against. Fwiw, I've been an FL Studio user for years now and love it. I started with FL and so far haven't found anything I want to do with it that it can't do. If I ever do I'll consider switching then, but I don't see that day coming any time soon. Pick one. Any one. And start :) Best of luck to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Genuinely, all the music production software or Digital Audio workstation (DAW) do the same things. For someone like you who is beginner Fl studio is a good choice because it has a simple and friendly workflow, great mixer, amazing step sequencer and piano roll and so on, but keep in your mind not to consider it like computer game such as some producers who are criticizing it in an unfair manner just like when they want to persuade newbies like you to accept that the Cubase or the Studio one are better or more professional than Fl studio (I said it as an instance).when you want to select a DAW you have to consider a few points Is it easy to learn ? [Do you have access to the related online sources or any friend to ask question about its details,\u2026]Is it compatible with you computer?Can you afford to purchase its license when you reach to the further level to use it as a professional career or you prefer to learn something cheaper or more limited?As a conclusion I highly recommend it because when you have creativity and knowledge to write a song or basics about arranging it in your mind, you will be able to implement all of your idea in that ",
