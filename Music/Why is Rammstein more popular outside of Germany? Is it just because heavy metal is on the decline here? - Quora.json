            "answer_text": "Maybe it\u00b4s time for a second answer by someone who actually likes them. In my opinion, Till Lindemann\u00b4s writing is somewhat brilliant. For my final essay in high school (Facharbeit) I analyzed three songs of theirs (Haifisch, Rosenrot and Morgenstern) as well as two poems by Till Lindemann - and let me tell you, that man for me sure knows how to put german words to good use. Sure, if you listen to it the first time, maybe even the second or third time, it seems like it is simple Industrial Metal, paired with angry german singing and rolling r\u00b4s. But you also have to consider that, in order to transport their music, Rammstein have chosen this martial layout very carefully. If Till Lindemann was just another german schlager musician, I seriously doubt anybody would have recognized the hidden depth of his lyrics. His father was a famous author of kids books back in the DDR and his mother is a journalist - I don\u00b4t think he did not inherit at least some lyrical talent. But let\u00b4s get back to your question: Recently, a friend of mine who spent two years traveling the USA, South America and Australia asked me \"Why do so many people think that just because I\u00b4m german I listen to Rammstein? I hate this band.\" - and I think this is what depicts this circumstance pretty well. German people generally tend to disapprove of most stuff that reminds them of WWII, Hitler and Nazi Germany, therefore Rammstein with Flamethrowers, edgy sound and german lyrics (including the beforementioned and infamous rolling \"r\") are doing all too well at reminding people of all this stuff - but that\u00b4s exactly why they chose this whole combination: to polarize, to make people like or dislike them, I\u00b4ve met people who love them (Including myself) and people who downright hate them - but I\u00b4ve barely met anyone who goes \"I like some of their stuff, but not everything.\" But, and I\u00b4m sorry to have lost track again, I think the point is that Rammstein isn\u00b4t actually more popular outside Germany - there\u00b4s just less people in Germany who openly admit to like them.

            "answer_text": "Mortal Kombat introduced me to Rammstein    It features the English version of Engel.   The entire soundtrack is phenomenal, but Engel is a key song on it. Scooter, KMFDM, Megadeth, and Libra were most memorable. I can recall the lyrics today. I never heard another song by Libra, but that sinister \"Calling your name\" was a great track. It was later used in American Pie soundtrack.   Engel also had another genius element. At 3:13, the song switches to German. The listener realizes this is not an American band and that it sounds better in German. The movie doesn't have great reviews, but I enjoyed it. Moreover, I watched it several times because of its soundtrack. It just sounded really amazing at the theater.   This is the entire soundtrack, track list is in the description. This was Rammstein's second appearance on a US major motion picture soundtrack. The first was on Lost Highway in 1996, which is a movie I haven't seen yet. It featured \"Rammstein\" and \"Heirate Mich\". Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails produced the soundtrack. The soundtrack featured NIN's \"The perfect drug\" as the original song for the film. Trent had an early interest in Rammstein before that as well. One of the songs chosen by Trent Reznor was entitled \"Rammstein\", which told the audience who was sang it. Of course, we should also recognize Rammstein's excellent video quality. Here is the video for Engel in German. The content is as far from angelic as you can get.   Heavy metal radio in USA gave lots of airplay to Rammstein. Although the seminal \"Du Hast\" exists in English, it sounds much better in German. And so DJs put the German version of the song on the air. This is distinctive and stands out from every song that airs in English even if the songs feature unintelligible lyrics. You can probably attribute that decision to making Rammstein the most well known German band who sings in German in USA. Other well-known German bands like Scorpions, although they are one of my favorite bands, and Nena don't count. I only heard Scorpions sing in English. I am sure they have releases in German, but I never encountered them until I looked for them. Nena's 99 Luftballoons also got airplay in German and was a massive hit, but the band no longer records new hits. KMFDM is unknown to most people and again has releases in English.  KMFDM is notable for being Rammstein's first US tour partner where Rammstein was its opening band. Metallica was also once an opening act with the Damage, Inc. tour that eclipsed its headliner when they opened for Ozzy Osbourne March-August 1986, and became the headliner starting in September. Something similar happened with Rammstein as the opening act for KMFDM although it's not clear whether they became the official headlining act on that tour.  \"They stole the show - when KMFDM came on, people were throwing things at them and yelling to get RAMMS+EIN back on the stage!!! That was unbelievable!\" - KMFDM/Rammstein 97 Tour After that came the Family Values Tour with Korn, Limp Bizkit, Crystal Method, and Rob Zombie. The rest was history. :) They also know how to appeal to the audience in the country they are signing. This is brilliant marketing. The songs \"Amerika\" and \"Moskau\" are targeted at foreign audiences to elicit the sense of familiarity. Rammstein is very popular in Russia. Moskau had me laughing for a long time the first time I heard it. The chorus is actually in Russian and it's a Pioneer song, hence the outfits. The lyrics in German compare Moscow to a older call girl.  The song Amerika might as well be \"Bye, bye miss American Pie\". ;) It mentions White House, Mickey Mouse, Coca-Cola, and Santa Claus. Note how subtly it mentions the global influence of America, but it does so only in German.  There also was the unfortunate media reaction following Columbine shooting, which put Rammstein and KMFDM in national news. I don't think Rammstein got anywhere this level of promotion in Germany. I think there were five factors Trent ReznorTwo major motion picture releases prior to release of SensuchtMelodic Engel in English being the \"gateway drug\" to the rest of their musicBecoming a headliner of a major US heavy metal tour like Family ValuesRadio airplay in German language",
