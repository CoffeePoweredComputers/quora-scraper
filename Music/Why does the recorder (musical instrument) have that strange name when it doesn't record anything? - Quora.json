            "answer_text": "Because \u201crecording\u201d was once used to mean \u201cpractice\u201d (or perhaps \u201cplay) music. Recorders are somewhat easy to play instruments and are relatively inexpensive so were often used for students to \u201crecord\u201d or practice music. They are many hundreds of years older than they first musical audio or digital recording devices. ",

            "answer_text": "The original meaning of the verb \u201cto record\u201d was to memorize, to commit something (verse, music, etc.) to heart, to practice something over and over again. This diverged into two connotations: One about the memorizing. For example, an early meaning of \u201crecorder\u201d was a clerk, say in a court, who wrote down information. He recorded information, so he was a recorder.One that focused on the practicing of a tune, eventually to playing a tune. A recorder then was the musical instrument one used to practice or play a tune.",
