            "answer_text": "The i7-7700HQ has higher base clocks (2.8 vs 1.6 GHz) and will turbo to 3.8 GHz (single core) but the performance difference will be minimal unless you\u2019re running applications which rely on peak single threaded performance. Both those processors are Kaby Lake chips but the 7700HQ has three times the TDP of the i5-8250U (45 vs 15W) so it will use more power, run hotter, throttle more and will dissipate a lot more heat, meaning that the laptop fans will quickly ramp up under load and all this will reduce battery life. It\u2019s a matter of preference. For better performance, go with the 7700HQ but if you care about energy efficiency and longer battery, then the 8250U might be the better choice. ",

            "answer_text": "DAW doesn\u2019t require especially good hardware, all the big machines you see people use are synthesizers which produce the sound wave through specialized circuit boards. Both are great mobile CPUs more than enough for DAW software, with the i7 7700HQ able to sustain a higher clock speed than the i5 8250U. Both have similar peak performance, but the i5 8250U throttles down to around 70% of the performance of the i7 7700HQ when under continuous load. ",
