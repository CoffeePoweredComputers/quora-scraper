            "answer_text": "M-AUDIO AXIOM is my personal favorite with artists such as Moby, Linkin Park, Zedd and Paul Van Dyk to have been seen using it live or in their recording studios. It will last for long and is compatible with all major DAW\u2019s and in your case Logic Pro X! ARTURIA KEYLAB is also a great option with vintage design and appearance but most important a very nice feel of the keys. And of course the best seller of all MIDI keyboard controllers the AKAI MPK2. It is also highly recommended by users with excellent ratings on online stores\u2026 Other choices would be NEKTAR PANORAMA P4 and the budget friendly NOVATION IMPULSE For friendly budget MIDI keyboards i would suggest the NOVATION LAUNCHKEY MINI 25, AKAI MPK MINI MK2 with a nice 4-way thumb-stick to control your pitch/mod and also the ALESIS V25.

            "answer_text": "Logic Pro doesn\u2019t care what MIDI controller you are using just as it doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s using it. As long as the MIDI controller can send out CC messages, you can patch them to virtually any destination inside Logic Pro X. If you want to use the controller to trigger drum machines in Logic, choose a controller that has drum pads. If you want to operate the mixer, choose the one that has motorised/magnetic & touch sensitive faders, and if you want to control the synthesisers in Logic, then choose the one that has a lot of rotary knobs. Several manufacturers offer MIDI controllers with all these features, and more, and are priced accordingly. Some popular MIDI controller manufacturers are: Avid, Novation, Arturia, Behringer (MOT\u00d6R 49), Akai, Korg, M-audio, Alesis, Mackie, etc. ",
