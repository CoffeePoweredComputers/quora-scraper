I\u2019m afraid there is no way to see your most played songs on your Spotify app, they only show you your top listen to artists. which is pretty strange. I guess they do that so you will always be willing to listen to new music or related songs and artists. What you can do, is create your playlists with your favorite songs and place all the new songs you want to keep listening to. That\u2019s what I do. I just add the song I like in that moment to my playlist and if I don\u2019t want to hear it again on that playlist I remove it. ",

EDIT I\u2019ve decided to add a few images to introduce more credibility to the link.  The list is cropped but the site actually gives the top 50 artists/songs for each time frame.  Would you believe me if I said Twenty One Pilots has a new album? ",
