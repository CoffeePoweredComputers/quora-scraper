            "answer_text": "Haydn. Haydn, you say? But he\u2019s one of the most famous composers who ever lived. Quite. But I keep seeing disparaging comments about Haydn \u2014 his music isn\u2019t sufficiently emotional, he was an also-ran to Mozart. Well, if you need a half hour of bombast to feel something, yes, his music is emotionally restrained. But we\u2019ve been desensitized by Beethoven and romanticism. Haydn\u2019s contemporaries found his music anything but lacking in emotional impact. One has only to listen with an open ear to hear what they did. And sure, he didn\u2019t quite equal Mozart at his best. But then, no one did save Bach and Beethoven. What Haydn had was infinite inventiveness and a knack for writing music that never fails to astound and delight, in vast quantity. The string quartets alone are among the greatest of artistic accomplishments. ",

            "answer_text": "For the \u201cclassical\u201d music crowd they probably have someone specific right out of the bat. I like this type of music but I have always been more into popular music (although as time passes I find myself dedicating slightly more time and a bit more attention to classical). And for people with a more mainstream and pop experience of music anyone that isn't Mozart, Beethoven or one of the great movie composers can be thought of as underrated, I'm guessing even J. S. Bach. 20th century composers are even more unknown and/or underrated, most people can't name a 20th century composer if you take out John Williams and the rest of the best known movie composers. If they can name one it's usually John Cage. So to go with the flow of my thoughts (iniatially I was thinking that maybe I could answer with Bach) I would name Edgar Var\u00e8se as my choice of underrated just because I like his music, isn't all too famous and Poeme electronique is an important composition and part of the history of electronic music.
