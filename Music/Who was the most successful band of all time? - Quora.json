            "answer_text": "Success in the music industry is two pronged,first you get your album sales,then you get your gig or concert ticket sales. If a band sells a million copies but fails to draw large crowds to fill up stadiums. Then you get your bands that have poor album sales but have sell-out shows everywhere they perform. When a company like Samsung pre-orders 10 million copies of Jay Z's album to load on it's devices in an attempt to boost mobile sales,does that one massive transaction make Jay Z the most successful rapper of all time?
