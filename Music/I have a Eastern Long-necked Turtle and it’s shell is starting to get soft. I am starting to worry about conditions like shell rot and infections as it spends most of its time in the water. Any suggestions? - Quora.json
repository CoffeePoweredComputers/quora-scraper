            "answer_text": "This sounds like either a) shell rot or b) lack of calcium. If it\u2019s a) you would see brown spots that are soft, not the whole shell. You can correct this by cleaning the turtle with a toothbrush, dust it down with a little dry iodine spray and keep his surroundings scrupulously clean, it can be reversed. if it\u2019s b) then you need to get more calcium into your turtle. There are a number of ways of doing this. The vet can give you supplements, but it\u2019s better to try and do it naturally. Some turtles will eat cuttlefish bone that you can get from the pet store, in the pet bird aisle. Mine prefer hard boiled eggs with the shell left on. They will eat the whole thing, shell and all. It\u2019s not unusual for turtles to prefer to spend most of their lives in water, but a dry place for them to bask should always be available. At the moment I have a little common musk boy in an emergency tank and he basks on top of a little laundry basket. In either case I would show your turtle to a reptile vet, just to rule out anything more serious. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Ok calm down! First it could be as simple as not enough calcium in your turtles diet! Your turtle needs calcium and lighting is very important! What you\u2019re describing is called MBD metabolic bone disease! You don\u2019t say how old your turtle is so I\u2019m going to give general guide here! You need UV light for your turtle that\u2019s how they make vitamin D! Now they also require fresh food fish, earthworms, crickets are just a couple of suggestions! Now if it\u2019s shell rot you need to get your turtle to the vet! ",
