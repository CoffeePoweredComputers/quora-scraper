            "answer_text": "Hi there, BiG YES !!! Listen to your childhood music songs and you\u2019ll get that feeling back from back then. When some problems or stress hit you, then listen to music and your mood will improve immediately. That\u2019s the power of music. making your own music song is a creative process, that will make you grow positively as you are starting to understand the flow of energy that is inside of the music; both for the creator of a song, and also the people that listen to it. there is music and everything, you just have to sense it, to experience it, to enjoy it. Take some time to listen to binaural beats, those are megahertz frequency\u2019s that are everywhere, some are designed to offset how your ears receive the tunes/frequencies. Those tunes/frequencies can be used to help you get a better sleep, improve your studying capacity, and there are many other frequencies that can do good things (and bad things too). That\u2019s the power of music. ",
