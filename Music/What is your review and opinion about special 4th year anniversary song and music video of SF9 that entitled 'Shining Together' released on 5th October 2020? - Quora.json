            "answer_text": "Sorry for answering this so late, I'm two weeks late I know. I won't do a review, this answer won't be THAT long, there isn't much to review especially cuz they didn't have a choreography. I cried when I watched the MV honestly. It was so beautiful. How they were looking at their memories they have shared together in these 4 years with Fantasy. The pictures hanged on the wall and some members watching preformance videos. I felt piece watching them sing that song. My opinion on the song?    I'm gonna be honest, I cried a little at the end cuz I then started to think why they released 3 MVs only this year, before the debut of FNCs new boy group. I hope it doesn't mean they'll be less active. FNC have a really bad habit. And that's forgetting their past groups, like N.Flying, CN Blue, Honeyst (they deserved better). I just hope all the content, comebacks, dramas etc wasn't meant for disbandment\u2026. I really don't want them to disband I'm not ready for that yet. However the MV used alot of memories from the past. Pictures, videos, letter.   My heart couldn't take the part where the members sat on watched their past videos at all         (Sorry my fault. I couldn't take a perfect ss of that part) The MV is my favorite MV out of all their comebacks they've had!! This comeback definitely showcased their vocals very well and the rap parts were also great! I just hope what I think of the reason of this comeback is not true but an improvement in the company's promotion instead. Listen to Fanfare their debut song, before leaving.  Hope you have a nice day!! ",
