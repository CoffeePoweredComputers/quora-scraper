            "answer_text": "I don't think good, but we'll know supwr soon enough. Looking at clips online the last few years, he seems stuck in a broken falsetto.  Totally to be expected with age. But, ac/dc is ALL screaming,  and we know axl has been rehearsing with them, too.  Maybe he did some work and got some steroid shots and is ready to rock again. With his abysmal track record for skipping shows, starting riots, and being late to stage by three hours each and every night, I am not confident in a great outcome.  Great thing is we all get to see how vegas goes before we buy tickets for the new tour. ",

The shavings being poured into said fans head may cause hallucinations and euphoria making them believe they are hearing Axl in his prime ",
