            "answer_text": "You are cracking because you are *trying* to produce vibrato. You are trying to force your voice to do something and this tension is forcing your vocal folds to give out and that causes the cracking. Vibrato is produced naturally when the voice is completely relaxed. Sometimes people produce a false vibrato. Often the false vibrato is created by wavering the pitch, and it often comes by mimicking others without understanding what vibrato is for. The natural vibrato allows the vocal folds to relax and vibrate as the air passes, rather than being smacked together with a straight tone or kept apart with an overly breathy technique. In order to resolve this, you would need to learn how to relax your voice. An excellent teacher can help you recognize the sources of your vocal tension and remove the tension one at a time by healthy vocal habits built from proper practice. If you don\u2019t understand the sensations of good vs bad vocal habits, you won\u2019t be able to fix it. ",

            "answer_text": "Take some lessons (I liked \u201cItalian method\u201d) and if that\u2019s not possible, just learn to breath with your diaphragm. Do not tighten your throat or \u201ctry\u201d to \u201csing with vibrato\u201d - it\u2019s not about your throat, it\u2019s about breathing. -Just get lots of air, push it out steadily \u201cover the top\u201d (lessons will teach you breath control) - RELAX - and LET your vibrato kick in. Takes practice. Again - take a few lessons from a good/recommended teacher if you can afford it. If you\u2019ve never had lessons before, your singing will improve by 100% in a very short time (a month or so). If you like singing, invest in it, and take some lessons. Find the best, most respected voice teacher in your area. ",
