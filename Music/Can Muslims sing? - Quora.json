            "answer_text": "Majority and strong opinion of scholars of quran and sunnah is that anything which is accompanied by Music is haraam. Allaah says in Soorat Luqmaan (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah\u2026\u201d [Luqmaan 31:6] The scholar of the ummah, Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: this means singing. Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this means playing the drum (tabl). (Tafseer al-Tabari, 21/40). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAmong my ummah there will certainly be people who permit zinaa, silk, alcohol and musical instruments\u2026\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari ta\u2019leeqan, no. 5590; narrated as mawsool by al-Tabaraani and al-Bayhaqi. See al-Silsilah al-Saheehah by al-Albaani, 91. Look where music instrument has its place.! The Instrument of Daff is the only exception at the days of Eid and other important celebration as indicated by some narrations. Important thing to be noted is that it is permissible only to WOMEN. For men it is Haraam. Also as a general rule,In Islam anything which is amusement or Timepass which moves you away from the remembrance of Allah is Haraam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cDo you then wonder at this recitation (the Qur\u2019aan)? And you laugh at it and weep not, Wasting your (precious) lifetime in pastime and amusements(music and singing) \u201d [al-Najm 53:59-61] Singing without Music. As for singing or humming a few (poetic) verses in which there is praise of Allaah or commending some good characteristics and other good meanings, the basic principle is that poetry is words; if the words are good it is good and if they are bad it is bad. So if the words are free of any bid\u2019ah or exaggeration that is condemned by sharee\u2019ah, and it is free of any bad or ugly words that are inappropriate and should not be said of Allaah, then it is acceptable to sing such things occasionally, on condition that it is not done in the manner of singers and promiscuous people (those immoral singers and their songs which romantizes adultry,alcoholism, exhibitionism etc), because that is imitating people of immorality and sin (\u201cand whoever imitates a people is one of them\u201d). Hating those singers for the sake of Allaah implies that we should not resemble them or imitate their style of singing. The believer should glorify and venerate Allaah by reciting aayahs from the Qur\u2019aan and dhikr as prescribed in sharee\u2019ah, and du\u2019aa\u2019s narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) If he occasionally recites some verses of poetry which praise Allaah and mention His blessings and bounty, there is nothing wrong with that so long as they meet the conditions mentioned above. Hence Singing any poetry without music which makes you to remember Allah is fine and anything which makes you forget Allah and dwell upon worldly pleasures is Haraam. And Allaah knows best.

            "answer_text": "Singing is allowed--it is completely helal. There are far too many ultra conservatives today claiming that singing is haram--let alone music--but even music is helal. Most hadiths i have heard on music are not from reputable sources. And when the Prophet (savs) came to Medine he was welcomed with music and singing. The music they played is now even famous within the Islamic world, known as Tela El-Badru Eleyna. There is certainly debate on whether music is haram or helal within the Ummet. But the fact stands, from my viewpoint and the viewpoint of most Sunni and Shia schools that as long as the music does not depict something Haram, and expresses something poignant about the Human condition or glorifies Allah (svt) then it is perfectly permissible. I'm providing a link of all the Hadiths proving Music is helal below. Check them out. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The general ruling on all things haram is - what is the purpose of the action. If it has a clearly positive outcome it\u2019s usually allowed. If the end result is beneficial then it may be allowed. So the recommended reason or time for singing would be to incorporate that into a prayer of some kind or dedicate it to The One God, dedicate the lyrics to Islam and have the intention of increasing yours, or others, faith. Although some ultra-traditional conservative Imams may rule it as pointless and ban it entirely, it depends on the region and culture where that sect or flavor of Islam is taught. And, ultimately, it depends on what is said in the Quran, as the Quran cannot be contradicted so any verse regarding singing should be the official ruling despite any fatwas issued. And if it\u2019s not mentioned in the Quran - then read different viewpoints on the subject and listen to your heart, it should be between you and God whether or not singing is beneficial. ",

It doesn\u2019t stop me from bothering my family, though :) If you are asking if my religion has some sort of a rule that would advice not to sing (or listen to those who sing beautifully), there isn\u2019t. As a matter of a fact, singing is encouraged in Islam, partially because the point of religion is to revive spirit and recharge batteries, and the effect of music is just that. By the way, even the prayers in Islam are sung. listen to this - a guy can apparently sing - call for a prayer. If you youtube some Qur\u2019an recitation, you might come across some nice versions. As for singing Islamic beautiful songs, this is one of my favorite:  Bosnian spiritual music concert:  and rock version of the same:  But i usually listen to Iron Maiden and try to play their songs.

And that singing or abstinence from singing does not make you more or less religious. Of course anti religious dirges or lyrics contrary to Islamic values would not be tolerated.Most Islamic countries have a national anthem. ",
