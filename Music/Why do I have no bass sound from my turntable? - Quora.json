            "answer_text": "Why do I have no bass sound from my turntable? I have an older Rega Planar 3 and a Sugden amp. Both speakers work but the sound is lacking any volume or bass, very \u2018tinny'. I think the issue is with the RCA leads/ plugs from the Rega to the amp. Moving the plugs in the back of the amp makes the sound and volume improve sometimes and creates a lot of humming. The plugs have been cleaned to no avail. I'm wondering if I can easily change the RCA plugs on the leads from the turntable though nothing is obviously visually wrong with them. The amp works perfectly through the CD sockets, its only the phono feed that is a problem. ",

            "answer_text": "LP records use the RIAA equalization curve which reduces the bass and increases the treble prior to being recorded on the vinyl - this reduces the otherwise great bass excursion of the groove and needle. On playback the bass is boosted to restore the original frequency balance. If you do not have a phono preamp with equalizer built in but are just using an aux or tape input then you will be severely lacking in bass.  ",
