            "answer_text": "Spotify is unbeatable with its collection. You can stream millions of songs produced by a plethora of artists. The music recommendations are spot on. If you want to discover new music based on a song that you like, I\u2019m pretty sure Spotify won\u2019t ever let you down. SoundCloud; on the other hand, is meant for distribution, promotion of one\u2019s own music. Its a great platform for creators to share their musical oeuvre, especially those who are starting out and maybe build a fan base? Also, for a non musician, if you are looking for music licensed under creative commons for some project or YouTube videos, SoundCloud is definitely a much better choice to consider and to explore music by talented unknown artists. You end up using cool music (without copyright issues, albeit a bit tricky to find) and also promoting some unknown musician\u2019s charming work. They are both excellent platforms. It depends on what you are looking for as a consumer. ",

            "answer_text": "uneducated college student here, so it may not be completely accurate, or lack some details. the general gist should be valid, though. soundcloud is free (they have no real way they're making a profit from your music so this is a reasonable assumption), so you're giving people free samples or even actual free listens to your music, and will make no money from them. on the other hand, it also has no requirements for getting in, and most people who really like your song will pay the dollar to own the mp3 file, and those who don't will find it on youtube anyways. soundcloud also lets some people link to other sites to get the music- though i don't know if everyone can use it, or if it's part of their premium user services. so if you're also selling it- say on bandcamp, since that seems to be popular- you can add a link by your song. if they don't allow that, put it in the text of your song's description, which gets the same general effect, if the user is actively looking for it. spotify pays you (by the veiw, i would guess), but it is my understanding that you have to be decently popular to get on there and it can be pretty hard for them to find you there- it's a lot less \"social media\", which is both a pro and a con. if you find the song on spotify, it can be worth listening, but most of the people there seem to be established professionals already- implying that non-professionals might not be able to get in.  in short- soundcloud is probably better for 'noobs' but if you can get into spotify and don't have a problem with soundcloud/non-exclusivity, there doesn't seem to be a downside for using that as well. if you're going to go with the scattershot approach, might as well add bandcamp to the list as well, if you're not pro already, since it gives you a place to sell your works from, even if it doesn't make a lot of money.
