            "answer_text": "For the same reason your are protective of things that mean a great deal to you: Financial attachment. Emotional attachment. Making a living attachment. Common sense attachment. Instruments are expensive. The more expensive they are, the more protective musicians become because replacement or repair is expensive, if not impossible, if they are mishandled, and accidents happen with people who know how to handle them, let alone from those who do not. Being as personal as it is, the relationship a musician has with an instrument is quite personal. I reckon it is the same as someone protecting a baseball glove used by Mickey Mantle. The glove may be worn and tattered but, to the owner there are memories attached. All kinds of personal feelings attach themselves to things people consider important. Musical instruments included, whether new or vintage/antiques with a history. Those who make their living using musical instruments need them for employment. Protection is a matter of practical necessity, plus any of the above. For me, common sense tells me that most people are not going to have the same respect for my instruments as I do and handling them takes on a different dimension for them, even if it\u2019s greasy hands that leave fingerprints all over them. Even if they have much respect, the way they handle things is a matter of personal habit for their own possessions which may be lax. Musicians don\u2019t believe they should have to take that risk.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m glad you asked! Few reasons: They\u2019re fragile. Drop a guitar to the floor and there\u2019s good chance it\u2019ll crack or at least get a few dents. Same with classical instruments like a flute or violin. Which leads to point two\u2026They\u2019re expensive. So you\u2019ve just destroyed your best friend\u2019s 5000\u20ac violin by sending it down a flight of stairs. Sure, you didn\u2019t mean to, but are gonna pay for it? And also\u2026They\u2019re personal. Musicians can get very emotionally attached to their instruments. Over the years we\u2019ve grown accustomed to their feel and know how to get that sweet sound out of them. No two instruments are truly alike, even if there is a same model in existence. For old instruments, and classical instruments especially, there usually isn\u2019t. So if it breaks, it\u2019s game over.We don\u2019t know where your hands have been.So, first wash your hands and then ask for permission to test the instrument. Avoid sudden moves and be very careful. ",
