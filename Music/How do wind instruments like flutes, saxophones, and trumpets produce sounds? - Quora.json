            "answer_text": "Hello Andrew, thanks for the A2A. My answer is the same as those already given. All wind instruments make sound by setting up vibrations in the air going into and through them. With a flute the air is split by the sounding edge setting up waves going down the tube, the note being governed , in simple terms, by the distance from the sounding edge and the tone hole open at the time. With a reed instrument air is blown over a thin wooden/grass edge causing it to vibrate. This vibration travels down the tube\u2026.. With trumpets and similar the vibration is set up by the players lips, basically you are blowing raspberries into the tube but in a more refined way. Once the vibrations are set in motion the notes are produced by combinations of tube length, tube bore, velocity of the air etc. If you have an enquiring mind or suffer from insomnia reading a book by Arthur H. Benade \u2018Fundamentals of musical Acoustics\u2019 should fix the problem. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The sounds of wind instruments are produced by vibrating air. The flute is unique as the vibrating is caused by blowing across the lip plate (like playing a pop bottle.Saxophones and other single reeds are set into motion with the air crossing a piece of thin wood (reed.)All the brass sounds are created by the lips themselves \u201cbuzzing\u201d into the mouthpiece.All of these are contingent by a different formation of the facial muscles or embouchure.",
