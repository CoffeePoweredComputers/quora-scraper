            "answer_text": "I agree with everyone voting Yamaha, however, disagree with some of the model suggestions. A nine year old should be practicing on weighted keys, period. Do not consider anything that isn\u2019t weighted. A nine year old should be practicing on 88 keys, period. Please do not go down to 61, unless you have to. FIRST: The best bang for your buck will be the Yamaha P-105 ($600) or P-155 ($1200). Both will be slightly cheaper if bought used. These are A-Class instruments. I love my 155 and have never played a digital piano in this price range that is as pleasurable to play as it is. They keys are also weighted gradually (GHA). I was willing to spend up to $2500 when I was digital-piano-shopping, yet I decided on the P-155\u2026 because I love it that much. SECOND: If you need to stay under $500, you might consider the Yamaha P-45B ($500). I haven\u2019t played it personally, but I believe it\u2019s a junior version of the above mentioned models, and still boasts the 88 keys and the weighted keys (graded hammer as well). As for the other suggestions, I\u2019m afraid I would not recommend the Piaggero or the 320 (both mentioned already). And the young lady who mentioned the U5, that is an acoustic model. ",

            "answer_text": "I did not want to spend tons of money since I was not sure how the piano would work out for my 7 y/o. So, I bought her a Yamaha:  http://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical-instruments/keyboards/digitalkeyboards/portable_keyboards/ypt-320/?mode=model#tab=product_lineup It was $160, and I checked Craigslist. They sell for about $100 used. Therefore, if she really gets into piano, I can get my money back and upgrade. Or of course if she doesn't like it, I'm pretty well covered too. The keyboard works great and as it turns out, she won't be needing the extra keys for at least 2-3 years. Note: Stand and headphones are extra. ",
