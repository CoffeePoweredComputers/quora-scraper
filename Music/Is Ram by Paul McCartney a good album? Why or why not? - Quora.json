            "answer_text": "This is a question of taste, which means, no one opinion is right, or wrong. For me All Things Must Pass by George Harrison, was an excellent first Album for George, certainly value for money, all those songs. McCarney was below that of All Things Must Pass, by Paul, but Imagine by Lennon, was the best of the Solo Albums, (though George and Ringo did play on it). Ram On, was around the same quality as McCartney, by Paul, a little more risky in places, with comfortable songs. Unfortunately, everything since from those three Beatles, were never going to replace any Album of the Beatles. It is my opinion, and only that. Measured up against other Albums coming out in the 70\u2019s, they were very average, even exceptionally poor in places. The music the Beatles made was Modal, but in a new refreshing way. They cannot be described as a Rock Band, or a Blues Band. The first half of the eight years, was Melodic, beautifully crafted Contemporary Band. The second half was beautifully crafted Melodic, but Riff Based Band. That Beatles Artistic, ground breaking, contemporary, new Pop Music, classic, never dated, is a dead Artistic Endeavour, never to be re-lighted. The pain I feel because it died, is too painful to put into words. I think some projects of George got more interest, Hand Made Films, and the Travelling Wilburys. McCartney has continued with poor, mediocre Albums, and Double Fantasy was better received after John\u2019s murder. Paul McCartney is better doing concerts, he\u2019s got the best back list of songs to choose from. They look like great gigs. Ringo has a Band and Gigging, bless him, John and George are gigging in the sky. The reasons why the Beatles solo careers were never as good as The Beatles, is an interesting question, that NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED. For me, if they never carried on with a Performance career, nothing much would have been lost, just a few nice songs, that\u2019s all. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, \u201cRam\u201d was McCartney\u2019s best album. It went to no. 2 on the American charts (which was probably by all accounts a disappointment), but shows him re-generating after the split of the Beatles and the release of \u201cMcCartney\u201d the year before. In appreciating this record, you need to look at the circumstances for making \u201cMcCartney.\u201d The way I interpret it is that he was freed from the personalities of his former band to make the stripped down record he always wanted. And he did, but it was an artist in retreat. My dad always maintained that \u201cMcCartney\u201d was baffling when it was first released, as it did not have the high production standards that the Beatles\u2019 records had. Now let\u2019s go on to \u201cRam.\u201d It essentially is \u201cMcCartney,\u201d but produced in a professional studio. It had the feel of a homemade record, but not recorded with McCartney as the sole musician in his home studio. The results are masterful, in my opinion, balancing some of the stripped down tracks with some interesting layers of string instruments (\u201cThe Back Seat of My Car\u201d is the best example of such). There\u2019s some mini-suites on here (\u201cMonkberry Moon Delight\u201d and \u201cLong Haired Lady\u201d) that don\u2019t deliberately try to copy the Beatles, but what they\u2019re supposed to mean I wouldn\u2019t know. At least they sound interesting. And that\u2019s what the record is\u2014sound wise, I find it to be amazing; one of the numerous forerunners to lo-fi or indie-pop if you ask me. The stripped down sound that McCartney had intended for the Beatles would be imparted to Wings on this album and \u201cWings Wild Life,\u201d but would run its course by 1972. Time to move on, I suppose. ",
