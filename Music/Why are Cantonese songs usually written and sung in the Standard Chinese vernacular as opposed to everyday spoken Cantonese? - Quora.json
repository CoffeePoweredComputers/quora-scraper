            "answer_text": "The \u201ceveryday spoken Cantonese\u201d you usually hear is actually \u201cthe language of the uneducated\u201d. The lettered Chinese in the old days used Classic Chinese in literature, including in the songs. Classic Chinese is far from modern \u201cspoken Cantonese\u201d. You can still see Cantonese songs using \u201cClassic style\u201d in the 1970s and 80s. Modern Cantonese pop song composers make great efforts to put vernacular Cantonese into pop songs but they eventually realize that if they can\u2019t really part with the traditional culture, it\u2019s not wise to limit themselves with the \u201cspoken Cantonese\u201d. And once you embrace the traditional lettered way to compose lyrics, you will certainly find it different from the \u201ceveryday spoken Cantonese\u201d. Another reason is that the Hong Kong composers care about the Taiwanese market and the mainland market eventually. For that they need to compose songs that can be sung both in Cantonese and Mandarin. If the melody of the song is too \u201cCantonese\u201d, it\u2019s hard to put Mandarin lyrics into it later. ",

            "answer_text": "In the earlier days (I think its somewhere around the 40's & 50's) the most popular songs in HK are mandarin songs. This is a combination of a high percentage of mandarin speakers, low percentage of English speakers and the non-existent of canton pop.Later on, with a generally better level of English skills, English songs start to pick up and replaced mandarin songs. In the 70's, local consciousness began to rise and therefore the people starts to look for Cantonese songs. Because the general public are still mostly barely educated, everyday spoken Cantonese are the easiest to understand and can create resonant. It was the golden age in terms of \"everyday spoken Cantonese songs\".Later in the 80's and 90's, the general public becomes more educated. The education we have received lead us to believe that written Chinese is better than spoken Chinese(Cantonese). Ever since then, Cantonese songs becomes more like written Chinese than spoken Cantonese.So IMO its because of the education we received. ",
