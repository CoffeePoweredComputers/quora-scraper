            "answer_text": "Oh Mercy by Bob Dylan. It\u2019s a fantastic album full of outstanding songs and represented a triumphant return to form after a fairly dismal decade.10\u20131 by Midnight Oil. An incredibly strong set of songs by Australia\u2019s finest and better than anyone, anywhere else in the world was producing at the time. (to be honest there are several other Oils albums that could probably be here but I\u2019ve gone with one just to provide variety)Full Moon Fever by Tom Petty. Free Falling, Running Down a Dream and I Won\u2019t back Down would be enough to get it on a list on their own but the rest of the tracks are fantastic as well.How Will the Wolf Survive by Los Lobos. One of the finest albums recorded by a band who were sadly overlooked too often.Indigo Girls by the Indigo Girls. Closer to Fine is one of the best songs of the eighties. The rest of the album aint bad either.Gretchen Goes to Nebraska by Kings X. Music music I heard music. Music oh oh oh lord. \u2026 I\u2019m off to listen to this now.Surfing with the Alien by Joe Satriani. Jaw dropping guitar skills but impressive songwriting, which is something his legion of imitators usually lack. Always with me Always with you is my favourite waltz of all time.In Step. Stevie Ray Vaughan\u2019s triumphant return after cleaning up and getting his life together. It makes his subsequent death all the more tragic.Appetite for Destruction. Guns and Roses debut is stunning after all these years. They never went near it again but it was amazing the first time.Back in Black by ACDC. Lots of albums from 1980 sound dated and tired by now but Back in Black sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday. That might be because ACDC have been trying to sound like it for almost four decades now but it\u2019s a still an incredibly strong collection of songs.",

            "answer_text": "Lifes Rich Pageant R.E.M.- Simply a great record. Song after song presents a terrific band at the height of its powers. Catholic Boy The Jim Carroll Band- Punk rock using the Keith Richards approach to chording. Mr. Carroll\u2019s status as a poet is strengthened by the rich tapestries he weaves here. Remain In Light Talking Heads- A huge leap forward by a band that was already pretty dang good. All Over the Place Bangles- The best album by an all-girl band of the decade and one of the best disks of the \u201980s period. London Calling The Clash- A two-disk set with no filler. It\u2019s so much better than most punk rock from the era that it transcends its genre and has become one of the great Rock & Roll albums. Oh Mercy Bob Dylan- David Stewart is right. Will the Wolf Survive Los Lobos- He\u2019s right again! My Life in the Bush of Ghosts Brian Eno and David Byrne- Ahead of its time. Still. Harpslinger Carey Bell (Harrington)- An overlooked gem from a harmonica player who worked for both Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon. Here he\u2019s backed up by a seasoned group of terrific blues musicians. Slick as chrome and my favorite blues album of the decade. Lucinda Williams (self-titled 3rd album)- One of America\u2019s great songwriters truly comes into her own here. Song after song is just dynamite. As often happens with someone like Ms. Williams, others had hits with cover versions of several of the songs on this disk. Mary Chapin Carpenter won a Grammy for her version of \u201cPassionate Kisses\u201d in \u201894. The Grammy folks were decent enough to give Lucinda one as well for songwriting. ",
