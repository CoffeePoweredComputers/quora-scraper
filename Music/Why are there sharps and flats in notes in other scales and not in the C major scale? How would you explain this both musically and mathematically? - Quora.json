            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s imagine we\u2019re doing this on a piano so we have a visual metaphor for everything I\u2019m saying. All the notes (black and white) on a piano have equal distance from eachother in terms of frequency, regardless of their colour or position. This is what we call equal temperament. Taking that on board, all musical keys can be given as a set of instructions starting from the root note. For example, when playing a major scale you start from the root note, let\u2019s say C, and go up by either a tone or a semitone each time, and this is what creates the major scale. When playing from C to C on a piano, it just so happens that the pattern of the white keys is designed to make the major scale for you. You go up a tone, up another tone, up a semitone, up a tone again, up a tone, up a tone, and finally up another semitone to reach C again. This can be notated as TTSTTTS. In order to retain this pattern starting from any other note, you have to start using black keys, or sharps and flats to make it work. There is another scale that requires no sharps or flats (accidentals) to play, and this is the A minor scale. The pattern for a minor scale is TSTTSTT. The two scales are inextricably linked, so that playing the same set of notes from two different places can create two entirely different tonalities! One thing I don\u2019t know personally is what decided the pattern of the black keys, or moreover why there is only a semitone from B to C and E to F. I think I need to do some more digging! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s convenient and it\u2019s traditional. The musical notation system is a universal language that musicians use to communicate with each other. Why is it done the way it is? Many people over many hundreds of years made contributions to it, and what is now accepted as the norm was determined by consensus. Some of it has known sources, and other parts of it is lost to history. Is there a better way to do it? Probably, but changing to another system has two major difficulties. Musicians already know the current system and would need retraining to adopt another system. Also, millions of already written songs would have to be translated to it. So why does the key of C have no sharps and flats and the other keys do? I have wondered that, too. If I were naming the keys, I would name the first one A, not C. And I\u2019d start with the key that has no sharps and flats. Well, but there is a key that is named A and has no sharps and flats. It\u2019s called A minor. If you name that key A, then the major key that uses only the white keys will be C. This is all just speculation on my part. I did a search on the internet at one time, but did not find a definitive answer. As far as I know, the reason for which keys were assigned which letters is lost to history. ",
