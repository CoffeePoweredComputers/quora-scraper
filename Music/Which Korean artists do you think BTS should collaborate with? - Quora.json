Their voices would be so sweet on the same track, literal music to my ears. Hopefully in that R&B style Red Velvet sometimes does.DPR LIVE, J-Hope, Maddox, and Jungkook on a track together.Simon Dominic, Flowsik, J-Hope, Suga, and RM. Just hear me out ok? They all have these amazing tones when they rap that would be beautiful together. I\u2019d like to hear them do something similar to Simon Dominics song DAx4.V and SuHyun from AKMU. I think they could make a really good song together!3Racha plus rap line. That\u2019s all.Jin, Hoody, Crush, and Haon all on one song because I\u2019m really curious on how it would go.Giriboy, V, Dean, Suga and RM.Hyuna, Suga, and Jimin because it sound like a good combination!That\u2019s all for now! ~J ",

It would be challenging because Zico (who is one of the most prolific songwriters and producers in KPOP) is incredibly busy as is RM so finding the time might be a challenge. My dream would be to see them collab with Big Bang (who they have long admired - they were their inspiration, along with Epik High, but Tablo already collabed with Suga) - and a BTS/EXO collab would be amazing ",

Gaho has some of the most beautiful producing skills I\u2019ve seen, and he and Taehyung\u2019s voice are both very emotional.
