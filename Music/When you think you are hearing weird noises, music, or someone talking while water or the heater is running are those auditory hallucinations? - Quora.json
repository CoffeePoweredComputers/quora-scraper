In the running water, electric fan, the rain. One time I heard voices of women chanting prayers when the rain was pouring down hard. I was really scared and started panicking that I texted a friend about it. She just told me to pray because she assumed it was something supernatural. I still don't know what causes this. I do experience mild to moderate psychosis including auditory hallucination but I feel like there's somewhat different explanation for these \u201cvoices in the water\u201d. ",
