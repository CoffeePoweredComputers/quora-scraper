Before that , just FYI : In MNCs , the most common ringtones you hear are trademark default ringtones of the mobile companies like : iphone (most common now a days), Lenovo , Motorola , Samsung \u2026It was Nov or Dec 2016, I was in office, doing daily routine work , which included coding, discussions with clients, fight with test team for a defect (yes, I am in IT sector :p ), pressure from management to complete my task, mentor new joiners and blah blah blah\u2026.. and believe me, anyone can get tired and frustrated after 6\u20137 hours of this work. I was also little tired that day, and was almost yelling over phone and was thinking \u201cWhat a messed up life and work I have got\u201d. Suddenly someone\u2019s phone rings up , and it was so loud that almost everyone in office took a time from the work and looked for the phone. Almost everyone either had a smile on their face or were laughing on choice of ringtone, but yes everyone at least smiled (Though 2\u20133 were there who were cursing as they were on call, they can be exempted). And the ringtone was : \u201cLove You Zindagi\u2026. Love You Zindagi \u2026.. !!! \u201d (Link attached) (Zindagi means Life) and then I saw this girl, owner of the phone running and hoping happily (after a long day at work) to pick up the phone (ummm almost like some kid) \u2026 That time I realized , no matter how tiring your day was, no matter if you have messed up at work\u2026 it can be corrected.. If you take life too seriously , then it can take a toll on you\u2026 so keep loving your life, its the most precious thing\u2026 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 * please bare with my grammar and vocabulary * \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- ",
