            "answer_text": "I don't think Ros\u00e9 is not appreciated. In fact, I think the member the least appreciated in Blackpink is Jennie, maybe due to the \u201clazy controversy\u201d and the fact that she's YG's princess. On the opposite, Lisa could be the most appreciated member (must I include that she's my bias so it doesn't help). Not appreciated is, in my opinion a \u201cstrong\u201d word, in the way that people don't know her in person, didn't live with her, they're not her friend nor family member. So they will judge by what they see on stage and on camera, that's why I'm going to tell you what could tick them off. Her voiceI know that she was chosen for her unique voice but the thing is that it may be \u201cunique\u201d but also very harmful. I just know some little things in the music and singing field, but my teacher always told us to breath and sing from the stomach, we had to put our hands on our stomach and feel our diaphragm go up and down. Why do we have to sing with our belly ? For the quite simple reason that if you sing with your throat too much on an extended period, you'll damage your vocal chords and that could be irreversible in the worst cases. But it's also a matter of sound. When you sing using your diaphragm and all, the sound resonate in your body so it creates a more powerful sound \u2013you struggle less to be heard. It's basically feeling you voice in your guts, a cool sensation. But when you sing with your throat, the sound doesn't resonate in your body, only in your head, so it comes off less powerfull and also way more nasally. And I think that's what bother some fans (even me sometimes). Her voice is too nasally and YG emphasize on the fact that \u201cwow her voice is so unique\u201d when that when she is not using it, her voice seems less \u201cstrangled\u201d also when she speaks her voice is a lot different from Blackpink songs. 2. Her acting I'm not criticizing her acting talents. I just want to point out the fact that, the girl group concept is girl crush but it seems that YG thought it's maybe too \u201cbadass\u201d for those young beautiful women, so off in front of camera, they act all cute and all, as if instead of a bunch of young adults, YG picked four girls of elementary school. Some people are born cute, but others act like it and personally, I find it cringy at best. And I think that's why people might not like her, acting cute when she obviously seems like a more laid back woman. 3. Her position Jisoo : Lead vocalist, visual Jennie : Main rapper, vocalist Ros\u00e9 : Main vocalist, Lead dancer Lisa : Main dancer, lead rapper, sub-vocalist You saw it ? Ros\u00e9 is a Main vocalist, picked by YG so she must have talents singing right ?  Well it sounds pinched but she doesn't sing bad. Let's see what it sounds like in a song with her group.  Well damn that sounds good ! She must be pretty talented then ! I'm dying to see how she sounds live with this song !  Okay nevermind. She's not that stable but she seems improving ! If we compare it to the 4D performance. But if she's like that, god the debut live stages should have been horrible !  Girls I swear you're a mystery to me. She is the main vocalist of a well known group who have fans telling that they're super talented. However she doesn't have a super stability, even if they dance but we could expect that they practice a lot since they don't have a lot of comebacks but it seems like they're just slowly improving. But I'm convinced they can do better. However I think that this girl is talented and could be more stable if YG didn't forced her singing with her current voice. 4. Personal preference Sometimes you just can't explain how and why you don't appreciate someone, it's just in the guts. To conclude : In my opinion I think she is one of the more popular in the group, Jisoo is liked a lot by non-blinks but quite underrated still, and Jennie has still shadow upon her figure for various reasons. I think that is she could drop this nasally voice she would be way better on stage and it would be very pleasant to hear, because some people dislike her voice. By the way, here is her voice color she used in this song, that doesn't seems like fake voice singing. And I think in a song with her group it would be very beautiful.  Links might not work. I'll fix the problem later.

            "answer_text": "The only hate I\u2019ve seen is all the bullshit about her voice. \u201cRos\u00e8\u2019s voice is the most unstable in Blackpink\u201d or that she has the worst voice in Blackpink. Some people are just ridiculous bruh. If you\u2019ve heard \u2018Without you\u2019 by G dragon featuring Ros\u00e9, or \u2018If it is you\u2019 cover by Ros\u00e8, she uses a much more deeper and natural voice. That is her oringal given singing voice, she was trained to sing using a different technique for Blackpink that makes her voice sound higher and more \u2018baby\u2019 sounding as people say. YG wanted a \u201cUnique voice\u201d pfttt as if Ros\u00e9\u2019s original voice wasn\u2019t unique but whatever YG. People say the voice YG makes her sing in Blackpink is annoying and nasally. To be honest, it\u2019s all about opinion but for me Ros\u00e9\u2019s voice is fine in Blackpink. I honestly thought that was her original voice before I knew and praised it nonetheless. Gosh this stuff reminds me of the whole Britney Spears thing goodness me. Of course the voice Ros\u00e9 uses in Blackpink, isn\u2019t the healthiest for her, and is a bit unstable but overall it\u2019s still sounds nice. Although I wish YG would let her use her original voice bc it sounds so natural and more comfortable for her, and overall has a soulful sound. I still think the hate on Ros\u00e9 about her vocals should die, she sounds amazing either way. Plus it\u2019s not like she wants to not sing in her original voice, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t use it when she\u2019s singing outside of Blackpink..it\u2019s probably included in her contract. But this is just my opinion anyway. Hope this helped :) ",
