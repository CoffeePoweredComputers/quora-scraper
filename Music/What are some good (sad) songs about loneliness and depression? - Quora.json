            "answer_text": "I first thought of \u2018You\u2019 by Keaton Henson, or anything from his recent albums I suppose - but this music video, too, is just artistic to no end.  Or if this is breakup music you\u2019re after, \u201cSweetheart, What Have You Done To Us\u201d  (The following comes from my experience as a classically versed choral student, but it never fails) To emotionally connect with an audience, let them feel that your volume dynamic is affected by the emotion in your lyrics, tempo, and tone. Let your softs be \u2018intimate\u2019 or \u2018cathartic\u2019 not \u2018quiet\u2019, and your peaks be \u2018aggressive\u2019 but not just loud. Bottom line: change your loudness to trail the mood. Keaton Henson lets me hear the white, faulty breaths close to the microphone, the differences between his \u2018t\u2019 consonants when he\u2019s out of breath, deliberately exposing his smallest faults as a (fantastic) artist. The best word to describe him is \u2018intimate\u2019. ",
