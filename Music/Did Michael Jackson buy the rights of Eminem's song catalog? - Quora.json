            "answer_text": "Yes, that did happen, to my surprise I have to add. Here is an article from 2007. Michael Jackson now owns the rights to Eminem's back catalogue, after his partnership company Sony/ATV purchased the publishing company Famous Music for $370 million. Yesterday's deal means Sony/ATV own the rights to over 125,000 songs, of which Eminem is one of the most high-profile and profitable. In an interesting twist, Jackson once attempted to have the video to Eminem's song Just Lose It taken down because it features the rapper dressed as Jackson and later rapping the words: \"Come here little kiddies on my lap / Guess who's back with a brand new rap / And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child investigation accusate.\" Jackson buys Eminem rights ",
