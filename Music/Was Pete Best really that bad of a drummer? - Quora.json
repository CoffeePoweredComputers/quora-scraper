            "answer_text": "No, Pete was (and last I knew still is) a decent drummer. Why the Beatles replaced Pete with Ringo is one of the questions in Beatles\u2019 history that has lots of plausible answers, some that have nothing to do with Pete\u2019s skills as a drummer. However, some of the plausible answers do focus on the different skills of the two drummers. As best as I\u2019ve been able to piece together, Ringo was something of a perfectionist in his playing while Pete was slacker. Ringo would figure out how an existing drum part was played and copy it exactly. Pete would get the gist of the drum part and play it well enough. Ringo is also said to have been a stickler about keeping time. Pete was more casual about timekeeping, not worrying about speeding up or slowing down a little. Especially later when the Beatles started producing a lot of creatively different songs, Ringo would devise a drum part (sometimes at the advice of McCartney) unique to that song. It\u2019s easy to suspect that Pete would have played those new songs less creatively, relying on standard beats rather than devising new ones. Probably (though who knows) Ringo was even more finicky than Pete about tuning and muffling drums to get the exact sounds he was looking for. Importantly, all these differences between Pete\u2019s and Ringo\u2019s drumming are small, and even added together they don\u2019t amount to a lot. Thus, for example, when George Martin wanted to replace Pete with a session drummer for recording (a common practice) he didn\u2019t intend to have Pete fired. Martin presumably believed that Pete was good enough for live gigs, just best replaced in the studio. Odds are that if the Beatles had not replaced Pete with Ringo, they still would have been superstars, although it would seem that Ringo contributed to their stardom, both with his drumming and probably more importantly his personality. However, McCartney especially, although the other three Beatles also, were pretty particular about the drumming they wanted. They were kind of perfectionists too, and the small differences between Pete\u2019s and Ringo\u2019s playing were things they noticed and cared about. As a result, Pete was eventually replaced with Ringo for musical as well as personality reasons. But none of this means that Pete was a bad drummer. He wasn\u2019t (and as far as I know still isn\u2019t). As someone put it on a drummers\u2019 discussion board though, Pete was really just a decent pub drummer. That\u2019s my sense of his playing too. You\u2019d pay a cover charge to hear a band with him on drums and not be disappointed. His problem was that once the Beatles graduated from being a bar band to a recording and concert enterprise, he wasn\u2019t keeping up with the higher standards. ",

            "answer_text": "By all accounts he was OK, perhaps even good. However Ringo was already well known as the best young professional drummer in the Liverpool music scene. He had plenty of experience as the drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. In fact, the other Beatles considered Ringo an actual \u201cgrown up\u201d professional musician - a status they hadn\u2019t thought they\u2019d achieved yet. There are several reasons given for Pete being replaced by Ringo and I think all contributed to the decision: 1- Ringo was in fact a better drummer and more consistent in terms of keeping time. Pete Best played on the early takes of \u201cLove Me Do\u201d - the Beatles first official recording as signed EMI artists - and George Martin, their producer, was sufficiently displeased with his drumming to bring in a session drummer, Andy White. 2- John, Paul and George are all quoted as saying that Pete didn\u2019t seem to fit in with them that well, personality wise. For example when the other 3 had adopted the \u201cmop top\u201d hair style, Pete Best was still keeping his hair styled more traditionally. 3- Although John, Paul and George deny this, jealousy over his good looks and the amount of attention he was getting from girls may have been at factor. When you see early Beatles pictures, it\u2019s evident that Pete Best was handsome in a James Dean kind of way. One local paper ran an article on the Beatles and noted Pete Best\u2019s \u201cbrooding\u201d good looks. It\u2019s not that the other Beatles were unattractive, but there are reports of Best getting more attention. At one gig Paul McCartney\u2019s father was in attendance and noticed that afterwards many girls ran up to Pete Best, and he admonished him for \u201chogging the spotlight\u201d or something to that effect. He was not only popular among girls - George Harrison sported a black eye from an angry fan after Best was ousted. I suppose it\u2019s possible that a girl threw the punch, but I tend to think it was a guy. So those 3 reasons were all contributing factors. But the most important was almost certainly #1 - Ringo was a better drummer. Paul McCartney tells stories of the times Ringo played with the Beatles (he sat in as a substitute for Best several times before he officially became a Beatle), and says there was a sense that everything just clicked perfectly - better than with Best. So there you have it. ",
