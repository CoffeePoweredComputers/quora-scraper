            "answer_text": "Why is Taylor Swift so popular? Taylor Swift is popular largely because she makes conventional music. Making a conventional sound lowers the risk of alienating listeners. Like Ed Sheeran and others, when listening to her, you can routinely expect an agreeable sound that is designed for top-chart contention. You are yet to be lyrically, topically, or creatively challenged by Taylor Swift.  What makes her different from other female singers in her age group, like Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, and Selena Gomez? I don\u2019t think of Swift as radically different from the three but she is different in that she legitimately has a background as a songwriter. She\u2019s not some mind-bending wordsmith but a hallmark of her records is her lyrical style. When listening to Swift, it\u2019s evident that she draws from real life experiences. Therefore it\u2019s easier for a listener to latch onto her music on a personal level. Contrast with Perry, Grande, and Gomez. Their lyrics seemed very corporate-created, formulaic, and mostly detached from any real-life inspiration. With them, its like lyrics are there just because it\u2019s necessary to make a song.  She appears to have more of following than them. Why? I kind of liken it to someone like Adele, Eminem, Drake, and even 21 Pilots. With each, a bulk of their audience relate to them on a personal level because their lyrics appear to draw from actual inspiration and real life experiences. Swift\u2019s lyrics, for the most part, aren\u2019t programmatic. They\u2019re not just pumped out of the Music Industry Machine. They ostensibly come from a genuine place. And in comparison, her music is more friendly and catchy. Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, and Ariana Grande all make somewhat mature songs related to female sexuality. Songs about seduction, sensuality, and intimacy is more likely to divert listeners than very innocent, saccharine songs about romance and heartbreak.  How can she sell so many albums in the U.S.? The reason is largely for what I said before. Making safe music increases the likelihood of mainstream appeal, and her lyrics have a degree of conviction, which add to the appeal.  What do you think?

            "answer_text": "Taylor Swift is popular because she makes great music and has cultivated an image that appeals to a broad range of people. Taylor got her start in country music, writing simple but catchy songs that everyone can identify with. Starting out in country was smart, because it meant that at a young age, she didn't have to subject herself to appealing to the masses and the pop music industry. She could write and perform the songs she wanted, without having to become a sex symbol, a la Britney and Christina. Her first big hit, Tim McGraw, is just a really good song:  Like the songs she would go on to write, it follows a pretty clear formula: song is (a) about something everyone can relate to (your first love, nostalgia, unrequited love, etc.), (b) has a catchy melody, and (c) has really good lyrics.I actually think the lyrics of her songs are a big reason for her popularity. Taylor Swift is known for writing lyrics that resonate with people. She can capture the range of emotion in something as universal as your first big heartbreak and distill it into a pithy couplet. She uses a lot of precise imagery that gives people an immediate visual / experience they can relate to. This makes her songs specific, relatable, and unique. Some examples:\"All Too Well\" from Red: this is probably the best example, as the song is a sprawling 5 minutes+ dive into a breakup that isn't bitter, but just love that didn't work out. It's something we can all relate to, and she captures these emotions in lines like:\"You call me up again just to break me like a promise / so casually cruel in the name of being honest\": this is just brilliant. The play on the concept of breaking a promise into breaking someone like a promise. And if you've ever had someone try to be \"kind\" to you in a breakup by \"just being honest,\" you know just how casually cruel that can be.\"Cause there we are again in the middle of the night / Dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light\": this captures the memory of love so well. It's such a precise memory - the reference to the refrigerator light is creative and specific, and paints a picture you can see and you understand this is moment she remembers perfectly.\"Our Song\" from Taylor Swift: an example from her first album, about the fun part of young love.\"Our song is the slamming screen door / Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window / When we're on the phone and you talk real slow / 'cause it's late and your mama don't know / Our song is the way you laugh / The first date: 'Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have'\"She's has built up a distinct, strong, and incredibly appealing image:She's cast herself the relatable, best friend you wish you had: she's pretty, but in a girl-next-door kind of way. Many of her songs reference being unpopular (\u201cYou Belong to Me\u201d, \u201cBest Day\u201d), what it's like to be an ordinary teenager (\u201cFifteen\u201d), and staying true to yourself (\u201cMean\u201d). She's totally embraced this image; even now, when she's super popular, she still makes fun of herself (mocking her inability to dance in \u201cShake It Off\u201d; she also talked about this in interviews). She's not a bombshell or goddess like Beyonce \u2014 people worship Beyonce, but no one actually thinks they could be Beyonce. Girls like to think they could be Taylor.She loves her fans. Continuing on the theme of being relatable, she does things that make it clear she loves her fans and wants to be their friends. She threw a release party for people in her apartment (Taylor Swift hosts pizza party for fans at her apartment ) and sent fans Christmas presents (VIDEO: Behind the Scenes of Taylor Swift's 'Swiftmas' Christmas Gift Extravaganza). Her fans eat this stuff up.Her image is based on a real person growing up, dealing with normal things like friendship, love, family, heartbreak, fitting in, building confidence, etc. She's moved at a real pace \u2014 her early songs were very innocent and wholesome. Her songs now are slightly more racy, but that makes sense because she's 25 years old and an adult.She actually acknowledges that she's a role model (see these articles: Taylor Swift Role Model). I think this is a good long-term strategy. In the short-term, being outrageous a la Miley Cyrus can get you notoriety and even popularity, but it's fleeting. Over a long period of time, people want to support someone they can feel good about. Seriously, who doesn't like the message behind \u201cShake It Off\u201d? Plus, all this means parents support her.She's pretty smart and articulate \u2014 see her talking about feminism: Taylor Swift Reveals She Has Been A Feminist All This Time and her op-ed on the music business: For Taylor Swift, the Future of Music Is a Love Story. Also, her recent taking on of Apple on the issue of paying artists was really impressive - very articulate and well-done.Finally, her music is good; to quote a something I saw somewhere: \u201cLife is too short to pretend you don't like catchy Taylor Swift songs.\u201d",
