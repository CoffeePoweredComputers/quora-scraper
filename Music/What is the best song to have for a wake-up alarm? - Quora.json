            "answer_text": "It depends. If you want to suddenly jump vertically in bed in \u201cfight or flight\u201d mode, I\u2019d say \u201cRevolution\u201d by the Beatles. The loud distorted guitar at the start will do the job.If you want to be awakened gradually, you could do a lot worse than \u201cDear Joe\u201d by The Moon Seven Times. The guitar harmonics at the beginning are like church bells in the distance, and the song reaches a low peak towards the end when it modulates to A minor. If you need fortissimo to reach full consciousness, it might not be for you, but I\u2019m going to go see whether I can use a downloaded sound for the alarm on my phone now\u2014I\u2019ve convinced myself.",

            "answer_text": "Trust me, None. Your best song will become the worst song. Anywhere you hear it. You will literally hate it more than cough and cold and a running nose on a busy day. Don't even put your favourite song. If your aim is to just wake up then any loud music will do as long as you do not care about hating the song. Which you will do. (Metal or heavy metal) If you are one of those who get up easily hearing any tone. Go for soft music. Thank you for reading. ",
