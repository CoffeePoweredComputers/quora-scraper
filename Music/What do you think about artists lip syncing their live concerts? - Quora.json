            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of the word \u201csinger\u201d. Singers who record tracks in a studio often get called on to perform on stage. If you\u2019re a Billy Joel or a Tony Bennett, for example, you stand and deliver. Let the young kids jump up and down. You earned your spotlight. If you\u2019re a Bruno Mars or Lady Gaga, however, there\u2019s gonna be some dancing. You got your audience from creating grooves for the dance floor. Dancing takes breathing. So does singing. Which is more important, singing while doing a few quick steps on stage, conserving your oxygen for crushing the vocals, or totally busting a move during the biggest hit of your career? Especially if you\u2019re a singer who dances well, people pay cash money to see the whole experience. Not only does the audience want it to sound \u201cjust like the record\u201d, they want it to look \u201cjust like the video\u201d. No edits, no take 3 or 4, no pauses in between takes to drink water or dab sweat off the forehead. They want it all, right then and there. What to do? If it\u2019s staged right, and given enough creative effort, a lip-sync is a good illusion of a performance. Watching an illusion is an entertaining experience. People go to movies all the time, and none of what we see actually happened. It\u2019s like a magician\u2019s act \u2014 does anyone actually want to see a lady sawed in half? The actual event would be a crime, and any woman who was treated that way would die. But the illusion is remarkable. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only speak for rock musicians. It\u2019s a trend that seems to be growing and i think it\u2019s very harmful. I think that audiences should keep a close eye (and ear) out of this and make sure that bands make the effort of playing live. I recently wrote an article about this matter. [1] Here are some of the reasons why I think bands choose to lipsync, although I do not agree with their motivation: Their abilities to play and, especially, sing, are not what they used to be and they feel they need to enhance their soundThe sound fans are used to is much bigger, using numerous instruments, and rather than adding additional instruments, they add tracksA singer employs a backing band that is not up to snuff with the music (although is is more rare)If the performance is taped, the organizers wish to ensure that there are no errors.The band is experimenting with pre-existing sounds and adding them to their own music. This one is, actually, somewhat defend-able.These are the main things that I\u2019ve found. There are numerous rumors about bands, especially, older ones using this. My hope is that audiences demand that this stop and that musicians offer the audiences actual, live music. Footnotes[1] Let's agree that bands lipsyncing to backing tracks is unacceptable | Alt77",
