            "answer_text": "Yes, we write songs without the use of autotune. Let\u2019s understand: autotune is a recording device, for recording songs. Before one can use autotune, a song must be created first. For instance, auto-spell helps writers spell correctly, but before one can check their spelling, one must choose the words to be checked. In other words, before you can check your homework, you have to do your homework. Autotune was invented, I believe, by a producer with perfect pitch, who could no longer tolerate singers or players who could not stay in tune. I believe that autotune has become a trendy term for producers and critics to use (replacing \u2018pitchy\u2019, perhaps) to describe a recording or performance- a term describing a process that very few listeners could identify. Many famous performers of the past had occasional pitch problems. It is my feeling that autotune is a new toy for engineers and producers and, like all new toys, it has been used and overused and misused by the overzealous. As a jazz musician, I focus on the spontaneity, the immediacy of the music. Have I sung/recorded music where a note was out of tune? Yes, of course. Do I wish I had the option of auto tuning? Absolutely not. Perfect pitch is overrated in individual musical performance. Tone, timbre, attack, vibrato and several other devices are involved in creating a note, to create a sound, a mood, a feeling. Pitch is important, but it\u2019s not the only element of music- those who focus on one part instead of the entire sound miss the point. In an ideal world, singers and players would train themselves to improve their musicianship- then we\u2019d be discussing their skill and their artistic choices, not their technical shortcuts. My stance on autotune is: \u201cJust because we can doesn\u2019t mean we should\u201d\u2026 ",
