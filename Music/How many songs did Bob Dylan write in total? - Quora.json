A lot of his songs have thousands [ slight exaggeration for effect ] of verses . Whatever number you find satisfies the question . Double it . He wrote songs that most people would have tried to get 15 songs out of . He wrote stories too ! Opuses . Illiads . Not a lot of pop bubblegum \u201c I love you , why don\u2019t you love me \u201c stuff . ",
