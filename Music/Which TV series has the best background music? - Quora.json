            "answer_text": "Cold Case, which ran on CBS from 2003 to 2010. Each episode made extensive use of era-appropriate music for flashbacks to the year in question. Some episodes contain music only from one artist such as Ray Charles, U2, Radiohead, Bruce Springsteen, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, The Doors, John Mellencamp, Johnny Cash, Bob Seger, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd, Tim McGraw, Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra and John Lennon. Pearl Jam's music was used in the two-part season-six finale, the first time one artist's music has been used for two full episodes. In one episode, the music from the movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show (\"Creatures of the Night\" starring Barry Bostwick) and in another episode (\"Wilkommen\") only music from Cabaretwas used. In the series finale, music from The Rolling Stones was used, and for the first time, it featured an unreleased song. Source: Cold Case - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I think anime has the best soundtracks than any type of show out there. Especially with series like Your Lie in April, March Comes in Like a Lion, and Shonen Maid. Not only are all three of these series beautifully made (both story & animation), but the soundtracks are breathtaking. <3 ",
