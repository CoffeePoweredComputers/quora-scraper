            "answer_text": "Glenn Frey has said that the album was the very top of the peak for the Eagles but also marked the beginning of the band\u2019s end. There was nowhere left for the group to go as a unit after such a huge success. Released in 1976 the group\u2019s fifth album sold 16 million copies in the United States and more than 30 million worldwide. Interestingly, Frey and Don Henley and the other Eagles have given different answers to what the title track was about. Depending on who you believe, the song was about a freaky, haunted hotel or the jaw dropping excesses and wild lifestyle of the band in its earlier years. It could be it\u2019s about both. Frey once conceded that not even he or the others really know. Oddly enough, Frey told a BBC interviewer that the original working title of the song was, \u201cMexican Reggae.\u201d As for the age-old question about whether the Hotel California was or is a real place. Some have said it\u2019s in Todos Santos, in Baja, California. Henley has said it doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a real place. It\u2019s fun to speculate. But in the end, all that really matters is the music itself\u2014an album that is a pure work of art and one of the greatest rock \u2019n roll creations ever. Now, please bring me my wine.

            "answer_text": "About a year ago, I listened to an interview with Don Henley from the Eagles who wrote the song while in Southern California. I remember him mentioning being in Malibu at the time. It is about the excesses of a place, the California lifestyle, of being famous and living there (Hotel California) and all that goes along with that. Fame, money, luxury (Mercedes Benz and Tiffany twisted), partying, etc. He mentioned how the band members were not from the West coast (Don Henley from a small Texas town, Glenn Frey from Michigan, etc) and when you move out to (Hotel) California from a much simpler upbringing and in to that excess, you can really \u201cnever leave\u201d it behind. It changes you for good. He said \u201cSteely knives\u201c was a nod to the band Steely Dan. They were getting them back for something they did.  The sound as he described was a \u201cMexican Reggae\u201d, Rock and Roll. There is a Hotel California in Baja, California but it appears that it has no connection and a coincidence. ",
