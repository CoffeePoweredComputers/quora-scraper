            "answer_text": "Were they ever? I\u2019ve never seen them live. I actually stopped going to stadium concerts when I was like 15\u2026 most of the bands I tend to listen to play in bars or sometimes larger clubs. Punk bands, folk performers, noise and electronic and even some metal bands. And some rock bands. I want to be a part of the concert, not witness it from 100 yards away, and you can\u2019t do that in a stadium. But I do enjoy listening to live music albums. Some of my favorite albums by some of my favorite bands are the live ones. I must own 20 live bootlegs of The Velvet Underground. Many musicians\u2026 from Led Zeppelin to Pigface to Ani DiFranco to Guitar Wolf to Oingo Boingo to Moby\u2026 are better live than in the studio. They get to improvise, they get to capture the energy of their music in a way no one ever could under artificial settings like a studio. I suppose I\u2019m dating myself. I can\u2019t speak much for musicians who debuted over the past 10 years. I do like the Rolling Stones. I have favorite albums (Let It Bleed, Undercover, Flowers) and favorite songs (2000 Man, Gimme Shelter, Stray Cat Blues.) But their live albums? Listen to Jumpin\u2019 Jack Flash from Get Yer Ya-Yas Out. They somehow make it sound less energetic and less rebellious than the vinyl version. How do they do that?  Still Life was another waste, in my humble opinion. A collection of half-hearted live renditions of studio songs that come off more like the mechanical performance of someone performing a job duty\u2026 not a live expression of art.  Love You Live, Flashpoint\u2026 more and more of the same. Lower sound quality versions of the studio recordings, nothing more. Now, compare those albums to The Velvet Underground Live 1969, Lou Reed Rock and Roll Animal or Led Zeppelin The Song Remains the Same. Every single song on every one of those albums is either more energetic, extended or arranged into an entirely different song. They are simply more interesting. Again, I\u2019m not knocking the Rolling Stones. I think, at one point or another in my life, I\u2019ve owned every Rolling Stones album up to and including Flashpoint. Their live ones were always underwhelming. I think the only one I actually liked was Got Live if You Want It. Maybe because that was early in their career, before they started thinking of the band as a job.  Now, that\u2019s energy. That\u2019s punk. 8 D ",

Mick\u2019s been living a healthy lifestyle since at least the early \u201880s\u2014I saw a photo of him running seven miles barefoot on the beach in The Runner magazine back then\u2014and Ronnie\u2019s been sober for a decade as I write this and probably living a healthy lifestyle as well. Mick and Ronnie had tons of energy onstage. Keith was a little feeble. Charlie was Charlie: a rock. So, yes, Virginia, they are still good live, and they might even be better than their unsober, \u201csloppy\u201d years. ",
