            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by great. To me it means epic (like Bohemian Rhapsody) so I will recommend some to you. X-Japan - Art of Life. 29 minutes long but a classic symphonic metal piece.Versailles - Faith & Decision. 17 minutes long symphonic metal piece but never a boring second. (also a sad song written for their bass player who passed away)Galneryus- Angel of Salvation. 10+ minutes long (from memory) symphonic metal piece. Not my favourite personally but many people love it.Special mention: Vinushka by Dir En Grey. They are a creepy progressive metal band but this 10 minute song is probably their greatest piece thus far imo, if you\u2019re into extreme genres of metal its great to check out but otherwise it might be too much for you (both musically and a deep subject) so best to avoid it. Though its not a heavy song. ",
