            "answer_text": "I've been seeing some ARMYs saying Idol is just another diss track or Mic Drop Pt2. Well it's not. Idol isn't a diss track but a song with the message of loving yourself. Diss track is only meant for their haters but this song is about every single person including their fans who keep judging them for their every little action on everyday basis. In the video,Namjoon and Taehyung did exactly opposite to their fans' liking. ARMYs and BTS have a close bond but that doesn't mean they can't do something that fans wouldn't want them to. After all, they are people. They too have their likes and dislikes and yes they've always put ARMYs choices before theirs but that doesn't mean they can't put themselves first sometimes. So the first step of loving yourself is putting yourself first in your priority list. Next, in Jungkook's small rap, he say how there are 100s of different versions of himself. However, he can only show a single version of himself in front of the camera so as not to be judged by people. This is what idols' lives are. They can't eat as much as they want to, they can't take a break whenever they want to, they can't date. It's like their feelings are manipulated as well. They can't be humans and if they make a single mistake, that is going to haunt them for weeks. Just like every other idol, Jungkook too is unable to show his true self to the people with the fear of being criticised. With this point, they're talking about the fact that people should stop trying to fit in someone's else's shoes and start embracing their true selves. That's the next step of loving yourself. When BTS debuted, they had no idea how much success they'll achieve. They constantly tried to please the few fans they had. Jimin was bashed for his weight, Jungkook for his acne, Namjoon for his looks. Criticism is what they always had on their plates. But in those days, they took them seriously and that affected them in many ways. Jimin went through a strict diet that had a bad effect on his health, Jungkook kept himself from social media because of these stuffs and so on. Now, they're more successful than any musical band from their country could ever be. However, with fame came hate. People started criticising them for their changed behavior, controversies regarding a t-shirt, accusations of becoming too westernized and forgetting their roots. They've realized no matter how hard you try, you can't run away from critisims, neither can your success shut them down. So why bother? People shouldn't bother about situations they can't change. Instead, they should bring changes where they can. Just like that every person in the society is criticised for one thing or another. However people shouldn't be affected by them and instead be themselves and be happy about yourself. That's how you can find mental peace. Lastly, just like they said \u201c you can't stop me loving myself\u201d, everyone should learn to love themselves despite all the hate and criticism they receive because that way we can truly lead a happy life. Be the master of your own world and don't let negativities affect you. Now, that way my interpretation of the song. Hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "i recently watched a video on this, and now it makes more sense\u2026 but to explain it, we will have to look at the lyrics. You can call me artistYou can call me idol so i guess, this is pretty simple, but as they say YOU call me artist. that means that these are all the names other people have come up for them. No matter what you call meI don\u2019t care this just supports what i had written earlier\u2026 I\u2019m proud of itI\u2019m freeNo more ironyCuz I was always just me so, this is just simple, they\u2019re saying, we were what we were, you gave us names and we couldn\u2019t care less, but we were always as we were. They point fingers at meBut I don\u2019t care at allWhatever the reason for your criticism is Suga\u2019s rap, we all know, that he shows that he doesn\u2019t care about taunts on him, so, in other words he is telling all the haters just don\u2019t waste your time worrying about me, cuz\u2019 i just don\u2019t care. I know what I amI know what I wantI never gon\u2019 changeI never gon\u2019 trade(Trade off) RM always says that find yourself, and now he\u2019s again talking to the haters and everyone who tries to shape him into something he isn\u2019t\u2026 because he knows, what he is, and how how wants he lives and stuff\u2026 Keep on chit-chatting, saying this and thatTalkin talkin talkinI do what I do, so you do youDirty dirtyYou can\u2019t stop me lovin\u2019 myself basically, here,they\u2019re saying that hen you can do what you want then why can\u2019t I? and when i do, you talk, but still all this dirty talk can\u2019t stop me being myself hence loving myself. Ulssu\u00b9, I like itYou can\u2019t stop me lovin\u2019 myselfI like the shoutsYou can\u2019t stop me lovin\u2019 myself OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHDunkiduk kungduruhruh\u00b2Ulssu OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHDunkiduk kungduruhruhUlssu the rest is just how awesome everything is, when you are free\u2026 and being yourself. Face Off, like John Woo, ayTop star with that spotlight, aySometimes like a super heroI\u2019m your Anpanman24 hours isn\u2019t enoughCan\u2019t afford to be confusedI do my thangI love myself so, John Woo is considered a big influence on the action genre, and his action productions and stuff, so they\u2019re really just, not comparing, telling how much they can do, by mentioning a big personality. and trust me, BTS\u2019s songs are like superheroes, so yeah\u2026 and that Anpanman thingy, you might know that they have a whole song with it\u2019s whole background, but just know, Anpanman, was a superhero, who helped the needy and in a way, BTS is helping us by giving us their music. they rest is how much work they do, and stuff\u2026 I love myself, I love my fansLove my dance and my whatThere are hundreds of me\u2019s inside of meI\u2019m facing a new me again todayIt\u2019s all me anywaySo instead of worrying, I\u2019m just gonna runRunnin\u2019 manRunnin\u2019 manRunnin\u2019 man so, that\u2019s the Jungkook scene right? the\u2019re are A LOT of masked people in the room with him. many people would say, that they don\u2019t have people looking like Jungkook that\u2019s why he\u2019s masked but they can easily edit that, in my opinion, masks represent, hiding something, hiding in yourself, and as the line goes, that they\u2019re a hundred me\u2019s inside me. so he finds a new personality, a new trait everyday, and he isn\u2019t ashamed to embrace, but because of the people he has to mask them, but then he realizes that they\u2019re all him, so nothing to be ashamed of. haters can go hide themselves but our kookie won\u2019t. then there\u2019s the Taehyung scene, people are basically attacking him, and he says, that because of what i am, people attack me with questions, and accusations, so instead of worrying i will leave because it\u2019s not really my responsibility to solve other people\u2019s worries. in other words, i don\u2019t care what you think skipping the part, where they\u2019re all happy\u2026 I\u2019m so fine wherever I goEven if it takes a while sometimesIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m in love with my-my myselfIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m happy in this moment so, they\u2019re saying that they can adapt to the environment/ situation they\u2019re in but sometimes it takes time. but no biggie! you can make mistakes and that\u2019s me too\u2026 in other words, you love yourself, when you be yourself and being yourself is nothing to be ashamed of. no matter what others say, they are just here to let you down.
