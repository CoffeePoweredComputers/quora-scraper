            "answer_text": "There are a lot of great tools out there. From tools to help you make videos to tools to help you promote your videos, using the right tools will help you increase your organic viewership. And the more organic views you have, the more potential subscribers you can get. Use the keyword in the title. This had a larger impact on SEO in the past, but it still has a pretty large effect on video. Google crawlers don\u2019t watch videos the way they read blog posts, so putting the keyword in the title will let Google bots know what your video is all about.Use Google Adwords to identify what people are searching for on the web. Try to tackle videos with a perfect blend of high volume searches and low competition.Don\u2019t make the title too long. Google truncates the length of the video down to 66 characters and adds \u2018YouTube |\u2019 before the video (taking an extra 10 characters). Your ideal video title should be no more than 50 characters.For me, I have been using Instant Views for a while & I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about YouTube marketing.Your videos and channel may be temporarily published on blogs and exchanges until you receive the number of views, subs, likes or comments you ordered.
