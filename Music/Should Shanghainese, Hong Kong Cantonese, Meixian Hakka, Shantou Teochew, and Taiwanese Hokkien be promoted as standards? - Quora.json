            "answer_text": "The question is \"Should Shantou Teochew be promoted as standard?\"  In the 9 provinces of East Guangdong Province, known as ChaoShan - Chao comes from ChaoZhou and Shan comes from Shantou - Shantou Teochew is promoted as standard and therefore the Teochew PinYin, given by the authorities are written in Shantou Teochew.   I am so lucky that my family speaks Shantou Teochew and I can therefore identify with the romanisation of Teochew.  In my newest dictionary by Zhang XiaoShan, he also gives Teochew pronunciation as well, in addition to Shantou Teochew. However, when I watch films or dramas from East Guangdong province, some of the actors would speak in DioZiu Ue \u6f6e\u6d32\u8a71 and some in Swatow Ue \u6c55\u982d\u8a71.  As my mother is Teochew and my father is from Swatow, I am able to follow what the actors are saying. Teochew City is our historic city and most of us living overseas identify ourselves as Teochew. I hope that the Teochew language will not die out and I notice many wonderful Teochew videos on-line and I think this resource will help to keep the language alive for those who like learning it. Thank you for reading this post.  ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know much about Hakka or Teochew but I think Taiwanese Hokkien has been fairly standardized, definitely promoted and now included in elementary school curriculum alongside the \u201cNational Language (Guoyu = Mandarin)\u201d. When foreigners learn Cantonese especially outside of Mainland China, many books and their recordings are usually in Hong Kong Cantonese. When Wu Chinese is taught, most books teach the Shanghai dialect (\u4e0a\u6d77\u8bdd). ",
