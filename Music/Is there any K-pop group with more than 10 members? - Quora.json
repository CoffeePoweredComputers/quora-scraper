            "answer_text": "In fact, off the top of my head, I can easily name 5 or 6 groups with more than 10 members. NCT   (Hendery, Yangyang, Xiaojun respectively in the last picture) Nct currently has 21 members and is under SM entertainment label. The first subunit debuted in April 2016. Their latest one debuted in China early this year (2019) (One of my personal favorite kpop groups if I'm being honest). All the members have their subunit which currently consists of NCT 127, NCT Dream, WAYV, and the currently inactive NCT U. They have a very unique style of having UNLIMITED members, meaning that there will always be new members added on until SM decides that enough is enough and there needs to be another group (lol) If you are an NCT fan, you are an NCTzen, meaning that you are a citizen of NCT. Their official color is green. Seventeen  (From left to right Back Row: Jun, The8, Hoshi, Seungkwan, Middle Row: Jeonghan, Wonwoo, Mingyu, Dino, S.Coups, Woozi and Front Row: Vernon, Joshua, DK (credits to Keira Spurrell :)) ) ) Seventeen has 13 members and debuted in May 2015 under Pledis Entertainment. Like many other groups, the members can be split into subunits where they specialize in their own style. For example, in Seventeen, there is the'Hip-Hop Unit', 'Vocal Unit', and 'Performance Unit.' If you are a Seventeen fan, you are a carat. (Not carrot, i had this mixed up for weeks lol) Wanna One  (Once again, dont know the names. Sorry to all the Wannables out there :( Leave the names in order and in the comments and ill credit u :)) Wanna One is a very special group. It was formed by the top 11 contestants from the second season of Produce 101. The group debuted in August 2017, under YMC Entertainment. On May 31, Wanna One announced they\u2019re moving agencies to Swing Entertainment. Unfortunately, Wanna One officially disbanded on December 31, 2018. If you are a Wanna One fan, you are a Wannable :)) Super Junior  (Once again, dont know the names. :( Leave the names in order and in the comments and ill credit u :)) Super Junior, another group from SM Entertainment, debuted in November 2005. They have many subunits, like Super Junior K.R.Y, Super Junior T, Super Junior M, Super Junior H, and Super Junior D&E. Personally, this is another one of my favorites because their music is so catchy but brings back first generation kpop style vibes (I was born during the second generation though lol ) If you are a Super Junior Fan, you are an ELF, meaning Everlasting Friends (Such a cute fandom name isn't it??) Finally, the best for the last\u2026.. (My opinion please don\u2019t bash me :(( ) EXO <3 <3 <3  (\u201cFirst Row\u201d Chanyeol Lay Suho Luhan Xiumin\u201cSecond Row\u201d Sehun Kai Chen Tao DO Baekhyun, and Kris behind Kai) Exo is one of my top 3 kpop bands and this is a sad one for me to write about because unfortunately, 3 left so I wasn\u2019t sure whether this counted but when I was researching, I found that they often referenced EXO with 12 members so I am personally very happy to put them here. They Debuted in 2012 with 12 members, split into EXO M and EXO K. In 2014, Kris filed a lawsuit against SM for unfair treatment between the Chinese members and the Korean, and a few months later, Luhan followed. Finally, in 2015, Tao left EXO and now we are left with the 9 that will forever stay together. After the three left, EXO united to become one whole group that promoted together until Lay was forcibly not allowed to because of the politics between Korea and China. In 2016, another subunit was formed, called EXO-CBX. Exo\u2019s fans are called EXO-L\u2019s, because L is in the middle of K and M (their subunits) and L stands for love. I would post more groups except I don\u2019t have the time (I have finals lol) Anyway, there are many more but I hope you enjoyed! -RX ",
