The Psilocybin Chronicles by MycoMeditations (Links to all podcast directories in the link once you scroll down a bit^) In it we interview guests and people who work as facilitators/therapists at our psilocybin mushroom retreat in Jamaica. People come down for a week and have amazing experiences which unpack so much trauma and suffering that has made them depressed, anxious, addicted to alcohol, given them PTSD, etc. We share their transformations and talk about how psilocybin mushrooms have a huge role in the way we can heal and grow ourselves and our society at large.
