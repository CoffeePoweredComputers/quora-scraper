            "answer_text": "Personally, I like some pop-styled music (mostly by Jeff Williams), but I turn to power metal and alt/hard rock for quality content. Songs like \u201cBlood of Bannockburn\u201d or \u201cInmate 4859\u201d by Sabaton tell me the stories of great men and soldiers. Of fantastically fatal final stands and the courageous actions of individual soldiers. Example: 5th of may, V day is just around the corner1945 the F\u00fchrer reign is at it\u2019s end Jenny at the gates, as the SS open fireThere\u00b4s no time to waste, the final battle has begun After the downfall, a castle besiegedFacing the nazis awaiting reliefGangl and Lee and their men set the prisoners free An it\u2019s the end of the line of the final journeyEnemies leaving the pastAnd it\u2019s American troops and the German armyJoining together at last (The Last Battle, Sabaton) I also listen to bands like Disturbed because they have many thought provoking lyrics such as in \u201cLegion of Monsters.\u201d Disturbed deals with quite a few political and moral problems. They've written songs about racial prejudices as well as how the media can encourage a future mass murder. A father's pride, my son walking beside meI look around and marvel how the children playIn perfect disarray (So innocent)No judgement, pure exhilarationBlack to white, the colors aren't on their mindsNothing predefined (All different)There's always one who plants an evil seed andPreaches fear to pull you to the other sideInto a world of lies (Who Taught you how to Hate, Disturbed) The pop genre is just so much of a sex-drugs-swag scene it makes me sick. I can\u2019t understand why people actually like a song where the singer is essentially asking a girl to be his slut! (Shape of You, Ed Sheeran) ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018Do most people don\u2019t\u2019 I like that construction. I might start using it. Uhm. Pop music. I think virtually everyone likes it when they're young, but with maturity comes the realization that most of it is banal and musically impoverished. That's fine though, and how it should be. Pop music is a fun, exciting, superficial and transient phenomenon. The problem is - it hangs around too long. If Pop has a central place in your life when you're an adolescent, that's cool and absolutely normal. You should enjoy the fun. If Pop still has a central place in your life after, say, forty, then you're in a state of arrested development. There are worse crimes. If you're going to develop a deep, mature love of music, then Pop is the nursery slopes. It can be huge fun but at some point you need to grow up and move on to something more challenging and rewarding. As I said, Pop Music lasts too long. It hangs around forever and stinks out the place. I remember vividly hearing Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen for the first time in 1976. Although I was quite the adolescent music snob, with a deep passion for The Velvet Underground, I loved it. I could feel the excitement as this wonderfully crafted song swept everything and everyone along in its glorious camp wake. Now, some forty odd years later, I can't get any pleasure out of it. God knows how many hundreds if not thousands of times I have heard it since 1976. The only pleasure I can suck out of its dessicated corpse is a memory of how I liked it once. It's not pleasure. It's a memory of pleasure. I don't know how old you are but the main problem is that pop music is too superficial to give any sustained pleasure. I had no idea that pop music would hang around for so long. Dancing Queen is great but 43 years later I can't derive any more pleasure from it. The thought that it might be played at weddings in 100 years time is dispiriting. It's only a silly pop song. It shouldn't still be around. There is some consolation in knowing that I won't be. I can remember when Penny Lane, as another example, was in the charts. I was far too young to articulate my recognition that it was different from music I had heard before, but I can still catch a ghost of a fleeting memory of a wonderfully creative time in British cultural history. Now? I can't listen to it unless I take a twenty year rest. No music can sustain repeated hearings week after week, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, and so on. Actually, that's not true, there is music that is interesting enough to have longevity, but you wouldn't call it pop music. Pop music was a huge part of my youth but it hangs around too long. Imagine someone told you a joke and you loved it. Imagine, an hour later, they came and told you the same joke again. Then an hour after that - same joke. Imagine that happened for 40 years. That's pop music. Just hang around long enough and you'll realize why old fogies ask for it to be turned down in public. They've been listening to it for a very long time, and it doesn't bear repeated listening. ",
