            "answer_text": "Veganism is the ethical stance against animal cruelty. As soon as people make it about themselves, it\u2019s plantbased. Miley used to be very outspoken about animal rights but now claims her brain wasn\u2019t doing well on a plantbased diet. Instead of realizing she should probably lay off the recreational drugs and maybe look into nutritional advice (with those millions in the bank, she could hire a personal vegan nutrition coach and a chef and afford the freshest ingredients \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) she\u2019s gone back to eating animals as the easy way out. It leads me to believe she\u2019s never been a true vegan but only plantbased. She\u2019s made a right fool of herself with this move and I cannot roll my eyes back far enough to express my feelings about it. ",

She doesn\u2019t eat red meat for Allergy. But she called herself vegan. There were one vegan YouTube celebrity who got caught recently eating fish. Lots of fake vegans. Only want attention. ",
