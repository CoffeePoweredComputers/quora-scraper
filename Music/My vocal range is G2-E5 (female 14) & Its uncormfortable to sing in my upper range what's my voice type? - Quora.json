            "answer_text": "If I were talking to an adult, vocally trained woman, I\u2019d say this is contralto range, and I\u2019d quickly make a wish because they are rare as hell. HOWEVER, you\u2019re a teenager. It\u2019s a misconception that girls\u2019 voice doesn\u2019t drop. It just drops less than boys\u2019 and the period of adjustment is shorter, that\u2019s why women can start singing seriously earlier than men (and why most young singers\u2019 programmes have a limit at 30 for women and at 35 for men). Depending on how low your pre-puberty voice was and when you started undergoing puberty, you may still be adjusting to your new voice. In my conservatory, you couldn\u2019t start taking singing lessons before 16, which is a very sensible limit (that is, until they changed the teacher and the new one decided she didn\u2019t mind having 14-year-olds destroying their voices trying to sing roles ten times their size). As well, without some training, even if it\u2019s just by singing in a choir, it\u2019s very difficult for you to make most of your voice. For what I know, you may have a full octave left to \u2018unlock\u2019 once you learn to effectively access your head voice to produce a full sound. So basically, if you were to join a choir I\u2019d put you in the alto section (or 3rd voice in a girls\u2019 choir) but knowing that your range will change over time. And if it turns out you\u2019re a true contralto, great for you! Go ahead, study music and you won\u2019t have employment problems. ",

            "answer_text": "With all this, I'm assuming middle c is c4 Judging on how low you can sing, I would say you are an alto. If it's uncomfortable to sing in your upper range, you might want to check your technique. Make sure to have a good posture (feet shoulder width apart and standing/sitting up straight), take deep breaths, drop your jaw, and keep your head center (no tilting forward or back). E5 shouldn't be too strenuous for most girls, so these tips should help. There could also be the case that you have an unusually low voice for a girl, in which case, congrats! If none of these tips help, then take a lesson with a professional vocal coach as they have seen it all. Hope this helps! ",
