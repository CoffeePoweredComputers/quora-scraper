            "answer_text": "From \"U2 Into The Heart: The Stories Behind Every Song\" by Niall Stokes. ...It is extraordinary to think just how close 'One' came to not happening. Given the shambolic and often haphazard way in which U2 operate in the studio, there's always a sense that songs are written by accident, but this was a particularly extreme case. And yet it emerges as one of their finest creations, a ballad of great depth and beauty that's open to a multiplicity of interpretations. \"I think it was based loosely on the position I was in regarding my last girlfriend and my wife,\" Bono's old Lypton Village associate, Guggi, reflects, offering one interpretation... 'One is a song about relationships. The implication of guilt, felt by someone who has just walked out on a longterm love, is there alright when Bono asks, \"Have you come here for forgiveness/Have you come to raise the dead/Have you come here to play Jesus/To the lepers in your head?\" But the song is also a mediation on the extent to which their Berlin sojourn was testing the band's own sense of unity. \"that's an extraordinary thing about songwriting,\" Bono relates. \"what something is in essence, you don't have to play to it. In fact if you play against it, you often get much more.\"'One', of course, is about the band,\" he adds. \"have you seen the 'Live at Sydney' film? It was after Adam flipped out in Sydney, and we'd had to do a show without him. We had just two nights to film, and the first was gone because he wasn't there. So we had one night to get it and we knew he was in a bad way. But he looks amazing tin the film and there's a real boldness to his playing, against the odds. I don't know how he kept it together...\" 3 videos were made for 'One', each drawing on a different interpretation of the song. One, directed by Mark Pellington and built around an image of buffalo being herded over the side of a cliff, was based on the work of the artist David Wojnarowicz, who had dies of an AIDS-related illness in 1992. It led to speculation that 'One' was a song about AIDS and that the lyric represents a conversation between a father and his HIV-positive gay son. It always seemed like a somewhat liberal interpretation to me. [End book quote] Bono goes on to be quoted that there is indeed a sexuality level within the song, and phrases that have to do with confusion, infidelity, or abandonment. ",

            "answer_text": "Bill Flanagan interprets the song as about the band reconciling. Flanagan was present while U2 was struggling to record Achtung Baby. As he tells it, Bono and the Edge had one idea of what the album should be, while Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr had a different idea. They were still arguing when, finally, they composed \"One.\" And after that (according to Mr. Flanagan) the band had a private meeting wherein they decided to bury their creative differences and agree. As Pete Tyson has noted, the song can have other meanings as well.I would guess it means different things to Bono at different times. The song takes on another meaning in the version where Mary J. Blige (musician) sings. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s about difficult relationships. On one level it\u2019s partners, the pair is one, but each individual is one. It\u2019s about balancing that. But It\u2019s also about a parent child relationship and the problems of a generation gap between them, and the growing fraction with that family unit. But It\u2019s also about U2, who were having problems between the four members on direction and musicality. The friction within the band was tearing it up, but they wanted to keep the band as a single unit. All scenarios are similar, although obviously there are differences. Perhaps this is why there are three videos. I imagine it\u2019s possible to come up with different scenarios as well. Like most songs, different interpretations are not necessarily wrong. ",
