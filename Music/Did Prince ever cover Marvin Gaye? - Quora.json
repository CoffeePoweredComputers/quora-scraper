            "answer_text": "I think Prince hated song covers when they added nothing interesting or new to the song. But then again, I cannot speak for him. I am not aware if he ever covered a Marvin Gaye song in concert. He did cover Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground) by The Jacksons in concert. This song has a chorus highly influenced by Marvin Gaye\u2019s song Got to Give It Up. ",

            "answer_text": "Marvin Gaye had such a profound influence on the R&B and pop artists that came after him, it would be surprise if Prince had not covered a Marvin Gaye song sometime during his career. However, Prince has said that he did not record covers. He may have done covers in concert performances, but he said that he never did covers in recordings. ",
