            "answer_text": "I do, I actually know a few bands from the Pacific Northwest that can be labeled as \u2018Grunge\u2019, and I am also a solo \u2018Grunge\u2019 artist (Justin M. Wilsey). The thing about \u2018Grunge\u2019 is it just a corporate label invented to pile all bands from PNW. For example Alice in Chains, Mudhoney, Melvins, Screaming Trees, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Nirvana are all labeled \u2018Grunge\u2019 but all sound different. I consider such acts as Sonic Youth, Neil Young, Tom Petty all as Grunge type bands, but there is also newer bands like Badflower, The Glorious Sons, and The Fever 333 who I also consider Grunge. I prefer the term Alternative Rock, and most people in the Seattle Area will shun away from the word \u2018Grunge\u2019. \u2018Grunge\u2019 is such a broad term that its hard to find listeners of it, but most alternative bands have a \u2018Grunge\u2019 sound. People who listen to Folk rock, Noise rock, 90s alt rock, New Wave Rock, basically can be lumped into the \u2018Grunge\u2019 Genre. When describing my music I prefer the term \u2018Non-Genre Specific\u2019, so as not to be caught up in the drama of labels. ",
