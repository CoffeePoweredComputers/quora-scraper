            "answer_text": "G major. There are a couple of ways to tell: 1. Play along. The tonic chord, G major, starts each verse and each chorus. It also ends the chorus, which means it's the last chord in the song. It's the home chord, the place of repose, the key to the song's chord progression. 2. Look at a guitarist's left hand. Right at the start they play a little tunaround chord progression, G - F - C - G, which establishes the song's key. It's a rock/pop faithful, I - bVII - IV - I, the \"Hey Jude\" progression, found in thousands of songs. In fact, if you assume the guitars are in standard tuning (and the odds are on your side), and you know the song To Love Somebody, you can make a pretty good guess as to the key of this version without even having the sound turned up.
