            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a quick screenshot tour of how some of the settings work in Auto-Tune. I should mention that the screenshots are shown using Waves Tune, which is competitive brand of Auto-Tune. In all the screenshots, you can click on the shot for an expanded view. In the first screenshot below, notice the squiggly lines across the center of the interface window. These squiggly lines represent pitch. The orange line represents the uncorrected pitch as recorded by the singer. The green line shows the corrected pitch. The white boxes with the red outline represent \u201cPitch Segments.\u201d Each segment represents a note length from left to right and note pitch from top to bottom. Both are interpretations of the software that vary depending on the settings. A good group of settings help determine how accurately the software follows the intended results of the artist. In the first screenshot, we see how the software interprets note length and pitch when the controls are set for the most natural sounding pitch correction. You can see that the corrected pitch (green) is very nearly the same as the original pitch (orange).  In this second screenshot (below), the Pitch Segmentation has been set to the minimum number of segments. More segmentation means that the software will be following the original pitch in much more detail. This allows for very intricate editing of a complex performance, but it would be far too detailed for editing pitches with long, sustained notes.  This third screenshot shows Pitch Segmentation set to the maximum number and is not a good setting for this performance. You can see in several spots, that the note length was interpreted as being longer than it should be and some intentional notes in the melody were missed and corrected to the wrong note.  In this fourth screenshot, we\u2019re looking at Pitch Segmentation at the minimum number, with the all pitch correction controls set to the maximum. You can see that all the subtle nuances of vocal expression and glide time between notes have been overridden by the software and the pitch instantly skips from one note to the next. This is what\u2019s taking place when Auto-Tune is being used for a contemporary vocal sound effect.  In the last screenshot (below), we see all controls set for maximum pitch correction, but the Pitch Segmentation has been set too radically at 100. Similar to the third screenshot, there are several notes that have been segmented for too long a time and some of the intended notes in the melody are incorrectly changed.  On the whole, Auto-Tune settings are used by the sound engineer to best match the source material to the intended outcome. All pitch corrections are highly editable, but editing pitch on a note-by-note basis is a real time eater. So, the Auto-Tune settings are a way of getting the software to do as much of the work as possible before pitch editing begins. ",
