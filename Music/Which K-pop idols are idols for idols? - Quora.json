            "answer_text": "Here are a few idols that are goals for their hoobae's 1.Kai (exo) - Kai(Kim jong-in),best known for his duality, as soft puppy jongin to sexy confident Kai is the person many young hoobae's look upto. Kai is no doubt an amazing performer on stage and the best dancer in exo (and one of the best in kpop). His expressions while dancing and his clean dance moves attract ooh's and aahhh's from everyone and everywhere . You can't help but fall in love with this sweetheart (yes ,your gender doesn't matter). He easily becomes the centre of attention anywhere he performs . I really understand people who call him a GOD ,as a matter of fact ,he is !! Jisung and jaemin from NCT, Taeyang from sf9 (not BigBang) ,Kang Daniel from wanna one are few of the hoobae's that are completely smitten by the 'sexy god' -kai.  2. Jimin (BTS )- I mean ,we all saw it coming ,didn't we ? Jimin is a cute cuddly soft and adorable mochi off sets but when he becomes F****** Park jimin ,god oh god ,ask for the heavens to let us breathe !. Isn't jimin the definition of a full grown STADIUM KILLER ? The eff he is ! Considering BTS's popularity ,it's quite obvious why everyone looks upto them ,but park jimin has his own special fanclub of idols . Like ARMY frequently say how jimin has the ability to turn STARIGHT guys GAY ,I honestly couldn't agree more, from what I have seen ,there exists a 100% truth in the statement . Jimin is a fantastic dancer , an amazing singer and beautifully unique . Need I say more ? Okay a)He is PARK JIMIN . b)Enough said .  3.G-dragon- Titled as the 'most fashionable idol' ,g dragon is probably the most successful soloists in korea(ik he is in BigBang). G-dragon has been a role model for new rookies for almost a decade now ,amazing huh? . Seeing his energy and charisma same as that of his debut days ,has this idol even aged a bit? Nah fam, I don't think so . The BigBang leader is the most famous and successful rapper in korea which make his hoobae's especially the rapping line rookies look upto him and follow him .  4.Sandara Park - Dara is personally my favourite female idol . Looks , vocals ,charisma ,class -you name it ,she's got it!. With talent as much as her's ,it's is no surprise that many male idols have her set as their ideal type, even g dragon. F*** she is my ideal type (and I am a girl). I find her class and charisma unrivalled even to this date . She has the right amount of aeygo and maturity which doesn't make her look stupid like other female idols (no offence to anyone).  There are of course other idols like BTS V, SHINEE TAEMIN ,BIGBANG TAEYANG,SNSD YOONA ,I will try to edit my answer and write about them ! If you like the answer ,please do upvote <3 ",

Since the 4th gen has just started and is more to grow we\u2019ll definitely see more names soon. ",
