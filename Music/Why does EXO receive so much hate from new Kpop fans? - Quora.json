            "answer_text": "Few reasons: Misconception: EXO have this kind of cold, serious aura and of course all of them have good visuals and visuals are considered cold or whatever, seem stupid but I have seen people say that alot.Love shot: the song is supposed to be sexy and such and since this song is their most popular as of now, people tend to judge them solely on this song even though I don't know what is intimating about the song but whatever.EXO-Ls: seems we are toxic and deserve to be burnt in hell especially for alot of ARMYs so people hate on EXO because they hate EXO-Ls.Dating: people hate on Kai because of this stupid reason as you see EXO dated alot for a normal K-pop group, some groups never got caught dating but EXO have three dating scandal and appearantly one of the members get married and a child before marriage, so new fans tend to think that they are playful especially Kai since he dated publicly twice, yes because 26 year old man dating publicly twice in his life makes him a fuck boy, whatever.Some of the members have RBF, Sehun and D.O. got hate because they rarely react in awards shows (thank god they don't attend these shows anymore), and their RBF doesn't help with the situation.Their performances: when performing some of their songs, they show up as arrogant, cold and playful people, but like what people except them to act when they perform songs like artificial love, diamond, run this, kokopop, love shot, etc, they won't act dovey dovey, right?They don't participate in their music: yes, let's forget about all the songs that Chen & Chanyeol wrote, and pretend that SC don't exist, and Suho didn't write all of his songs except for curtain and his OSTs, and forget about Lay, he definitely not one of the most well rounded people in the industry.They are arrogant and jerks, alot of people say that but when they are asked to show something to support their claim, silence era begins.They are racists, colourists: I admit Chanyeol and Beakhyun made some stupid remarks about Kai's skin colour and they should be hold accountable for it but they have never treated him like he is beneath them because of his skin colour, but their remarks have hurt him so they deserve to be hold accountable, and for Chen's accident, if people are offended then I respect that, he made a mistake and he didn't apologize but once again what he said is complete ignorance and there was no sign of racism in his words, being raised in a complete ignorant country myself, I wouldn't have realized that it was offensive if it wasn't for people pointing it out, but if you want to hate them, do whatever you want, I won't even try.They are privileged and didn't work for their success: they are from SM, they had everything, but due to mistreatment 3/4 Chinese members left and the rest were pretty much mistreated too, but people made fun out of it, yet they didn't deserve their success, even though they got hated even before their debut, their mental health amazes me to be honest.Their songs are all about love: yes, because Mama, Eldorado, let out the beast, power, oasis, Jekyll, stronger, diamond, etc are about love too.They are rude to fans: if they called EXO-Ls toxic behaviour out, people will say it's rude and if they didn't call EXO-Ls out, people will hate on EXO because they don't maintain their fans, Do you know how many times K-EXO-Ls posted their photos with an EXO member because they have met them in some random place and asked for a sign or a photo and no one mentioned anything about being disrespected.They are fake, they are just co-workers, they are the most problematic group to exist, they are too manufactured, and Chanyeol is Narcissist, I am sure people don't even know what this word means but whatever.Maybe there are some more, who knows.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see any reason to hate them (or any other group) but I\u2019ll try to come up with some reasons. Some new fans do not want to admit the influace Exo (and other senior bands) had on creating and popularizing kpop. Their bands wouldnt be as popular without senior bands but they want to believe their bands created whole industry. Some of them do believe misconceptions about Exo. That they are boring, are just dolls with no passion or emotions, their friendship is fake, just always give proper answers (as if they didn\u2019t spend last 2 years dissing SM), are arrogant, racist, do not know how to writer music, had it all easy. All the things that you get in some kpop circles repeated with noone actually checking what is true what is not. Some fans might be annoyed at how big they still are. I kind of get that. If I would be a fan of a band that debuted in wrong timing and can\u2019t get recognition because spotlight is on bands that got popular before I\u2019d feel frustrated. No reason to hate tho. Exo being from SM, that comes with many fans and many haters. Industry changed a lot and bands now are quite different than Exo. It seems that companies are less controling also this days I feel that choose people with different personalities than Exo. Letting idols write more music is more important now than before. Music got more rap focused instaed of vocal focused. Style of preferable dance also changed. Making friendship as a base of promoting group is more in standard than before. Some new fans look at Exo through new groups standard and it\u2019s disadventagous to them. So since new fans became fans of new groups and thats their style some don\u2019t get hype about Exo. Some fault here might be on ExoLs too. Some are frustrated at Exo being not promoted for a sake of NCT, some dislike that BTS are now on Exo spot, some just are haters themselves, some see other bands through Exo standard, dislike band and express this opinion. As when the other fandoms get offended the easiest (and worsed) way to \u201cfight\u201d with ExoLs is attacking Exo. It happens with all the fandoms obviously, not only ExoLs and I really hope at some point it will stop\u2026 ",
