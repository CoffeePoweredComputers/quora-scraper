            "answer_text": "You need to differentiate \u201cnew art form\u201d further. Do you mean a totally new way to convey ideas to another human being with the means of creative expression of symbols or do you mean a special kind of doing the things that are already established (literature, music, painting, etc\u2026)? If you mean the first one than probably no, because all forms of art are bound to the sensory appreciation of it. You listen with your ears and therefore we can create receivable music, you look with your eyes and therefore we can create receivable paintings. There always needs to be a certain \u201ccannel\u201d wherein your art can be received. We have a limited amount of senses and so the already existing forms of art are all there is, because they play on all our sensors. If we find a way to telepathically convey our brain waves directly (with modern technology) to another person than a new form of art may emerge, but right now we are bound to the traditional senses and the reciprocal art forms for them. ^^ If you mean the second one than sure. If you look into the history of the arts some more complex way of art always followed a more rudimentary form of it (often hand in hand with the rise of technological innovations) or different kinds of it got enmeshed (Video Games = Visual Arts + Storytelling + Music\u2026). So you may find a way to combine already existing forms of art into a bigger conglomerate or the technological means to make an already existing form more intricate. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I try everyday to create something that is me and sometimes continue to differentiate my styles if I ever decide I want to create a new series, illustration or cartoon that either separates from my other work. But when it comes to art styles\u2026you find them in unlikely places. Either by other artists, nature or ancient artifacts that can inspire you to build from scratch or take from what you\u2019ve learned from other artists and apply your own twist to it or by gathering ideas on applying your art style on how nature evolves and shape the earth; for example, an ant mind have intricate shapes. And if you look up ant molds you can probably gather ideas on what your art style could be. As well as ancient artifacts that provide the best way to build your art style from the past and use what the ancient ones have done and put a twist on that as well. ",
