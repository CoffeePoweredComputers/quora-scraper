            "answer_text": "Let me preface this by saying that becoming professional is quite easy. Make a rate card and slap on professional on your business card, and there you are. Now, how to be successful is another matter altogether. I think the first step apart from the obvious (know your technique, pick a genre, be good at it and so on) is to identify your unique selling proposition (USP). This is what differentiates you from everyone else and this is basically what you do. You are the guy who takes black and white pictures of turtles. Now, this might sound simple enough, but you need to think it trough well and focus everything else you're doing on that. So let's break it down:  Unique - pick something that no-one else is doing. If you look at Terry Richardson's work, you'll probably say \"Man, I could do that yesterday\". And that's true, you could, I could as well. But that's his thing, and it's already taken. In the end, the best you could do is to be as good as him at it, and why should I hire you if he's already doing it? On the other side, from that viewpoint everything is taken, so pick something that's not taken in your market. Nobody is shooting weddings exclusively in black and white? Be the black and white guy.Be consistent with it. If I'm hiring a photographer, I don't need someone who is versatile and makes something unique every time. Nobody needs a suprise-me guy who does something different every time. I need B&W pictures of turtles? I'll call the B&W turtles guy and expect to get some B&W pics of turtles out of it. Don't surprise me with your creativity and get me awesome psychedelic cats, get me my bloody turtles.Write down what your style is taking into consideration everything mentioned above. I'm going to shoot lifestyle images, they are going to be light and use a limited color range of earth tones, there's going to be lens flare, they are going to be shot outdoors and so on. (make sure your style is really yours, don't just write random stuff down like I did, it is your photography in the end). Now stick to it, perfect it, practice it, improve it until they are the best bloody lifestyle lens flared airy images in the world. Than evolve into different stuff, adding and subtracting from your style. But it is really important for you to know that before you start shooting and plan accordingly, don't get a couple of models, shoot random stuff and try to see what sticks, that's the fastest track to mediocrity there is.Selling part - make sure they are sell-able. It's going to be tough to make a living from shooting B&W turtles, so probably better start with something more practical than that.Add other unique elements to your business apart from your shooting style. When I started working for a news site, there were five of us there. Everyone was better than me, more experienced and using better gear. But I was the guy who was never late. Ever. I streamlined and automated my workflow so I could make sure I had the images on the desk in the shortest time. Nobody was tagging and organizing their pics on the server, so I started doing it. There's a bunch of little things you can do to make yourself indispensable to your client. The best shot of Angelina Jolie in the world doesn't help my editor much if it comes in after deadline, my average shot is the best shot in the world if the world consists of only one shot that came in first. Find these things in your market and work at them (for weddings, have the fastest turnover, provide your clients with a pre-wedding checklist, have spare make-up with you and so on). It's the little things.And finally, when you have it all done, market the hell out of it. Propose your unique selling proposition to your clients, make that the centerpiece of your marketing effort so you can have a unified message to get across. If you can convince your client that you are the best option for B&W turtles in the world and that you are the guy that really knows how to do that, the price is just a formality. ",

            "answer_text": "I get the question a lot. What do you need to do to become a successful photographer? And unfortunately there is no easy answer, no shortcut (that is actually pretty good for every professional photographer out there, if it would be easy we'd be pretty f**ed). Here's some of the things every great photographer does before he becomes great. GROW YOUR NETWORK When you need the help of someone, it is to late to get to know her. You'll be amazed how far someone will go to help a friend. A friend, that is. Not a guy you've never talked to who is now sending you tweets asking how to get in touch with National Geographic. Get out there and help people, praise their work, ask them things you are genuinely interested in and share their work with others. In the future, when you need help with something, the'll most certainly be there for you. DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO PHOTOGRAPH No. You should not be a photographer that shoots \"everything\". No, I don't care what you think, I've been doing this for 5 years and I know better than you. You need to be good at something that others aren't. In the beginning, of course, you'll need to shoot some portraits, some children and some weddings just to make the ends meet financially.Become really good in a specific field and show that of. People will remember you. SET UP GOALS When you know what you want to shoot, think about what you need to get there. Make plans for what you should accomplice in one month, three month, a year and three years. What do you need to learn during that time? What clients do you have? What do you do? If you want to get somewhere, you need to know where you are heading. GET OVER THE FEAR OF PHOTOGRAPHING PEOPLE If you have any trouble walking up to someone you've never met before and take her picture, get over it. Fear of talking to you peers will NEVER help you create photos, you need to learn that there is nothing to be afraid of. START STEALING Whenever you find a photographer producing great images, steal her technique. If someone is doing something good, learn how and do the same. I'm not saying you'll be able to use it to earn money at once, but when you've collected enough techniques they will blend into something that is yours. Like breaking in to peoples houses, stealing their gold rings and melting them all down into a golden bracelet. No-one will ever know. TRAVEL THE WORLD The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page, said Augustine of Hippo. Great photographers are on top of things. They know what it is all about. See new places, get to know new people. Learn from everyone and everything. You do not want to be an ignorant photographer. Be aware, be everywhere and be enlighten. FIND YOUR SOURCES OF INSPIRATION Other photographers are awesome for inspiration. But movies, music, art, sports, love and hate could be the things that sparks that part of your brain that will make the good stuff. Be aware of what fuel your brain runs on and never let the tank run empty. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY Everything is linked together. If you eat junk, never exercise and sleeping to few hours it will mess up your creativity. I don't care if you walk, run, fight or climb walls - work your body. Note-Never hesitate to take a photograph! you may be surrounded by a lot of people and they may even stare at you when you are clicking, but try ignoring them! off course its difficult to ignore people, but u ll learn this in course of time! And always remember process of learning never stops, grasps as much as you can, learn from people, praise their good work and always be ready to serve your knowledge who so ever demands it! And at-last the most important thing no matter in what so ever profession you are, BE A MAN OF GOOD HEART ! Good Luck Comment if you need more suggestions, I\u2019ll be glad to help. Cheers :) ",
