            "answer_text": "You see this picture bruh??  Yep, I know.. those rib cages sticking out scares the shit out of me too.. Yep too skiny and I believe this girl only weighs 43\u201346 kls.. very much underweight for her height of 5\u20326 whom, supposedly, should weigh around 56\u201366 kls. I dont and will never consider this healthy. She looks like she hasnt eaten for ages. Yep the intense dieting to attain the \u201cideal\u201d weight of Korean standards which until this very moment im still struggling to understand. This girl says she eats a lot but has to do extreme workouts so she wont gain weight. This is the sad reality of kpop. NO, not just kpop but the entire South Korea. I\u2019ve seen somewhere in quora that girls who weigh 50kls and above is already considered fat. Like wth?! Thats why you rarely see koreans with curves, and I meant healthy curves. In my hometown in Cebu Philippines, where there are tons of Koreans, you rarely see korean girls with slight curves like literally all of them are skinny. Right now, all we can do is blame their standards as these girls has no control of it and will have to continue being skinny AF for the sake of these stupid arse standards. Note: I blame the standards, not the people, Im pretty sure a lot of Koreans think that these so-called standards are absurd. They are left with no choice but to follow it or else they\u2019ll get bullied. Yes it really sucks. EDIT: If you find this offensive then Im sorry but I dont like sugar-coating things. No one can deny the fact that this girl in the picture above is really too skinny for her height. AGAIN, you cant blame her as she has to live up to korean expectations and standards. Probably as much as she wants to gain more weight, she couldn\u2019t as she already has the mindset that it may ruin her career. PEACE OUT! ",

            "answer_text": "cameras and videos make people look 'fatter', which means those idols would look even more skinny irl. That's just ugh. \"Gym, studio, bedroom \u2014 that's my life circle,\" said Ho Ryeong, one of the band members. \"We are now preparing for our new album and are actually quite busy.\" \"Honestly, we don't have much time for eating,\" he said. \"Nor are we free to eat what we want.\" Another member, Jae I, chimed in: \"That's the hardest part. It's not easy to follow a diet, but [I suppose] it's not impossible either.\" It's a testament to the pressures of maintaining the intense beauty standards of the K-pop industry: idols must look and stay beautiful, young, and in good physical shape. That usually ends up in severe diets and exercise regimes. One famous K-pop diet, known as the \"Paper Cup Diet,\" involves eating nine paper cups \u2014 the size of the ones you'd find by water coolers \u2014 worth of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables every day. Discussion of this diet is also popular among on pro-anorexia forums. a former member of K-pop band Crayon Pop, told \"We weren't allowed to eat midnight snacks. Other snacks like chips and candy weren't allowed, so we would sneak out and eat it.\" Gym routines are also grueling. \"We used to dance with 4 kg (8.8 lbs) of sandbags on our feet for several days,\" Way said. \"Our teacher wanted us to get used to the sandbags, so without it our dances would look lighter [in the performance].\" It's worth noting that these beauty standards affect other industries in South Korea too: The country's flight attendants often turn to cosmetic surgery to be beautiful and thin, to increase their odds of securing jobs.
