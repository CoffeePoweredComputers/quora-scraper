            "answer_text": "Yes, if you have the proper plugins. FL Studio 20 is still amazing software to use even if you don\u2019t have any plugins like Serum or Massive, but having those plugins makes everything better. FL Studio is an amazing software to use when it comes to producing music. It is easy to use, and the effects are amazing. Make sure you get a version where you can use and record audio clips. If you really are thinking of buying it, try out the trial version first to make sure you really want to get it. But yeah, FL is definitely worth buying in my opinion. I\u2019ve tried Ableton and I hated it for many reasons. Also look into the plugins I mentioned earlier if you don\u2019t already have them, they are called Serum, and Massive. They are expensive, but one of the best plugins out there. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely (depending on what version you get). By getting the producer edition, you can get access to a large array of tools to use that will cover all of the essentials you may need to make music. With a lifetime of free updates, you won\u2019t have to worry about paying for the latest features ever. Many of the stock plugins that come with FL Studio are also quite powerful, eliminating the need to invest in effect plugins up front. The synths included are also quite powerful, giving you many presets to work with if you have yet to learn sound design. I hope this helps you, let me know if you have any questions! ",
