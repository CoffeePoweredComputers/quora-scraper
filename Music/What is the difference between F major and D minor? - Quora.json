            "answer_text": "F Major and D minor are relative keys to each other. They both have one flat in the key signatures: Bb. F Major and D (natural) minor share the same notes, but start on different notes. F Major: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F D natural minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C, D (none of the notes are changed) D harmonic minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C#, D (raise the 7th from C to C#)D melodic minor: D, E, F, G, A, B, C#, D (raise both the 6th and 7th: Bb becomes B, and C becomes C#)As you can tell in D minor, the scale degrees 6 and 7 vary because there are 3 different versions of a minor scale. In D minor, there will usually be lots of C#\u2019s (raised 7ths) and sometimes B naturals (raised 6ths) being used (to create harmony and melody), while these are not that common in F Major. The chords are also used differently. F Major primary chord progressions: I = F-A-C = FM (F Major triad)IV = Bb-D-F = BbM (Bb Major triad)V = C-E-G = CM (C Major triad)V7 = C-E-G-Bb = C7 (C dominant 7th)D minor primary chord progressions i = D-F-A = Dm (D minor triad)iv = G-Bb-D = Gm (G minor triad)V = A-C#-E = AM (A Major triad)V7 = A-C#-E-G = A7 (A dominant 7th chord)*Note, in the key of D minor, the V chord is an A-MAJOR chord, because when we build a dominant chord in the minor key, we raise the 7th scale degree to make it the leading tone and for the chord to have a dominant function. In the key of D minor, we raise the C to C# to create the dominant chord (A-Major). So F Major normally \u201cgravitates\u201d to F, and D minor normally \u201cgravitates\u201d to D. ",

            "answer_text": "As you probably know, they both use the same chords and notes - D minor is the relative minor of F major. It more or less comes down to what chord a piece of music starts on. So, if you see a key signature for the key of F (one flat - Bb) and the piece starts on the chord F, the piece will generally sound like it\u2019s in the major key of F and the other chords in the key will tend to want to \u2018pull back towards it\u2019. However, if you see the same key signature and the piece starts on Dm, it takes on the minor tonality of Dm and all the chords in the key (even though they\u2019re the same chords as the key of F) will tend back towards the Dm. Generally, a piece in the major key will start on the major I chord (in this case, F), and the piece will sound most complete if it ends on the F chord. A piece in Dm, will start on the Dm and sound most complete ending on the Dm chord, although, sometimes a piece that is in the minor key will end on the major chord as a nice little uplifting surprise :) ",
