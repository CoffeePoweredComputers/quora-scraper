            "answer_text": "The easiest way is to disassemble the unit and access the back of the jack, and you can push it out with a piece of stiff wire, like a paperclip. If that\u2019s not an option you could try to put a drop of gel superglue on the end of that same piece of paperclip wire and put it in the socket, and hope you can glue the end of the wire to the broken piece of the plug. This probably won\u2019t work because either your hand will shake and you\u2019ll end up getting glue all over the socket and making the problem worse.The other issue is that there is often a plastic insulator gasket between the tip/ring/sleeve of the broken jack, and if that plastic is still in the socket, your superglue drop won\u2019t stick to it, so all your efforts would be in vain. So that sends us back to the first option, which is to remove the entire head unit, open it up and push the broken part out from the back of the jack with a stiff piece of paperclip wire. ",

With any luck, the stuck piece will come with it. ",
