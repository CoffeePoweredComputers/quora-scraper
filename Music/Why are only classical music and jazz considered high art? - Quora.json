            "answer_text": "Because of the context and circumstances that have surrounded those genres. Jazz, for example, started out in whorehouses, and it was considered music that entertained and allowed the audience to dance. Over time it grew its popularity, and moved into dance halls, but it was still considered as music to entertain only. The perception of Jazz really changed when Bop was created. Musicians like Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Dizzy Gillespie took the music to a different level. Their music was no longer to be danced only but to be listened. They considered themselves as serious musicians now and behaved as such. As a consequence of that, their popularity fell really bad. Rock went through a similar process. It started out as music to be danced, with a strong sexual connotation, and later evolved as music to be listened with The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Who, etc., but the main difference between both genres is that Rock didn\u2019t lose popularity like Jazz did when that evolution occurred. And for some, popularity and \u201chigh art\u201d are mutually exclusive. There\u2019s no real objective reason to believe that Glenn Miller\u2019s music is high art while King Crimson\u2019s is not. Circumstances that surrounded their music and the context in general had made each others music to be considered of higher value for ones and lesser for others, which is kind of silly if you think about it.

            "answer_text": "At one time certain forms of classical music were considered at the lower end of the spectrum - for example ballet music. Tchaikovsky of course, was instrumental in transforming attitudes, yet even so, it took a long time after his death for attitudes gradually to change. Now his ballet scores are accorded similar stature to that of the symphonic form. What I\u2019m suggesting is that engrained opinions can be very hard to shift, and this undoubtedly is a factor in the lesser status accorded to some other musical genres. Of course, it could be argued that other genres of music are less sophisticated, the music more naive and the musicians less musically literate. I would be bold enough to say that this is often true, but NOT UNIVERSALLY so. The BEST music in other genres is certainly worthy of being put in a high tier category, even if some classical musicians are unwilling (through snobbery) to acknowledge the fact. ",
