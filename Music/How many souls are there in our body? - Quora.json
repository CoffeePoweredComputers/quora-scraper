            "answer_text": "Please read this with an open mind, as fantasy or sci-fi, if you like. But there may be a bit of truth here. To discuss this question, as written, we must accept a spiritual being inhabiting a physical body. I prefer the Vadantic cosmology that, as I understand it, considers our physical-spiritual complexes to be only vehicles in which our individual consciousnesses (atmans) experience the universe, rather like a \u201cprobe\u201d carrying our consciousnesses into the physical universe. If we did not possess the spiritual body/bodies separate from our physical bodies our consciousnesses would \u201cdie\u201d with the death of our physical bodies. Since our consciousness is the consciousness of God (Atman)(God knows everything we know and experience because our consciousness of it IS God\u2019s consciousness of it\u2014admittedly a belief rather then proven fact) death of that consciousness would be the death of part of God\u2019s consciousness. By definition of God, that does not appear to be acceptable. So, our spark of consciousness/God consciousness is carried in spiritual body/bodies. And our spiritual bodies help form, inhabit, and give life to our physical bodies so we can experience these physical lives. Some believe every new physical being gets a new spiritual entity and consciousness. Some even believe that the developing physical body actually creates the spirit and consciousness. I, because of personal experience, fully accept reincarnation as common future for many, if not most, beings when we become disincarnate upon the death of our physical bodies. I also accept the possibility that by following Jesus, or another great being, a being might pass up reincarnation for some \u201cheavenly\u201d life. Also, from personal experience, I know there are spiritual beings that do not appear to reincarnate. They may be Bodhisattva, spiritual beings who started out, as we all did, reincarnating many, many times in this physical universe and advanced to a level of not needing to reincarnate unless it was desirable for some reason. I expect there are many other vehicles of definable points of consciousness\u2014-angels, seraphim, muses, etc. I do not know if we all have similar spiritual make up. Now to the question: some define the soul as the connection or relationship between the physical and spiritual bodies. I don\u2019t really understand that and think of the soul and the spiritual bodies as the same. (Think \u201cclothes\u201d that include underclothes, outerwear, and over coat but more intermixed then layered.) I think the question is how many definable spiritual bodies are known. And I don\u2019t think anyone really knows. People speak of the astral body, mental body, ethereal body, causal body, etc. I think of these \u201cbodies\u201d as definable packets of energy with differing qualities\u2026.vibrational, intensity, interactive, magnetic, love transmission, etc. It is possible that the electro-magnetic energy generated by the movement of electrons and charged particles in the chemical functioning of our physical bodies does enhance the energy of our spiritual bodies. That may make sense since the spiritual bodies are actually more closely aligned with the physical body then with the atman. I do know that in the process of reincarnation the spiritual part of our being \u201coversees\u201d the development of the physical body, like an architect directing from plans after construction has begun, using materials that fit together and interact in natural ways. The architect has creativity but is limited by the limitations of the materials available to him. In this the energies of our spiritual bodies would be affecting energies and shape of the developing physical body. This might be thought of as scientific creationism. I also know that in reincarnation the spiritual body does not take full possession of the developing physical body until about the third trimester. It may be in and out with relative ease until that time. After that and after birth, our spirits can leave our bodies but with much more difficulty. Re evolution of our spiritual bodies: It is thought that at some very high level of refinement our consciousnesses can leave our spiritual bodies and rejoin with universal consciousnesses\u2014become one with the consciousnesses of God. That would imply death or, at least, forsaking our spiritual bodies. Possible, I suppose. But I prefer to remember we are all already a part of the consciousness of God and we are needed here, to experience and be aware of our little parts of this enormously vast universe. I know that this discussion is a bit disjointed a may create more questions than answers. I am planning a blog re this topic of \u201clife after life\u201d and look forward to an open free discussion of experiences and observations. In the meantime let us accept and be all that we are. Let God within shine out with love and blessings! ",

            "answer_text": "this is the big mystery , wonder of life.It\u2019s possible that only exists one Soul that lives in billions of humans beings. It\u2019s possible that each humann being is just a of expression of the same soul. Probably we have the same feeling about \u2018I am\u2019. The accounts of the persons who had near death experiences or appearances of of beings that live already in other realms (the fysical body has died) prove that they keep there individuality .But is also possible that in still higher realms some individuals melt together with 2 or 4 or 10 individualities. I think is important to understand and to realise that soul one is and just the bodies are differents. Therefore is important to strive and use your power peacefully for truth,honesty,justice .Not for your advantage or gain but that the other individuals can learn important life lessons. Despite that you have the experience to be individuals it\u2019s possible that you are one in our souls. ",
