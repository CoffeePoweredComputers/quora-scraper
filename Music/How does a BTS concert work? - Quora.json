            "answer_text": "Right after I bought my tickets I joined a group that was specific to the New Jersey shows ! It was amazing because you get to interact with ALOT of Armys and it\u2019s a good place to ask any questions you may have. Our group was very interactive with each other so we were all willing to help answer questions and keep each other up to date on things relating to the shows, or for people to buy/sell tickets, and overall it helped provide good concert information. It was good to know MANY other people where having the same concerns and thoughts that I was having getting ready for that concert, so it\u2019s a great resource to help you! A lot of us planned a meet up on the concert day and it was awesome to meet fellow Army\u2019s ! I know most stops had their own group chat from others that I\u2019ve spoken to from different shows ! It\u2019s important especially the last couple weeks leading up to the concert that you constantly check BigHits social media for concert and merch info and the stadium page specifically for the venue you are going to, for all the rules and regulations on what you can bring in, and bag policy and all that, to help you prepare. If your committed to getting all the merch, and doing the photo booths and everything, you basically want to plan to spend your entire day at the stadium ! Here\u2019s a lay down of how it was In New Jersey: \u2022If you plan to do the VR photo booth where basically you get to pick your bias and get to take a couple photos with him in VR form than you need to plan to be up at crack of dawn. It\u2019s pretty cool and worth it if you REALLY want a picture with your bias lol. But let me warn you, this is not easy to get into. A few weeks before the concert, BigHit releases a survey that you have to fill out and if.. I mean big IF your lucky enough to be chosen you will receive a QR code that you use to get into the photo booth and you get to skip the line.(So that\u2019s why following BigHit social media is important especially on Twitter). But even saying that you don\u2019t always get to skip the line. In New Jersey people were lining up at like 2:30am the night before the show to make sure they got in(camping is not allowed) ! Now some stops allowed a certain number of people without codes a chance to wait in line and if you were lucky you had to play a ball game where you put your hand in this box and have to pull out a ball with the right color AND THEN you were allowed to go in, if you didn\u2019t get the right ball you weren\u2019t allowed to. So basically what I\u2019m saying is doing this is a BIG gamble to spend hours in line with a small chance of success but it is possible ! As for Merch, BigHit released the form online so you can see what the merch looks like before hand so it gives you an idea of what\u2019s there. At MetLife they had a big portion of the parking lot blocked off for merch express booths, army bomb booths, a mediheal booth, and the photo booths! If you plan to purchase Merch, there\u2019s a spot near the entrance of the GO express booths and you have to fill out the paper with the quantity, and full amount of how much it is so it\u2019s ready when you get up to the table they can just use your sheet to grab all your items ! It happens quickly so make sure your prepared and have it filled out ! A little tip I learned, is what they don\u2019t have at the merch GO, they will have inside possibly. If it\u2019s an item that sells out quickly ( like the garland and some of the photos and the shopping bags) , I had to get some of them inside the venue ! So don\u2019t get discouraged until you\u2019ve exhausted all the merch booths ! If you don\u2019t have an Army bomb and plan to go to a BTS concert, I highly suggest you get one there. They are a lot cheaper to buy at the actual venue than ordering online and this way you know they are 100 % real. When you purchase one or bring one in, they have staff on site that can help you program your Army Bomb to your seat so that way you\u2019ll be in sync with your section and your seat ! And they NEVER sell out of Army bombs so that\u2019s something you don\u2019t have to worry about ! Give yourself plenty of time to wait in line and get ready to go in! We started hanging out around our area around 3:30 and then a line started forming for the security around 4 and we were 10th in line and it was smooth sailing after that! We were able to get in super fast, collect our fan banner and QR code card( gives you points on BigHits website), from the entrance without all the chaos yet and it gave us time to hit the merch booths before the insanity, get some food and find our spots ! 15 minutes after we got inside, I saw the lines outside and they were INSANE, so if you plan your day smart, you shouldn\u2019t have to many issues ! Don\u2019t worry there is staff around everywhere to help if you have any concerns or issues once inside ! The pre show on the stage screens were playing all of BTS\u2019s music videos so it gave everyone a chance to get excited and all pumped up! Everyone started singing along and getting really into it which is awesome ! They also play a video of BTS explaining how to set up the app for the Army bomb on the stage screens as well so that\u2019s a way to help you make sure your completely ready to go! It plays on repeat every so often so don\u2019t worry if you miss it. Now as for Fan Chants\u2026 if your not a sing along kind of person you do not have to join in on those, there\u2019s no pressure at all to do them if you choose not to, you will not be judged for it ( well by most anyways), or even if you just don\u2019t know them but want to, there\u2019s plenty of ways on social media, especially YouTube where you can watch tutorials and practice the fan chants yourselves so you can be apart of the Army magic ! I do highly recommend at least knowing their name fan-chant off by heart because it\u2019s the one that almost everyone does and it gets you hyped up and shows your support to the boys ! The other chants are not challenging to Learn as well, or just pick your favourites and learn them if it\u2019s too much ! Sometimes Army\u2019s like to being in new chants or BTS meme chants ( like the infamous Golden Maknae fanchant that started in Metlife ) ! Things like that are just amazing to be apart of. But like I said there\u2019s no pressure whatsoever ! And then get ready for the most incredible show of your life and that\u2019s not an exaggeration! BTS knows how to put on an amazing show ! The time flies so make sure you enjoy yourself and don\u2019t just be stuck on your phone ! I remember Suga talking in his VLive how some of his most favourite moments are when people are getting into the music and enjoying themselves and that gets him hyped up to ! He can feel their energy and he hates it when people spend all their time on their phones ! Best advice: Take it all in and be in the moment ! Trust me it flies by! Hope this helped you have an idea of how a BTS concert works ! \u263a\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "As far as I have seen from the videos, their concert is not just a concert. They always prepare something for the army. Some content that army will watch while they get ready and rehearse. That\u2019s so thoughtful and innovative for me. I still remember when the first time I saw their video of \u201cHouse of Army\u201d which was aired during 3rd Muster I was so amazed and enjoyed it a lot. It made me laugh so much. Plus they always change something in every concert. Their outfits, looks, and hairstyles to make it more appealing. Also, their energy on stage is completely different. They are more energetic and passionate. They have a unique strategy to organize concerts. If it\u2019s a concert of 3 hours they will organize it in such a way that army\u2019s who are there won\u2019t get bored and enjoy it to the fullest. They arrange performances of individual artists along with group performances throughout so that meanwhile other members will have time to rehearse and get ready(which is so amazing). The members themselves are so radiating. They enjoy themselves on stage very much which is the fact the army also enjoy it. They do many segments to entertain the army. Members make fun of each other do cute ayego\u2019s, acting and many things. Rm who is known for giving wonderful speeches at concert grabs their attention as well. I personally adore him as a human being. The way he speaks is unique, not each and everyone is capable of doing that especially when you are in front of millions of them. His words really reach army\u2019s hearts, not just ears which is a very big achievement I must say. This is what I have observed and concluded by watching hundreds of videos of BTS on youtube on the various channel including BangtanTv, ibighit and other fanmade channels. My point of view or perspective can be wrong as I haven\u2019t attended their concert. So my apologies on that. ",
