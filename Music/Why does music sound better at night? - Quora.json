            "answer_text": "Because you listen with your ears and your brain. At night your brain tends to be more relaxed and this helps you focus on the listening experience. Music will sound different in the morning, half way through the day and at night. And it has to do with your brain and/or your state of mind. If you have a very High End sound system you may also notice a slight improvement in the sound because at night the electrical grid tends to be a bit \u201ccleaner\u201d than during the day. The main cause for this is the fact that many offices, manufacturing facilities, and/or many heavy machinery tends to be off at night. Another thing you should try is to turn off the lights, relax and close your eyes while listening to the music. Doing so, your eyes will not get the attention of something else in the room and somehow interfere with the experience. The correct way to create an audio room is to, as much as possible, get the hardware (amplifiers, players, turntable, anything that can distract you) out of the way of your viewing angle to one of the sides of the room.  People tend to put all the system between the speakers because it is cheaper to do so and it shortens the length of the cables you have to use. But you should put everything you can to one of the sides of the room.  The lights in the room should be possible to regulate in intensity and while listening they should be as dim as possible. But, bottom line, it has to do with your brain. Your brain is working much harder if you are listening to music but at the same time you have a lot of distractions around you. Some audio companies even decided to go with Psychoacoustics in order to create their sound systems. They use this scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including speech and music). Psychoacoustics received its name from a field within psychology which deals with all kinds of human perceptions. They study sound perception and create audio systems that do not respond to the whole 20Hz to 20Khz because they found out your brain will fill in the blanks. This way they can build a sub-woofer and two small satellite speakers and \u201cfool\u201d you into thinking you are listening to a great sound system and that there is nothing missing. Mp3 files were also based on this sort of \u201ctrick\u201d. Several properties of human hearing are used by lossy audio codecs. Using the properties of the human auditory system, lossy codecs and encoders remove signals to reduce the information content, thus compressing the signal. Different encoders use different psychoacoustic models, models describing how humans perceive sounds and thus what information may be removed.

Read more at MP3 vs AAC vs FLAC vs CD As you can see, there is quite a bit of information missing in a lossy file such as Mp3. But most people will not find the difference when listening to either file. In the end, your brain will \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d. The same could be said in regards to bookshelf loudspeakers. Even very good ones fail to respond below a certain freq response. And if you put most people in front of a Bosendorfer Imperial Grand that can respond as low as 7 Hz  And then you put the same person in front of a good pair of bookshelf speakers, that may only respond from about 35 Hz  Most people will not notice any difference. This is the brain working as it should. Just look at this text. You will be able to read it. Most will. And you can only do that because of your brain.  Your brain is amazing. And can help you do very interesting things. You can even use Brain Entertainment. Brain entertainment is usually brought about by means of sounds that entrain brainwaves into certain natural and beneficial frequencies.  Brain wave entertainment is used by people who want to make rapid change in their behavior or state. It is sometimes used by educators who play tones in the background during a class to help increase learning and concentration. Music moves brain to pay attention, Stanford study finds  So, next time you are listening to music, you will understand how much your brain is working. And this is how it works:  Effects of Music on the Brain The inferior frontal cortex compares new sounds we hear with all of the older templates of sounds we have stored in our superior temporal gyrus. What we think of as our \"taste\" in music depends on all of these old patterns we have filed away. When we listen to music we are constantly making predictions about the sounds we will hear next in a song or the direction the music will take us. This is exactly what we do when we dance. The scientists Zatorre and Valorie Salimpoor also recently used brain scans to show people's brains react when they hear a new song they love. The study, published in the journal Science in April, found that music engages reward-related circuits in our brain.

            "answer_text": "I'd agree with Brooke's answer above, and add that there is conditioning involved. In the morning you're conditioned to make that mad dash to work, and it's hard to enjoy music when you're running late and battling traffic. During the day your conditioned to work. So even if music is on\u2026 Well, you're working. But at night the day's struggles are behind you. There's nothing you can do about whatever it is now, \u201cI'll make a call tomorrow\u201d. So along with being more relaxed. You're also conditioned that it's ok to take time for yourself. ",
