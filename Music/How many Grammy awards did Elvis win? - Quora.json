            "answer_text": "Elvis Presley only won 3 Grammy Awards, all for his \u201cGospel\u201d work, as some of his earliest songs (\u201c\"Hound Dog\u201d , \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d) were released before the creation of the Grammy awards. However, those songs and other Elvis Presley hits that were popular were later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame after his death, as the Hall of Fame only accepts sound recordings that are at least 25 years old (meaning that, as of 2017, the latest song that could be considered for inclusion would've had to been released in 1992). I found the following website which better explains Elvis Presley & his \u201crelationship\u201d with the Grammys: Elvis Presley and the Grammy Awards ",

Best Inspirational Performance in 1974 for another recording of \"How Great Thou Art.\"  According to the Grammys Elvis was just a gospel performer.  It should be pointed out however that the Grammy's only began in 1958 and Elvis had already had two great years before then. And the Grammys were slow to acknowledge Rock and Roll as a force worth rewarding.  ",
