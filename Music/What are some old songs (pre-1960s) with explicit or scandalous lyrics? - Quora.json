            "answer_text": "Warning: explicit content Despite the squeaky-clean image that pre-1960s popular culture seems to have left in our societal consciousness (in America, at least), there are numerous examples of truly scandalous song lyrics from those times. I will split this answer into two sections for two different flavors of lyrical scandal: the sexually explicit, and the overt drug references.  Sexually Explicit Lyrics What is likely my favorite example of sexually explicit lyrics has a great story that comes with it. It requires me to first introduce The Clovers.  The Clovers were a popular vocal harmony group. Their 1959 hit single Love Potion No. 9 may be familiar to some readers. As was the standard practice at the time, they did not primarily write most of the songs that they sang, but rather performed arrangements of the popular music being composed at the time. While it is hard to know the exact details of the recording of what I consider their greatest work, the story I\u2019ve heard goes as follows: Sometime in the early-to-mid 50s, the group went into the studio for a recording session that had been paid for beforehand. Such sessions were booked with the expectation of multiple takes for all parts, but the Clovers were especially on point that day and finished early. Finding themselves with around 45 minutes of remaining studio time already paid for, they asked the engineers if they could record an original song they had written themselves. The result was, in my opinion, absolutely glorious. It was not released until 1995, but here, in all its glory, is that song: Rotten Cocksuckers Ball  Beyond that, Blues music is replete with sexually explicit songs. A few examples are more explicit than almost anything you\u2019d hear today. A notable example by one of the most important Blues singers is Lucille Bogan\u2019s classic Shave \u2019Em Dry, which begins with the timeless words: I got nipples on my titties big as the end of my thumbI got something \u2019tween my legs\u2019ll make a dead man comeOh daddy, baby won\u2019t you shave \u2019em dry.Want you to grind me baby, grind me \u2019til I cry  There are also many great uses of imagery and innuendo in blues music. Most people think of it as a Led Zeppelin lyric, but it was at the end of Traveling Riverside Blues that Robert Johnson originally said: Now you can squeeze my lemon \u2019til the juice run down my...(\u2019til the juice run down my leg, baby, you know what I\u2019m talking about)You can squeeze my lemon \u2019til the juice run down my leg(That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking \u2019bout, now)  There are so many examples that I can\u2019t discuss each one in the depth I would prefer, but here are some other blues examples: What\u2019s That Smells Like Fish? by Blind Boy Fuller (1938)  Please Warm my Wiener by Bo Carter (1935)  There are also those that do their best to at least maintain plausible deniability as to their explicit nature. While they may play at being perfectly wholesome, they also leave no listener in doubt as to what they are really talking about. Such is the case with Vanita Smyth\u2019s smokin\u2019-hot 1946 performance of Back Door Man.  There are numerous Jazz examples as well. Just to prove that black people weren\u2019t the only ones making sex music, I\u2019ll include an example from a white Brit. In 1931, Harry Roy and his Orchestra recorded My Girl\u2019s Pussy, ostensibly about how he loves playing with his girl\u2019s pet cat. But come on, we all know what he\u2019s really talking about\u2026  I realize that I could do this all day, and I have to leave some for others to share, so I will move on to drugs and alcohol.  Drugs and Alcohol It was relatively uncommon for even those artists who regularly used drugs to sing about it until the late 60s, and even in the late 70s, many bands avoided it. Nonetheless, there have been people singing about getting high for a long time. The connection between Jazz and Blues music and drugs was always pretty open and well known, and there are clear examples from both fields. Some of the earliest such recorded songs, however, come from the prohibition era. At that time, even alcohol was an illicit drug, but that didn\u2019t stop Bessie Smith from singing, in her 1920s masterpiece Gimme a Pigfoot: Give me a reefer and a gang of ginPlay me \u2019cause I\u2019m in my sin, oh yeahPlay me \u2019cause I\u2019m full of gin. It\u2019s one of my favorite songs of all time, so I strongly recommend listening to it several times regardless.  Those lines also quote from her earlier hit Me and My Gin, which begins: Stay \u2019way from me cause I'm in my sinStay \u2019way from me cause I'm in my sinIf this place gets raided, it's me and my gin.  Other blues and jazz songs involving drug use include: Junker\u2019s Blues by Champion Jack Dupree (1940)\u2014also the basis of the song \u201cJunco Partner,\u201d covered by many including The Clash and Dr. John.  That Cat is High by The Ink Spots (1938)  Dope Head Blues by Victoria Spivey and Lonnie Johnson (1927)  And, again just to show that white people were occaisionally hip as well, even America\u2019s own great white troubadour Woody Guthrie sang the original version of Cocaine Blues, which would be made famous by Johnny Cash.  And many many more. In conclusion, whenever I hear people talk about sex and drugs in music like it\u2019s a new thing, I usually just shake my head and chuckle. Social conventions may have changed, but people have been singing dirty since long before we were able to record them doing so. ",

            "answer_text": "A half dozen others; Future Jazz Great, Dinah Washington's had some early double entendre 1950s recordings including her visit to the (ahem) \u201cDentist\u201d in Long John Blues and her appreciation of \u201ctrombone players\u201d in Big Long Slidin\u2019 Thing. I doubt Tom Robinson\u2019s list can be bettered but l\u2019ve also included Joe Turner's uncensored version of Shake Rattle & Roll, the much covered and dubious Willie & the Hand Jive and Sixty Minute Man from 1951 where the censor was definitely sleeping. Finally more recently great soul singer and songwriter Denise Lasalle reminds you to Lick it Before you Stick It and she's not talking about postage stamps. Warning: Hilarious Adult Double-Entendre Content Long John Blues by Dinah Washington (Songwriter Tommy George)  I've got a dentist who's over seven feet tallYes I've got a dentist who's over seven feet tallLong John they call him, and he answers every call Well I went to Long Johns office and told him the pain was killin'Yes I went to Long Johns office and told him the pain was killin'He told me not to worry, that my cavity just needed fillin' He said \"when I start drillin', I'll have to give you novocaine\"He said, \"Yes, when I start drillin', I'll have to give you novocaineCause ev'ry woman just can't stand the pain\" He took out his trusted drillAnd he told me to open wideHe said he wouldn't hurt meBut he'd fill my hole insideLong John, Long John, you've got that golden touchYou thrill me when you drill me, and I need you very much When he got through, he said \"Baby that will cost you ten\"Yes when he got through, he said \"Baby that will cost you tenSix months from now, come back and see me again\" Say you're supposed to see your dentist'Bout twice a year, that's rightBut I think I feel it bobbin'Yes I'll go back there tonightLong John, Long John, don't ever move awaySay I hope I keep on achin' so I can see you every day. Big Long Sliding Thing (1954) by Dinah Washington (Mamie Thomas / Eddie Kirkland)  I've been in every barBeen in every honky-tonkBeen tryin' to find my daddyWith that broke down piece o' junkAsk everyone to help meCried, \"Help me if you canyou'll lnow my daddyHe's that trombone playin' manWhere is my daddy?Tell me where is my daddyWith that big long slidin' thing? I even ask a manThat played a steel guitarHe said that you don't need himTo be moved eight to the barHe brought his amplifierAnd he hitched it in my plugHe planked it, and he plunked itBut it just wasn't good enough'Cause I need my daddyNeed my daddy with that big long slidin' thing Well, then a knock came at my door, I said, mmh, my daddy's backI opened up the doorAnd there stood Piano JackHe said, \"I came to do some tinklin'On your piano keysI said, \"Don't make me nervousThis ain't no time to teaseJust send me my daddySend me my daddy with that big long slidin' thing Well, the first time he playedI ask him how it was doneHe said, \"I blow through hereThen I work my fingers and my thumbI slide it right upThen I slide it back againAnd I gdet a lot o' windAnd then I slide it back againThat is my daddyWith that big long sliding thing, oh yeah Another couple of tunes not as explicit but with hidden meanings are the early Rock & Roll Hit Willie and the Hand Jive by The Johnny Otis Show and covered by Eric Clapton & George Thorogood. Set to a Bo Diddley beat the song is obviously about Onanism, but this is only obvious after you've been told (the definition of onanism) . Nice to know that Christian Rocker Cliff Richard also covered the song.  Joe Turner\u2019s original version of Shake Rattle & Roll has verses cut from the Bill Haley and Elvis Presley versions with lines like \u201call that mess belongs to you\u201d and \u201cone eyed cat peepin in the seafood store\u201d (1950s code words for male & female parts, kids) Way you wear those dresses, the sun come shining throughWay you wear those dresses, the sun come shining throughI can't believe my eyes all that mess belongs to you I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a seafood storeI'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a seafood storeWell, I can look at you till you ain't no child no more  Joe Turner - Shake, Rattle & Roll (1954) - a double entendre classic And what exactly is Louis Jordan singing about in Saturday Night Fish Fry?  Louis Jordan - Saturday Night Fish Fry (1949) Finally far less subtle is Billy Ward & his Domino's Sixty Minute Man from 1951  Sixty-minute man, sixty-minute man Look a here girls I'm telling you now They call me \"Lovin' Dan\" I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long I'm a sixty-minute man If you don't believe I'm all that I say Come up and take my hand When I let you go you'll cry \"Oh yes\" \"He's a sixty-minute man\". There'll be 15 minutes of kissing Then you'll holler \"Please don't stop\" (Don't stop !) There'll be 15 minutes of teasing And 15 minutes of squeezing And 15 minutes of blowing my top........
