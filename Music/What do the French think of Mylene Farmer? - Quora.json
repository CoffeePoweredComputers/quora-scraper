            "answer_text": "I\u2019m 38 so I was a pre-teen, going on teenhood when she had her biggest hits. I really liked some of her songs, like \u201cD\u00e9sanchant\u00e9e\u201d or \u201cPourvu qu\u2019elles soient douces\u201d and the corresponding videos which were very cinematic and \u201crisqu\u00e9\u201d. I think a lot of French recognize her as one of the biggest artists in France even if they\u2019re not particularly fond of her music but she\u2019s made a lot of people uncomfortable over the years because of her videos and the strange character she invented. No one really knows how old she is, if she\u2019s had relationships over the years, where she lives etc. Well maybe the fans do because she has a fanbase that is particularly devoted and even crazy about her. You can usually see them cry during her shows, like big tears, they know everything about her and think they know her. She attracts a lot of cuckoos. ",

            "answer_text": "Mylene is one of the biggest stars in France, what is amazing is that she was able to preserve her popularity. Her new album Disobedience shows how Mylene was able to reinvent herself and provide something new to her audience. I think Mylene is not only the biggest French star next to Dalida, but she is also a European star. To me Mylene is like Madonna (better Madonna in my opinion), her work is interesting and at times peculiar. Mylene started her career in 1984 but in 1986 her hit \u201cLibertine\u201d launched her to the stars, her other hits Tristana, Sans Logique, etc also charted and did well. Her popularity spread in the late 1980s to Yugoslavia, Germany, Belgium, Canada, and most recently to Russia. ",
