            "answer_text": "I would think a better question might be what is a Nocturne. comparing it to a sonata concerto, Impromptu or free form the purpose matters. It seems to be played on a piano but some are written for ensemble. I don\u2019t think a Nocturne for classical guitar is excluded - Can you arrange a piano nocturne on guitar or another instrument? This would require you to change the range of the work which would be good for study. I don\u2019t mean this in the study of performance but rather in a creative way to study the literature or to learn to write one your self. To study these composers and the level they think on can be educational. ",
