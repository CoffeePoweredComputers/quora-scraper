            "answer_text": "I have no idea really but my theory is this: (it goes according to how the song flows, DANG THAT RHYMED) Jimin and Tae: They talk about how their lives has been so unpredictable. They talk about their lives changing over the years, about being an idol. They have travelled to so many different places and they are uncertain of what\u2019s next. RM: The shadow he talks about is his past, it stays with him throughout his life. Nevertheless, he is brave and moves forward. Jimin, Jungkook and Jin: Although they each have their own past, they are determined to fight for their success. All: (chorus) Even though they face struggles in life everyday, they will still overcome them and will not let anything bring them down. J-Hope: They had to make sacrifices to get where they are, and they will get back up when faced with problems. Suga: They are willing to get back up and not let anything anybody does/says to bring them down. Jimin and Tae: Same message Chorus: Same message Jungkook: they have sacrificed a lot to get their success, and their perseverance would not stop anytime soon. they end the song by repeating their main message, they will persevere until the end and they will face anything thrown at them (metaphorically speaking) in life. again, this is just my theory, it is not correct.

            "answer_text": "I don't have any theories mostly because it stopped being interesting for me during the LY era and now I just care on casual level. Plus I didn't like the mv for On. If you're really interested, I think xCeleste and Bookish Theories on youtube make really good informative videos on BTS music videos and on their connecting storylines. ",
