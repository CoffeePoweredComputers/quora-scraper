            "answer_text": "I ha e been on the edge of living for a while now, a year or more. I joined for the music and the shows. I enjoyed the content, I enjoyed the music more than the western music at the time. The community was never something I was looking for because my personality doesn't really fit the overall style of the fandoms. I am not that vocal about kpop, and not that exclusive as fandoms seemed to be. What is pushing me away is the attitude of the fandoms. The superiority some people have, the extremes they go to and the good old \u201ccultural appropriation \u201c debates. When I joined, I did a lot of research about the Korean culture to understand what the attitude of people involved. It bothers me that most fans don't do that, but rather try to force their values and culture on kpop. While some points they are right, but still, different cultures have different pasts. What I would, and already kind of do, miss is the music and the shows. The entertainment. It is different from what the Western entertainment can offer. ",

            "answer_text": "There have been a few occasions where I was very close to just stop giving kpop attention. There are a lot of harmful and toxic behaviors going on almost every day. Degradation Towards IdolsI will use Hwasa as a prime example of this. I personally am very vocal about certain things certain idols have done involving the mockery of cultures, specifically POC. However, I also understand that some of its ignorance is understandable because you can\u2019t expect every person, from every country out there, to know about your culture/religion. I do draw the line though, when the idols keep doing it over and over again despite the fanbase speaking up. That I have a huge problem with. But with Hwasa is different. With Hwasa, her actions and comments get heavily taken out of proportion. I will not bring up the black face controversy as Mamamoo already apologized and that is done and over with. Recently, Hwasa got in a lot of trouble for something she didn\u2019t do. For something that people blindly took out of proportion, twisted to satisfied their hateful narrative because they thrive in fake wokeness and negativity. Hwasa was accused of appropriating Nigerian culture by wearing a dress that \u201clooked\u201d like Nigerian attire that women wear. However, it was proven that this was in fact NOT a Nigerian dress. But of course, even when faced with the facts, some kpop fans just never quit. When something new appears, they just gotta bring the whoooooole list because if they are going to bury someone, they will do it hard.   The BTS Hate Train \ud83d\ude82Yes, I shall speak about such topic. I know it\u2019s tiring but it must be said because it\u2019s very clear that this train keeps on going. It\u2019s a given that the bigger and more successful you are, the more haters you will have. But must one should let it slide and let it be? No. I have to say BTS and Mamamoo have got to be one of the most hated groups out there. But there\u2019s a difference, BTS hate train started rolling way back in the days. Their bullies were not kpop stans right away, it was the media. It didn\u2019t take long though, till the fandoms started to express their \u2026. discomfort towards a group that wasn\u2019t part of the Big3. Interesting that under dogs get you shaking when they don\u2019t even have enough power, aye? Seeing how big BTS is, the hate is none-stop. I know a lot of fans will ask, where? All I come across from kpop fans overall is how easily they brush this under the carpet unless it comes from an Army. Hating on BTS has become normalized, possibly a personality trait, and the fandom is often used as the main excuse. Notice how answers in Quora who tend to say negative things about BTS, and even Blackpink, get the most votes while the ones praising BTS either have less or mainly come from Army. Lately, the comments I read regarding a group that made it and survived through it, it gets tough. It gets tough when a lot of fans from different fandoms team up. For what reason? I don\u2019t know. Will the BTS hate train stop? Probably not. I hope. I wish.Danny Berry's answer to Which is the most heartbreaking moment of your K-pop bias group? These are the main reasons why sometimes I just wanna stay away. The groups have nothing to do with this but certain behaviors are too much. I don\u2019t think I would miss anything because I would still listen to the groups I love. ",
