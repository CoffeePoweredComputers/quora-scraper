            "answer_text": "They\u2019re really the same thing based upon application and, both musical and textual vocabulary but, for most people the word arpeggio has the connotation of distance. If I were to break up a chord within an octave, for me as a jazz player, I may envision it as an arpeggio but most likely I am somehow weaving it around a melody and would verbalize it as a broken chord. If I were to use a broken chord to ascend two or more octaves, I for sure would describe that as an arpeggio. Over the years many words have morphed meaning. Take the word \u201cpassion,\u201d for many in denotes love of something or someone but the word actually means \u201cto suffer.\u201d If you love something, you may suffer and sacrifice for it. To show compassion means to \u201cwith+suffer.\u201d Jesus\u2019 passion was his arrest, trial, torture and death.\u201d It had nothing but everything to do with love. When people say \u201cMusic is my passion.\u201d I just roll my eyes. One of my favorite licks to play is a two note \u201carpeggio.\u201d Something like a C to an F#, then the octave C, the next octave F#, etcetera. I\u2019ll do this for three or four octaves. For me, by definition it is neither broken chord nor arpeggio. It is just a piece of vocabulary I use to get from point A to point B. So yes, a broken chord or arpeggio is a piece of vocabulary. Here is a sample of me playing that \u201cbroken arpeggio.\u201d It is at 2:59  ",

            "answer_text": "An \u201carpeggio\u201d and a \u201cbroken chord\u201d are referring to the same thing- the notes of a chord played one after the other instead of at the same time like a \u201cblock\u201d chord. We use both interchangeably in English, however, when I see a squiggly line in front of a chord I interpret as a arpeggio that has to stay within the time indicated (in this case a quarter note) with the notes moving in one direction only. In guitar music sometimes you see this squiggly line with an arrow to determine whether the chord is arpeggiated (or broken) from low to high notes or high to low notes. If there's no arrow I usually interpret that as meaning low to high. I also don't take the squiggle to mean a specific rhythm like exact 32nd notes as written in your example but you might ask your teachers about that. (I'd be interested to hear from others if they feel the same.) In other words, I might play a very fast arpeggio with the chord sustaining for whatever time is left over. If the composer wants a specific rhythmic grouping it means the arpeggio should be written out fully. In contrast, arpeggios can also be played in many other ways besides straight up and down a chord- those patterns should be written out in full as the squiggle line doesn't indicate these many different variations.
