            "answer_text": "Well, your question made me pause and think\u2026.what exactly is ugly? What one person considers ugly might be handsome to another, a trip through the San Francisco Museum of Art will convince you of that! I answered another question tonight, and it was about how to be better looking\u2026..I said then and I maintain that I am right, that external beauty, well, it\u2019s fleeting\u2026.We\u2019re all just one fall, accident, car wreck, disease, house fire, explosion, cooking mishap, etc, away from ugly. And that\u2019s hard to really accept, because we imagine in our arrogance that looks are ours, they BELONG to us, we have a right to them, etc\u2026\u2026or just being blase, that they\u2019ll always be there. Except, they won\u2019t. It\u2019s not a given nor a guarantee. The only real beauty we can ever possibly have and keep in this life is inside. It is character, and strength. It is hope, and faith. It is the ability to pick yourself up off your butt no matter how many times you land there and soldier on. It is helping people weaker than you, and rising up in times of need. It is trying to be a positive light in a world that can seem very very dark and painful. Beauty is in the very soul of a person, and it can transcend all things. Your skin wrinkles and grows nasty spots as the years pass\u2026..your hair weakens and thins, turns gray\u2026\u2026.your bones, muscles, sinews, they too fail the test of time\u2026.only your spirit, and your character, that which sets you apart from others, can remain, and if you try to be a light, you really ARE beautiful\u2026.we don\u2019t all succeed in this quest, but I wish that we all will continue to try\u2026.. True beauty really does come from within\u2026..if you need a jolt of wisdom and good, as I often do, look up a video of Nick Vujicic and watch a REAL man in living, loving action\u2026.the \u201cNo arms no legs no problem\u201d guy\u2026\u2026sometimes when I feel down I watch this and suddenly, the real meaning of character and beauty are crystal clear\u2026.: ) ",
