            "answer_text": "You can easily get the lawsuit dismissed by showing prior use. Using a brand name prior to it being trademarked is a defense. Registration only limits new uses, not existing ones. Also, it only limits use in the specific class the registration was in (e.g. band name), so your use in the graphic novel would not be an infringement. Can I point out that if there are real people recording real music under this band name, then it isn't a fictional band. It is a real band, who you happen to be creating fictional stories for. Example: Spinal Tap (band) Real band names (and fictional names, both of individuals and of groups) are not typically trademarked. The use of the name on merchandise is however, but you actually have to make the merchandise first. Trademark registration requires you are actually using the brand name. Frankly, you should always be going through a lawyer when you get a trademark, specifically so they can answer legal questions like: do I need to do this for legal protection? ",
