            "answer_text": "Credibility. The industry is content to float along, buoyed by a music buying public that keeps buying music made to a formula, performed by people with mediocre musical abilities, but who succeed because of clever marketing and packaging. Do record companies even employ A&R men anymore? Looking from afar, there seems to be second tier of American musicians who will never be hugely successful, will never be signed to a major label, but who are streets ahead of the most popular \u201cpop\u201d artist in terms of playing the music, singing the music and writing the music. If you can\u2019t at least do one of those things with a high level of proficiency, you have no right to call yourself a musician. This is why I said the recording industry are lacking credibility. If someone doesn\u2019t fit into the formula as a recording artist, they will have nothing to do with them, but they are more than content to sell a hugely inferior brand of product to a gullible public. This has been going on for so long now because the recording industry knows that by the time one generation of consumers has aged and moved on, another one appears and they ( record companies ) only have to come up with another Justin Beiber clone to fill that market void. I know its a chicken and egg thing, but record companies have to take a lot of the blame for the mediocre quality of most of the recorded popular music that\u2019s coming out today. ",

            "answer_text": "It lacks music(sorry to say) but that\u2019s the devastating fact that our generation is facing today. I myself am a huge fan of music from Mozart or Beethoven classical to Led Zepplin or Deep Purple rock to M.J or Akon pop. My teenage friends all used to mutter those irritating songs of Wayne and Niki Minaj(again not trying to hurt anyone\u2019s feeling here so please bear with me) which had not even a feature to recognize that piece of shit as music. Lastly, I want to say that music should be kept in its own purity whether it be pop, rock, heavy metal, hip hop, classical, indie etc. ",
