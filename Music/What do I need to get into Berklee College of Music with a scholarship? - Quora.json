            "answer_text": "First, congratulations on being proactive when it comes to your application. It\u2019s a big step, and you should be proud. I graduated from Berklee last year, and I was enrolled there as an undergrad for five years with a presidential scholarship, which covers tuition, room, and board. Now, I work hard, I pride myself on my playing/composition ability, and I think I deserved the scholarship. However, the unfortunate reality is that there are many truly talented, hard-working people attending Berklee who also deserve such a scholarship, and aren\u2019t awarded one. Part of this has to do with chance or bad luck, or maybe getting assigned an auditioner who\u2019s having a bad day, but a lot of it has to do with demographics. This involves facing some unfortunate realities about the way Berklee awards scholarships. First, it matters which instrument you play, and what kind of music you play. If you provide something the school doesn\u2019t have much of - and which it requires to function - you will likely get a larger scholarship. For instance, although Berklee has made great strides in the past few years, the school isn\u2019t yet known for its elite-level symphonic orchestra players. It\u2019s traditionally been seen as a jazz/pop/rock school, and if someone wants to seriously study European classical music in Boston, they usually shoot for NEC or Boston Conservatory, which are mere blocks away. (Berklee has indeed merged with BoCo, but each college has separate applications and auditions.) Thus, Berklee, as a school that wants to be the best at everything, is looking to strengthen its orchestral department. And it\u2019s more likely to give stellar orchestral players bigger scholarships than stellar pop/rock musicians. Here are a few demographics Berklee has in abundance; female singer songwriters, male guitarists, male drummers, and male jazz players. Unfortunately, if you fit in one of these demographics, it\u2019s hard to get a full scholarship to Berklee. Don\u2019t worry, it can be done - and I\u2019ve seen it done - you just have to really blow them away in the audition. All of this is not meant to discourage you. And this is not to say you should change an integral part of who you are as a musician to get a scholarship. But there are certain skills Berklee is looking for, and if you have them, be sure to show them clearly at your audition. Skills Berklee Values, In Order Of Importance: Play or sing an instrument/specialize in a musical genre Berklee needs and lacks representation of, and perform it well. For instance, players of orchestral instruments and traditional folkloric international instruments are highly valued.Strong technical skill on your instrument. (It really helps if you\u2019re classically trained.)The ability to improvise well. If you have strong classical training and can also shred over complex changes, you\u2019re golden.Amazing ear training/sight-reading ability. These are valued skills, but if you\u2019re clearly a great musician, even if you lack these skills, you\u2019ll be recognized.Finally, there\u2019s that elusive quality that\u2019s really what everyone\u2019s looking for, but no one can really define - your unique, irreplaceable musical voice. If you have mind-blowing, game-changing artistic power - and shove it down their throats at the audition - it doesn\u2019t matter as much what you play or what genre you\u2019re in. They\u2019ll get it. I used both the pragmatic, \u201cfit their needs\u201d approach as well as the \u201cshow your true self\u201d approach when I auditioned, and I think that\u2019s what served me well. On the pragmatic side: I play violin and piano, and I\u2019ve been playing piano longer - but I auditioned on violin, because I knew they needed violinists. Since I\u2019m confident in my abilities on violin, I could adjust my presentation to fit their needs in that way. At the end of my audition, after I had won them over on violin, I asked politely if I could play piano for a minute, and they let me play. So in the end, I got to show them a balanced view of my skills. However, I remember a week before my audition in 2012, I called the auditions department and asked whether they would rather hear a jazz standard or an original composition as my \u201cprepared piece.\u201d Fearing, I think, a lack of structure and intent, they assured me I\u2019d do better with the jazz standard. However, they also told me to do whatever best showcased who I really am as an artist. So, after a day of thinking, I said \u201cscrew what they\u2019re expecting, they don\u2019t know me,\u201d and decided to perform a multi-genre, original improvisation with non-traditional techniques and no pre-composed ideas. After I finished, my auditioner said, \u201cwell, that was fun,\u201d and I just finished going to Berklee for free. So, to conclude, here\u2019s rule #1: At all costs, blow them the hell away. ",

            "answer_text": "Me, I got into Berklee, with not one, but TWO prestigious scholarships. But even with those, attending the school was still an extremely expensive venture anyway. To get a Berklee scholarship, much depends on the audio and video of yourself playing that you send to them with your application. They want to hear that you are not merely goofing off with music in order to attract members of the opposite sex, say, or doing it purely as a \"vanity\" crusade. They want to hear that you have spent most of your life playing your instrument, and have spent countless hours listening to good music of all kinds, from all of music history, not just the latest dopey fads. In my case, in 1987, I took a 4-track analogue cassette tape recorder, and using tape bounce alone, created a dense music mix with 8 layers of my own vocal harmonies, and many layers of synthesized background tracks. No, the result wasn't flawless, but then the auditioners know student submissions won't be, and that's why you are seeking their tutelage. The mix was a helluva lot of work, unlike today when it's a breeze, using DAWs that can be downloaded free off the 'Net. To get a scholarship, you have to show that you are more serious musically, and more hard-working, than the average Berklee applicant/aspirant, and probably already have years of music study and performance under your belt. I think the auditioners also want to sense that you have a real \"direction\" in music, already have some vision of what it is you want to achieve in the business. ",
