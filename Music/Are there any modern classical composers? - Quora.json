Universities and Conservatories have continued to produce and study classical music\u2019s development, which has continued from the Middle Ages and never stopped to the present. Now this is in no way a comprehensive list, but if you simply pick up a music history book, here\u2019s some of the renown composers they will list from the beginning of the twentieth-century to the present: (Before WWII) Debussy, Ravel, Scriabin, Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Stravinsky, Bartok, Hindemith, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Ives, Cowell, Barber, Copland, Crawford, Ruggles, Nancarrow, etc. etc. etc. (After WWII) Britten, Messiaen, Stockhausen, Boulez, Stockhausen, Xenakis, Cage, Brown, Ligeti, Penderecki, Lutoslawski, Young, Riley, Glass, Reich, Adams, Scelsi, Lachemann, Grisey, Mureil, Norgard, Saariaho, Gubaidalina, Gorecki, Part, Ferneyhough, Davies, Knussen, Crumb, Corigliano, Carter, Davidovsky, Babbit, Chen Yi, Daugherty, Bolcom, Albright, Schwantner, Druckman, Zhou Long, Isang Yun, (out of breath\u2026not even possible to list all the \u201cmajor\u201d composers here\u2026) These are all people commonly studied and performed many many many times every year\u2026..[sorry I did not list all the first names.] EDIT: I was not disparaging Film Music in this answer (in fact, film composers borrow and/or are influenced by many of the composers I just listed,) I was just presenting composers that are considered as a continuation of concert and art music as the way it is presented and taught universally in history classes throughout the world as well as who is included on concerts with other Classical repertoire from earlier eras. Second Edit: If you mean \u201cin the style of\u2026.\u201d then see my previous answer Michael Sidney Timpson's answer to Are there any contemporary composers that write in the baroque or classicistic style?

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u201cclassical.\u201d If you mean sounding like Mozart or Schubert, probably no. I recall a graduate student at UC Berkeley who improvised, pretty well, in a style that was Romantic, e.g., Liszt, Brahms. I don\u2019t know what became of him, because he didn\u2019t write his improvs down, just played them on piano. A former UCLA colleague, Richard Grayson, could do the same thing with Baroque music, but his own music was distinctly modern. On the other hand, if you mean composers of what I call \u201cconcert music,\u201d they are all around you. You just don\u2019t appreciate their work like you do earlier music. I don\u2019t think that means they aren\u2019t serious composers, they simply have taken on qualities of music of the 20th century, like Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff, Schoenberg, Cage, Feldman, et al. The repertoire of Kronos (the string quartet) is filled with examples that span the entire stylistic range of concert music, nearly all of it 20th century. ",

If what you mean by classical is a composer who writes music just like Mozart or Bach, then, no, there are none. Well, there may be a few, but their music is of little interest, and so their music is rarely if ever performed. However, among the composers writing some very engaging music these days are Randall Woolf, Frederick Rzewski, Elliot Carter (though recently deceased, he was writing music until the age of 103), Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin, Christopher Rouse, Richard Danielpour, Jennifer Higdon, Ellen Zwilich, Jonathan Dove, Fazil Say, York H\u00f6ller, Cheryl Frances-Hoad, and Kaija Saariaho. All worth checking into; they all have written some very engaging and beautiful music. ",

Why would a modern composer be interested in chewing over something that has already been done two centuries or more ago?If you mean by \u201cclassical\u201d the type of music performed in concert halls by symphony orchestras, operas, chamber music, etc. then, of course, there are thousands, tens of thousands, 100\u2019s of, or maybe millions of people writing what can loosely be described as \u201cclassical\u201d music.

Living composers such as John Adams, Phillip Glass, Jennifer Higdon and many others are composing works that have enduring characteristics and will very likely be played for many years hence. ",

While admittedly I haven\u2019t heard too many of his songs, his soundtrack to the 2012 remake Karate Kid was absolutely brilliant. Half a century from now, some emo teen is going to look back and say that he defined the 2000s classical scene. I guess from some perspectives, John Williams, the only movie soundtrack composer that requires no introduction, could also be considered a classical artist. His work on Harry Potter, for example, could almost certainly pass as the work of an early Beethoven if it wasn\u2019t so well known. ",

I studied modern classical music in college and loved it- but beyond my other composition student friends, no one else loved it. The other music students hated it and only played our stuff because their teachers told them it was good for them, and literally no one else in the university cared for us at all\u2026 not even the music of our professors or guest composers. The truth is that classical music is a dead genre. There are many reasons I think it's dead (I think musicians killed it and prefer it dead), but whatever the case, it's a genre dedicated to preservation rather than encouraging new voices. Now days I perform Gregorian Chant and write poppy modal music- I preserve what I need to preserve and innovate where innovation is welcomed. ",
