            "answer_text": "For some reason, I always assumed cotton eyed Joe was white. I will have to research more. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist if it\u2019s a white man singing about a white man. Perhaps a little stereotyping of the south, but not racist. Edit-upon research, Cotton Eyed Joe is a very old song. Possibly pre Civil War and was remade into a dance song. Hard for me to really tell what the lyrics were about! I don\u2019t think the men who remade it into a dance song were racist. I think they just felt the song sounded very \u201camericana.\u201d Perhaps the original authors of the song had some meaning behind it, but again from the lyrics it\u2019s hard to tell what it is about.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t make enough sense to be racist, seems to me. Its origin is from before the Civil War, and my understanding is that it was played and sung by African-Americans, which is why I\u2019m attracted to it\u2014not a lot of authentic African-American dance music from that era... There are a bunch of versions, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there were some with offensive lyrics, though I don\u2019t know any. ",
