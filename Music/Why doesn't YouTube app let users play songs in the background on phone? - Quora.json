YouTube doesn't.I guess, the reason could be, Red is made specially for music so it must've been optimized that way.YouTube, most of us, just YouTube songs and listen to them, so I guess, it puts useless load on their server from people like such.Moreover, YouTube is meant for videos, and not for music and there's not point in playing a video in background.",
