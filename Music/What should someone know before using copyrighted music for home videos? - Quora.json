            "answer_text": "Most recorded music is covered by a copyright. Using someone else\u2019s music in your video is copyright infringement, even if you don\u2019t sell or widely distribute the video. If it\u2019s a registered copyright, you can be fined a substantial sum if the copyright holder found out and chose to sue. Each use is potentially multiple infringements as there are different rights holders for music and lyrics, and adding music to a video requires \u201csynchronization rights\u201d. There is a lot of music out there for which the copyright holder has already granted permission for you to use their music. Creative Commons licensed music is a good example. You can generally obtain permission to use someone else\u2019s copyrighted music for your home video, sometimes for a small fee. There are a large number of royalty-free music sites on the Internet. If you use someone else\u2019s music in your home video and post it to sites like YouTube or Vimeo, even if it\u2019s not public, it\u2019s likely to be detected. Doing so is also a violation of the terms of service and can get the account suspended or removed. YouTube will sometimes simply remove the audio from the video to ameliorate the problem. ",

            "answer_text": "That published music is the property of someone (who I assume is not you) so if you use it without permission/payment then it is the equivalent of my using your car to drive myself around. You should technically ask permission before doing anything with published music but unless you use an online service or are Robbie Williams, expect to be ignored - which while not permission, makes it really hard to get permission. If the video is purely private in nature, as in it is only shown to your close family (and by that, I don\u2019t mean the population of New Zealand) then probably everyone will turn a blind eye. As soon as you put it in public like Facegram, YouTube, or play it at your business for visiting customers then you have started to profit from the work of another without paying them, which is of course as mightly uncool as your boss not paying you at the end of the week.
