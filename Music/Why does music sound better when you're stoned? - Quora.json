            "answer_text": "Everything is better when you're stoned! It just is. But...some people have actually taken time to \"study\" stuff like this, and figure it all out. It does make for an interesting read I must say. Why does music sound so good when we're high? There are many possible explanations for this phenomenon. The first is that cannabis acts on the area of the brain that processes auditory stimulation. When test subjects were exposed to burning cannabis leaves, they were able to better recall lyrics, understand differences in sounds and other nuances that make up musical pieces and make rhythms sound better. Some subjects even reported that the lines between the visual and auditory senses were blurred causing a sensation known as synaesthesia. Another possible explanation for this phenomenon is the fact that marijuana relieves stress. While relaxing the body and mind, it opens the channels that allow you to appreciate the music on a deeper level. When you are not worried about the stressors of the day or the other things that may be concerning you, you are able to focus on the message as well as the melody, rhythm and other sensations presented in the piece. A further explanation is that marijuana causes the brain to lose the ability to separate the relevant and irrelevant stimuli. Because of this, subjects in the aforementioned study reported noticing subtle differences in pitch that they had been unable to notice prior to this. Also, when closing their eyes, the subjects reported being able to arrange things by sounds, seeing colors and notes instead of geometric patterns. Still another reason is that music is a huge part of the ritual behind smoking marijuana. For many people, sharing a joint or a bowl starts with putting on just the right CD. As the smoke permeates the lungs, the music permeates the soul. The final reason that music may sound better when a person is high involves the artist. Many pieces of music were composed, preformed and recorded while under the influence of drugs, alcohol or other mind-altering substances. Because of this, an altered mind can often appreciate the subtle nuances better than an unaltered mind. In the end, it really doesn't matter why marijuana makes music sound more beautiful. What matters is that it does. So, turn on some tunes, light up a bowl, close your eyes and enjoy. **Just a reminder, no matter how high you get, Nickelback is still Nickelback, and they still suck.**  ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, Jon.   Both weed and music have powerful effects on mood.  Weed intensifies sensory perceptions and alters mood, among other effects, by attaching to receptors in the brain that normally respond to natural THC-like chemicals and over-stimulating parts of the brain that have the most receptors  -- in a word, it makes us high.  Colors seem brighter, emotions feel stronger, sex is more intense, and so forth.  You know what I mean. The truly fascinating part of the answer is how music alters mood.  There is increasing interest among researchers on this subject, especially because positive effects may be achieved without the use of drugs, that is, without medication.  Upbeat  music makes for an upbeat mood.  Our heartbeat changes in response to the rhythm of music, actually synching the heart's rhythm to that of the music.  Meanwhile, tone exerts such a powerful influence on the brain that the psyche feels the emotions communicated by music, whether cheerful or sorrowful. The word \"heartbeat\" must have an interesting etymology.  As soon as I finish here, I'll be dashing downstairs to check out the definition in my Webster's Third International Dictionary! It seems pretty apparent that listening to music while stoned combines two highs, one natural and the other induced by THC.  Your body reacts to the music in any case, and your reaction may be intensified by THC.  And thus, the music sounds better. Here is a little link on that:  How Music Affects Our Mood.  Hope this was a satisfactory answer.  It seemed a tad circular to me, but I did the best I could!  Thanks for the A2A. ",
