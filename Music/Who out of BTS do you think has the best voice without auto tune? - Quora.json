            "answer_text": "There is no correct answer to this question, this is purely subjective meaning it depends on a person\u2019s own taste in music. I\u2019m going to go through the vocal line individually. I am going to include videos which highlight their individual vocal abilities and moments that I think really reflect them vocally. Disclaimer: I am not a musical professional so this is just my opinion after decades of being a music enthusiast. This reflects my opinions not necessarily the truth and vocal talent is very subjective, we all have different tastes in music and what sounds good to our ears so I don\u2019t want to hear \u201cyou\u2019re so wrong blah blah\u201d because someone's opinion isn\u2019t wrong as long as they acknowledge it\u2019s just an opinion and not fact. We are allowed to have different opinions. Lets talk about Jin first. Jin was never really interested in being a singer before he got scouted so his vocals have improved the most in the group and he deserves a lot of respect for that. Honestly my opinion on his voice depends on the song. I LOVE Jin in TTU and other songs similar in style. Jin has a voice, as BTS members have said, that would really suit traditional Korean songs. He hits high notes great and just has an all around stable voice but in terms of uniqueness he isn\u2019t necessarily on top. I obviously don\u2019t mean that offensively he does sound great, and I think is the best at harmonizing in the group alongside JK with any member, vocal or rap. Jin\u2019s voice also doesn\u2019t get utilized as much as it should but that could be partly due to him not wanting as many parts and the pressure that comes with that. Unlike the others, he is never one who really talks about being born to be on the stage and living for performances. I think he truly only stays with BTS and sings for the other members who he loves like younger brothers. That got off topic but Jin has a good all around voice but it isn\u2019t necessarily unique or a stand out in the Kpop world.  Our WWH truly deserve the world, he worked so hard to get to this point and he\u2019s the one I\u2019m least critical of because he honestly never really wanted this like the other members. He was scouted, he didn\u2019t go to a bunch of auditions like the other members. He was hired as the visual but decided to put in the work and become a pretty dang good singer. Jungkook has what I kind of call a very mainstream, popular voice. He is the main vocal for a reason. He consistently hits all the notes and can perform live throughout an entire tour without any real noticeable flaws. He harmonizes amazingly with people and just has a voice that sounds great covering pretty much any genre because of his stability and range. That being said, I\u2019m going to go back to the mainstream point\u2026. his voice is not really all that unique. I know JK stans are about to come at me but I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s true. He is an amazing singer and can be probably the most successful of BTS members if he chooses to go solo but it\u2019s because his voice is very \u201cin\u201d. His voice reminds me of a lot of mainstream American artists to be honest. He doesn\u2019t have a crazy unique tone that makes his voice instantly recognizable and having a Korean accent I\u2019m sorry is not the same as having a unique tone. It may sound like I\u2019m being harsh but I\u2019m not. He will be successful no matter what he chooses to do singing wise because he has a great voice and unlike the rest of the vocal line he doesn\u2019t have to strain nearly as much, or at all, to sound so good and stable giving him longevity in his musical career. JK truly is talented in pretty much every musical aspect and was born to be an artist. I really can\u2019t wait to see what he chooses to do individually in the coming years because it will be amazing as long as his fans allow him some peace in life.  This is honestly my top JK moment of all time, it is so sexy. This mans vocal talent is undeniable. Taehyung\u2026I\u2019m gonna have to betray my bias here (please forgive me) and say that Taehyung\u2019s vocal style and tone is honestly my favorite. I am a massive Jazz fan and grew up on Jazz and his voice really was made for jazz and bluesy singer/songwriter music. He is the member I honestly think should have had a solo career because his voice doing jazz and r&b solo albums would be honestly probably some of the best in the world for his age and out of all BTS members his voice is truly misused the most. He often has to go way out of his range, which he has become pretty freaking great at, to match the way the song was written and to fit in with the rest of the vocal line. Because the other members have a higher voice (i think it\u2019s called pitch or tone idk don\u2019t sue me) than him he is constantly singing within their range and his voice in his natural range is honestly heavenly. His tone is incredibly unique not just in Kpop but in korea and the world as a whole. Not many people are born with a voice that was made for jazz and blues but this man was gifted that voice and I want to see him utilize that more.  This video is so underrated, yes he was kidding around but I don\u2019t think people understand how truly good his voice is when he\u2019s singling within his register. His voice is so deep and gorgeous.  Yes, people make fun of his accent here and I think there\u2019s a bit of autotune (maybe not) but ignore the non perfect accent and this could literally sell out on American Christmas albums because of how good his voice sounds. People really sleep on how this mans voice was made for jazz and it gets me mad. Jimin is my bias not just for his personality and looks but because his voice in my so humble opinion is the most unique. Not just unique for a man but unique regardless of gender and nationality. In their tiny desk concert so many comments were from people who didn\u2019t know BTS asking about who Jimin was and how shocked they were that a man had that voice. I\u2019m not gonna argue the whole \u201che sounds feminine/masculine\u201d because people of both genders can have deep and high pitched voices so I hate people who stereotype voices based on gender norms. So not only does he have a naturally high pitch, but his voice is just unique. I honestly don\u2019t know how to describe it and like V his voice is so misused by BTS in my opinion. They put him on these constant high notes which strain the crap out of his voice especially when he is dancing his heart out at the same time. He is also the most criticized for his voice and like Jin has improved an incredible amount from his rookie days and deserves so much credit.  This moment is underrated. His voice is crazy unique, man or women. He\u2019s kidding here and he literally sounds so good while joking around. When he sang the last lines \u201cstarting today, I hate Hobi\u201d I was like WOW. I want to hear that on a track I\u2019m not kidding. ALSO RM coming in with those background vocal lol, we love our leader. Okay lets get serious with Jimin.  I did an acapella video so no one tries and say \u201cAUTotuNE\u201d. This man has vocals. The second part of this video with JK in the practice room is honestly one of my all time favorite moments, I want to here Jimin singing in this style on songs not always forced to these apex high note moments requiring crazy breath control on top of being out of breath from dancing. If Jimin\u2019s style isn\u2019t for you that\u2019s fine we all have different tastes and expectations but his voice is incredibly unique, especially for a man and that is undeniable. ",

            "answer_text": "For me it\u2019s either JK or Jin. Both of them have the most stable live voices, and have the best flow imo. To be honest, I actually prefer JK\u2019s voice without autotune, or at least I prefer his voice when he sings acapella as opposed to his solo songs. Jin is a little different since he doesn\u2019t really sound that different with or without autotune, and his acapella voice sounds really similar to his voice in his solo songs. JK is easily the best vocal in BTS, no questions asked. He\u2019s not my bias or bias wrecker, and from a completely objective point of view I can clearly say he is the strongest vocal. However, I don\u2019t really like his solo songs because of the breathy way he sings in basically all of them. Euphoria, in my opinion, is his only decent solo song that I wouldn\u2019t skip (I don\u2019t hate his songs or him guys! It\u2019s just that the other official solo songs are not my taste.) I actually really, REALLY like Still With You and to this day I\u2019m upset that it\u2019s not a published solo song, because if it WAS, it\u2019d be my most played BTS song for sure. Anyways, the thing is, I don\u2019t know if his solo songs count as his voice \u201cwith autotune,\u201d but I\u2019m assuming it does because he sounds really different when he sings acapella. His cover of Never Not and those random moments where he\u2019ll sing in the middle of a live or whatever really bring out the pure, crisp vocals that I prefer. So I think JK has a gorgeous voice when he sings acapella. Jin on the other hand IS my bias, and he\u2019s also my ult, so I guess this might be a little more biased than my review of JK, but I\u2019ll try to keep it as straightforward as possible. Jin has really impressively stable live vocals and a really sweet undertone. My biggest gripe with Jin\u2019s voice would probably be that he isn\u2019t nearly as smooth up in the high register as JK is when he\u2019s singing live or acapella. He\u2019s also a little breathy in some of his songs, like in This Night or whatever that one was called. However, his acapella voice, imo, is almost the same as his voice in the songs. So basically, if you didn\u2019t read all that, I\u2019m going to go with Jungkook. ",
