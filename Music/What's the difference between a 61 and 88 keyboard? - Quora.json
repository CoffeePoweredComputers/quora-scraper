            "answer_text": "There is a HUGE difference! A 61 keyboard doesn\u2019t have as many keys, 27 to be precise, as an 88 keyboard. This means that when you play more difficult pieces that span higher registers, with a 61 keyboard, you literally can\u2019t play the piece. I honestly don\u2019t really understand why keyboards with less than 88 keys are a thing, and why so many people buy them. Keyboards are technically sort of a cheaper version of the piano. This means they\u2019re made to resemble the piano, and having less keys is like utterly defeating the purpose of how it\u2019s supposed to be like a piano. When I was younger, I got a keyboard that had around 50 something keys. I tried it a few times and then it went into the basement storage. The keyboard pissed my off so much because I literally couldn\u2019t play my piano pieces on it. Hmm, a B octave chord that goes into the lower two octaves? Can\u2019t play it, too low. An arpeggio going into a high C in the upper three octaves? Can\u2019t play that either. 27 keys may not seem like a lot, but that is more than 3 octaves that the keyboard doesn\u2019t have. There is such a huge, drastic difference between 61 and 88 keyboards. ",

            "answer_text": "27 more keys!Seriously, piano music is written for pianos with 88 keys, and even though you don\u2019t always use all of them, there are frequently situations where you need the keys that a 61-key keyboard doesn\u2019t have. If you play jazz, you will enjoy the full keyboard perhaps even more. A full 88-key keyboard provides space for full expression of musical ideas. Whenever I have to play a short keyboard; even one with 76 keys, I find it to be a frustrating experience as I naturally reach for keys that aren\u2019t there. It is something like two people sleeping in a twin-size bed! ",
