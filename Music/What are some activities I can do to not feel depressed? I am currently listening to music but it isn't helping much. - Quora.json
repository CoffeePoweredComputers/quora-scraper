Now coming to your problem you said you are listening the music but it isn't working. Now just think why are you depressed, is the reason is valid, for which you are depressed and in last just think about your mother and father and your loved one. First of all about your mother she gave you birth by facing so much hurdles. She had kept you in her womb for nine months and what your doing you are just putting all these things aside and becoming the salever of the depression. And go outside and watch how the people are fighting for even single seconds to live.

Everything is fine and will remain fine untill and unless you are not becoming slaver of this depression. And in last thank you for reading my ans. ",

            "answer_text": "Depression is so tricky to deal with sometimes. Exercise will definitely help. Sometimes just sitting outside in the sun helps me. Also, journaling. I try to do that about once a week, I mention any crazy spikes in negative emotions. Talking to someone you trust can help (so long as they are understanding). ",
