            "answer_text": "As a musician, I am a huge advocate for Music Therapy and listening to music in general for anyone. I believe that listening to music is great for mental health. Sometimes when I struggle with expressing my own emotions in a healthy way, music can serve as a way of speaking to how I feel and can relate to me to when I feel alone. Scientifically speaking, music improves cognitive performance, reduces stress, improves memory, helps sleep, and can also improve motivation and mood. \u201cIn one 2013 study, participants took part in one of three conditions before being exposed to a stressor and then taking a psychosocial stress test\u2026The results suggested that listening to music had an impact on the human stress response, particularly the autonomic nervous system. Those who had listened to music tended to recover more quickly following a stressor.\u201d The type of music can affect all of this, usually classical music or softer music will be more calming, but music can also help motivate for working out or getting other tasks done. Find music that you like and relate to, and make different playlists organized by mood (Play When Sad, Feeling Happy Playlist, Workout Motivation, etc.). ",
