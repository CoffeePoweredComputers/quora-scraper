            "answer_text": "Here are (most of) the ways I discover music:1. Find a genre or artist on iTunes / Spotify / Bandcamp or what have you. Browse through the list.2. Find articles on Wikipedia on an artist/band, genre, music label, etc, and browse through the bands mentioned.3. Find a genre label's or artist's/band's article on Last.FM, and browse through the recommended artists.4. There may be sites cataloguing the music of specific genres, such as Encyclopaedia Metallum (Metal Archives) for heavy metal music, and Prog Rock Archives for Progressive Rock and Progressive Metal. I am not aware of others. But, these are worth exploring from time to time. They often have reviews of music as well.5. Find a music newssite / blog / video channel / forum. The genre-specific and the more obscure sites are preferable, in my opinion. They are worth it for more than just music news, reviews and interviews. There are often opinion pieces on various aspects of the music & associated culture, as well as articles on topics not relating to music.[For example, since I mostly listen to extreme metal music, I frequent the blogs No Clean Singing, The Monolith, and Metalbase India.]6. Find the social network pages or blogs of the artists/bands that you like. If they are active, they might have good recommendations. This applies to the Bandcamp pages of bands as well - they often recommend other albums on Bandcamp, these recommendations being visible on download pages.7. Get familiar with music performance venues nearby and keep a watch on the announcements. The local talent may surprise you. This applies to the bars and colleges, in addition to venues meant for large-scale events.8. Do take notice of soundtracks and scores of films, TV shows, video games, etc. You may find interesting artists/bands whose music is included in the soundtracks. You may find some of the work of the score-composers interesting. In any case, try to actively listen to music - dedicating time to listen without doing anything else. Don't just let it play in the background while working, driving, working out or whatever. And take your time with any piece of music - don't just move on to something new after a few listens just for the sake of finding something new. ",

            "answer_text": "I find genres through wikipedia. Usually the genre pages have suggestions of artists like this page for jazz pianists List of jazz pianists. Then I will look up these artists on Grooveshark or Page on deezer.com. I also use http://Last.fm to get a picture of the type of music a band plays. My Grooveshark account is connected to my http://Last.fm account, so whatever I listen on grooveshark is recorded in Listen to free music and watch videos with the largest music catalogue online. Then Listen to free music and watch videos with the largest music catalogue online makes suggestions based on the artists I listen to.  Another way I discover music is listnening to DJ mixes through Mixcloud - Making radio better . Check out this DJ mix of Prog Rock , very good shit Prog Rock Session. Another way is listening to internet radio. Usually you can find your genre radio station , and they display the artists with the title of songs when they play them. The DJ mixes and the Internet radio are very new to me. Try this technique out , its very effective. Let me also mention that on Grooveshark there is a functionality similar to internet radio called Broadcasts. Search for your favourite genre and you will find compilations made by other users. Page on deezer.com helps you find music as well.  And then there is Youtube. You can find all kinds of mixes and videos on youtube of your favourite bands/genres. ",
