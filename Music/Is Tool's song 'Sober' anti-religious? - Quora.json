            "answer_text": "Depends how you think about it. It has an amazing double meaning. For example \u201cMother Mary, won\u2019t you whisper, something but the past is done.\u201d If you see it as a command towards Mary, then it might be. However, Maynard has said that the song is about somebody who is only interesting when drunk, and boring when sober. When looked at this way, it is more likely that \u201cMother Mary\u201d or \u201cJesus\u201d are simply exclamations. This said, their song \u201cOpiate\u201d is certainly anti-religious. ",
