            "answer_text": "The Beatles first album \u2018Please Please Me\u2019 was famously recorded in one day! The Beatles then proceeded to compile their future albums by recording tracks in between gigs. They tried to release an album at Christmas for their fans \u2018Beatles for Sale\u2019 is a good example a compilation of rock and roll classics and some Lennon & McCartney originals. They avoided putting singles on their UK albums because they felt they were ripping off the fans who had already bought the song. This was not the case with Beatle albums released in the USA. The record company Capitol cut up UK Beatle albums and added fillers like singles A and B sides and EPs. They cut songs and compiled albums that were not released in the UK. Even albums with the same name like \u2018Help\u2019, \u2018Rubber Soul\u2019 and \u2018Revolver\u2019 had different track compilations. Back to your original question after \u2018Please Please Me\u2019, the groundbreaking \u2018Rubber Soul\u2019 was the first album they made in one continuous period in the studio. The same with \u2018Revolver.\u2019 However, it is \u2018Sargent Pepper\u2019 that takes the cake. That iconic classic took about 6 months. The Beatles UK and US albums are an interesting subject please come with any comments if you have experienced anything connected to their albums. ",

            "answer_text": "It would depend on what album. The first albums they made were done in just days. When it came to Sgt. Pepper it was a whole collection of songs and ideas that they had been working on for as long as they were a band. I don\u2019t think they \u201cmade,\u201d albums as it were. I think they would just keep going into the studio with stuff as they were working on whatever theme or maid idea of a project and then assemble the finished songs in the editing. Abbey Road and Let it Be were just collections of tunes they had already recorded. And the albums we got in the States were different from the Albums they released in Britain. I used to know why one new album would have half of an older album on it. The way Capitol Record producers would butcher their albums was notorious. To the point that I know someone who witnessed George Harrison carrying the master tapes for the White Album to Los Angeles, to watch over the engineers to make sure the songs the Beatles wanted went on one double album. They were afraid that Capitol Records would try to make 4 Beatle albums out of one Double album. Even though Capitol could claim that the double album was only one album and that the Beatles still owed them however many albums the original contract with Capitol called for. It was all very complicated. John felt pressure from Capitol for another album Capitol and contracted for until the day he died. He once showed a letter demanding such an album to a friend of his. He called the pressure he was under, \u201cCapitol Punishment.\u201d It was not easy being a Beatle. ",
