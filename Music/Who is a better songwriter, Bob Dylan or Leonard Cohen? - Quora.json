            "answer_text": "Leonard Cohen wrote beautiful songs, no question about it. Nonetheless, he learned to do what he did early and he stayed with it to the end. Cohen took few chances with his songs. His work is heavy on metaphor which seems designed to be accessible to every listener. Far and away his most complex song is Famous Blue Raincoat which really does get the listener thinking but it is also pretty clear what the song alludes to. Cohen writes every song in the same minor 6th heavy chord structure and nearly all have very similar melodies. Dylan, on the other hand, has taken tremendous chances throughout his career. Dave Van Ronk said he did not think much of Blowing In the Wind when he first heard Dylan sing it at Folk City. Then he went out to Washington Square the following day and heard a kid parodying it: \u201cThe answer my friend is blowing out your end.\u201d Van Ronk realized that if it was inspiring parody before it was even recorded the song might have legs. Initially Dylan wrote songs designed to outrage the status quo, The Times They Are a\u2019Changin\u2019, Masters of War, the Ballad of Hollis Brown, Only a Pawn in Their Game, etc. and he got the attention of the status quo as well as the attention of those eager to break it up. Immediately he started backing away from all that with To Ramona, My Back Pages, and Chimes of Freedom. Then Dylan decided to \u2018go electric,\u2019 completely alienating his core fans with songs like Subterranean Homesick Blues, It\u2019s All Over Now Baby Blue, Bob Dylan\u2019s 115th Dream. When he launched the iconic Highway 61 Revisited including Like a Rolling Stone, classified by the rock press the most influential rock song in history, he was literally and figuratively booed on stage\u2026 yet he never faltered. He upped the ante with Blond On Blond, unquestionably the greatest surrealistic collection of songs anyone has written yet. He withdrew from the public at the height of his career to raise a family releasing a collection of cover songs roundly criticized but today considered another icon in recording history. In the mid 70s after his divorce he released Blood On The Tracks, Desire and Street Legal, that contain many of his most memorable songs, nothing like those on Blond On Blond or prior either structurally, arrangement wise or lyrically, completely unique even to Dylan. Then he made the absolutely crazy decision to throw over his core audience again and sing to Christians. This gave us Serve Somebody (for which he won his first of 11 Grammies), Every Grain of Sand, Caribbean Wind, The Groom\u2019s Still Waiting at the Alter, and They Killed Him. Even if, like myself, Christianity doesn\u2019t resonate with you, these are still some of the most powerful songs of Dylan\u2019s illustrious career. In 1999 Dylan won the Grammy for Record of the Year with his unbelievably intense Time Out of Mind with songs as diverse as the painful Lovesick and the humorous but thought provoking Highlands. In recent years he\u2019s given us songs like Jokerman, Sweetheart Like You, Sundown On the Union, Dark Eyes, Tight Connection to My Heart, Mississippi, Floater, Spirit On The Water. His most recent recording of original songs, 2012\u2019s Tempest, is completely packed with gems Soon After Midnight, Pay In Blood, Early Roman Kings and the troubling and thought provoking Roll On John, his tribute to John Lennon, in my opinion the most meaningful and honest tribute so far offered to the man. Honestly, how can you compare Leonard Cohen\u2019s pretty but redundant body of work to Dylan\u2019s? There is no other artist within a light-year of \u201cthe unwashed phenomenon.\u201d It was not for nothing Dylan was awarded both a Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for Literature. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a query for you Quora folks. You compare Bob Dylan to Leonard Cohen as to who is the better songwriter as the question is posed and you offer variously valued descriptions of the work of either songwriter. I propose a different and what I believe to be a more specific and more evocative method to compare the talents of the two songwriters. It works like this . He who thinks Dylan is better picks five of Dylan\u2019s best songs. He who champions Cohen as the better songwriter also picks his best five songs . Then both parties simply describe why their picks offer superior artistry compared to those songs offered by the other\u2019s artist of choice . Now I know different people would differ to some extent as to what the best songs of each artist might be but that is not a large problem . These can vary. I just think that if the actual songs are presented and defended as artistically superior just the mention of the songs and then a short discussion of their relevant qualities can really help people decide the question at hand . After all the memory of posterity will be decided by the peak production , the greater meaning and or beauty of each artist\u2019s oeuvre if you will. What songs are most evocative to you and why that is so in comparison and debate artist v artist. ",
