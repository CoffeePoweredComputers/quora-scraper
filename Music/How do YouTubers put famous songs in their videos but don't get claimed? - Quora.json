C: they used the material in a way that falls under the umbrella of \u201cfair use,\u201d which is a term in copyright law for certain exceptions to the rules. The most common form of fair use is parody. If you're making fun of the content you\u2019re ripping, you don't need the rights to the content. D: their video was claimed, and you just don't know about it. E: The owner of the music in question is not doing the work necessary to allow YouTube to automatically search for offenders with the content ID system. F: through editing techniques, they have altered the original content significantly enough to fool YouTube\u2019s content ID system. ",

The ones that have the rights of music must challenge the content id by sending the written permision for right usage of the particular music. Bottom line : if you put music , videos etc etc that are not yours you will have your youtube account terminated . PERIOD ",
