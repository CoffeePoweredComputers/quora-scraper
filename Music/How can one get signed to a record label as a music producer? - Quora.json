            "answer_text": "The problem in modern music industry is that there are more and more music producers coming into picture each day and not all of them are equally talented. Marketing and exposure hence matters more than the actual talent of the artist especially in the genre of EDM. Getting signed to a record label, at least a free one is both challenging and crucial for a sustainable career in music production. However, having a good knowledge base of music theory and sound design along with composition and production skills is more important than anything else. If you think that your music is up to the mark, considering the quality requirements of a record label you should start getting feedback on your work too. There are many contests like like Spinnin\u2019 Records\u2019 Talent Pool contest and demo submissions for Revealed Recordings, Monstercat, NoCopyrightSounds etc. but they need some marketing strategies and sometimes capital investment for you to ever get signed. AMATEUR RECORDS is an independent free Record Label that offers publishing of royalty free, no copyright music for exposure and marketing. You can submit your music for verification and assignment to AMATEUR RECORDS for free and it will be distributed over platforms like YouTube and SoundCloud. Get connected to this startup record label and give a kickstart to your career by getting signed. Let\u2019s make music industry a better place together by building a community of talented and deserving artists. Submit your best work to us\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Treat music like business. Where are people finding your genre of music? Many times, I produce Future Bass. So i will be intrested in question, \u201cWhere people are going for future bass songs?\u201d. Is it from youtube, is it soundcloud or is it spotify. Identify where the audience cones from and target it with your music.Make avprofessional, unique sounding music. Make sure your mixes are as loud as professional tracks and you don\u2019t sound like any amateur artist.Promote your music in a different way. If your friend makes youtube videos, tell him to use one of your songs in his vidoes and make sure he puts your name & channel link in credit section. So if viewers like music, they can check out your channel. You can actually pay a youtuber to use your music in their videos.If you are not a big artist, release a remix of a fresh song before you release your original. This can get you a significant amount of traffic on your channel as people will be searching remixes of that song and if they like your remix, that subscribe button should be irresistable for them.You can name your song after a well known song. If viewers are searching that song on youtube, your song will also pop out along with that song. That increases your chances to be recognised.Hope this helps. I got this tips from Zen World on his blog Evosounds. Check him out on youtube, he is amazing. Aaditya. Peace out!!! ",

If it\u2019s the former then what you do is you send the label your music and ask them if they\u2019re interested in releasing it. Even if they are it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll sign you up to a long term contract. Usually they\u2019ll prefer to sign just the tracks that they like. It\u2019s only once you\u2019ve built a history of releases and have an eager audience for your new music that any label would want to risk signing any longer term contract. If it\u2019s the latter then it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll get any type of long term contract. Your only contracts will be on a project by project basis. ",

So get writing and recording with other artists and publish that music. When you\u2019ve had some success and it looks like you are capable of having far more success then they will be ringing you.

Labels mainly doesn\u2019t hire producers unless they are one of the tycoon ones like Sony, Universal and Warner Bros or their subsidiaries. Anyhow, you don\u2019t need a record label really to demonstrate your work through. You can simply start to sign with music PR and digital marketing agencies, who will handle your work and plan your ideas and start to promote for you among several music platforms and through social media platforms as well. There are hundreds of companies that you can work with them, some are so specialized in specific music genres and others are not. My advice you can even sign with different ones at once. Here are some: Music & Events PR Specialists for Rock and Metal (UK)Team Clermont \u2022 Music PR, Publicity, Radio Promotion (USA)ROCKSHOTS Records (Italy)Soundpollution web-butik (Sweden)BJF Media | Music PR and Promotion (UK)Darren Rose - Home (USA)Loud Life Scene (Croatia)Also, my music PR and promotional services online agency, Naqada Music Management.

Sometimes it\u2019s just having your beat discovered by a big artist then the label finds out about you. There\u2019s so many different paths, but you have to start by making original, unique beats and list them on Beat Stars and start to market yourself and get noticed. It takes years sometimes, so don\u2019t stop. The main problem I\u2019ve seen with producers and artists is they get lazy or stop when they release some tracks and don\u2019t have success. ",
