            "answer_text": "Note: A user here requested me to answer this question \u2014 and it\u2019s very similar to another question I answered (it was asking how to get a waist like Ros\u00e9\u2019s instead). I\u2019m just going to copy and paste my answer here with the appropriate changes as I find that the answers are very much the same! \u2014- I\u2019m actually quite flattered someone requested me to answer this but here we go! Although I would personally say that you don\u2019t have to change your body \u2014 I\u2019m quite sure you\u2019re beautiful the way you are, and that you don\u2019t need a body like Ros\u00e9 to verify that. If you do need to though, I would say exercise would do the trick. Any BLINK would know that in comparison to most idols, they luckily do not have to diet as much. Taking references from Weekly Idol, the girls eat three times a day (along with supper)! In Blackpink House, the girls ate a lot. Which made me really happy of course, it\u2019s nice to know that a diet isn\u2019t imposed on them \u2014 take note that they do of course eat healthy as well, there were vegetables if I recalled right so that needs to be considered. Ros\u00e9 in particular eats a lot \u2014 which might be shocking given her figure right (and if I recall well, she seemed to like peppers a lot in Blackpink House). The reason why I would reckon exercise is because the members have done it themselves. Jennie and Jisoo have even uploaded photos of themselves doing flying yoga, and Lisa is probably occupied with dancing to help keep her figure. Ros\u00e9, on the other hand, mentioned she was exercising a lot in preparation for Ddu Du Ddu Du on VLIVE \u2014 she also mentioned pilates in particular. (edit: Lisa kept herself fit by doing boxing) Take note that if you do have the chance to invest in these exercises, we all have different metabolisms. Lisa and Ros\u00e9 have been pegged as two of the skinnier members in comparison to Jennie and Jisoo \u2014 so it might not come as a surprise that even if Ros\u00e9 does eat a lot, her high metabolism is probably what\u2019s keeping her stay in shape. Aaand that\u2019s pretty much it! Figure out a diet plan first and foremost, keeping in mind the type of metabolism and schedule you have as well. If you can invest in the exercises they have, then go for it. If not, I\u2019m sure there alternatives you can consider along that. As mentioned however, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re amazing the way you are, with a body like Ros\u00e9\u2019s or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, if you're not Asian or of Asian descent, having a figure like Ros\u00e9 would most likely be unhealthy. Asians can manage lower BMIs then non Asians. In fact Asians are considered overweight at a lower BMI than non Asians. Also, overweight Asians have an increased risk (50%), of overweight related diseases. If you are Asian or of Asian descent, the safest way to look like Ros\u00e9 and stay that way would be to adopt a Whole Plant Food based diet or as close as possible. This way of eating is high in all essential nutrients and naturally low in fat making maintaining a healthy weight relatively easy. Also, do 90 minutes of moderate physical activity everyday. For more information on a whole plant food based diet, search on the net for it. if you're looking for the medical scientific basis for this diet or just want more information on it, I'd recommend you check out the videos on nutritionalfacts.org.
