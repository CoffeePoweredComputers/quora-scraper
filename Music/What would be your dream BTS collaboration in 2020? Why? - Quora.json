They both are my all time favorite bands\u2026.I think it will be a legendary collaboration if both of the groups really collaborate. They both create such amazing music\u2026.just imagine our one and only savage rapper Jendueki rapping along with Yoongi, the cold rapper with swag and RM the rapper who spits fire\ud83d\udd25 And Jisoo and Ros\u00e9 singing with the king of high notes, our mochi Jimin, our Mom Jinnie, TaeTae and our golden Kookie, Jungkook. Lisa and Jhope, the dance machines of their groups having dance breaks together and setting the stage on fire\ud83d\udd25 I really want this to come true. With their MV breaking records in Youtube and creating history in KPOP. But sadly I don't think this will come true because of YG and some other stuff. But if this comes TRUE RIP MEE!!! ",
