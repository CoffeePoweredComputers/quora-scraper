            "answer_text": "On a six-string neck, for example, on lap steel guitar, C6 tuning is most usually C-E-G-A-C-E, bass to treble and going away from the player. Some other six-string C6 tunings are: A-C-E-G-C-E. G-C-G-A-C-E. Here are some common slide (open) tunings: Reference: Standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E (Eric And Duane's Guitar Beats Everything)Open G: D-G-D-G-B-D (the most common slide tuning, EC's favorite Dobro tuning).Open E: E-B-E-G#-B-E (Duane's favorite tuning, Delta Blues, stress for the neck) or open D with capo at 2nd fret.E9 tuning is a common tuning for steel guitar necks of more than six strings. ... A popular E9 tuning for eight string table steel guitar is the western swing tuning E-G#-B-D-F#-G#-B-E, low to high and near to far. Harmon Davis playing steel guitar The Lap steel guitar is not tuned in standard guitar tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E, low to high). Rather, it is usually tuned to an open chord, often an extended chord like a 6th, 7th, or 9th. (All tunings are shown low-to-high; that is, thickest string to thinnest, or 6th string to 1st string). The earliest Hawaiian lap steel tuning was A low bass, E A E A C# E. Blues and Rock players tend to favor one of two tuning families: open G/open A, or open D/open E. Open G is tuned D-G-D-G-B-D; open A raises each of those notes a whole-step (2 frets) to E-A-E-A-C\u266f-E. During the 1920s and 1930s, much of the sheet music written for lap steel utilized open A tuning as the de facto standard tuning for the instrument. Other tunings such as E7 ( B D E G# B E ), C#m (B D E G# C# E), and many other tunings were developed. Open D is tuned D-A-D-F\u266f-A-D, and open E is a whole-step higher: E-B-E-G\u266f-B-E. Joe Perry of Aerosmith uses Open E on his electric lap steel. David Lindley is another player who uses transposed variations of these tunings. any of the open tunings for regular 6-string guitar would work like open D or open G or E just to make it easier to find things on the neck ..or lap as it were.hOpe that helps.try some Rolling Stones tunes\u2026there\u2019s lotsa lap steel in there.",

            "answer_text": "Gerald below here has given you some good answers on different, common ways to tune a six-string lap steel guitar and also points to the fact that a lap steel guitar is typically tuned as described. Now you can (theoretically) tune a lap steel any way you want, including standard E, A, D, G, B, E. This however, makes little sense as there are very limited - ways to play full three note chords. Sure, you can play both minor and major chords, but you are very limited with inversions and even more limited when it comes to playing around with open strings (a major part of dobro and lap-steel playing), Personally, I some times play slide guitar in standard tuning but never when it comes to lap steel. The tunings I prefer are open E (or D), open A (or G) and a modified C or C6 tuning. I prefer to have the lap steel tuned to the key of the song (like in E if the song is in E). You will most often find that any decent guitar player understands the idea of an open tuning as opposed to standard E -E. It really doesn\u2019t take much time to get your head around it! Like for instance if you take a regular open A-chord, you will see that the low E, A and high E strings are open, while you play the D, G and B strings on the second fret. In other words, of you tune the D, G and B string up a whole note (two steps) and strum all strings, you will end up with the same chord - an open A. I really is no advanced theory or mystery behind it. However, the thing that takes time on a lap steel is to play it confidently and in tune, both single notes and chords. It also requires quite a bit of practice to dampen the notes you don\u2019t want to sound and also to get a god vibrato going. To understand the layout of a tuning and the subsequent chords and scales isn\u2019t that hard. To play the instrument convincingly takes time - just like regular guitar :-) ",
