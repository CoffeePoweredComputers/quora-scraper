            "answer_text": "In what way you are interested in becoming part of a music video? If you are the artist you can obviously participate once agreed with the video production company. If you are an actor or a model you can most likely arrange with your agent to get you a job on a video too. You can also become a producer as well if you want and create your own music video. You can become sponsor for a music video. You can do all the above if you are talented enough in more than one areas, and can support financially the project. Good luck! ",
