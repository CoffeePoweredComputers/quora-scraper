            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t. Copyright exists the moment a work is created in a tangible form, whether physical or digital. Thus, the idea of \u201cnon-copyright\u201d anything is a farse. There\u2019s music that is royalty free, in the sense you have to pay to get the track but owe nothing else\u2026 There\u2019s music that is offered for free, where you can download it and use it at no cost. I offer some of these tracks; many composers do. Incompetech is a big source of free music. There\u2019s music that has lapsed into the public domain. Keep in mind, though, that just because the piece itself has lapsed into public domain, the recording may have not. If the Phoenix Symphony records Mozart\u2019s Requiem, that recording is theirs to do with as they please. I made a video on copyright as it pertains to YouTube. You may find it useful:  Getting back to your original question: there\u2019s no such thing as copyright free music\u2026Marion has some good points re: where you can find Creative Commons tracks. A Google search will be helpful on that front. ",
