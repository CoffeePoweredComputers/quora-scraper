            "answer_text": "Psychedelia is in the ear of the beholder, but telltale signs of psychedelic rock usually include unusual sounds and timbres (e.g., sitars, fuzz tone, mellotron, electronically distorted sounds), upwardly moving melodies that give the sensation of \"flight,\" oscillating or lurching rhythms, slowed-down rhythms, speeded-up rhythms, abrupt changes in rhythm to signify disorientation, use of musical modes that sound \"Oriental\" or \"Indian,\" lyrical references to bright colors, and an inward lyrical focus on the singer's interior life. Psychedelic influences start to creep into the Beatles' work in 1965, but they haven't necessarily produced any full-fledged psychedelic songs by then. The songs from 1965 most likely believed to have some psychedelic influence, but probably can't be classified as fully psychedelic, include: Help! (recorded April 13, 1965; one theory has it that it was inspired by the soul searching that John Lennon did after his coffee was dosed with LSD by George's dentist in March 1965; not too psychedelic, but supposedly written as a Roy Orbison-style ballad that later became more uptempo)Norwegian Wood (recorded October 12, 21, 1965; except for George's sitar, it was more inspired by American folk rock than psychedelic drugs per se)Day Tripper (recorded October 16, 1965; uses \"trip\" as a drug double entendre, but otherwise more influenced by R&B than psychedelia)The Beatles' purest psychedelic period doesn't begin until the band takes three months off after finishing Rubber Soul: Tomorrow Never Knows (recorded April 6-7, 1966; includes Indian tamboura, a melody similar to an Indian raga drone that barely moves out of the key of C, lyrics borrowed from Timothy Leary, swirly vocals modified using a Leslie speaker cabinet, tape loops with unusual sounds at random intervals, drumming from Ringo that sounds like a tape loop but isn't)Love You To (recorded April 11, 1966; George's first song written in Indian raga style)Rain (recorded April 14, 16, 1966; included multiple overdubs recorded at slow speed and high speed to fatten up the sound and make the tempo slightly more draggy, includes drone-like textures)I'm Only Sleeping (recorded April 27-May 6, 1966; inspired by how John's LSD use encouraged his desire to be lazy, use of dreamlike imagery, backward guitar sounds)I Want to Tell You (recorded June 2-3, 1966; lurching and oscillating harmonies, lyrics focusing on internal confusion, sounds of a piano that sounds out of tune)She Said She Said (recorded June 21, 1966; \"fattened\" vocals similar to \"Rain,\" lyrics inspired by an encounter John Lennon had with Peter Fonda while taking an LSD trip, tapes of Ringo's drums may have been manipulated to sound choppier)Strawberry Fields Forever (recorded November 24 thru December 22, 1966; mellotron, George playing an Indian instrument called a svarmandal, two melodies in different keys combined into one song by playing them at slightly different speeds, introspective lyrics focused on self-doubt, insistence that \"nothing is real\")Penny Lane (recorded December 29, 1966 thru January 17, 1967; may have been Paul's first song reacting to LSD, lyrics mention poppies on a tray, use of harmonium and piccolo trumpet, focus on returning to childhood experience)Carnival of Light (recorded January 5, 1967; avant-garde free form piece still not yet released, possibly could be viewed as Paul's version of Revolution #9)A Day in the Life (recorded January 19, 1967 thru February 22, 1967; disorienting time-shifts between verses written by John and Paul, symphony orchestra crescendos chaotically until ended in a long, droning chord)Only A Northern Song (recorded February 13-20, 1967; ethereal organ, musical instruments speeded up, in-studio chatter)Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite (recorded February 17, 1967; features tape manipulation and swirly organ sounds to approximate the sound of being in the middle of a circus)Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds (recorded February 28, 1967 thru March 2, 1967; lyrics feature considerable color imagery, atmposhere shifts from slow and dreamy tempo on the verses to more uptempo on the chorus, ethereal vocals)Within You Without You (recorded March 15, 1967 thru April 4, 1967; inspired by both Indian music and philosophy, song rarely moves out of the key of C)Magical Mystery Tour (recorded April 25, 1967 thru May 3, 1967; partially inspired by the LSD-soaked tours of Ken Kesey and his \"magic bus\" in the mid-1960s, uses \"trip\" as a double entendre)Baby, You're A Rich Man (recorded May 11, 1967; not very psychedelic lyrically, but the clavioline keyboard gives the songs a very unusual texture)It's All Too Much (recorded May 25, 1967-June 2, 1967; distorted guitar, Hammond organ with lots of sustained drones, main melody rarely moves out of key of G)I Am the Walrus (recorded September 5 thru September 29, 1967; surrealistic lyrics, disorienting tempo changes between verses, nonsense chants, random radio noise from a BBC broadcast of King Lear)Blue Jay Way (recorded September 6 thru October 6, 1967; lyrics inspired by the disorientation of being lost in L.A., includes phasing and backward tapes, oscillates between C major and C diminished)The Inner Light (recorded January 12 thru February 8, 1968; Indian influence on melody, lyrics focus on how you can \"travel\" without leaving your house)Across the Universe (recorded February 4-8, 1968; the original version before it was modified by Phil Spector features floating Lennon vocals with droning noises and unusual wildlife sounds, a child's voice matching John's voice also appears in the mix)Listing the recording dates is instructive here, because some of these songs would not get released until the Yellow Submarine LP (It's Only A Northern Song, It's All Too Much) or the Let It Be LP (Across the Universe in its Phil Spector version), but were definitely made during the period when psychedelic drugs had the biggest effect on the Beatles creative output. After February 1968, the Beatles went to Rishikesh to commune with the Maharishi, where they were told not to bring any drugs along, because Trascendental Meditation was a more natural high. Although the Beatles probably did take some marijuana along to Rishikesh, their use of strong hallucinogens ended at that point, except for John, who used LSD a few more times after Rishikesh. ",
