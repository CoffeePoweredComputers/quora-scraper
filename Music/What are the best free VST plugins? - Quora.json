            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give my 2020 answer here. The best free ones are, in my opinion, plugins that are normally expensive but are on promo. Granted, that usually requires a purchase combined with dumb luck. I\u2019ve probably used and evaluated 100 fee plugins over the years. Most have fell out of favor to paid plugins. For the most part, free plugins are worse than stock. In any case, I still use everything here, aside from the Rooster. My favorite free plugins are as follows, with one positive bullet and one negative bullet. Instrumemts: KONTAKT 6 PLAYER (kontakt player) Really good for sampled sounds.Limited selection, and 3rd party plugins often require KompleteTAL Software (TAL noisemaker) Interesting soft-synth. If you like nasty sounds, you really can\u2019t find a better synth than this.Limited in scope and function. I don\u2019t use it often, but when I do, it\u2019s perfect.Effects, emulators, etc: Wider - Polyverse Music (wider) a great stereo imager that\u2019s used heavily in EDM music.good for vocals, but nothing else as far as I can tell.Free Downloads (rough rider) a great compressor that can really add heat and damage to your chain. Works well with adding grit, but also works awesome with smoothing vocals.wouldn\u2019t really work on drums or for any gluing, IMO.Leveling Tool - AdHd (adhd compressor) I think this is supposed to emulate the CLA-2, but not really sure. Adds a lot of warmth. Totally changed how I approach and evaluate compressors.Not as good as many paid compressors, though that ought to be a given (and it\u2019s not, unfortunately)AmpliTube Custom Shop (amplitude custom shop) Great entry into using this and similar virtual and amp sims, all high-quality.Very limited selection of gear.AAX/AU/VST Audio Plugins from Black Rooster Audio (black rooster cypress) An excellent orange head. I don\u2019t really know which one this is emulating, but probably a Crush.The virtual cab is horrible, so use whatever other cab sim you can find.CamelCrusher (Compressor, Distortion, Filter) \u2022 Audio Plugins for Free (camelcrusher - not sure if this download page actually works) Legendary for a reason. Awesome for adding heavy dynamics and compression.nothing bad can be said about this one.Vinyl Overview | The ultimate lo-fi weapon (izotope vinyl) The best vinyl warping tool you\u2019ll find anywhere.nothing bad can be saidHome of the Xfer Records VST Suite (xfer oot) once again, legendary for a reason. It\u2019s a great multiband dynamic OTT that compliments Ableton\u2019s amazing OTT.runs very hot and distorts easily, thus limited in scope.Valhalla Freq Echo: Freqency Shifter Plugin | Free Reverb Plugin (valhalla freq echo) It\u2019s a great echo plugin from a well-regarded plugin companyrelatively week and limited in use. It\u2019s more nice to have just in case, but not something I use often.Krush - Free Bitcrusher Plugin (krush) excellent effects tool, ranging from distortion to bit-breakingnothing bad can be said here.8-Bit Shaper, Free Bit Crusher plugin, Download 8-Bit Shaper plugin, Free Xfer Records vst plugins (8bit crusher) It\u2019s fun to play around with this. It\u2019s more subtle than outright damaging.if you\u2019re going for agressive 8bit manipulation, you\u2019ll probably prefer something else.",

            "answer_text": "Alright. Let me classify VSTs into 2 different types. Synths.Effects.Synths : T-Force Alpha Plus. : If you know very basic sound design, then you can easily create some awesome sound in T-Force. It also has some presets which can be used for Trance, electro-house or house music. Ample Sound Bass Guitar Lite II : One of the best virtual bass guitar I have ever used. Natural. Can modify the sound to some extent. Auto Buzz feature. Really Great plugin. Alter Ego : Best Free Vocal Synthesis VST. You can actually lyrics & change voices betweem male & female banks. Choirs, harmony, lead vocal can be created using this VST. Oatmeal : Wanna design sound? This is best. Custom wavetables, great effects, everything. This synth is really power packed. No idea about sound design? Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s has very great presets too. Bored using same color. This synth also has skins. Best of all. It\u2019s fucking free. Synth plugins that come with your DAW : Believe me. The synths that come with your DAW are very power full. Just you got to know how to use them. I use FL & Ableton. Harmor, Sytrus, GMS, Directwave (sampler) are really great. Do I really have to show how great Ableton\u2019s sampler is? Effects. OTT : My love. My life. My baby. OTT by Xfer is a free plugin. OTT means over the top compression. It is just great. You apply it on anything & tweak it a little bit. BOOM!!! You have a great sound.TDR Nova : One of the easiest EQ + multiband compressor I\u2019ve ever used. It has unique design & some good presets too. Ozone Imager : It\u2019s fucking beautiful. Just use it ones. It\u2019s great.Old School Verb : Great Quality reverb plugin. Imitates an analog reverb circuit. Tweak or use presets. Both are great. DC1A : Best & easy to use Vocal Compressor. It has just 2 knobs. But work it does is I think is best. ",
