            "answer_text": "Read All About It by Emeli Sande. I\u2019ve sang this song so many times for so many auditions, because I am a mezzo soprano as well. It\u2019s a low but not too low song, ballad, soft, and has the perfect notes to show off your singing skills. I will admit that the song is very difficult to sing live, so practice as soon as you can. Clarity by ZEDD Most people would say that this song is too high but it\u2019s actually perfect for our second sopranos. The only difficult thing about this song is the notes. It requires some stamina and a lot of practice. To me, it was easy to sing. I recommend singing a piano version instead of with the EDM beat drop. What About Us by P!nk This is a big yes. Perfect for your voice and the message and the beat is super powerful. Out of this entire list, I recommend this one the most. ",
