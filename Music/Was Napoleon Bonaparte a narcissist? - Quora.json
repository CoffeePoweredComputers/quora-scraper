            "answer_text": "That\u2019s difficult to say. He certainly had grandiose expectations of superior treatment of others, he required continual admiration of others, perceived himself as unique which on the battlefield he certainly was, he certainly required obedience, he could certainly be very demeaning, and above all he was very fixated on fantasies of power, which were already present when he was a young artillery officer. The environment he grew up in was also very conducive to foster narcissitic traits, seeing lots of manipulation from his peers, excessive admiration and unpredictable caregiving. He could however be empathic, but this was all on a cognitive level, keep in mind he was certainly a very intelligent man and excelled at math, but with a great deal of manipulation behind it, as do many politicians. The real trouble is that a lot of stuff written about him, both the good and the bad has a lot of propaganda in it. Looking at the stories surrounding him and looking at the things that can at least be verified in some way, if I were to guess either perhaps score high on a subclinical level or indeed be narcissistic. However nowhere near the level of say the likes of Trump or Goering for that matter, more along the line of say someone like MacArthur. ",
