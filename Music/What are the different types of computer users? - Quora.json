Hardcore power user/modders/PC master race: Heavy PC user that builds his own high end muscle systems. This guy is into CADD or 3D modelling, hard core MMO gaming and spends a great deal of extra money continuously upgrading his system to all top end components. This guy is also very familiar with finer points of tweeking, overclocking and using a lot of mods on his PCs for special effects, bonus performance and extra immersion in gaming. You know there is a power user in the house when the guy has a custom water cooled PC with an oversized power supply, two graphics cards and a trio of high quality monitors. This guy often loves to display his high end PC hardware under case lighting you can view through a case window. ",
