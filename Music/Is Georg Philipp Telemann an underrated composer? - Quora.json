            "answer_text": "We really enjoy the music of Telemann and do indeed think he is underrated today. He lived during the Baroque period and was incredibly popular during his lifetime, and was about as close to a rock star as someone could get back then. Virtually all of his contempories held Telemann in high esteem and even Bach and Handel were great admirers of GPT. Telemann was one of those guys that just doesn\u2019t seem like he could have actually existed. He was born in 1681 and started composing and learned to play multiple instruments at a very early age. Since his parents didn\u2019t approve of the kid wasting his life playing music, the precocious little Telemann simply taught himself. There are all kinds of stories about Telemann having Mozartian talent and being able to hear a complicated piece of music just once and then being able to play it perfectly. There is no doubt that Telemann was very accomplished on many musical instruments and that\u2019s one of the reasons his music is so varied and fun. He wasn\u2019t just writing conceptual music like the almost mathematical contrapuntal abstractions that J.S. Bach managed to pull out of somewhere. Telemann could actually play most of the instrumentals he composed for, so he wrote music that expressed and bought out the idiosyncratic characteristics of each instruments. Bach and Handel primarily wrote masterpieces that were dripping with genius. However\u2026 Although Telemann did indeed write some masterpieces, he also intentionally wrote for all levels of musicians, even beginners. Amazing lovely and creative pieces, but something a less accomplished musician could have fun with. And unfortunately some music historians judge Telemann on his simple music. Many Baroque composers were prolific, but Telemann took it to a whole different level. He started composing when he was very young and composed right up to his death at age 86. So there is a monstrous amount of music written by Telemann of various quality and styles. There is an old joke that claims there must be a Telemann factory somewhere in Germany still producing his music because more and more pieces by him keep being discovered. Telemann obviously took his time on some of his masterpieces, but he also was a showman and, like Mozart, loved to impress people with his musical virtuosity and adroitness. Telemann enjoyed handing out copies out his latest compositions at parties, and the legend goes that he would pick out a particularly attractive young lady and actually compose a piece of music for the instrument of her choice while she waited. One old tale even claims that Telemann was ambidextrous and on occasion would take a pen in each hand, and compose two different pieces of music, for two different instruments, at the same time. That might be a bit difficult to believe, but so are some of the anecdotal tales about what Mozart was capable of. The talents and abilities of men like Mozart, Bach, and Telemann were anything but ordinary. And\u2026.. When Telemann wasn\u2019t composing music, he somehow found the time to write dozens of books on various subjects, and learned to speak multiple foreign languages. So\u2026 Anyone that plays just about any musical instrument can find something very satisfying by Telemann that\u2019s a whole lot of fun to play. And it\u2019s a shame that this fascinating, unique, and very talented fellow isn\u2019t appreciated as much today as he was when he was alive. <3 <3  An old Telemann trio I found loitering around our house. It\u2019s a wonderful piece of music and when we played it, we would replace the harpsichord on the continuo part with a harp or couple harps. Or sometimes a lute and harp. You can really mess around with Baroque music because it leaves a whole lot of freedom for the performer. Photo of well used Telemann music by the well used Anna K. <3 <3 ",
