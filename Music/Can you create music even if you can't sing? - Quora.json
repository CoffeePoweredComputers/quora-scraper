            "answer_text": "Sure. Though it helps to sing, many people create music without being a singer. Having said that: everybody CAN sing. Not everyone might be a great lead vocalist, but we all can sing. So singing for yourself along with the piano or guitar is a great way to come up with good melodies. Listen to old jazz recordings and you'll recognize, how many instrumentalists actually sing along during a solo. They might not be great singers, but that's not what it's about. So create awesome music even if you don't sing. And rest assured that you are able to sing :). ",

            "answer_text": "I seem to remember being told that Beethoven was not much of a singer, even when he did have his hearing. Now imagine yourself producing the same quality of music without the ability to sing or even hear it if you could. Arguably, one of the greatest composers ever wrote much of his output while being deaf as a post. So the answer is yes, it is possible but takes talent and hard work \u2014 just the same for some who can sing. ",

It helps to have knowledge of music theory and certain instruements to make creating more formal music easier, but you don't have to follow the rules of music. Even in the modern day of auto tune, people who can't sing are able to sing. So literally anything is possible as music technology and creativity move forward. ",
