            "answer_text": "Not just no, but \u2018HELL NO!\u2019!! They interviewed Dr Dre (sic) & his partner Xxxx and they said their design goal was to simulate the sound of a Discotheque in your ears\u2014Thump, Thump, THUMP!!! Consequently they are BASS Heavy with little Mids and absolutely no Trible. To add insult to injury, BEATS are outrageously expensive and has one of the worst build quality Apple has ever sold in their stores\u2014a $69.00 Chinese Headphones that retails for $300.00!!! However, they do come in Fashionista White, BS Blue, Gag Me Green and other fashion colours that absolutely do not affect their sound Quality. This is guaranteed!!! Beats are to HeadPhones what the Hummer H2 is to electric cars\u2026 If you are into portable phones, a Klipsch or Bose OE2 ($159) slaved to a good outboard Headphone Amp/DAC like my Fiio E17 Alpin ($80.00) will get you in the AudioPhile \u2018ball park\u2019. Sorry, I Gotta Go!!! I just loaded up my PAX vape, put on my STAX LAMDA PRO EarSpeakers and I am about to que up \u2018Dark Side of the Moon\u2019by Pink Fred\u2026Tssshooosh!!!!

            "answer_text": "The Beats Audio headphones used to be a lot lower sound quality but have been improving since 2014 when Apple bought the Beats brand. Beats Audio is essentially just a subsidiary of Apple that can get away with selling a lower quality product. For the price band, you should be aware that you are buying the headphones because you love the style and the Beats Audio/ Dr Dre brand rather than because you\u2019re looking for high-fidelity audio. In a sense, you\u2019re indirectly supporting Dr Dre (who\u2019s probably a millionaire anyway) which is great if you\u2019re a fan. I mean, he isn\u2019t a bad producer to be fair. In my subjective opinion of course. The headphones aren\u2019t too terrible as far as consumer headphones go, but they\u2019re not for the discerning audio aficionado. I have an article about Beats headphones if you would like a little more detail: Are Beats Headphones Any Good? ",

            "answer_text": "Good quality? That depends on what you are looking for? Studio quality? yes they sound good but they do not have a flat response\u2026. They have a boost in the low end (Bass) and for this reason a lot of people wear them because they like the bass to be loud. But if you are looking for a flat response (actual real representation of the music) then no this would be a bad choice because they do enhance the low end. It depends what you want to use them for, just enjoying music or Music Production\u2026 many headphones and speakers give you different frequency response, like the term Hi-Fi for high fidelity\u2026 your best bet if looking to just enjoy music would be to go to a Best Buy or similar store and try on a few pairs to see what sound you like the best.

            "answer_text": "Never had a pair or heard them but safe to say you are paying for celebrities to wear them. They get celebrities to sponsor them and in return they get them for free, all the add campaigns that follow costs money. They recover that cost by selling them at inflated prices and the public pay it because if Justin Bieber or Nicole Sherzinger or whoever is out wearing them then fans will want them because they must good right? Audiophiles will tell you you can buy far better ones for a 3rd of the price. A big give away is unlike a pair of Beyerdynamic or Siennieser, with Beats there is no documentation with detailed specs about frequency response, or frequency range, +- THD ect. Just an expensive looking gift box. ",

            "answer_text": "No. They are fine, although overpriced, for listening to low quality MP3 music, however there are many much better headphones which perform way better than Beats. I suggest that you visit a shop like Guitar Center and listen to a whole array of different bands. Bring samples of music you know. Note: in the past decade or so, many new releases of digital music heavy bass has been added because marketing research tends to show that \u201cnew listeners\u201d prefer a heavy beat. It has been noted that many young people purchases are based upon \u201cstyle\u201d over function and at usually a higher cost. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. The quality is not bad. But the problem is the price. Just like Apple (Beats are actually a subsidiary of Apple), if you buy it, you just paid for the brand, not quality. I don't really recommend you to buy Beats. You should buy a better brand like Sony or JBL. Yes, Beats were good until it got bought by Apple. For the price, I still recommend you to buy other brand. ",

For me they have way too much low-end, I prefer a more neutral sounding HP with much detail but this is my taste\u2026 ",
