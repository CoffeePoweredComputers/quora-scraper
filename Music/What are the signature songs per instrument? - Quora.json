            "answer_text": "First of all, it is incredibly hard to choose a song that defines one instrument, especially considering the number of different genres and styles that may include the same instrument. Secondly, many may think that metal is the guitar's genre, or classical is the violin's genre and so on, but I will choose a song that is the most multifaceted showcase of the instrument.Lastly, my choices will be based on my view of the instrument, which may or may not correlate with other's. I will do my best to explain down the road. Please note, that I choose many obscure artists. The reason for this is to show people something new that they probably don't know, but hopefully will like. It is also to show you, that there are some hidden, obscure gems in every genre that are worth digging into the genre for. Therefore, many of these songs are the gems I have digged up in my search for the \"perfect song\".  Guitar: Ahh, the guitar... The instrument I like the best when handled skillfully and with grace, and the instrument I distaste the most when it is handled wrongfully. I really love when an artist manages to create an emotional atmosphere, using both acoustic and electric guitars and makes it flow soothingly. Sorry for the long song, but it is perfection, in my opinion. How the soothing, hypnotic melody of the electric guitars envelop the careful acoustic guitar, and slowly the electric guitar takes over as a crushing wave of emotion overwhelms you... Listen, and sorry for the tears if they drop.   Buckethead - Padmasana Piano: The piano is the perfect instrument to transcend all kind of emotions. I do, however, most like this instrument when the music is carefully arranged, and with great emotional depth. The most important thing is, that it must make us feel, and reflect upon what we feel when listening carefully. My choice here may be common, but here I can agree with the majority that is an apt choice.   Lucovico Einaudi - Nuvole Bianche Other keyboard:Here I assume that synthesizers are included, as long as they are not used to emulate other instruments.I have a lot of curiosity in the wonders and vistas of space, and I'd like to think that aliens like us exist out there, thinking like us whether or not there may be other life out there. You may be thinking \"Hey Allan, we are talking music here, not alien stuff\", I say well, the synthesizer is the most versatile instrument ever made, and therefore it can be used to paint a picture of whatever idea we may have.The song I have chosen makes me think of space, in a beautiful, wonderful and lustrous way. The first 2 minutes and 45 seconds is digital synthesizers used in an aweinducing way.   Nychts - (small part of) Zwischen Leere und Nichts Drums:I see drums as a way for us to release our primal instincts of releasing our anger and frustration onto something in a non-harmful way. Also the ancient tradition of dancing, partying and generally having a great, wild time gains a lot from drumming.  It seems we have to go back in time, and imagine old African tribes dancing, playing on their djembes, singing and having fun!    Vocals:Empathy is a human trait which most of us possesses. Some would even go as far as saying, that this trait is what make us human. No instrument should be able to trigger our empathy as much as our voice. After all, our voice is that we use to tell other people of our memories, our happiness, our sorrows. What I have found, is that the best vocalists are able to make us feel empathetic towards the singer, even without us understanding a word of what he or she sings. Lisa Gerrard is definitely one of the finest at touching our emotions with her mere voice.    WIldcard - CelloI have always had a love for the cello's warm and soothing timbre. In my opinion, however, most artists do not use it for the sound, setting nor the speed I would like to hear. I have always wanted to hear it played with long, sweeping sounds and a distinct scandinavian tone. The search was long, and I ended up finding the piece listening to black metal (!!!). Anja Lillem\u00e6hlum (pronounced Lillemeghluhm) was hired to play the last bit of a long song that tries to convey the story of the murders on old Danish kings, and how the people of Denmark stood together in the bloody times.  Note that this part of the songs is pure cello, with a backgroud synth. No earbleeding black metal ;-)    Angantyr - Blod for Blod, Liv for Liv I am sorry for omitting some of the instruments you asked for, I have unfortunately not yet looked much into the genres incorporating the omitted instruments. I hope these songs are to your liking. Maybe you will even find them inspirational in ways. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh geez.  I can't possibly write an answer that everyone will agree with (thanks for putting my on the spot, Mike).  I'll try my best, in the spirit of being a good sport. 1.  Guitar.  Lots of types of guitar styles ranging from acoustic, to blues, to classical to heavy metal.  I'll just pick acoustic.  Classical Gas, made famous by Mason Williams, is the first that comes to mind.  It's probably the one of the first songs I learned to play on the guitar.  Even though this piece is far too difficult for a beginner, that didn't stop me from trying.  I've played this on the piano, but really, this is a guitar only song.  I'll offer the Tommy Emmanuel rendition, so you can appreciate the instrument without all the brass in the original release.   2.  Piano.  Although I play the piano, I'm struggling with this one.  Like the guitar, the piano is a versatile instrument and sounds good with virtually every type of musical genre.   My 'you've forced me into a corner answer' for piano is La campanella, composed by Franz Listz.  You cannot play this piece on a harmonica.   3. Other keyboard.  Lots of choices here.  Organ, harpsichord, clavichord and digital piano are the ones most people are familiar with (or at least, have heard of).  Lots of great pop songs sound really good on a digital piano.  Not sure if this piece 'defines' the instrument, but I'll go with Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody.   4. Bass.  I Want You Back by the Jackson 5.  Here is a bass only version of the song.  I have to say, it's not quite as impressive without the singing and other instrumentation.   With all the other goodies.  5. Drums.  In the Air Tonight (sung by Phil Collins)  6.  Vocals.  I think Whitney Houston had one of the best voices.  Probably her most famous song was The Greatest Love of All (sorry, George Benson, her version was much better).  This answer may have been influenced by the fact that I'm learning to play this song right now on the piano.   7. Brass.  September, Earth, Wind and Fire.  The song would not be the same without all that great brass.   8. Woodwinds.  This category is a bit too broad, as there are about 100 different woodwind instruments (according to Wikipedia), some I've never even heard of.  Just for the sake of conversation, I'll pick the saxophone, which I think is a cool instrument.  I don't have much experience with the sax, so this choice is probably not the best one.  I present Urgent by Foreigner.   9.  DJ/Beat.  I'm not sure what that even means.  I'll pass on that one. 10. Wildcard.  My choice?  Let's try one off the beaten path.  How about the pan flute?  I heard this song in the movie Kill Bill Vol. 1 and fell in love with this haunting song (and instrument).   Here is The Lonely Shepard (performed by Gheorghe Zamfir).   Hope you enjoyed some of selections. ",
