            "answer_text": "Here are some of the basic reasons as to why Lisa gained popularity outside of South Korea: 1.) Visuals Natural or not (it doesn\u2019t really matter) Lisa\u2019s visuals absolutely stands out. Her big eyes and plump lips is probably the biggest factor as to why people notice her. She also resembles a barbie doll, especially during the time where she was blonde. Her hair color at that time complimented her doll-like features, not to mentiom her side profile. She can also pull off a lot of outfits because of her prominent shoulder blades, and long limbs. In conclusion, people get curious because she looks unbelievable (only non-biased kpop stans or non-kpop fans would agree). 2.) Personality This is arguably the main factor as to why people are obsessed with her. They find her amusing and one of a kind with her energetic and bubbly personality (which can be seen in all of BLACKPINK\u2019s reality shows). She\u2019s just a happy virus that makes any pairing in BLACKPINK interesting. She and Jisoo brings the laughter and entertainment in the group most of the time. 3.) Talent She\u2019s the main dancer of the group but she can rap in Korean and English really well (to the point that their main producer, named Teddy, have given her more rap parts than the main rapper of the group, but don\u2019t be mistaken Jennie\u2019s a powerful rapper and can also sing really well). She has also acknowledgeable vocals for an idol who\u2019s fort\u00e9 is dancing (reminds me of Ten from NCT, guy\u2019s also an amazing vocalist). Her dance performances have went viral multiple times. And it\u2019s not because of the choreo, it\u2019s more centralized around her looks and her dancing skills. 4.) A Member of BLACKPINK BLACKPINK are one of those groups that are oozing with charisma. Their live performances is considered as one of the best in the KPOP industry. Their charisma is basically rooted from their fashion, music and the members itself. Lisa, as a member of the group, becomes more interesting because of the clique she\u2019s included in. There\u2019s no harm in admitting that because the group can be known through the member or vice versa. I mean it works both ways. ",

            "answer_text": "When I say LISA is POPULAR I really mean it. Lisa can actually have her solo career and still be successful. She can pursue being an idol in South Korea or start another career in her home country Thailand and still get loads of love from the Blink or from her fans club. One of the reasons I think why she is so popular is that because she is super talented. The LISA being a MAIN DANCER in Blackpink can show more than what she can do in the group. She is not called a dancing machine for no reason. I considered Lisa as of the best dancer in the Kpop industry today. Moreover, I think it is also because she is good in rapping. I mean, yes, there a lot of girl idols that can rap well but I think Lisa is somewhat different from them. Imagine not being born a Korean or even have a korean blood but you can RAP in KOREAN which most of the Koreans I think find difficult to do\u2026. Well this connects to the third reason why she is popular, I think most of the people see Lisa as an inspiration. Lisa left her country and her family at a young age and went to a country that is new to her. Imagine not being able to express how you feel because you cannot talk to people around you, have to deal with completely different culture far from what she is used to and endure the pain of not seeing her family. But Lisa proved that she can achieve her dream. She was able to debut and now she is the LISA people love and support. I can say more but I have something to do,,,,,,, anyway STAN LISA MANOBAN! STAN BLACKPINK! ",
