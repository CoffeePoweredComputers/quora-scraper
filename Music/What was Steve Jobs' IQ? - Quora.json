            "answer_text": "Steve Jobs earned a 32 on the ACT at a time when a 24 is now equivalent to a 28. According to Mensa, a 29[1] at that time is still a qualifying score for membership so we can assume that\u2019s in the neighborhood of 98th percentile. To earn a 32, I\u2019d guess would be in the neighborhood of a 35 today, which is in the 99.6th percentile today[2]. The correlations between standardized tests and IQ were much higher than they were today. The *recently* old SAT had a correlation as high as .86[3]. Going by a conservative r of .82 from old ACT to IQ and a 99.5th percentile score we find: [math](0.82)*(.995i \u2192 2.576 SD) = 2.112 SD =[/math] 132 [WAIS/WISC]151 [Cattel]134 [Stanford-Binet]A little bit a pseudo-data, but that\u2019s a good lower bound for his IQ. Personally, I\u2019d put him in the 140 - 150 [WAIS] range due to his financial success. There is a correlation between the two, but I think this gives you a good estimate already. Feel free to upvote and I\u2019ll perform that calculation. EDIT: Due to the surprising number of upvotes, this is a breakdown of Steve Jobs\u2019s IQ as predicted from financial success. At beginning of the year of his death, Steve Jobs was worth $8.3 Billion[4] \u201ctying\u201d him as the 110th richest person alive. The world population turned 7 billion at the end of the same year.[5] With that kind of rarity we find: [math]110/7,000,000,000 \u2248 0.99999998428i \u2192 5.6535 SD[/math] Yes, \u201cwow\u201d We have two choices for r: A senior published meta-analysis[6]Two recent unpublished meta-analyses[7] [8]The first finds: [math](0.23)*(5.6535 SD) \u2248 1.3 SD[/math] 121 [WAIS/WISC]132 [Cattel]120 [Stanford-Binet]The second two (.49 & .48) find: [math](0.485)*(5.6535 SD) \u2248 2.74 SD[/math] 141 [WAIS/WISC]166 [Cattel]144 [Stanford-Binet]At these top tiers of net worth, the income is proportional to wealth. We have few kings hoarding their piles of treasure, sinking out of existence. Old Warren Buffett is as competitive as ever. Even the Arabian oil barons experience mildly-meritocratic intelligence selection: they continue to invest and expand into renewable technologies, etc. Obviously, the ratio isn\u2019t solid; so take note of that. Steve Jobs was undoubtedly genius. Pristine intelligence is necessary to achieve innovation and success on a world scale. But\u2026 I think to myself of all the times Steve dropped acid, all of his adventures in India, the luck of his birth in The Valley, his astute emotional clairvoyance, and his dedication to merit. These are what made Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs. EDIT: grammar Footnotes[1] Qualifying test scores[2] How Many People Get a 34, 35, 36 on the ACT?

            "answer_text": "Steve Jobs had an IQ of about 160+ (range: 150 to 178):  Steve Jobs likely had an IQ roughly 160 or above. In Walter Isaacson's biography,  near the end of 4th grade Jobs was tested. Jobs said: 'I scored at the  high school sophomore level.' This means he was a 4th grader performing  at the 10th grade level. The average 4th grader is 9 or 10 years old and  the average 10th grader is 15 or 16 years old. Using the standard mental age/chronological age x 100 = IQ formula,  we can create rough boundaries. Lower bound: 15/10 x 100 = 150 IQ.  Upper bound: 16/9 x 100 = 178 IQ. Average of the bounds is 164 IQ. Of  course, if Jobs was a young 4th grader then his IQ would be even higher.  Steve Jobs clearly had exceptional intelligence, regardless of what his  exact IQ score was. This makes sense, considering that Bill Gates, the other wunderkind, said 'Software is an IQ business.'
