            "answer_text": "I have no knowledge of Halseys background, nor do I care what so ever. I only listened to Boy with Luv because I love BTS. However based on what I heard. I think she made the song a lot worse. I mean I heard both versions (In case you didnt know, theres an album ver. and a mv. ver, both have different amount of Halsey parts) and I think the song would\u2019ve been much better with ONLY BTS. Also.. The \u201cI WANT IT\u201d line makes me cringe so hard. and her \u201cOh MYMYMY\u201d just doesn't sound as good as how Jungkook sang it Overall I\u2019d MUCH MUCH rather listen to the version where Jungkook and V replace Halseys lines. Her voice was just so unappealing in this song and she sounded like an annoying little girl. ",
