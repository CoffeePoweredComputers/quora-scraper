            "answer_text": "I think the a good start on learning more about rhythm is to demystify it a little. Rhythm is something that scares a lot of musicians on every level, whether your rhythm is accurate, whether you can understand a rhythm that is more complex than your current level, etcetera. Thing is, when you first start to learn about rhythm, most of us just count; 1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4. Rhythm, in a sense is really just counting. There\u2019s two parts . There\u2019s the pulse\u2026. that\u2019s the 1 2 3 4\u2026 wherever you foot naturally ends up tapping\u2026 then there is what happens within the pulse - the notes . That is the rhythm. Of course sometimes the pulse might be difference. So in the most common scenario , the pulse will be 4/4 means 4 quarter (1/4) notes\u2026. it means 4/4 contains 8 eighth (1/8) notes, or 16 sixteenth notes. It sounds complicated, but it\u2019s still just counting. Except now you might have to go up to a higher number. No matter what your level, one of the best ways to learn rhythm is to hear a rhythm, and copy it. Once you have chosen the rhythm you will copy, and you managed to repeat it, then you can try to understand what it is! By counting. Find if the rhythm has notes that land on each beat of the pulse, or before, or after! ",

For a percussionist like Evelyn Glennie, she is constantly refining and honing her skills by investigating  and incorporating certain complex improvisatory elements found in ethnic cultures. The rhythms of some contemporary classical composers are clearly the product of paperwork alone, and then left to the performer to approximate as best he can. Such an example might well be this of Brian Ferneyhough:  Here is the actual rendering of this passage:Brian Ferneyhough - String Quartet No 6  You ask me, How best to learn rhythm? From the outset I learnt it, as did most musicians, not in isolation from, but in conjunction with  melody, and later harmony and counterpoint. Moreover, so did Brian Ferneyhough, long before he ever ventured into the territory outlined above.  ",
