Whenever I\u2019m sad or distressed I think about Jerry and what he would say and I instantly feel better!! If I could meet him I would say the he changed my outlook on life and that I aspire to be like him! I would say that thanks to him am a better person and that I will always be thankful! Jerry is one of the best human being on this world to ever exist! Just seeing him brightens my day! And Monica was right, hearing is laugh does make you instantly smile!! Jerry i love you (platonically!) Sorry even you can\u2019t make me straight!!  ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean my kpop bias? Do you mean someone I idolize thats not in kpop? My kpop bias is Wonho formerly of MonstaX. When I was watching No Mercy his determination was obvious as was his cockiness. As it got closer to the end you could see desperation slowly easing up on him. It was just very real. He wasn't the best son to his parents and he knew that was the way to fix it. From then to now he has allowed Wonho to soothe Lee Hoseok (his real name). Wonho (stage name) gives love fearlessly and recieves it and it has allowed Lee Hoseok to grow. If I met him I would call him Mr. Lee because I would want to speak to him not Wonho. I'd thank him for the music that has gotten me through some rough times. Thank him for standing up and doing what he felt right with HSH issue and ask that he thank his brothers for the best memory of my life. For my daughter's high school graduation I took her to see MonstaX. My memories of her laugh and smile to the beat of their music fill me with happiness. Much more than I deserve. I'd shake his hand and leave. Outside of kpop my idol is Batman. I am in love with Bruce Wayne since elementary school. If I met him I'd just pass the f*k out. ",
