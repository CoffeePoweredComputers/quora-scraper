            "answer_text": "Everyone now uses auto tune or some other brand of the same thing. If used as designed to be used you don\u2019t know it\u2019s even there. It\u2019s supposed to do exactly how it sounds, by using the rhythm track it corrects the pitch on vocals for the scale of the key they\u2019re in. It\u2019s supposed to be completely transparent. It\u2019s being used as an effect by setting it out of the parameters for intended use and using out of tune vocals. Anyone who\u2019s using it where you can hear it do the corrections is basically using it the same as you would use Reverb or Chorus, just as a effect on the vocal track. The first time I remember hearing it used this way was on a recording Cher had released and if I remember right it was just on the chorus of the song. I thought it was a interesting idea on that song but it\u2019s been way over used, it was good for a novelty in my opinion but not for a standard effect. I still like Studder 2\u201d tape 24 track reel to reels and analog and tube equipment, you have to be able to stay in tune and in time since you can\u2019t correct pitch or timing but it\u2019s such a organic, real sound. I love the warmth and depth of those types of studios. ",

            "answer_text": "Look at it from this perspective: Auto-Tune was used first on \u201cBelieve\u201d by Cher in 1998. It was her first(and last) number one Billboard Hot 100 single in 24 years. It is also the first time an \u201cinstrument\u201d topped the Hot 100 the first time it was used. Cher's First U.S. number one was released the same Year The Beatles released their first Billboard Hot 100 single. The span of time between number ones broke a record set by George Harrison 10 years prior. It beat a record set by one of The Freakin Beatles for God\u2019s sake. What other reason does one actually need? ",
