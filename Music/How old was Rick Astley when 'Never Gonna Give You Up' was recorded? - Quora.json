Yes he was very young at the time. I have to give the man credit. Rick rolling became a thing placing his song in unusual spots where you would never expect it. I think it\u2019s great he has been able to laugh at himself. He joined the Foo Fighters on stage for a performance of the song. As you can see, the crowd knew the words.  ",
