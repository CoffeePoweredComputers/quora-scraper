            "answer_text": "Why does my neighbor have a Confederate flag on his flagpole? There are four possible (and sometimes related) reasons I can think of: Pride in the region that they (or their family) is from: Despite its baggage (for some, because of its baggage), and despite there being many, better things to celebrate about the region, the traitors\u2019 flag has also become a symbol of the South. With the relatively high levels of geographic mobility in the US, many people in one part of the country are from (or have parents or grandparents from) another region.Class identification/romanticism: That flag has come to identify the white, rural working class \u2014 especially (but not exclusively) from the South. There\u2019s a significant overlap here with country music, whose target demographic also identifies with or romanticizes the white, rural working class. It\u2019s no coincidence that said flag is referenced in country music, again despite (or because of) its baggage.Anti-government feeling: The primary user of the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia (square) or Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee/Confederate Naval Jack (rectangular) prior to the 1960s was the Ku Klux Klan (who adopted it as a symbolic claim of descent from said illegal militias). Use became more widespread in the 1950s and \u201960s by segregationists, whose symbolic message was, \u201cI\u2019m willing to commit treason to keep Black folks down, just like my ancestors were.\u201d In the same way that its use has spread as an identifier of class and regional identity, use has also spread as a symbol of rejection of what the users claim to be federal government overreach (sometimes a rejection of the federal \u2014 or all \u2014 government in its entirety).Racism: Not all racists use this flag as a symbol of their racial politics, and many who use this flag for reasons (like the first two, above) that they separate from their politics (in their own minds, at least). But a complete answer to this question can\u2019t avoid the fact this was the battle flag/naval jack of three illegal militias committing treason in order to maintain slavery and it was revived by those who opposed racial integration, and some of those who display it do so because of the racial politics that it symbolizes.Many of those who see this flag will jump to the fourth reason first, even when it\u2019s not the case for the particular user. Such is the baggage of said flag, and why I advocate for the use of symbols of the South that do not celebrate treason for slavery. Is it okay? No. It's legal, bit not okay. It is an emblem of support for treason in defense of slavery, and later a threat of treason in defense of segregation. If you don\u2019t recognize that, you\u2019re being willfully blind to the meaning of the \u201cConfederate flag\u201d (typically the Confederate Naval Jack/Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee; less frequently the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia; only very rarely any one of the three pseudo-national flags of the Confederate States of America). A little bit of history:The flag generally recognized and displayed as the \u201cConfederate flag\u201d was the Confederate Naval Jack and the battle flag of the Army of Tennessee (in its rectangular form), and the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia (in its square form). It was used by these illegal militias to identify themselves during their treason. \"If any person or persons, owing allegiance to the United States of America, shall levy war against them, or shall adhere to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States, or elsewhere, and shall be thereof convicted on confession in open Court, or on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act of the treason whereof he or they shall stand indicted, such person or persons shall be adjudged guilty of treason against the United States, and SHALL SUFFER DEATH\u201d 1790 US Treason Law Treason Against the United States. Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. US Constitution Article III Section 3 This treason was most definitely in defense of slavery: \u201cBut an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.\u201d \u2014 South Carolina Declaration of Secession \u201cOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery - the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product, which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.\u201d\u201cIt has grown until it denies the right of property in slaves, and refuses protection to that right on the high seas, in the Territories, and wherever the government of the United States had jurisdiction.It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion.It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union, and has utterly broken the compact, which our fathers pledged their faith to maintain.It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst.It has enlisted its press, its pulpit and its schools against us, until the whole popular mind of the North is excited and inflamed with prejudice.It has made combinations and formed associations to carry out its schemes of emancipation in the States and wherever else slavery exists.\u201d \u2014 Mississippi Declaration of Secession \u201cFor the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slaveholding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.\u201d (followed by a synopsis of the history of the abolition movement in the United States) \u2014 Georgia Declaration of Secession \u201cShe was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them?The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States.\u201d\u201cIn all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States.\u201d\u201cThey have for years past encouraged and sustained lawless organizations to steal our slaves and prevent their recapture, and have repeatedly murdered Southern citizens while lawfully seeking their rendition.\u201d\u201cAnd, finally, by the combined sectional vote of the seventeen non-slave-holding States, they have elected as president and vice-president of the whole confederacy two men whose chief claims to such high positions are their approval of these long continued wrongs, and their pledges to continue them to the final consummation of these schemes for the ruin of the slave-holding States.\u201d \u2014 The Declaration of Causes of Seceding States(Texas) The \u201cConfederate flag\u201d was then rarely used for nearly 100 years, except by the Ku Klux Klan, which used it in an attempt to claim descent from the original users of the flag. How the Confederate Battle Flag was Allowed to Become a Symbol of Racism - This Cruel War That flag came into common use in the South (and display by certain states on their state property and in their flags) in response to the Civil Rights movement, implying willingness to try to secced again. Modern display of the Confederate flag - Wikipedia Many people turn their faces away and try to pretend that that flag represents some vague \u2018Southern heritage\u2019 without the baggage of that heritage: segregation, slavery, and treason. I think that Southerners have much more to be proud of, and should celebrate that instead. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to know why your neighbor is flying a flag, you should ask your neighbor. Is it against the law to fly a flag of a country that does not exist? Would you be more comfortable if your neighbor flew a Rainbow flag? Flags are symbolic. And consequently, there is an etiquette for flying them. Ifyour neighbor flew the state flag of Florida under a U.S. flag, that would follow etiqutee (I mention the Florida flag because it is similar to the Confederate flag). If your neighbor flew the Florida flag above the U.S. flag that would be contrary to etiquette. That is, it would not be \u201cokay\u201d. Likely, your neighbor flies that flag to indicate something he believes in, or at least wants to advertise. If you are friendly with your neighbor, you might ask why. If your neighbor is belligerent or inclined to be rude and/or violent, best just leave it alone as he may be deliberately doing it to be provocative and is wanting attention and perhaps a fight. Don\u2019t give it to him. ",
