            "answer_text": "We most likely will never know. I will take a stab, as I think there were probably a variety of reasons John was so angry -At the time, John was depressed and anxious. He began to tire of fame and all the stress that went with it. Roger Taylor said he was going through personal issues when he tossed his bass. -By the mid 1980s, John\u2019s relationship with his wife became strained and he stopped wearing his wedding ring (he still doesn\u2019t wear it to this day). There were talks of divorce and they may of formally separated. I\u2019ve also heard of affairs, but the only evidence I have are some dubious Italian tabloids. -John had one of his bass guitars spray painted black. -John began to drink heavily. He kept a fully stocked mini bar backstage and would end every show drunk. He would get black out drunk at parties and began to look quite unkempt during the Magic tour. -He has been reported to have abused drugs, mainly downers and antidepressants. -He was said to have had a mental breakdown and disappeared for days. Even his poor wife didn\u2019t know were he was. The story goes she went so far as to approach Freddie Mercury himself with her concerns. -Earlier in the tour, he had a serious fight with Freddie Mercury that left their dressing room destroyed before a show in Madrid. Freddie and John always had a good relationship with a good amount of mutual respect. - The night before, an audience member was stabbed to death during the Queen concert. -His roadie, Ratty wrote that there was a dark vibe that night, and his two charges were not there usual selves. John was sullen, and Freddie was fatigued and lacked his usual energy. -Finally, did John know Freddie was ill? I don\u2019t know how much the average layman knew about the symptoms and causes of HIV/AIDS. I do think that it\u2019s significant that he actually approached Jim Hutton in private to address early Kaposi Sarcoma marks on Freddie\u2019 calf. Since John was so quiet, it probably meant something he would ask Jim about such a sensitive matter. John was very intelligent and good at using logic to solve problems. Maybe he was able to notice changes and put two and two together. Basically, John Deacon was mad at the world when he tossed the bass, and snapped out of it, apologizing to his roadie. John shared his shock with Ratty and even seeing a bit scared. This is all speculation on my part. I can very well be wrong. John Deacon is so obscure, that I cannot help but become curious. ",

            "answer_text": "John Deacon always has a depression problem. Word is, he was having major emotional, and family problems at home. The over the top craziness of the last concert in their long tour, and his going\u2019s on in his personal life just caught up with him. Emotions riding high at the end of the concert, mixed with depression and everything else just built up, and he threw his guitar. At least he was on top of it enough, not to throw it towards the audience or the other band members. I\u2019m sure Freddie helped him to calm down and relax a bit back stage. That\u2019s just the kind of person Freddie was. He would know better, that if John acted out aggressively like that, that there was an underlying issue. John was generally a very quiet, calm man. Unfortunately, the camera caught it. So of course the press would jump on it. Love You Freddie\u2026Always\u2665\ufe0f ",
