            "answer_text": "Biased too and I know it. That\u2019s why I have been trying lately to find some objective reasons, why 80\u2019s music was so remarkable. And I think I\u2019ve found one very strong argument. It is the diversity of it. Quick look at Billboard Top 100 chart of the time shows it very clearly. Let\u2019s take 88, as the diversity in the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s is even more prominent. Music: Top 100 Songs | Billboard Hot 100 Chart It has all kinds of styles in it. Basically, something for everyone. R&B, Soul, Hardrock, Reggae, Hip Hop, Blues. I think at some point even Willie Nelson was in the charts. I guess Country was still strong back then ;) Today\u2019s Billboard Top 100 chart is a list of barely recognizable songs with some touches of R&B and soul. Almost every song has a hip hop or some kind of rap element in it. Most of them use the same synths and effects (auto tune included). It\u2019s a really hard to find a memorable melody. In addition they are not that different rhythmically as well. We see a lot of collaborations between artists. I am not saying that there are no different styles any more. Just saying that they are not that popular and somehow they don\u2019t find a place in the popular charts. So there you have it. First argument is just plain old statistics. The more styles you have, the more people can associate with the music, the bigger the chance that they like it. It gets a little more difficult, if you are looking for musical arguments for why 80\u2019s music is so loved, because not everyone is capable or willing to see the quality aspects of it. In my opinion, there are some strong objective arguments there too. They have a lot to do with how music developed in the 20th century, I think. Not so long ago I stumbled upon this picture:  You see how all sorts of styles spawned after jazz waned in the sixties. And it is not because \u201cconventional\u201d jazz stopped existing for some reasons. It was overtaken by other styles that incorporated harmonies and rhythms from jazz and blues while doing the music more lighter and more listenable to a lot more people. Rock/Hardrock stepped on blues offering strong and memorable melodies and simple loud rhythms, while R&B, Soul and Funk concentrated on subtle dreamy jazz chord progressions and dancing rhythms. Strangely enough, there was also a mix of the two - Funkadelic/Parliament for example, who are a almost like a religion. Jazz fusion kind of continued the art form of jazz taking the abstract to extremes. Pink Floyd with their suites and conceptual albums is one example. John McLaughlin is another example of prominent fusion artist. There are a lot more. You also have the progressive rock bunch - Colosseum, Mike Oldfield, Queen (perhaps most popular), David Bowie etc. Finally we are getting to the 80\u2019s, where we are in an already extremely saturated musical environment. With so much great musicians before them (a lot of them still active), the artists of the 80\u2019s had a very tough job - to compete with the titans musically and to offer lighter music to the public, as people were more or less tired of fighting the system during the 60\u2019s. They had to remain strong in terms of compositions and rhythms while being entertaining and recognizable in order for them to compete with their peers. That is how Queen evolved into something more popular, for example (I really don\u2019t like the result that much, by the way. I wanted them to remain progressive rock band ;). Another very interesting example - ABBA. Intricate compositions and chord progressions incorporating techniques from all other styles (even barock classical music) and simple memorable melodies with strong vocals. Also, Toto managed to make progressive rock that was more melodic, while remaining pretty complicated in their musical forms (phrases, song structures etc.). Last but not least - Duran Duran. I hated them. LOL. But from the distance of time, I can appreciate what quality arrangements they\u2019ve produced. Now turn to the jazz/funk corner. Prince took blues and jazz to its most pure popular form. He was a brilliant composer and a great entertainer. Same goes for Michael Jackson. Same stylistic roots for both of them but such different products. Dance was also a big part of 80\u2019s music. Hip-hop and rap music used the basis of funk and R&B and topped them with strong lyrics. Finally we should also consider the voices. Singing was a huge thing during the 80\u2019s. Nowadays popular music has the voices of Adele and Lady Gaga in the charts, and sadly we\u2019ve lost Amy Winehouse. Back then we had Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, George Michael, Annie Lennox, Freddie Mercury, Axl Rose, Diana Ross, Lisa Stansfield, David Coverdale and the list goes on. The advantage of singing is that it appeals to everyone - old and young. Themes of the lyrics were also more universal and to some extent more leisurely. Most of them were about love. But there were also some pretty political and socially engaging. Those styles of music that peaked during the 80\u2019s didn\u2019t stop existing in 1990. They reached deep into the middle 90\u2019s. And also more of them appeared in the early 90\u2019s that were at least as good if not better musically. Think about Nirvana and Soundgarden- simple power chords, emotional aggressive vocals. Because there was no interruption between the 80\u2019s and the 90\u2019s people tend to think about the 80\u2019s as something that lasted for ages. And as to why popular music today is not that diverse as it was, here\u2019s the answer of Boy George  ",

            "answer_text": "Before I begin, I will say that while these conclusions are my own, the below youtube video helped me to flesh out my reasonings. Please don\u2019t be dissuaded by the catchy preview picture though, it\u2019s not a bash fest against \u201cmillenials\u201d or anything of that sort. Its long and veering towards a tangent, so there\u2019s a TLDR at the end.  I\u2019ve come to perceive popular music these days as more of a self-fulfilling mathematical equation in it\u2019s expression, and less of an art form in and of itself. It feels dead to me, at least when regarding music on the radio, tv, movies\u2026 and big named artists. I believe this is partly due to artistic talent, the internet, the extreme saturation of musical genres, and the way in which those genres are engineered to sell. With the internet and advent of social media, you can post something online and everyone has instant access. If their friend tells another friend to check out a certain video, it gets more views, and is recognized to be popular. In the pre-internet days, artists had to hone their art to a higher degree to remain competitive. Now that isn\u2019t meant to insinuate that there is a drastic talent gap between artists of different eras, as there is certainly talent in every generation. However, I do believe that technology comes into play with just how widespread one\u2019s musical influence can become over a short period of time. Let\u2019s suppose sunlight is akin to the heart of the people, clouds in-between represent a political climate, and let a mirror represent music. A certain cloud formation affects the quality of sunlight much in the same way in how the energy wielded by a musician manifests into music mirroring a particular moment in time. With 80\u2019s music, I feel there is a very raw feel to it. An energetic power that\u2019s just not as present in music today. It was a different time, and the clouds in the sky were different. Another phenomenon is the role of technology in music. Case in point, if you were an artist in the 1980\u2019s, singing on-key was a \u201cmake it or break it\u201d skill which you had to develop. Fast forward a few decades and autotuning was developed, which made that much easier. Keep going, and eventually autotuning became standard practice and later evolved into a stylized mainstay of modern pop music. Now, combine autotuning with the common practice of composing music in software using samples vs live instruments, and the variables governing the uniqueness of music become much more easy to divine. As the Youtube video mentions, there has been a change and sharp decline in musical timbre and harmonic complexity in recent years. I believe this is something our ears and brains are naturally able to recognize, and is an important factor to consider in why music doesn\u2019t \u201cpop\u201d the way it used to. TLDR: In short, I find that music of the 1980\u2019s has a lot of clever rhythmic qualities to it with a vocalist style which I greatly enjoy. The energy is big, over the top, and raw. I think the way music was produced then vs now has different psychological effects on the listener. So for these reasons and those I touched on above, I believe 1980\u2019s music is very endearing to those that listen to it and will forever pervade an otherwise quiet day at the office. For those that have become attached to more modern music, the same undoubtedly applies. ",
