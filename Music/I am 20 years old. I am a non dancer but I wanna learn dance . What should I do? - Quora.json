Your body Becomes stiff as you age,,, so I suggest you to start learning from the bacis from this very moment rather than just thinking and being stuck with doing it or not. Learn basics everyday and and than slowly progress towards some more detailed moves as you feel confident learning the basics Don't be afraid to look a bit akward at first cause that's a natural feeling everyone has at the beginning, while practicing look yourself in the mirror and observe each move carefully, handle your body or control it swiftly, don't get mad and give up if you don't get certain moves be patient and try again Practice is the key to everything, so practice practice and practice And walaaaa after few month as you observe yourself improving that's when you get more motivated to learn more and than finally a pro\ud83d\ude09 Fighting, do your best!

Just make sure they offer adult classes before you sign up, you probably don\u2019t want to learn ballet with a bunch of 8\u201310 year olds. ",
