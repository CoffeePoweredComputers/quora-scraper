            "answer_text": "Being the first digital and programmable (i.e. loads of presets) synth on the market put the DX7 in a position where demand exceeded supply. I was in the retail trade at the time. We were told by the Yamaha sales rep \u201cIf you order ten you might get one. They\u2019re being rationed\u201d. We ordered ten and got two, which sold within an hour. Two weeks later we got another. It was sold before it arrived. It went on like this for several weeks - until one day the rep came in said: \u201cYamaha ramped up production and all orders will be fulfilled next week\u201d. By then we had about thirty on order (of which we needed about six) so we cancelled more than twenty of the order, and other retailers were doing the same. There was a glut of DX7 stock in Milton Keynes for about three months. Lesson learned, Yamaha. No other synths, apart from maybe the Korg M1 and Roland D50 which followed later but were then in competition of course with the DX series, caused such a massive buying spree amongst performers. However, if you watch performers on stage, you will see certain instruments that are market leaders. For a while, there was the obligatory Korg Triton, now replaced by the Kronos. Yamaha fans will have a Motif of some flavour. The Nord Stage piano is still a fixture, and so on. It\u2019s now about which manufacturer you support - and sometimes, which one you can get a \u201cdeal\u201d with to get discounted equipment. Endorsements are very popular. I endorse several products, not to get discount, but because I bought them as perfect for my needs and then approached the manufacturer to praise them for a great product, and got offered a deal. Thank you Studiologic, Arturia, and Roli. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s never really been any other synthesizer that\u2019s had the market impact of the Yamaha DX7. On release it became the most sought-after keyboard on the market replacing the Prophet 5, Jupiter 8 and OBX-A as the young synthesists object of desire. The fact that it cost less than half the price of these instruments and had double the polyphony and was velocity sensitive only added to the demand created by releasing an affordable programmable digital synth. A few years after release of the DX7 the US synthesizer manufacturers had all shut down. Moog, ARP and Sequential Circuits simply couldn\u2019t compete with the success of Roland, Yamaha and Korg. Nowadays there\u2019s no single instrument that has leapfrogged the rest of the market as the DX7 did. There are precious few new developments in the mainstream synth market these days and there\u2019s more excitement about the re-issues of Moog, ARP and Sequential Circuits synths than about totally new instruments.
