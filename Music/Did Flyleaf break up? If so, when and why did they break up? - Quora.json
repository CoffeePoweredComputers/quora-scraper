            "answer_text": "They haven\u2019t officially broken up, but after Lacey\u2019s departure the new vocalist Kristen May had a lot of backlash and criticism for \u201cnot being on brand with Flyleaf\u201d or something like that and she dropped out after recording flyleaf\u2019s comeback album \u201cBetween the Stars\u201d. They aren\u2019t officially broken up but without a vocalist I doubt they\u2019d be making music any time soon. Lacey has an album out and it\u2019s great (\u201cLife Screams\u201d) and honestly I didn\u2019t think Between was that bad, I particularly liked Sober Serenade and Thread, as well as the demo Tied to the Broken. It\u2019s unfortunate though, because Flyleaf was a great group I literally grew up with. ",
