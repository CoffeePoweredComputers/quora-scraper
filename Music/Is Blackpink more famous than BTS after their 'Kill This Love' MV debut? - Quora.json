            "answer_text": "Nah. I do understand that BLACKPINK\u2019s music video blew up in terms of views, and now that it\u2019s the third or fourth day, it still is increasing lots. But I don\u2019t think the word \u201cfamous\u201d necessarily has to do with the views right now. When I think of popularity, BTS still has the upper hand, as they\u2019ve been for the past few years. BTS\u2019s popularity has exploded ever since 2015, and the fandom is only growing both domestically and globally. I\u2019m excited and nervous for their comeback on April 12, especially since they\u2019re featuring Halsey, but I\u2019\u2019ll report my thoughts when the time comes for that. Though BLACKPINK\u2019s popularity is also growing very quickly, if you had to compare BTS and BLACKPINK, you could look at it like a logistic curve of K-pop:  To me, BLACKPINK seems to be in the beginnings of the second section of the curve, where the growth is just beginning. BTS are well into the curve at the middle of the second section. So, as a short response, BLACKPINK aren\u2019t more \u201cfamous\u201d than BTS yet. They\u2019re following a bit of the same curve of popularity but at different stages. And at their own pace/level. With that being said, there are are few things in my opinion that could be hindering BLACKPINK form embodying more popularity other than views. Of course, they\u2019re immensely popular already. They\u2019re the models for many CFs in Korea, are topping the charts when they release that once-a-year song, and are loved by so many abroad. They\u2019re performing at Coachella this year, which will bound to increase their popularity even more. Coachella is where all of the influencers, celebrities on social media, and is the perfect formula for their success. Their music caters to a \u201cwestern\u201d audience relatively easily for K-pop, they have beautiful style, attitudes, charisma, ethereal faces, gorgeous bodies, and more that makes them even more likely to succeed during and after Coachella. However, I\u2019ve noticed a few things that could be indicators that they\u2019re not known to everyone, and they still a long way to go as a representation of their group and of K-pop. Their world tour reportedly did not sell out, they only have a few songs to perform at concerts, with many filler performances of cover songs and dances. They only come back once a year, and then they seemingly disappear from the media. Sometimes, the tease is too much. YG seems to overhype their songs too, raising very expectations, only to leave fans disappointed and fuel for some hate. I guess being famous is a double-edged sword. Seems like you can never have love without some hate. ",
