            "answer_text": "Which songs seem to be hard to play on a guitar but actually are not that difficult? I\u2019ve been playing guitar and bass for 21 years, so I feel I can answer this for you. Unlike some answerers here, I feel this is best served by going over the most popular songs to learn on guitar, and see how hard they actually are in terms of technique, nuance, groove, and so forth, with my experience and opinion given at the end of each song, ranking them in terms of difficulty and coolness factor. Because it doesn\u2019t matter how hard the song is, what matters is how fun it is to play, and how cool the song in general is. We\u2019ll take the top 51 most popular songs to learn, according to Songsterr, and see just how difficult they really are. Guitar Tabs with Rhythm | Songsterr #1. \u201cSTAIRWAY TO HEAVEN\u201d - LED ZEPPELIN:  Now, this may be a long song with different moving parts, but it isn\u2019t difficult per se. It\u2019s an intermediate song, in my opinion. You have to have knowledge of chords, fingerpicking, strumming, and good picking technique. The solo is actually quite easy if you know your minor pentatonic scale in all five positions. Difficulty: 4.5/10. Coolness Factor: 9.5/10. This song is a ton of fun to play, and has one of the best chord progressions in rock. #2. \u201cFADE TO BLACK\u201d - METALLICA:  Again, like the first song, it\u2019s a longer song with different moving parts, but it isn\u2019t amazingly difficult. Again, another intermediate song. You have to have knowledge of chords, strumming, and heavy metal rhythm, and great picking technique. The solo is a bit more complex, as you\u2019ll need knowledge of your minor pentatonic scales in all five positions, as well as the natural minor scale. Difficulty: 5/10. Coolness Factor: 8/10. #3. \u201cMASTER OF PUPPETS\u201d - METALLICA:  Ah, now things are getting a bit difficult, but I wouldn\u2019t say this is an advanced song, just a bit trickier than the songs before it. The main thing to develop here is your downpicking endurance, as the rhythm parts are mostly downpicked. Getting the first riffs in time using nothing but downpicking is actually quite challenging, and will test your rhythm chops and endurance. The rhythm for the verses is a bit tricky, but the best advice I can give is to feel the rhythm, not to count it out. The solo is a bit faster, and a bit more tricky, but if you have knowledge of your natural minor and pentatonic scales, you can manage it quite easily. Difficulty: 5.5/10. Mostly because of the downpicking. Coolness Factor: 8.5/10. #4. \u201cHOTEL CALIFORNIA\u201d - THE EAGLES:  Like Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d this is a song that sounds much more difficult than it really is. If you have a capo, this song is actually easy. The solo even isn\u2019t that hard, as it\u2019s just mainly minor pentatonic, but it sounds cool, so it\u2019s worth learning. Difficulty: 3/10. Coolness Factor: 7/10. Mostly because this is really the only Eagles song I like. Crucify me later. #5. \u201cENTER SANDMAN\u201d - METALLICA:  I\u2019m guessing Metallica is super popular with budding young metalheads and Shredi Knights. Anyhow, this song is ridiculously easy, one of the easiest metal songs to learn, to be frank. Beginners can learn it if they practice their chords, palm muting, and know the natural minor and pentatonic minor scales. Difficulty: 2/10. Coolness Factor: 5/10. Sorry, but this one is overplayed, and there\u2019s much cooler Metallica songs, to be frank. #6. \u201cNOTHING ELSE MATTERS\u201d - METALLICA:  Here\u2019s another easy Metallica song, even easier than \u201cEnter Sandman,\u201d believe it or not. That opening chord, you don\u2019t even need to fret anything, it\u2019s all done on the open strings. The lead part at the beginning is cool, though, and again, comes right out of the natural minor scale, so if you know that, you got this song in the bag. Difficulty: 1/10. This is why you don\u2019t let Lars write your opening riffs. Coolness Factor: 4/10. Mostly because that lead part in the beginning is super cool, the rest of the song is ridiculously easy and overplayed. #7. \u201cASTRONOMIA\u201d - TONY IGY:  You\u2019re kidding me, right? There ain\u2019t even a guitar in this song! I suppose if you have a bass, you can learn this song, and if you can play three notes on the bass, you have this song in the bag. Difficulty: 0/10. If you have a bass guitar, you can play this song with your eyes closed. Coolness Factor: 0/10. I guess I just don\u2019t get the appeal of this song. #8. \u201cSWEET CHILD O MINE\u201d - GUNS \u2019N\u2019 ROSES:  A classic riff, classic song. Probably one of the first songs young rockers and Shredi Knights will learn when they first discover dropping the whole guitar down a half step. As far as difficulty, this one is quite easy, but worth learning because of Slash\u2019s melodic playing. Now as far as the solo goes, you need to know your minor pentatonic scales in all five positions, and a great sense of rhythm and feel to nail it, and that can be tricky. Difficulty: 3/10. Not too bad. Subtle nuances of Slash\u2019s playing make it a bit more tricky, but overall, quite simple. Coolness Factor: 4/10. As great as this song is, and as much as I love Slash\u2019s playing, this song is overplayed to death. Just walk into any Guitar Center, and you\u2019ll hear awful renditions of this song. #9. \u201cONE\u201d - METALLICA:  Ah, now we\u2019re cooking with grease! Probably one of the coolest Metallica songs, and actually a bit tricky to get the rhythm perfectly on point. However, the solo is the easiest part of this song actually. Tapping is actually really easy, and if you can tap (which you can easily figure out how to do), then you got this in the bag. Getting the rhythm and the dynamic changes on point though is a bit tougher. Difficulty: 6/10. Coolness Factor: 9.5/10. This song doesn\u2019t get played enough by guitar players, strangely enough, so learning this, you\u2019ll definitely earn some street cred. #10. \u201cKILLING IN THE NAME\u201d - RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE:  One of the first songs you\u2019ll learn when you discover Drop D tuning. This song is actually incredibly easy, and how good you sound with this song is entirely dependent on your sense of groove. If you can\u2019t groove, you\u2019ll sound like shite playing this song. Difficulty: 2/10. You need a strong sense of groove and timing to get it right. Coolness Factor: 8/10. Simple yes. But powerful. #11. \u201cCRAZY TRAIN\u201d - OZZY OSBOURNE:  Ah. A classic metal song. Everyone learns the opening riff in F# minor, but few actually get the verse rhythm correct. The chord accents in the verse actually occur on the upbeat or \u201cands\u201d of each beat, and few actually get the guitar fills right and on time. That\u2019s because they\u2019re actually quite difficult. Randy Rhoads was a phenomenal guitar player, and my fourth favorite guitarist of all time. In fact, I love his guitar tone in this song. Has that classic Marshall grind. The solo is even more of a pain in the ass. Randy had this tendency to fluidly change between natural minor, harmonic minor, and good ol\u2019 minor pentatonic, with such a strong sense of melody and harmony. Might be because of his classical training. Difficulty: 7/10. The verse and choruses aren\u2019t too bad, a bit tricky, but easily doable. You need a strong sense of timing. The solo is quite difficult though, and you better put on your big boy pants if you want to learn it. Coolness Factor: 9/10 or 1/10. Why two ratings? Because if you just learn the main riff, and nothing else, that isn\u2019t cool. If you learn the whole song though? Mad respect, because few actually do. #12. \u201cFLY ME TO THE MOON\u201d - FRANK SINATRA:  Good ol\u2019 Frank! Rare to see Sinatra played on the guitar. Like, at all. To really get this song down, you need to know them fancy jazz chords that sound like vitamins. So you\u2019ll be learning oodles of new and fun chords just to play this one song. Now the trick here is blending that in with the big band jazz sound. You need a particular clean tone to get it right. And finally, you need to have a strong sense of groove, and most important of all, to not overplay. Sinatra is the focal point of this song, after all, so the guitar has to take a backseat and chill out. Difficulty: 3/10. Outside of learning them fancy jazz chords, and not overplaying, this song isn\u2019t too difficult at all. Mostly relies on your sense of groove and your ears to not overplay. Coolness Factor: 9/10. This song is bitchin\u2019 and few actually know this song. #13. \u201cTHE UNFORGIVEN\u201d - METALLICA:  This song isn\u2019t too bad. If you can play \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d you can play this. Difficulty: 4.5/10. Not too terribly difficult. Coolness Factor: 5/10. I dunno, just ain\u2019t my favorite \u2018Tallica song. Crucify me later. #14. \u201cBACK IN BLACK\u201d - AC/DC:  Our first AC/DC song! You\u2019d think that it would have been earlier, right? But anyhow, this song isn\u2019t too hard if you have a strong sense of groove, as this song heavily relies on your sense of groove. The tricky part isn\u2019t even the solos, if you know minor pentatonic, you can play them, it\u2019s actually the bridge section breakdown riff. It\u2019s a bit tricky to get perfectly on time, but as I said, if you rely on your strong sense of groove, it\u2019s easily doable. Difficulty: 4/10. Not too bad. Easy, but can be deceptively tricky at the bridge section. Coolness Factor: 8/10. The song has just cool ass riffs, and are worth your while to learn. #15. \u201cSULTANS OF SWING\u201d - DIRE STRAITS:  This song isn\u2019t too hard, but there things you need to know to get it right. Do not play with a pick, Mark Knopfler never played with a pick. You need to know your closed voice triads. You need a strong sense of groove. The solo isn\u2019t too bad, but getting the arpeggios at the end just right takes a bit of finesse with your fingers. Difficulty: 4/10. A few things you need to know, but overall, not too bad. Coolness Factor: 7/10. A few cool ideas in this song, I just think there are other songs that are cooler. #16. \u201cCALIFORNICATION\u201d - RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS:  Hey, some good ol\u2019 Red Hot Chili Peppers, with John Frusciante! This song is incredibly easy. The solo is so easy that you can play it with one finger. Difficulty: 1/10. Do you have a heartbeat? Because then you can play this song. Coolness Factor: 8/10. The song is great, if incredibly simple. #17. \u201cUNDER THE BRIDGE\u201d - RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS:  Another Chili Peppers song. This one is actually a bit trickier than the previous one, because you need to know your closed voice triads, and a stronger sense of groove to get the song sounding good. Getting the little widdly dee\u2019s in the chords that John Frusciante does in the chords is a bit tricky if you aren\u2019t used to this style of playing, but, not too challenging. Difficulty: 3.5/10. Once you get your closed voice triads, you can basically play this song. Coolness Factor: 9/10 or 1/10. I\u2019ve known many a young Shredi Knight butcher this song because they don\u2019t groove. However, if you have a strong sense of groove, and you get things tight in the pocket, then it\u2019s much cooler. #18. \u201cSEEK AND DESTROY\u201d - METALLICA:  A great song from Metallica\u2019s days when they were straightforward thrash metal. This song relies more on your strong sense of rhythm. The solo is tricky though, and the best advice I can give, is learn the notes, then thrash them, meaning play them with attitude and it\u2019ll sound much better. Difficulty: 5/10. A few tempo changes that can be tricky if you aren\u2019t prepared for them. Coolness Factor: 9/10. Few people actually play stuff from Metallica\u2019s first record. #19. \u201cCOMFORTABLY NUMB\u201d - PINK FLOYD:  I was wondering when we\u2019d be seeing a Pink Floyd song. This song is actually easier than it seems, utilizing a simple but powerful progression. You\u2019ll need to learn some jazz chords to get it sounding right, but that\u2019s well worth your while. Now, the two solos are actually a bit trickier than they sound, because so few have Gilmour\u2019s bending and vibrato technique. The best advice I can give is to hold out your bends and vibrato longer than you feel is necessary. That\u2019s the Gilmour way. In addition, don\u2019t overbend. So many \u201cfeel\u201d based players that idolize Gilmour and disparage me because I\u2019m a metalhead that loves shred, don\u2019t actually bend in tune. Knowing how far to bend, how to control your vibrato is the mark of a pro, and that\u2019s what makes Gilmour awesome. So learn this solo to get your bending and vibrato under control, and it\u2019ll sound much better. Difficulty: 5/10. The song itself isn\u2019t too bad. Some fancy jazz chords that you\u2019ll need to learn, and the solo for some can be tricky to nail, but it isn\u2019t that hard. Coolness Factor: 10/10 or 1/10. If you get the whole song, and the solos right, and you\u2019ve taken my advice on controlling your bends and vibrato, this sounds absolutely killer. But, I\u2019ve heard so many Gilmour enthusiasts and young Shredi Knights butcher this song, because they don\u2019t have any tact. This is one worth slowing down and learning, and taking your time to get just right. #20. \u201cBOHEMIAN RHAPSODY\u201d - QUEEN:  The guitar in this song, believe it or not, goes right down the middle. The groove part in the middle is super easy, but fun. The leads are simple. A few tricky parts here and there, but if you practice them, you\u2019ll have them down in no time. Difficulty: 4/10. You need a sense of groove, and a good melodic ear to get the guitar parts just right. Coolness Factor: 8/10. The guitar parts aren\u2019t too crazy, but they are powerful, and well worth your time learning. 10/10 if you can sing this song too, which I can\u2019t. ;) #21. \u201cGIORNO\u2019S THEM\u201d JOJO\u2019S BIZARRE ADVENTURE OST:  This is pretty rad, an anime theme is a popular song on guitar to learn. That just tickles me pink. The song isn\u2019t crazy, but what really makes this tune is the groove, and if you don\u2019t have groove, this will sound like nails on a chalkboard. The notes are straight out of the blues scale, and if you know that, you can play this song easily. What makes this deceptively tricky is the sick groove. I\u2019d suggest slowing this one down to get that groove. Difficulty: 6/10. Mostly because the groove is a bit tricky for newbies. Coolness Factor: JOJO/10.  #22. \u201cROUNDABOUT\u201d - YES:  Much like the previous one, this song relies on such a strong sense of groove, which can be tricky to get right. You\u2019ll need to know your triads to get it right. Now for you bass players, that main bass groove, as badass as it is, is cool because of its groove, and if you don\u2019t nail it, it sounds like crap. Difficulty: 6/10. Getting the groove just right can be tricky. Coolness Factor: JOJO/10. #23. \u201cCAN\u2019T STOP\u201d - RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS:  Like most Chili Peppers song, this relies on your sense of groove moreso than raw technique. Which, as you\u2019ve guessed is the John Frusciante way. Difficulty: 4/10. Ya need that groove to get it right, son! Coolness Factor: 7/10. Cool if you get the groove right. #24 \u201cTORNADO OF SOULS\u201d - MEGADETH:  Young Shredi Knights learn this song for one reason, and one reason only. That fucking killer guitar solo by the legend Marty Friedman, my second favorite guitarist of all time. The rest of the song is actually quite tricky, and you need to be a confident rhythm player, and learning each riff will take your time. It\u2019s not easy, but once you get the pulse of the song, it becomes much easier. Now that guitar solo. Let\u2019s talk about it. Better put on yer big boy pants, because that solo, to get it just right is actually a massive pain in the ass. Marty\u2019s sense of harmony is top notch, there\u2019s weird arpeggios that you need to learn, you need to have your bends perfectly in control, and unlike Gilmour, you need a wide, deep vibrato. Fret that note hard and shake the piss out of it! That\u2019s what makes Marty so awesome. Not only that, but there\u2019s lots of shred happening here too, which you need to have awesome alternate picking chops to get it right. I learned it, and lemme tell ya, it still is hard to play. Difficulty: 8/10. This one ain\u2019t for the faint of heart. You need to be a confident rhythm player, and have knowledge of several techniques to nail that amazing guitar solo. Coolness Factor: 10/10. This song is so much fun to play, and many Megadeth fans who learn this song can easily butcher it. This is one worth spending loads of time on to get it right. Once you do learn it, you\u2019ll likely have a smile on your face. 11/10 if you get the guitar solo. #25. \u201cSMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT\u201d - NIRVANA:  A classic Nirvana song. This song is incredibly easy to play, and mostly relies on your sense of groove. Difficulty: 2/10. No fancy jazz chords or guitar shreddy things to know. Just power chords and a strong sense of rhythm. Coolness Factor: 4/10. These days, this song is overplayed. #26. \u201cHOLY WARS\u2026 THE PUNISHMENT DUE\u201d - MEGADETH:  Yeehaw, here\u2019s another song that\u2019s easily butchered by budding young Shredi Knights. The problem that many have is that there is a groove to this fast riff that few young Shredi Knights have the tact to get right. And the groove of this song is what makes this song so awesome. Yeah it\u2019s fast, but that doesn\u2019t mean there ain\u2019t no rhythm to it! Slow it down, young ones, and then learn it. On top of that, to get the rhythm right, you need plenty of endurance, and confident picking chops. Now, once you got those, then ramp it up to early 90\u2019s Mustaine cocaine speed. Now the solos, that\u2019s actually going to burn you for a while, because two solos are played by the great Marty Friedman, and learning his stuff is always a challenge. Moreso in this song than \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d you need great bending and vibrato technique. Marty plays with such an aggressive attitude, that once you learn the notes, fret them hard and shake the piss out of them, and pick as hard as you\u2019re able to pick but stay in control. Difficulty: 8/10. Yeah it\u2019s fast, but manageable if you take your time and build it up to speed. The solos are hard, but again, if you slow them down, they\u2019re much more manageable. Coolness Factor: 9/10. Once you get the rhythm and the solos, then this sounds amazing. 1/10 if you didn\u2019t take your time and learn the nuances of this song that make it so great. #27. \u201cWELCOME HOME (SANITARIUM)\u201d - METALLICA:  If you can play \u201cOne\u201d then you can play this song. Moreso in this song, you need to have strong downpicking chops, and great endurance to really make the distorted rhythm guitar parts sound awesome. Difficulty: 6/10. Coolness Factor: 8/10. Not many people play this song. Wonder why. #28. \u201cFEAR OF THE DARK\u201d - IRON MAIDEN:  Ah, my favorite band of all time. This is a classic song. The song itself is actually a bit tricky, and if you\u2019re just a lonesome bedroom guitarist, you\u2019ll never quite get those sick guitar harmonies, because you really need two guitarists to play this song. Now bass players, better put on your big boy pants, because none of Steve Harris\u2019s basslines are easy, and in a song like this with multiple tempo changes, you need to have a killer sense of groove. The solos again, are tricky. Both Janick\u2019s and Dave\u2019s solos, as melodic as they are, have tricky senses of timing, and you need to have full control of your bends and vibrato to really send them to the ionosphere. Moreso in Dave\u2019s solo, since it relies entirely on legato. Difficulty: 6/10. The tempo changes can be tricky, bass players will have a hell of a time, and the solos are a bit tricky, even though they sound so melodic. Coolness Factor: 9.5/10. This song is dope, af, and well worth your time learning it. #29. \u201cWISH YOU WERE HERE\u201d - PINK FLOYD:  This is actually one of the easiest Pink Floyd songs to get. It\u2019s an acoustic song, but you still need to have tact and control in your bends and vibrato, one, because it\u2019s Gilmour, and two because on an acoustic guitar, it\u2019s much harder to have nice sustaining bends and vibrato. The chord progression isn\u2019t too difficult, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t awesome. Difficulty: 4/10. You can manage this one quite easily. Coolness Factor: 5/10. Great song, just I find it\u2019s overplayed and easily butchered by many people. #30. \u201cCANON ROCK\u201d - JERRYC:  Taking classical and metalizing it is a tale as old as time. If you can believe it, this version of Pachelbel\u2019s Canon in D major is actually easier than the original. If you learned any of the above songs, you can play this. Difficulty: 6/10. A bit tricky, but manageable. Coolness Factor: 8/10. Classical always sounds good when it\u2019s metalized, and done properly. #31. \u201cHIGHWAY TO HELL\u201d - AC/DC:  Been a while since our last AC/DC song. This song is quite simple, but powerful, which is the AC/DC way. Difficulty: 3/10. Simple, but awesome. Coolness Factor: 5/10. Like \u201cBack in Black\u201d this song is overplayed. There\u2019s much cooler AC/DC songs. #32. \u201cCLIFFS OF DOVER\u201d - ERIC JOHNSON:   I put two versions of this song, because the live version at Austin City Limits is much cooler than the recorded version. But no matter which one you choose to learn, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time son. This song is ridiculously difficult. And that\u2019s mostly Eric\u2019s penchant for playing five notes across the beat using pentatonic scales, which are played two notes per string. Done correctly you get these killer sounding cascading lines. This means it\u2019s ridiculously hard to pick, and get them sounding clean and in control. In addition, Eric has a great sense of chord knowledge, playing many spread triad voicings which sound so beautiful. On top of that, you need a great sense of rhythm and groove to really make this sound awesome. In short, it\u2019s not easy. In fact, it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult. Difficulty: 9.5/10. Better be ready to put in the work. This will test everything you\u2019ve learned, and will challenge you. Better bring your brown pants. Coolness Factor: 10/10 if you get the studio version down. 11/10 if you get the Austin City Limits live version, which, in my opinion, as far cooler. #33. \u201cORION\u201d - METALLICA:  Great instrumental. Actually quite simple for us guitar players who are used to playing metal. Now, you bass players though better put on your big boy pants, because Cliff\u2019s playing here will test your bass playing chops on every facet. Difficulty: 5/10 for us guitar players. 8/10 for bass players. Cliff played with fingers, so don\u2019t cheat and use a pick! Coolness Factor: 8/10. Few playing the big guitar (bass) can get this song right. #34. \u201cCOME AS YOU ARE\u201d - NIRVANA:  Much like \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d, this song is quite easy. In fact, every guitar player in my high school could play this. Difficulty: 2/10. None of that fancy theory needed. Just simple riffs and chords. Coolness Factor: 5/10. Cooler than \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit.\u201d #35. \u201cBLACKBIRD\u201d - THE BEATLES:  The most popular Beatles song to learn on guitar. It\u2019s actually quite simple, the fingerpicking pattern isn\u2019t too terribly complicated. Difficulty: 2/10. Sounds much more difficult than it really is. Coolness Factor: 4/10. Overplayed in terms of guitar. 9/10 if you can sing on key and play it. But regardless, there\u2019s way cooler Beatles songs to learn, in my opinion. #36. \u201cFOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS\u201d - METALLICA:  Great song. Great for testing out your rhythm chops. The song is simple enough that I say learn it perfectly, then play hard and aggressive, and it\u2019ll sound better. Difficulty: 4/10. The rhythm can be tricky, but if you take your time, you can play it easily in no time at all. Coolness Factor: 9/10 if you add the aggression and play it hard. 1/10 if you play it like a prim and proper lady. What really makes this song and guitar in it so awesome is the aggression. Fret those chords hard and strike them hard. #37. \u201cTHE TROOPER\u201d - IRON MAIDEN:  You\u2019ll need a buddy to play this song with, since what makes the guitar so badass in this song are the dual guitar harmonies. Said harmonies are a bit tricky if you don\u2019t have strong legato technique. In terms of rhythm, this is a perfect song to get acquainted to the metal gallop rhythm. Focus on getting your first note right on the downbeat, and you\u2019ll find the gallop will sound better. Also, since this is metal, play with some conviction for heaven\u2019s sake! Now bass players, like everything else with Iron Maiden, you\u2019re gonna have a hell of a time, because Steve is a phenomenal bass player. Take your time, and get your timing down. Also don\u2019t be a cheater and use a pick! Good ol\u2019 \u2018Arry never played with a pick. Now the guitar solos are actually a bit tricky, so take your time with them. Difficulty: 7/10. Few can get the rhythm right, even fewer bass players can play this correctly, and few can get the guitar solos just right. Coolness Factor: 9/10 if you can get the harmonies right. 9.5/10 if you get the rhythm right, 9.6/10 if you nail the solos, and 10/10 if your bass player can play this correctly. #38. \u201cTHE RIVER FLOWS IN YOU\u201d - YIRUMA SHUNGA:  Great rendition of a piano piece. You need some strong fingerpicking chops to make this sound great. I\u2019d actually suggest using classical fingerpicking technique, where your thumb handles the low E and A strings, and your other fingers play the other strings. Should help in cleaning it up and sounding more posh and classical. Difficulty: 7/10. Piano pieces are always tricky to play on guitar and make them sound good. Coolness Factor: 8.9/10 if you\u2019re like this kid and can play flawlessly. But this song is easily butchered. So take your time with it. #39. \u201cTHROUGH THE FIRE AND FLAMES\u201d - DRAGONFORCE:   Does this song sound hard? Yes. Is it actually hard? Yes, actually. Even the live version pulls no punches. If you look at Sam and Herman, they\u2019re playing the first harmonized lick over the fretboard, instead of under the fretboard as is tradition. The solos are just as hard as they sound, harmonized and requiring the best of chops to nail them. You\u2019ll be at this one for a long time to get it right. Sure, everyone thinks the Guitar Hero version is hard, but actually playing it on a real guitar? Even harder. Not only that, but their sense of feel and melodic sense is top notch. Getting the rhythm down isn\u2019t actually the difficult part, it\u2019s getting the leads down that truly make this song an unholy monster to learn. Difficulty: 9/10. Better be prepared to be annoyed, frustrated, and then elated when you finally nail it. Coolness Factor: 5/10. As hard as this song is, and as well known as it is, there\u2019s cooler DragonForce songs like \u201cCry Thunder.\u201d #40. \u201cASTURIAS (LEYENDA)\u201d - ISAAC ALBENIZ:  Classical guitar is never easy. This song, as cool and simple as that melody sounds is hellishly difficult. You need classical guitar training to even approach learning this song, and you better have flawless fingerpicking technique. Difficulty: 10/10. The hardest song so far on this list. Saddle up, boyo, this song will give you nightmares if you go in unprepared. Coolness Factor: 10/10. #41. \u201cPSYCHOSOCIAL\u201d - SLIPKNOT:  A great song to get your metal rhythm playing chops up to scratch. The rhythm is actually quite tricky, so take your time. The solo, believe it or not, is the easiest part of the song. Difficulty: 6/10. The rhythm is a bit tricky. You need a strong sense of timing. Coolness Factor: 9/10. The best Slipknot song in my opinion. #42. \u201cRAINING BLOOD\u201d - SLAYER:  Yet another song to test your rhythm chops. You need to have strong sense of groove, rhythm, and endurance to play this song. The arrangement of the song, as fast as it is, isn\u2019t actually too crazy, but you need to be a great rhythm player. \u201cBut Colton! What about those solos?\u201d HA! You think there\u2019s technique involved in a Slayer solo?! If you have a guitar with a whammy bar, just grab a hold of that there kickstand, shake the crap out of it, and you can make all sorts of unholy noises come out of that fiddle. And I\u2019ve just explained the majority of Slayer solos. Except for \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d you\u2019ll actually need technique to play that one. Difficulty: 5/10. The speed of the song makes it sound harder than it actually is. Coolness Factor: 5/10. The most overplayed Slayer song in my opinion. There\u2019s other Slayer songs that are cooler, in my opinion. #43. \u201cSYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION\u201d - MEGADETH:  The easiest MegaDave song. Rhythm\u2019s just simple, the chorus is simple but awesome. \u2026.Until you get to that solo. Yep, that\u2019s Marty Friedman again, and like his other solos, this one\u2019s gonna test your chops, kid. Better saddle up if you want to play the solo properly. Difficulty: 5/10. Mostly because that solo is a pain in the ass. The rest of the song is simple. Coolness Factor: 1/10, if you didn\u2019t learn the solo. 9/10 if you did. #44. \u201cMOONLIGHT SONATA FOR SOLO FINGERPICKED GUITAR\u201d - LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN:  Don\u2019t let the simple the melody fool you, classical pieces are always tricky to nail. Take your time. Difficulty: 5/10. The easiest Beethoven song to learn. Attempt Beethoven\u2019s other pieces if you dare. Coolness Factor: 8/10. #45: \u201cSNOW (HEY OH)\u201d - RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS:  Sounds easy right? In fact, that main riff is much harder than it sounds, and is the most difficult Chili Peppers song. This one will test your chops. Difficulty: 5/10. That main riff is a pain. Coolness Factor: 9/10 if you get it down. #46. \u201cCANON IN D MAJOR FOR SOLO GUITAR\u201d - PACHELBEL:  Classical pieces are always a bit difficult. Take your time with this one. Difficulty: 8/10. Do not be fooled by the simple melody, this one\u2019s a monster if you want to learn the classical version. Coolness Factor: 9/10 if you\u2019re like this old dude and playing it like a boss. #47. \u201cSWEET HOME ALABAMA\u201d - LYNYRD SKYNYRD:  If you know the chords D major, C major, and G major, you can play this song. What a coincidence! Those happen to be the first chords you learn! Who woulda thought? Difficulty: 1/10. A child that just started guitar can start learning this. Coolness Factor: 1/10. This song is overplayed to death. There\u2019s much cooler Lynyrd Skynyrd songs like \u201cSwamp Music.\u201d #48. \u201cJOHNNY B. GOODE\u201d - CHUCK BERRY:  If you got your minor pentatonic down, this is great to learn Chuck Berry style double stop licks. Simple progression, groovy song, and you can easily learn it no problem. Difficulty: 2/10. Hey, I never said it wasn\u2019t awesome, just easy. Coolness Factor: 9/10. Learn this all the way through, it ain\u2019t too hard, and I think you can manage it. #49. \u201cIRON MAN\u201d - BLACK SABBATH:  This song is easy. However\u2026 So many guitarists, because of the movie School of Rock have learned this riff in the completely wrong key.  The song is in the key of B minor, not E minor, Jack! For heaven\u2019s sake! So here we have a simple song so easily butchered because so many budding rock guitar players trusted this movie over their own ears. Difficulty: 1/10, yet you may be playing it wrong. Coolness Factor: 2/10, because this song is so overplayed. There\u2019s much better Black Sabbath songs to learn, in my opinion like \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d \u201cThe Sign of the Southern Cross,\u201d \u201cWar Pigs,\u201d and \u201cHeaven and Hell.\u201d #50. \u201cTEARS IN HEAVEN\u201d - ERIC CLAPTON:  Song\u2019s actually quite easy, as is many of Eric Clapton\u2019s stuff. Difficulty: 2/10. Simple, but powerful. Coolness Factor: 2/10. Eh, I think Clapton\u2019s done cooler stuff. #51. \u201cTHUNDERSTRUCK\u201d - AC/DC:  Everyone oohs and ahhs at that opening guitar lick, but it is much simpler than it sounds. You can even play it without picking it and raise your picking hand with the horns, like Angus does! Like other AC/DC songs, there\u2019s not much else, really. Just all groove. Difficulty: 2/10. Hey, I never said it wasn\u2019t awesome, just easy. Coolness Factor: 9/10. CONCLUSION: So those are the top 51 songs that guitarists are learning, according to Songsterr, and I gotta say, only a handful of them are actually what I would consider tricky or difficult. The majority of them are actually simple enough for a beginner or intermediate guitarist to play. Hope that answers your question! :D EDIT: To all the people saying this list is mine, or that there\u2019s too much Metallica on this list, I didn\u2019t create this list. The list is straight from the guitar tablature site Songsterr, and I just took the top 51 most popular songs. Apparently people really want to learn Metallica songs. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is: almost all of them. One thing I\u2019ve realized over the years is that most of the music made in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, at the height of \u2018guitar rock\u2019, was made by musicians in their early 20\u2019s or younger. It\u2019s astounding how much great music was made by people who in most cases hadn\u2019t been playing for more than a few years. Clapton had only been seriously playing guitar for 3 years when he joined the Yardbirds; Page had maybe 4 years under his belt when he started a career as a session guitarist. The result is that the music they made tends to be a lot simpler than people expect. Most musicians at the time simply didn\u2019t know much beyond the pentatonic scale. And if we look back even further to the roots of rock music in the blues we find the same thing. The guys who created electric blues in the 1950\u2019s, like their acoustic predecessors, were far from being trained musicians. In most cases someone would show them the minor pentatonic scale and that would be as far as their education went. My rule of thumb when trying to learn a new song is to try and pick out the basic melody in either box 1 minor pentatonic or open position. I always thought Stairway To Heaven would be impossible to learn; turns out it\u2019s entirely minor pentatonic in A. The flip side to these songs being much simpler than you expect is that you gain an appreciation for how enormously talented and creative these artists were and are. 99.9% of guitarists play the minor pentatonic scale and it sounds just like the minor pentatonic scale\u2026we see it as a tapped out, cliche\u2019d part of the fretboard. The great musicians play the same notes and find classic song after classic song hidden in there. Anyway, apologies for rambling, but to answer the question, most songs are much easier to play than you think. Try finding the basic melody in the minor pentatonic (or major pentatonic if it\u2019s southern rock) and build it up from there. ",
