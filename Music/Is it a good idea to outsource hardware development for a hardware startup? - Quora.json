            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure that building a hardware company, nevertheless, outsourcing the hardware, is possible at all with $20K \u2014 outsourced resources are very expensive, and real hardware companies credibly need at least $1M to bring a product to market, and very often significant amounts more. What about the general case? Is it a good idea to outsource hardware development (at a hardware startup)? It is possible. Is it a good idea? Generally, no. There are relatively rare exceptions. If you\u2019re a hardware startup, your core technology is likely in the hardware. As a founder myself, I generally follow the rule that you should never outsource your core technology -- that should always be built in house. You can definitely build really lean hardware teams that are augmented by outsourced resources to split the difference between product risk and financial burn. In rare cases, your core technology might not be in the hardware, it\u2019s all about the software that goes with it -- in that case, you may be able to outsource significant parts of it, with caveats: Always have someone in-house who owns the factory relationship. Don\u2019t outsource this because any firms helping with this don\u2019t truly have aligned incentives with yours, which are to ship on-time, on-budget, at high levels of quality. Besides, if you own the relationship, you have more transparency into the costs and can develop rapport that will be key when there are problems with the product later (and there will always be problems\u2026)I know I\u2019m biased as a mechanical engineer myself, but usually you\u2019ll want to also keep the fundamental mechanical engineering in-house. In an early stage company, this person often wears five or six different hats, including the design of the product, vendor selection, reliability testing, quality engineering, and sometimes pieces of program management or factory relationship. If you hire someone with former BigCo experience shipping at least one high-quality product into volume, they will save you significant money in the long run by wearing multiple hats and avoiding making costly mistakes.It\u2019s definitely possible to be \u201ca hardware startup\u201d without a real \u201chardware team\u201d -- but I\u2019ve seen that be truly successful only once. In that case, the core technology was software, where much of the focus was, and the team included a very experienced person to manage the factory relationship who also managed a large number of contractors and consultants assisting with building the hardware. When the final bills were due, it likely would have been cheaper to do much of that work in-house with one or two experienced resources. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "We've tackled this problem at ProtoExchange; an outsourcing platform designed around hardware.  One of the biggest dangers about outsourcing is that you're not necessarily dealing with an expert in a specific field. A lot of design/development firms are OK in their work, but do not have the right tools and right engineers for every job. As a result, your $20k investment can be better spent by selecting specific hardware experts. From what we've learned, specialized experts can operate more efficiently and effectively when given domain-specific tasks. Smaller, short-term projects have better results and the engineer is focused on a subset of the product. If you're interested, check out ProtoExchange for more information. We'd be happy to help and offer our advice. ",
