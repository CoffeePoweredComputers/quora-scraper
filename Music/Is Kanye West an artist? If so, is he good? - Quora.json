            "answer_text": "The meaning of \"artist\" has changed.  Looking back throughout history, it would be a safe to state that what we see as \"artists\" is no longer the same.  This applies with particular force concerning those who study the history of art.  Artistry: then and now.  For a considerable amount of time, artists were usually pioneers. They paved the way to new genres and concepts. They expanded the human experience. But what about now?  A reasonable argument is that the \"creativity\" used now is quite different than the \"creativity\" used back then. Beethoven, Mozart, Mahler, etc are generally accepted to be creatives and creative geniuses.  This question is not without merits. The trend for current music no longer evolves, some would say. Truthfully, it's not an absurd argument. In the realm of rap, some-if not MOST- of the popular songs borrow heavily from previous musicians. I do not mean some melodies or some harmonies. I mean the actual sound and voice of the singer. This is called sampling. Rappers, Kanye included, don't recreate the sound they like, they actually USE a portion of a copyrighted song.  It is a safe guess that rap is probably a genre that pays the most royalty fees than antithetical genre.  Artists no longer pioneer.  Since we have covered the topics above, it seems to suggest that what we see as \"creative\" or \"musicians\" no longer create original work. They capitalize on re-used work.  Kanye, thus far, hasn't been a foundation for other works. Nor can he. If another artist likes Kanye, there isn't anything \"Kanye\" he could incorporate into his music. He could sample, yes. But what else? There is no distinctive feature of Kanye or his work, regardless of popularity.  Paying attention to other genres, we see how it has been able to build of its past to create new works. The eras of classical music. Blues to jazz to rock and roll to metal and all of the sub genres therein.  Where can we go from Kanye? More sampling? Again the point is that a \"creative\" is no longer viewed the same. Calling Kanye the most influential rapper, or artist, of our generation is just an opinion. It is equally valid to the opinion that Kanye is the most uninfluential rapper/artist of our generation.  Lastly, success is not indicative of creativity or on the artistic(ness) of an individual. To use sales or popularity to support the argument that someone is or isn't an artist is weak and unrelated.  We know of many examples where artists, of any medium, were overlooked and ignored. Once they passed away, however, their work became sought after.  If we use the success of someone to support the artistry and creativity of an individual, that would mean that some artists weren't artists/creative while living, but became creative or an artist after death. This, to me, is silly.  Lastly part II, if success were an indicator of a person's status within their respective realms, DONALD TRUMP would be a great republican nominee (we know this is not true).  In short, creativity is no longer what it once was and the concept had been expanded to the point of subjectivity. This means that every post, including mine, is worthless in the pursuit of objectivity. There is none.  I do not think Kanye fits in my definition of creative. Or creative genius (I don't know what that even means).  To me, he is a guy who capitalizes from media attention and understands that arrogance sells. In that regard, he's brilliant.  I'm gonna go buy a $2,500 sweater with holes in it now. Oh, throw in some shoes of questionable quality as well.  #yeezus ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm... I was asked to answer this otherwise I wouldn't have since I have actually never listened to him before now.  So. I just youtubed 3 of his songs - Mercy, which is what I said as well, after a very short period of time.  I am pretty sure it is about the fact that his girl has a great ass. Apparently, he can roll joints on it. Or maybe he was talking about one time when he rolled his joint on it. Also, he is going to build a house on that ass. Another chick is thirsty and is trying to jerk him. He would also like someone else to make their ass shake because that's an ass-quake.  Then I watched a SNL live performance called Black Skinhead in which the very large words Not for Sale were projected onto a screen behind the band. If this was intentional self parody commenting on the fact that he is married to Kim Kardashian, then I guess it's possible he is an artist.  There is another piece in which he shares billing with Rhianna called Turn up the Lights. It is surprisingly mellow, like a 1970s airline advertisement. It contains this warning at the front: WARNING: This video has been identified by Epilepsy Action to potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.  You're kidding?  Not  Warning - This song contains original ideas and language that may offend the more conservative among you.  No.  Warning - This song may make you have a seizure.  Is Kanye an artist? If it were up to me to judge, I'd say no. In the small amount of his work I've just seen, I note no profound insights into the nature of existence. I saw no attempt to uncover the beauty or conversely, the ugliness of life. I heard no cleverness with language in the lyrics.  Someone involved certainly has a great beat, but that doesn't necessarily make Kanye an artist. It just makes someone he knows a drummer.  But I won't make a pronouncement either way because I haven't listened to enough of his work, maybe somewhere in there is some great music. It's not that I can't appreciate rap; my daughters have introduced me to some fantastic rap that is both beautiful and moving in one way or another. It's not that I can't appreciate dischordant music; I love Tom Waits, bluegrass and the bagpipes. It's just that I couldn't see a single thing about Kanye's work that transcended Kanye talking about Kanye.  PS: Always happy to be proven wrong about these things. Please feel free to direct me to some great Kanye West music and I'll come back and tell you if you've changed my mind. ",
