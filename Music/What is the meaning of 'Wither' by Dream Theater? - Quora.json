            "answer_text": "\u2018Enlightenment\u2019 or to be more accurate, the feeling of giving up one\u2019s ego and all the problems it has created: The chorus \u201cSo I wither, And render myself helpless, I give in and everything is clear\u201d is very Buddhist in nature, not trying to gain something, but losing all \u2018hang-ups\u2019 and seeing the world clearly, without the usual backdrop of dread. The Middle 8th lyrics would make Alan Watts smile: \u201cI drown in hesitation, My words come crashing down, All my best creations are burning to the ground.\u201d The band also made good chord decisions. The darker verses are musically interesting using Bbm-Fm as the setup. The chorus is done in standard 4-chord pop format - the right thing to do for inspirational themes. The choice of C# is much \u2018darker\u2019 than the pure C.  Lyrics: Let it out, let it outFeel the empty SpaceSo insecure find the words and let it out Staring down, staring downNothing comes to mindFind the place turn the water into wine But I feel I'm getting nowhereAnd I'll never see the end So I witherAnd render myself helplessI give in and everything is clearI breakdownAnd let the story guide me Turn it onTurn it onLet the feelings flowClose your eyesSee the ones you used to know Open up open upDon't struggle to relateLure it outHelp the memory escapeStill transparentness consumes meAnd I feel like giving up So I witherAnd render myself helplessI give inAnd everything is clearI breakdownAnd let the story guide me I witherAnd give myself away Light reflections on the cageThe worlds want to create I drown in hesitationMy words come crashing downAnd all my best creationsBurning to the ground The thought of staring overLeaves me paralyzedTear it out againAnother one that got away I witherAnd render myself helplessI give inAnd everything is clear I witherAnd render myself helplessI give inAnd everything is clearI breakdownAnd let the story guide meI witherAnd give myself away Light reflections on the cageThe worlds want to createThe worlds which you create Let it out let it out Source: LyricFind Songwriters: John Petrucci Wither lyrics \u00a9 Warner Chappell Music, Inc ",
