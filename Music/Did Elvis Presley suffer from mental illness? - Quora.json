            "answer_text": "Elvis Presley had issues. He was pathologically attached to his mother Gladys to the point that he could not have sex with a woman who gave birth. He was heartbroken after Gladys died and a part of him died with her. The fact that he wanted to be mothered by a woman says it all. When he was in hospital he held Linda Thompson\u2019s hand non stop. At the same time he liked very young women. That was the main reason for his divorce with Priscilla. Elvis met Priscilla when she was 14 years old and she moved in with him when she was 16. They married when she was 22 years old and welcomed their first and only child within a year at which point he lost sexual interest in her, hence their divorce. Elvis was a womanizer and he had numerous adulterous affairs which everyone knew about including Priscilla. She cheated on him with two men, one of whom was his karate instructor Mike Stone, whom Elvis wanted to kill at some point. Elvis was taken aback by Priscilla\u2018s decision to divorce him, his ego was really hurt. Elvis had an inflated yet fragile ego. He neglected Priscilla yet her decision to leave him hurt him. Priscilla left Elvis but he filed for the divorce first to satisfy his hurt ego. He didn\u2019t want her to have his last name after the divorce. It never occurred to him that maybe she wasn\u2019t happy being constantly cheated on, deprived of sex and left alone. I don\u2019t think he was \u2018\u2019husband\u2019\u2019 material. He couldn\u2019t be faithful to a woman. Linda Thompson said he broke his record of faithfulness the first year they were together. Then, he cheated on her non stop. According to Priscilla he would always give her a present after an indiscretion or a fight, that was his idea of dealing with his marital problems, which means that he had no clue from the dynamics of a marriage. Also, Elvis had mood swings and a temper. At some point, he gave Priscilla a black eye and he even threw a chair at her. I think he may have suffered from depression. He was bulimic, he would stay at home all day, with the drapes closed, he suffered from insomnia, he had a temper, he was pathologically dependent on his Memphis Mafia friends, he was idle and passive. Also, he was self destructive. All these are symptoms of depression. Elvis did everything in excess. He lacked control and discipline, which is indicative of people who suffer from depression. He bought too many cars, he wore too much jewelery, he wore too flashy costumes, he ate too much, he spent too much money. He had an uncontrollable appetite for food, hence his weight gain. Instead of adopting a healthy diet to help him lose weight he went on dangerous crash diets , during which he ate only grapefruit and melon, but a lot of it. He even put himself to an induced coma to stop himself from eating. He could have consulted a nutritionist, a therapist or a pathologist to help him deal with obesity and bulimia which he no doubt had but he chose the easy way. In a way he was superficial and short sighted. He was willing to put himself in a coma to lose weight so as to improve his looks yet he had no interest in his health whatsoever, hence he was diabetic, he suffered from constipation and hypertension. Elvis was insecure and deeply hurt by the nasty comments about his weight which meant that he cared about his looks and his image more than his own health. Does that mean he was a vain person? I don\u2019t know. Elvis had a personality that made him prone to anything addictive. Cigars, drugs, food. Food was a release for him, he comfort ate, which means that he wasn\u2019t happy. Why was he sad if he seemingly had everything? Could it be because he was not really loved but his \u2018\u2019friends\u2019\u2019 and the women were in it for the money? Elvis surrounded himself with \u2018\u2019yes\u2019\u2019 people who didn\u2019t dare tell him \u2018\u2019NO\u2019\u2019 for they would lose their benefits. Elvis would not take no for an answer and they knew it. If he didn\u2019t get his way he got really upset. In the end he was impossible to live with and women left him. He had a tendency to shoot at electrical appliances and TV sets. Was he angry? Paranoid from long term drug use? Who knows? His daughter Lisa Marie Presley seems to have similar traits. She has 4 failed marriages, she comfort eats, she battles a cocaine addiction since she was 14, she also likes to sleep around, she has out of control spending habits and she is no doubt self destructive. Currently she is broke, she has been to rehab 5 times last decade alone, divorced from her #4 estranged husband Michael Lockwood recently. This is a repeated pattern in her life which in fact is a vicious circle of drug use, deadbeat husbands and out of control spending habits. She finds release in sex, which is probably a result of growing up in a family where both parents slept around. She finds a release in food and she struggles with weight gain, which she seems to lose only when she abuses cocaine. She is a street junkie since she was 14 years old which means that either she tried to get someone\u2019s attention by taking drugs or she tried to escape from her reality. She was sexually active at 14. Usually promiscuous girls have been sexually molested. Could one of her mother\u2019s boyfriends have sexually molested her? She doesn\u2019t seem to be able to form a healthy relationship with a man. She has boyfriends and husbands but she ends up divorcing all the time. She found no interest in school. She dropped out of school at 14. These are traits of people who have been sexually abused. She is no doubt self destructive. Her half brother Navarone battles a drug addiction too so their mother Priscilla obviously did something very wrong. These are some traits of Elvis\u2019 personality: bulimia; nobody needs 13000 calories diet daily, especially when it consists exclusively of eggs, bacon, steak, peanut butter, beef, ice cream, cookies. He might as well have injected cholesterol in his blood, he slowly ate himself to death, his bad and unhealthy diet eventually killed himinsomnia; he slept all day and he stayed up all night long, he would stay all alone in Graceland without ever getting out FOR DAYS. That is a need to escape from reality, which means that he clearly wasn\u2019t happy with his lifeunable to form healthy and longterm relationships with women; he liked particularly young and beautiful women and he treated them like a Barbie doll in a doll house. Elvis could not even fathom why Priscilla would want a divorce even if he cheated on her non stop, he was a notorious philanderer, he couldn\u2019t be faithful to a womanuncontrollable anger; which he released by shooting at furniture and electrical appliancesa love for guns, the army and the police; which means that he needed to have some sort of control that way, which he clearly lacked as a personpathologically attached to his mother to the point he could not have sex with a woman who gave birth and he gradually lost interest in life in general after his mother Gladys passed awayno grasp of money; he bought 10 Mercedes Benzes and 32 shotguns for Christmas aloneprone to anything addictive; drugs, food, cigarsidle, passive, paranoid probably due to long term drug use; he would spend days and days in Graceland, doing nothing, staying in bed all day, shooting at the TV sets and at furniture",

            "answer_text": "Elvis isn\u2019t known to have any specific mental illness. There are, however, behaviors which suggest some questionable emotional issues. Elvis experience a great deal of loss in his life: his twin brother, Jesse Garon, the end of his marriage to Priscilla, and the seminal importance of the death of Elvis\u2019 beloved mother, Gladys. There was the loss of a possible career the Colonel stole from him, the impotence he felt stuck in contracts and career tracks, which took him from what he was gravitating to at the peak of his career. When the Beatles visited Graceland one afternoon, Elvis and his guests finally got around to jamming and story swapping. History says the Colonel saw this, didn\u2019t like the draw to the (very free-willed) lads, and about midnight, interrupted the famous meeting , and sent the lads off home. Midnight! They could have jammed all night certainly, he WAS an idol to them. It\u2019s also said Parker allowed no video or audio of the visit. What would that have been like to watch! Elvis seemed from the start to be especially shy, conflict averse, a loner, and potentially suffering a depressive disorder (either parent contributed genetically). Some of these issues could have been responsible for Elvis\u2019 unusual attachment to his mother; she became his world. This topic could require a thesis to justice to. There was a dichotomy to his bond with his mother. (Elvis as a natural blonde, a young boy, with his beloved mother, Gladys)  While she represented all that was good, safe, and reliable in his life, there\u2019s also a good chance Elvis was at least vaguely aware, his mother was a prison for him, the attachment and need to please was so strong. To create a separation in his psyche, Elvis was obsessed with gorgeous teen girls, the literal antithesis of his mother. It\u2019s been noted he could not have intercourse with a woman once she had given birth. Elvis wanted a life that others kept taking from him. Colonel Parker, whom he trusted with his life, was in fact a flimflam man, one who stole Elvis\u2019 talent for personal gain. At some level, I believe Elvis was aware of the dynamics at play. Not crisply so, or seeing the specifics at work, but the vague sense he was always thwarted by someone/something, and could never take control to make his life his own. Later in his career, he longed to do some Rock songs, become a bit more aligned with the later 1960s when the Beatles were in the thick of their creativity. Parker said \u2018No\u2019, to that, and Elvis went back to Gospel, Adult Contemporary, and his usual mix including musicals (Elvis hated the films he was contractually tied to). But again, unable to pull strings, make demands, as other artists did, and extricate himself from the course others had chosen for his career. While no formal diagnosis has been made, there is a condition that seems to reflect much of what he struggled with. \u201cWilliams syndrome\u201d \u2014 a genetic disorder that can bring developmental delays and very mild mental retardation, along with an overly friendly and trusting personality. Remarkably, those diagnosed with Williams Syndrome, experienced a spike in the hormones (associated with love and loving feelings) oxytocin and arginine vasopressin (AVP), when music played. Individuals without this condition saw little or no change in their oxytocin and AVP levels while listening. Interesting! A new study shows that when people with Williams syndrome listen to Elvis\u2019 \u201cLove Me Tender,\u201d to that song or others, they experience more distinct and higher levels of the hormones associated with feelings of love. This is all conjecture based on (1.) the understanding of the Williams Syndrome, and (2.), looking back at Elvis\u2019 life and how this might have been a factor. His reacting to music with loving feelings, and singing those very songs, might have been a remarkable experience, almost a true \u201chigh\u201d, for Elvis (and his fans - all reacting to his voice, music, and presence or persona). The love from his audience would have been an exaggerated loving experience. If Elvis could have found the words, at the end he might have mused, \u2018What A Long, Dark, Ride It\u2019s Been.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "\u2026.thangyaveramuch for requesting an answer from me! as a huuuge elvis fan, i don\u2019t think he had any form of mental illness. first, let me begin with how it fascinates me how icons adjust to all the adoration. there are a rarefied few who have ever even experienced fame on a level that elvis did - without any real road map to follow. the beatles had each other to help cope and were directly influenced and reaping benefits from elvis\u2019 career, yet still made mistakes - lennon was right as, before elvis, there was nothing! perhaps the closest one, p.e. who\u2019s ascendance came close was sinatra, musically, but even his fame didn\u2019t approach elvis-level when you really think about it. i think, on that level, you have a guy like brando where every generation of same era and subsequent actors looked to him as that one figure who defined their lives and careers w/almost sycophantic adoration\u2026how does one cope w/that? post elvis, only muhammad ali had that kind of genre/industry dominance where you are that one and only figure who separates whatever came before from everything that comes after. in reggae, you had marley; in martial arts you had bruce lee, but, still neither on elvis\u2019 level. elvis was the only public figure i know of who was known around the world by his 1st name and never performed outside the country other than a jaunt, or two, to canada in the \u201850s. in addition, elvis was in high school in \u201853, started making his way in \u201854, became a regional buzz in \u201855, and achieved global dominance in \u201956 until he died and beyond. as such, who else went from total obscurity to omnipresence in 2 yrs and stayed in the upper echelon of power players? nobody. further, elvis still hold records that may never be broken. some have only recently been broken - the list of his accomplishments and records is way too extensive for me to name in this already lengthy response. finally, how many other acts were chart dominant every year of their career - for elvis some 22 years? i believe he was always one of the top 5 acts from the \u201950\u2019s - \u201870\u2019s. now, against this backdrop, add in a young, impressionable, humble, good-natured/-mannered southerner who was patriotic yet rebellious, polished but raw, simple yet complex, spiritual but sensual. elvis had issues, for sure, but who doesn\u2019t? like howard hughes before him, elvis had complexes that would be easily diagnosed and treatable today, so he was ahead of his time, unfortunately. however, none of his idiosyncrasies takes away from his talent, his legacy, or his legend. he is still, for me, the single greatest figure in rock & roll, if not 20th century popular music. now that\u2019s not to say he was more influential than, say, louis armstrong - who i believe was popular music\u2019s closest comparison to abraham in the bible - in that everything ppl are doing today, vocally, performance-wise, and musically can be drawn back generationally to him\u2026but elvis shines above everyone else as far as impact, and is why i consider him the big bang of popular music!

            "answer_text": "First, I\u2019m not a medical doctor nor clinical psychologist, so I\u2019m going to look at mental illness from a different perspective. It is from the perspective of looking at Elvis as being a universally recognized famous unique individual. Disregard whether or not you\u2019re a fan; whether you loved or hated him. Simply try to imagine that everything that you did, said, thought, etc was open season for the entire world to comment upon. What foods you ate, what clothes you wore, the cars you drove, what you drank, every single thing about you was important to someone. And everyone, everyone wanted to profit in some way from being close to you or knowing something about you. And in Elvis\u2019 case there was Col. Tom Parker who did make money on every single thing Elvis did. Next, imagine that every time you said something, anything, someone was there to try and fix it or take care of it. You\u2019re thirsty? What would you like to drink? Hungry? What would you like to eat? Headache? Aspirin, Tylenol or something stronger? Sounds great! Or does it? As humans, we normally do stuff, and as we get more specialized in the stuff that we do, we hire people to do the lesser stuff. Elvis had people to do all of his stuff except his performances: in studio, on stage or on camera, which were just a couple of hours a day but not that often during the mid- to late-sixties when he was doing mostly movies. I think that may be why he did the Las Vegas thing in the 70\u2019s so he could perform more, and have a purpose; have stuff to do. I think that his mind began to suffer the 60\u2019s when he was doing movies; i.e., when he didn\u2019t have enough stuff to do because everyone would do stuff for him and he wasn\u2019t allowed to do stuff because of his movies contracts. The thing that Elvis did and that only Elvis could do, sing like Elvis, he wasn't doing much of it. Though it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t do anything at all. He became a black belt in martial arts (Karate?), wanted to join law enforcement and work for Richard Nixon. He wanted to do stuff (kinda crazy stuff), but the world wanted him to perform: movies, TV, songs, stage, etc. And so this was his form of mental illness. He was trapped being Elvis and not being able to do Elvis or do other stuff. His mental illness in the sense I\u2019ve tried to describe was that he wasn\u2019t allowed to be mentally healthy. And ultimately, it was everyone\u2019s desire to please Elvis instead of caring for Elvis that made it worse for him; and therefore, all of us too. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the thing - Elvis Presley was never diagnosed for any kind of psychological evaluation while he was alive. Any thing we know about him today was done after he was dead. We can speculate, but we really don\u2019t know. Its possible that he suffered from bipolar disorder, which is a more technical name for manic depression. Elvis\u2019 substance abuse, eating disorders, and chronic depression should be placed in the larger context of a personality disorder. What we know about his behavior in the years and months prior to his death is legion, but as to the cause - well, that\u2019s just speculation. As an example, much has been made about the food that he ate. Fried foods, fried meat, even two or three cheeseburgers at a single meal. To many writers of the day that was pretty peculiar and is still commented on all the time - even introspectively - unless you were from the South, as he was. That was pretty common back then. At that time of his life, Mr. Presley was suffering from depression, diabetes and prescription drug abuse. That would be enough for any man and it was a sad way to go. ",

And the Colonel Parkers of the world, good as he might have been for making Elvis what he became, probably demanded a lot from Elvis. Elvis was a sweet, nice boy from Memphis who loved his Mama through and through and was distraught when she died. No, I don\u2019t think Elvis was ever mentally ill but the entertainment world was so demanding that it\u2019s easy to succumb to drugs and drink. I don\u2019t excuse him but I understand that he must have wakened in the mornings and said, \u2018What happened? Where am I, how did I get here, am I that good, why are all those women screaming at me (me included) and wanting a piece of me?\u201d How do you maintain your sanity in the midst of all of that?

I would have to say that yes he did in the form of drug and alcohol addiction which is the same mental illness that millions of other people have to deal with including me. Many experts would probably disagree with me on that addiction is not a mental illness but rather a mental disorder or something like that, but wouldn't go as far to say that it is a mental illness. There has to be something wrong with your brain that would justify your putting yourself in danger just to get high every day of your life to escape from reality. I can understand that Elvis Presley had to deal with the stress of being famous and that everyone wanted to have a piece of his life, but when you turn to drugs and alcohol to escape from life and its problems then there has to be some kind of mental illness that you are dealing with too. Like I said before this is my opinion if addiction is a mental illness or not and in my humble opinion it is, and I think that Elvis suffered from the same illness that I have which is the life long mental illness of addiction.

Do people that commit suicide all suffer from mental illness? I think Elvis suffered from depression - and this depression was the root cause of his drug addiction. Grief causes depression - the loss of self esteem, or the loss of a very close family member (parent, spouse, etc). I have known several people that committed suicide, and the common factor has been grief. Elvis was extraordinarily close to his mother, and her death at a relatively young age, caused a cataclysmic change in his attitude, behavior and perspective. His divorce, years later, compounded an already elevated level of self destruction. No - I do not believe that Elvis was mentally ill, anymore than I believe that Janis Joplin, Jimmy Hendrix, Amy Weinstein or James Morrison (Doors) were mentally ill. They were not retarted - they simply couldn\u2019t deal with their inner-demons. ",

Addiction is a maladaptive behavior or action to (often subconsciously) avoid, dull, or eliminate any painful feeling, memory, or concept in a person\u2019s life. Addiction can mimic closely sometimes a mental disorder because the withdrawals, side affects (of any chemical alteration), cravings, moods, and alteration in behavior to get the addiction are similar. The cycle of addiction can cause an array of erratic emotional responses and behavior as well. This is why mental disorders and addictions are not treated as the same and of many instances fail because of the illiterate and unknowledgeable educational background some practitioners implement in actions towards their patients. Addictions are a deep rooted behavior that is conditioned to ease or eliminate any form of pain which needs to be relearned and mental disorders are derived from a chemical imbalance that needs pharmacological approaches to treat.

But Elvis over did it because he could and like most addicts always had a reason for taking the drugs any of them and was a person that knew he can pay for his drugs no matter where he got them. Not mental case just a drug addict with plenty of money,to keep him over taking and no one can stop Elvis because his money and fame ruled. ",
