            "answer_text": "In the 19th century, people began to distinguish \"classical music\" (Bach through say, Schubert) from the \"new music\", which we now call Romantic.  Every period has something called the New Music.  Mozart's friends called Bach the Old Music, and Stamitz/Haydn/Mozart were the New Music.  Beethoven was a separate creature, considered a wild, uncontrollable element tolerated only because he had an enormous amount of talent.  Romantic Music was, to oversimplify, taking up where Beethoven had left out, exploring new levels of harmony and rhythm, especially in the areas of narrative-type music, music which tells stories or evokes pictorial description.  Post-Romantic music went through a kind of bubble-and-crash, except around 1908 instead of 2008.  Inventiveness itself became a Value.  Entire new forms of music were developed (classical music stemmed, ultimately, from traditional dance and vocal forms).   These we tend to lump together as \"20th-Century music\", relegating everything previous to \"Classical.\"  Today we continue the lumping process, and label anything by dead composers or musicians that are more interested in making music ultimately musically interesting (as opposed to monetarily lucrative) as \"Classical\", as opposed to \"Pop.\"   However, the Boston Pops perform lots of music that younger folk today would call Classical.  Composers such as Gershwin or Duke Ellington, who used folk, ethnic and urban music and rhythms, are increasingly considered classical, as is the entire Jazz movement.  Generally - if they teach it in a course in college, it's \"Classical.\" To confound this further, there is a period generally called \"The Classic Period\", which describes Haydnmozartbeethoven.  (My professor, Karl Geiringer, used this as one word, pronouncing Haydn with a powerful \"khhhh\" at the start). ",

            "answer_text": "No. It has not. Not least because always is an extremely long time, and music hasn\u2019t existed for even a tiny fraction of it. English as a language has existed for a much shorter amount of time, and even within the period where an English that could be understood by contemporary speakers has been spoken, music has been referred to by its distinct uses. It\u2019s only recently that we have started to categorise music by genre, rather than by the use or function it was intended for by its creator. Church music, chamber music, concert music, symphony music (music you heard when you \u201cwent to the symphony\u201d, which is to say, went to hear your local band play at their concert hall whatever the programme might be), dance music (Strauss, Waldteufel, and before them, Haydn and Mozart all wrote music that was intended to be danced to). Those uses were the forerunners of our modern genres. When art music was being dragged bodily out of the big-C Classical period by Beethoven, Schubert, and their followers, the lovers of the new Romantic movement in music (and in other arts) referred to the previous styles of music (including everyone from Palestrina, Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, and Mozart) as \u2018classical,\u2019 by which they meant constrained by the rules and forms of that period. While Beethoven showed that there was life in those forms, and breaking some of the rules while observing others could open up new territory for expression, it took the rise of the nationalist movement in music to show that there was merit in folk music, in the traditions of specific peoples (gypsy-flavoured music; the craze for Turkish sonorities, and other \u2018Oriental\u2019 sounds; African rhythms; Indian ragas and the melodic freedom from equal temperament that allowed microtonality; and all the other crazes for music that had a national identity). Not much of that was classical at the time \u2014 but it has become so with distance, and recognition that the composers who drew inspiration from their own and other traditions were still writing for a specific performance tradition. And I think it\u2019s the performance style that matters now when we think of what we call classical music. Is it live? Is the audience singing along, or rapt, or following a score? Is it a recording intended for a movie? Is it solo, instrumental, vocal? Is it in a concert hall, a stadium, a palace, or in the open air? None of those is guaranteed to be (or not to be) true of a classical performance. But if the performance is a momentary capture of an interpretation of a piece, that\u2019s a big clue. I think we will continue to use the phrase \u201cclassical music\u201d to refer to music of which that is true (including some jazz), and which in addition is clearly intended for such transitory experience. Note that I don\u2019t mean by this that the performance is of unique music, such as would be the case for improvisations or where improvisation is an important component, but rather that the specific performance captures a moment, a conception, and a performer or performers who deliver a version that is the sum of those parts at that moment. Organists: bah. Organists are basically jazz wannabes ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "Since no one else has answered this, here goes:  The music of each era we know about since music has been written down, which has survived hundreds of years in some cases, was the popular music of that day.  Medieval music was not called by that name in the Medieval period - it was music.  The periods following that are now known as the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Impressionist, Neoclassical, and contemporary periods in hindsight.  Everything up to and including contemporary music is known collectively as \"Classical\" music to differentiate it from current \"popular\" music.  From Wikipedia page \"List of Classical Composers by Era\": Medieval\t(476\u20131400) Renaissance\t(1400\u20131600) Baroque\t(1600\u20131760) Classical era\t(1730\u20131820) Romantic era\t(1815\u20131910) 20th century\t(1900\u20132000) 21st century\t(since 2000) I personally think of Impressionism as a genre all its own, which would agree with another wiki page (\"Impressionism in Music\"): Impressiomist period   c. 1875 to 1925 Modern, High Modern c. 1890 - 1975 20th Century c. 1900-2000 Contemporary/post Modern c. 1975-present 21st Century c. 2000-present IMHO nothing changed abruptly in 2000.   The Contemporary/Post modern era includes many sub-genres like western atonalism, serialism, and minimalism, to name a few, and it isn't over.  200 years from now the important, lasting styles of the 20th and 21st centuries will have names and overlapping dates, too....I hope this answers your question.

Well, it would not be correct to call any piece written in the period from Bach to Prokofiew \"classical\". Because Bach is Baroque and Prokofiew - modern music. Classical music is music period  Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. And it is not really right to call everything other so. ",
