            "answer_text": "Baepsae is a song about BTS themselves. There are many meanings and interpretations made by ARMYs. I'll run you through what I thought, however, it could be another meaning that you end up liking. It's your choice. But let me start from the top. Baepsae is the name of a type of bird that\u2019s called \u2018crow-tit,\u2019 or a \u2018parrotbill.\u2019 So essentially, there's an idiom in Korean that refers to the \u2018baepsae\u2019 attempting to walk like a stork but then breaking its legs as it\u2019s legs are shorter than that of a stork. It represents that the baepsae, while attempting to be like the stork, only ruins itself while trying to imitate something/someone better. Simpler words: it\u2019s an idiom used for someone \"trying hard\" to achieve something or be better than someone else.  So, now, main topic. BTS are under the management of what once was a small company, compared to the Big 3: YG, SM and JYP. They are a younger generation, and they are told to work harder to harder to not suffer in the future, and also to \u2018ensure their success.\u2019 The Big 3 have no worries as to whether their groups will be a hit or not. Being such a successful entertainment agency, the groups already have a great life of not that much effort to put in. So unlike the \u2018upper class,\u2019 such as YG, JYP and SM, they have to work harder and put more effort. They exclaim that they are called as \u2018try-hards\u2019 by people, and that they're tired of being told to try harder and harder. They say that the artists who came before them want to keep their reign over the sales, and charts and the hearts of Koreans, and that the rules are all made of such standard that the younger generation is at a disadvantage, and that it isn't fair. They also say that they are blamed for not being to equalize with the groups who came before them, or be bigger than them, and answer with \u2018you must be kidding me.\u2019 That's all I remember, for now. I may keep updating it as I go. But I don't think there's much to it. I hope you got the gist of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone knows Baepsae as an upbeat, easy to get into the mood song but if we really dive deep into the lyrics, it\u2019s quite inspiring how BTS is breaking the status quo with this song. Baepsae is a bird in Korea translated as \u201cCrow Tit\u201d \u2014 I know, let\u2019s not judge the translation please, they look like very cute birds. Anyway, opposite a Crow Tit is a Stork. Crow Tits have short legs, Storks have long legs. In personification, Crow Tits are like those people in society who are middle class, \u201csilver spoons\u201d while Storks are those people in society who are high class, \u201cgold spoons\u201d. There are a lot more \u201cspoons\u201d in Korea that signify hierarchy but I will only mention these two because it\u2019s in the song. BTS sings about how Storks don\u2019t have to work as hard in getting to their destination because they have longer legs, they have this sort of \u201cprivilege\u201d by birth. When you\u2019re a born Crow Tit, you either make it into the industry by working hard or working hard. There is no other way in winning, there is only effort. The only thing you have is your talent and your passion to succeed, but in a corrupt society, hardwork doesn\u2019t always win. Storks, get the money, opportunity and networks since birth, they wake up to a life where they exert effort and their effort is already rewarded, it was a given already. This is what BTS is calling out in the society, the unfairness of the old generation saying that their hardwork will be repaid one day, as long as they work hard and exert effort. Lucky and blessed for BTS hardwork did work for them, but for some, hardwork isn\u2019t everything. Saying that the Big Company privilege is a lie is literally delusional, open your eyes to reality and realize that KPop is just another industry thriving off from the money of fandoms.  This answer took so long but I hope this helped. Been a bit busy with work and life lately, been a hiatus ARMY but still love BTS so much. My answer is mainly derived from Muish\u2019 interpretation. Please do visit her blog it\u2019s been very helpful in trying to understand BTS in a more cultural manner. ",
