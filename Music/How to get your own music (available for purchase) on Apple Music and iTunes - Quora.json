The best one in my experience has been DistroKid, but keep in mind you'll be charged a yearly rate for unlimited songs to be uploaded. The great things about using DK is that you will have fast support, your songs can be uploaded as fast as you like, you get pre-save links, your songs are submitted to a lot of different platforms you probably didn't even know about and the price is very affordable. Other platforms such as CDBaby and TuneCore charge you for every song, whether it's a monthly or yearly rate. Too expensive for beginning careers or any career really. There are a few ones that claim to be free and take a % of your royalties or that say they don't\u2026 but not very reliable. I've tested free ones and none of the benefits from DistroKid actually were there. ",
