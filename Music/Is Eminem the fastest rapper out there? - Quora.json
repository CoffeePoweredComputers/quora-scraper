            "answer_text": "Eminem is undeniably a fast rapper, as anything over 10 sps is fairly rapid and Eminem hits 12.3 syllables per second from my calculations on his fastest verse, being speedom, but this would not even put him close to being the fastest rapper alive. I won\u2019t mention people whose only goal is to go fast, like crucified or don xperto because they don\u2019t make music they just make noise, but here are some rappers that can rap faster than Eminem that have very accessible music, as well as the songs they reach their peaks, in increasing order Logic is just as fast as Eminem, hitting 12.3 sps on his one-off, live-oriented verse, titled \u201cJack the Ripper,\u201d though logic holds the speed for around 6 seconds as opposed to Eminem\u2019s roughly 1.5 second burst Joyner Lucas - peak of 12.4 sps on the song \u201cSriracha,\u201d other fast songs are his \u201cPanda\u201d remix on which he goes 10.3 sps, and his \u201cMask Off\u201d remix, where he goes 10.1 sps Tech N9ne - peak of 12.7 sps on \u201cWelcome To The Midwest,\u201d other fast songs are \u201cTaking Online Orders\u201d on which he goes 11.7 sps, \u201cKill Shit\u201d where he goes 10.7 sps, and \u201cGet Off Me\u201d where he goes 11.8 sps Busta Rhymes - peak of 12.8 sps on the song \u201cHello,\u201d other fast songs are \u201c60 Second Assassins\u201d where i calculated 11.8 sps and \u201cWhy Stop Now\u201d where i calculated 10.5 sps Twista - peak of 12.8 sps on the song \u201cVictory or Death,\u201d other fast songs are \u201c60 Second Assassins\u201d in which he goes 11.5 sps, and \u201cMista Tung Twista\u201d, where he goes 11.2 sps KAAN - peak of 13 sps on \u201cNCS,\u201d other fast songs are \u201cRick Rolled\u201d on which he goes 11 sps and \u201cThe Dude\u201d where he goes 11.5 sps Token - Peak of 13 sps on \u201cSelf Taught,\u201d though i haven\u2019t calculated any other fast Token verses in terms of peak, probably his fastest over a long period of time is Doozy, where he spits around 165 syllables in 16 seconds, 8 syllables more in same amount of time as Rap God Tonedeff - 14 sps on \u201cCrispy,\u201d I\u2019m unaware of any of the numbers on his other songs though on the song \u201cDemon\u201d he spits 165 syllables in in 16 seconds, the same speed as token on doozy and 8 syllables more than Rap God in the same amount of time And Finally, Twisted Insane - at a whopping 15.6 sps on the song \u201cDome Split,\u201d other fast songs are \u201c100 Round Clip,\u201d where he goes around 14.1 sps, and \u201cBrainsick 1.0\u201d where he goes around 15 sps. Another sidenote is on the song \u201c100 Round Clip,\u201d he spits 161 syllables in 16 seconds, faster than Rap God, and averages 10 sps over 50 seconds on the first verse of the Chop Shop, as compared to Rap God on which he only averages 9.6 over 16 seconds. There are others that go faster than these, but these are just a few who make good content and I enjoy. Even then I think only about 3 or 4 out of these 9 rappers can compete with Eminem lyrically (KAAN, Logic, Tech N9ne, and Joyner specifically), and Eminem definitely can rap fast, but he\u2019s nowhere near the peak of some other rappers.
