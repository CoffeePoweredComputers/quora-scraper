            "answer_text": "From the start Elton was an unlikely star. He really didn\u2019t look the part of a rock star. Elton has always been some kind of prodigy on piano and has the amazing ability to take lyrics and immediately put them to music. I can think of no other artist that does this as well as Elton. On top of that he has an amazing voice and can really relate to the audience. No matter how messed up his life has been he rarely let it affect his performance. Elton has a love for music and it shows because he always gives you everything he has and has managed to stay fairly grounded as a person. He always tries to remain current and shakes off negativity and the best example of this is when he performed with Eminem, there was a lot of controversy surrounding this and Elton turned it into a positive and gave us a great moment in music history. He cares about the music and cares about the fans and truly appreciates the success that he has had so that is why he has remained a success in the music business. ",

And that is only one aspect to Elton John's life long enduring success. The \u201cexperts\"weigh in.. and Elton John on himself.. \u2018the success of Elton John' Why Elton John Remains so Successful How important was Bernie Taupin to the success of Elton John's music? Elton John inspired to succeed by 'uncaring dad' I always wanted my dad to hug me and tell me he loved me. He didn't but he loved me in his own way. I now think that maybe my relationship with my dad, which I spent so many years being angry about, is the thing that actually made me successful. ",
