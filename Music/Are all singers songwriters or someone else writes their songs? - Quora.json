            "answer_text": "Is it a hard and fast rule? No. It's not even a guideline.  Songwriting depends upon the person who is the creative mind behind lyrics. This is not restricted to any specific person in a band. I'll provide a few examples. In Black Sabbath, Geezer Butler (Bass) wrote the lyrics based on Tony Iommi's (Guitar) riffs, or vice versa, and handed them over to singer Ozzy Osbourne. In Lamb of God, once the instrumentals are done, the track is handed over to Randy Blythe (singer), who then writes the lyrics. These two examples would answer your question. As an added example, to imply that songwriting isn't restricted to a SINGLE person, I would quote Metallica (St. Anger onwards). While creating the St. Anger album, ALL band members contributed to the writing process, not just the singer or drummer, etc.  What I have spoken about above is just based on my knowledge of Heavy Metal music. With reference to any other genre or individual singers, they probably do write the lyrics themselves, or have writers that help them out (I think Beyonc\u00e9 uses writers). Cheers. ",

Like \u201cAa Chal ke tujhe main lae ke chalu\u2026\u201d Ravindra Jain also used to write lyrics that he sang. These days, I can quote Vishal Dadlani, who wrote one or two songs for him. Cant remember any other singers who penned their own song. There are however composers / singers who composed and sang some numbers by themselves like Hemant Kumar in the yesteryears and A R Rehaman, Vishal Dadlani of the present days. However, there are lots of western Singers who sang the song of their own lyrics. John lenon, Paul Mccartney, George Harisson and even Ringo Star, all from the Beatles penned lyrics that were sung by themselves as well. Eric Clapton, Elvis Presley, John Denver as well to name a few wrote the lyrics of many of their own songs. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is no, not all singers write their own songs. But it really depends on what genre you\u2019re asking about. For most pop and radio-friendly music you hear, the majority of those artists do not write their own songs because there\u2019s a formula behind it and the procuders/labels want to capitalize on that (\u2026it\u2019s amazing how some of this music has 6 writers for 3 lines and several producers for a song that hardly has any real instruments\u2026ok, ok, off my soap box!). There are some exceptions, however. When you get into genres such as heavy metal, the band usual has one or two writers for their songs. Rarely will you find someone outside the band writing for them. ",

Beyonce - Run the World (Girls) - 6 songwriters, 4 producers Justin Bieber - Sorry - 5 songwriters, 2 producers Record companies and stars pay a lot of good money for the songs they get to perform, so not acknowledging the other songwriters doesn\u2019t really bother me all that much. Personally, I like how country music handles the songwriter situation. If you ever watch a country music award show, the artist will almost always thank the songwriter during their speech and sometimes the songwriter even goes up on stage. Again, not necessary, but I think it\u2019s a nice thing to do. ",

There are definitely those who do (Sia, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars), but a lot of times, a singer may ask another writer to make her a song (the most popular go-to for this is Sia). If they tell Sia their vision, they might get a credit. A lot of them are simply asked to just put vocals on a song. Sometimes, the direction that they want for their music may not even be the one that they want for their career, and is dictated by their image or their label. ",

After all, the most important thing for them is to sing well, either their own songs or others\u2019. Of course, there are some singers who can write lyrics or composition or even both. They get inspiration from daily life and write it down to create their own songs. But this kind of crackerjack singers is unusual actually. ",
