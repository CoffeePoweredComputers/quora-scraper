            "answer_text": "As someone who has used YouTube pretty much since inception and having the benefit of having been part of 3 different demographics (child, teenager, young adult) during that time, I think I have a fair grasp of why this is the case. You see, when someone subscribes, they do it for a number of reasons depending on their demographic. To give a few examples:  A child subscribes because of the 'wow' factor.A teenager subscribes to be a part of a relatable community.A young adult subscribes because they find the content to be satisfactory.And so many more reasons!Eventually, especially during the ages of 10 - 25, your opinion changes DRASTICALLY and SUDDENLY. One moment you like PewDiePie because he is super random and funny, the next you hate him because he is way too popular, then you like him again because you've grown up with him in a manner of speaking. Having been through similar phases to this with over 200 channels, I can definitely say that this creates a heavily dynamic audience that can and will change without a content creators consent.  Another interesting thing to note is that a lot of people probably don't know how to unsubscribe! It's pretty simple, but a lot of people will forget and due to interface changes over the years, don't know where to do it! (Trust me, I went 3 years without knowing how to unsubscribe.) TLDR; Audience Size =/ Audience Retention. Just because PewDiePie has 40 million subscribers does not mean he has 40 million viewers, merely 38 million lazy people + 2 million active audience members. ",

            "answer_text": "Well let's extrapolate this out into a real world example. You subscribe and pay to cable television as well as say 3 premium channels along with Netflix and Hulu. Do you watch every show on HBO? How about ABC?  it's the same thing as PewDiePie. His is a channel the same way Discovery is a channel. The people who enjoy \"Ice Road Truckers\" may very well not enjoy \"American Pickers\" You are mistaking correlation for causation.  Just because I click subscribe doesn't mean I will watch every video, but it DOES mean I will be notified of said video when its uploaded. It's a convenience of YouTube to let the viewers know that a channel has updated, nothing more, nothing less. Sure it's more than a simple vanity metric as there is math to determine the average engagement of subscriber by sample and you can A/B test that to increase conversion, but it is just a guideline for success. TL:DR Not everyone watches every show made, even when they pay for them. ",
