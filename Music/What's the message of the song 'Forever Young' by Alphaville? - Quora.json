            "answer_text": "The song is an unusual mix of fatalism and Carpe Diem. Consider also when it was released (1984) and the heightened tensions between the USA and the former USSR at that time. An early verse mentions watching the skies and The Bomb (i.e. the threat of nuclear war), and a sense that we could all die at any moment due to the actions of those in power. The song states that instead of being sad about this we should make the most of our lives, party all we can today because there may not be a tomorrow. Prince expressed a similar sentiment in his song '1999\u2032. The 'forever young' theme is obvious if you think about it. Many people would die in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear conflict; they would never get the chance to become old, they would be forever the age they were at the outbreak of war. \u2026Forever in this case being the rest of their curtailed lives. The video features raggedy dressed adults and children waking from a sleep in a ruined church. At the end they pass through a diamond portal towards a bright, heavenly light. The more ecclesiastical listener might interpret the video as a reminder that when people ascend to heaven, people remain in / return to a youthful state. They would be like this forever. \u2026But I don't think this was the intention of the band.  ",
