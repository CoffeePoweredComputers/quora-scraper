            "answer_text": "Of course that depends upon what you're hearing.  But the ability to listen is a true skill and a gift.  However, one must learn to discern what they're hearing.  If you find you are listening to someone else's neurosis, or egocentric rambling, you have the right to deviate from being victimized.  Some things are simply not worth listening to, and enabling another by agreeing to endure is not helping anyone.  It just gives them more confidence for the next victim they corner. If someone is trying to convince you of something to supersede your own feelings and convictions, again, they do not deserve the time.  They are overstepping their boundaries.  But speaking of one's beliefs is not the same as forcefully pushing them. One can detect when there is lack of respect on the part of the one speaking. One can learn to detect the intention of one who is speaking and get a feel for the degree of honesty and sincerity.  This is an important ability. Listening is a sign of receptivity, openness, and willingness to take in something other than the plethora of your own mind.  This is a sign of wisdom, and your inherent understanding of your connectedness to all of life.  Life gives us many messages through even the simplest words of others, sounds of nature and all else our ears can detect.  To learn to listen to life and take note consciously of applicable meaning to one's own life and being is called being a good 'tracker'.  It is a very beneficial ability.   Listening to life, listening to nature, listening to what others really mean in their words, listening to your body, listening to your heart and mind are a requirement for progression.  It is the opening of one's inner arms.  It is the art of going beyond oneself.  Some are graceful in this art, others, have a great deal to learn, as they are more interested in being heard.  This is one of the issues that one must be able to detect and cease to enable. Listening within silence connects one to their universal self. What you can learn by honing the art of listening is strength of character, and a sign of wisdom and maturity.   It is a flower fully blossomed to receive the sun.  A thing of beauty. Truly, we all are like a unique song yearning to be heard.   ",
