So how do you get around Instagram\u2019s limited functionality to post longer videos? There are a few methods for getting your longer videos up on Instagram where they belong! Without wasting any more time, let\u2019s take a look at how to post longer videos on Instagram. Method One: Multiple Clips The most straightforward way to get around this is to simply post your video in increments. Choose the \u2018Select Multiple\u2019 option. Let\u2019s say you have a 1-minute video that you\u2019d like to add to your Instagram story, but can\u2019t because it\u2019s exactly 45 seconds too long. When you select that video for sharing, it will be automatically trimmed down to the first 15 seconds. If you don\u2019t want to butcher your video, you\u2019ll want to do a little editing of your own before uploading it to Stories. Use your phone\u2019s video editing features to trim the video into 15 seconds increments. Soon you\u2019ll have your 1-minute video trimmed to four 15-second clips, which you can easily upload to Instagram. Next, it\u2019s time to share that series of clips on Instagram. Do this the old-fashioned way instead of directly to Stories to make sure the clips are in the right order. Here\u2019s how to post a clip to Instagram: Tap the \u2018+\u2019 to add images and videos from your camera roll.Tap on the option to add several pieces of content together.Select the clips you want in order.Tap Next.Edit clips to your preference.Tap Next.Add a caption and location.Tap Share.
