            "answer_text": "Hell no. Have you ever heard the phrase, \u201cToo big to fail?\u201d Elvis gained his fame and his \u201cKing of Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u2019 crown in the 50s. His career survived the British Invasion, the Psychedelic Era, Folk Rock, Heavy Metal, and the onslaught of Disco. He was still selling out arenas in 1976 and died at the age of 42 in 1977. Unlike the way-too-many rock stars that burned brightly and crashed by 27. Had Elvis stayed healthy, he very well could have had a very long successful career. Consider the Rolling Stones selling out stadiums all over the world. Mick Jagger is 75! And just a week or so ago I saw the legendary jazz star Tony Bennett wow a packed house (with tickets ranging from $80 to over $200.) Hardly a \u201chas-been\u201d at the remarkable age of 92. On the other hand, had Elvis not overdosed on drugs\u2014and simply didn\u2019t give a shit anymore\u2014yeah, he could have thrown his career away, popping up once in a while to pay the bills to support his lifestyle. But the music business, for artists, really began to take shape in the 70s AS A BUSINESS and stars such as him eventually get proper counseling, management, and marketing expertise to protect their images and grow their value in the marketplace. In other words, smart people know how maintain fame and build wealth. As much as I didn\u2019t care for the 70s Vegas jump-suited Elvis (at the time it was NOT COOL for rebellious rock \u2019n rollers to be playing VEGAS), he was actually kind of a pioneer. ALL of the huge stars of today play Vegas and many set up \u201cresidencies\u201d in which they\u2019ll play a venue there for a month or more. Think about that! Further, Elvis never toured internationally. Never did concerts outside of the USA. The opportunities for him in Europe, Asia, and South America would have been incredible. Factor in the fact that Elvis was PASSIONATE about music and you could actually see him navigating the waters of the modern music business. ",

            "answer_text": "If he were still alive today he would have been 83 years old. He would have retired. He would have been by nature physically unable to be still performing at 83. I do believe he would still have been a legend. I don t think his iconic status has to do with his untimely passing. His career was in decline for at least a decade before he died due to his drug addiction, his bad physical condition and poor career choices, merely for the sake of cash. He was already overshadowed by the Beatles but had he decided to make drastic changes such as fire Colonel Parker, tour extensively abroad and not only in the USA, take part in a good movie and release an album with a more update sound, no doubt he would have rebuilt his career. He was too talented not to have been able to make a great comeback. But Elvis was depressed, hooked on drugs and enabled. He was not healthy or fit. He needed to rest and clean up. He needed to fight his demons. He had the talent, the looks even at 42 but not the strength or the willpower to change his life. Frankly, he feared himself he might end up washed up and become a has been. \u201c Will people still remember me after i am gone\u201d he asked a nurse when he on rehab. He was depressed, no doubt about that. What would have happened had he lived we will never really know. Even if he never sold another record, gave another concert, played in another movie or even ended up homeless in the streets, as his finances were in dire straits by the time he died, it would have been betteras long as he had lived. As is almost always the case with super stars he died too young and his death cleared up his finances. ",
