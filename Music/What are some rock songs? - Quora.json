            "answer_text": "This is a really open question, I\u2019m gonna try my best to cover a bunch of subgenres and decades (I have a really rusty English as well). We can start with Elvis, some iconic songs are \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d, \u201cHound Dog\u201d, \u201cLove me Tender\u201d. Surf Rock developed through the 50\u2019s, one of the most important groups from tat genre is the Beach Boys. \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d, \u201cSurfin\u2019 USA\u201d. \u201cHit the Road, Jack\u201d is an emblematic soul song made famous by Ray Charles. The Animals\u2019 music is important to understand this agressive tone that developed through the 60\u2019s that would later turn into the counterculture movement led by The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles (In a more \u201cpop\u201d way). \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d, \u201cBlack Dog\u201d, \u201cSatisfaction\u201d, \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d, \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d. If you\u2019re interested in focusing on the way guitar playing developed through Rock eras, going through all those artists is important, as the Guitar Hero concept came with the 60\u2019s counterculture movement. Jimmy Hendrix, Jimmy Page , Angus Young (AC/DC \u201cRiff Raff\u201d, \u201cThunderstruck\u201d, \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d, \u201cLet there be rock\u201d) would then turn into Joe Satriani, Frank Zappa, Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Paul Gilbert, etc etc etc. Pink Floyd came with psychedelic Rock and HUGE productions (its theatrical ways have their roots in artists like David Bowie), \u201cComfortably numb\u201d, \u201cMoney\u201d, \u201cHey you\u201d, \u201cAnother brick in te wall\u201d. I would suggest hearing Glam Rock and Metal as well, with KISS \u201cRock and Roll all night\u201d, \u201cHeaven\u2019s on fire\u201d, as well as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Bon Jovi, etc. Some Prog Rock bands are Yes (\u201cOwner of a Lonely Heart\u201d), Toto (\u201cAfrica\u201d, \u201cHold the line\u201d), Rush (\u201cYYZ\u201d). Metal music comes in a lot of flavors, I personally started as lots of kids with Metallica and Megadeth, which means I listened to a lot of Thrash Metal from the 80\u2019s, (\u201cHit the Lights\u201d, \u201cThe Mechanix or The four horsemen\u201d, \u201cOne\u201d, \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d, \u201cMetal Militia\u201d, \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d), listening to Black Sabbath and Diamond Head will show you some of their influences. you can also check on Dream Theater (Prog Metal), Testament, Warrant, Mr. Big, Extreme (Funk Rock, as well as other genres) etc etc etc. Brit Rock also derived in bands like Arctic Monkeys (\u201cBet you look good on the dancefloor\u201d, \u201cDancing Shoes\u201d). Oasis (\u201cWonderwall\u201d, \u201cStop crying your heart out\u201d) , The Strokes, The Kooks. I forgot Deep Purple, which combined orchestral music, jazz, blues and rock (\u201cSmoke on the water\u201d, \u201cWhen a blind mand cries\u201d, \u201cHighway star\u201d, and a thousand songs more). Queen\u2026 man, Queen, no comments, just listen to them (\u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d, \u201cTie your mother down\u201d, \u201cOgre Battle\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop me Now\u201d, \u201cOne Vision\u201d, \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love\u201d) Man, I could keep on mentioning bands and songs, and I\u2019m sure I forgot lots of iconic rock artists and bands, I have played guitar for 11 years now. One of my favorite bands is Mr. Big by the way (\u201cDaddy, Brother, Lover, Little boy\u201d, \u201cTake a walk\u201d, \u201cRock and Roll over\u201d). As you can see Rock music is more than just a genre. Finally, as a mexican I can suggest you hear Caifanes, Caf\u00e9 Tacuba, Agora, Man\u00e1, Jaguares, El Tri. And lots of other artists that adopted Rock music as a way of expression. I wish you luck in this amazing journey (THE WHO, LISTEN TO THE WHO) that is Rock Music. ",
