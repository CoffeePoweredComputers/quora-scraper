            "answer_text": "This question is based on opinion. In order to keep this answer fair, I will not list my preference, nor will I take sides. I will, however, have an opinion on what makes each of the uniquely attractive. Please also take note that quite a few Armys probably think another member entirely is more handsome so you can\u2019t really say V and Jin are the \u2018best\u2019 visuals but I\u2019\u2019ll only be comparing them since they are the only two you asked about. First of all. Jin is the main visual of BTS. Not opinion wise - it is genuinely one of his roles as a group member. V is also a visual, although not main visual. Jin  You also can\u2019t talk about Jin\u2019s visuals without talking about his lips. Jin has very full lips which is definitly one of the main points in his looks. He also has a generally round face which surprisingly suits his face since it is normally good for a male idol to have a sharp jawline whereas Jin pulls off a round face perfectly. Although this isn\u2019t a part of his physical visuals, I would also add that the confidence he shows on camera adds to his attractiveness. He flaunts his \u2018handsomeness\u2019 for us all to see, showing us his attractive sides and making Armys fangirl/boy over him like crazy. One reason to why some people prefer other visuals is because he has quite full features and a round face, he is sometimes seen as having a \u2018baby face\u2019. Although I personally disagree with this, many people - online and in person - have told me it is a reason to why they prefer other members\u2019 visuals. They tend to prefer someone who looks more manly. Most people who are into kpop like men with sharp jawlines, abs, slim face and sharp features since it is an ideal type for a lot of cultures. V  V, on the other hand, has sharper features. One thing that makes him visually pleasing is his long, defined nose and his soft eyes. In my opinion, they are his \u2018most charming points\u2019 and are usually what attract other people as well. His overall face shape is quite thin and he also has quite feminine features but manages to pull of a \u2018manly look\u2019. Complaints I\u2019ve heard about Taehyung\u2019s visuals are that his features are too feminine and that he looks like a girl. I\u2019m used to people saying this but it happens especially with V of BTS. However, his personality and voice are quite different and can be described as \u2018manly\u2019. To be honest, I don\u2019t like it when people say a certain person has to look \u2018manly\u2019 or \u2018feminine\u2019 to be their type. I was 11 when I first got into kpop and hadn\u2019t yet gone through puberty so I never understood it when people said they were so handsome or pretty - they weren\u2019t any different to what someone would describe as \u2018average\u2019 to me at the time. I didn\u2019t understand when someone compared visuals. I was just like \u2018but they both sing/rap good, they both dance very good, have funny personalities and both change their hair every second week of the month. What\u2019s the big difference?\u2019 I later understood (due to hormones and a whole load of crazy fans) but it is still something I dislike comparing in kpop. In order to keep this answer neutral, I will not be saying who I think is the better visual. I would say that Jin is the \u2018handsome rich guy\u2019 type and V is the \u2018flower boy next door\u2019 type. Their visuals are both unique and different. But in the end, it boils down to other people\u2019s opinions. So sorry, I can\u2019t answer your question but provided you with a bunch of uneccesary information anyway. Hope my answer helps! :) (Which it probably wont) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, beauty itself is very subjective and also depending on the age of the people. Just share my own experience\u2026I m in 30s and was NEVER into any kpop as I dont find femain boys and flower boys attractive at all. I didn't know BTS and know each of their face until 1 month ago when I first checked out the MV of On. Okay back to the topic. 2 years ago V was awarded the most handsome man in the world, beating down the well known manly Hollywood stars. When I looked at V as the winner I was like WTF? Then a month ago, I started to check out BTS to see why they are so internationally famous.. I checked out ON, finding the song good with powerful dance. Then I checked out Black Swan, Fake Love, DNA those popular songs which appeared on my YT recommendation list. At first I couldn't differentiate them but one did leave me the most impression. He is Jin. I found him quite attractive so I unintentionally remembered his handsome face. These days, I checked out more and more about BTS and each member. I am not and will not be ARMY but I would say I am a little fan of BTS but big fan of Jin. When I get to know more, Jin handsome face is no joke and he can carry all styles, different hair color, elegant and super casual because of his natural beauty and fundamental quality. More importantly he looks the same with and without makeup! Sorry as I said I didn't find kpop attractive because I prefer more natural style. And of course I love him more because of his sense of humor, mother-like caring, his underrated voice, hardworking etc. But here we only talk about visual. To be honest, V is my second love as I am a Taejin shipper! I find him quite handsome as he has an outstanding eyes and nose which stands out from the rest. Even Jin doesn't have that high nose. And V has a charisma of being cool and cute. Plus his deep voice.. His voice is the most distinguishable among all members and amazing stage presence and performance\u2026I think that's why people love V. I guess younger girls prefer V and 30s generation prefers Jin.. Just my opinion. And let's talk about some facts. Jin is the main visual of BTS as everyone knows. He was scouted by 2 agencies on the street. BH scouted him when he was exiting the bus\u2026.he had no singing and dancing experience like others but was still chosen as BTS member. His visual is no kidding right? And V too. He was convinced to audition when he accompanied his friend for audition and ended up being the only successful one in his district on that day. Even BTS went on debut on 2013 but didn't gain much fame even in Korea. In the Korean Melon Awards in 2015, Jin attracted so much attention by the media and Korean just by stepping out of the car. So he\u2019s called Car Door Guy. And in 2017 when they first appeared in BBMA, again, with his handsomeness, he was soon spotted and made himself stand out from the team and known as The third guy from the left. These are all out of natural and first impression and I am very happy Jin is well recognized for his good looking! All in all, I would definitely vote Jin for being the most handsome and worth to the main visual in BTS! ",
