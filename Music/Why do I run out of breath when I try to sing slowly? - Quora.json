            "answer_text": "It's not really the tempo of the piece, it's the length of the phrases. Everyone ultimately runs out of breath when they sing long slow phrases, because your body needs a certain amount of oxygen per second, and when you go a longer time without inhaling, you increase the amount of time that your body is going without a fresh dose of oxygen. Having said that, there are things you can do. If you are \"wasting\" breath, you will run out a lot faster than a more trained singer will do. This can manifest as a \"breathy\" sound, or just sound over sung. A vocal coach or teacher can show you techniques for economising and regulating your breath. It's a bit \"hands on\" and complicated for a Quora answer. Also, singing regularly improves lung capacity, so if you practice AND learn proper technique you can attack the problem from both ends. The other thing you can do is learn to take a catch breath (if you're singing solo) or stagger breathing if you are in a choir. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t know how to regulate and use your breath. Listen carefully to an opera singer. With training you\u2019ll be able to extend or hold a note much longer than you\u2019re able to do now, and with better timbre or quality of tone. More than the speed at which you sing, it\u2019s also the way you use diaphragm, lungs, and vocal cords with each breath. ",
