            "answer_text": "The most depressing song I\u2019ve ever heard? It\u2019s gotta be \u2018Father and Son\u2019 by Cat Stevens. This song is a story in itself, it consists of both sides of the story, while the \u201cSon\u201d verses are talking about how he can\u2019t stop thinking about all his problems, whilst the \u201cFather\u201d verses talk about how you need to take things easy and let go of your problems once in a while. This song mainly focuses on Cat\u2019s loss of relations with not only his father but also society. He said that \u2018father and son\u2019 seems to say everything he wanted to say, and he can\u2019t go on saying it cause you can only say it once it has to do with feeling frustrated, and it\u2019s to do with family and trying to get through to your family as well as trying to get through to society and school. Here are a few quotes from this song: \u201cIt's not time to make a changeJust sit down, take it slowlyYou're still young, that's your faultThere's so much you have to go through\u201d\u201cBut take your time, think a lotWhy think of everything you've got\nFor you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not\u201d\u201cAll the times that I've cried, keeping all the things I knewInsideIt's hard, but it's harder to ignore it\u201dThere\u2019s just a few lyrics from the song that makes me think a lot about life, death and why humans deal with/process problems the way we do. I strongly encourage you to give this one a listen, it\u2019s a great track. ",

            "answer_text": "How do You Sleep by John Lennon A completely hateful, spiteful, poisonous, venomous tirade against his best friend, former bandmate, and second half of the greatest songwriting team known Lennon and McCartney, Paul McCartney. Why is it depressing you might ask? Because it shows just how low John could sink to hurt one of the only two people to love him unconditionally. In fact all of these years later Paul still makes excuses for any of John's bad or anti social behavior. John knew where people's jugular veins were and didn't hesitate to go for them. Most especially those who loved him and he loved most.  Paul McCartney, Pryamus and John Lennon, Thisbe in a scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. ",
