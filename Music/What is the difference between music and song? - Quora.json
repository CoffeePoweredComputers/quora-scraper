It could be a song, a rap, a jig, a march, a symphony, a scat, etc. All of these things are forms of music. The people who play rhythms on buckets and cans outside many concerts are performing music, but they\u2019re not necessarily playing a song. The orchestra performing a symphony is playing music, but not a song. The singer/guitarist in the local coffee house is playing a song, which is also music. But it\u2019s a specific form of music. ",
