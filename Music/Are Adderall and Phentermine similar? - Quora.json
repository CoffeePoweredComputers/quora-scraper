Drug testing for amphetamines Amphetamines describe the category, or drug class, that includes both amphetamine and methamphetamine. While the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) requirements include MDMA under the group \u201camphetamines,\u201d laboratory testing typically requires a separate, specific test. Amphetamines are central nervous system stimulants that cause a reaction of increased energy and alertness and then exhaustion as the effects wear off. Excessive and long-term use can produce physical effects such as disorientation, severe depression, paranoia, hallucinations, increased blood pressure and fatigue. Amphetamine and methamphetamine may be mistaken as the same drug, but they are not. Below is some information specific to each unique drug. Amphetamine is a stimulant and an appetite suppressant that stimulates the central nervous system by increasing the release of certain chemicals (\u201cneurotransmitters\u201d) in the brain. It is a Schedule II drug that can be prescribed for the treatment of narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Physical symptoms can include restlessness, tremors, rapid breathing, confusion, panic and seizures. Because of the potential for abuse and addiction, physicians prefer using other treatment methods. Common trade names of amphetamine-containing drugs are Adderall\u00ae, Dexedrine\u00ae and Vyvanse\u00ae.Methamphetamine, sometimes called meth, crystal, crank and ice, is an extremely addictive stimulant drug. It can be taken orally, smoked, snorted, or dissolved in water or alcohol and injected. According to the National Institue on Frug Abuse even small amounts of methamphetamine can cause increased physical activity, decreased appetite, increased respiration, rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeat and increased blood pressure. Repeated methamphetamine use may lead to anxiety, insomnia, weight loss, skin sores, severe dental problems (referred to as \u201cmeth mouth\u201d) and addiction.",

            "answer_text": "They act on the same neurotransmitters, but at different rates. Adderall focuses more on relaxing the body and releasing energy at the same time so it increases focus. It\u2019s like you have this surge of energy in the body but you are not anxious or too excited due to the effects of dopamine. You lose weight because Adderall helps release stored energy. On the other hand, Phentermine focuses more on the digestive tract. It makes you feel full, and it also releases energy and you lose weight fast because you have a surge of energy in the body and you don\u2019t feel hungry. They are kinds similar in that way that you feel energetic after taking either. Yet, your doctor should decide which one you should take given your purpose. ",
