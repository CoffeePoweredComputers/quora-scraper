Still let's say you became a trainee now, if you debuted 4 years later, you'd still be young (20), so I wouldn't say you're too old per se. As I'm sure you know, K idols start pretty freaking young. But maybe, if you're talented and check off all the things YG is looking for, you could still become an idol and could possibly debut faster, which would allow you to still be young \u2014 so to speak \u2014 when you debut. That's a lot of maybe though, so be prepared to bring your A game. ",
