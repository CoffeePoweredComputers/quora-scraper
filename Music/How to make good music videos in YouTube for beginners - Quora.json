            "answer_text": "There are plenty of ways to make a music video on a budget. First, you\u2019ll need a camera. Any iPhone would work just fine, but if you have a DSLR, mirrorless, or even better camera than those that will work as well. Get creative. Not every music video has to be glamorous with mansions, nice cars, etc. Tell the story of your music. It could be shots of you singing/rapping/playing (whatever you/your band does), it could be B-Roll of a scene that portrays the mood of your video. To make it look like a \u201creal\u201d music video, take it into a software like Adobe Premiere Pro (industry standard editing software, final cut pro works too), color correct the shots you took (to your liking), and use the \u201ccrop\u201d effect to add black bars to the bottom and top of your music video to appear widescreen, when it\u2019s really not. You can stabilize shots that are shaky with the warp stabilizer effect, just make sure to plan what shots you want stabilized, and film them as stable as possible during the shoot. Keep your audience in mind. It\u2019s not as much about what scene you\u2019re in, or the budget of the video, it\u2019s about the artist. If the artist has a personality that the public enjoys watching, you will succeed. Too many times I see people fall flat of the persona/uniqueness but still shell out the budget, and it results in an aesthetically pleasing, yet disappointing turnout. Be original, be yourself, and take shots at angles nobody has came up with before. Then, you will catch attention. ",
