            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to write about this because I think Jimi Hendrix is a very misunderstood phenomenon. Jimi was a good guitar player. Fine. There were and are a lot of very good guitar players. Even in the mid-late 1960s, I saw live guitarists that I thought were better guitar players than Hendrix. Their names have disappeared in history. The case I\u2019d want to make is that it was not Hendrix\u2019 guitar playing skill that set him so vastly apart from the ordinary. One of the most common misunderstandings I see in discussions of Hendrix is that any of us can go on You Tube and find instructions on how to play like Jimi. Stevie Ray Vaughn is often cited as being a master of the Hendrix style, which he was. But Stevie did not \u201cinvent\u201d the Hendrix style with nothing more to work with than a blank page. Jimi was an innovator. This is a quantum leap beyond being a good guitar player. Few of the techniques and styles Jimi used in his playing had ever been used or heard before he appeared on the scene. He had influences in electric blues, but beyond that, everything else came right straight out of his head. Or maybe somewhere else, who knows. Sure, you can become a Hendrix imitator and even become a very good Hendrix imitator. But there\u2019s nothing on You Tube or anywhere else that can teach you how to become a revolutionary innovator that will change everything about how an instrument will be used and perceived and have a lasting impact on those changes. Aside from being a very good guitarist, here are the two things that stand out for me: One was how drastic the stylistic changes in guitar became as a result of Hendrix. Secondly, is the far reaching, long lasting impact of those innovative changes. Stepping out of the musical realm for a few examples: Did you know, or would you even believe that, prior to Hendrix, the Fender Stratocaster was considered among guitarists to be a grossly inferior instrument? Yes. The whammy bar was a mess, the tone was thin and very hard to work with for rock music, and the pickups buzzed like crazy. Nearly all of the emerging guitarists at the time were using Les Paul\u2019s or Gibson hollow bodies. The least remarkable high profile Stratocaster artist at the time, was Al Jardine of The Beach Boys, and Al wasn\u2019t doing much with it. With Al as a contemporary role model, it was assumed that his was the representation of what a Stratocaster was used for. Not much, just a subordinate role. Between Al Jardine and the disaster that was the Stratocaster design, it just didn\u2019t cut it. After Hendrix, sales of Fender Stratocasters exploded so drastically that Fender had no way of keeping up with the demand. If you were a retail dealer in the early to mid 1970s, you were required to purchase twelve non-Stratocaster Fender products in order to be entitled to purchase just one Fender Stratocaster. No guitarist, ever \u2026 none \u2026 has had that kind of impact on the MI market. Prior to Hendrix, my best band buddy and I visited a local music store where the salesman wanted us to try out a Vox Wha Wha pedal, which we did. Our impression was, \u201cAh, OK. That\u2019s nice, but what in the world would you do with it?\u201d We both knew how to play, but neither of us had the forward thinking, visionary musical insight of Hendrix. So we just passed it up. Need I tell you how surprised and humbled we were when we started hearing Clapton and Hendrix show the world what could be done with a Wha-Wha pedal? Cue laugh track, please. Here again, Hendrix started from nothing but a blank page and an accessory pedal. Countless guitar heroes of the 1970\u2019s through recent decades have attributed their inspiration and greatest musical influence to Hendrix. The Stevie Rays and the Robin Trowers of the world did a nice job of imitating the Hendrix style and giving it a little more polish and refinement. But they didn\u2019t invent it, nor did they transform everything we thought we knew about guitar into something entirely different that would have a permanent impact on how the electric guitar is used and perceived. Hendrix described himself as a \u201cmessenger\u201d and wrote a lot of song lyrics about angels. Whatever the source of his transformative innovation, he was describing the feature of something that comes from outside of the realm of our ordinary experience of just being a proficient guitar player. In retrospect, I sincerely believe that Hendrix was a revolutionary, transformative pop music phenomenon that went far beyond being merely good as a player. I hope that makes sense to readers. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Jimi Hendrix isn\u2019t objectively the best guitarist or the guitarist you would always want to listen. He notes weren\u2019t always perfect, meaning he was sloppy. Neither he had that much of emotions in his songs or was very fast. He isn\u2019t liked by many artists. Joe Pass didn\u2019t like him. Marty Friedman himself doesn\u2019t like him. He said, \u201cI\u2019D \u2018RATHER CHEW GLASS\u2019 THAN LISTEN TO JIMI HENDRIX\u201d But the reason he is being considered the greatest guitarist of all time because of the influence, style, creativity, innovation, skills, stunt. Altogether he was ahead of his time. He literally invented modern rock guitar: Hendrix was born in 1942. Prominent guitairsts from his time were Keith Richards, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Frank Zappa etc. But there were very few guitarists who used to work with lead guitar including distortion tone. Keith Richards was famous for using fuzz pedal but to be honest he wasn\u2019t good at lead guitar. He was mostly good at rhythm guitar. Eric Clapton was good at both lead and rhythm guitar. Maybe he was inspired by Hendrix. But among all of them he was one of the fewest guitarists who had lots of tone variation in his playing. Wah wah pedals, distortions, whammy bar etc. Later Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck also adapted it. But hendrix was the first one to do it. He had both iconic riffs and solos. And he became popular soon enough. Withing 2\u20133 years. And so many young dudes like KK Downing were inspired by him. And thus he inspired new rock music by his playing style. He did everything he could do on guitar. And most modern guitarists from then have been following him. Even a little bit of. That\u2019s why he created the \u201cnew rock\u201d of today. His techniques, tones, styles are examples of modern rock. His stunts:  To be honest guitar stunts always can\u2019t determine a guitarists talents. And I am not a big fan of this. I don\u2019t think stunts have developed guitar progression that much except for show off. But Hendrix was one of the first to do so many stunts on stages. Playing with his teeth, between his legs, behind his head etc. And this thing also inspired so many guitarists. And people started to do many stunts from him. He mainstreamed the stunt thing. And he was good at his stunts and did so many stunts. Which made him even more popular. And many people praise his guitar stunts and take these stunts as additional skills. Good or bad. In one word, those were \u201chard\u201d. Conclusion: The thing is that Hendrix was another bluesman. But he wasn\u2019t just another bluesman. He was special. He is the connector of blues and modern rock. He did so many techniques, experimented with his sound, with his guitar, inspired so many people, did so many stunts. He was ahead of his time. The thing is that he was important. And it is very much likely to believe without him rock guitarists wouldn\u2019t develop like today. Many people take this thing very strictly. He is the number one guitarist. For me, there isn\u2019t any number one guitarist. Many guitarists before him, BB King, Chet Atkins, Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry did exist. But Jimi Hendrix came from nowhere and exploded into among us. That\u2019s why he is considered the best guitarist of time. Whether you do like his songs, guitar playing or not. But he was important for music. Whenever I rank guitarists, I make different tiers. And in my eyers hendrix is one the first tier. ",
