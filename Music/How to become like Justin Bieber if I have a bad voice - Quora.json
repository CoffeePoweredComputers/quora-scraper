            "answer_text": "If you want a singing voice like Justin Bieber\u2019s, then I would take some singing lessons with a voice teacher who's an expert in Pop Music Singing. Alternatives include watching YouTube videos on how to properly sing Pop music (including JB songs), Going to a Karaoke bar to sing pop songs and downloading a Karaoke app to sing pop music songs and having somebody to film you singing a cover / rendition of a Justin Bieber (or other Pop Singer) song & then uploading it to all your social media sites. Even though a lot of Pop stars like Justin Bieber sometimes have their vocals processed by electronic devices like Melodyne & Auto-Tune, you still should practice singing to improve your vocals, as you still have to have a decent singing voice for those vocal effects to work properly. Decent Voice = Awesome use of Auto-Tune ; Awful Voice = Awful use of Auto-Tune. Also, there are times when you might be asked to sing Acapella in front of either record producers and/or a live audience. While you might be attracted to the Young Celebrity Lifestyle & inspired by Justin Bieber, I would focus on being myself instead of merely focusing on trying to imitate JB. People (such as Talent Agents, Record Producers & The Public) want to hear Singers who have some originality about them, not ones who are only copying the style of an already-huge Pop music megastar. Also, If you are fortunate enough to become a big time celebrity like Justin Bieber, then you should be very careful about the way you behave as most of the World will be watching your every move almost nonstop. Also beware of & ignore certain temptations from others who want you to do \u201cthe wrong things\u201d, even bosses. It's not worth ruining your reputation, morals or selling your soul to stay famous. Hope this Information helps!!! ",

So there is no perfect recipe for it. However, if you don\u2019t have a voice like his, I would encourage you to figure out what your other talents are and then work really hard on them. Can you cook, write, do tricks? Make a social media page for your talent and maybe you\u2019ll get noticed. Even if you\u2019re good at something less glamorous like math and numbers\u2026.Get a job in the field you\u2019re good in\u2026make money, save and invest to grow your money. Then you can get rich and with that money you can be more like him, because you can afford to hang out where he hangs out. Of course that way will take a long time, but it\u2019s all I can think of.

First thing you need to do is post a totally gay video of you singing a gay song in a gay voice with a gay haircut. Once you get discovered, surround yourself with an entourage of money-sucking, boot licking wannabes. By this time you have should have caught the attention of a few teenie boppers who are more than willing to throw away their parent\u2019s money on your totally gay CD. Once you've aquired your fan base of misdirected teenie boppers, treat them like shit and disdain while acting like you\u2019re totally privileged. And finally, get yourself arrested for doing childish stunts because you think it's totally cool to do so. Did I miss anything? That oughta do it. ",

Also - have a tendency to break the law and act stupid. I'm hoping what you want from his life is his wealth and the women fawning over him. People love him, right? But he has haters too. And in large quantities. One of his songs is the most disliked on YouTube and nothing he would ever want to be private can be. I'd say go for the money by studying hard and making sure you achieve wealth like that. Besides, his entire career is based on luck. Some people never get discovered and the fact that he did at such a young age has made him spoiled. ",
