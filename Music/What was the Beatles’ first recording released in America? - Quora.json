            "answer_text": "The first Beatles recording available in America was \u201cMy Bonnie\u201d/\u201dThe Saints,\u201d released on April 23, 1962 under the name of Tony Sheridan and The Beat Brothers. Tony Sheridan was an early British rock \u2019n\u2019 roll musician who went to Germany because he had more success finding a career there. While the Beatles were in their Hamburg period, they occasionally played as Tony Sheridan\u2019s backup band, but when they did, they were credited as The Beat Brothers, as they were on this record. The record is quite rare and stock copies have sold on eBay for over $4,000.  The earliest American recording by the Beatles available under their own name was \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d/\u201dAsk Me Why,\u201d released by the rhythm & blues label, Vee-Jay Records, sometime in late February 1963. Since the record was released almost one year before the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show, few people in the United States knew who they were at the time, and the record did not sell very many copies, although the record did make it to #35 on the March 15, 1963 Silver Dollar Survey of Dick Biondi. The record is also unusual, because Vee-Jay Records botched the release and misspelled the Fab Four as \u201cthe Beattles\u201d on the label. This record is also quite rare, and a Near Mint copy once sold on eBay for $6000.   ",
