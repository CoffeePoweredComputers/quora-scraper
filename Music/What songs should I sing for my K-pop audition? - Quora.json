            "answer_text": "It\u2019s always good to be prepared. At least prepare 4 songs. 2 English and 2 Korean because they can ask you to sing other song too. This will make them think you came prepared. Start with an English song first. If you sing the English song with good pronunciation then they might be impressed because English language is valued a lot in Korea. Also if you\u2019re foreigner then try to nail the Korean pronunciation for your Korean songs. This will form a good impression on them. Korean pronunciation is important so please try to learn it accurately. Choose songs that are suitable for your pitch. They will assess your singing by: PitchRange (how high and low you can sing)ExpressionsEmotionsQualityYou should be able to deliver the song with emotions. To do that read the lyrics multiple times and imagine yourself in that situation or going through it. This helps. Also match your expressions according to the mood of the song. Also pay attention to your posture. Be confident, polite and always smile when you go for audition. If you think you start auditioning when you start singing then you\u2019re wrong. The moment you enter the building, you start competing. The staff members analyse your every move, gesture and behavior. So always be on your best behavior, smile, be polite and well-mannered, i.e. if you\u2019re going to a global audition or to the company itself. ",
