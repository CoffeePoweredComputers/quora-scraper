            "answer_text": "Joni Mitchell by a mile. Dylan influenced the generation of folkies from the 50\u2019s as well as the Greenish Village crowd in the early 60\u2019s. His songs were quite relevant and I believe his early albums to be his best. Interestingly, Dylan, himself discussed his early prolific lyrics. He stated they were not from him - but a source within, a muse, a voice, a spirit who mouthed all the lyrics - and Dylan merely wrote them down. Song after song, lyric after lyric, Dylan scribbled what came to him through another person, from God or some creative soul. I find that very interesting. And Dylan worried intensely that the spirit who had dictated these songs was slowly going away. And Bob Dylan would be on his own. And in time one can see greatness turning to mish-mash as album after album contained one terrific song and a lot of filler. Dylan still tours, his vocals have degenerated as a \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit\u201d what the audience thinks. Dylan had some great moments. He purposely created a persona, a character, which people believed was him. Quiet, rude, gruff, sarcastic. He revolutionized the folk era by (OMG) playing a screeching electric guitar. But, as he said, he had to grow. \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d Girl From The North County\u201d, \u201cTangled Up In Blue\u201d, \u201cIf You See Her Say Hello\u201d. \u201cTime Passes Slowly\u201d; and the biting cruelest song I have ever heard, \u201cPositively 4th Street\u201d. Joni Mitchell, quite the contrary, was actually the female Dylan (or Dylan was the male Joni). Who knows. Mitchell was a much better songwriter. She created and enormous body of work. Dylan may have published more albums, but quantity not quality is the issue here. Mitchell played a vast many instruments, including dulcimer, piano, guitar and more. She wrote (solely) her lyrics. No collaboration. Michell almost exclusively wrote about herself, in sometimes agonizing detail. Her travels, folks she would meet on her travels; her lovers, being in love, falling out of love, addressing those whom she loved. She expressed mood swings, depression and joy. That is why if you were once a Joni Mitchell fan and could relate exactly to you and how you felt in the world, then, yes, you will forever be a Joni Mitchell fan. Joni is much older now. Remember her first love was painting. she never wanted to be a singer or songwriter. I have toooo many brilliant songs I could name as some of Joni\u2019s Pulitzer Prize nominees. As I am not as familiar with Joni\u2019s jazz fusion albums, I\u2019ll name songs which totally crushed me with their lyrics, composition, aura, despair, and sometimes their utter joy! In no particular order: Carey (from Blue). I love the fun guitar opening, the lyrics tell a great story and it\u2019s just a fun, happy song! I especially like the opening line: \u201cThe wind is in from Africa, last night I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d And of course, \u201cyou\u2019re a mean old Daddy, but I like you\u201d. River: I was just stunned in silence, stunned in tears when I first heard this. It was never a \u2018Christmas\u2019 staple back in 71 on the album Blue. My friends shrugged like, yeah it\u2019s o.k. But when the first notes came on de-de-de-de-de\u2014de-de. Da-da-da-da-da da\u2014-da-da. It\u2019s coming on Christmas\u2026\u2026..\u201d Wow. Bob Dylan could never show the sensitivite to understand, much lest write that song. A Case Of You : again from Blue. Who in his/her normal world could aqute these two subjects and somehow forge them into the most romantic song of our decade. \u201cI am on a lonely road and I am traveling, looking for something what can it be. Oh I hate you some, I love you some, I hate you when I forget about me. I could drink a Case of You, darling, and I would still be on my feet, I\u2019d still be on my feet\u201d. BLUE: Is my favorite song of Joni Mitchells. Maybe not the most creative, but to me, the saddest of all sad songs. The way she pronounces \u2018Blue\u201d with a long, long yet mournful group of syllables. \u201cBlue\u2026\u2026.songs are like tatoos (great imagery. Everybody\u2019s saying that hell\u2019s the hippest way to go, but I don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019m gonna take a look around though Blue/. Blue, here is a shell for you, a foggy lullaby, here is your song from me.\u201d Coyote: One of the best songs and so much fun. I love the guitar strumming, just her and her guitar. Joni was working on this song when she was touring with Dylan, Roger McQuinn, and Gordon Lightfoot. Apparently it was a wild, stoned out, drunken good old time tour. Joni happened to meet Sam Shephard, the actor and playright in one of those southwest bars. They had an affair, and this song is to Shephard. I love the opening line, \u201cNo regrets Coyote, we just come from such different circumstances\u2026\u2026.\u201d And finally, I guess my favorite song for the last two years: AMELIA. I just truly love this song. \u201cOh, Amelia, it was just a false alarm\u2026.\u201d. Joni was traveling in to nowhere, roads and towns she didn\u2019t know, lost in the desert. And she thought of Amelia Earhart, who also had lost and alone. A tenderness wraps around this song. It is so, so sad. The most moving of the lyrics Joni expresses are her realization that \u201cmy life became a travelogue of picture postcard charms\". and the chilling, mournful words\u2026\u2026\"maybe I've never really loved, I guess that's just the truth. I've spend my whole life flying in clouds at icy altitudes\".  ",

            "answer_text": "If I simply answer with who I listen to more often, it\u2019s Bob Dylan. If I answer which one is more musically adventurous, I\u2019d say Joni. If I think about things lyrically, I have great respect for Joni but I think Bob is superior. There are lots of ways to look at it and none of them wholly answer the question. For me, there\u2019s no way to really answer this question. There are only portions of answers in each consideration. ",
