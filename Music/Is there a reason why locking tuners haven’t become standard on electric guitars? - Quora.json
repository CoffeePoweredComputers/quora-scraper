            "answer_text": "So i wrote this sentence last because what follows is a rant i have done a number of times in a number of versions\u2026 TL/DR version, because the average guitarist is a stick in the mud that doesn\u2019t know a good change when it comes along until their favorite guitarist hand it to them and says please. . space in case you don\u2019t want to read a rant . . . . okay so I\u2019m a luthier, i build guitars\u2026 let me tell you something about guitarists\u2026 they HATE change. the basic form and function of the electric guitar hasn\u2019t changed since the 50\u2019s mostly because guitarists don\u2019t want anything new. i can build almost anything\u2026 i can create a custom job for you built to fit you and your playing style\u2026 my last two customs\u2026 Les Pauls, the current one\u2026 a Strat. i love locking tuners, i play in multiple tunings and they are a life saver for me\u2026 i\u2019ve been playing with them for over 20 yrs. but guitarists don\u2019t want them, because a gold top les paul didn\u2019t have them, and a 63 strat didn\u2019t have them. the biggest change accepted in the electric guitar in my life time is the floyd rose style trem, and even that recieved a ton of resistance until a couple of major players started using them. read through the questions here and you will hear so much \u201c how can i sound unique but play the same equipment everyone in rock and blues has played for the past 70 years?\u201d questions. I mean it\u2019s even beyond brand specific\u2026 count the strats vs teles bought in the past 10 yrs, or the SG\u2019s vs Les pauls ( not even going to get into the firebird which is my fa gibson design)\u2026 here\u2019s a thought \u2026 did you know a luthier can build you a guitar with a 26\u2033 scale if you tend to tune to D instead of E. how about build a ingle cutaway body style with a 25.5\u2033 scale 3 pickups in series and phase switching. I\u2019m currently building a 3 mini-humbucker job with a trem, locking tuners, and independant on off/ phase switching for each pickup. ash body, flame maple top, and the body shape is not a strat, a paul, a tele, or anything ( it is double cutaway but it\u2019s clearly not a start) simply so i can build something that isn\u2019t like every other guitar out there.

            "answer_text": "My immediate guess is that it has two do with two things, of which the number one likely is the cost (unless you talk about high end, open gear tuners like Waverly etc.). You get fully functional, solid tuners for quite a lot less than locking ones. Any business/manufacturer is of course cautious about their costs and the price of their products in the marketplace. I will also guess that - for some manufacturers at least - it has to do with tradition (perceived or real). Many guitar players are still pretty traditional. Don\u2019t forget also that any player can learn to lock the strings on non-locking tuners in about five minutes flat when you set your mind to it. The only advantage of locking tuners really is the speed at which to change and tune up guitar strings, one reason why guitar techs loves them. Personally, I love locking tuners but I don\u2019t buy guitars because of it. Nice to have but it isn\u2019t that big a deal. If however I do change tuners on a guitar that I don\u2019t mind modifying, I will use locking ones. ",
