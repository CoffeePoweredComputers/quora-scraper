            "answer_text": "Two things : 1) is that is has good music on it. Which is kind of obvious. But it\u2019s worth stating because it forces you to confront what makes music \u201cgood\u201d, which is too long to go into here \u2026 Oh, all right then. I believe music can be good and bad. But it\u2019s fiendishly complicated to explain exactly why, because every time we discover a new genre of music, the criteria for being good within that genre is different from, and often in contradiction with, whatever rules we discovered for previous genres. Maybe ask another question about that :-) 2) that the music on it \u201cfits together\u201d. Albums are not just compilations of random tracks. Or even \u201cbest hits\u201d compilations of singles. I like the EP format for music. Which is rather like the \u201csuite\u201d in classical music. The way I understand an EP is that is basically small enough that it only needs one idea or theme (not \u201cmusical theme\u201d, I mean conceptual theme) but big enough that you can and should explore different aspects of that theme, through a contrast of moods. An EP is multiple aspects of a single idea. That\u2019s what gives it interest and consistency. So what about an album? I\u2019m tempted to say that a good album is bigger than an EP. It really needs to have more than one theme. Like a symphony, it needs two or more. An album is a novel not a short story. It needs to describe some kind of \u201cworld\u201d where multiple things interrelate or interact. And yet still bring them together into a coherent whole. I\u2019m being deliberately vague because music is vast, and there can be so many ways of doing this, which are (again) genre dependent. But I think that\u2019s important. For people to be bothered to listen to 30+ minutes of music, it can\u2019t be a single idea. To carry you that far, you need some sense that you\u2019ve covered a territory or explored a space, to see the richness within it. But, as I say, this is purposefully vague, because there are so many ways of doing it. This is a great album. Despite being a single minimalist vamp between two chords on a single groove. It still takes you on a journey and explores a world.  Brian Eno can make very long albums from what seems like a single idea. And yet which nevertheless seem to work because he finds subtle variety within the simple consistency. (That\u2019s not always the case, some of his albums are just wittering on too long without covering enough ground.) So yeah, a good album is a consistent world in some way, and a world which has more than one thing in it. Often people complain that an album is \u201cnot good\u201d because of \u201cfiller\u201d. What they mean is tracks that don\u2019t add anything. Either because they are unnecessary repetitions of an idea that a previous track explored. Or because they don\u2019t really fit into the overall coherence of the world. Sometimes, an objectively \u201cnot very good\u201d track can nevertheless work on a good album, because it does fit into the overall whole. Short instrumental breaks, hip-hop sketches etc. can do this. You wouldn\u2019t listen to them outside the context of the album. But inside it they help to structure the space. ",

            "answer_text": "There are exceptions, but a music album is generally good if: It contains no filler - all songs are written from the heart without adding inferior songs just to make it an album (best to release an EP if there are only 6 good songs).It runs less than 40 minutes - too long an album gets stale after about 35 minutes. Very few artists can get away with long albums that are actually good.It has at least 3\u20134 catchy songs - a lot of artists write for themselves, which can be a mistake because they aren\u2019t thinking of their audience. Crafting a song should include the experience of the listeners, so the chords, arrangement and vocal melodies should be meticulously shaped for the best listener experience.Has a good song order - this part takes some very careful brainstorming as it is a crucial component of the experience of the listener. It\u2019s like making a movie and writing the scenes and how they fit together.An album should be an \u2018experience\u2019. Too many past albums got boring after a few songs and would disappoint the listener. An album is a work of art and, at the same time, a marketing tool. Some songs must end up on the cutting room floor if the album is to work. On my band\u2019s first album, Ambush, I regret putting 12 songs on it, and I now know the song order could have been better planned. It actually did well in Europe, but listening to it now reveals the mistakes we made. Our second album was better produced, but would have been better with one less particular song, which was absolute \u2018filler\u2019. It didn\u2019t ruin the album, but it was that moment where you could check your email. It was a great support for our tours, though. Great songs give you goosebumps. Good songs get you groovin\u2019. Everything else is filler. ",

            "answer_text": "This also applies to any other type of art (film, book, painting, etc.): 1.) Immediately grabs my attention - that doesn't mean that I have to like it immediately, but it has to grab my attention, and I have to remember it afterwards. Sometimes an album will be so abrasive or out there that I can't be said to enjoy it, but it will make me want to go back to and listen to it. 2.) Reveals depth and enjoyment on repeated listens - Layers, motifs, a multiplicity of meanings in the lyrics. Depth, however, does not necessarily mean complexity. There are several simple albums that I would consider deep because they strike such a specific emotional nerve and do so with incredible poignancy, The Replacements' Let it Be comes to mind. 3.) Enjoyment over an extended period of time - This goes with 2, but the two are not wholly interwoven. A complex, deep, album may reveal itself to be boring or bloated after six or seven spins, but a great album can be played over and over again and I'll be able to enjoy even if I'm not listening for depth or content. And how do you achieve that? A lot of it's subjective. Play the kinds of chords I like, do something that I've never heard before, write lyrics that resonate with me emotionally or mentally, weave your album together so it feels like a cohesive unit, etc. And when the songs are better when played together than they would be separately, then you know it is a good album.

            "answer_text": "I'm mostly a classical music guy, in which the nature of an album is a bit different, however I've always compared the format of the rock and roll album to a symphony. For those who aren't well versed in classical music, a symphony is a collection of four to five \"movements,\" which is to say, independent pieces of music with a definitive start and stop, but which, when played together in order, are greater than the sum of their parts. I could go into detail about how this works and why, but its not strictly important to the discussion at hand.  However, I also think that is what makes an album great. The songs in it are independent pieces of music, but when they are better together than apart, the album is good. Sometimes a bad album has a good song (for my part, I only really like three songs on Billy Joel's Storm Front, for instance, but Downeaster Alexa is my favorite song he's ever written) The way one achieves this usually has to do with emotional arc (placing the songs in the right order), and a thorough examination of a theme (the songs all address a similar set of subjects, usually from different points of view). And, of course, the songs themselves need to be good, which is a whole different question. ",
