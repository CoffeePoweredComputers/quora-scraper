            "answer_text": "Most of their albums are indispensable. Most of them are many people\u2019s favorites. There is no clear best, although I have my faves. If I were introducing someone to the Beatles, I would start with a middle album - namely Rubber Soul. Their earlier albums are more primitive - pretty much all love songs - and primitive by music standards established by the latter Beatles and ever since. Their latter albums progress through ever advancing studio techniques. It is fascinating to hear their progress album by album. However, since we are going back in time and are not living those times, I think you\u2019d get more enjoyment alternating between their more raw emotional early work and their sophisticated latter work. The highlights of Rubber Soul are (my picks, I need not remind): \u201cDrive My Car\u201d, \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d, \u201cMichelle\u201d, and \u201cIn My Life\u201d. Be sure to have the U.K versions of their albums (now standard everywhere) - as the Beatles intended - except Magical Mystery Tour which was not released as a long play album in the UK.) Ideally, take the time to play each album a few times before moving onto the next. I would play Revolver next. It did follow Rubber Soul sequentially and I think shows the greatest development in their sound between any two consecutive albums. It came out when they stopped touring and focused on producing the best possible records on vinyl. The Rolling Stone magazine ranked Revolver the best album by any rock group ever. It certainly has its gems: \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d, \u201cHere, There, Everywhere\u201d, \u201cGood Day Sunshine\u201d, \u201cFor No One\u201d, \u201cGot to Get You Into My Life\u201d. It has the very psychedelic \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d. Now go back to their beginnings and listen to Please, Please, Me. This is Beatles at their rawest: \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d, \u201cAnna (Go to Him)\u201d, and their earliest artistic ideas: \u201cLove Me Do\u201d, \u201c\u201dP.S. I Love You\u201d, and their first brilliant self-penned rocker \u201cSince I Saw Her Standing There\u201d. Many critics consider Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band their greatest achievement. The flow of the first three songs \u201cSgt. Peppers . . .\u201d, \u201cWith a Little Help From My Friends\u201d, and \u201cLucy in the Sky with Diamonds\u201d along with the reprise of \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s . . .\u201d just before the perfect finale \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d, gave this album the feel of a whole album meant as one piece rather than a just collection of songs that albums were up until then. This record also includes \u201cFixing a Hole\u201d, \u201cWhen I\u2019m Sixty-Four\u201d, \u201cLovely Rita\u201d and the mystical \u201cWithin You Without You\u201d. Then go back to the innocent early days With the Beatles. Highlights: \u201cAll My Loving\u201d, \u201cPlease Mr. Postman\u201d, \u201cYou Really Got a Hold on Me\u201d, \u201cNot a Second Time\u201d, and \u201cMoney (That\u2019s What I Want)\u201d. Magical Mystery Tour was originally just a double EP, but in the U.S., they added some great singles not attached to any album - particularly \u201cPenny Lane\u201d and \u201cStrawberry Fields\u201d and made a full album out of it. \u201cFool on the Hill\u201d and \u201cI Am the Walrus\u201d are generally considered the highlights of the MMT songs. Back again to A Hard Day\u2019s Night: highlights: the title track, \u201cIf I Fell\u201d, \u201cAnd I Love Her\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Do That\u201d, and \u201cI\u2019ll Be Back\u201d. I would play Let it Be next. Yes, it was their last release, but it was recorded mostly 2nd to last. But, musically, it belongs even before their white album. The song \u201cGet Back\u201d and some of the others were in a way their way to get back to the roots of their rock and roll music - without the heavy studio treatments of their previous three albums. Of course \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d are sublime. Let it Be Naked has some refreshing alternative versions of most of these songs and others - without Phil Spector\u2019s soppy choirs, but I\u2019ve grown accustomed to his versions. At this point, I would break from their albums as they released them and pick up all their loose great singles from their early years. They are found on the snobbishly un-Beatles-like named Past Masters, Volume One, which includes the two songs that set off Beatlemania in the U.S.: \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d and \u201cShe Loves You\u201d - and also German versions of those songs. The package also has \u201cI Feel Fine\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s a Woman\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m Down\u201d, and my favorite \u201cThis Boy\u201d. Likewise, the Beatles rounded up singles and B sides un-tethered to any latter day albums on a package called Past Masters, Volume Two. Both Volumes also contain alternate takes of a few songs that do appear on albums - usually the single versions of those songs. I can\u2019t think of an alternate version here that I prefer to the album version, so, it is perfectly fine to just acquire the unique songs. The one alternative that might be worth having on your playlists would be the single / rock \u2019n roll version of \u201cRevolution\u201d = with Nicky Hopkins on the electric piano, although if I had to choose, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stick with the shooby-dooby version on The Beatles. Album-less gems on this collection include \u201cDay Tripper\u201d, \u201cWe Can Work it Out\u201d, \u201cRain\u201d, \u201cLady Madonna\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Down\u201d, \u201cThe Ballad of John and Yoko\u201d, and the greatest song ever made to make a sad one feel better: \u201cHey Jude\u201d. In fact, the Beatles did at one point release this package around the time they broke up as The Beatles Again before that was changed shortly after to Hey Jude, until many years later: Past Masters Volume Two. The names just kept getting worse. And while you are picking out single songs, I suggest grabbing three of the four original songs on Yellow Submarine (\u201cAll Together Now\u201d, \u201cHey Bulldog\u201d, and \u201cIt\u2019s All Too Much\u201d) and skip the rest of the movie track. The other original song is the only Beatles song ever produced that I just don\u2019t like at all. Next, I recommend their most underrated album: Beatles for Sale. Incredibly good songs: \u201cNo Reply\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m a Loser\u201d, \u201cBaby\u2019s in Black\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll Follow the Sun\u201d, \u201cMr. Moonlight\u201d, \u201cEight Days a Week\u201d, \u201cWords of Love\u201d. Then it would be time to enjoy the wonderful world of The Beatles (aka \u201cthe white album\u201d). Personally, this is probably the most important album in my life. It got me through the turmoil of middle school and the Vietnam War insanity. When my kids were young I sang \u201cGood Night\u201d, \u201cMother Nature\u2019s Sun\u201d, and \u201cMartha, My Dear\u201d (changed to \u201cMargaux, My Dear\u201d for the sake of my daughter Margaux) as lullabies. What is more rousing than \u201cBack in the USSR\u201d, \u201cBirthday\u201d, or \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d, or more beautiful than \u201cDear Prudence\u201d, \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d, \u201cBlackbird\u201d, \u201cSexy Sadie\u201d, or \u201cLong Long Long\u201d or more fun than . . . well, half the album. I for one think the soundscape \u201cRevolution 9\u201d is a brilliantly wonderful ride. The U.K. version of Help! is almost twice as good as the wonderful U.S. version I played over and over as a kid. You still get the title track, \u201cThe Night Before\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Hide Your Love Away\u201d, and \u201cTicket to Ride\u201d, but \u201cDizzy Miss Lizzy\u201d and the most covered song in history: \u201cYesterday\u201d. Finally, Abbey Road, which opens with \u201cCome Together\u201d, makes you fall in love with \u201cSomething\u201d, rouses you with \u201cOh! Darling\u201d, endears you with \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d, wins you completely over with \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d, takes you to dream land with \u201cBecause\u201d, then sweeps you away with the long medley that ends with Ringo\u2019s only drum solo followed by their only guitar dual with McCartney, Harrison, and Lennon trading licks. That is \u201cThe End\u201d and how you should end your Beatles exploration. ",

            "answer_text": "I have written this elsewhere on Quora but can\u2019t find it. For me I go back and forth between Rubber Soul and Revolver. I grew up with the Beatles but we were trying to be hard nosed street kids, so for us the early Beatles were for the girls. We listened to harder rougher stuff, Rolling Stones, Yardbirds etc. Rubber Soul changed all of that for me. Feels like I was maturing right along with the Beatles in that that Album spoke to me of different worlds, different ways of thinking and being. It is an Album of beauty and wonder to me and will always have a place in my heart because it became my entry into a world that was growing and changing along with me (and all my hormones). Revolver got down and pushed those changes! George showed up in a big way with his three songs on the album, everyone of them unique, credible and strong. No more \u201cyeah yeah yeah\u201d here. (no dis here, I have come to love every song written by this group appreciating them for what they were where and when.) Us hard nosed street boys could get behind this music. The world was changing fast and this was reflected in Revolver in big ways. There was a cultural shifting process that began with the Beatles in 1964. Somehow they took our music reflected it back to us then changed it. They were able to hold up a mirror for all of us reflecting the time in which we lived and the source of our feelings. They then broke the mirror and handed us back windows to see it all differently. In so many ways this to me is the power of what they accomplished. This ability, became most evident to me with Rubber Soul (as did the use of drugs theirs and mine) and crystallized with Revolver. No doubt Sgt. Pepper was an astonishing accomplishment but in someways they and the world were escaping from reality as we all rushed headlong towards a very big fall. I began high school in 1964 and graduated in 1968. I shook Bobby Kennedy\u2019s hand two-days before he was assassinated during my last week of school. We had not had a proper chance to mourn the loss of Martin Luther King (assassinated in April of that year) and we were knocked off our feet. For me the fantasy was over and the White Album for me characterizes the breakdown that was beginning. The shift between Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour to the White Album was the shift I felt in my life. I think \u201cI am the Walrus\u201d captures the madness of that transition perfectly. I digress, love Rubber Soul, but it usually comes down to Revolver. Grounded, forward thinking, incredible songs, perhaps some of the best musicianship, and always always for me marking some serious turning points in the cultural upheaval that begins in 64\u2032 with the assassination of JFK and the rise of the Beatles. Post White Album, I feel very personal about some of the songs on Let it Be (usually like this Album better than my friends) and of course the beautiful goodbye of Abbey Road concluding with The End. What a magnificent send off. But its all subjective so I stick with Revolver and to this day remain personally grateful for every note they played together. ",
