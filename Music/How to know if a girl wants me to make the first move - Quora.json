            "answer_text": "Looking back, it\u2019s obvious to me. In some sense (not scientific), they get in your face. They are always around. They tease you (nicely) or make fun of you (nicely), they talk to you when they could talk to someone else. They ask you stupid questions, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite movie?\u201d or \u201cDo you like dogs?\u201d They ENGAGE you in a way the others aren\u2019t. The pester you. They get under your skin or into your consciousness. It\u2019s instinctive. You have this sudden realization that they\u2019re always around, paying attention to you, and you realize they\u2019ve filled your mind for no reason you can think of. While you\u2019d barely noticed them before or had kind-of admired them from afar, now you\u2019re strangely but intensely aware of them. Women make \u201cthe first move.\u201d Men never do. The woman always makes the first move \u2014 not practically or politically, but biologically. They guy\u2019s job is to pick up on this and respond \u2014 not with passionate kisses, but with the realization that you\u2019ve been selected, and YOUR first move is to respond. In days of old, that would be asking her for a \u201cdate,\u201d and by that time, you\u2019d know she\u2019d say \u201cOK.\u201d Since she\u2019s selected you , you know she\u2019ll say yes. Then you worry about the date, how to act, etc. I suppose nobody cares about that anymore. But the point that is timeless is: She selected you as \u201cthe first move\u201d got into your face, and made you notice her. It\u2019s her invitation for YOU to make what you think is \u201cyour first move.\u201d Which is really the second move, but whatever.Make your first move. Ask her out or whatever they do now. Just the two of you, a movie, lunch, a walk, come over to watch a movie, whatever.My specifics are out of date, but the INSTINCTS are never out of date. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m now married so my advise may no longer be relevant, but when I was dating I would always appreciate it when a woman made the first move. I can see how in today\u2019s climate of sexual assault accusations that it may become the norm for women to HAVE to make the first move lest the man feel like he will be shamed for all eternity if he miscalculates and moves in for a kiss and the women is not reciprocating his feelings. I think it should be pretty easy for a woman to comprehend a man\u2019s body language to tell if he\u2019s interested in her (at least physically). Men are usually not subtle, or even gentlemanly and suave, about things and will make it easy for a woman to understand if there\u2019s interest on his part. There was only one time where I was dating a girl and she miscalculated her move (went in eyes closed for a kiss totally out of nowhere). I still went with it. I didn\u2019t put my hand on her shoulder and say, \u201cWhoa\u2026what are you DOING?!\u201d I still went with the moment despite feeling awkward. But all the other times where the girl I was dating went for the first move, it was awesome. There were times I made the first move too, but I have no idea if the girl thought it was awesome or not. You put a lot on the line, making the first move. Just throwing your chin out there. So it takes a gut check and surety of ego to have the confidence to make the first move. For guys it\u2019s a lot different\u2026more difficult to read the seemingly imperceptible signs of a woman\u2019s level of interest. For women making the first move, it should be simple as long as she isn\u2019t reading too much into things. Women have a tendency to over-analyze situations and turn irrelevant things into things of importance. Also factor in the climate of sexual harassment claims and a potential for general hesitancy of males to make the first move\u2014like I said, I have been out of the dating scene now since 2006, so my experiences may no longer hold any relevance.
