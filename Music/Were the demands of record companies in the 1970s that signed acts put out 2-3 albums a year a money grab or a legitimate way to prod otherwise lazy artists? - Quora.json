            "answer_text": "Krystka, I don\u2019t believe it was either of those scenarios. There was big demand for product back in those days believe it or not and you\u2019d have to remember that music had finally evolved and being produced with what was then allot of new technology and advances from the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. As an example, multi-track recording, better microphones, better distribution networks, guitars, keyboards and God let\u2019s not forget the Moog. Artist where excited and label\u2019s couldn't get enough of the public\u2019s appetite. But with the advances in technology over the next 15 or 20 years cost begin to sky rocket. Better recording qualities, releasing in several formats, producer fee\u2019s and artist demands for better pay and participation, which was only fair. There where also allot of original instrumentation used in the late 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, like strings, horn players, etc. Label\u2019s needed a way to cut cost, but yet they also knew that they had to keep their most successful artist happy. As an artist we tend to forget when we enter the main stream, like it or not it\u2019s business. And as someone who has run an independent label I can assure you that I\u2019ve had to lay the art aside when pinching the pennies to buy promotional materials, instruments, build out studio\u2019s, etc. More back to your question, no it wasn\u2019t as much a money grab as the excitement around an evolving industry that has gotten us to where we are today. Where there money grabbers, absolutely. Where there and are there lazy artist out there that got lucky, absolutely. There\u2019s greed in allot of industries and the music industry is no exception. What set\u2019s us apart is our own integrity and character and while not perfect do your damn best to keep good product coming. Darrell ",

            "answer_text": "We spent one year writing and recording one record album and had another 6\u20138 songs for a second album we started. Granted we all had jobs, but bands also spend 75% of their time on the road performing so I would consider a touring band only able to write perhaps 1\u20132 albums a year when they are busy touring and promoting and album. Also, it is far better to write music and record it live a few times as you will hear that you accidentaly played some cool parts and now the final version of the song can have a combination of the best ideas from perhaps four to six recordings. It is always better to record each song days later so you will get new and more ideas. Those bands that tried to push the envelope likely ended up with nice sounding music that never received much popularity, radio airplay or sold all that many copies. A band about to hit the big time needs to have perhaps 30\u201340 songs such that if they suceed they can quickly get music into the pipeline and this is what the Beatles did in the early years. ",
