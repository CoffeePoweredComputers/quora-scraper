On Wikipedia\u2019s page for \u201dHeaven\u201d it says: Upon the release of \"Heaven\", fans and media speculated that it was dedicated to the child Beyonc\u00e9 lost during a miscarriage. The singer publicly talked about the miscarriage which happened before the birth of Blue Ivy during an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show and her HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream (2013). Beyonc\u00e9 also wrote and recorded a song called \"Heartbeat\" to cope with the loss, which did not make it on the album. Her husband, rapper Jay Z, had also mentioned the miscarriage in his song \"Glory\" (2012) released after the birth of Blue Ivy. The experience made her doubt the fact that she will have children in the future and she described it as \"one of the hardest things\" she had to endure.\u201d ",
