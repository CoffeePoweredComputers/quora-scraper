            "answer_text": "Songwriter earnings are unpredictable and notoriously difficult to estimate. Without a detailed record of all record sales, downloads, streams, radio spins, and licenses to TV, films, and advertisements, it's impossible to know how much a song has earned. That said, I can give you a framework. To understand a hit songwriter's compensation, you need to understand the Music Publishing industry, which exists to support songwriter interests and monetize their copyrights. I used to work for a Music Publishing company, and we negotiated deals on behalf of writers like Dr. Luke and Max Martin (but not them, specifically). I can't estimate dollar-amounts for these writers, as every hit behaves differently and some of the royalty streams are impossible to estimate. In simple terms, songwriters make money in three ways: Mechanical Royalties (album sales and digital downloads), Performance Royalties (radio play) and Synchronization Royalties (licensing to TV, Films, Ads). There are other revenue streams--especially with the advent of Internet streaming services--but these three represent the lion's share. Here is how Dr. Luke would get paid from a hit song: 1. Mechanical Royalties: Think of this as \"money for when someone buys a copy of your song (physical or digital).\" In the U.S., the Record Label is responsible for paying the songwriter a fixed rate of $0.091 for each song sold. A simple example: Bob Dylan releases a new 10 song album, which sells an even 1MM copies. The Label owes Bob $910,000 for letting them \"publish\" his 10 songs. Here is an example with two writers: Bob Dylan writes a 10 song album with Shakira, and Shakira writes 80% of each song (Bob writes the other 20%). This album also sells 1MM copies. Here, Shakira is owed $72,800 and Bob is owed $18,200. This gets very, very complicated -- But that's a fair primer. When Dr. Luke writes a song, he might not write all of it. In that case, he needs to negotiate what % of the \"Publishing\" he owns. I've heard that it's possible to receive an upfront \"songwriter fee\", either as an advance against future Mechanicals or as a standalone fee. But this is supposedly quite rare. 2. Performance Royalties - Think of this as \"money for when your song gets played on the radio, TV, or in any public setting, even sports arenas and bars.\" Unlike Mechanical Royalties, there is no clean formula for calculating what you are owed. To collect this income, songwriters must associate with a Performance Rights Organization (PRO), such as ASCAP, BMI or SESAC. PRO's are non-profit organizations that license their broad their huge catalogs to broadcasters (ex: Clear Channel radio; NBC) and public arenas (ex: Madison Square Garden). How much? BMI alone collected $901MM in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009. That pie is split amongst nearly every songwriter imaginable, from John Lennon to John Legend (to your cousin Tom Lemon, who plays in a local Bluegrass band). Given that he writes some of the most-played Pop hits in the world, Dr. Luke would make a significant share of his income from Performance Royalties. 3. Synchronization Royalties - Think of this as \"money for when you license your song to a TV show, Film, Trailer, Video Game, TV Commercial, or any other visual that needs to be 'sync'd' with music.\"Each medium (TV, Internet, Film) has its own standard price structure. License terms can vary quite a bit, depending on who has negotiating leverage (Is the song a huge hit, or is it a no-name band dying for exposure?). In general, songwriters are given an advance (TV shows can fetch $1,000 to $25,000; car commercials can fetch $50,000 to $300,000). ",

            "answer_text": "There are different ways to get paid for a song you've written. The question seeks a simple answer, and there isn\u2019t one. While a megabit song, even today, could provide millions in royalties and licenses for a writer, that is very much the exception to the rule. I do have friends, however, who have had songs recorded by major artists and gotten life-changing royalty checks and opened doors for themselves for future opportunities all beginning with a single song. The main ways that a songwriter would earn money on a song are through (1) mechanical royalties, (2) performance royalties, and (3) licenses. Mechanical royalties are paid to the songwriter and publisher when the song appears on a recording. In many cases, that rate is as defined by federal law, currently 9.1 cents per copy of the recording (this amount can be negotiated but in the absence of an agreement, the law sets the royalty, and once your song is released into the public, the writer\u2019s permission is not required for someone else to record it - just the royalty payment). Thus a track on a million-selling album could be worth $100,000 (assuming a single writer who owns the publishing, which is often NOT the case). Then the performance rights to the song are generally administered by ASCAP or BMI or other performance rights organization, which collect fees from radio stations, music venues, bars and restaurants that play live or recorded music, department stores that play music in the elevators and so forth, and then distribute the fees paid by those licensees to the songwriters and publishers, based on survey samples and data collection and a distribution formula. So those who write the songs that are played most on radio and other venues are paid the larger share of the distributed performance or songwriting royalties. Then there are specifically negotiated licenses for such things as film soundtracks and TV commercials and such where the user of the material does not have an automatic right to use the material under a compulsory license. This fee just depends on the strength of the material and the bargaining power of the parties. If my unknown song and Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll\u201d are being considered for the Cadillac TV commercial campaign, one of us would be paid more for our song than the other, as you can imagine. In the digital age there are also lots of fractions of cents changing hands via services like Spotify and Pandora and ITunes Radio and YouTube, where licensing fees are negotiated between owners of music catalogues and the streaming services. For indepdendent songwriters and artists, these outlets and income sources have proven a blessing and a curse since the technology enables them to get their music out to a wide audience without the aid of a major distributor or record label, but of course, everyone else can do it too, so it is still a crowded universe within which one is challenged to stand out. And because CD sales and now even downloads are becoming things of the past, the artist who does not get a lot of airplay has to depend a lot on the fractions of cents from these streaming services, and for most, they don't add up to much.
