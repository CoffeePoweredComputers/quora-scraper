            "answer_text": "Depends on various factors. Such as severity of your will. There is nothing mentioned about trans people in islam although there might be verses which are no yet intrepreted in regards to this.However, there is something mentioned about \u201cmukannathun\u201d in various hadiths. They might be similar to modern day trans people although it is not certain since back then it was also common to call eunuchs as mukannathun and they clearly do not fall under the category of trans people.Generally scholars agree that people might transition if they have a biological basis. Now this is where things will get confusing, because by biological people understand the condition of intersex people, most tend to ignore other factors, eventhough, the latest researches have discovered that most trans people have a structure of grey mattter in the brain that is closer to their gender identity than to their assigned birth sex. And as you can understand this also falls under biological cause because of underdevelopment in brain. There for in my opinion it is permissible but intense examination should be carried upon to permit. May Allah bless all of us and Grant us the Highest elevations of Jannah. ",
