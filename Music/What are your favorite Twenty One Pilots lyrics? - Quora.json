            "answer_text": "I have a few. In no specific order, 1. Kitchen Sink, \u201cThey don\u2019t know you, and neither do I\u201d This line doesn\u2019t seem to hit many people, as it could be considered one of the tamer lines in this song, but I love it. So many of the songs under this genre of music and lyric strain to try and sound like they knew exactly what the listener is facing, but this line turns that concept around. The fact is, they don\u2019t know. 2. Holding On To You, \u201cTie a noose around your mind/Loose enough to breath fine and tie it/To a tree tell it you belong to me/This ain\u2019t a noose this is a leash, and I\u2019ve got news for you, you must obey me\u201d That is admittedly quite a few lines, but the way they tie together this line is so good. When your mind is wandering to such dark places, the concept of taking something as violent as a noose and using it as a leash is such a powerful one. This line hits hard on a lot of levels, for people who are suicidal, those who have anxiety, depression, or other conditions. 3. Migraine, \u201cI am not as fine as I seem/Pardon me for yelling and telling you green gardens/Are not what\u2019s growing in my psyche\u201d I personally have a lot of anxiety, and one of the habits I\u2019ve picked up is compulsive apologizing, for many things, but especially complaining. A line like this that put that feeling so nicely, along with the somewhat theatrical delivery drove this line (and this song) into being an all time favorite. 4. Car Radio, \u201cI\u2019m forced to deal with what I feel/there is not distraction to mask what is real\u201d I don\u2019t have words to put that will encapsulate why I love this line so much. I know I sound really dramatic, and that\u2019s because I am, but this line was what made me become a fan of this band. It\u2019s raw, and emotional, and real. 5. March To The Sea, \u201cNo one looks up anymore/Because you might get a raindrop in your eye/And heaven forbid they see you cry\u201d I actually didn\u2019t hear this song until about two months ago, which is unfortunate because it\u2019s definitely one of their better songs in my opinion. The themes of the song in general are really powerful, and kind of tune well to how I think, as well as having an amazing sound. But it\u2019s this line in particular that drove me to this song. In all honesty, I don\u2019t know why I like this one so much, it just makes sense. That\u2019s all. ",
