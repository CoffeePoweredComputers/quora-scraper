            "answer_text": "It has indeed been a great year for music - there were so many great albums from the best artists to look forward to. I really enjoyed listening to Atoms for Peace, Sigur Ros, Daft Punk, Disclosure, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Justin Timberlake, Vampire Weekend, Chvrches, Arctic Monkeys, How to Destroy Angels and many more artists this year, but these three albums were my personal favorites. 3. Nine Inch Nails - Hesitation Marks  What a return to form for the genius Trent Reznor, after his excellent side projects scoring soundtracks and How to Destroy Angels (whose album was pretty good too). Hesitation Marks sounds like NIN of old, but it is different as well. By bringing together a great set of musicians, it is a great evolution of sound for NIN, after a long hiatus. Standouts: Copy of A, Disappointed, Satellite, Find My Way 2. Arcade Fire - Reflektor  Talking about evolution of sound, this album is so good, it seems like Arcade Fire was always a indie dance outfit. By roping in James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, they've just gone on and made a poignant dance record (like LCD Soundsystem), while still retaining the amazing Arcade Fire musicianship. Can't wait to hear some of these songs live. There is no weak song on this record.Standouts: Afterlife, Normal Person, Joan of Arc My album of the year, though, is: 1. The National - Trouble Will Find Me  This is only my personal album of the year, only because The National, by nature, are an acquired taste and so not easily accessible to everyone. I didn't particularly appreciate this album on first listen, but after a slow burn, I think this is a masterpiece, that I cannot stop listening to. There is not a single song that I can do without, the lyrics are fantastic and the songs are exquisitely layered and arranged. Do give this a (fair) shot with a few repeat listens, I'm sure you'll be hooked.Standouts: All of them, but particularly Don't Swallow the Cap, Fireproof, Humiliation, Pink Rabbits, Graceless ",

            "answer_text": "My top 5: Disclosure, Settle: Already one of my favorite dance albums of all time. Dance music is a genre that often lacks replay value. Not the case with Settle. (A friend gave me this CD \u2013 commute \u2013 a week after its release back in May. Half a year later, it is still in my car.) These are understated pieces that reveal their complexities with many listens. From the driving opener of \u201cWhen a Fire Starts to Burn\u201d to the subdued (but poignant) closer \u201cHelp Me Lose My Mind\u201d, this is a fantastic album that everyone should give a spin. King Krule, 6 Feet Beneath the Moon: Krule makes it onto the top 5 list for sheer originality. His voice is like nothing else. His production hits a wide range, but on average hits a tone I\u2019d call, \u201ca textured, layered jazz cellar with deep corners.\u201d  His lyrics, which can be tough to parse out even on paper, make for beautiful listening \u2013 you\u2019ll hear rhyme and rhythm on this debut LP that you won\u2019t hear anywhere else. Excited to see what KK brings to the table next.  Mikal Cronin, MCII: A near-perfect sophomore album that pushes and pulls between gentle pop and distorted garage-roc k (Cronin\u2019s known for the latter. He learned fuzz pedals from Ty Segall.)  Great song-writing, insanely catchy hooks, and lyrics that mirror the conflicted blend of sound created by the pop-garage dynamic presented on MCII.  Vampire Weekend, Modern Vampires of the City: Great tone reminiscent of Paul Simon\u2019s Graceland.  The descriptive, wry lyrics of Manhattan life lend themselves to this comparison, and seem intimately close to their writer, Ezra Koenig. Time is a constant theme throughout, and Ezra, close to his 30th, takes MVOTC as a chance to remind us of this, opening with a cautious refrain, \u201cdon\u2019t wait\u201d, and ending with a warning, \u201cyou take your time.\u201d   Lorde, Pure Heroine: Came to this new wave-pop record with cynicism after \u201cRoyals\u201d got blown up by the radio. I was pleasantly surprised. \u201cRibs,\u201d with its soaring vocals and pulsing synths, stands out as a highlight (also includes a Broken Social Scene mention!) Additional bonus points if you enable your album repeat function: the closing song loops back into the opener perfectly \u2013 a nod to the effort and vision required for this album.  Laura Marling, Once I Was an Eagle: I had to add a sixth entry; the first seven songs of this record are too good to omit from an end of the year list. It\u2019s a folk medley that bleeds into itself lyrically, tonally (drop C), and melodically. These songs (as well as the rest of the album) require full engagement to be appreciated, but are completely worth the effort. ",
