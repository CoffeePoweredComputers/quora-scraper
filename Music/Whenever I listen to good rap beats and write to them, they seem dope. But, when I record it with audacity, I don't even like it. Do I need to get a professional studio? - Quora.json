            "answer_text": "Audacity is a good entry into the recording world. Might be time to step up to a real DAW. And there is a fully featured one that works great for beats & loops as well as instruments. Best part is it\u2019s FREE Waveform Free | digital audio workstation band editing software - Tracktion Unlimited tracks, full midi editing, comping, track freezing etc. The workflow is super intuitive and it\u2019s a single screen DAW, so no need to swap screens to use the mixer or edit sections. It is very loop & beat friendly too with drop & drag simplicity, quick duplication of sections/bars being just a couple other features that help in your particular genre. You can have the beat tracks laid out in a matter of minutes. The Basic Pro version includes some very useful plugins, Antares Auto-tune, Melodyne Essential, Imagina Loop package and Collective (tons of software instruments) for $119. Antares & Melodyne are two awesome pieces of software and would cost you $100 each by themselves. I have owned Waveform Pro Standard since it was known as Tracktion (v5) and I make sure I keep it updated. I generally use Pro Tools 99% of the time now, but still use Waveform at times when I want to be up and recording in minutes and for lower track count projects I want to complete quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "Audacity is known in the industry as the poor mans recording software. Now don't get me wrong-it is called that cus it's free yet it can do a lot. Personally I recorded with audacity for a while and the way to get the best of it is by learning editing techniques on YouTube you would be suprised how you can get an authentic clean sound with audacity and it has a load off effects too. If you already know this then maybe you are using a mic that isn't good enough or your recording space is not helping you either, so check these things. Personally I don't record with audacity anymore I use FL studio and sometimes I play with logic, garage band, pro tools, abelton live, and cubase. These are some of the the major softwares. I advice you to use one if them instead of Audacity. Going to a pro studio will cost you more money than home recording, if you can afford it then do it. If you can't or you want to learn the trade yourself then switch to a better software and learn how to use it properly. ",

            "answer_text": "You may not need a pro studio but some decent 'monitor' speakers (KRK's, Yamaha, M-Audio, Monoprice, etc) and better software. I've used Audacity before but have only been patient enough to create mashups with it. It's not as intuitive and easy to use as FL Studio, Ableton or Logic, especially when you're doing complex automation, audio chopping, midi writing and editing, etc. For starters, look up any of the above mentioned gear and software, keep on listening to a lot of music and producing!
