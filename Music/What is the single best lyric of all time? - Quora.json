            "answer_text": "Viva La Vida ~ Coldplay I used to rule the worldSeas would rise when I gave the wordNow in the morning I sleep aloneSweep the streets I used to own I used to roll the diceFeel the fear in my enemy's eyesListen as the crowd would sing\"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!\" One minute I held the keyNext the walls were closed on meAnd I discovered that my castles standUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explainOnce you go there was neverNever an honest wordAnd that was when I ruled the world It was the wicked and wild windBlew down the doors to let me inShattered windows and the sound of drumsPeople couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries waitFor my head on a silver plateJust a puppet on a lonely stringOh who would ever want to be king? I hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the world I hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the world And Oh!  Also... one great masterpiece Shape of My Heart ~ Sting  He deals the cards as a meditation And those he plays never suspect He doesn't play for the money he wins He don't play for respect  He deals the cards to find the answer The sacred geometry of chanceThe hidden law of a probable outcome The numbers lead a dance  I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart  He may play the jack of diamonds He may lay the queen of spades He may conceal a king in his hand While the memory of it fades  I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this artBut that's not the shape of my heart  And if I told you that I loved you You'd maybe think there's something wrong I'm not a man of too many faces The mask I wear is one  Well, those who speak know nothin' And find out to their cost Like those who curse their luck in too many places And those who fear are lost  I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart That's not the shape, the shape of my heart That's not the shape, the shape of my heart ",

            "answer_text": "Cole Porter's You're the Top is the perhaps the funniest, most clever, touching, love lyric ever. And it's exquisite with the music. There are more stanzas that he wrote for different productions and for the movie, but these seem to be what most performances include.   You're the TopIrving Berlin - 1934 At words poetic, I'm so pathetic That I always have found it best, Instead of getting 'em off my chest, To let 'em rest unexpressed.I hate parading my serenading As I'll probably miss a bar, But if this ditty is not so pretty At least it'll tell you How great you are.  You're the top! You're the Coliseum. You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum. You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss. You're a Bendel bonnet, A Shakespeare sonnet, You're Mickey Mouse. You're the Nile, You're the Tower of Pisa, You're the smile on the Mona Lisa. I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top!  Your words poetic are not pathetic. On the other hand, babe, you shine, And I can feel after every line A thrill divine down my spine. Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans Might think that your song is bad, But I got a notion I'll second the motion And this is what I'm going to add:  You're the top! You're Mahatma Gandhi. You're the top! You're Napoleon Brandy. You're the purple light Of a summer night in Spain, You're the National Gallery, You're Garbo's salary, You're cellophane. You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner, You're the time of a Derby winner I'm a toy balloon that\u2019s fated soon to pop, But if, baby, I'm the bottom, You're the top!  You're the top! You're an Arrow collar You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar. You're the nimble tread Of the feet of Fred Astaire, You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama, You're camembert.  You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,You're the nose On the great Durante. I'm just in a way, As the French would say, \"de trop.\" But if, baby, I'm the bottom, You're the top!  You're the top! You're a dance in Bali. You're the top! You're a hot tamale. You're an angel, you, Simply too, too, too diveen. You're a Boticcelli, You're Keats, You're Shelly! You're Ovaltine! You're a boom, You're the dam at Boulder, You're the moon, Over Mae West's shoulder. I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP! But if, baby, I'm the bottom, You're the top!  You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad. You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad. You're the boats that glide On the sleepy Zuider Zee, You're an old Dutch master, You're Lady Astor, You're broccoli! You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia, You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,  But if, baby, I'm the bottom, You're the top! ",
