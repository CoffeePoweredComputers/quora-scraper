            "answer_text": "Loss of energy, simpele physics. The natural state of the string is to do nothing. It vibraties because an external sources, your fingertip or a pick, applied force to it, transfering energy. Vibrating makes the string lose the energy, and we hear that as sound. So it uses up the energy and then it is silent again. ",

            "answer_text": "The primary reason is that the structure of the guitar absorbs the vibrational energy of the string and projects it outward in the form of sound waves. This causes the string to gradually stop vibrating. The rate at which that absorption occurs is called \u201csustain\u201d. ",
