            "answer_text": "I feel it necessary to give two answers to this question. Before I give my answers, which ultimately is just my opinion (for me, based off over 15 years working in the music industry as both a performer and from a production/technical standpoint, and all of the business politics that come with both sides of the spectrum) I ask that you do read through to understand my reasoning. The answer is YES and NO. Obviously this alone does not help, so let me explain. EDM is a very unique genre in many aspects. The music itself, in many cases, throws music theory out the window and many times has benefited by this and lead to some very original and creative approaches to music. For someone to become an EDM producer you do not need a large amount of monetary investment. Many of the biggest name producers started, and some still do, work entirely \u201din the box \u201cand out of a bedroom or hotel room. The genre is constantly evolving which has allowed for the enormous amount of \u201csub genres\u201d . Unlike other popular musical genres, EDM artists do not have a specific format or template that the business side feels necessary to have \u201csingles\u201d. On that note, the vast majority of the most successful EDM producers do not have or need \u201csingles\u201d in the traditional sense. Most are not on the radio. Selling albums is not a priority, and the community amongst producers is very collaborative and this is what I believe is the key to the enormous success that the genre has seen in recent years. For the most part there is still a very DIY approach ,even at the biggest levels, and major labels are more and more out of the picture. Now to your question. Theoretically if you have all of the knowledge, technical ability, necessary basic equipment to create a finished product , created a unique sound, have an understanding of the business, and most important TALENT, then the answer (again, theoretically) is NO. Technically anyone can call them selves an EDM producer, but I will assume for this answer we are talking \u201csuccessful EDM producer\u201d. Now here is the YES portion of the answer. Theoretical is the key part to my first answer. One would imagine if they had all of the skill and knowledge that goes into making a finished , well crafted , EDM song, has created a unique and likable sound and characteristic, as well as all the business savvy (or a great manager) and obviously talent, then you would think it would be a no brainer. But this is not always the case. Two factors are crucial if one finds success in electronic music and the music business in general for some of this. Absolute necessity, NONSTOP NETWORKING and LUCK. Because the genre is so unique in comparison to what the industry is used to, a huge benefit of this is the relevance of signing a record deal with a big label is no longer a priority or in many cases necessary at all. What has taken the place of many roles the label once played is NETWORKING with your fellow producers and artists. Because the tools needed to create are so much more accessible, and for the the most part you dont have a whole band to deal with, the market is flooded with \u201cproducers\u201d. Granted, in the end the truly talented and unique individuals shine, it is easy to become buried in the vast amounts of subpar and almost spam like quantities of bedroom producers. If one truly believes they have the talent and something really great to show the world , then the music will speak for itself. At this point focus needs to be on constantly keeping connected to fellow artist to get your music out there. Go to shows as many nights of the week as possible. Be confident and put yourself in situations to network with other artists. Many of the biggest names come up through the ranks together. As one producer gets buzz going , they will turn to their peers to find opening acts. Collaborate. If you like another producer, big or small, reach out and try and collaborate. Get your name on as much material being released as possible. It is sad the amount of amazing talent that will never be heard. I have worked with many artists, who both technically and just sheer talent, put the biggest names to shame, but they typically are introverted and do not network past the point of posting music online OR they are stuck in old thinking that signing a big label deal is the goal and all the focus is put in one place. More often then not (even with a deal) these artists will never be heard from again. This is where the LUCK part comes in. Unfortunately many times you may do everything right, you may have some fantastic songs, you may have true talent, but that chance meeting one night when you happened to sit next to Tiesto at the bar and you two hit it off, he listened to your music , likes it, you keep in touch, he works one of your tracks into his set , offers you an opening spot on a leg of a tour, and you network with everyone from artists to business people you are exposed to during this week, then keep in touch with everyone and continue to write music everyday during this entire time aswell\u2026and the rest is history. OR you post music online. You try to contact other artists, go to functions, try and stay involved with local and online music communities, you pass out cards and demos, you do everything you can think of, but you never have a chance meeting or your music never makes it into the right hands. That's just luck. (This is not to say there are exceptions. An artist I do a lot of work with started his career by uploading some songs online and just word of mouth rocketeted him to a management deal, opening slots, to a current state as one of the biggest EDM producers in the world. All in a few years. He is also unbelievably talented and has a scary good work ethic.) To sum it up, I am not sure if it is possible to answer your question in a black or white sense, but if we are talking about \u201csuccessful EDM producer\u201d, then absolutly yes. It is difficult and a lot of work . Both creative/artistic difficulties, the massive amount of technical knowledge past just music theory needed, and business related difficulties. My NO answer is purely theoretically and heavily relys on the information in the second part of your question. There are so many factors involved and every one is going to be unique to the individual. Never stop NETWORKING. Nurture those relationships regardless of what level others are at (you never know who will have a big break). You are never good enough, always continue to improve your craft. Take chances, get out of your comfort zone. The more chances you take, the more control you have over luck. And never never ever stop writing. Always continue writing new material. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not hard to become an EDM producer. All things being equal, EDM is an easy genre to grasp. The music isn\u2019t technically complex. There are many thousands of production tutorials on YouTube. With remixes and collaborations, you can call yourself a producer in a couple of months. You only need a laptop and a little effort. Is it hard to excel and stand out as a premier EDM producer? Yes. Longevity in EDM as a producer is about as hard as becoming a doctor or a lawyer. Going further, the likelihood of fame and fortune is similar to becoming a professional athlete or movie star. There simply aren\u2019t many job openings for high-profile EDM producers in the world. There are only a few dozen household names. EDM production is not a very likely avenue for success. But the journey might be worth it if you love the genre. ",
