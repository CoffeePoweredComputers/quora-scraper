            "answer_text": "Absolutely! The key to learning online in my opinion is a few things: Scheduled weekly time for digesting content so that you stick with it,Constrained practice activities so that you\u2019re forcing yourself to put the things you learn into action regularly,Seeking out feedback from friends or online communities.The key here is being disciplined so that you don\u2019t just watch a couple videos, then never do anything with the new knowledge you\u2019ve picked up. Effective learning takes \u201cactive\u201d engagement over a period of time. You can certainly do this via YouTube. There are some great videos from people like Rick Beato that will teach you a lot about composing. But you will need to be very disciplined to make sure you actually practice the things you\u2019re learning, because passively ingesting materials is not going to stick long-term. YouTube is great because it\u2019s free, but obviously that comes with certain drawbacks, including a lack of feedback, credibility issues, etc. At Soundfly (my site), we offer a mentor-based composition course that will pair you up with a composer to learn, help you stay on track, and offer feedback on your work. It\u2019s our attempt to help you stay disciplined and practice active learning while you learn. We have taught dozens of people to compose in this way (although it assumes some knowledge already such as how to read music). Otherwise, here are some other online schools worth considering: Coursera has a \u201cWrite Like Mozart\u201d course which is pretty good but assumes a decent amount of background knowledge and can be tough to keep up with.Berklee Online has composing courses although they are very expensive. But they are also quite in-depth and will offer feedback.Finally, Khan Academy has a couple music videos, although this has never really been a focus for them. But they can be fun to check out!I hope that helps! Come say hello to us over on Soundfly, if you\u2019re interested, and we can dive into more detail about your specific situation. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely yes, as I\u2019m an educator who teaches music composition 1-on-1 online and also offer a subscription-based membership for that exact purpose! One word of caution, though. If you are serious about making progress with your skills in music composition, I\u2019d try to find the sweet spot between the money that you spend and the value that you\u2019ll give. Some online courses are very cheap (around 20 EUR), others go up to 3,000 EUR. Both solutions can be frustrating as you don\u2019t know what the value is like that you\u2019ll get out of the courses. Therefore, I\u2019d start with a 1-on-1 session to get to know the teaching style of an educator and then decide, if you go with that course or not. Everybody is offering online courses nowadays and with many suppliers, the chance goes up that you meet a shady person who simply tries to make a quick buck. If you want to learn more about what I do, please have a look at the course page: Composition Course | Music Interval Theory Academy Our Academy teaches interval theory and how to use that to build musical confidence and boost your writing skills. So, it\u2019s not what you\u2019ll learn at conventional institutions. It\u2019s more efficient and leads to fresh results instead of old-fashioned sounds that nobody is going to hire you for :) \u2026 If you see value in what I teach, please feel free to reach out and I\u2019ll happily offer a 1-on-1 call via Zoom to give you more information about what interval theory is all about.
