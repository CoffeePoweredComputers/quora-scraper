            "answer_text": "Not all young people dislike Rock music, but a fair amount either don\u2019t like it or simply don\u2019t appreciate it, nor do they appreciate live performances of music. Why? A handful reasons contributed to it . . . They simply weren\u2019t raised to find music important. Before the internet & mainly before smartphones, listening to music & most importantly, purchasing recorded music & concert tickets was one of the only things to do and was a steady stream of income for music artists & record labels, which encouraged the labels to seek good new talent & encouraged people who were musically inclined to consider a music career vs finishing college & getting a degree & working weekdays. Then illegal downloading usurped profits & what music buyers left were only buying songs one at a time, plus the incredible fragmenting of the market makes it difficult to sell a product to a mass market anymore. This is yet another reason why free enterprise/capitalism works.Since the early 80\u2019s Rock music\u2019s inherent quality, i.e., the talent it takes to create what\u2019s popular has steadily declined. Rock went from being a melodic genre with harmony vocals, usually keyboards included, and a lot of dexterity needed in the 60\u2019s & 70\u2019s, to being a 3 or 4-chord rock song with just guitar, bass & drums & little if anything else by the mid 80\u2019s with the advent of Glam Metal Hair Bands, then it got even easier to play when Grunge hit in the 90\u2019s as they eschewed the guitar solo & used little if any harmonies.Millennials (and their younger siblings who mostly make up the masses that aren\u2019t listening to or appreciating Rock music anymore) don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time honing a musical talent as they have plenty of other things that are faster to do & interest them more. For the few who choose to practice music, they are more into learning a number of chords on guitar quickly in order to accompany themselves singing because of shows like American Idol & The Voice where vocal talent is appreciated & prized way more than instrumental talent. This is almost a retro throwback to the early 70\u2019s, except that they\u2019re not as talented as that bunch. They also prefer entertainment that makes -them- the star instead of watching & appreciating others, such as karaoke, or electronic club music that allows them to be the star on the dance floor. The music bows to them rather than the other way around.This list could go on and on and on . . .",

            "answer_text": "Some very good answers here, especially Chuck Beikert\u2019s. But here\u2019s something I don\u2019t hear too much about: technology advances. In the 70s, entertainment choices and accessibility were very different. Television: we had five or six channels. No VCRs. Cable? If you\u2019re rich, maybe. My point is, you had limited choices in programming and you had to be home when it came on. Movies: Again, no VCRs. If you wanted to see a movie, you had to truck on down to the theater and wait in line. Kids today line up for the newest Stars Wars films and go see it multiple times because they want to. But in 1977, we waited in lines round the block and saw it multiple times because we HAD to. The theatre was it. Sure it would probably be on TV in three years or so, but until then, you had to go to the theater. Telephones: All you could was talk on the telephone. I know, crazy, right? And you had to be at HOME to do it. Video Games: For the more advanced video games you had to go to the arcade or 7\u201311 or whatever. OK, at home we did have the Atari, sure. (Pong, MAN! Soooooooo exciting!) Books: Now books are portable of course, sure. But you couldn\u2019t read one while driving, or at your job. Music: (The 70s) Again, FM car radios were for the wealthy at the time. AM was readily availalbe though. But other than that, music was highly portable. Everyone in the family could have a radio or turntable in their rooms to spin Rumours or Hotel California or Boston or Frampton Comes Alive! The 80s: Portability took a big leap forward with the creation of the \u201cboombox\u201d and the Sony Walkman. Vinyl faded out and cassettes came in to play. Now car manufacturers made FM radio and cassette players in cars almost automatic. And then CDs made their debut. So for three or four decades, music had the upper hand as far as being the most portable form of entertainment. At home, at your job, in the car, on vacation, whatever, you could take your music with you anywhere, like you couldn\u2019t do for anything else. You know what happened next. The Internet. Gameboy. Sony Playstation. Blockbuster Video. Cable. Satellite. DVDs. Books on Tape. The iPod. Wi-Fi. Smartphones. X-Box. Netflix. And on and on and on. Music no longer has that technological advantage. It\u2019s gone, vanished, disappeared, *poof!*. So therefore, music is no longer central to the lives of the young people who don\u2019t know a world without smart phones. What IS central to them are Facebook and Snapchat and whatever else. Tons of entertainment options are available to them at their fingertips. There\u2019s lots of kids who aren\u2019t listening to anything at all. Women, girls especially are spending much of their free time on their phones talking. For hours. Boys spend much of their free time on video games. For hours. So I don\u2019t know how old the OP of this question is, or the average age of those asking \u201cWhat Happened To Rock And Roll?\u201d which seems to get asked 20 times a day on Quora, but basically if you grew up in the 70s or 80s, you have to forget everything you used to know as kids today process entertainment differently than we did back then.
