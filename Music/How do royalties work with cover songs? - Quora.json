            "answer_text": "Mechanical licenses are based on amount of CDs you press or the amount of Downloads you get from Amazon or iTunes. It\u2019s billed at 9.1 cents per CD or download. There is a smaller rate for streaming. (Sometimes there is a 1,000 unit or higher minimum ($91+per song). In the case of a synchronization license to make a video of the song or to put the song in a motion pictures or TV show, this is negotiated directly with the Publisher of the song. They generally run in the thousands of dollars depending on the type of use and budget or the negotiations between the publisher and user. YouTube has bulk sync licenses with most (not all) publishers so your cover tune videos generally don\u2019t need a separate license ON YOUTUBE and only on YOUTUBE. In the case of Publishing Administers they get 10% and 90% goes to the songwriters. In the case of a full publisher they split 50/50 with the songwriters. All these license fees go DIRECTLY to the Publisher who then pays the songwriters based on the terms of the contract. In the case of Radio or TV airplay the song has to be LOGGED. ALL TV is logged in America but radio is 1% by ASCAP and 10% by BMI and the song title has to show up on a log (in the UK the BBC is logged 100%). Then the Publisher gets 50% and the songwriters SEPARATELY get 50% directly from the Performance Rights Org they belong to (ASCAP and BMI in America and PRS in the UK). In the case of the ORIGINAL recording (and not the cover) the Publisher gets the same as all of the above PLUS the Record Label has to giver permission and gets a fee that they split with the artist based on the contract. In some instances the recording artist must also give permission or can stop a use (such as a TV commercial). ",

The fee is then distributed by ASCAP or BMI to the person or entity who owns the publishing rights for the music/lyrics, and also to the performing artists for that particular version of the song. All of that info has been submitted to ASCAP or BMI before the song was distributed. ",
