            "answer_text": "After hours trading occurs, and so do events. The closing price is only the price that was in effect during the last transaction of the day when a buyer and seller agreed on a price, say $100 per share. Now let\u2019s suppose that during the night the XYZ company was found to have been selling fraudulent cures for cancer or aircraft that crash soon after taking to the air. As soon as that news is out, people cancel their buy orders at $100, and the buy orders at $80, $60, $40. The only guy who didn\u2019t cancel his orders had a buy order in at $3/share. Next morning, you have a choice if you want to sell: Accept the $3 bid, or don\u2019t sell. No other choices are possible. WHAT WILL YOU DO? Enough people will accept the $3 that the price drops from $100 to $3. That\u2019s the way the market works. ",

            "answer_text": "Stock prices constantly change based on the laws of supply and demand. New information doesn't care if the market is closed or not, it just comes out arbitrarily. When new information surfaces that creates an imbalance in supply and demand and traders make transactions on the market until a new balance is found, and the process repeats. Many stocks even move when the market is closed, as traders revalue what a stock is worth to them and transact on that figure, which is why some days stocks open with a gap higher or lower, and it can be significant. The purpose of the market is to facilitate transactions and liquidity between traders, not to value the price of a stock. Value is based on supply and demand, which is then measured by the price on the market. Hope this helps. ",
