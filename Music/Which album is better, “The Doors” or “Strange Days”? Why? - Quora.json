            "answer_text": "Both are brilliant albums with so many classic rock songs. I like the flow of \u201cStrange days\u201d more due to a remarkable consistency that holds it together with one track literally blending into the subsequent one with a cohesion that is brilliant in and of itself. Both albums have some of their greatest songs. \u201cThe Doors\u201d has the all time sensational \u201cBreak on through\u201d, \u201cCrystal ship\u201d, \u201cSoul kitchen\u201d, \u201cBackdoor man\u201d, and the two masterpieces, namely \u201cLight my fire\u201d, and \u201cThe end\u201d. Their second album \u201c\u201cStrange days\u201d has the following classics : \u201cStrange days\u201d, \u201cPeople are strange\u201d, \u201cLove me two times\u201d, \u201cMy eyes have seen you\u201d, \u201cHorse latitudes\u201d, \u201cMoonlight drive\u201d the melodramatic rare and underappreciated masterpiece \u201cI can\u2019t see your face in my mind\u201d and the incomparable psychedelic rock masterpiece \u201cWhen the music\u2019s over\u201d. Both albums are timeless in their appeal\u2026 KT ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking Camden. I suppose \u201cThe Doors\u201d is higher ranked. Simply because it's a magnificent debut and have some great classic tunes on it. Over the years i like Strange Days a bit better. The producing is better than the debut and for me the songs sounds more natural in a way. In popmusic there's always such a thing about \u201c The Diffecult Second Album\" and always a bit pressure to do it better than the first one. Strange Days is a great follow up and it seemed like The Doors had lots of inspiration for the years after this. It's maybe a piece that is not full of highlights, but as a total piece it works amazing. I can't really tell what's the best album is. The later Doors years, when the group go forward in a blues rock direction, is also very good. But Strange Days is my favorite. ",
