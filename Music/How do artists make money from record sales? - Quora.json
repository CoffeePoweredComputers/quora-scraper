            "answer_text": "It used to be that record stores bought the records, so then youd have to sell them off shelves and buy more and the record label would just earn each batch they sold. But i think in the 70s or 80s major labels started making deals with record stores, essentially lending them the stock and splitting parts instead of selling the actual album to them first, that way they dont take that much risk and the label gets to ask for a bigger cut and control over the sales, price etc. Thats why sometimes when theres an amazon sale it is only universal artists that participate. So the actual collecting is done by a licencing and distribution agency, but most big labels have their own, so regarding major labels its just the label thw one who collects the money. The distributer takes a percentage fee, then the owner of the actual recording (the label) usually takes the bigger part (or all of it) if the production has not yet been paid for and then the writers and composers get their cut (most top 10 artists dont really write their own music) the base percentages are set before the recording process. Also some producers, ghost writers and engineers tend to ask for a percentage of royalties nowadays (like 1 or 2%) so they always get their part regardless of if the label got its money back but the main artist usually has to wait until the investment returns to get their full cut and they basically get the money in a monthly or other time based manner automatically, thats what the distribution agency's work is, to sort everything out so that they just contact the manager and the artist doesnt have to worry about that Oh and btw this is if youre a small artist with a 360 contract, if youre michael jackson you can get whatever you want if you give the label at least 20% lol I dont work for a mayor label but this was explained to me by some teachers that work for universal and a teacher who is an expert lawyer in copyright law in my country so it may not be exactlu the same although i do believe this is how it works in the us, because in my country it is a little bit different and thats how i remember it being over there ",

            "answer_text": "Artists make money from record sales through their artist agreement. Most agreement have a clause that the artist gets a percentage of sales. This will vary depending on their status. New artists will get 1% - 3%. Established artists might get 3 or 4%. Highly successful artist could get 5 to 7%. Now, they still have to pay for several miscellaneous costs surrounding the album release and the tour support of that album, which comes out of the gross dollars collected for album sales and tour fees, so you make a million dollars on the tour and record sales, you pay the bill that is about 35% of the gross dollars, that leaves $650,000. At 3%, you get $19,500. Usually, the artist got a huge advance, so if you make enough money to recoup that advance, you then start getting paid. The process starts all over again with the next album. Hope this is helpful! Markd ",
