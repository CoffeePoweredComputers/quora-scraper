            "answer_text": "None ever did. COVID-19, a fake meme that originated in Wuhan, China with US CDC funding and flooded through the world media by WHO, is fraudulent claims by Neil Ferguson predicting that 2 million Americans and 500,000 Brits will die from the novel betacoronavirus before he withdrew the claim but not before governments adopted as basis for strict lock down policy. Every civil restriction, every mandatory surgical mask demand, are adopted from a retracted paper; non-reviewed prepublication fraudulent junk science from Imperial College and Lancet. COVID-19 is a false belief held by 99% of the world\u2019s population that the deadliest ever germ in history is circulating throughout all of habitable civilization. Countering the meme are scientists with decades of experience and repute, department heads, stating they have found no conclusive evidence of any novel virus causing acute respiratory distress syndrome or even ARDS in alleged COVID-19 deaths of nearly all octogenarian and older with existing multiple chronic illnesses. No viral pneumonia or viral RNA discovered. The 80\u201390 year old mortalities claimed to be COVID-19 are cancer, heart disease, renal and liver failure of elderly at end of life, the worst regions being in long-term high to dangerous level industrial smog. Most people are conditioned to unquestionably believe every word from MDs and, of all the incredulous errors, the media. Scientists do the opposite. They take claims under consideration and subject to rigorous test to determine accuracy or lack of. Department heads are declaring COVID-19 criminal fraud. If this alleged pathogen were real, you would know it. Not unlike a major earthquake or tsunami, the destruction and devastation would be unmistakable. Every day one would receive news of someone they know or know of, healthy up until, stricken and rapidly dying from pneumonia, all across the human spectrum from family, friends, acquaintances, famous athletes, actors, politicians, musicians, poor, wealthy, in between. None of this has happened. The tsunami warning was issued, no waves made shore. All of the hundreds of millions around the world in absolutely useless surgical masks that each manufacturer disclaims as incapable of blocking germs, being cattle herded by store security, fully believing surrounded by deadly germs have no idea that they are the virus in the eyes of the frauds behind the invention and marketing of COVID-19. Every civil restriction, revocation of fundamental liberties, so much for D-Day, are to psychologically beat down into docile consumer sheep by nurturing and pressuring populations into hopelessless, confusion and fear. Where once people could freely walk into places of businesses, are being forcibly contained and herded. The lock down and \u201csocial distancing\u201d scams have no association with disease prevention from an alleged pathogen with zero scientific evidence to support. The restrictions are population control to break down human will; force business insolvency, personal bankruptcy, domestic abuse, suicide, disperse the rising tide of public protest against crooked government. And it works beautifully as the inventors know that most people are that naive, ignorant and gullible to eat up every word. Being forced outside a grocery store to stand on a 6\u2032 marker in a useless mask, waiting for some uniformed security guard to admit inside, is about snuffing out the human spirit and turning people into frightened sheep, much of which that already were. The only \u2018herd mentality\u2019 at work, and working to plan, are the ignorant and naive observing a sea of surgical masks from their 6\u2032 dot or line believing that a deadly germ abounds from the immediate presentation and reinforcing visage of ignorant, naive, irrational humans behaving as the predictable sheeple most are. Nearly all animal disease, unless shot, stabbed, beaten, poisoned, asphyxiated, is internal human cell breakdown from cell differentiation, vascular plaque buildup, congenital defect or bacterial imbalance. Humans who die from natural causes die from the biological flaw of cells to fail to replicate or cells starved of vital nutrients and energy and die as a result. No human has ever been beset and destroyed but what are called viruses, which are all made by animal or plant cell with the host\u2019s genetic and structural material. The term \u2018virus\u2019, a very recent inclusion, through huge expenditure and promotion, has convinced the human race to be terrified of or regard as icky and gross, when are 100% natural cell process for host animal or plant benefit. Most people, being scientifically ignorant and naive, do not know that a fragment of RNA, if even did originate from a real deadly pathogen, could never negatively affect any human of any age or immune system integrity. A partial RNA sequence is too tiny to cause any trouble. In their ignorance and naivete, all it takes is one MD of perceived authority and repute to claim that some partial fragment of RNA poses a decisive threat to their health to believe every word, because that is how, from being ignorant, are conditioned to react. There is no such thing as even one human COVID-19 case. Only the duped presumption. ",

            "answer_text": "Coronavirus will never, ever be over, just like Influenza will never, ever be over. Since that fateful day when somebody in Wuhan decided to snack on a bat, or a snake, or a wolf or whatever it was, the course of history was changed forever. The Coronavirus as we know it has found a good host. And when a virus finds a good host, it is part of the host species\u2019 existence forever. It appears that this Coronavirus is very adept at mutation, which is how it got to humans in the first place. So no matter what vaccination is brought out, Coronavirus will circumvent it with mutation, just like the \u2018flu does. However, and this is the important point, every day it becomes more and more likely that the danger of the virus is massively overestimated. The reported death rates of 3% are clearly massively overestimated. It\u2019s now thought that there are tens of thousands of unreported cases of Coronvirus around the world. Remember, 100% of deaths caused by the virus are reported, but the amount of people who are carrying the virus is unknown, and the reports are based on the worst possible scenario. When we look at the deaths, we have to look at where the deaths have occurred. Wuhan was hit pretty hard, but 70% of the male population are heavy smokers, and they live in the some of the worst air pollution in the world. It won\u2019t take much to put these people into respiratory distress. Then there\u2019s Italy. The people that have succumbed have been elderly, since the elderly will not have access to social media like the young have, and villages of old biddies will get together for Sunday mass and a cup of coffee. Then there\u2019s counties like the UK and Australia where the deaths are occurring in nursing homes. The remaining life expectancy in nursing homes is months, and patients are way more likely to die of aspirational pneumonia from inadequate oral hygiene. But the fact is, only a handful of people have been tested. In America it is around 500, in Australia it is no more than 100, and a diagnosis cannot be made without a test. So just think of all the undiagnosed cases that bring the death rate down. The fact is that this is just my opinion, and nobody knows the truth just yet. It is the fear of the unknown that is worse for many people. Edit: It appears that some people haven\u2019t read the last paragraph. It is my opinion. You\u2019re welcome to yours, even if it differs from mine. But if you start getting all angry and insulting and are unable to keep your emotions in check, you\u2019ll just get your comment deleted and get blocked. Be nice people, it\u2019s free. Edit 2: The first line isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s a scientific fact. If your mind works that way, that\u2019s a shame for you, but don\u2019t assume that everybody else\u2019s does. ",

            "answer_text": "Let us be very realistic. The COVID virus will NOT end in any near future. I have drawn some reasonable conclusions based on some understanding of viruses and epidemics. I will not be too technical as it hardly adds much to the appreciation of huge capability of nature. What is COVID-19? Covid-19 is the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 virus. This virus has shown itself to be very contagious with short incubation period in humans. The pandemic however will end as you will be able to appreciate when you get some idea about the virus and some of its prominent properties. You will however continue to get sporadic outbreaks with possibly seasonal patterns. You can not have reliable vaccine as in small pox and polio. The COVID is caused by an RNA virus and likes to mutate quiet comfortably. The treatment in terms of cure is elusive. The worst of its aggression will tone down after taking the toll of hundreds of thousands of elderly and twisting the world economy like never before. This may take around six months. Humans would then learn to live with this virus like a nasty flu bug which will hit them every season. Those with comorbidities will continue to pay heavier price . What is SARS-COV-2 virus? Let us now have a very brief glimpse of this virus. It belongs to the family of virus known as Corona virus. Perhaps it was happily living in some exotic creatures and ended up unwittingly in a human host as humans are pretty much like cockroaches when it comes to food habits. It did not mean to be so aggressive and was happily living in the previous natural host. In the humans it found it easy to multiply and spread largely through contact. It has shown itself to be highly contagious. The other frightful but very real possibility is that humans were playing with these known virus which includes gene splicing and addition. The virus could have escaped the facility through any of these humans getting accidently infected. (added this paragraph after reading a fair amount). This likelyhood is a perfect setting for some conspiracy theory and a blockbuster! The preventive measure of social distance, masks and hand wash is related to this aspect. The effect of this virus. I will not go into various manifestations of the disease itself but look at its basic behaviour. The virus has entered the new host in humans. Unfortunately this new host (human) found the virus more uncomfortable leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Some mutation perhaps took place and more would be in the pipeline. This mutation can make it more aggressive or less aggressive. The second prospect is a preferable behaviour from the viewpoint of the parasite. There is no point being so vicious that you kill your host when you can not survive outside your prey. This is evolutionary and follows the rules of survival. Vast majority of those infected will survive the infection and build some degree of immunity. Those who do not survive are largely elderly or those with some preexisting comorbidities. Perhaps classic survival of the fittest in its raw form. The suggestion of regular exercise, healthy eating and lifestyle changes to improve your basic health and hence the immunity are therefore stressed. The impact on policy makers and think tanks. The think tanks of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump considered that as a preferred option. They were hoping for some mortality over a long period and were prepared for this. The economic argument made sense. However the thinkers got one tiny aspect wrong. The virus turned out to be rather too aggressive with short incubation period taking serious toll on the senior citizens. Italy and Spain showed how crazy it could get, overwhelming the health service. UK and USA had to lock down. This is a bit late but better late than never. The idea was that a gradual spread would take place, which allows the health service to cope with best of its facilities. This would go on for years and largely have serious effect on the elderly. In economic terms this is more acceptable. The herd immunity would develop and we will benefit with one more variety of flu bug to choose! The Covid virus will not end but humans will learn to live with it by sacrificing those with reduced ability to fight while the majority of the rest develop some immunity. Every season we should expect a few thousands to depart their bodies for years to come due to their losing battle with SARS-CoV-2 virus. What is in store? Drugs and vaccines are long way off in terms of cure or prophylaxis. There are drugs that do help in recovery of clogged lungs but they do NOT kill the virus. It is the body's immune system that does the actual task of fighting the invader. Drugs are likely to help, only up to an extent, once available widely. Rapid mutations makes vaccines hard to be of great efficiency and hence to be of great use. It remains to be seen if hot weather, humidity and sunshine helps to limit its spread. Poorer nations and those with fragile economies would otherwise pay a huge price. The understanding of the world as we know, was made up of relentless pursuit of wealth regardless of the means. This will be questioned for a while. Expect things to go back as usual in a few years, followed by a plus version of COVID in due course! It is not the end of the world though humans overestimate their ability and importance in the grand scheme of universe! Humans are totally expendable when nature decides it had enough. Points to ponder Live with due respect with the nature and the odds are humans will lead a happier and healthier life and perhaps longer as well. This statement may have a spiritual or a philosophical leaning but that can easily be backed by some boring studies:) We have silently watched nature being ravaged indiscriminately by humans. It is easy to be a bit cynical about humans who like to think they know best! Sadly the silent majority has to pay the price. The minority who make the noises are of little impact. Perhaps that is natural as well! Added 10.06.20 \u2018We have disrespected animals and disrespected the environment\u2019 \u2013 Dame Jane Goodall on coronavirus ",

            "answer_text": "Several months ago a highly infectious, sometimes deadly respiratory virus, COVID-19 infected humans. It then proliferated faster than public health measures could contain it. Now, the WHO has declared the pandemic. Pandemic means it is spreading worldwide. Due to the social-psychological issue of exhaustion and frustration, people want to go back to their regular life. Everyone has the same question - \u201cWhen will this pandemic end ?\u201d Some historians believe that pandemic has two types of endings - Social ending - When the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes. In this ending, end occurs not because the disease has been vanquished, but because people grow tired of the panic mode and learn to live with a disease.Medical ending - When incidence and death rates plummet.The WHO will declare the pandemic over, once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop significantly throughout the world. But exactly when that happens depends on what global governments choose to do next. There are three ways to deal with the pandemic. Race through it - It is widely considered best and it may not be the one you think.Delay and Vaccinate.Coordinate and Crush.In the first option, there are no quarantine and social distancing norms. The Government will allow people to be exposed as quickly as possible. This will lead to peak capacity in the hospitals almost immediately. There will be millions of deaths, either from the virus or the collapse of the health care system. The majority of the population will be infected in this case. Some perished and some survived by building up their immune response. Around this point, the herd community kicks in, where the virus can no longer find new hosts. So the pandemic frizzles out in a short time after it began. It is a quick fix, but a global catastrophe, and also it may not work at all if people can be reinfected. In the second option, the Government imposes full lockdown in the containment zones and emphasizes strict social distancing norms. This will slow down the spread and give research facilities time to develop a vaccine. This time can be used for widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected and people they\u2019ve interacted with. These measures can slow down the death toll. Some cities get the outbreak under the control and go back to usual regular life, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing when a new case passes through. Within the next few years, one or possibly several vaccines become widely, and hopefully freely available. Once 40\u201390% of the population has received it, then herd immunity kicks in and the pandemic fizzles out. Ultimately, vaccination assisted by as much global cooperation is the winner. This is the slow, steady, and proven option. In the last option, the idea is to simultaneously starve the virus, everywhere through a combination of quarantine social distancing, and restricting travel. The critical factor is to synchronize responses. In a pandemic, when one country is peaking, another may be getting its first case. Instead of separate governments dealing with what\u2019s happening in their territory, here everyone must treat the world as a giant interconnected system. With full coordination, this method can end pandemic within a few months, with low loss of life. If the virus is not completely eradicated(which is highly unlikely), then the situation can again escalate to the pandemic level once again. So, this method is only reliable with true and nearly impossible global cooperation. Due to economic catastrophe wreaked by lockdown, some states have lifted restrictions. The end-game of COVID-19 will involve a mix of efforts that stopped historic outbreaks: social-control measures, medication, and vaccine. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody really knows when will COVID-19 stop. However, here is an idea that I would like to propose based on my personal experience. Today, I was on a call with a close relative of mine. She told me that some of their relatives from different localities have assembled at her home, playing cards to socialize and pass time during the lockdown. Now, obviously, it is an extremely wrong thing to do because it defeats the whole purpose of a lockdown and puts everyone else at risk. If this continues, we won't be able to control the spread of the disease. On further talking to her, I realized that she and her family hardly have any knowledge about COVID-19 and how it spreads. I had a long 20-minute call with her where I explained to her why social distancing is important, why an overwhelmed healthcare system is the reason for deaths in Italy and why her actions are putting their parents and children at a huge risk. She realized that she was completely unaware of any such COVID-19 prevention measures. All she knew was it is just another flu-like disease that won\u2019t impact her much. She has requested me to spend time explaining her family the same thing tomorrow. Did you observe anything? People are not careless. They just lack awareness. Keeping this in mind, I am starting a campaign #educatePeopleAboutCorona wherein I will make 4 such calls on a daily basis to educate my other relatives or friends who lack Coronavirus-related awareness. I will further ask them to educate 4 others. If 2 out of 4 agree and explain to 4 others, and the chain continues, in just 10 days, more than 2,000 people would be educated about COVID-19. It is the bare minimum that we as an educated person can do to stop the spread of COVID-19. Here are the 4 key pieces of information we need to clearly convey: COVID-19 is especially dangerous for those who are above 60 years of age because of reduced immunity.People who are not coughing or feverish can still be infected because at times it takes 14 days for the symptoms to show up. These people, however, can still infect others.A large number of people in Italy died primarily because the Healthcare system did not have the capacity to serve so many patients. Our country will also face the same issue if the disease spreads because we also have a limited Healthcare capacity.The way to control the disease from spreading is to stay at your home and do not go out. It will work only when all of us follow this philosophy.Support me in this initiative. #educatePeopleAboutCorona ",

            "answer_text": "Epidemics end in one of three ways: 1- Everyone who can get infected gets infected (see Black Death in Medieval Europe, Smallpox in Age of Exploration Americas, Spanish Flu in 1918\u20131920) 2- Government action finds everyone who is sick, quarantines them, and prevents further spreading (see Wuhan China, 2020, SARS in China In 2002, Ebola in West Africa, 2018) 3- Transmission slows in warm/dry weather (see influenza, every year) We don\u2019t know yet if Covid-19 will slow down when the Northern Hemisphere turns to Spring. Right now China is succeeding at #2, South Korea is trying, and rumor has it Italy will quarantine the North soon, but the rest of Europe and United States are experiencing uncontrolled outbreaks. Worst case is like Spanish flu, Covid-19 continues to spread throughout 2020, perhaps with a lull in the Summer, then continues on into 2021 until everyone has been exposed. So far for most people who have caught the virus, it\u2019s just another cold. Unfortunately for 2%-3.4%, it\u2019s deadly. UPDATE: March 13, 2020\u2026 #4 from a thread in the comments: 4- Vaccine and/or treatment. It is possible a vaccine or treatment is found before everyone is infected. This doesn\u2019t look likely given how long medical trials typically take, but these are not typical times. In this past week of research while worrying about family (who are luckily not sick enough to be in a hospital but unluckily enough living in the U.S. where tests are not available unless you are in critical condition in a hospital), I\u2019ve been sharing my analysis on https://lunarmobiscuit.com/category/pandemic/. The news from the CDC is that the U.S. is headed down path #1, with projections of between 160 million and 250 million people infected, with an estimated 1% mortality rate. UPDATE: June 2, 2020 What we\u2019ve learned is that pandemic isn\u2019t going to end the same way everywhere. China, South Korea, and New Zealand managed to use option 2. Australia and Germany and a host of other countries are doing their best to follow that path. Meanwhile, the pandemic starting growing in India, Indonesia, Africa, and the half of the world where the majority of population lives in poverty. Those governments have tried to impose lockdowns, but the majority of people need to work to eat, and without tools like refrigeration, they need to shop every few days, not every two weeks. These countries, like it or not, are headed down option 1. More on that on Pandemic 2020: Next Up, Africa. With that, it looks like half the world will be locked down on and off until a vaccine arrives, and the other half will show how bad the disease can be when it grows as fast as it wants. Tragic, but it is now far too late to stop this outcome. ",

            "answer_text": "The most similar pandemic in modern times was the 1918 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza. It starter in 1916 and 1917 as minor local outbreaks in southern China. It moved to Europe with Chinese laborers who were brought in to dig trenches during World War I. It rapidly spread globally with the massive movements of people that were associated with the war. Military camps and schools tended to be massive hotspots of infection. The flu remained for four more years, 1918 - 1921, and apparently mutated into a more virulent for, during this period. It went around the world, with significant seasonality, in 22 detectable waves. It killed a likely 130 million people worldwide and around 1.2 million in the US alone, based on modern examination of \u201cexcess deaths.\u201d COVID-19 is similar in infectiousness to the \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d but has significantly less seasonality. It has mutated once already into a more virulent strain. (The one in China was less severe than the strain that emerged in Europe.) In 1916, scientists did not even know what a virus was. Some thought it was just another form of bacterial pneumonia, others thought it was a very tiny bacteria, and still others thought it was a toxic chemical. They also did not know how to treat it. Physicians and hospitals had never seen a disease there a person went to bed feeling well, arose with flu symptoms and was dead by nightfall. They had little time to learn about it or to try different treatments. Both hydration and mechanical respiratory support were virtually unknown at the time. The 1918 Flu ended, not when herd immunity was achieved, but when another strain of the influenza (H1N5) become dominant. A significant number of people had immunity to that strain and it literally shouldered the H1N1 virus out of the biome. Based on all we know about viruses and vaccines, a vaccine is likely not forthcoming for some time, likely years. The highly touted Oxford and Moderna vaccines are highly unlikely as examples. The Oxford vaccine candidate appears to provide only some protection for the lungs of monkeys, but does not eliminate the virus or its infectiousness. The Moderna vaccine is a totally new approach to vaccines (mRNA) based on a completely new concept. While intensively hyped in the media, just after the last undocumented announcement of \u201cprogress\u201d Moderna executives dumped $30 million in Moderna stock. This is not something you do when you have a blockbuster vaccine forthcoming. Remember all those cancer cures that have never come to pass? That is where we are with a vaccine today \u2014- all hype and few results. Some points for consideration \u2014- the average time to develop a new vaccine is 10.1 years. There are around 2,000 different known viruses in a human body at any given time. Over 200 of them are known to harm humans. We only have safe and effective vaccines for around ten, so-so vaccines for another five, and barely adequate vaccines for another dozen or so. That is a dismal record when you consider that the world has been working on vaccines since the 1500\u2019s. We have been searching for a SARS-CoV vaccine since 2002 and a MERS-CoV vaccine since 2010 and have not found either or even a likely candidate vaccine. At this point it looks like COVID-19 will be around for years. This will require massive planning to both allow for economic viability and protection of people, especially the most vulnerable among us. So far, none of this planning is being undertaken. None! Instead we are focusing entirely on the long-shot possibility of a vaccine and on rushed re-opening of the economy with no regard for the cost in human lives. It is not a pretty picture. ",

            "answer_text": "I am writing NOT to tell you when the Covid-19 will end (maybe it will never, when it ends up joining the tens of pathogens that afflict millions each year), BUT to tell you how you could refrain from catching one , or for that matter, any other pathogen in existence. It ends when every human on earth takes full responsibility of his/her personal hygiene seriously, and at the same time, adopts and puts to practice a comprehensive set of common-sense personal protective measures (PPM). Preconditions to make it a worldwide success, as follows: MENTALLY\u2026CHANGING THE MINDSET: First and foremost, you need to adopt the right mindset, realizing and admitting that it is your responsibility, as an individual and as a member of the community, to adhere to a workable series of personal / public hygiene measures. Government and health organization can help a lot, but ultimately you and you alone are your number-one life protector. Getting sick is no accident. But if you need to find someone to take the blame, how about putting it on yourself first ? PHYSICALLY\u2026 INTERNALIZING A SET OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES Noted that the mainstream media are flooded with news focusing on how the government should do to save the economy and the people, but little airtime has been dedicated to giving education on the how-to on self-protect and self-save techniques (and let it sink-in with continuous,repeating broadcasts). I have been tracking the social media, for the last 90 days or so, on self-help measures, more often than not, I come across new tricks and ideas discovered and shared by people that always surprise me. It proves one thing , I am still very distant from or naive about the \u2018know\u2019 that most of us refer to, and take it for granted, as the \u2018common-sense\u2019. I really wish that such vital life-saving \u2018common sense\u2019 advice could be found in one concise place readily available and easily accessible by the general public, and in particular for the elderly, say, through word of mouth (as they are not the fortunate majorities who are able to get the needed info from the internet at ease). To cite a few examples of what I have learned: (1) Whenever you come home, after finishing the essential runs outside, you may bring home the virus unwittingly, the carrier: what you wear, and your purchases . The virus can survive on surfaces of materials for up to a few days depending on the temperature, humidity and surface texture. To keep you safe and protected, one key advice is: ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, wash your hands before touching your face (eyes, nose and mouth), ANYwhere and ANYtime. If you have a habit of touching your face as a natural reflex, wear something over your face, bandana or the like, so you won\u2019t fall victim to your bad habit. Studies show that an average person touches his/her face more than 90 times a day. Also, you may touch your face inadvertently when in sleep, so do wash your hands before going to bed and keep your bed and pyjamas clean and clear of contamination. (2) hand cleaning: (this is the standard practice adopted by healthcare providers all over the world, by the way, be sure to wash your wrists too)  (3) the use of ordinary soap and water: (no need for hoarding of expensive liquid disinfectant)  (4) Don\u2019t ever spray disinfectant (alcohol content 60% plus) in a closed environment, in particular inside a vehicle with window shut. Flash fire can kill when triggered by static electricity or someone lighting a cigarette. Remember the \u201cDo not Smoke\u201d sign at gas stations. (5) Don\u2019t get near the stove or open fire when your hands are still wet with disinfectant. Your hands will catch fire. Make sure the disinfectant dries thoroughly before going into the kitchen. (6) Touching habit to change:  (7) Take heeds of the advice from Walt Disney and Kleenex, a 1951 production:  Wearing a facial shield of some sort( surgical mask, or even a bandana) can go a long way in stopping the spread (preventing cross-transmission). Some people say there is no evidence that face mask works in preventing contagion. But my answer to those experts or politicians is: common sense needs no science for approval. Moreover, surgical masks have been widely used in healthcare settings, if they don\u2019t work in preventing cross-contamination, the mask-wearing practice should have been abandoned long time ago. Denying that it is helpful is one thing and refusing to face the challenge of a shortage is another. Wearing a face shield can prevent one from spilling droplets when talking, coughing or sneezing. Of course you may say that you have not caught it, but remember that there are cases when the infected shows little or no sign of symptoms (asymptomatic carrier). So in the midst of this pandemic, always wear a face shield (a mask, or the like) when inside (being with your families), and when outside (at school, work, shopping or social gathering). Note that if everyone wears a mask when meeting people, there is no chance that the droplets will come flying into each other\u2019s face. We can go out to meet people again, like normal, as we have adopted a mutually-protective ( non-intrusive) measure, mask wearing. Its effectiveness could overshadow such public restrictive measures as 14/21-day stay-home quarantine, border closure, area lockdown, school/work place closing, 6-ft distancing and group gathering limiting to 2 to 5 people. Ironically, as for the latter, my question: How can it be enforced for the majority households with 2 or more family members?  All in all, to keep yourself and others safe, take ownership of the strive-for-survival mission in your own hands and carry out effective personal protective measures. It will definitely protect and preserve lives, yours and others. Winning or losing this pandemic war, now, the destiny is in your own hands. ",

            "answer_text": "It's impossible to say with any degree of certainty just how long the COVID-19 pandemic that took the world by storm in early 2020 will last. There are two ways to describe an 'end' to a plague. One is elimination, which is a reduction of new cases to a suitably low number (preferably zero). The other is eradication - a clear, permanent, and complete wiping out of an infectious agent. While much has been learned about the virus's ability to spread between people, infect cells, and put infected people at risk of a range of major health problems, estimating its duration in a global population depends on how we all behave, which can be much harder to model. Much as predictions on climate change vary depending on how we act now, it might be possible to propose scenarios that similarly forecast the different futures facing us. Now, one question arises What if we lived in a perfect world? Taking the actions of nations such as New Zealand and Vietnam as case studies, effective social distancing measures are an effective way to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, showing that the virus can be eradicated on at least a local level. The reasons why people in different communities don't engage in social distancing are complex and varied. Some are influenced by personal, political, and moral values. Others are affected by economic decisions, lacking social welfare to support them. In a perfect world, where distancing was followed strictly enough to make the number of community transmissions negligible all over the world, the current generation of functioning virus particles would be the last. SARS-CoV-2 particles would then break down in the air within hours. On surfaces, within just a few days. Knowing how long the virus persists in a human body is a little harder to pin down. One early study showed it remains viable for about nine days after first symptoms appear, with viral fragments detectable as long as a month later. In best cases, a month or two of perfect global isolation appears to be enough to clear all humans of the virus for good. Our world is far from perfect. What's more reasonable? Without social isolation to reduce the virus's transmission from infected parties, protection from widespread immunity is the next best thing. This factor depends on how long the average person retains immunity from SARS-CoV-2, a factor that is still unclear. The memory cells that produce antibodies could remain effective for as few as a couple of months, or last as long as a couple of years or more. A vaccine distributed and delivered within a short enough time frame could force the R (number of people likely to be infected by another infected person) to drop below a figure necessary for the virus to hang around. While producing vaccines for past coronaviruses was problematic, there has been significant progress for SARS-CoV-2. Early efforts are showing promise, meaning we could optimistically expect moderately effective vaccines to be available by the end of 2020 to early 2021. If doses could be produced in sufficient quantities - itself a practical and logistical hurdle - they would still need to be distributed into the far corners of the globe. Then there's the question of how many people could (or even would) be vaccinated. There are few precedents we can look towards. One involved the diplomatic efforts of the World Health Organisation, a program to eradicate smallpox finally succeeded in the late 1970s. The Global Smallpox Program took nearly twenty years to meet its goals, but it also suffered from limited vaccines and low funding. With enough funds and cooperation, we could feasibly globally eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in years rather than decades. Will the coronavirus be around forever? The bleakest of realities is SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay, with reservoirs of the virus being maintained among globally-connected communities for the foreseeable future. Vaccines will most likely improve in efficiency and production, though human behaviour being what it is, even making them mandatory will make it unlikely they'll be administered in sufficient quantities. New medications will more than likely help reduce the numbers of deaths and other adverse health effects. Politics, social trends, and new ways of conducting business and domestic living will evolve to reflect individual values towards COVID-19's spread. Historically, pandemics either fade, as deaths and infections plummet, or we just get used to the ebb and flow of a new disease. Science can only do so much. The rest is up to a global population of humans who increasingly distrust one another more than they fear a killer virus.

            "answer_text": "According to historians, pandemics typically have two types of endings: the medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes. \u201cWhen people ask, \u2018When will this end?,\u2019 they are asking about the social ending,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Greene, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins. In other words, an end can occur not because a disease has been vanquished but because people grow tired of panic mode and learn to live with a disease. Allan Brandt, a Harvard historian, said something similar was happening with COVID-19: \u201cAs we have seen in the debate about opening the economy, many questions about the so-called end are determined not by medical and public health data but by sociopolitical processes.\u201d Endings \u201care very, very messy,\u201d said Dora Vargha, a historian at the University of Exeter. \u201cLooking back, we have a weak narrative. For whom does the epidemic end, and who gets to say?\u201d In the Path of Fear An epidemic of fear can occur even without an epidemic of illness. Dr. Susan Murray, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, saw that firsthand in 2014 when she was a fellow at a rural hospital in Ireland. In the preceding months, more than 11,000 people in West Africa had died from Ebola, a terrifying viral disease that was highly infectious and often fatal. The epidemic seemed to be waning, and no cases had occurred in Ireland, but the public fear was palpable. \u201cOn the street and on the wards, people are anxious,\u201d Murray recalled recently in an article in The New England Journal of Medicine. \u201cHaving the wrong color skin is enough to earn you the side-eye from your fellow passengers on the bus or train. Cough once, and you will find them shuffling away from you.\u201d The Dublin hospital workers were warned to prepare for the worst. They were terrified and worried that they lacked protective equipment. When a young man arrived in the emergency room from a country with Ebola patients, no one wanted to go near him; nurses hid, and doctors threatened to leave the hospital. Murray alone dared treat him, she wrote, but his cancer was so advanced that all she could offer was comfort care. A few days later, tests confirmed that the man did not have Ebola; he died an hour later. Three days afterward, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola epidemic over. Murray wrote, \u201cIf we are not prepared to fight fear and ignorance as actively and as thoughtfully as we fight any other virus, it is possible that fear can do terrible harm to vulnerable people, even in places that never see a single case of infection during an outbreak. And a fear epidemic can have far worse consequences when complicated by issues of race, privilege and language.\u201d Black Death and Dark Memories Bubonic plague has struck several times in the past 2,000 years, killing millions of people and altering the course of history. Each epidemic amplified the fear that came with the next outbreak. The disease is caused by a strain of bacteria, Yersinia pestis, that lives on fleas that live on rats. But bubonic plague, which became known as the Black Death, also can be passed from infected person to infected person through respiratory droplets, so it cannot be eradicated simply by killing rats. Historians describe three great waves of plague, said Mary Fissell, a historian at Johns Hopkins: the Plague of Justinian, in the sixth century; the medieval epidemic, in the 14th century; and a pandemic that struck in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The medieval pandemic began in 1331 in China. The illness, along with a civil war that was raging at the time, killed half the population of China. From there, the plague moved along trade routes to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In the years between 1347 and 1351, it killed at least one-third of the European population. Half the population of Siena, Italy, died. \u201cIt is impossible for the human tongue to recount the awful truth,\u201d wrote 14th-century chronicler Agnolo di Tura. \u201cIndeed, one who did not see such horribleness can be called blessed.\u201d The infected, he wrote, \u201cswell beneath the armpits and in their groins and fall over while talking.\u201d The dead were buried in pits, in piles. In Florence, Italy, wrote Giovanni Boccaccio, \u201cNo more respect was accorded to dead people than would nowadays be accorded to dead goats.\u201d Some hid in their homes. Others refused to accept the threat. Their way of coping, Boccaccio wrote, was to \u201cdrink heavily, enjoy life to the full, go round singing and merrymaking, and gratify all of one\u2019s cravings when the opportunity emerged, and shrug the whole thing off as one enormous joke.\u201d That pandemic ended, but the plague recurred. One of the worst outbreaks began in China in 1855 and spread worldwide, killing more than 12 million in India alone. Health authorities in Mumbai, India, burned whole neighborhoods trying to rid them of the plague. \u201cNobody knew if it made a difference,\u201d Yale historian Frank Snowden said. It is not clear what made the bubonic plague die down. Some scholars have argued that cold weather killed the disease-carrying fleas, but that would not have interrupted the spread by the respiratory route, Snowden noted. Or perhaps it was a change in the rats. By the 19th century, the plague was being carried not by black rats but by brown rats, which are stronger, more vicious and more likely to live apart from humans. \u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t want one for a pet,\u201d Snowden said. Another hypothesis is that the bacterium evolved to be less deadly. Or maybe actions by humans, such as the burning of villages, helped quell the epidemic. The plague never really went away. In the United States, infections are endemic among prairie dogs in the Southwest and can be transmitted to people. Snowden said that one of his friends became infected after a stay at a hotel in New Mexico. The previous occupant of his room had a dog, which had fleas that carried the microbe. Such cases are rare and can now be successfully treated with antibiotics, but any report of a case of the plague stirs up fear. One Disease That Actually Ended Among the diseases to have achieved a medical end is smallpox. But it is exceptional for several reasons: There is an effective vaccine, which gives lifelong protection; the virus, Variola minor, has no animal host, so eliminating the disease in humans meant total elimination; and its symptoms are so unusual that infection is obvious, allowing for effective quarantines and contact tracing. But while it still raged, smallpox was horrific. Epidemic after epidemic swept the world for at least 3,000 years. Individuals infected with the virus developed a fever, then a rash that turned into pus-filled spots, which became encrusted and fell off, leaving scars. The disease killed 3 out of 10 of its victims, often after immense suffering. In 1633, an epidemic among Native Americans \u201cdisrupted all the native communities in the northeast and certainly facilitated English settlement in Massachusetts,\u201d said Harvard historian David Jones. William Bradford, leader of the Plymouth colony, wrote an account of the disease in Native Americans, saying the broken pustules would effectively glue a patient\u2019s skin to the mat he lay on, only to be torn off. Bradford wrote, \u201cWhen they turn them, a whole side will flay off at once as it were, and they will be all of a gore blood, most fearful to behold.\u201d The last person to contract smallpox naturally was Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Somalia, in 1977. He recovered, only to die of malaria in 2013. Forgotten Influenzas The 1918 flu is held up today as the example of the ravages of a pandemic and the value of quarantines and social distancing. Before it ended, the flu killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide. It preyed on young to middle-aged adults \u2014 orphaning children, depriving families of breadwinners, killing troops in the midst of World War I. In the autumn of 1918, William Vaughan, a prominent doctor, was dispatched to Camp Devens near Boston to report on a flu that was raging there. He saw \u201chundreds of stalwart young men in the uniform of their country, coming into the wards of the hospital in groups of 10 or more,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are placed on the cots until every bed is full, yet others crowd in. Their faces soon wear a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings up bloodstained sputum. In the morning the dead bodies are stacked up in the morgue like cord wood.\u201d The virus, he wrote, \u201cdemonstrated the inferiority of human inventions in the destruction of human life.\u201d After sweeping through the world, that flu faded away, evolving into a variant of the more benign flu that comes around every year. \u201cMaybe it was like a fire that, having burned the available and easily accessible wood, burns down,\u201d Snowden said. It ended socially, too. World War I was over; people were ready for a fresh start, a new era, and eager to put the nightmare of disease and war behind them. Until recently, the 1918 flu was largely forgotten. Other flu pandemics followed \u2014 none so bad, but all nonetheless sobering. In the Hong Kong flu of 1968, 1 million people died worldwide, including 100,000 in the United States, mostly people older than 65. That virus still circulates as a seasonal flu, and its initial path of destruction \u2014 and the fear that went with it \u2014 is rarely recalled. How Will COVID-19 End?Will that happen with COVID-19? One possibility, historians say, is that the coronavirus pandemic could end socially before it ends medically. People may grow so tired of the restrictions that they declare the pandemic over, even as the virus continues to smolder in the population and before a vaccine or effective treatment is found. \u201cI think there is this sort of social psychological issue of exhaustion and frustration,\u201d Yale historian Naomi Rogers said. \u201cWe may be in a moment when people are just saying, \u2018That\u2019s enough. I deserve to be able to return to my regular life.\u2019\u201d It is happening already; in some states, governors have lifted restrictions, allowing hair salons, nail salons and gyms to reopen, in defiance of warnings by public health officials that such steps are premature. As the economic catastrophe wreaked by the lockdowns grows, more and more people may be ready to say \u201cenough.\u201d \u201cThere is this sort of conflict now,\u201d Rogers said. Public health officials have a medical end in sight, but some members of the public see a social end. \u201cWho gets to claim the end?\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIf you push back against the notion of its ending, what are you pushing back against? What are you claiming when you say, \u2018No, it is not ending.\u2019\u201d The challenge, Brandt said, is that there will be no sudden victory. Trying to define the end of the pandemic \u201cwill be a long and difficult process.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Probably never.We might never get rid of the virus itself.We might develop a sort of immunity against it via some vaccine or some other biological advancement.Your question should have been when will the pandemic end?Again you have to call me a pessimist.It\u2019s not gonna end so quickly. Reasons are so many. The disease is being terribly under-estimated. Many people believe or are tempted to believe that it\u2019s just a common flu.Even if we get infected,we\u2019ll recover in a few days.But no my boy\u2026!Italy hs suffered due to the same cause.The masses didn\u2019t co-operate with the government and they are now on the top of deaths(about 17,127 deaths as per date and time).There are always repercussions for whatever you do.Now when you hear the cry of an italy woman,you don\u2019t find place to just,just think what has happened in italy.  There are not now even sufficient mortuaries for the died people to be kept in.Seriously every human including me will be very sorrowful and grieved to see those heaps of dead-bodies of people waiting to be settled\u2026at least.Certainly no human deserves this death.If anything is sacred,human body is sacred.(Mean no offense). The recent cases depict this table:  Why U.S. has suffered so much.I attribute it to the number of elderly people which have been increased via advancement in gerontology (branch of biology that deals with study of aging).Actually in America,the recent datat shows that in 2016,people over age 65 years numbered 49.2 million.Aged people have decreased immunity.  Also in under-developed countries,lock-downs can not be imposed for a long while.The poor people who are principally daily-wagers can not live without their day\u2019s work.Hence they have to break the limitations of lock-downs.This somewhat increases the contact among people and the virus goes on spreading.It\u2019s the most deadly cause since in countries with shattered economy,you can never manage to deliver food to the houses in slums and ghettos.They have to make their own way and break away from the lock-down:  Here is a brief format of how COVID-19 spread into UK in the earliest stage:  The worse thing is that some people who know that they are infected don\u2019t go to hospitals.They \u201cfear\u201d or feel a sort of \u201canxiety\u201d.Even in some countries,people have left the quarantine camps in fear and rage. We can just protect ourselves by acting upon the precautionary measures.Total deaths as per date are about 81,000 and infected people are greater than 1.4 million.Yes,admittedly,we are too late.But we can \u201cat least\u201d flatten the curve of increasing cases by ourselves.\u201dPeople\u201d will have to be aware and sensible.Otherwise any government can not control this situation:  Hope the best.

            "answer_text": "As a person who studied Veterinary Medicine at University, we had 2 courses, that may lead us to the answer; Epidemiology and Virology. Short answer: I think within the next 3 months maximum. Let me be frank, I always hated this Virus.  Virology Perspective: Maybe Corona Virus is new for the people, but not for us in Veterinary Medicine. As you know, Corona came from an animal source. We knew about and studied it for about 5 decades. They are from a nasty family called Coronaviridae! That family has 2 ugly sons, one would be less harassing called ToroVirus, but the elder son is called CoronaVirus and it is very wild and bullying.  It spawned a wild range of diseases in farm animals and pets. The main source of the virus was from an animal with a little change (called a \u201cMutation\u201d) Just like humans, in most cases, it does some damage to the respiratory system in animals too. My poor dear cat Gandhi has died because of a disease called (FIP) for this damn virus (let me say again, I hate it).  Many dogs, cats, rabbits, avians, swine, calves, and ferrets have died because of this nasty Coronavirus. It's really tough and deadly from this point of view. According to my Virology books, I remember that the weather & temperature had a great effect on the mortality and the outbreak rate of the virus. In the summertime, as the temperature rises, the effects of the virus dramatically decrease. It seems that it is sensitive to heat. (say again, my poor cat died in winter!)  Although we should see what kind of change this little maniac has done (the mutation), I hope that is not resistant to heat![1] in the same cases as SARS and MERS diseases also caused by a coronavirus, changes in temperature had an important role in the spread of disease, and these diseases were known as seasonal diseases.[2] According to this evidence, I conclude that: it will become less common in the next three months. (at least I hope so).  Epidemiology Perspective: This scenario really depends on us and how the government controls the country. The formula is simple: Lockdown the whole country; Separate and quarantine the carriers and the patients from others; Strictly cut the connection of the people. Let those who are carriers become ill or develop some immunity to the virus and give medical help to those who are too ill to recover (sadly some people won\u2019t make it); Limit the sources and make the area of disease smaller, and let the effect of the virus pass. As we know the Corona incubation period and the recovery or death progress in the human body, with locking down the area (Country in this case) and doing as exactly what the protocol quarantine says in a pandemic; you need about 3 months maximum.  Just like China's case! As you have seen, China locked down a whole province of 56 Million people. If we quarantine a place where a deadly outbreak happens, we can really reduce the effectiveness of the epidemy by about 90%. But it's not easy. It must be done properly and extremely strictly, sometimes cruelly, with a good plan and algorithm and in accordance with the origin of the disease. Yes, we do it with animals on the farm its really effective (in diseases with extremely high mortality rate like Gas Gangrene 100%, Babesiosis50%, compared to Corona with 2% mortality rate) but maybe it's not practical for human societies. As you have seen, China has done it & I really believe that they have done it right. Maybe it was cruel but look when you don\u2019t do it like China, you have a death rate like Italy or my country Iran! I hope to see it vanish by summertime. I just missed my vacation in Lebanon for the new year holidays because of this damn virus. Until then, take care!  First of all, I appreciate all your shares, comments, and thankful messages, I would like to add that this may not be a misunderstanding. What I wrote was about the pandemic & epidemic phase of the virus. It is clear that the virus will certainly be present forever, but not as deadly as it is now. As the Spanish flu 1918 happened and the causes were a virus from Orthomyxoviridae family, the flu and its virus are present today, we get the flu, but our death rate is very low comparing to the time of the epidemic and pandemic. Of course, in the near future, we will probably have much more information about the virus, with at least 50 pharmaceutical companies around the world are researching for the vaccine, and our understanding of the treatment and how it spreads will certainly increase. Then, the pandemic phase will Stop.

            "answer_text": "I try to avoid the news. I have a weak immune system so I know that I should stay home, keep good hygiene and practice social distancing. As a New Yorker, I am comforted by Andrew Cuomo\u2019s briefings. I don\u2019t watch the news, but his briefings are everywhere. He\u2019s the new post 9\u201311 Giuliani. I expect him to be Time\u2019s Person of the Year. He has been an absolute rock in these uncertain and scary times. I don\u2019t think this will be a plague. If people, and I\u2019m specifically speaking of New Yorkers, would stay home, shower daily, wash their hands and stop hoarding toilet paper and Lysol, I do believe the number of infected people will drop substantially. I went to the supermarket with my daughter on Sunday (we had run out of essentials) and I could not believe how many people were outside, just taking strolls as though it was a regular brunch Sunday in Park Slope. I bought my groceries quickly and showered immediately. My daughter showered after I did. What is wrong with people? Do they not understand? As Cuomo is a leader and provides information and assurance, Mayor DiBlasio is beginning to show signs of an angry father. His \u201ckids\u201d are not listening to him and he\u2019s threatening punishment. I\u2019m ok with that. Finally. People are not taking this seriously and yes, you should close the parks, you should enforce a curfew, you should have police breaking up groups of people hanging out on the stoop. I don\u2019t know how this pandemic will end, but being at its epicenter is stressful. It\u2019s complete disorganization. I believe some might feel that they are on vacation. Others have no income and no foreseeable income. I am one of those people. I do not think the death toll, if people would be aware of their responsibilities, will reach into the millions. I doubt it will reach one million, but as a Brooklynite, I implore everyone to please stop hoarding, wash your hands and arms up to your elbows, try to stay indoors as much as possible and if you can, check on your elderly neighbors.

            "answer_text": "\u201cSocial distancing and quarantine is fine, but till when?\u201d This is the question that everyone is asking right now. At this point in history, the virus is now a global pandemic and information on it is coming from all sources where everyone\u2019s an expert; yet there\u2019s a dearth of reliable information on how actually all of this would end and life would return to \u2018normal\u2019. Here are the options that humanity currently has, according to the world\u2019s leading experts: 1.Herd Immunity: This term essentially means when enough people in a community are immune to the virus that it cannot hold and dies out. There are two paths to this, the first being: Immunization. A vaccine needs to be developed and delivered to a sufficient amount of people that the virus cannot affect them anymore. The second path is not as easy; it requires the virus to spread over to a large number of people who ultimately develop resistance to it that way over time. It may result in a long time and loss of life. 2. Eradication with vaccine: Various vaccines are in the works for this virus, including a spike protein vaccine, which when injected, would force your body to make antibodies, which would be utilised when faced with the actual virus. It is projected that a vaccine would be developed with the next 12\u201318 months. It is to be kept in mind that clinical trials first go from animals to human, and then take time to be mass-manufactured for eradication complete with efficacy checks. However, complete eradication of a disease is rare and difficult, even with the presence of a competent vaccine. At the moment, the development of a vaccine is one of the most viable options for us. 3. Possibility of containment: This scenario, while being the most optimistic one, is one of the most unlikely ones. Aubree Gordon, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan has this to say about it: It is increasingly likely that this virus will spread worldwide. We still may have some chance to contain it, but that window does appear to be closing. Containing the spread of the virus will be extremely difficult. There are a few reasons for that: SARS-CoV-2 spreads very easily, most cases of COVID-19 aren't severe and thus may not be identified, and the virus has a long incubation period or the time between when a person is infected and when they start showing symptoms.  The biggest failure seems to be the slow rollout of testing. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) had been slow to give out the COVID-19 testing kits and were initially limited to the people with foreign travel history. Unlike SARS in 2003, in which patients did not spread the virus without showing symptoms first: they first got sicker and contracted pneumonia; this virus is a biological challenge since it is possible to transmit it without seeing the symptoms. 4. Natural taper-off: When a virus is transmitted from an affected person to a person who is not susceptible, the chain of infection breaks. If the virus ultimately runs out of people to infect, as was the case with Spanish Flu during the Second World War, it stops spreading. There\u2019s a possibility of a lucky scenario in which the virus slows down its spread in the summer months, thus decreasing the spread rate, however less likely. A ray of hope lies in the fact that COVID-19 may mutate again, this time beneficially for humans, making it more difficult to transmit.  5. Lingering on: Since the complete eradication of a disease is difficult and rarely achieved, the possibility that it may go back to its natural animal form, giving it a chance to mutate and circulate again. There's a chance that, even if we manage to quench this virus, it might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year like other seasonal diseases such as the flu or colds. If that happens, there's a chance it could have less of an impact during subsequent circulations because more people will have built up immunity. But it's not clear if humans can become reinfected with this virus yet. SARS had a relatively low mutation rate, so it didn't reoccur; influenza, by contrast, has a really high mutation rate and thus reoccurs every year. If SARS-CoV-2 manages to mutate substantially in the coming months, the vaccines scientists produce now might not be well matched by the time it reoccurs. So, these are likely scenarios that we may face in the future: The Plausible Scenario: A major portion of the world could get infected, and may result in herd immunity. The Nightmare Scenario: A sudden spike in cases could overwhelm the healthcare system and may cause a shortage of medical equipment and PPEs. The Better Scenario: Public Health measures may buy scientists enough time to come up with a vaccine. The Lucky Scenario: The virus stops spreading as fast in the summer months, automatically reducing the spread rate. The Likely End: With the development of a vaccine and its timely administration. The public shouldn\u2019t expect to return to normal life just as soon since the lockdown needs to lifted gradually. An abrupt lift could cause a sharp rise in cases, which would prove to be detrimental. The responsibility that the public holds at the moment is to behave responsibly and keep in mind the lesser privileged whilst maintaining social distance. Let\u2019s flatten the curve together. >D< References: How does the coronavirus outbreak end? Vox2. When, and How, Does the Coronavirus Pandemic End? Bloomberg Quint 3.

            "answer_text": "This epidemic will likely to be stopped by a vaccine. Ideally, It will end in one of three ways, assume the if the conditions for its spreading remain unchanged (the real life different, but much more complex): 1.the majority of the vulnerable population gets infected (AKA \u201cHerd immunity\u201d) 3.a breakthrough in technology(vaccines, etc) 2.greatly slows down the rate of spreading to a \u201cmagic number\u201d so that soon no one will host this virus Let me write some codes and make some graphs to demonstrate each case: 1a.\u201dHerd Immunity\u201d without any action Assume the entire population of 1,000,000 is vulnerable to such virus, travel is allowed and frequent, and nothing slows done the spreading: Starts with 0.01% of the population infected and each patient spread the virus to others at a spreading rate of 0.3 person/day (subject to change, for example, if total case = 50% the population, then it drops to 0.15, because half of the 0.3 person is already infected, or recovered) while the patient is an active case (14 days into infection): New cases each day:  Active cases each day:  Total cases in 100 days:  As these graph suggests, the outbreak becomes more severe each day exponentially until it infects a significant fraction of the population, and eventually infect the entire population. 1b. \u201cHerd Immunity\u201d after some action to slow down the spreading: But what if we slow done the spreading of the virus? Masks, quarantine and lock downs all serve this purpose. While the math model for those methods can be extremely difficult and complex, they generally has a simple effect: reduce the spreading rate. Let\u2019s see what happens if we slow down the spreading rate to 50%, or from 0.3 to 0.15:  Herd Immunity(bad) Or slow down to 25%, or 0.075:  Herd Immunity(Much better than the last one, but still infects 10% of the population): Unfortunately, even if we manage to slow down the spreading rate to 0.075, most of the population will still be infected, and we will have \u201cHerd immunity\u201d. 2. A vaccine that saves us timely: However, the virus in the second graph takes several years to spread, and we can probably develop a vaccine on hopefully day 300 or so:  A poor demonstration of a vaccine that ends the epidemic And we will only have ~12000 total cases! 3. extreme approaches to greatly slow down the spreading: Remember the last case where we have lowered the rate of spreading to 0.075? This is actually very close to a magic number! As each patient is active for 14 days, each will infect 0.75*14 = 1.05 persons, so more and more new case will appear, until total cases reaches around 5% of the population, so that each new patient infects 0.75*14*(1\u20130.05)=0.9975, and less new patient will appear. What if we lower this number to < 1/14 ? Let\u2019s try 0.07 instead of 0.075!  What happens if we lower the number of infections from each person to <1 Only ~4000 cases! Compare to ~100000 at 0.075, the tiny change makes a huge difference! Let\u2019s see the relation between the percentage population that gets infected and how much we slow down the spreading:  A huge gap between try hard and try even harder Impressive isn\u2019t it? Indeed the last approach is the most effective and fastest, but it very hard to implement(easier in a authoritarian society) , and prone to have a second wave. It works best if a vaccine is made before the second wave hits. As the 3rd way is almost impossible to happen in the entire world, and a vaccine is likely to come before the situation in the 1st case happens, this epidemic will likely to end with a vaccine. ",

            "answer_text": "Well this is an interesting question\u2026.The 2019 Novel Coronavirus has originated in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 Right now, epidemiologists explain three possible scenarios on how this outbreak could end\u2026.But keep in mind that there is a lot of uncertainty on how this may turn out\u2026 Exactly four months ago, the virus 2019-nCoV was unknown to human science but now health officials are working furiously to understand it, trying to prevent a pandemic. Right now, infectious disease experts are outlining three broad scenarios for the future of this outbreak. 1) The spread of the virus gets under control through public health interventions This is the best-case scenario, and essentially what happened with the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003.SARS, like this new virus, is also a coronavirus \u2014 a group of viruses that cause disease in mammals and birds. There several known coronaviruses that infect humans; others infect animals. SARS mainly infects animals, but can jump to humans and start spreading among them. In late 2002 and 2003, SARS infected 8,096 people (mainly in China), and killed 774 people in 17 countries. Remarkably: By 2004, SARS was basically gone. \u201cSARS was the classic case of how various public health interventions can work and stop an outbreak,\u201d Unfortunately, it might be hard to repeat the success of controlling SARS with this new outbreak. SARS was somewhat easier to contain. For one, infected people typically didn\u2019t spread the disease until they were showing symptoms, like a fever. That means once a person got sick, they could be taken care of in quarantine, and transmission would stop there. Also, in the case of SARS, health officials were a bit lucky as \u201cit was not very efficient at transmitting outside of health care settings, and without the aid of super spreaders,\u201d but the 2019 Novel Coronavirus can spread without showing symptoms and hence it would be very hard to trace the origins and also contact tracing becomes hard. Invention of a new vaccine could eventually end this outbreak : But even in the fastest scenario, that could take years. \u201cSo it really comes down to how good individual public health agencies are at detecting cases, getting them care, putting them into isolation, and how good the people who are infected are at their own hygiene. 2) The virus burns itself out after it infects all or most of the people most susceptible to it Disease outbreaks are a bit like fires. The virus is the flame. Susceptible people are the fuel. Eventually, a fire burns itself out if it runs out of kindling. A virus outbreak will end when it stops finding susceptible people to infect. This isn\u2019t a desirable scenario. It will involve many more people getting sick, possibly dying. How bad it would be depend on aspects of the disease. Officials are trying to understand: how many people who catch the infection get sick, how many of those people die, and how easy is it to spread from one person to the next. Which brings us to my last point for today 3) Coronavirus becomes yet another common virus There\u2019s a third scenario about how this outbreak ends. That it doesn\u2019t. This has happened before. In 2009, a new strain of the H1N1 flu virus encircled the globe in a pandemic. But, \u201cafter a while it became a part of our normal repertoire of what might come up each flu season,\u201d Humanity doesn\u2019t really need another common virus to contend with. \u201cIt does seem to have some capacity to cause severe disease,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just causing common colds. We have people that have died from it. We have people in ICUs \u2014 all of that makes it something you want to get a handle on. It doesn\u2019t quite seem as severe as SARS but it definitely seems more severe than the other coronaviruses that we\u2019re used to dealing with every year.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "In the short term, the crisis will give fuel to all the various camps in the Western grand strategy debate. The nationalists and anti-globalists, the China hawks, and even the liberal internationalists will all see new evidence for the urgency of their views. Given the economic damage and social collapse that is unfolding, it is hard to see anything other than a reinforcement of the movement toward nationalism, great-power rivalry, strategic decoupling, and the like. Like the fall of the Berlin Wall or the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the coronavirus pandemic is a world-shattering event whose far-ranging consequences we can only begin to imagine today. This much is certain: Just as this disease has shattered lives, disrupted markets and exposed the competence (or lack thereof) of governments, it will lead to permanent shifts in political and economic power in ways that will become apparent only later. To help us make sense of the ground shifting beneath our feet as this crisis unfolds, Foreign Policy asked 12 leading thinkers from around the world to weigh in with their predictions for the global order after the pandemic. The pandemic will strengthen the state and reinforce nationalism. Governments of all types will adopt emergency measures to manage the crisis, and many will be loath to relinquish these new powers when the crisis is over. COVID-19 will also accelerate the shift in power and influence from West to East. South Korea and Singapore have responded best, and China has reacted well after its early mistakes. The response in Europe and America has been slow and haphazard by comparison, further tarnishing the aura of the Western \u201cbrand.\u201d What won\u2019t change is the fundamentally conflictive nature of world politics. Previous plagues did not end great-power rivalry nor usher in a new era of global cooperation. Previous plagues\u2014including the influenza epidemic of 1918-1919\u2014did not end great-power rivalry nor usher in a new era of global cooperation. Neither will COVID-19. We will see a further retreat from hyperglobalization, as citizens look to national governments to protect them and as states and firms seek to reduce future vulnerabilities. The coronavirus pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back of economic globalization. China\u2019s growing economic and military power had already provoked a bipartisan determination in the United States to decouple China from U.S.-sourced high technology and intellectual property and try to force allies to follow suit. Increasing public and political pressure to meet carbon emissions reduction targets had already called into question many companies\u2019 reliance on long-distance supply chains. Now, COVID-19 is forcing governments, companies, and societies to strengthen their capacity to cope with extended periods of economic self-isolation. The coronavirus pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back of economic globalization. It seems highly unlikely in this context that the world will return to the idea of mutually beneficial globalization that defined the early 21st century. And without the incentive to protect the shared gains from global economic integration, the architecture of global economic governance established in the 20th century will quickly atrophy. It will then take enormous self-discipline for political leaders to sustain international cooperation and not retreat into overt geopolitical competition. Proving to their citizens that they can manage the COVID-19 crisis will buy leaders some political capital. But those who fail will find it hard to resist the temptation to blame others for their future. The COVID-19 pandemic will not fundamentally alter global economic directions. It will only accelerate a change that had already begun: a move away from U.S.-centric globalization to a more China-centric globalization. It will only accelerate a change that had already begun: a move away from U.S.-centric globalization to a more China-centric globalization. Why will this trend continue? The American population has lost faith in globalization and international trade. Free trade agreements are toxic, with or without U.S. President Donald Trump. By contrast, China has not lost faith. Why not? There are deeper historical reasons. Chinese leaders now know well that China\u2019s century of humiliation from 1842 to 1949 was a result of its own complacency and a futile effort by its leaders to cut it off from the world. By contrast, the past few decades of economic resurgence were a result of global engagement. The Chinese people have also experienced an explosion of cultural confidence. They believe they can compete anywhere.Consequently, as I document in my new book, Has China Won?, the United States has two choices. If its primary goal is to maintain global primacy, it will have to engage in a zero-sum geopolitical contest, politically and economically, with China. However, if the goal of the United States is to improve the well-being of the American people\u2014whose social condition has deteriorated\u2014it should cooperate with China. Wiser counsel would suggest that cooperation would be the better choice. However, given the toxic U.S. political environment toward China, wiser counsel may not prevail.In the short term, the crisis will give fuel to all the various camps in the Western grand strategy debate. The nationalists and anti-globalists, the China hawks, and even the liberal internationalists will all see new evidence for the urgency of their views. Given the economic damage and social collapse that is unfolding, it is hard to see anything other than a reinforcement of the movement toward nationalism, great-power rivalry, strategic decoupling.But just like in the 1930s and \u201940s, there might also be a slower-evolving countercurrent, a sort of hardheaded internationalism similar to the one that Franklin D. Roosevelt and a few other statesmen began to articulate before and during the war. The 1930s collapse of the world economy showed how connected modern societies were and how vulnerable they were to what FDR called contagion. The United States was less threatened by other great powers than by the deep forces\u2014and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character\u2014of modernity. What FDR and other internationalists conjured was a postwar order that would rebuild an open system with new forms of protection and capacities to manage interdependence. The United States couldn\u2019t simply hide within its borders, but to operate in an open postwar order required the building of a global infrastructure of multilateral cooperation.So the United States and other Western democracies might travel through this same sequence of reactions driven by a cascading sense of vulnerability; the response might be more nationalist at first, but over the longer term, the democracies will come out of their shells to find a new type of pragmatic and protective internationalism.COVID-19 is undermining the basic tenets of global manufacturing. Companies will now rethink and shrink the multistep, multicountry supply chains that dominate production today.Global supply chains were already coming under fire\u2014economically, due to rising Chinese labor costs, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, and advances in robotics, automation, and 3D printing, as well as politically, due to real and perceived job losses, especially in mature economies. COVID-19 has now broken many of these links: Factory closings in afflicted areas have left other manufacturers\u2014as well as hospitals, pharmacies, supermarkets, and retail stores\u2014bereft of inventories and products.On the other side of the pandemic, more companies will demand to know more about where their supplies come from and will trade off efficiency for redundancy. Governments will intervene as well, forcing what they consider strategic industries to have domestic backup plans and reserves. Profitability will fall, but supply stability should rise.",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s the golden question that everyone ask at this time. If the U.S. continues to open everything back up, forcing schools to open back up, and the economy, experts stated say good bye to going back to the normal life until at least 2022. U.S. alone is responsible for around 25 percent of all cases in the world. Standing at 3.5 million cases and counting, it defeats the other countries in cases by a FAR margin. Certain states in the U.S. alone has more cases than entire countries. At this rate, if we don\u2019t enact new safety laws, individuals aren\u2019t wearing masks, keeps going out while opening everything back up, experts say that by 2021, a third of the US population will be infected (~~120 million cases, 0.5%-1% of the infected populations being critical cases). Adding to top of that, CDC estimates that the actual case count as of right now might be 10 times higher than the data that\u2019s revealed at the moment. So, CDC estimates that as of right now, 25\u201330 million are infected in the US. Oh, only 0.5%-1% percent? That\u2019s not bad all, right? Well, here is the answer to that similar question.  Think about the statements listed above. Our healthcare system would demolish, so would our economy. If we keep going at the rate we are going, many experts say that chance of this happening is very likely. Shutting down the economy right now for a period of time would greatly outweigh the benefit of opening things back up early in order to save the economy. To those of you who refuses to wear a mask, this is the result you people are leading into. \u201cCoronavirus is a hoax, it\u2019s fake.\u201d Keep that same mindset until you get infected and have to get a ventilator while your lung is dying for oxygen. For the sake of our future and the health of the public, wear a fucking mask and don\u2019t go out except for necessities. However, don\u2019t lose hope! New Zealand was the first country to announce to the world that they have completely abolished COVID-19. They went on number of days without a single case, which resulted in every restrictions and lockdown lifted. Yes, we all know that it\u2019s a lot easier to control the spread of the virus when the country and the population is a lot less than the US population, but it still shows that with proper laws and participation by everyone, abolishment of COVID-19 is quick and possible.

            "answer_text": " When will coronavirus end? We all know how this pandemic began. Originating from a Wuhan seafood market in China, the virus has now spread to almost every single country, locking down the whole world for a good six months now. But little do we know about how or when this pandemic will end. It is probably safe to say we are still nowhere near the end. Cases are still surging everywhere around the globe, countries breaking their own records every single day. Lockdowns, social distancing, wearing masks - nothing has really worked completely in containing the virus so far. Governments are being torn between saving lives or the economy, taking short sighted decisions, and making it even worse. Nothing concrete has been found yet to stop this virus. \"We are still in the midst of an accelerating, intense, and very serious pandemic.\" \u2013 BBC quoted Dr Margaret Harris from the WHO in an article earlier this week. Although this is one single virus that caused the pandemic, there have been hundreds and thousands of theories and speculations. Its diversity in nature and effects within regions and countries can easily blind one to the reality beyond his/her own country. Historians believe a pandemic can have two types of epilogues \u2013 medical and social. Medical ending happens when a permanent remedy is discovered and the affected and death cases plummet down to zero. This is probably what everyone is waiting for. Another is social ending, when everyone fights down their fear of the disease and learns to live with it. The New York Times quoted Dr Jeremy Greene, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkinssays - \"When people ask, 'When will this end?' they are asking about the social ending\". This pandemic may end socially before it ends medically. An epidemic of fear can have far worse consequences than the virus itself. People suffer more from this and eventually grow tired of the restrictions and the initial panic mode. That is when they eventually come out of their houses and learn to live with the virus following safety protocols - the new normal. And we are already seeing this happen in most of the countries. Think of Bangladesh for a moment. When the shutdown was first imposed in late March, the country suddenly stood still. People from all walks of life became restlessness among them, panic mode set in. The ever busy streets were suddenly empty, there was pin drop silence all around. Stepping out of home for nothing felt like a crime. And this did continue for a few months. However, over the last couple of months, people have begun to step out of their homes and carry on with their normal life. Offices, businesses, shops, restaurants, parks - almost everything has reopened, except for the educational institutions. The usual hustle and bustle of daily life is gradually coming back to life. This has recently been the case almost everywhere around the world. Fear and panic seems to have taken a back seat across the globe. Governments are trying hard to reopen important places and institutions to bring things back to normal, only to see a bigger surge in the coronavirus cases due to this. However, people are still trying to live their life, maintaining all safety protocols. Medical ending is actually the permanent solution, and a little bit complicated too. A working effective vaccine will destroy the virus and bring triumph over this pandemic, that is the common belief. Coming up with a proven working vaccine will not be that easy, and the current speculations regarding the virus only make it more complicated. So it is safe to say we are still far behind a permanent medical solution. Usually, it takes more than a year or two to develop a vaccine, depending on several issues. Based on that, we are nearly a good year away from getting a permanent working vaccine. It can get delayed for many reasons, and there are actually signs of conflicts here and there. The New York Times reported that on August 11, Russia has already approved a Gamaleya vaccine before Phase III testing. More than 165 vaccines are being developed against the coronavirus around the world, while 30 of them are in human trials. Human trials is the critical stage where it will determine whether the vaccine will actually work or not. Due to the mutations of the virus, it has only become more difficult. There are confusions and speculations, but it is widely hoped and expected that vaccines will be available in the later months of 2021. Some experts believe this pandemic will continue for at least two years with the vaccine being developed and distributed worldwide. Vivek Murthy, former US surgeon-general, has warned that the pandemic might not go away until the end of 2022. Microsoft co-founder, Bill Gates told Wired magazine on August 07, 2020- \"For the rich world, we should largely be able to end this thing by the end of 2021, and for the world at large, by the end of 2022.\" While hopes are high and fingers are crossed for a safe and effective vaccine as early as possible, there are several issues that complicate the whole process. Any concrete proof of reinfection may well halt the whole effort of developing a vaccine. If that is the case, then vaccines might not even offer permanent immunity. We still do not know how long antibodies work against the virus. And if somehow the vaccines do not offer permanent immunity from the virus, people may need the vaccine every year or two later, to maintain immunity, just like flu shot. According to The Atlantic, if immunity lasts a few months, there could be a huge pandemic followed by small outbreaks every year. Immunity lasting closer to two years could see Covid-19 peaking every other year and cases rising and falling over time. Herd immunity \u2013 with or without vaccines \u2013 can be a solution, but that will take some time to drive away the pandemic as well. To achieve herd immunity, the virus needs to be transmitted to around 65-70 per cent of the people. Sweden has taken this road of achieving herd immunity without a vaccine, which has proved to be costly with a much higher rate of deaths than other affected countries. Covid-19 may end up being another virus ending as an endemic, even with the discovery of vaccines. Vaccines actually exist for more than a dozen of human viruses, but only smallpox has been eradicated, The Atlantic reports. The virus has locked the whole world down for quite some time now, and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. The sooner the vaccines are available, the better. We better not expect that the vaccines will have a Hollywood-esque arrival and fix the problem in a flash. Proper vaccination will still take a good year or two given it works effectively once discovered. Social distancing and other safety protocols still need to be maintained while stepping out of home. It should be kept in mind that the pandemic is not over just because we are over it. And the question might just change from \"when\" to \"if\" this virus will be disappear and the pandemic will ever come to an end. ",

            "answer_text": "Well in the present situation we can't eradicate the virus anytime soon. But any epidemic or pandemic can end in only two ways. Everyone will get infected gradually and will attain immunity against the novel virus and end this threat.So by everyone I don't mean that all of us will be suffering from it at the same time. Infact that's quite a thing we are trying to prevent. Because that will be catastrophic for our health care system and it may collapse causing surge in the mortality rate. Now this is the novel Corona virus. It being a new virus, no one has immunity against it and hence it can infect almost everyone. And the transmission is devastating. But as more and more people will get infected and recover from it, they will serve and the chain breakers. On an individual level, our bodies build up immunity by producing antibodies that recognize and fight off an infection from invading pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. This is acquired immunity. The antibodies are like vaccines. They protect us against the reinfection and thus transmission. By vaccines we provide readymade antibodies to the susceptible people so that they get immune to the disease even without contracting it. This is called passive immunity. This is also the basis of plasma therapy. Wherein we infuse the antibodies from the plasma of recovered patients into those infected to kickstart their fight. This is much like passing on the sword. But this is under trails so let's not get into it. Let's make it a bit lucid. Scenario 1 Suppose A has the disease and he comes in contact with B C D E AND F. All these five people never had covid 19 and are susceptible to it. Hence all five will get infected, will manifest the disease in more or less severity depending on their comorbidities. But before and after manifesting the disease symptoms while they were carring the virus they will spread it to \u2019n' no of people who come in their contact and are susceptible too.  Scenario 2 Now T has the disease and T comes in contact with U, V ,B and D. But this time two of the four people have some immunity against the disease as they had contracted it. So they will not get the disease and hence will not spread forwards. So this time the spread is significantly reduced.   Now if in this way many others develop immunity we will be able to contain the spread. Because ultimately the infected person will be coming in contact with immune people who will break the chain and there will be no spread. This is called HERD IMMUNITY. For achieving herd immunity a huge chunk of people should be immune against the disease. This can be achieved by vaccination or infection. The vaccines are under trails and will require time to come into play. And if the herd immunity is to be achieved by infection, we have to take care that those getting the disease are in such controlled number which our health system can deal with. That's is what 'Flatten the curve' means. 2. Quarantine and isolation This we all are quite acquainted with by this time. If we successfully isolate \u2018A' and \u2018T\u2019 and quarantine everyone who came into their contact we will be able to contain the transmission. This is the purpose of lockdown everywhere. ",

            "answer_text": "Too much hype, exaggeration. Crazy media creates panic. You just need to look at statistics. I would not trust, for example, data coming from Iran or even Europe since many mild cases are probably not reported. I think the best example is \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d cruise ship, where everything could be checked and rechecked. So, what the data do we have from there? There were 3711 people on board (passengers and crew members); 696 of them got sick. In other words approximately 1 out of five people. 7 of them passed away. It meant the mortality rate is about 1%. Now, lets compare this to the regular (seasonal) flu. In the same close environment like this ship the ratio of people who get sick with flu is much higher (at least 4 times higher). The mortality rate is lower though. But if you take flu mortality of the fourth fifth of people (seasonal flue) and compare it to the mortality from \u201ccorona\u201d you will get approximately the same number of deaths. So, which one of two is more dangerous is a question. But there is no comparison in amount of hysteria, made mostly by the media, between coronavirus and regular flu. The outbreak of the seasonal flu went unnoticed while coronavirus was declared pandemic, it crashed the stock market and enormously damaged many people\u2019s lifestyle. Do you know how many people died so far from the coronavirus in USA since the start of the outbreak? You probably know, the data is everywhere: so far 41. Do you know how many people died from the seasonal flu at the same time? Probably not - media is mute. I will tell you: in the last two months (at least) more than 3000 people in USA died from the regular flu, according to CDC. Compare these two numbers: 41 and 3000. How much hype do you hear about 3000 and how much about 41? P.S Here, I will give you one more example: \u201cswine flu\u201d outbreak during Obama administration: 2009 H1N1 Pandemic which resulted in 12,459 deaths just in USA. Now compare the numbers again 41 vs 12,459 Do you remember anything similar to the hype we have now? Why/ Why such different attitude of the media? Update: Mortality rate, so far (what media tells you): in Italy almost 8%, in Spain over 4% (what media doesn\u2019t tell you): in S. Korea 0.9%, in Switzerland 0.6%, in Sweden 0.2%, in Austria 0.1% and in Germany 0.02% In USA around 2% New update (4/7/). Most of \u201cinformation\u201d you can find on this sitCoronavirus Update (Live): 1,365,065 Cases and 76,488 Deaths from COVID-19 Virus Pandemice: However, this information: first) is not reliable, second) wrongly interpreted (for example people think if it give number 1,365,065 it means that is how many people got sick. This is wrong. No, that is how many people got registered as sick. The actual number is much higher) But I got some additional information regarding the ship Diamond Princess. (Right now 11 people died which brings the mortality rate to 1.5%). On that ship 712 persons wee diagnosed with COVID. However only half of them had symptoms. They were discovered only because everybody on the ship was tested. In real life they would not be diagnosed and thus mortality rate would be counted twice higher (from 1.5 to 3%) Another interesting information you can get from the site:Stats of the State of New York It states that in 2017 4,517 people from NY state had died from the regular flu. If we compare to coronavirus we will see similar amount of dead in just 3 months: 4,758. Which tells us that corona is at least 4 times more deadly than the flu. However if you will look at another state - Texas, for example, then you will see that in 2017 almost 1,000 people had died in first 3 moths from the regular flu in comparison to only 151 from coronavirus. So, in other words, seasonal flu was 7 times deadlier than coronavirus. And if you take another very hard coronavirus hit state, like Louisiana, then you will see that in 2017 twice more people had died then from another infectious disease - sepsis than this year from coronavirus. Or, let say, Massachusetts: Flu - 1433, Sepsis - 864, Coronavirus - 260 (so far) In USA during this year flu season: at least 400,000 were already hospitalized and at least 24,000 had died from the flu: Preliminary In-Season 2019-2020 Flu Burden Estimates At this moment 400,000 were diagnosed with the coronavirus and 12,857 died In other words maybe (MAYBE!) coronavirus is indeed more dangerous than other infectious diseases but the difference between them doesn\u2019t warrant those excessive measures which degrade humanity, civil liberties and destroy economies in most of the countries. It is shameful when people out of fear become animals. It is not pandemic of coronavirus, it is pandemic of fear PS (one more) As of today in USA: 560,000 sick, 22,000 died from COVID19 Look at statistics you could see Coronavirus Update (Live): 1,623,175 Cases and 97,236 Deaths from COVID-19 Virus Pandemic : that is 67 person per 1 million in USA died from the coronavirus so far. In 2017 143 persons per 1 million died from the seasonal flu: Deaths influenza and pneumonia U.S. 1950-2017 | Statista Some will say: hold on, the pandemic just started, let see when it will finish, there will be more than 143 by the end. In other words COVID19 is more dangerous than just a flu. Well, that is true if you compare COVID-19 to the flu in 2017. But if you will compare it to the flu in 1950\u20131960-ties than you will see that on average close to 500 persons per million were dying then. The reason for the difference is that back then there was no vaccine for the regular flu. \u201cThat it\u201d - will scream fear mongers - \u201cwe don\u2019t have vaccine for COVID 19 and amount of dead could be the same!\u201d It might be. It might be that amount of dead from the COVID-19 will equal to the amount of dead from the seasonal flu in 1960-ties. But do you remember quarantines in 1960-ties? Did tourism go to a standstill? Do you remember lockdowns, curfews? What is going on now is unprecedented. Not because the disease is any more dangerous than the seasonal flu was in 1960-ties but because of the propaganda, because of ignorance, because people let liberal media to deceive them. ",

            "answer_text": "Understand that what is being done in a majority of countries is now assured to make any recovery from this take longer and longer. As much as 10 years. We are fully committed in the US to not being done with this for at least three or four years. You see, it ends when there is herd immunity. When the virus no longer is a threat to most people and stops being anywhere near as communicative. Could we achieve this with a vaccine? Maybe, but 90% of the people or more would have to take it. There is no way a \u201cgovernment\u201d vaccine is going to be accepted by that much of the population. Then there is the cost. You didn\u2019t think it would be free, did you? Even if it was, I can\u2019t see more than 50\u201360% of the population taking a vaccine with virtually unknown side effects or long term effects. The fact is, not a lot of people die from this, compared to the number that contract it. Yes, it is terrible for those that do die. But it is equally terrible for many, many people to sit by and watch their entire life and livelihood evaporate. Instead of a quarantine of the sick, what we have tried to do is instill fear in the whole population and quarantine everyone. This works, after a fashion, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate the threat, it just pushes it down the road. Now what we have are people running around trying to be \u201cfree\u201d after a period of incarceration. We have people that are convinced that if they get this disease they will die horribly. And we have people with no understanding of how this disease is transmitted trying to tell everyone what they have to do. Sure, it will one day be over. But the only way it ends is after a very large percentage of the population (like 85\u201390%) either gets it and recovers or gets a very, very effective vaccine. Yes, we are going to see around 0.5% of the US population die from this - eventually. No vaccine is going to stop that. ",

            "answer_text": "There are fundamentally three different ways to stop the Covid-19 illness for good. One includes unprecedented limitations on free development and get together, just as forceful testing, to interfere with its transmission totally. That might be unthinkable since the infection is in more than 100 nations. The second is an antibody that could ensure everybody, except it despite everything should be created. A third is possibly viable however unpleasant to consider: simply hold up until enough individuals get it. On the off chance that the infection continues spreading, in the end such huge numbers of individuals will have been contaminated and (on the off chance that they endure) become resistant that the flare-up will flame out all alone as the germ thinks that its increasingly hard to locate a defenseless host. This marvel is known as crowd resistance. You can peruse all our inclusion of the coronavirus/Covid-19 episode for nothing, and furthermore pursue our coronavirus bulletin. Be that as it may, if it's not too much trouble consider buying in to help our not-for-profit news coverage. Wide, relentless spread of the coronavirus is actually a result specialists are displaying in their most pessimistic scenario situations. They state that given what they think about the infection, it could wind up tainting about 60% of the total populace, even inside the year. Those figures are definitely not an irregular speculation. They are educated by where disease transmission specialists state group invulnerability should kick in for this specific infection. A week ago the group invulnerability thought exploded in the features after UK head administrator Boris Johnson demonstrated that nation's legitimate technique may be to put on a solid upper lip and let the infection run its course. The central science consultant to the UK government, Patrick Vallance, said the nation expected to \"develop a crowd resistance so more individuals are safe to this malady and we lessen the transmission.\" Recently, the executive of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, broadcasted a comparable vibe, saying, \"We can hinder the spread of the infection while simultaneously assembling bunch insusceptibility in a controlled manner.\" In any case, going for group insusceptibility immediately would be a grievous methodology, as indicated by the most up to date models. That is on the grounds that such a large number of individuals will turn out to be seriously sick\u2014and an unexpected blast in wiped out individuals requiring medical clinic or ICU care will overpower emergency clinics. The UK this week flagged it would rather accomplish more to stifle the infection, including disheartening social affairs. Backing it off would mean wellbeing frameworks could be saved and lives spared, at the end of the day the outcome could be the equivalent. That is, regardless of whether the pandemic is drawn out after some time, it might at present take crowd insusceptibility to finish it. As Matt Hancock, the UK Secretary for wellbeing and social consideration, explained after analysis of the UK government: \"Group resistance isn't our objective or approach. It's a logical idea.\" However, what precisely is group resistance? At the point when enough of the populace is impervious to a germ, its spread stops normally in light of the fact that insufficient individuals can transmit it. Consequently, the \"group\" is resistant, despite the fact that numerous people inside it despite everything are most certainly not. In spite of the fact that it is unpleasant to ponder the possibility of billions being contaminated by the coronavirus, which has an expected casualty rate for each disease some place around 1% (pdf) (that also is questionable, and the casualty pace of cases raced to the medical clinic is higher), we've seen proof for the rise of group resistance in other late outbreaks.Consider the Zika infection, a mosquito-borne ailment that caused a pestilence alarm in 2015 on account of a connect to birth irregularities. After two years, in 2017, there was never again almost such a great amount to stress over. A Brazilian report found by checking blood tests that 63% of the populace in the northeastern sea shore city of Salvador had just had introduction to Zika; the analysts theorized that group resistance had broken that episode. Antibodies make crowd insusceptibility as well, either when given broadly or once in a while when controlled in a \"ring\" around another instance of an uncommon contamination. That is the manner by which illnesses like smallpox were annihilated and why polio is near being deleted. Different antibody endeavors are in progress for this coronavirus, yet they may not be prepared for over a year. And still, after all that, immunization producers can end up in a losing race with nature to see which ensures the group first. That is partially what occurred in 2017, when medicate creator Sanofi unobtrusively relinquished a Zika antibody being developed subsequent to financing evaporated: there essentially wasn't quite a bit of a market any more. The coronavirus is new, so it doesn't give the idea that anybody is safe to it: that is the thing that allows it to spread and why it can have such extreme impacts in certain individuals. For group insusceptibility to grab hold, individuals must get safe after they are tainted. That happens with numerous germs: individuals who are tainted and recoup become impervious to getting that sickness once more, on the grounds that their insusceptible framework is accused of antibodies ready to overcome it.About 80,000 individuals have recuperated from the coronavirus as of now, and it's reasonable they are currently safe, in spite of the fact that the level of insusceptibility stays obscure. \"I would be astounded, yet not completely amazed, if individuals didn't get insusceptible,\" says Myron Levine, an irresistible illness master at the University of Maryland. Some infections, similar to this season's cold virus, do discover approaches to continue changing, which is the reason insusceptibility against such regular germs isn't finished. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody can predict this, it will very much depend on the actions by each country. But the Epidemic is expected to end very soon (Within 1 year) if the following action taken and implemented effectively: A reliable vaccine. Now both China and United States vaccine is under the clinical trial stage[1].A specific medicine that can cure at least 90% of the affected people. There is a clinical trial of medicine Remdesivir in Feb[2], the result shall be released by end of APR. If it works, the epidemic is expected to be controlled within a few months. As it is a Broad-spectrum antivirus medicine, we may pay close attention to the news about this.Citizen consciousness. As residents of cities, we need to try to do the following: Wash hands frequently or use hand sanitizer, never touch face, nose, mouth, ear without washing hands, stay far away from the crowd, avoid close contact with others, Cover coughs and sneezes, stay at home or wear a mask when you are sick, delay travel and party plans, for more you can read this.[3]Public area control: Government and companies can do a lot of things to prevent the spread of COV-19: Try to let employees work from home, if the jobs are not able to be done at home, let the employees sit at least 1.5 meters away. Measure temperature at least twice a day. Use Thermal Scanner System to scan crowd temperature in public areas and be alert when people with fever detected.Quarantine the suspected cases. Although it might be hard to track all the contacted persons with a confirmed case, Government and big companies should try their best to find out all the suspect cases and quarantine them for at least 14 days and observe them closely. Government and companies can implement technologies to find out people possible infected, such as install CCTV cameras, door access, fingerprint system, information system for data tracking. A good example, Singapore Government has developed an APP called traceTogether[4], it uses smartphone Bluetooth to record who you have contacted and estimate how long you have been in contact with them, it only uses a phone number, and will not save location and neither send info to server. It can effectively track the suspected cases and protect the users\u2019 privacy as well. Our human have the intelligence but virus don\u2019t have, so I\u2019m pretty confident we can defeat the virus.About Herd immunity, I don\u2019t think we can defeat COV-19 with Herd immunity. Reasons are as below: Take smallpox[5] as an example, smallpox has never been defeat before cowpox vaccine is implemented. Before the Cowpox vaccine, people were using the smallpox vaccine, basically, it is using smallpox viruses to infect a healthy person. The death rate is about 1%, even lower than the COV-19 death rate, this can be considered as proactive herd immunity already, but smallpox still lasts thousands of years and killed nearly a billion people. Until the cowpox vaccine is implemented, it is very safe and almost 0% death rate, everybody implements the vaccine, and within a few centuries, the virus is totally wiped out from the world!Unlike smallpox (DNA Virus[6]), COV-19 is an RNA virus[7], it mutates relatively fast, a person who has been infected by the grandfather of COV-19 and recovered, he/she supposed to be immune to the virus, but he/she could be infected again by COV-19 grandson!Too many people will die, as the current death rate is 2\u20133%, and much higher for elder people. If the solution is herd immunity, at least millions of people will die, this is incredible for our modern society and Civilization.In summarize, take the case we humans defeated Smallpox and the example Singapore Government using mobile App to assist suspected case tracking, we human, as a Miracle of Evolution, has the intelligence to defeat any virus, it is just a matter of time and attitude.

            "answer_text": "In 1920, a world wearied by the First World War and sickened by the 1918 flu pandemic desperately sought to move past the struggles and tragedies and start to rebuild lives. People were in search of a \u201creturn to normalcy,\u201d as Warren G. Harding put it. Today, nearly every country finds itself in a similar position. About the authors More than eight months and 900,000 deaths into the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are longing for an end. In our view, there are two important definitions of \u201cend,\u201d each with a separate timeline: An epidemiological end point when herd immunity is achieved. One end point will occur when the proportion of society immune to COVID-19 is sufficient to prevent widespread, ongoing transmission. Many countries are hoping that a vaccine will do the bulk of the work needed to achieve herd immunity. When this end point is reached, the public-health-emergency interventions deployed in 2020 will no longer be needed. While regular revaccinations may be needed, perhaps similar to annual flu shots, the threat of widespread transmission will be gone.A transition to a form of normalcy. A second (and likely, earlier) end point will occur when almost all aspects of social and economic life can resume without fear of ongoing mortality (when a mortality rate is no longer higher than a country\u2019s historical average) or long-term health consequences related to COVID-19. The process will be enabled by tools such as vaccination of the highest-risk populations; rapid, accurate testing; improved therapeutics; and continued strengthening of public-health responses. The next normal won\u2019t look exactly like the old it might be different in surprising ways, with unexpected contours, and getting there will be gradual but the transition will enable many familiar scenes, such as air travel, bustling shops, humming factories, full restaurants, and gyms operating at capacity, to resume.The two ends are related, of course, but not linearly. At the latest, the transition to normal will come when herd immunity is reached. But in regions with strong public-health responses, normalcy can likely come significantly before the epidemiological end of the pandemic. The timeline to achieve the ends will vary by location. In this article, we\u2019ll explain the criteria that will be key factors in determining when each is reached. In the United States and most other developed economies, the epidemiological end point is most likely to be achieved in the third or fourth quarter of 2021, with the potential to transition to normalcy sooner, possibly in the first or second quarter of 2021. Every day matters. Beyond the impatience that most feel to resume normal life, the longer it takes to remove the constraints on our economies, the greater will be the economic damage.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that anybody knows that for certain. There are about 325 million people in the US, and close to 8 million confirmed cases. What we don\u2019t know is how many people have had asymptomatic cases, and that number could be as high 131 million. I\u2019m getting that by taking 40% of people positive who didn\u2019t know that they\u2019d had it as there were in a study in New York. So adding the confirmed cases and the asymptomatic cases together is about 140 million, if I\u2019m at all accurate. That\u2019s 43% of our population. At one point, the experts were saying that herd immunity happens at 70\u201375%. So, if that\u2019s right, that would happen when 30% more of us will have had it which would be 97,500 of us, with 39,000 of us without any symptoms. So that\u2019s 58,500 who would have some symptoms although not necessarily becoming ver sick. If 8% of the symptomatic people die (which I think is high but it\u2019s an average of the past two weeks according to the CDC), that would be 4,680. If any of this is right, that will give a mortality total of about 215,000 people who will die in the US from Covid. My numbers would certainly be wrong somewhere along the line since I\u2019m not a statistician, but that\u2019s far below the 2 million or thereabouts that they were predicting at the beginning. And, if you take into account that 5 million people are in nursing homes or assisted living situations undoubtedly with comorbidities, I think we\u2019ve done pretty darn well given the hype about this. Of course, if you or a loved one is the one who dies of it, your morbidity would be 100% so this is just looking at numbers, and not necessarily very accurate ones. What this comes down to for me is that when we get to that 215,000 death total, this thing should be ending on its own. While cases are going up, the death rate is going down substantially which is great. Unless we get a huge spike in deaths over the fall and winter, we\u2019re more than halfway to herd immunity without a vaccine. With an effective and safe vaccine, we might be pretty darn close right now. If my numbers are wrong, I would be happy to know. ",

The death toll is starting to rise and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end? The WHO will likely declare the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop significantly throughout the world. But exactly when that happens depends onwhat global governments choose to do next. They have three main options: Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, or Coordinate and Crush. One is widely considered best, and it may not be the one you think. In the first, governments and communities do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed as quickly as possible. Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about how to save their patients, and hospitals reach peak capacity almost immediately. Somewhere in the range of millions to hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus or the collapse of health care systems. Soon the majority of people have been infected and either perished or survivedby building up their immune responses. Around this point herd immunity kicks in, where the virus can no longerfind new hosts. So the pandemic fizzles out a short time after it began. But there\u2019s another way to create herd immunity without such a high cost of life. Let\u2019s reset the clock to the moment the WHO declared the pandemic. This time, governments and communitiesaround the world slow the spread of the virus to give research facilities time to produce a vaccine. They buy this crucial time through tacticsthat may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected and people they\u2019ve interacted with, and physical distancing. Even with these measures in place, the virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands of deaths. Some cities get the outbreak under controland go back to business as usual, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing when a new case passes through. Within the next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become widely, and hopefully freely, available thanks to a worldwide effort. Once 40-90% of the population has received it\u2014 the precise amount varying based on the virus\u2014 herd immunity kicks in, and the pandemic fizzles out. Let\u2019s rewind the clock one more time, to consider the final strategy: Coordinate and Crush. The idea here is to simultaneously starvethe virus, everywhere, through a combination of quarantine, social distancing, and restricting travel. The critical factor is to synchronize responses. In a typical pandemic, when one country is peaking, another may be getting its first cases. Instead of every leader responding to what\u2019s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world as the giant interconnected system it is. If coordinated properly, this could end a pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of life. But unless the virus is completely eradicated\u2014 which is highly unlikely\u2014 there will be risks of it escalating to pandemic levels once again. And factors like animals carrying and transmitting the virus might undermine our best efforts altogether. So which strategy is best for this deadly,infectious respiratory virus? Racing through it is a quick fix, but would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all if people can be reinfected. Crushing the virus through Coordination alone is also enticing for its speed, but only reliable with true and nearly impossible global cooperation. That\u2019s why vaccination, assisted by as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner; it\u2019s the slow, steady, and proven option in the race. Even if the pandemic officially ends before a vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so vaccines will continue to protect people. And although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people\u2019s lives won\u2019t necessarily last the full duration. Breakthroughs in treatment and prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme containment measures. Take heart: the pandemic will end. Its legacy will be long-lasting,but not all bad; the breakthroughs, social services, and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone. And if we take inspiration from the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential pandemic so contained that our children\u2019s children won\u2019t even know its name.

            "answer_text": "One possibility, historians say, is that the coronavirus pandemic could end socially before it ends medically.  Agencies According to historians, pandemics typically have two types of endings: the medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes. \u201cWhen people ask, \u2018When will this end?,\u2019 they are asking about the social ending,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Greene, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins. In other words, an end can occur not because a disease has been vanquished but because people grow tired of panic mode and learn to live with a disease. Allan Brandt, a Harvard historian, said something similar was happening with Covid-19: \u201cAs we have seen in the debate about opening the economy, many questions about the so-called end are determined not by medical and public health data but by sociopolitical processes.\u201d Endings \u201care very, very messy,\u201d said Dora Vargha, a historian at the University of Exeter. \u201cLooking back, we have a weak narrative. For whom does the epidemic end, and who gets to say?\u201d In the Path of Fear An epidemic of fear can occur even without an epidemic of illness. Dr. Susan Murray, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, saw that firsthand in 2014 when she was a fellow at a rural hospital in Ireland. In the preceding months, more than 11,000 people in West Africa had died from Ebola, a terrifying viral disease that was highly infectious and often fatal. The epidemic seemed to be waning, and no cases had occurred in Ireland, but the public fear was palpable. Murray wrote, \u201cIf we are not prepared to fight fear and ignorance as actively and as thoughtfully as we fight any other virus, it is possible that fear can do terrible harm to vulnerable people, even in places that never see a single case of infection during an outbreak. And a fear epidemic can have far worse consequences when complicated by issues of race, privilege and language.\u201d  Black Death and Dark MemoriesBubonic plague has struck several times in the past 2,000 years, killing millions of people and altering the course of history. Each epidemic amplified the fear that came with the next outbreak. The disease is caused by a strain of bacteria, Yersinia pestis, that lives on fleas that live on rats. But bubonic plague, which became known as the Black Death, also can be passed from infected person to infected person through respiratory droplets, so it cannot be eradicated simply by killing rats. Historians describe three great waves of plague, said Mary Fissell, a historian at Johns Hopkins: the Plague of Justinian, in the sixth century; the medieval epidemic, in the 14th century; and a pandemic that struck in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The medieval pandemic began in 1331 in China. The illness, along with a civil war that was raging at the time, killed half the population of China. From there, the plague moved along trade routes to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In the years between 1347 and 1351, it killed at least one-third of the European population. Half the population of Siena, Italy, died. \u201cIt is impossible for the human tongue to recount the awful truth,\u201d wrote 14th-century chronicler Agnolo di Tura. \u201cIndeed, one who did not see such horribleness can be called blessed.\u201d The infected, he wrote, \u201cswell beneath the armpits and in their groins and fall over while talking.\u201d The dead were buried in pits, in piles. In Florence, Italy, wrote Giovanni Boccaccio, \u201cNo more respect was accorded to dead people than would nowadays be accorded to dead goats.\u201d Some hid in their homes. Others refused to accept the threat. Their way of coping, Boccaccio wrote, was to \u201cdrink heavily, enjoy life to the full, go round singing and merrymaking, and gratify all of one\u2019s cravings when the opportunity emerged, and shrug the whole thing off as one enormous joke.\u201d That pandemic ended, but the plague recurred. One of the worst outbreaks began in China in 1855 and spread worldwide, killing more than 12 million in India alone. Health authorities in Mumbai, India, burned whole neighborhoods trying to rid them of the plague. \u201cNobody knew if it made a difference,\u201d Yale historian Frank Snowden said. It is not clear what made the bubonic plague die down. Some scholars have argued that cold weather killed the disease-carrying fleas, but that would not have interrupted the spread by the respiratory route, Snowden noted. Or perhaps it was a change in the rats. By the 19th century, the plague was being carried not by black rats but by brown rats, which are stronger, more vicious and more likely to live apart from humans. \u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t want one for a pet,\u201d Snowden said. Another hypothesis is that the bacterium evolved to be less deadly. Or maybe actions by humans, such as the burning of villages, helped quell the epidemic. The plague never really went away. In the United States, infections are endemic among prairie dogs in the Southwest and can be transmitted to people. Snowden said that one of his friends became infected after a stay at a hotel in New Mexico. The previous occupant of his room had a dog, which had fleas that carried the microbe. Such cases are rare and can now be successfully treated with antibiotics, but any report of a case of the plague stirs up fear. How Will COVID-19 End? People may grow so tired of the restrictions that they declare the pandemic over, even as the virus continues to smolder in the population and before a vaccine or effective treatment is found. \u201cI think there is this sort of social psychological issue of exhaustion and frustration,\u201d Yale historian Naomi Rogers said. \u201cWe may be in a moment when people are just saying, \u2018That\u2019s enough. I deserve to be able to return to my regular life.\u2019\u201d It is happening already; in some states, governors have lifted restrictions, allowing hair salons, nail salons and gyms to reopen, in defiance of warnings by public health officials that such steps are premature. As the economic catastrophe wreaked by the lockdowns grows, more and more people may be ready to say \u201cenough.\u201d \u201cThere is this sort of conflict now,\u201d Rogers said. Public health officials have a medical end in sight, but some members of the public see a social end. \u201cWho gets to claim the end?\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIf you push back against the notion of its ending, what are you pushing back against? What are you claiming when you say, \u2018No, it is not ending.\u2019\u201d The challenge, Brandt said, is that there will be no sudden victory. Trying to define the end of the pandemic \u201cwill be a long and difficult process.\u201d Hope this helps\ud83d\ude0a [1] Footnotes[1] When will the coronavirus pandemic end, and how?",

            "answer_text": "A few years at best and more like a few decades and at worst, well how good is your imagination. Zombies, collapse of the world\u2019s economies. The best scenario is based on, if people, all suddenly smarten up and all keep their faces covered by a mask when shopping for food or medication only and when close to strangers, keep away from strangers, like two meters and wash their hands after touching a commonly touched surface. And otherwise, stay home as long as possible. If just that is done for four or five years then, and only then, will we get out of this pandemic in reasonable shape, meaning somewhat the same as before the pandemic started. The more likely scenario is that people who, consider themselves better than others, who will continue in not doing those basic four points and gather in large groups close together, and therefore keep spreading the virus but, with implementation of stronger and stronger and harsher and harsher controls and penalties then, a lesser and lesser rate of contagion will ensue until it becomes a barely noticeable background story that keeps popping up of, small groups getting infected. If too many get ever more nervous, just because they are not getting out as much as they would like then, there will continue to be large pockets of contagion that will just keep the contagion curve up too high to control, even when very strict controls and very high level penalties are used. There might be a levelling off, of the contagion curve, at a too high a level that, gets pushed up from one side by those who just have to take their masks off too often, get out too often where there are too many others and pushed down on the other side, by ever more information bites being put out by authorities, by ever tighter controls and increasing greater and heavier penalties. That high curve will, just by being high, force more and more people to get more desperate, ending in increasing suicide rates, besides the death rate from being infected. That is the worse or worst way that it will all go. It might be even worse, so that more and more people will just give up on trying and just go out, and the devil take the hindmost. That attitude is also possible. So take your pick. Either act responsibly and it should all get a bit better as time goes by. Or do not act responsibly and it will not get better. That choice is not just about making choices, but also about inner strength and how much one is willing to put up with short term but increasingly worsening lack of a decent life style. Four years of doing those four points is a long time, like being in jail for no good reason. The other side in this is, to consider that there are places in the world where people live like this all their life because of poverty and other forces beyond their control. Right now that is beginning to apply to more and more of us. That also can be a learning experience, to teach us that life is not always about a good time, progress, a good career or doing whatever one wants. So reality sometimes sucks. What can be done about it? We know what to do, so do it. ",

            "answer_text": "The scenario I visualize is that first, we will see several drugs, including resveratrol, cholorquinine, and others begin to be available that greatly increase the number of people who survuve the virus. That will enormously encourage the markets; they will begin to form a bottom, and we won\u2019t be seeing the huge spikes downward. Instead, there will gradually be a few days where the buyers come back into the market and we gradually see it go back up. By then, some time in the middle of April (give or take a week or so), the numbers of new cases of the virus will begin to go down, and President Trump and most states will start encouraging healthy people to go back to work. People in poor health and older will be asked to stay home, but the rest of the economy will gradually be returning to work. By May, particularly in warmer areas, the number of COVID-19 patients will fall sharply because the virus doesn\u2019t like hot temperatures. As the summer progresses, most of the country will be returning to work, and the number of new cases and fatalities will be dropping sharply. At some point, it\u2019s hard to say when but I\u2019m inclined to think sometime in July, the economy will be coming back strongly in many areas and in many industries. It will be tentative at first because there will be concern that as soon as it begins to get cold again, COVID-19 will be roaring back in, but since testing is now widely available and fewer and fewer really severe cases are occurring people will be cutiously optimistic. Unemployment will fall to almost what it was in February, and the stock market will begin to move back up, but still gradually. In late September, especially in the northern part of the country, COVID-19 does begin to come back, but it is definitely a weaker form. The stock market moves strongly upward with three or four of the stongest days in history. By December, it appears that the US is mostly over the COVID-19 crisis, as is the rest of the world. This is obviously one person\u2019s fantasy; it is a best case scenario, but it is a reasonably possible one. ",

Take Small Pox\u2026it was not that long ago that the WHO declared it eradicated\u2026same for polio\u2026and then, in pockets where they were no longer vaccinating the masses pockets of outbreaks of these diseases have recurred. There are many viruses we have HIGHLY controlled. (The Measles vaccine is ALMOST 100% effective) and as such is very rare in regions where vaccination is high. And the immunity created by vaccines in these cases are VERY long lasting (As in few, if any booster shots needed in the future)Other viruses are less well controlled by vaccines, Like the flu, for instance. It mutates easily and has multiple variants that EACH can infect a person even if they had a different \u201cflu\u201d in the past\u2026and the immunity to flu wanes in roughly 1 year, even when obtained by getting a flu shot. Which is WHY you need one every year, to give you protection form the newest versions and even then Flu shots are only about 75% effective, so you MIGHT still get it, but a less severe case. COVID-19 is a corona virus (SARS-COV2) COMPLETELY different in genetic makeup even from the SARS that swept the world a few years back (Which was similar enough to other corona viruses to have many in the world at least having a HINT of an immune response already in their system.) So right now, with this one being NOVEL (meaning COMPLETELY new/different) we have ZERO people in the world who had immunity to this at the outset\u2026and it is beginning to look as if immunity could very well be VERY short lived.

The longer term goal is for a vaccine as effective as Measles vaccines are) But no matter what, we will NOT be able to be over the current pandemic until there is a vaccine AND enough get it OR 70% of the population catches the virus\u2026So we are looking at a MINIMUM of 1 year more highly likely it will be longer. (The Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 did NOT end until the middle of 1920\u2026most don\u2019t know this) So if my analysis of the current medical world news is correct, we most likely will not be able to ditch the face masks and social distancing until at LEAST Christmas of 2021\u2026and even then, there will always be SOME COVID happening in pockets just like other diseases have, OR it will be similar to Flu and we have waves annually..and the COVID shot to make it more like a flu season.

            "answer_text": "In order to return to normal life, we will all have to find ways to boost our natural immunity against infection. COVID-19 is a more virulent, and a very much more infectious, version of the influenza that occurs world-wide every year towards the end of the winter - examples of which are SARS and MERS. A vaccine is never going to prevent the next strain of Influenza, since vaccines take many months to develop and we are always chasing ways to stop the last pandemic - not the next one We are not going to learn from the medical profession or government about these natural ways to boost our immunity, since most modern doctors do not understand anything which is not a licensed drug. I have spent 10 years interacting with many UK scientific advisory committees including NICE, and none of them can cope with \"Diet and Lifestyle\" - because they don't understand it. - An example of this is a doctor who proudly told me that \"I know nothing about Nutrition\" - how sad and dangerous ! - Another is an eye surgeon who told me that she does not give advice about Omega-3 - because \"Vitamins are dangerous\" Dr Andrew Saul maintains that we should take much larger amounts of Vitamin C - when we are stressed or ill He also reports how the Chinese and many USA hospitals are now using IV Vitamin C as first-line treatment for COVID-19. ( Andrew Saul's Natural Health Website ) Dr Cicero Coimbra, Dr William Grant and Henry Lahore show strong evidence that high levels of Vitamin D boost our natural immunity against the annual Influenza - and COVID-19 - and help to fight the cytokine storm ( Vitamin D WOW facts | ) Dr Sarah Myhill suggests that we should inhale iodine vapour, since that coats our nasal passages and upper airways with an antiseptic that kills the virus when we breathe it in ( DoctorMyhill ) Dr Paul Marik has a protocol involving Vitamin C, Vitamin B1 and steroids that have a synergistic effect in treating Sepsis, that also helps to treat Influenza and Pneumonia. https://www.evms.edu/about_evms/administrative_offices/marketing_communications/publications/issue_9_4/sepsis.php Dr Joseph Mercola has published \"10-Tips to Beat Coronavirus\" that add several foods, traditional herbal remedies and supplements, such as Elderberry, Spirulina, Beta Glucans, Glucosamine, Selenium, Zinc, Alpha Lipoic Acid and Sulphoraphane, plus Zinc and the traditional herbal remedy Echinacia ( Mercola.com - #1 Natural Health Website ) We are not going to hear about these ways to build immunity from the medical profession, because the doctors in NICE in the UK do not understand them and the FDA in USA has banned anyone making claims for treatment or prevention using anything but licensed drugs. Also Google and Facebook altered their search algorithms in June 2019 to block any claims that do not use licensed drugs, mostly as part of their war against Fake News but possibly to keep the advertising revenue from the drug companies. Many of the general public do understand some of these natural methods of boosting our immunity, including how sunlight is the best disinfectant - except that the dermatologists have taken over the lunatic asylum and told us to stay out of the sun ! So if we aren't going to hear these messages from our doctors or our search engines or social media or the mainstream media, where and how are we going to learn about ways to prevent infection from COVID-19 and the next version ?

            "answer_text": "How and when will this pandemic end? We asked a virologist We may be approaching a saturation point in terms of coronavirus infections in some of the worst-hit countries. Eventually, the virus will run out of people to infect.But there are still many unknowns when it comes to this virus. We spoke to Belgian virologist Guido Vanham, the former head of virology at the Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, and asked him: how will this pandemic end? And on which factors might that depend? More than one-third of the world's population is now in lockdown as the world battles the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. How will this pandemic end? Guido Vanham (GV): It will probably never end, in the sense that this virus is clearly here to stay unless we eradicate it. And the only way to eradicate such a virus would be with a very effective vaccine that is delivered to every human being. We have done that with smallpox, but that's the only example - and that has taken many years. So it will most probably stay. It belongs to a family of viruses that we know - the coronaviruses - and one of the questions now is whether it will behave like those other viruses. It may reappear seasonally - more in the winter, spring and autumn and less in the early summer. So we will see whether that will have an impact. But at some point in this epidemic - and certainly in the countries that are most affected, like Italy and Spain - there will be saturation, because according to predictions, up to 40% percent of the Spanish and 26% of the Italian population are or have been infected already. And, of course, when you go over 50% or so, even without doing anything else, the virus just has fewer people to infect - and so the epidemic will come down naturally. And that's what happened in in all the previous epidemics when we didn't have any [treatments]. The rate of infection and the number of those susceptible will determine when that happens. What are some of the factors at play? What do we know, and what don't we know? GV: The first thing we know, of course, is that it's a very infectious virus - that's probably something that every inhabitant of the world knows. But what is not known is the infectious dose - how many viruses you need to produce an infection - and that will be very difficult to know unless we perform experimental infections. And we know people develop antibodies. That has been clearly shown in China, but we are not yet sure how protective these antibodies are. There is no convincing evidence yet that people who have recovered get ill again after a few days or weeks - so most probably, the antibodies are at least partially protective. But how long will that protection last for - is it a matter of months or years? The epidemiology in the future will depend on that - on the level of protective immunity that you get at the population level after this wave of infections, which we cannot really stop. We can mitigate it, we can flatten the curve, but we cannot really stop it because at some point we will have to come out of our houses again and go to work and school. Nobody really knows when that will be. The virus will take its course and there will be a certain level of immunity - but the answer to how long that will last will determine the periodicity and the amplitude of the epidemics to come. Unless, of course, we find a way to block it in a year or so from now with an effective vaccine. The number of new cases outside China appears to be on the wane (Image: Worldometer) There is also an unresolved question about what determines an individual's susceptibility to this disease. Of course there is age, but that\u2019s not so surprising. People\u2019s immune systems weaken with age. But then there is this concept of co-morbidities, which means that some people, even younger people, get ill because they have other diseases. It's logical that when you have cancer or diabetes, that you are more susceptible to infections. But what is remarkable - what we do not really understand - is that people with simple hypertension are also very vulnerable to developing this disease. So that's one of the unresolved questions. And it will be interesting to see what the profile is of people who are infected but do not get ill. We will know in a few months - that question is already being addressed in China. Then you can go back and test for antibodies, because it looks as though everyone who has gone through the infection will develop antibodies - and that those will remain for a while. There are people that have antibodies and have not presented to to the medical services and claim that they have been healthy all the time. What's the genetic profile of those people as compared with the people who went to the medical wards? That is an interesting question. One hint has already been discovered in China; your blood group could be important. It\u2019s very preliminary data, but in a year or so from now we will have a lot of data on that as well. This is one virologist\u2019s view of how the pandemic could end ",
