            "answer_text": "Happiness Runs by Donovan Leitch is the happiest song I've ever heard, as the melody and lyrics [1] remind me of the delightful sound of clear water in a brook burbling along, over smooth stones. There is the 'ear worm' aspect of the melody combined with the lyrics in the chorus: \"Happiness runs in a circular motion Thought is like a little boat upon the sea.Everybody is a part of everything anyway,You can have everything if you let yourself be...\" The melody is inspirational, too.  Here, above, is a youTube version I find particularly delightful to watch, as I listen to the happiest song I've ever heard. Edited June 7, 2019 to add: I just returned from my shift at a hospital where a dear friend is in excruciating pain and is having emergency abdominal surgery to remove a large unknown mass. She is a mother-mentor to me, and I love her. We speak our truths. She wanted me there with her and her now adult children. She wanted me to stay with her and hold her hand so she wouldn\u2019t be alone and in pain when they went out to eat dinner. I did. I was very sad as I held her too-thin hand and read out loud to her until she fell asleep. Arriving home at midnight, drained, sad and exhausted, I played this simple tune over and over again in the dark of night and despair, crying at first, and hoping to lift my low spirits. Listening to this simple affirmative song over and over again was calming and centering; it allowed me to process the inputs of being in that overwhelming hospital, which is my least favorite place on this planet. It worked. I slept like a baby. Thanks, Donovan Leitch! [1] HAPPINESS RUNS LYRICS - DONOVAN LEITCH ",
