            "answer_text": "John Lennon and Elton John were very good friends. They even recorded together just for the fun of it. Elton was devastated at the death of John Lennon. So he did what most people try to do \u2014 he vented his grief in a way that came naturally to him. He wrote a song for John. RIP John. Empty Garden by Elton John and Bernie Taupin What happened hereAs the New York sunset disappearedI found an empty garden among the flagstones there Who lived hereHe must have been a gardener that cared a lotWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop And now it all looks strangeIt's funny how one insect can damage so much grain And what's it forThis little empty garden by the brownstone doorAnd in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more Who lived hereHe must have been a gardener that cared a lotWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazedA gardener like that one, no one can replace And I've been knockingBut no one answersAnd I've been knockingMost all the day Oh, and I've been callingOh, hey hey JohnnyCan't you come out to play And through their tearsSome say he farmed his best in younger yearsBut he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear Who lived thereHe must have been a gardener that cared a lotWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop Now we pray for rain and with every drop that fallsWe hear, we hear your name And I've been knockingBut no one answersAnd I've been knockingMost all the day Oh, and I've been callingOh, hey hey JohnnyCan't you come out to play And I've been knockingBut no one answersAnd I've been knockingMost all the day Oh, and I've been callingOh, hey hey JohnnyCan't you come out, can't you come out to play Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty gardenJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty gardenJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden ",

Today, my selection is \u201cThunder Road\u201d by Bruce Springsteen. \"Thunder Road\" The screen door slamsMary's dress wavesLike a vision she dances across the porchAs the radio plays Roy Orbison singing for the lonelyHey that's me and I want you onlyDon't turn me home againI just can't face myself alone again Don't run back insideDarling, you know just what I'm here forSo you're scared and you're thinkingThat maybe we ain't that young anymore Show a little faith there's magic in the nightYou ain't a beauty but hey you're alrightOh and that's alright with me You can hide 'neath your coversAnd study your painMake crosses from your loversThrow roses in the rain Waste your summer praying in vainFor a saviour to rise from these streets Well now I'm no heroThat's understoodAll the redemption I can offer girlIs beneath this dirty hood With a chance to make it good somehowHey what else can we do nowExcept roll down the windowAnd let the wind blow back your hair?Well the night's busting openThese two lanes will take us anywhere We got one last chance to make it realTo trade in these wings on some wheelsClimb in backHeaven's waiting down on the tracks Oh-oh come take my handWe're riding out tonight to case the promised landOh-oh-oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road Lying out there like a killer in the sunHey I know it's late we can make it if we runOh-oh-oh Thunder Road, sit tight, take holdThunder Road Well I got this guitarAnd I learned how to make it talkAnd my car's out backIf you're ready to take that long walk From your front porch to my front seatThe door's open but the ride ain't freeAnd I know you're lonelyFor words that I ain't spokenBut tonight we'll be freeAll the promises'll be broken There were ghosts in the eyesOf all the boys you sent awayThey haunt this dusty beach roadIn the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets They scream your name at night in the streetYour graduation gown lies in rags at their feetAnd in the lonely cool before dawnYou hear their engines roaring onWhen you get to the porch they're goneOn the wind So Mary climb inIt's a town full of losersAnd I'm pulling out of here to win ",
