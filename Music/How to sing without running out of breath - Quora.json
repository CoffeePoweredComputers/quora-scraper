            "answer_text": "You need a teacher to help you figure out why you are running out of breath. A lot of things you are doing while singing will affect how well you can sustain the line you are singing, without dying out before the end of a phrase. There are a ton of things to check for, but some main culprits for untrained singers are: poor posture (straight up but relaxed with head normally slightly forward is appropriate, not poker straight)not taking breaths low into the body, also called belly breathing (some singers lift their shoulders incorrectly)lack of intercostal muscle strength (between the ribs, that help hold it open, this takes work to build the strength for control)breathing too deeply (the air will then be under more pressure to rush out and get wasted too quickly)breathing too shallowly (not enough air is let it, you shouldn\u2019t have to suck the air in, if you open your ribcage, it should just come in effortlessly for each intake of breath, quietly)not taking small breaths when needed, even mid-line if needed (yes, that means you might sing with a gap in a place that the song doesn\u2019t seem to have, but it takes training to build the stamina for long sustains)not keeping even air pressure (legato singing means you should sing evenly unless there is a reason to emphasize somewhere, and that evenness can be at varying dynamics - imagine a stepped platform, but each platform is flat, not sloped or bumpy - when you sing a song that starts soft and has a crescendo for a consecutive verse or refrain, you have to maintain that new level unless it\u2019s supposed to decrescendo again)singing too carefully, the lack of air pressure will make it even harder to sing (consistent flow is how natural vibrato gets produced - if you don\u2019t blow enough air, the vocal folds don\u2019t vibrate as fast)breathy singing, other than occasionally for stylistic purposes (this includes falsetto with incomplete cord closure)pushing the sound, creating tension (this is a huge bucket of problems with strain and learning to remove tension from the voice, including tongue, lips, mouth, jaw, larynx, throat, and the body in general)not singing connected notes out of the same space (this is harder to explain and I would consider this a more advanced concept, work on the other things first)diction and vowel tuning can affect the efficiency of airflow (there are some other answers around the distance between the vowels when singing)lack of understanding of vocal technique (how can you do it right if you don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re supposed to do it)lack of awareness (if you can\u2019t feel the differences, you may not be able to fix it)When you are singing a single phrase, any one of these things can throw off the rest of the phrase. It may seem like you\u2019re doing fine until you get to the end, but most likely you broke the flow of air somewhere earlier in the phrase can can\u2019t recover from it. ",
