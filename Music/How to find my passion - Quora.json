            "answer_text": "Ever say to yourself, \"If I could just figure out what I'm really passionate about, everything else will take off\"? If so, you're not alone. One of the most common stumbling blocks to launching a passion-based life is figuring out what you're passionate about in the first place. Sadly, many of us go about finding our passion in the wrong way. How? By thinking about it. We're habituated to use our minds to analyze, rationalize and figure things out. It's natural yet oooooh so torturesome. Common techniques to find passion include: Taking expensive psychological testsRecalling childhood interestsSitting at Starbucks watching your friend's eyes glaze over after asking questions like \"I don't know...what do you think I should do?\"Here's the problem: Passion can't be found in your head because it lives in your heart. And the flames of passion are fanned by engagement, not thought. Juicy, right? Here's what I mean: No matter how hard you try, you cannot figure out your passion by thinking about it. You need to take action and feel your way to your truth, from the inside out. For example, for years, before I stepped foot in a dance studio, I often wondered about dancing hip-hop. But most of my thoughts sounded like this: \"Wow...dancing professionally would be awesome, but you're too old to get started. Most pros start training when they're 5. You've had zero professional training, and you're already in your 20s. Get real.\" Or, \"It sounds exciting, but dance as a career is crazy and irresponsible. There's no money in that. You studied business finance, so you should do something more stable and related to what you know.\" The endless and debilitating chatter in our minds often tries to talk us out of what our hearts are yearning to explore. The first time I took a class in a professional dance setting, I started to cry (happy tears, of course) because actually doing it felt right. No matter how much I wondered about it before, it wasn't until I physically took action that my real passion (and gift) for dance fully emerged. And from taking action rather than staying in my head, I was able to carve out a little niche for myself in the hybrid world of dance and fitness. Rather than following traditional hip-hop dancer goals (like going on tour with major recording artists or auditioning for music videos), I was asked to become one of the world's first Nike Elite Dance Athletes\u2014a category Nike created after I got started. Not to get too woo-woo on you, but magic really does start to happen when you follow your heart. Embrace this key idea and it will change your life: Clarity comes from engagement, not thought. But taking action on something you suspect to be your passion is just part of the story. There's another important (and rarely discussed) piece to the passion puzzle. And this, my friend, is the fastest, most powerful way to turn what you love into a business or career that can sustain you. Ready? Proactively bring passion to everything you touch, to everything you do. No matter what task is in front of you, bring as much enthusiasm and energy to it as you possibly can. Bring your full attention, your full presence, the Godlike quality that each of us has within, to every task in your day. Whether you're brushing your teeth, making love or cleaning the kitty litter\u2014do it like you want to do it. When you make this shift, you'll ignite business ideas and creative insights far beyond what your thinking mind alone is capable of. And let's face it. Passion is contagious. When you're fully present and passionately engaged with your life, people around you take notice and want in on whatever you're doing. Want more? Another side benefit to proactive passion is kicking life-sucking habits like procrastination, resistance and complaining straight to the curb. Now that you're armed with an understanding of passion, do the following four steps to unleash yours. 4 Steps to Find Your Passion 1. Love everything you do. From this moment forward, if you don't like something, you've got two choices: stop doing it (quit, delegate it, hire it out) OR love it with all your heart. Anything else is madness. When you commit to love everything you do, you strengthen your \"passion muscles\" from the inside out and open up a divine channel so that what you're meant to do can be revealed. Remember, we human beings are creatures of habit. You can't be whiny, complainy and miserable for 80 percent of your day and expect to be enthusiastic and passionate in the last 20 percent. And if you're feeling really stuck on this whole \"finding your passion\" thing, this is the fastest way to get your motor running. Know this: Truly successful people are never the victim of their circumstances. They realize they have ultimate power in any situation and take responsibility for their experience. Don't forget: In any given moment, if you can't change what you're doing, you can always change how you're doing it. 2. Look at your book collection, magazines, DVDs, CDs and credit card statements. Notice any themes? What subjects are you constantly gravitating toward? What are you already spending your time, money and energy on? What thread(s) have been recurring in your life again and again? As best as you can, check in with your heart and physical body, not your head. Anything \"light you up\" so to speak? Do you feel a sense of expansion in your body? Do you feel excitement (or perhaps even a little fear) when you imagine a certain topic or possibility? Those are all good signs. Remember, our passions are often irrational and war with logic and reason. That's why it's important to shift your attention into your heart and your physical body when exploring these questions. Your heart and physical body contain wisdom far beyond the capacity of your mind. 3. What do you love to talk about, learn about and/or teach others about? This is a really useful question. Don't edit yourself here. With nearly 7 billion people on the planet, chances are that there's a market out there hungry for information, products or resources on your topic. Or there's a company looking for someone with your unique set of gifts and interests to join their team. If you're having trouble coming up with ideas, ask close friends and family (the honest ones) what you never seem to shut up about. Also, don't underestimate the power of incorporating your passion into your already existing career or business. You may not need a total overhaul in what you're doing. Maybe you simply need to inject more of what you LOVE into your life right now. For example, Nathalie, a raw-food expert, recently rediscovered her passion for growing trees. Now she's giving a portion of her revenue to not-for-profit tree organizations and is building this component into her existing brand. With that tiny tweak, she just gave herself a competitive advantage over other raw-food experts who aren't passionate about any cause (or brave enough to share it), and she is way more motivated to market and sell her products and services because they're tied to making a bigger difference in the world. 4. Quit talking and start doing. Now that you've gotten this far, the next step is to begin taking consistent passion-based action each day. That could mean writing, making videos, recording audios, taking a class or somehow engaging in an activity you love. And here's the best part. Taking action on your passion often requires little to no cash outlay. Articles, videos and writing take no money. Only time, effort and focus. And beginner classes can often be inexpensive or, sometimes, even free. Building your life around what you love is something you'll never regret. It's your passion for what you do that will give you the drive, commitment and energy necessary to create any amount of success and fulfillment you desire, and you'll have an extraordinary time while you do it. That\u2019s everything you need to know about finding your passion and probably a little more because I just can\u2019t help myself, I\u2019m passionate about sharing this work with you. Now go ahead and get started and don\u2019t forget to let me know how it goes! Good luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "You actually don\u2019t find a passion for your life, as much as you discover what your passions are. When you know your passions, as well as knowing who you are, you create a life filled with passion. You allow your truth to guide you in the decisions you make, and ultimately, the life you create for yourself. Many people have the feeling that life drags them around or determines their happiness, or even their life circumstances. What they don\u2019t realize, is that you have the power to create your own life and therefore, you level of happiness or joy. It sound simplistic, and in actuality it is. But there\u2019s definitely effort, as well as courage involved. The easy thing is to just follow the status quo - to do what everyone else says you should do, or what everyone else is doing. That leads to a life-humbling experience, and in many cases even depression because when you do that, you\u2019re so far out of alignment with what makes you feel alive, that it creates an inner turmoil. So how do you go about doing this? Start by looking at what you either like, or love. If you can\u2019t get to the place just yet or what really excites you, or what you love, then go with what interests you or what you like. This is just a directional indication. When you give yourself permission to explore what you like (or love), you find yourself led in new directions - trying new things. You start to open up to possibilities - exposing yourself to new experiences, people, or opportunities. One of the best things you can do is to learn to tune into your inner wisdom. Your gut instinct. What \u201cfeels\u201d right? What feels \u201coff\u201d? When you being to get a feel for that, your decisions become more authentic for what\u2019s right for you. This is the important part - what\u2019s right for you! Not for me, not for your neighbored, best friend, or colleague. Because what\u2019s right for you is exactly what will lead you to be a better person, expand your horizon, and even make a much bigger difference in the world. The process of discovering your passion and then allowing yourself to do it is a multi-layered process. The more you work on it, the better for you - the better results you\u2019ll find you have. There are several steps, but mostly they\u2019re: Give yourself permission to dream, to imagine and to look at what pulls you - what excites you and gets your heart beating faster? This isn\u2019t a small step for most people. You have to be willing to examine all of the messages or examples other people gave you that told you to \u201cPlay it safe\u201d, \u201cfit in\u201d, or \u201cDon\u2019t stand out\u201d. You have to go against what you\u2019ve learned - which is to be careful and ignore what you\u2019re passionate about, if it goes against the norm.Once you discover what it is that creates life and excitement within you, or what just feels right on, then you need the courage to do something about it. This is the next step. This means you have to possibly dismantle old beliefs or even old patterns of doing.Then take action steps to put it in place.And then refine all of this. Pursue your passion. Find a way to fit it into your life. And live it courageously, with no apologies to anyone.I\u2019ve written several articles on passion, doing what you love, and removing blocks to passion. Below are some links if you\u2019d want to read further on how to discover and implement your passions. What Makes You Come Alive? Find It and Live It. Removing the Blocks to Passion and Purpose How can I find my passion? Pursuing What You Love to Find Real Happiness In terms of implementing the steps, this is a great book on taking small, manageable steps to accomplish your goals. In this case, creating your life filled with passion and purpose. The Slight Edge: Turning Simple Disciplines into Massive Success And Happiness, by Jeff Olson. It\u2019s a very simple read on how to start making changes now. I hope you do pursue what drives you and what you\u2019re passionate about. It\u2019s the absolute best thing you can do in life - for yourself, as well as the people around you. All the best, -Sumi Connecting individuals to passion & purpose ",

            "answer_text": "I found my passion the moment I had a bottle full of pills in my mouth and I had the choice whether to swallow them or not.  I had carefully researched what would do the trick. But I was worried if I swallowed the pills then the insurance companies wouldn't pay my kids $4 million in life insurance.  They have a funny thing about being judgmental on suicide. Suicide is a horrible thing for kids.  I know this because my wife's mother killed herself. Sometimes I hear Claudia crying in her sleep. It's either because she's married to me or it's because of her mother. Sometimes when I wake her I think she's about to confess that it's both.  I didn't mean for that first sentence to sound dramatic. But before you can find passion, you have to live. You have to say, I WANT to live.  Life is very hard. We're born and a moment later, the connection to all of our happiness that we've ever experienced in the womb is cut by scissors. And then we are slapped hard by the doctor.  Wake up!  We're hit and slapped and burned by cigarettes all over our bodies over and over again until the day we die.  So there's got to be a reason we put up with all this punishment.  The first time I kissed a woman, I couldn't believe it. My lips touched the top of her lips, then the bottom of her pout. Then I found her, then I found me, and under a torn and desperate moon, I found a single moment of pleasure.  It was wonderful. But I wondered, is this where the passion is?  Because there are many of these moments, both good and bad, where inspiration might strike us.  But at some point, they all meld together. And 10 years out I look back and I say, \"that seems like yesterday\". The days are bolted together by a stapler called \"routine\".  What happened to those moments: my mom screaming my name though the neighborhood, my friends ignoring the parents, we were all on two or three piles of rocks on construction sites we were strictly forbidden from playing near.  We were throwing rocks at each other. Because one side was Saturn and the other side was Jupiter and they were at war. Occasionally one of us would time travel and teleport to the other side. And the rock throwing would go in a different direction. There's no north and south in space. And we were in space, with laughter and fun and energy teleporting us back and forth, rocks were our weapons of mass destruction, laughter was our reasons for being, for ignoring the screaming intensity by which one day tediously turns into the next.  \"I hit him!\"  Einstein found his passion because he wondered what a man traveling the speed of light on a spaceship if he looked out the window and saw a man standing still.  DaVinci found his passion drawing machines with wings that flapped like birds - the first illustrations of what 500 years later became planes. Just doodles. Thousands of them.  Charles Darwin found his passion playing with rocks halfway around the world. He played with them, he kicked them around, he drew pictures of the tree of life around those rocks, for EIGHT YEARS, before returning to the land of adults where he accomplished his life's work while all of the adults jeered in his path.  Mozart found his passion when he finally escaped the adulthood of a steady job in Salzburg, for the virility of Vienna where commanding operas and orchestras and singers and actors he grated Don Giovanni, the opera that changed every piece of music that ever came after that.  Marie Curie found her passion, like so many of us, by again playing with rocks. Why did some rocks seem to be like the sun, their own source of light when all else around them was pitch black dark.  Mick Jagger had no musical talent at all but would collect blues records from America and he and his childhood friend Keith Richards would lie around listening to them.  When his parents sent him off to study at the London School of Economics, he was still listening to those records and doodling the notes rather than paying attention to supply versus demand.  Mary Shelley wondered what it would be like if a machine had intelligence. She called her machine Frankenstein and made up stories about how people would treat such a hybrid human/machine.  Ada Lovelace wondered what it would be like to tell a machine what to do. Could such a machine ever exist?  Steve Jobs loved calligraphy and using electronics to scam the phone system.  Nobody discovered their passion as an adult. The child that still lives and breathes and is hidden inside all of us knows the secret of our passion.  Will this child tell us. Can we tease it to give us a clue? Will the child lead us on the right path or maybe play with us and show us the wrong directions first.  It doesn't matter. It's by following the child inside of us that we get closer to the treasure buried at the bottom of an infinitely deep ocean.  The ocean that is built from our responsibilities, our mortgages, our bosses, our schools, our governments, everything that puts a roadblock in between us and competence, us and our friends, us and our freedom.  I try to be a child. And when adulthood gets in the way, I cry. I get scared. I want the childhood back.  It's not easy. Because the world wants you to \"act your age\". So it becomes practice. It becomes exercise.  But here are ten ways I still try to be a child every day. And every day I find my passion. And every day I know I have to repeat these tricks to find that child inside of me:  - PLAY Every day I have to do something for no other reason at all than that it's fun. If I don't do it, the no fun.  What can you do that's fun? Play a game with someone else. Learn a magic trick. Sing.  When people want me to meet at their office I suggest the local ping pong establishment instead. It's through Play that we get to know each other. That  the children we left behind get to meet and together destroy the universe.  - FREE  Nobody paid Einstein to daydream about two people staring at each other, with one going through space as fast as he could.  In fact, he was a clerk in a patent office and could've stayed that way forever.  Nobody paid Ada Lovelace to imagine a world of computers 12o years before one existed. She was supposed to just be a stay-at-home Countess and enjoy her luxuries.  Every day I know I have to pay the bills to live. But I also have to do something totally free in order not to die.  The world of money is a tiny subset of the world of imagination.  - WHY? Why did the micro-cultures on one island look ever so slightly different than the micro-cultures that lived on the next? Darwin wondered.  Why did uranium give off light? Marie Curie wondered. She wondered about it until it killed her.  Why did Opera make Mozart tingle despite the acclaim he was receiving from the blander concertos popular at the time.  Why do children ask why and when you answer they ask why again, and then again.  When you take a subway in NYC it says \"mind the gap\".  It's in the gaps of adults talking that you have to catch yourself and ask \"Why?\"  \"We just got divorced and then I moved to NYC,\" says one man to the other. \"Why?\" is what I always wonder. Why did you get divorced. Why did you pick NYC?  It's none of my business. But a kid doesn't care. A kid asks Why? The Whys add up. The Whys add up on the search for passion.  - FRIENDSHIPS A friend of mine is working on a TV show. I'm going to meet him later today to see how it's going.  To be honest, I want to write an episode for his TV show. Just for the fun of it. I have ideas for stories. It was my list of ten ideas each day this week.  It was fun. But most of all, I want to hear all the things he's learning by doing his TV show. And then I want to ask him about my own creative challenges.  Friendships challenge each other. First we throw rocks at each other. But those rocks ignite the imagination of Jupiter and Saturn and time travel.  Look at all of the arts and sciences: Steve Jobs started as friends with Steve Wozniak long before they made a dime.  Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.  Jackson Pollack and Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein and later Andy Warhol. The friendships that pushed each other to the next level. That pushed each other to compete and to play and to battle and to create.  To create! - INTERESTS Pierre and Marie Curie simply wanted to find out why a rock would glow. And then they fell in love and became adults.  Benjamin Franklin flew a kite to discover electricity.  Galileo was interested in finding out what would happen if a boulder and a feather flew off a tall building at the same time and then discovered the most useful scientific theories of all time.  - HOPES AND DREAMS When I was a little kid I had a notebook. It will filled with \"David likes Lorie because I saw him look at her.\" and \"Joanne likes Bobby because she laughed at his joke.\"  I wrote every day. I wrote a play about a moon that was a live. I wrote a story about Presidents. I wanted to write. I had dreams.  But dreams and mortgages have a hard time staying in the same head. It's ok to be worried about the mortgage. But don't forget to have a little bit of hope. And to see what happens if you act on that daydream, even if just a second.  - DRAWINGS AND DRUMS I asked for a drumset as a kid. But I never used it. But I did draw. I doodled all the time. I drew every day.  Adults say, \"I can't draw.\"  Of course you can! Here's a crayon. Go! I bought a box of crayons (16 colors) the other day.  I just doodled. I colored things in. Some of the colors went outside the lines.  Just practice staying kid-like. Draw a face. I drew my wife. It looked nothing like her. So I turned her into a monster. It still looked nothing like her.  So I ripped up the drawing and started again. Like a kid.  - MOVEMENT When I was a kid I'd get home and jump on the bike (no helmet) and drove everywhere I could. I'd cross the highway! Hopefully my parents never saw me.  I ran up and down the street. We played football on the cement, throwing each other down.  Movement gets every neuron creating. Gets the body healthy. Gets the emotions roaring as you touch and tackle and daydream and breathe in the air with the sun burnt from the day about to die into a sunset.  - CONFUSION When I first moved to New York and I had my very first vacation, I had no money to go anywhere. I was stuck in the city. So I would walk around.  I wandered into areas I had never been before. I was confused where I was. I was confused why other people were out at 10 in the morning. Why weren't they at their jobs?  I wandered from confusion to confusion. Eventually, I started a project, \"3am\" trying to figure out why people were out at 3 in the morning on a Wednesday night. I was confused and wanted to know.  When I do a podcast and someone gives the stock answer they give in every other answer, I get confused. \"But didn't you cry when that company failed?\" I want to know. What did you do?  - SOCIAL INCOMPETENCE I try to learn how to small talk. But I'm not good at it. This is not a bad or good thing. I want to get better.  But sometimes at a party with everyone laughing and having gun I feel alone and isolated.  I try to figure my way out of that feeling of isolation. How can I have fun also?  --- All of these things brings me back to those moments, both good and bad, when I was a kid.  I practice being a kid. A kid laughs 300 times. An adult, on average...five.  Sometimes I can go a week without laughing. Responsibilties, fear, loneliness, anxiety, regret, can weigh me down.  I didn't have those as a kid. I try to laugh. I try to find things that make me align.  As an adult you have to practice being a kid, letting that child peek out again. He or she wants to come out and play and see the world again. What's changed?  The child wants to know! But guess what?  The adults know.  I have experience now. I've had the pills in the mouth. I've been divorced and lost two houses and lost a family.  I've lost my money and been scared and lost a business and had people hate me and try to ruin me.  I've had people I've loved betray me and reject me.  I've had successes that came from hard work and from 100 hour work weeks I thought I would never survive but I learned persistence and I learned how to make it work.  And I learned how to succeed and I learned how to survive failure. Some of the time.  Experience mixed with childhood is a roller coaster. Is a playground. You swing as high as possible and experience knows you will come down safe.  There's no one answer how to find your passion.  But every day, give the child inside of you some exercise using the 10 ideas above.  Mix that child with the experience you've learned over the years of fire and ice.  You'll find your passion. Your passion will find you.  And it's there, in that kiss of passion and you, in that kiss of your inner child and your outer adult, that you will find it.  In the middle its there, torn asunder but ready to be put together and to come out and play. ",

            "answer_text": "Too many of us believe in a magical being called \u2018passion\u2019. \u201cIf only I could find my passion\u201d, we cry. \u201cFinding my passion would make me happy\u201d.   Well, passion is real, and very powerful. But almost everything people believe about finding it is wrong. Rule 1: Passion comes from success All of our emotions exist for good reason. We feel hunger to ensure we don\u2019t starve. We feel full to ensure we don\u2019t burst. And we feel passion to ensure we concentrate our efforts on things that reward us the most. Imagine you start a dance class. You find it easy. You realise you\u2019re getting better than others, and fast. That rising excitement you feel is your passion, and that passion makes you come back for more, improving your skills, and compounding your strengths.  The enemy of passion is frustration. If you constantly struggle with something, you\u2019ll never become passionate about it. You learn to avoid it entirely, guaranteeing you never improve.  Most people get this backwards. They think we discover our passion, and that makes us good at something. It\u2019s actually finding that you\u2019re good which comes first. Passion comes from success. Rule 2: Childhood is where passion goes to die In theory childhood provides a great opportunity to try a bit of everything, find your talents, and with them, your passions. But think for a moment how badly the system is stacked against you. Say school lets you try 20 subjects, ranking you against thousands of other children. Those aren\u2019t good odds. Most kids are, by definition, around average. And it doesn\u2019t matter how much we improve education, because people need to feel exceptional to feel passionate, and improving education simply moves up the average.   Say you\u2019re one of the lucky ones, and you\u2019re top of your junior math class. The education system will keep rising your difficulty until you find a level \u2013 like college \u2013 where you\u2019re not exceptional anymore. Even if you actually are objectively pretty great, once you feel merely average, you\u2019ll find your passion slipping. And that\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky. What if your passion was for art? From an early age that passion is compromised by its social consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a living from painting\u201d say your parents. \u201cYour cousin is doing so well from engineering. Why can\u2019t you be more like him?\u201d And so you put your passions to one side, and let them wither. In a population of billions, it\u2019s obvious that not everyone can be unusually great at a handful of academic subjects. What if your true skills are in speechwriting, or creative dance, or making YouTube commentaries of videogames? None of those things are even on the syllabus. And so most people grow up without much passion for anything. Rule 3: Passion can be created It may help to know that the most successful people in life generally didn\u2019t pick their passion off a shelf.   In fact, many of the world\u2019s most successful people dropped out of education entirely. Not because they were stupid \u2013 but because they found other areas where they were more skilled that education did not recognise. They created their own passions. Only a tiny fraction of people can expect to excel in the narrow subjects that childhood primes us for. And competition in that space is basically \u2018everybody in the world who went to school\u2019, which doesn\u2019t help our chances. But if you look outside of that space, you\u2019ll find less competition, and more options. And this is how you tip the odds of finding a passion in your favour. Option 1: Create something When you create something new, you\u2019re inventing something to be passionate about. You might design novelty cushions, or write Batman stories, or start a Twitter account dedicated to fact-checking politicians.  New things are relatively uncontested. By creating something new, you\u2019ve made your odds of becoming exceptional far, far higher. Now it\u2019s important to note that this doesn\u2019t sidestep Rule #1: passion comes from success. So if your new Twitter account only has 5 followers after a year, you probably won\u2019t be too passionate about it. If you had 5 million, you\u2019d have quit your job. You must find success to fuel your passion.   But at least you\u2019ve drastically improved your odds, because your competition is so limited. Only a handful of people will even dare to try something new. And you can be one of them, just by starting. You see this pattern throughout history\u2019s greats. A student called Mark was never going to be the world\u2019s greatest programmer. But he started building cool websites, and he found he was unusually good at this because even better programmers rarely dared to try. It just so happens one of his little experiments became Facebook. Option 2: Lead a new trend The older and more established an area is, the harder it will be to compete in. Millions have got there before you, and the lower your odds of standing out, the lower your odds of being passionate. But there\u2019s always a new frontier being born, a place where everyone else is hopelessly incapable, and even modest skills can be impressive.   Say you were a teenager who started making YouTube videos, back in 2005. You grow a modest following, and your growing success excites you. By the time the \u2018grown up\u2019 world had realised YouTube was Kind-Of-A-Big-Deal with 4 billion views every single day, you\u2019ve become a passionate master of an invaluable new craft. That isn\u2019t fantasy. There are mountains of hugely successful YouTubers, and most started in the same way: before everybody else. It\u2019s the same for the first bloggers, rappers, and videogame designers. If you can find something new that\u2019s growing fast, and get skilled at it early, you\u2019ll find it disproportionately easy to excel because of the lack of competition. And that\u2019s your new passion right there. Option 3: Fuse mediocrity One limitation of education is it\u2019s designed to narrow your skills. Education generally finds your One Best Thing, and pushes that thing as far as you can stand it:   The problem is most of us, by definition, can\u2019t be the best in any one area. But we can be exceptional in our combinations. Say you\u2019re an average artist, with a decent sense of humour. You won\u2019t have much hope with an art degree, and you can\u2019t study \u2018humour\u2019 as a subject. But you could be an awesome cartoonist. Or take an average business student, with some programming ability, and decent sales skills. That person is surprisingly well suited to become the boss of others who were better than them in any one of those areas. The most successful people are almost never defined by a single skill. They are a fusion of skills, often not even exceptional skills, but they\u2019ve made their fusion exceptional. Steve Jobs was not the world\u2019s greatest engineer, salesperson, designer or businessman. But he was uniquely good enough at all of these things, and wove them together into something far greater. This is the final route you have to finding your passion: combine skills into something more valuable. Remember, passion comes from success. If a new combination gets you better results, that could be your passion right there. Why passion matters Passion is attractive. As passion comes from believing you\u2019re unusually good at something, being passionate is a very sincere way of saying, \u201cby the way, I\u2019m awesome\u201d.   Passion will persuade people to follow you. It will persuade people to believe in you. But most importantly, passion will persuade yourself. Passion is an emotion specifically intended to make you go crazy and work your ass off at something because your brain believes it could rock your world. That, like love, is a feeling worth fighting for. And like love, what we\u2019re passionate about is too important to leave to the mercy of fate. If you haven\u2019t found your passion yet, create new things, lead new trends, and fuse new combinations. But don\u2019t ever stop looking. More from me   .  Follow on Facebook   .

            "answer_text": "Well, there is no such formula...but in fact you can listen to yourself before listening to any of those things told by people around you about you being passionate for something or the other. I will give you a practical way of finding this out.Sit for a while, take 4-5 deep breaths...then when you are peacefully relaxed,close your eyes...and ask the following question from within you and to you.. : If, FOR YOU,there was no hunger and responsibility in the world and you did not have to work or earn money to fill your belly...and then if you were to choose one thing out of all the activities happening in this world, considering the condition that-\"no matter what you choose, you will be heavily and equally paid for it...\", then what would be the first and foremost thing that you would choose..????You can scroll through all the things coming in your mind, discard those which you feel unworthy and then choose something that you are only and only INTERESTED IN from the thoughts you have had..!!..THAT IS YOUR PASSION..!!..Well, it may sound weird or even absurd...but then it works..!!We are never able to find the passion of our life because we are surrounded with lots of boundaries that put us in a closed state of mind and which only allow the mind to concentrate on those things. We become extremely busy and involved in fulfilling responsibilities, earning money, and doing all other chores that we are made to do just because we need to follow the pattern of living of a normal human being..!!Well,lost..??Let's take an example....A guys loves wildlife, and whenever he visits such a place, he loves capturing them. But then, back at his home, he is a software engineer, sits for a 9-6 job in his office chair, comes home, takes dinner and by end of year waits for a hike or a promotion..!!..Well, of course he can become passionate while doing his work so that he gives outstanding results to get his promotions. But then HIS OWN PASSION is no where around here.Had he been a wildlife photographer for real, he would smile at the end of the day while browsing through his pictures; would become more curious about more wildlife areas in the world; would have a deep sound satisfying sleep every night he comes from the forest, and soo on..!! :)So to find your passion, you need to to keep your circle of influence away from you and then look thought the PURE-YOU...!!.Have a nice time finding your passion and working upon it happily and contented :)Keep Smiling :) ",

            "answer_text": "In short: Seek. Try. Repeat as needed Elaborating on this\u2026 Learn as much as you can about yourself, including your personality, interests and character. The aim in this step is to discover (I) what are your values (ii) what is your personality (iii) what are your talents. Read self help books, psychology books, philosophy books, see a career counsellor etc\u2026 It's very important to understand what you enjoy and why you enjoy certain activities, and why you are drawn to do certain things. For example, you might enjoy music because it reminds you of a very pleasant memory during childhood. This is a good reason to pursue music in some form. Alternatively, you might want to be a doctor because of a subconscious sense of inferiority and needing to prove your self worth. This would not be a healthy reason to become a doctor because you might realise what you are doing later in life when it's too late to go back and pursue your true interests. What you learn in this step is important for the following steps and for you to understand whether certain activities that you might want to pursue as your passion may or may not be suitable (because they might not suit your personality / character, or you might not be pursuing them for the right reasons).Make a list of your talents, and then find activities that include your talents. The reason is that, usually, passion is not something we are born to do - it's something we learn to love. (proof: If you were born to do it, you wouldn't ask this question). So, try as many activities as you can. E.g. If your talent is playing guitar, try playing in a band, playing solo, playing small gigs in bars, playing on your own, recording some songs, upload them to YouTube etc\u2026 Once you've done that, now you can try honing in to one or two activities. Say you like playing in a band, trying doing it and sustaining it for at least a few months. Do you eventually get super sick of it? If so, let it go and move on to the next talent/list of activities.Find the activities that you \u201cjust want to do\u201d even if the world is ending. I've come to this realisation quite recently, for obvious reasons. I'll give my own life example because I have made so many mistakes and wasted so much time, I hope you can learn from my mistakes. I am a nurse presently, but I enjoy physics and I enjoy teaching. But I've never truly pursued either with full steam. I've felt teaching and nursing are \u201ctoo simple\u201d and that I'm \u201cnot doing anything big\u201d. So I now want to get into policy analysis, thinking I'll do something big. But after many years of painful self reflection, I've come to realise that I might just want to \u201caccomplish something big\u201d to compensate for my depression, and to compensate for the thoughts of worthlessness. With the bushfires and the coronavirus, with the world feeling like it's falling apart, I'm slowly starting to realise that I don't need to be anything big, i just want to curl up with a book on general relativity and my family and that's it. Simple dreams, yes, but I enjoy it, for no real reason except I enjoy it. THAT is what you need to look for. Proof: Jobs, Wosniak, Gates, Musk, Bezos, Einstein, Feynman, Dirac etc\u2026what is the most fundamental thing that they all have in common? They loved what they do/did.Develop your focus and discipline to get through the boring days. No matter how passionate you are, there will always be those boring, grinding days. The question is: are you able to get through those days? I used to think that people who are obsessed with something or \u201ctruly passionate\u201d won't ever have those days. I think I was wrong. I think it's more that they have such strong character and discipline that they ram through such obstacles as if they weren't even there. They are ultra focused on their goals that they don't care how laborious the work is for a day or a few weeks or months; they just get it done. You will need this step to do the next.Set short term and long term goals, and undertake responsibility: I think a large part of a passion is accomplishing something, and being competent enough that you can bear responsibility. Say you are have discovered your talent is caring for people, so you get in to nursing. So you get into it, work hard and diligently, gain experience and obtain promotions, and eventually become so respected by your peers and bosses that you are given lots of responsibility - THAT'S the moment you start going to work thinking \u201cGosh I love what I do\u201d.And here are a few extra tips while you are still searching for your passion: Stop making plans. My big mistake in life is thinking I can plan my life. That\u2019s wrong. Set an overall outline with goals along the way, but not a firm year-by-year plan. Because life has an interesting way of changing things up. Also, living in this frame of mind where you can \u201cplan to have a passion\u201d is plain ridiculous. We don't know why exactly we like the things we do, so stop planning to like something.Try. It is imperative that you actually try to do whatever you want to do. And give it a good solid try, not just a few seconds.Your passion may not be your job, and that's okay. In this world, it is very difficult to have a passion that is also a job. We hear alot about the success stories, but not the many many unsuccessful stories. But that's okay. Find a job to feed your stomach, and find your passion to feed your soul.Avoid regret, not mistakes. Another failing of mine; I was so afraid of making mistakes, that I made regrets. And these have stuck with me \ud83d\ude14. I wish you do not do this. Make mistakes. Fail. And move on. Basically when you are faced with a decision, think, \u201cwill I regret not doing this\u201d.I wish you all the best, and I hope you have a great life devoid of fear and regret. ",

            "answer_text": "Read the book \u201cSo good they cant ignore you\u201d by Cal Newport, or blinkist has a 24hr free trial(just 24hrs? Really blinkist?) Where they give you only highlights of the book. The thing is, your passions can change, and they can be great but not lead to any job you get up in the morning every day excited to go to(I like my job personally and you\u2019ll never have 100% days like that), but if you solely focus on passion you may end up going from job to job, searching, instead of focusing on rare and valuable skills. Master a valuable skill and you may find passion for it down the road. Or worst case scenario, that skill mastery can lead to allowing your passion to be a great little hobby on the side. By the way, mastering skills does not mean you must pursue a regular job, you can certainly use that for self-employment, but if you don\u2019t develope useful and important skills, you won\u2019t be in business very long. I\u2019m 23 man, I enjoy the life I\u2019ve created so far regardless of the human faults that naturally exist. I used to be searching for my passion all the time, and what this led me to was very hot, and very cold approaches to the same topic in only a matter of months. Meaning I\u2019d be super into something, only to drop it for the next shiny object months later. Passion won\u2019t necessarily lead to financial success(it could though), but passion can lead to fun, community, friendship, challenge, and other healthy aspects of life. Passion misused can easily lead to anger, frustration, violence, and most likely, social media arguments. Finding your passion, in my opinion leads to the same clich\u00e9 response garnered when asking \u201cHow can I find the love of my life?\u201d It will find you when you aren\u2019t searching for it. So focus on what you can control in the mean time, which can be learning more about yourself, building discipline, developing valuable skills, learning how to feel and understand emotions, while also not allowing them to control you, ie. a level of detachment from emotions. You can learn to take care of yourself, and learn to know your needs. You can stop externalizing things like support, happiness, comfort, confidence. And learn to build those things from within. ",

            "answer_text": "Spend some alone time every day, even 20 minutes before bed, and think about what has interested you in that day and in the recent past.Some may call it \"meditating\", thinking, etc., but I think it is mostly about getting to know yourself. I have always regarded \"thinking/meditating\" as a process of \"reading/analyzing your mind\", which in turn leads to discovering your true passion. I am also in my 20's and I have always thought that our generation never really appreciates time spent alone. Rather, most of us decide to spend time posting nonsense on SNS and spend hours every day, reading through shallow posts other peers have written. Some of my own passion rooted from my love of cars. Back in my freshman year in college, with an intended major in business, I was pressured to join a business fraternity just because it increased my chances of getting in the business school. Even then, I was wise enough to know that the fundamental concepts of \"business\" and \"fraternity\" don't go together and I especially didn't want to pretend like I'm a \"bro\" to some superficial and opportunistic brats. So instead, I dropped my chances of getting into the business school, declared economics as my major (bleh!), and spent my spare time pursuing my personal interests.I started by reading posts on a small forum and doing some DIY modifications on my Camaro that I got for my 19th birthday.  I took my car apart in my apartment's garage, installed a new set of speakers, and changed the mufflers as well. While these tasks seem very simple, I learned a lot and my curious brain was feeding quite well. Then I began to read news and magazines about car trends, and spent a lot of time thinking about near-future trends.Then, I began to wonder about the automobile software, and thought that it has a lot of room for improvement. Thus, I got into studying computer programming and software development and it was a lot of fun!Nowadays, I am combining my interests (connecting the dots, I would say) and have begun studying about the Business-IT hybrid industry (aka Big Data, Business Intelligence Analytic, etc.). After amassing all that knowledge from studying near-future trends, economics, and computer science, my level of understanding of seemingly new concepts in the BI field has been progressively faster, and it would take me just two days to read over an intermediate-level reading (400+ pages) on BI, without leaving out big concepts (skipping some minor ones though). More likely than not, you are very close from finding your passion. Don't be afraid to discover and admit your fields of interest and explore them in depth. Don't be discouraged by all the achievements that peers around you are making, because many times, such emotions will blind you from discovering your true passion.Most importantly, don't be a follower of others and be a conqueror of self. In my opinion, all it takes is 20 minutes a day to think over your days. Your true passion is not found overnight, but is realized through series of discoveries of small interests. \"Life is a Marathon, not a sprint\".It's like you can't beat a train on a rail that constantly goes 40 mph, by driving 95 mph in an automobile on a road with stop signs every 10 blocks or so. You may feel good about yourself while driving that fast, but in time, the train will beat you by far. Life is not a race but a journey. 20 minutes a day! ",

            "answer_text": "The best advice I can give to you is that you will never find your passion just by sitting around. A lot of people just wait for their passion to come to them, but you need to search for it by taking action. Here's my story: I came into college as an astronautical engineering major. I have always loved science and one night when I was in the southern coast of France in a small town called La Ciotat, I saw the milky way for the first time. This moment inspired me to do something space related which in turn led me to write the essay that got into my dream college in Los Angeles. However, after one semester I realized how tough the competition was in my field and that many career paths led to military and defense. Help create technology that the military could use to harm others? Hells no. So that only really meant one option at the time: NASA. I asked my professor who had previous worked at NASA what I should do to increase my chances to work there, and he told me that becoming an Industrial Engineer might be the best solution.  After I switched majors to Industrial Engineering, I discovered that I found it extremely boring. The curriculum at my school made the major appear as a glorified supply chain worker. I wanted to change the world, and doing what I was learning in class did not seem to be my calling. It was at that time I started reading. I read a lot of things that inspired me to do something big and one of these readings happened to be TechCrunch. One day I noticed an ad on the TechCrunch website asking for volunteers for their first conference called TechCrunch Disrupt. I said, \"why not?\" because it seems pretty interesting since I had never been to any kind of conference before. It was at this conference where I can say I found my passion. It was here I met brilliant people from all over America and it was at this conference I first witnessed a hackathon. It was intense, it was crazy, and it was eye opening. I always had ideas, but to see people make something out of nothing in just 24 hours showed me that through hard work and perseverance, anything is possible. These hackers became my heroes. Every year since freshman year I have tried so hard to become a programmer and create products for a career. Every year though, my search always led me to something else. My freshman year I was hired to Avis Budget Group as an IT/Marketing intern because my interviewer and I talked about the future of HTML5 and flash for 45 minutes. My sophomore year I was hired as an IT intern at Johnson & Johnson because my interviewer and I talked about how awesome Google I/O was which I had the honor to attend at the time. My junior year I worked at KPMG as a management consultant (because I burned out a little on computer science at the time and noticed this when one night I drunkenly said to a girl, \"I can't talk to you because you don't know HTML\"). At the beginning of this year I got the opportunity to work at SpaceX, but I soon realized that my passion was no longer in space. But during all this time, during all these detours, I always continued to code. I took part in Linkedin's Intern Hackathon, I built websites on my own, I read thousand page books on different coding languages in days. I even threw my own hackathon at USC to share my passion with future Trojans. I would have never guessed that I would be hired to Salesforce.com at the end of my college career to build prototypes coming out with an Industrial Engineering degree. In fact, none of my friends did. I never sat around. I stayed awake countless nights trying to figure out how PHP worked instead of studying for my quizes for class, I drove 5 hours straight just so I could stay awake for 24 more hours to code with people I've never met before, but most importantly I never stopped being passionate. It takes some effort to find your passion, but when you do, pursuing it feels easy as hell. ",

            "answer_text": "This is going to be a long answer as it comes from someone who is pursuing his \u2018Passion\u2019. And it might make you feel uncomfortable and it might shake your belief in various theories like the one Oliver Emberton has nicely described. I also know that you are just 24 and patience isn\u2019t your greatest virtue, but then, this is important and you know that. So stay with me.  First of all let us ask ourselves this basic question - What is Passion? Passion is something that we really want to do, no matter what others say, no matter what we get out of it, and no matter what the results are. I mention these three things because let's say if your parents or your lover are not in agreement with your passion, you cannot give up on your passion. Similarly, passion is something that is not result oriented, though success is (this is where I disagree with Oliver Emberton that passion needs success). So many great people we know today who were not considered that \u2018great\u2019 in their era. They did not make much of money or get many rewards. But still they have made so much contribution that none of us can ignore.  So, we come to the first rule to find your passion - you will have to forget the results. You have to do it no matter what others say, no matter what you get out of it.  Now that we know what passion is, let us move forward and see how we can discover our passion. Or we can first go through a few questions that are important in this context. I am sure you will also have one (or more) of them in mind. What if I do not love anything enough to call it passion? I have interest in two-three areas. How do I figure out which one is my passion? I do not love my job. Can I quit it by saying \u2013 this is the call of my passion? Is it bad if I do not believe in passion? Why do I have to find my passion?  However irrelevant it might appear, but the last question is really very important.  WHY? Possible explanations are: Because you will die without passion: WRONGBecause happiness depends on passion: WRONGBecause the term \u2018Passion\u2019 has become so fashionable in the recent times that everybody just wants to have it: DAMN! YOU ARE A GENIUS Yes, I do believe that \u2018Passion\u2019 is one of the most overrated things in today\u2019s world. In today\u2019s world where we live \u2013 it is more connected than it had ever been before, we are awed by the success of others. We hear so many stories of success and passion that we also want to do something extraordinary to make our life worth.  In this situation we feel obliged (and pressurized) to find our passion. Fortunately, the earlier generations were quite ignorant about this idea.  That is my theory. And similarly, you will have many more theories. But if any theory was accurate, wouldn\u2019t all of us be chasing our passion?  The reason why most of us never find our passion is that we keep thinking about success all the time. But think about this:  Is success really that important? It might disappoint you my dear friend, but the answer is no. And the answer lies in the fact that most of us have this craving of discovering our passion in twenties only. Ever wondered why? Not because we are young and brave but because we think that success is the only thing that can give us happiness. Which of course is not true.  Long story short, if you want to find your passion, think of life as an opportunity to make a contribution not a ladder to climb the success. The point is \u2013 don\u2019t think about \u2018Passion\u2019 but think about your life. And if you REALLY REALLY want to do something \u2018big\u2019 in life, let me make things easy for you with following points: \u00b7       The biggest mistake that we make while discovering our passion is that we seek the answer it outside, when the answer lies within. We all know what we want to do but we are just afraid to pursue it. So what we do we start chasing success, so that we can convince ourselves and everyone that we have enough and we can really do whatever we want. Think about it \u2013 what would you do if you have got all the money  and success in the world. Would you still do the same job? In most cases, the answer is \u2018No\u2019. We need to conquer our own fears and start believing ourselves that we can do it. Then only we will be the right path.\u00b7       There is a big confusion in \u2013 becoming something and doing something. \u2018Becoming something\u2019 is what depends on circumstances, market, and other external factors. \u2018Doing something\u2019 is totally up to you. I have seen so many people who want to become politicians so that they can serve people. But if they really wanted to serve people, they could have started with it in the first place. They don\u2019t need to become something for that. This applies for every profession. So, passion is (and should be) about doing not becoming. Let\u2019s say if you love playing Cricket. Playing Cricket for your country can be your dream, but that cannot be a passion. Make sure that you enjoy your work so much that the results do not affect your love for that.\u00b7       Have you ever seen a person who is pursuing his or her passion by following a tried and tested theory and eliminating the options which are not working out. No right? There cannot be. The essential ingredient to find your passion is \u2013 to struggle. This might sound crazy, but if you do a quick research, you will find that no sober person in his/her comfort zone ever found their passion. You cannot give up on your passion. If you are going for it with a back up option, there are 100 percent chances that you will go back to your back up plan. So, ask yourself what is your passion? What do you want to do more than anything else in the world? And then just go for it. Don\u2019t stop, ever.\u00b7       Now, the most important point. Many people might become successful and fool themselves by saying that they are pursuing they have found their passion. But you know that is not true. In fact success is the biggest hurdle to discover your passion. When we get enough money and fame, we often forget this important question \u2013 is this really we want to do?  And as I said, your heart already knows the answer. It always does\u2026 Be honest with yourself and you will find it. Because if it cannot, no one or nothing else can\u2026 Before I say good bye, let me write something for you. I hope you will keep it with you.  Don\u2019t ask me, don\u2019t ask others,Your heart already knows the answer. There will be fear, the path will never be clear, but... Your heart already knows the answer.Fall, fail, and fly, don\u2019t be afraidYour heart already knows the answer.Life is short, short enough to not do everything,But your heart already knows the answer.  Coming to my journey, yes, I have identified my passion. I love writing and this is what I want to do, no matter what I get in return, what others say about it or what the results turn out to be. Because, once (and just once) I talked honestly with myself \u2013 and my heart knew the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Question this to yourself ?  WHAT IS YOUR TENNIS BALL? This question, derived from a terrific commencement speech given at MIT last year by Dropbox founder Drew Houston, is a good place to start because it cuts to the chase. As Houston explained, \"The most successful people are obsessed with solving an important problem, something that matters to them. They remind me of a dog chasing a tennis ball.\" To increase your chances of happiness and success, Houston said, you must \"find your tennis ball\u2014the thing that pulls you.\" Sometimes, we may not be aware of what truly engages us until we examine our own activities and behaviors from a detached, inquisitive perspective. \"You almost have to ask yourself, What do I find myself doing?,\" explains the author and happiness guru Gretchen Rubin. \"What you spend time doing can also tell you what you should do. Because sometimes the things we do without thinking really are things we naturally enjoy or are good at.\" So pay attention to what pulls you. For instance, \"when you\u2019re in a bookstore,\" says author Carol Adrienne, \"what section of the store are you drawn to?\" That will not only tell you what books you love\u2014it may point to where your tennis ball can be found. For a slightly different spin on the \"tennis ball\" concept, ask: What am I doing when I feel most beautiful? This is about identifying not only what draws you in, but also what makes you shine. Jacqueline Novogratz, founder of The Acumen Fund, told me that in her globe-spanning travels she often asks people this question, sometimes in unlikely settings. She once posed the question to women living in a slum in Bombay. At first, \"one woman said, \u2018There\u2019s nothing in our lives that\u2019s beautiful,\u2019\" Novogratz says. \"But eventually, a woman who worked as a gardener said, \u2018All winter long I slog and slog, but when those flowers push through the ground, I feel beautiful.\u2019\" Novogratz says it\u2019s important to think about \"that time and place where you feel most alive\u2014whether it\u2019s when you\u2019re solving a problem, creating, connecting with someone, traveling.\" Whatever it is, Novogratz says, identify it\u2014and if possible, find a way to do more of it. (A different version of Novogratz\u2019s \"beautiful\" question is suggested by consultant Keith Yamashita of SY Partners: \"Who have you been, when you\u2019ve been at your best?\") What is something you believe that almost nobody agrees with you on? This question, which PayPal co-founder and Thiel Foundation chief Peter Thiel has shared publicly in interviews and lectures, is designed to do two things: help you figure out what you care about and also determine whether it\u2019s worth pursuing, based on uniqueness. Thiel concedes that it\u2019s a challenging question because it can be tough to find an idea or belief that isn\u2019t shared by many others. \"Originality is deceptively hard,\" he told Pandodaily.  But if you can find a problem or challenge no one else is tackling, you can carve your own niche and create value. \"You don\u2019t want to be interchangeably competing with people,\" Thiel says. Though we\u2019re taught to do what others are doing and try to succeed by out-competing, this, in Thiel\u2019s view, amounts to \"beating your head against the wall\u2014rather than going through the open door that no one is looking at.\" What are your superpowers? The idea behind this question from Yamashita is to \"unpack the combination of personality traits and aptitudes you bring effortlessly to any situation.\" The filmmaker Tiffany Shlain of The Moxie Institute also explores strengths and natural \"superpowers\" in her new web film \"The Science of Character,\" which suggests that if we can identify our inherent character strengths and build on them, we can lead happier, more successful lives. Having trouble listing your powers and strengths? Check out the \"Periodic Table of Character Strengths\" in Shlain\u2019s film, or refer to Gallup executive Tom Rath\u2019s popular \"StrengthsFinder 2.0\" program, with its menu of 34 traits. Once you\u2019ve identified your own strengths, you\u2019ll be in a better position to make the most of what you already have going for you. Sometimes by looking back into the past, says Rubin, you can get a glimpse of who you really are and what you loved doing before others started telling you what you should do. So what did you enjoy doing at age 10? Eric Maisel, a psychotherapist and author, agrees, adding: \"The things we loved as a child are probably still the things we love.\" He suggests drawing up a list of favorite activities and interests from childhood\u2014\"and see what still resonates with you today. And then it\u2019s a process of updating those loves. You may have loved something that doesn\u2019t even exist now, or doesn\u2019t make sense in your life now\u2014but you may be able to find a new version of that.\" What are you willing to try now? One of the best ways to find your purpose and passion is through experimentation. For many people, this is counter-intuitive. Herminia Ibarra, a professor at INSEAD and author of Working Identity: Unconventional Strategies for Reinventing Your Career, points out that there is a tendency to devote extensive time, research, and planning to figuring out the ideal path before taking any action. This may involve poring over self-help books, soliciting advice, and waiting for the epiphany that shows you your \"true self\"\u2014at which point you can strike out confidently in a new direction. We learn who we are\u2014in practice, not in theory\u2014by testing reality. But that\u2019s all wrong, according to Ibarra. \"To launch ourselves anew, we need to get out of our heads,\" she says. \"We need to act.\" That means devising a series of trials and errors: Ibarra advises looking for temporary assignments, outside contracts, advisory work, and moonlighting to get experience or build skills in new industries; executive programs, sabbaticals, and extended vacations also can be valuable in providing opportunities to experiment. She concludes, \"We learn who we are\u2014in practice, not in theory\u2014by testing reality.\" Looking back on your career, 20 or 30 years from now, what do you want to say you\u2019ve accomplished? In an interview, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner said that he often asks prospective employees the above question. \"You\u2019d be amazed how many people I meet who don\u2019t have the answer to the question,\" Weiner said. So here\u2019s your chance to answer it (without the pressure of having Weiner across the table, awaiting your response). Think of this exercise as a less-gloomy version of write-your-own-obit. What would you include on your list of hoped-for achievements? Or, even better than compiling a laundry list, why not figure out\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The key to loving your job is to ask yourself one simple question: \u201cWhat is my biggest strength?\u201d Think about it: so many people are in jobs they hate because they haven\u2019t found that one true passion. They are good at a few things so that\u2019s what they do here and there, but they aren\u2019t sure what that one big thing they want to do forever could be. Here is my message: stop doing shit you hate. Nail down your strengths so you can discover your passion. I have four steps to help you guys figure it out that will hopefully help all the comments and emails I see around \u201chow do I find my strengths?\u201d or \u201chow I do I know what my best job skills are?\u201d There are so many articles that dance around, but I want to give you all four concrete pieces of advice. #1: WHAT ARE MY SKILLS? Take the five to ten people that know you the best. Split them into two categories: people you connect with on a deep level of love, and people who you are close with, but maybe you\u2019re a little different in lifestyle and personality. Then, ask one person from each category to honestly tell you what they think you\u2019re best at, and what they think you\u2019re worst at. \u201cWhat are my skills and abilities, and what are my weaknesses?\u201d I truly believe that collecting market research and creating an atmosphere that allows someone to be honest with you are the two big things here. When someone really loves you, they might not want to be totally honest, because they don\u2019t want to hurt you. But the quickest way to find your strengths is by eliminating weaknesses. #2: WHAT ARE MY STRENGTHS? You can\u2019t take a romantic view on the skills that have made you successful so far in life. For example, you might have been a straight A student even though you have no passion for academics. Or you\u2019re naturally amazing at basketball, but that isn\u2019t what you truly want to pursue. But one way those strengths can come in handy tremendously is by using them as a blueprint to discovering talents you may not have understood before. Maybe you\u2019ve been blinded by the overarching strength itself because you aren\u2019t passionate about it, but list all the things that that skill requires you to do. Don\u2019t take them for granted. There are many things that go into being good at something. Your potential doesn\u2019t end with that one skill. #3: READ EVERYTHING Now, I know this is a very grey world. To find your personal strengths is, well, very personal. But I want to make sure I leave you with real actionable advice. So here is a super specific one for you: go on a vacation. Yeah, seriously. But it\u2019s not a total vacation. During that time, you\u2019re going to go back through every email, letter or note someone wrote you, talking about your accolades or failures. Read all of them. And as you read, ask yourself \u201cWhich of my skills am I consistently praised for?\u201d And on the flipside: what do people continuously say you are bad at? This task could take many many hours. You might be thinking it will take too many hours. But think: you are the one who clicked on this article. It can\u2019t be that much time because it seems like you really want to figure this out, right? In the end, it\u2019s a small amount of time to sacrifice compared to the happiness it will give you for the rest of your life. #4: ASK STRANGERS On social media, make a video or post asking everyone who follows you the very question we have been repeating over and over: \u201cWhat are my personal strengths?\u201d This can be phrased in a number of ways when it comes to people who follow you for your content and comments. I like to ask what I am doing that they like. What have they found helpful? What has my best work been? What is my potential? This is now the widest net you can cast to get the information. Because these are people who have been viewing you from a very specific place, your social media personality, you are able to curate that part of your life as well into the decision of which strength to pursue. After these four steps, you should have the depth of personal information you need to move forward to your new destination. Bring all these thoughts together to find the skill and strength that will benefit you. From there, the options are endless: a new career move? Start a new company? Find a business partner that complements your strengths and work for him? Start a company with him? I\u2019m pumped for you just thinking about the awesome stuff you can do. ",

            "answer_text": "Jeff Bezos was asked how he became so passionate. Most expected a reply long & sour, but Bezos kept it short & sweet: \u201cYou don\u2019t choose your passions. Your passions CHOOSE YOU.\u201d  HOW TO LET YOUR PASSION CHOOSE YOU  I. YOUR DREAM is CALLING YOU . . . PICK UP!  Before he starred in the role as rapper \"Jay-Z,\" became a billionaire and married Beyonc\u00e9, Shawn Carter was just one of the guys in the hood. \u2026 In Brooklyn, Carter was the gangly dude seen around town \"walking down the street eating a $1 slice of pizza.\" Carter\u2014a high school dropout\u2014found himself in the unwanted position of street pharmacist. It was in the midst of petty drug-dealing, however, that Carter\u2019s dream came calling. In an interview with Oprah, Carter recalled: I use to stand outside the bodega, and my mind would be overflowed with these poems . . . ya know. It got to a point where I\u2019d have to rush inside the store to borrow a pen and brown paper bag to scribble on. It was like something was chasing me . . . trying to motivate me to do something more with my life. Eventually Carter answered the call from his dream to such an extent that the passion propelled him to become Jay-Z! Indeed: you don\u2019t choose your passion, your passion chooses you. \u2026  In 1990 Jeff Bezos had a comfortable position at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw & C0. At just 30, Bezos was making well into 6 figures and on his way to a comfortable lifestyle. Yet friends and family were shocked when Bezos randomly quit his secure, well-paying job to start Amazon. And what was Bezos\u2019 response? \u201cYou don\u2019t choose your passions. Your passions choose you!\u201d   II. WHAT EINSTEIN KNEW ABOUT HOW \u201cGENIUS\u201d ties into PASSION When you see the name Albert Einstein, you\u2019re literally seeing the nickname for GENIUS. Notice that listed among the synonyms for genius is one rather \u201cpeculiar\u201d addition.  Think about that for a second. \u2026 Indeed, it borders on unbelievable that the last name of an actual flesh and blood person serves as a nickname for Genius. Listed along with the usual suspects\u2014brilliance, mastermind, etc\u2014all of which are abstract nouns, there\u2019s one name that stands out like Shaquille O'neal in a room of gymnasts.  And so, given that Einstein was genius personified, wouldn\u2019t you suppose he knew a thing or two about uncovering the source of your passion? Here lies the reason Einstein went so far as to have said:  Bingo! Long before the word genius got distorted, it had a far simpler meaning. In fact, the original meaning of genius is Latin: \u201cattendant spirit present from one's birth, innate ability or inclination [aka, passion].\u201d Bingo! According to the ancient Romans, then, each person comes into the world stamped with a genius! In the Vedic tradition, this ancient wisdom is known as one\u2019s dharma (\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e). To put it simply: so far as each man, woman and child is an individual\u2014which simply means UNIQUE\u2014as a consequence each individual has the capacity to do ONE thing in a special way.   III. In CLOSING The Delphic Oracle called Socrates \u201cthe wisest person in Athens.\u201d Socrates in turn justified the crowning by noting:  Take one glance at the definition of passion and its DNA becomes clear:  Passion = Boundless Enthusiasm. Bingo! Apply the Socratic method to the term enthusiasm, and the source from which your passion springs becomes apparent:  Passion/Enthusiasm (\u201cpossessed by a god\u201d) and genius (\u201ctutelary spirit present from one\u2019s birth\u201d). Btw: \u201cgod\u201d and \u201cspirit,\u201d in this sense, means metaphysical\u2014i.e., meta- (\u2018before\u2019) + physical. \u2026 Hence the expression\u2014PREsent (pre + sent) from one\u2019s birth. And so, guess what? All point to the same source:  Bingo! Now you know why ol\u2019 Bezos said the passion chooses you. \u2026 Now you know why ol\u2019 Einstein said everyone has genius potential. \u2026 Let\u2019s again make use of the Socratic Method. What exactly does INDIVIDUALITY mean?  Bingo! By definition: INDIVIDUAL = YOU are distinguished from all others (every other person, place and thing). Now you know why those Ancient Greeks were so darn obsessed with:  Ponder, if you will, this world\u2019s stage was setup billions of years before you finally made your grand appearance. And, what may be even grander than the appearance itself is, well . . . get this: this is the only time in history that you\u2014the INDIVIDUAL expression\u2014will ever exist. \u2026 Ever! What does all this mean, you must wonder? In other words, just as your complete genetic instructions lay in your genes, so too did your passion and genius potential.  In other words: Genius + Passion = INDIVIDUALITY. Even the world\u2019s most famous doctor never to have been awarded a PhD knew Passion speaks in the voice of individuality:  To put it simply: Whatever distinguishes you from others . . . Whether it be you\u2019re naturally funny . . . Or you naturally sing with a voice so lovely even the hummingbirds stop chirping just to hear you perform live in the shower . . . Or you naturally argue so well that folks are convinced \u201cya should\u2019ve been a lawyer\u201d . . . In ever such case: your individuality, which daily seeks expression, is the voice of your PASSION calling out to you! Will you answer the call? What\u2019s your hobby? If money were no object, what would you do for a living? In other words:  In short, whatever makes you, YOU\u2014namely, the expression of your individuality\u2014is the very voice of your passion. \u2026 Why else would you suppose someone like Lady Gaga wears a meat dress to the awards show? Or Michael Jackson donned a single glittery glove on one hand and held Bubbles the Chimp in the other?  Every such attempt to be like another comes at the price of compromising the expression of your own distinct genius . . . Each attempt to ignore being true to yourself comes at the price of ignoring the call from your own passion. \u2026 In short: learn to be indifferent to a world in which you are different!

            "answer_text": "The fact that you asked this question shows that you are interested in finding something to which you wish to commit some of your time. A true passion can be inside you and still be undiscovered. Have you taken the time to think seriously about this topic? Please do so by asking yourself, \"If everything was ideal in my life five or ten years from now, how would I know it? What would be happening?\" Make a list of what an ideal life would look like. Do not judge your answers until you have exhausted the list. Keep pushing the question. Some of your answers may appear minor such as, \"I would have ice cream whenever I wanted it.\" Do not worry about that. At this stage no answer large or small is right or wrong. Just keep going. List at least fifty items or activities. When you see what you perceive to be the components of your ideal life, ask yourself, \"To what end?\" Unless you are depressed, in which case you probably would not even attempt this exercise, one or more concepts will start to appear. It is possible you may derive your passion in this way. As a young man recently graduated from university with less than a stellar GPA, I did not know what I could do well for my life's work. I could get into a lower level law school, and perhaps join my father's law firm, but at that time the law was not of real interest as a life's work. So, I asked my father his opinion of what I could do and be happy/passionate about. He took off his glasses and told me that in his opinion there were many jobs available to me. The key was helping other people in some capacity. He had observed that I was most excited when I was doing something to make someone's life better in some way. Wham! He was right and I realized it. So, I became an educator. More or less, forty years of having the opportunity to help others help themselves was a joy!  That's my story, now go and find yours. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Ask yourself this simple question: \u201cWhat would I do my entire life if there was no such thing as money?\u201d. Would you be an artist ? Would you spend working out all day and being fit ? Would you spend your days cycling on a bike ? Would you spend the entire day in front of the computer writing code ? Imagine for a while that there is no such thing as money. What would you do to spend your time in that case? As money is completely out of the equation, you will only think of doing things that you absolutely love to do i.e the things you are passionate about. Now you might think of things like laying on bed all day, eating and chatting with friends. However, you might do that for a while and would eventually be fed up of it as these activities keep your mind relaxed. My question is, what would you do to keep your mind engaged in a healthy way? What is something which you would enjoy doing, even if it\u2019s challenging and gives you a sense of accomplishment when you make progress ? Once you can answer this question, you have found your passion. Why most people cant correctly figure out their passion? A guy wanted to be an artist, according to him he was passionate about art. He imagined him selves to be a great artist who has his paintings in the worlds top art galleries and he being applauded by the crowd for his work. However, this is not what true passion is. The above guy is not passionate about art, he just craves to be a successful artist. This is where most people go wrong. A person can be said as truly passionate about art if he/ she enjoys the process of creating an art and does not care about the outcome at all. One who forgets to eat, sleep and drink just because they are so engaged in making an art. This is what true passion is. If you like wearing plush suits, drive a BMW and sit in a corporate office does not mean you have the passion for business. It\u2019s when you like marketing, love making new products/services, love taking care of your customers more than anything else then this is what is called as having a true passion for business. Passion is something when you enjoy doing something so much that you hardly care about the end result. ",

            "answer_text": "I love this question... but I hate the top answer. I totally get what this person is saying and I respect their right to say it..but I firmly disagree. Identifying and living your passions gives meaning to life. How do you discover your passion? You work it. Throwing your hands up and quitting is definitely an option... it's just a very risky one. Personally, I don't want to wake up one day and have regrets. Despite how difficult this pursuit is, there's good news: You don't become passionate. You discover your passions.There are systematic ways to approach finding your passion.You're not alone - in fact, most people I know wrestle with this.  Here are some systematic tools and frameworks I've found helpful: 1) Focus on Progress: It depends on your situation, but can you carve out some time every day to devote to discovering your passion? Inaction - while a feasible strategy - is not advisable...unless you want to wake up in 20 years and realize how unhappy you are.. [insert sad-face here]. 2) Start with Everything: Find a list of sectors and cross out the ones that you aren't interested in. Which question is easier to answer:  A) What's your passion in life?  B) Do you see yourself being a doctor? (Y/N) Question B is way easier to answer than A. Even if the answer isn't Yes or No, we can have a conversation about it, dig deeper, and maybe perform some tests to learn more. If it's no, then you can move onto the next sector/job/title/role/etc and ask a similar question. 3) Start (again) with Nothing: This is the blank piece of paper approach. Try to make a list of 3-5 things you would absolutely love to do. Don't hold back here at all. If you want to President of the US, write it down. If you want to be an investor, write it down. Even if it seems impossible, write it down.  Now take this list and ask \"Why\" for each item. Why do you want to be an astronaut? Because it's fun? It'll make you rich? You'll be in the public spotlight? etc. Ask Why again: Why do you want to be rich? So you can buy things? So you can get laid? So you can care for those with nothing? Ask why again. and again. and again. It can help to have a person for this step. Their job is to have a conversation with you and ask why a lot. Repeat this for each of these jobs. Do you see any trends? Are you repeatedly mentioning helping people or giving back or technology or children or batman? Pay attention to those things and start to march towards them. 4) Experiment More: If you think you might enjoy something or you're not sure, then test it. Call it an experiment and admit that you might fail and then just do it. I might recommend that you read this post as well: C.H.E.A.T. CHEAT stands for:- Choices- House Advantage- Experiences- Attitude- Team 5) Find Others: Seek out people who have been there are there right now. Message me and we can talk if you want. Giving back is one of my passions in life so don't hesitate to reach out.. Bottom Line: Folks don't typically wake up and realize that they're passionate about something. More often, people work hard to figure out what they're are truly passionate about. They struggle, they fail a bunch, they do things they hate in the meantime, and those who work hard enough usually find themselves doing the things they love more and more often.

            "answer_text": " Roll up your sleeves, and do a little detective work on yourself! But don\u2019t be afraid to do this. Actually, you probably already know what things you are passionate about, but this knowledge is hidden somewhere inside your mind. That\u2019s where the detective work comes in, because it\u2019s up to you to find what you\u2019re passionate about and bring it out in the daylight so you can observe it better and see it from all angles. Just a small tip: if you\u2019re going to try this, then don\u2019t forget to have some fun with it. It\u2019s a creative endeavor. So use your imagination, try out different options, and observe carefully how you react to each one. Here are 5 ideas to help you identify what you\u2019re passionate about. Idea #1. Befriend your inner child. Just because you are now grown up (or if you\u2019re like me, you openly say you\u2019re never going to be one hundred percent grown-up anyway!), that does not mean you should ignore the child you once were and that is still in you. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a college student, or you\u2019re working on your career, or you\u2019re a parent or an entrepreneur. It doesn\u2019t matter what stage of life you\u2019re currently in, because when it comes to passion, age is irrelevant. That\u2019s why it will benefit you greatly if you acknowledge that your inner child is still there, and ask what it wants to be when it grows up. Here\u2019s how. Write down at least 5 things your inner child tells you it want to become when it grows up. Take an hour or two for this exercise to really think it through. Don\u2019t limit yourself. Your answers can be as short or as long as you want them to be. The key is in writing it all down.Look over your list, and pick items that still speak to you that you may have forgotten. One, five, or ten years ago, did you have big plans to be a writer, a teacher, a painter, or an athlete? When was the last time you did any of those things? How did you feel when you were doing them? Write this down too.Make a plan to try something out. Specifically, make a plan for the following month to devote some time (for example, 1 hour in the evening, or twice a week if your schedule is full) to do one of the items you\u2019ve selected from the list. If you chose painting, for example, go buy a sketch pad and some watercolors and start with a basic drawing of an object you like or a favorite animal. Or, if you picked a sport you were really into and still like to practice, make the time to go to your local gym and start working out more seriously.Idea #2. Do something that really makes you feel good. As a grown-up, it\u2019s quite normal to feel that your life in adulthood is not at all what you once thought it would be. Do you feel like you now only have time for work but not for play? If so, you\u2019re not alone\u2014this is something we all feel from time to time. But there are things you can do to make a change and improve your life for the better. For example, you can create a ritual to follow every day that will give you pleasure. Here\u2019s how. If you're an avid reader, make the time to go to the library to pick a novel and read it for 30 minutes each evening before going to sleep.If you love music, learn how to play guitar or drums or the harmonica when you\u2019ve finished with your work or school assignments.If you enjoy writing, make it a priority to write one page in your journal either early in the morning or late at night when you have the time to organize your thoughts over a cup of tea.Idea #3. Make some space to let happiness into your life. Here\u2019s another area that goes along with becoming an adult. As we accumulate more responsibilities and our lives get busier and busier, we forget to focus on what\u2019s important. Instead, we often find ourselves getting distracted by obstacles we see in front of us. And as we switch our focus to those obstacles, we become more critical of ourselves, we\u2019re impatient when we don\u2019t perform well, and we get judgmental in evaluating our skills, achievements, even our intelligence. All it takes is to make a couple of small changes to see a difference. Here\u2019s how. Change your attitude towards yourself by practicing self-compassion. Forgive yourself for mistakes that you made in the past. They\u2019ve already happened, and you can\u2019t go back in time. You can learn from them, but don\u2019t hold on to them. This applies to your relationships, your career, your education, and other areas of your life in which you feel you have underperformed.Actively look for what you can do to become happier. One of Harvard University\u2019s top lecturers, Tal Ben-Shahar, wrote a book called Happier: Learn the Secrets to Daily Joy and Lasting Happiness. He focuses on positive psychology and how to apply the concept of happiness to daily life, for example in school, the workplace, and in our personal relationships.Allow yourself some time to daydream. Not every minute of the day needs to be scheduled for work, study, personal, or professional responsibilities. Allow yourself to stare out the train window on your daily commute and watch the world go by. Go for a walk without a specific agenda, other than to let yourself be by yourself. Sit somewhere with your headphones and listen to music that brings you peace or gives you energy.Idea #4. Identify a personal goal you can aspire to. As you\u2019re working hard to study for a college degree or to build a career, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t neglect your personal development. Start by asking yourself some tough questions. For example: where do you want to be 5 or 10 years from now? Who do you want to become? What is your ideal scenario\u2014perhaps living in a different city or country, having a partner to share your life journey with, being surrounded by smart and interesting people who contribute to your personal growth, or mastering jiujitsu? Get specific, be honest with yourself, then follow up with some action. Here\u2019s how. Write down your top 3 personal goals. If you want to make sure you have enough time to focus on this activity, then set aside an hour or two this weekend to get serious about it.Under each goal, write 3 things you would need to do consistently to get results. Want to get fit? Your three things could be to educate yourself on what types of food are healthier and can give you energy, set a schedule to work out 4 times a week, and start going to bed early.Create a schedule for the week ahead. Nothing will actually get done unless you plan for it. Consistency is key, so you need to devote blocks of time ( starting with 30 minutes, for example) to make progress in the areas you\u2019ve identified.Do an assessment of the progress you made. A good idea is to review your efforts at the end of the week. Ask yourself, did some activities take more time than you anticipated? Why did they take as long? What could you have done better? Then make adjustments for the following week.Idea #5. Fuel your motivation by jumpstarting your mornings. To give yourself some extra time to pursue the things you\u2019ve identified as your passions, you can consider mornings. Why? Because creating a morning routine can set the tone to your entire day, and give you a positive mindset to keep making progress on the things you feel passionate about. Here\u2019s how. Start waking up just 15 minutes earlier. If you usually wake up at 7 a.m., set your morning alarm to 6:45. Keep this schedule for one week. The next week, set it again to 15 minutes earlier, this time for 6:30 a.m. Gradually increase the increments until you reach one hour. The benefit? You won\u2019t feel the big change, and you\u2019re more likely to keep the habit. An hour of free time for yourself is priceless!Eat some brain food. Start the day with breakfast that will fill you up, give you energy, and improve cognitive function. Here are 3 breakfast ideas. Oatmeal mixed with peanut butter and fresh fruit, a parfait made with Greek yogurt and topped with granola and fruit, or eggs\u2014they\u2019re a powerful mix of B vitamins, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids keep your nerve cells functioning at optimal speed.Do a short burst of exercise. Pick a fast, easy to follow, and targeted workout to help your body wake up and prepare for the day ahead. Here are some ideas for a 10\u201315 minute wake-up session: a morning yoga routine, a set of sun salutation poses, or a quick set of sprints in your neighborhood to allow your mind and body to stay on the right track and keep doing what you enjoy!",

            "answer_text": "I've been sick in bed for the past four days. I was barely able to move. I wasn't able to do a thing (ok, it wasn't that bad). Today, I finally started feeling a bit better. And the first thing I could think about while taking my morning walk were ideas about things I could write about. I wrote all of my ideas down on a post-it. Within ten minutes both sides of the post-it were full of ideas. I also had to think about one of my last posts where I talked about finding your passion. I came to the conclusion that finding your passion is about doing things that amaze you. That you love. That you would also do if no one paid you for it. But I somehow got the feeling that this wasn't enough. That there has to be more to this. How do you even know if you really love something? You might think that you love something for ten, twenty, thirty years and then all of a sudden you realize that you don't. Boom! Gone. Forever. So here are a few things I believe are a pretty good indicator that you really love something (and should put all of your energy into it). That something might be your passion. The true purpose why you were sent here. # TRIAL & ERROR A lot of people believe (including myself until quite recently) that finding the things you love and are passionate about is a linear thing. That it's something that you've been good at all of your life. But I feel that the exact opposite is true. When I was young I was very good at all sorts of sports. I was good at football, basketball, track & field, you name it. I actually never lost a sprint in my entire life. And you know what I'm doing right now? Every single day, I'm sitting on my ass in front of a laptop, writing about all sorts of stuff. I'm doing the exact opposite of what I was good at back then. I always sucked at writing in high school. I was really, really bad. I was one of the worst in my class. Still, that's what I'm now doing (or at least trying to) every single day. And I guess the reason is quite simple. We're not really interested in the things we can get quite easily. We lose interest in these things quite fast. For most of us things have to be challenging. Every single day. If it's not challenging enough we lose interest. Or start to hate it. Just like people say that men lose interest in women that are crazy about them. Just like people say that women are not interested in caring, loving and affectionate men (in the long run). They want a challenge. We all enjoy a little challenge. And the best challenge is to conquer someone, to become good at something we suck at and to prove someone wrong. I guess that's sort of human nature. We always prefer taking up a challenge. A challenge that makes us feel alive, instead of feeling dead inside. At least until we reach a certain age. Then we usually lower our standards and start settling for a lot less than we actually deserve or are able to achieve.. # SICK IN BED If it's the first thing you can think about after you've been sick for a few days that's probably quite a good indicator that you really love what you're doing (even, no especially, when you're not getting paid for it). For example, I could have thought about all sorts of things, instead of thinking about stuff I could write about. A big fat steak. Mhhhh. Getting out for drinks with friends. Going out for a party. You name it. But the first and only thing I could think of doing today was writing. And nothing else.. # IF IT GETS DIFFICULT The moment you start to go more deeply into a subject that really matters to you, it'll start to become difficult. When you start caring about something it means you want to be really good at it. And that's the moment when it gets difficult. And hard. And that's where a lot of people quit. Because failing at something you deeply care about, something you felt like it's your purpose in life, is not just a possibility, but it's almost guaranteed. So instead of embracing our fear we simply stop. But once you hit that point you need to keep on pushing. No matter what. Because that's the only way you can give your gift to the world. That's the only way to mastery. The gift this world so desperately needs.. # LEARN If I don't write, I read. I read because I know that I don't know anything about writing. Fortunately, there are thousands of other people out there that know a hell lot about writing. That know a hell lot about how to write. I believe that only once you're willing to accept the fact that you don't know anything about your art, does it mean that you truly and deeply care about it. That you really love it. That you're passionate about it. Only if you're able to leave your ego at the door and are willing to learn from the masters (and even less skilled people), does it mean that you truly and deeply care about something. That you ultimately love it.. # NO EXPECTATIONS A good way to test whether or not you love what you're doing is to ask yourself the following question: Would I also do this if I didn't get paid for doing it? I guess that's the ultimate question. If you say no, that's quite a good indicator that you don't really love what you're doing. I'm not saying that everybody should work for free, not at all. I just feel that this is good way to test how serious you are about it. To be absolutely and totally sure that you love something is that you don't have any expectations, whatsoever. But this is an absolute zen-like way of seeing things. Even I expect something in return for my writing. I expect (actually I hope) that people like my writing. And that it makes them rethink their now. That it makes them rethink their perspective on some things. Or at least to ask themselves questions they would otherwise not have asked themselves.. Oh wow, I guess I need a quick break before jumping right into the next point. My head starts spinning a bit. I think I'm not fully operational, yet.. # SOCIETY If you truly love what you're doing you stop thinking about what others might think about you. You simply don't care about it anymore. What you start caring about are the people that think like you. You stop caring about gatekeepers, naysayers, critics and everybody else that wants you to continue living your life in prison. Society's prison. Instead, you'll express your truest, inner most self and create things without thinking about the norm. You create things that inspire other people to do the same. You create new things, amazing things, unconventional things and things that not only break the rules, but that create new rules. Not only do you stop caring about common conventions, but you might even start changing a few people's lives. Or the way they think about themselves. Or the world around them. That's the true gift of doing what you love and giving back at the same time.. # SACRIFICE Doing what you love is not easy. It's very, very hard. You might lose some friends, your gf/bf or whatever. You'll have to sacrifice a lot. You'll have to say goodbye to eating fancy diners, driving a fancy car, living in a fancy apartment and many other things. And not just for a short period of time. Maybe forever. You might never be able to afford the same things you would have been able to afford if you stayed at your day job. That's just a matter of fact. And believing that doing what you love will one day allow you to live a similar or even better life than the one you would have lived if you stayed at your day job is just a big fat illusion. It might work out for some people. Will it work out for you? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. Probably not.. # YOU BUILD YOUR LIFE AROUND IT Doing what you love and trying to find your passion will ultimately require you to build a life around it. A life that allows you to still be able to somehow pay the bills while doing what you love. Because being able to pay the bills doing what you love might take many, many years. Or you might never be able to pay the bills. Who knows? The funny part about it is that you still have to believe in yourself that you'll be able to make it nevertheless. Paired with a bit of realism, the best solution (at least for me) is to build some stuff around my writing that somehow pays the bills (even though none of it has really worked out, yet). So you will not only have to focus all of you energy on doing what you love and becoming one of the best and most talented at your craft, because that's the only way you might maybe one day be able to pay your bills, but you also need to build some stuff around it that pays the bills. If that sounds like too much work, you might not really love what you're doing. --- But who am I to talk about any of this? Don't listen to me. Don't believe me. You should never ever believe me. Just try. After having read all of this and you still believe that you really and truly love something, just do it. Now. If you believe that you don't truly love what you're doing, do something else. Life is short. Don't waste it doing something you don't love. You might have loved it yesterday, last year or when you were still a kid. There is no guarantee that you'll still love doing it once you're old and retired. That you'll still love it in twenty or thirty years. We change. A lot. So do the thing you love right now. Don't wait for you to change. Do it while you still love it. Don't even waste a single second. If you want to do what you love, don't wait for tomorrow. Because that tomorrow will probably never ever come. And that's ultimately the way to finding your passion and purpose in life.. Want to read more stories like this one?

            "answer_text": "Ask yourself if there anything you'd miss if it was gone? When answering, start at a really \"low\" level. By which I mean don't bother asking yourself if you'd miss a particular TV show or brand of shoes. - Would you miss eating if you didn't get to do it any more? If I could give you a pill that would keep you nourished, would you be totally fine with never eating or drinking again? - Would you miss sleeping/relaxing? - Would you miss sex? - Would you miss intimacy with another person? - Would you miss being better at certain skills than other people? - Would you miss learning? - Would you miss collecting/hoarding/gathering possessions? - Would you miss jokes/laughter? - Would you miss intense feelings? - Would you miss helping people? - Would you miss collaborating? - Would you miss commanding? - Would you miss following? - Would you miss aggression? - Would you miss competition? - Would you miss building/creating things? - Would you miss problem-solving and puzzles? - Would you miss sensations? (E.g bubble baths, music, art?) - Would you miss spirituality? - Would you miss stories?  - Would you miss goals? - Would you miss playing/being silly? - Would you miss travel/exploring? - Would you miss order? (E.g. rules/laws/systems?) - Would you miss chaos? - Would you miss moving/sports/dancing? - Would you miss hanging out with friends? Would you be extremely upset if any of the above items/experiences was stolen from you forever? If so, you're on the road to finding your passion(s). If not, you might want to see a doctor (if it bothers you). If you feel meh about all-of-the-above, you're abnormally lacking in affect. Some people are, and there are various treatments. It's also possible that you'd be very unhappy without certain items on my list, but that you don't know you'd be unhappy. Some people just aren't good at imaginative introspection. You could try depriving yourself of certain things for a while to see how much you miss them. If your problem is just that you get bored easily, that doesn't mean you're necessarily passionless. I have a passion for directing plays, but I would not want to work on the same play for rest of my life -- or even for two years. There's a spectrum of novelty/thrill-seeking, and we're all somewhere on it. I am addicted to fiction, but I need a new book or movie pretty much every day. I guess you could say I have a passion for stories in general rather than any particular story.  Most things we call passions can be traced back to items on my low-level list. I say I have a passion for directing plays, but, at a lower level, my passions are stories, collaboration, and problem solving. I wouldn't want to lose theatre, but if you told me I had to, I'd be okay as long as I could keep stories, collaboration and problem-solving in my life! At some point, when I was young, I hadn't \"found\" theatre yet. I still had passions. They were just low-level. Most of us find homes for our low-level passions simply by living and experiencing. We -- eventually -- have an aha! moment where the shoe of some experiences fits the foot of a primal urge. Maybe you just haven't lived enough yet to find your shoe.  Finally, I suggest you separate actual passions from social exceptions, such as choosing a major or career. Those are important decisions, and they can (if you're lucky) coincide with passions, but just because someone berates you for not choosing a major, it doesn't follow that you're passionless.  True passions don't care about opinion. There's some really, really silly stuff that I'm into. For instance, I love Poptarts. To me, they're the perfect food. I sound like an idiot if I say I have a passion for Poptarts, but me not-wanting-to-sound-like-an-idiot doesn't change the fact that I fucking love Poptarts! We don't control our passions. ",

            "answer_text": "Three events happened that helped me get on the right road: First\u2014 it was 1978, I was 24 and had spent 3.5 years of pre-med, studying to be a doctor. While in the lab, my eye caught a little window, on a fire escape door. Through it, I could see a tree branch shimmering in the sun, dazzling. A voice said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful you could spend of your life in here, and not out there.\u201d Second\u2014 at that time philosopher, Joseph Campbell was on PBS talking about \u201cFollowing your bliss\u201d. https://www.brainpickings.org/20... I thought back to when I was deliriously happy. It did not matter what I was actually doing. I thought of the day my little brother, 8, and I sold hats to the visitors at Graceland. I was the one year after Elvis\u2019s death, August 16, 1978. My dad was a small business entrepreneur. He said, \u201cThere must be 50,000 fans down there, go sell them something, I\u2019ll watch on TV\u201d. I said OK you\u2019re on. Sam and I sat on the curb and watched the long line across the street. A brilliant woman was selling a single rose for $10. Suddenly, an ambulance arrived. Someone fainted from heat exhaustion. I grabbed Henry by the hand and we drove the Surplus City. We bought every wide-brimmed Mexican style hat for $1.50. Stacked them on Henry\u2019s head and went in the crowd. You had to have a solid $5.00 bill. I held on to your wrist, took the money, put a hat in your hand and let go of your wrist-that how many people were on me for a hat. Now that was FUN! The third event happened while I was getting a Coke at the machine between graduate school classes. A man came up to me and asked me what I was going to do when I graduated. He and I had debated in class. He was an old guy (like I am now). He asked if I would like a job at Schering-Plough in Memphis (Maybelline, Coppertone, and Dr. Scholl\u2019s). Turned out he was Senior VP for Finance and Operations getting his PhD. He said it was for a Brand Manager. I had no idea what that was. I went to the library and looked it up (all paper then). It was a bolt of lightning. I could solve problems for millions of people across the nation. I could also work with chemists, lawyers, engineers, sales people, and artists. Together, we would build the solution. That was 40 years ago. https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdfa... None of this would have happened if I had not listened to that little voice in the lab. ",

            "answer_text": "My biggest passion failed. Had I pursued my first passion, my life would be very different, potentially much worse than where I actually ended up. My second passion drove me to become a millionaire and retiree at age 28. Now, as a entrepreneur, my second passion has entirely replaced my first passion in life. I\u2019m grateful I can share and utilize my skills to inspire others to access the same opportunities I had to reach financial freedom at a young age. I can say with 99% definitiveness that my second passion is actually my real calling, my purpose, and my primary identity, as it turned out. Here are a few lessons I learned about Passion along the way: #1. Your passions, while deeply meaningful, may not make sense practically. My first passion in life was (and still is) singing. I had been winning awards and contests since I was 14. I truly thought I had the core talent, early in life to make a living out of singing. My strategy was to utilize my fluent English skills and ride the increasingly popular Americanization wave just developing at that point in the Chinese Mandarin market. However, my mom (as you can imagine most Chinese immigrant parents) was staunchly against encouraging my dreams. At a young age, I was constantly belittled and chastised by my mother in her efforts to dissuade me from pursuing Chinese pop-stardom as a career. She would taunt me about how everyone was better than me and I\u2019d never amount to anything as a singer. Since I wasn\u2019t born from wealth, my mom saw the odds from afar, much clearer than I could. I was enraptured in my dreams and could see nothing other than the glory of my inevitable success. She knew for someone like me who was not professionally trained and possessed average looks could only go so far in the media industry, which is a grueling and less glamorous industry than it seems. My mom couldn\u2019t financially afford to support my passion nor give me an advantage over others. Therefore, she tried her best to shield me from my passion in an effort to protect me against this threat to my future. #2. Sometimes, passions can hurt you more than help you. My dream and passion of singing died a slow and painful death. I refused to take my mom\u2019s advice and staunchly decided to pursue my talents. For people who have multiple talents, whether that\u2019s athletic, within the arts, or in any other specialism, we often have the confidence to dream bigger with our skillset. There\u2019s a catch: just because you could be very good at something, even at the mastery level, there is a huge difference between the top 10% and the top 1% that actually can make it in an industry. Life doesn\u2019t give you too many chances and every step you take will have lasting consequences. For instance, if you bet your life on your sports career and you get hurt, that setback could hurt, if not end, your career. Therefore, the talent who does survive in those fields, tend to be paid above and beyond for their skill and sustainability, a reflection of the economic reality of a scarcity in the market of people who can perform at that level through the long-term. My mom saw my talent for what it was, a dangerous illusion that could rob me of my actual future that would instead need to be dependent on a long-term skill to survive. As we all know, in the entertainment industry, the life-span of most artists are relatively limited, so statistically, my odds of success were so low that my mom was terrified I\u2019d actually sabotage my future pegged on my pipe dream. #3. Self-awareness on how much you\u2019re willing to sacrifice will help you clarify your purpose. After college graduation, real life called. My parents made some business decisions that left me in charge of my family\u2019s Chinese restaurant. That year, I progressed within a contest that asked me to go to China to compete on a national televised singing contest! However, by that point, I had a familial duty to help my parents survive. Our little restaurant paid the bills. If I left, there would be no one to pay our bills. How I hated my parents and extended family then! While everyone in my family was off pursuing their own interests, I was stuck doing my duty as a responsible and filial daughter, running a dinky restaurant that didn\u2019t even pay me a real salary. I truly loathed my entire life, family, and the world for this gross injustice of watching my dreams die. However, I had to move on. I couldn\u2019t live in hate or bitterness because it made me an angry and miserable person to be around. What I realized when I started reflecting on my life that year, was that it wasn\u2019t my parents that I hated. It was myself and my own lack of confidence! Self-awareness proved to me that I didn\u2019t have the guts to ditch my familial duties to pursue my dreams. That fault lies on me alone. If it were Madonna or Prince, they would have already left their parents. They probably wouldn\u2019t have gone to college in the first place! They would have had the level of confidence required to run away from home for their dreams, throw their future away without any regrets. I didn\u2019t have that same level of passion for my passion. #4. Move on to other passions. At age 22, I was too young to be struck down by life. I had too much optimism to let this early but great disappointment ruin my life. Even though I dreamed of Chinese popstar-dom as a singular objective, I had to find a way to move on as life after college progressed. After a period of bitterness and mourning, I started reading self-help books as a way to get on with my life. Once I fully accepted my own responsibility for my life, I analyzed my other passions. One of the reasons why I was so interested in singing, was for the most part, a desire for the reward that could be achieved once fame was acquired: wealth. That ultimately was the driver behind all my passions, the desire to live an extraordinary life, to possess the power that comes with financial success. Therefore, I shifted my focus into the passion to earn money, choosing to take a risk to become a headhunter, a career driven by commission, revenue generation, and sales mastery. I shifted my focus from singing to immersing myself into my sales career as a recruiter at 22. This decision changed my whole life. #5. Invest in a passion that you can create a true life off of with relatively low risk in accordance to your strengths. Since I didn\u2019t want to work a boring 9\u20135 or work for 40 years before retiring, I wanted to fully maximize my sales job to take me out of poverty. I had no family money, still possessed student and car debt, and had no real skills outside of singing. The jobs I held were mostly blue collar like waitressing, bartending, landscaping, painting, helping out on simple white collar analyst jobs where I did administrative work. Through all those jobs, I slowly accumulated an advantage in one thing: communicating effectively with others. Since I had to manage difficult customers, handle a lot of stress relating to working grueling hours, and sometimes gross physical labor (cleaning out nasty oil traps, dealing with pests, etc.), I became very confident as a speaker and communicator and could tolerate tough working conditions. I knew how to sell an idea, persuade others, and interact with all types of people. I leveraged my communication skills into my recruitment job with the same dreams I possessed towards my first passion. I wanted to be world-class and famous as a recruiter. Since I worked at a global company, I reached immediate fame year one as a top rookie and my career continued to skyrocket. I went from being a broke and confused college graduate at 22 to earning over $215k yearly as a 25 year old top-biller. I became a real estate investor as a side hustle and parlayed all of my recruitment income into real estate and securities investments, eventually retiring at 28 from needing a job. #5. Continue refining your passions as your life, skillset, financial risk tolerance, and personal situation changes. If you asked me at 15 what my future would have been, I would have said something uneducated and irresponsible. In hindsight, I was much too naive and overconfident in my skills which, while good, were certainly limited. My work ethic and passion for my craft, while good, were not enough to truly be enough. Had I embarked on my journey to become a singer in China, I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019d be today. I\u2019m not here to naysay against others\u2019 dreams, but if you\u2019re like me when it comes to singing, and feel that others got in the way of your own success, then you probably wouldn\u2019t have become successful at it anyways! Even if you had others\u2019 backing, the odds of success would have been the same. It\u2019s not others\u2019 that can change your reality; it\u2019s ourselves who are driven by our own interests and persevere in our own endeavors. For many people who reach the top of their field, they did it DESPITE others\u2019 naysaying. If you blame others for your lack of success, you will not only continue to fail, but also regress in your self-development. If I had truly possessed the same amount confidence to succeed I had going into recruitment, then I probably would have been able to realize my dream of becoming a singer. However, I didn\u2019t and I still don\u2019t. What changed was that, despite my mother\u2019s protests on my career choice in sales, I knew I could succeed as a headhunter. For once, I found something I could not only be good at, but succeed at long-term. There are truly so many people out there better than me at singing. But in headhunting, I am in much more control and I\u2019m now one of the top recruiters in my industry with a very distinct and sustainable competitive advantage. Best of all, since I focused on leveraging my passions in my career, I love what I do. Everyone\u2019s passions will inevitably shift with the passage of time, aging, and also changes in family and financial demands. For instance, if I were to all of a sudden get married and have kids, my priorities and passions would change in an instant due to the demands of family life. There is no shame in pivoting and changing strategies. In Conclusion No matter what your passions and hobbies are, you\u2019re in control of your life trajectory. You can increase your confidence and self-belief in the direction of passions that will actually create a sustainable life for yourself, and pay you back for your investment with a strong degree of certainty. The worst is to spend your whole life going after things that have a small chance of success and end up regretting the time you wasted and the economic opportunities you missed as a result of those poor choices. That\u2019s why self-awareness of your capability, strengths, weaknesses, and competitive attributes can help pave the way through self-introspection on what path you should take and commit to. Ultimately, when you do determine your direction leveraging your talent and passion, you have to be responsible for that decision and see it through. As they say: the only way through is through. Once you make a commitment, you can\u2019t keep shifting every other day. Focus, hard work, and perseverance are all required to achieve self-actualization. ",

Only recently I've been able to overcome it. Here's how.. First of all, you need to understand that \u201cfollow your passion\u201d is horrible advice that is basically making a ton self help gurus rich. It's the easiest thing to sell in the world as it feeds off our deepest fears and insecurity of living a boring and meaningless life. It's too abstract and way too generalized to help anyone. It's like saying \u201cBe amazing\u201d. Be amazing at what?? Second, there's an erroneous belief that to live a life of passion (or find a career your passionate about) you follow these steps: Find what you're passionate aboutGo after it as if your life depended on itWhat's wrong with that? Well considering most 18\u201326 year olds life experience includes sitting in a classroom reading outdated text books and getting wasted on the weekends, it's completely illogical to expect them to discover their passion. As if they could just have a dream about it and wake up knowing what they are destined to do the rest of their life So how do you discover your passion? Passion isn't something you just stumble upon. It's created. Think of the people you believe that have truly lived a life of passion. I'll use Steve Jobs for example because of his famous speech on following your passion. I truly believe Steve Jobs did live a life of passion and I'm sure most people would agree with me. But what most people fail to realize is that he didn't just wake up one day and decide he wanted to start the greatest computer company in the world. Hell, I don\u2019t even believe he was passionate about computers. I believe he created his passion for them over time, but staring out he had no idea where he was headed. And more than a passion for computers and technology, he created a passion for how he could create amazing things and have an impact on people's lives. And he developed a passion around how much control he had over his professional life. But that didn't come overnight. It came through him working hard in a certain direction and taking the best opportunities that were presented to him Some people don't get as many opportunities as others, but that doesn't matter. You can still develop a life of passion no matter your circumstances. 3 INGREDIENTS TO A PASSIONATE AND MEANINGFUL CAREER CreativityImpactControlThinking of the Steve Jobs example, when you can have a career that allows you to create, have a positive impact on people (no matter how big or small), and have control, you'll begin to develop a passion for it\u2014no matter what you do. It's not so much \u201cwhat you're doing\u201d as to \u201chow you're doing it.\u201d Especially right now when you're in your early to mid 20s. Right now the most important thing you can do is apply yourself to a career that you see will allow you to have these three aspects. Creativity. Impact. Control. You don't even have to worry about your \u201ccareer\u201d. Because the likelyhood of you staying with the same job your whole life is slim to none. Instead, focus on developing skills that will allow you to achieve a life with those three things. I suggest 4 particular skills that have extreme versatility that I believe can be applied to basically anything: MarketingSalesNetworkingLeadershipI chose these skills because they all directly apply to entrepreneurship. Usually, most people who want to live meaningful lives choose entrepreneurship because it's one of the only paths that allows you to have complete control over your life, create everyday, and your potential to have an impact on people's lives is limitless. But you don't have to be an entrepreneur. Many people live extremely meaningful lives that work as employees. But they usually all have the three ingredients, and it usually takes much longer to achieve. I hope this helps you demystify the \u201cfollow your passion\u201d black hole. About a year ago I stopped trying to figure out what my passion was and started focusing on developing those skills listed above. Now I feel a passion and drive that I've never felt before. My life is slowly but surely becoming more and more clear of where I want to end up and I'm 100x more confident about where I'm headed. But in the dark confusing land of trying to discover my passion, everything seemed gray and the future was hazy. Get out of that land. P.S. If you want even more details on developing the skills that I've talked about, I wrote an article that dives deeper into this: Leaving Your Job For Your Passion Could Be The Biggest Mistake You Make. . .Unless you do it the right way.

            "answer_text": "Forget about finding your passion. It's a bullshit platitude that doesn't mean anything. I'm INCREDIBLY passionate about the Grand Theft Auto games. Seriously, I put in hours and hours on those games when I was a kid (and I still do now). I could take or leave a lot of video games, but when it comes to GTA, I don't know anyone who loves that series more than I do. I could tell you the location of almost all of the gang tags in GTA:SA. I used to fly the Dodo around GTA3 for 2-3 hours at a time, just because I could. I still have a few songs by Love Fist on my iTunes. So I've found my passion. Great! The problem is, no one will pay me to sit on my arse all day playing GTA. I could write some guides about it, I could do YouTube gameplay videos, or I could get a job at Rockstar as a QA guy, but that would turn my passion into a job, and it wouldn't be interesting. So forget about finding your passion. It's not the magic bullet that you think it is, believe me. Not to mention that the idea you should do ONE THING and stick to that is nonsense. Look at Steve Jobs: he created amazing things at the intersection of art and technology. Elon Musk is at the intersection between physics and business. Here's what you need to do instead: develop useful skills. Pick something that you're somewhat interested in -- whether that's writing, programming, graphic design, accounting -- and get very, very good at it.  What skill should you pick to get good at? Well, what do you like doing? If the answer to that is \"I don't know\", then you need to get out there, and try lots and lots of different things. You can't just sit in a dark room, meditating and introspecting, completing personality questionnaires to figure out what colour your parachute is and what your MBTI is, and then emerge three days later having figured out exactly what they're supposed to do in life. You have to go out and interact with the real world, find something you like doing, and then focus -- REALLY FOCUS -- on that one thing, and become great at it. Because here's the secret. People don't get good at something because they're passionate about it. They become passionate once they become good at that thing. Passion follows performance. Go and pick up a copy of So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love by Cal Newport. Read it, cover to cover -- twice -- and then get to work.

            "answer_text": "Passion\u2014it\u2019s all about passion. Find your passion. Live passionately. Inspire the world with your passion. People go to Burning Man to find passion, to be around passion, to rekindle their passion. Same goes for TED and the now enormous SXSW and a thousand other events, retreats, and summits, all fueled by what they claim to be life\u2019s most important force. Here\u2019s what those same people haven\u2019t told you: your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with\u2014no, because of\u2014passion. Early on in her ascendant political career, a visitor once spoke of Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cpassionate interest\u201d in a piece of social legislation. The person had meant it as a compli\u00adment. But Eleanor\u2019s response is illustrative. \u201cYes,\u201d she did support the cause, she said. \u201cBut I hardly think the word \u2018passionate\u2019 applies to me.\u201d As a genteel, accomplished, and patient woman born while the embers of the quiet Victorian virtues were still warm, Roo\u00adsevelt was above passion. She had purpose. She had direction. She wasn\u2019t driven by passion, but by reason. George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld, on the other hand, were passionate about Iraq. Christopher McCandless was bursting with passion as he headed \u201cinto the wild.\u201d So was Robert Falcon Scott as he set out to explore the arctic, bitten as he was with \u201cthe Pole mania\u201d (as were many climbers of the tragic 1996 Everest climb, momentarily struck with what psychologists now call \u201cgoalodicy\u201d). The inventor and investors of the Segway believed they had a world\u00ad changing innovation on their hands and put everything into evangelizing it. That all of these talented, smart individuals were fervent believers in what they sought to do is without dispute. It\u2019s also clear that they were also unprepared and incapable of grasping the objections and real concerns of everyone else around them. Passion in this sense is just ego. Pure and plain destructive ego. It\u2019s self-absorption at the expense of reality. ",

            "answer_text": "You've got to go on an adventure, and explore through many different things. won't hurt to look in your past for clues either. When I was a little girl, my mum sent me for piano lessons. After just a few weeks, everyone started telling me that I was musically gifted and that that was one of the best things I could do in life, to pursue a career in playing the piano somehow. As that was one of the only skills I thought I had, I roled with it, never realising that it wasn't my true passion. Meanwhile, this same little girl found herself creating random stories out of nowhere, taking joy in using a video camera to make random videos and just singing in random places. It didn't really emerge until later, but a bit of acting was also involved. I started getting lots of creative ideas and started putting short stories onto paper. I started imagining vivid fictional worlds and characters and I also started wanting to make some sort of mini movie using my mum's phone's video camera. Creating was my thing, but I didn't know it at the time because I thought it was all just childish play. To me, this was fun, but piano was going to be my job, so I would focus on that . Then, when I turned 12, I started figuring out how to write songs with lyrics in them. They weren't that good, cringy even when I look back now but that ignited something in me. I wanted to sing, and keep singing, and harmonise... Though playing the piano brought me satisfaction, knowing I was good at something, it didn't bring me the joy singing did. So I joined my school's choir, and as the years passed, got exposed to many different types of music. I just wanted to sing them all. First, it was just my original songs but after a while, I also wanted to do my own renditions of songs that were already made, covers basically. I turned to YouTube as a means to try doing something I love. I had literally no experience with video editing, but I worked with what I had. As time passed and I began collaborating with more people on YouTube, I gained more knowledge and experiences on how to do it. As time passed, I found myself wanting to get more and more creative in order to make more interesting YouTube videos. I would experiment with scripts, story ideas, voice acting and stuff like that. Some of my friends introduced me to theatre musicals and I found myself enjoying them a great deal. I began trying to act out some scenes at home, while writing certain things out in script form to plan for future videos. I would audition for different projects and work on voice acting as there were a few people who had inspired me to try it even before I started my channel. I found myself enjoying the creative and learning experience a great deal and realising that, in a way it's a more professional version of the videos and stories I used to create as a child. Back then, I would also make videos, create my own characters and lines and, for the fun of it try to voice my own characters. I didn't know it was an actual passion of mine, but turns out it was! As for singing, I just found that it brought me great joy. Exploring different areas of it, I've come to realise which genres suit my voice. It took a bit of exploring, experimenting and even took some time, but soon I found the genre that best fits my voice, and it's none other than theatre musicals. Along with it, I started exploring new stuff and expanding from just merely voice acting to wanting to learn how to act in plays and musicals. As for writing, I had been doing it for years but the more I did it, the more I realised that putting my thoughts down or simply writing a fictional story gave me a sense of joy while I did it. But what about piano? What did I do with it? Well, today the piano is my primary instrument. I play it for fun and it helps me to write songs. However, I don't intend to pursue it professionally anymore. It's just not something I feel like I would like to do in life. Same goes with songwriting, I love it but it's mostly a way for me to get my feelings and emotions out. I don't intend to pursue that as a permanent profession either, at least in terms of releasing albums and stuff, but rather to do it as a hobby. I won't rule it out completely though. It's still early to say, Who knows, maybe I could combine it with my writing somehow and make some sort of script with original songs? You never know. Writing, singing and acting are my three main passions at least for now, but it took me awhile to find them because I once believed that there was a bridge between what I loved to do for fun and what I was learning to do for a professional career. That isn't always true. They don't necessarily have to be two separate things, one could just be an extension of the other. To find your dream, passion or purpose, look at what makes you happy, even if it's something as simple as making short videos, drawing or even getting creative with Legos. See what drives you forward, embrace what you love to do and go with it. It doesn't necessarily have to be something you are good at. It will take time, it might even take years to figure out what you truly like. But you will. Just keep trying, and never stop trying for you might discover new things about yourself as you go along, sometimes even things you didn't expect you would enjoy. One day, you will find your true passion! Good luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "This might not sound like other answers, but here goes: You CAN\u2019T. You can\u2019t FIND your passion; you CREATE your passion. Yes, there are some people who have a wonderful, transcendent moment that causes them to somehow forget themselves and immediately know what their passion is, but this isn\u2019t you and it isn\u2019t me. Stories like this are actually rare, and you can\u2019t depend on them. What regular people like you and I have to do is simply find something that we want to do, however small, and begin to do it. With regular effort this can turn into a passion. I\u2019ve gone through this myself with both comedy and sales and I can share with you how this is possible: Follow your desires, even if they\u2019re \u201cclose to home\u201d - When I started doing comedy (at the tender age of 14) I wasn\u2019t looking to discover my passion, I was really trying to find a place for me away from kids who bullied me. But by going to improv classes (which was a club at my high school) and getting on stage I found I started to like improv. Soon I was trying to get up as much as possible, and was looking for even more and more opportunities, which lead to stand-up and a new career and passion.Find what you love about things you\u2019re doing - After graduating from college I had no job. I\u2019ve written about it before. I started doing independent sales as a necessity. At first it was the worst, and I was terrified about rejection. Soon, I started to appreciate the feeling of the thrill of the cold call, even if I hated and feared the rejection. Soon, I loved it more than the fear. Soon I loved it so much I tried to get it. Soon the fear didn\u2019t matter at all and I began succeeding at sales. A passion was created.Set your goals, work to make them happen - That\u2019s it. Once you feel that you have some control then push your edge. The working to get better will engender a passion of the material in you.It isn\u2019t about discovering your passion, it\u2019s about creating your passion. Your passion is created as you work yourself into the material of your life, lose yourself in it. Stay in touch with my latest comedy, articles, videos, and more on my email list.

            "answer_text": "The problem is that we've lost any real sense of what 'passion' means. It's not what gives you bliss or makes you happy 24/7, but what you're willing to suffer for -- what you genuinely believe to be worth the sacrifice. The next time you feel energized and strong and like the best version of yourself -- the you that you wish you could be all the time -- pay attention to what you're doing *in that moment*. Write it down. Do this for as long as it takes until you see a pattern emerging. It won't necessarily be the activities themselves -- but they will have something in common. Look into them and behind them until you find what dramatists call a throughline: the essence of what you're good at and what drives you. I spent most of my lifetime thinking that my passion is for writing, and for fiction in particular. But when I stepped back a bit and considered the other activities that light me up and make me feel a sense of wholeness (including my love of social media!), I realized that my passion is for emotional resonance, be it with a friend or spouse or audience or even the culture in general. I like moving into that sweetspot where something in my inner life overlaps with another consciousness, including a kind of group consciousness. That might sound like I should be lighting sticks of incense and showing off my dreamcatcher collection, but it is the *best* feeling. Writing is my main expression of that, but when I find ways to bring it into other areas of my life, I am a happy (happier) woman. We confuse the activity with the value behind the activity. It's the value that compels us -- and which we can transfer to paid-income work in a way that changes lives (and the industry itself). What Steve Jobs was passionate about was not computers per se, any more than it was calligraphy or Japanese gardening. It was simplicity*. He made it his obsession and his art. He introduced it to an industry that, as far as it was concerned, was doing just fine without it. Simplicity drove the Apple identity: the strategy, the products and marketing and branding, the presentations. Simplicity enabled a computer company to connect with mass culture on a deep, emotional level, when Jobs himself was not exactly Oprah (even if he also made people teary-eyed). Jobs brought it home just as fiercely: the complications of a couch, for example. His living room didn't require one. Passion matters -- given that you're likely to spend more time being deeply, truly involved with work that energizes you instead of depletes you -- or makes you want to stab your eyes out with your boss's mont blanc pen. When you can put in real, focused, quality time, you're a lot more efficient and can maybe also have a life. Imagine that. :) * Joe Pulizzi makes this point in his excellent upcoming book Content Inc. Highly recommended. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest that your question is flawed. It insinuates that everyone has one true passion. Some do. Famous people tend to be in this category, so the idea that everybody has one true passion gets overpopularized. Some people have more than one passion. And some people have nothing they are truly passionate about. But that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone can\u2019t find happiness in their career, which is I think the real question you are asking. Sit down and make a few lists. What are you naturally talented at. This can be things you are good at, or things you are *not* good at, but think you will be if you put in a year or three of practice.What do you enjoy. This can be things that truly rev your engine. But, in lieu of that, think about doing something for 8\u201310 hours consistently for 10 years. If that thought doesn\u2019t make you depressed, you can put it on the list.What careers are profitable right now. These can be the obvious (doctor, lawyer, engineer), but also can be specific to the current or local economy. If you like languages, you might try picking up Arabic. If you live in the Gulf Coast, you might think about (re-)construction work. Don\u2019t put things that are only lucrative for the top fraction (mobile app development, pro sports, grammy award winning pop star). You can put those things on other lists.What work is useful to your community. The greatest flaw with the trope about finding your passion is that it\u2019s essentially narcissistic. We are social animals. Most of us measure our value in large part in whether other people find us valuable. Also, in a practical way, businesses need to be client-focused. And you are more likely to win at interviews if you are used to thinking about what value you bring to the person hiring you.The second list there is closest to \u201cyour passion\u201d. But, the point of this exercise is to give a nod to that, but try to break away from it a bit. Look at all four lists and see what comes up most often. If something is on all four, it\u2019s a slam dunk. But, it doesn\u2019t have to be on all four. You can get better at something by raw practice. Don\u2019t let not being good stop you from pursuing something you like, is profitable, and is useful. This is the path of the inspiring story: the Special Olympian, the ADHD Mathematician, the non-native English speaker who became a top lawyer.If you are good at something, make good money at it, and it\u2019s useful to people, you don\u2019t need to love the work to get fulfillment in your career. Pick up a hobby you love. This is the path of many doctors, lawyers and engineers.If you really enjoy something, are good at it, and your customers enjoy it, you can put up with the not making a lot of dough. This is the path of the artist, teacher, and most jobs in the non-profit sector.If you really enjoy something, you\u2019re good at it, and its lucrative, then you can usually find the community that finds it useful. This is the path of many academics and engineers who work in esoteric fields.",

            "answer_text": "If you need to \u201cfind\u201d your passion it\u2019s quite likely you simply don\u2019t have one. Highly creative people are the ones who really need a passion in order to feel alive, and they usually know this as a fact since when they\u2019re kids. They identify quite early in life what drives them, and you can\u2019t really separate them from it. Be it making music, painting, building companies, doing research\u2026 If you don\u2019t have such a burning drive to do something specific, it means that you\u2019ve reached adulthood being exposed to a lot of things and never identified anything that triggered it. Unlikely. At this point, you should do some introspection and find out why you think you should even have it. Are you just following a (very American) cultural stereotype, something someone else told you that you\u2019re supposed to have, based on nothing but motivational speaking? Most people seem to find a feeling of meaning and happiness in the sense of belonging to a community, in having children, and in helping other people (which is the reason why, as PayScale surveys show every year, the jobs in the healthcare sector are virtually the only ones where >80% workers state they think their job is meaningful to the world).Try volunteering and working for something community-based, and see if your feeling of lacking something (that you think is \u201ca passion\u201d) decreases or not. Also, I recommend reading the book So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You. It makes the case, supporting it with logic and evidence, that what most people call \u201cpassion\u201d is actually just something they\u2019ve become masters at. Mastery makes you love what you do, because it makes you feel competent, needed, and in control.But maybe saying \u201cwork seriously on something complex for 10 years and you\u2019ll have a passion\u201d is a less marketable concept to the masses than suggesting them they\u2019ll find one under a rock while they\u2019re hiking\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "If someone had asked me four years ago on pursuing my passion, I would have said blogging/YouTubing etc and if that question had been asked six years ago I would have gone blank not knowing what a passion is. When I was a little girl, I would day-dream and sketch abstract things. Then I discovered books and immersed myself into the world of stories. Somewhere along the way I lost my love for reading and got distracted in other teenage stuff. At 19 I discovered YouTube, watched and learned great things. It\u2019s through YouTube I realised how each one of us longs for an outlet of their creative expression. I created my website and started blogging. 2016; a booming time for fashion bloggers/YouTubers. I would write blogs on my style and post perfectly curated fashion photos. Being an economics graduate, I tried merging finance with fashion aka minimalism Although people loved reading my blogs, I failed miserably in that field. I also didn\u2019t have a regular job for me to afford new clothes and makeup. I couldn\u2019t do what was needed to become successful in that area; consistency that is. I was not consistent and not doing enough for me to be able to start earning from a blog. Then I switched towards YouTube and it was not at all fun. Filming and editing a single video would take me minimum of 6 to 7 days. I have to admit that receiving positive feedback and the impact it started making on my confidence levels pushed me to keep going. Bottom line is that my YouTube channel has also stalled and I have probably failed to make a mark on that outlet as well. Both of these experiences have taught me great lessons about pursuing our passions. Sometimes we confuse passion with the need to get validation to overcompensate for our insecurities. However, there are great benefits with trying different things even just for the sake of getting a kick of validation or money. With trying different things we not only realise about our strengths and weaknesses but also about our \u201cWHY\u201d Knowing our \u201cWhy\u201d is utterly important in knowing of our passions. Our \u201cWhy\u201d is what pushes us after failing a hundredth time. If your \u201cWhy\u201d is not powerful enough, you will give up the pursuit of it. Over the years I have given up many things but the only thing I refuse to give up ever is to write and inspire. I believe I might have found my purpose :) My Take: Do anything and everything, your passion will arrive knocking on your door ",

            "answer_text": "You don't have one. Passion is developed, not found. At age 14, I decided to be an industrial designer. 7 years later, 2 years into my industrial design program, I switched to biophysics. 2 years after that, I was an intern in hospital administration. I had passion for industrial design. I thought it was really cool, and I thought I could spend forever doing it. I still like design, but I don't have passion for it anymore. I don't want to work in that field. If I was relying on passion, I would probably be stuck in a low-paying internship or a job I didn't enjoy very much. And my passion would have been squashed. But my passion has grown in a different field. And I picked healthcare administration because of skills that were stronger - I'm better at math and analytical thinking than I am at design. I found the problems more interesting and rewarding. But I didn't pick healthcare because of passion, not at all. I think passion is emotional, and thus unreliable. Passion will come and go, but is more likely to be present when you're doing something you're skilled at and that you find interesting. I work as an analyst in healthcare - it's not a sexy job, but I'm really excited about it. I find my work interesting. At times, I feel passion for it. But it's nearly impossible to find a job or career that you will be passionate about 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. Passion is also not immediate. I developed my passion for healthcare (and it is transient, not permanent) over time, by volunteering, interning, reading, working, and researching the field. I didn't wake up one day in my undergrad and realize I had passion. It came with time. I could develop passion for anything. There are plenty of fields you could develop passion for, too. But more important is to develop skill and expertise. When you start to have success, you'll find you have more passion. I have the most passion for my job on the days that I'm kicking ass and delivering really useful information to administration or to physicians. I feel like what I'm doing is important, and I derive pride from that. But on a slow day, or on a day where I'm struggling, I have little to no passion for my work. If I was relying on passion, I'd be a leaf tossed about in the wind, with no roots or permanence anywhere. Chasing passion isn't a good way to live life, whether that's in jobs or in relationships. It comes and goes. Enjoy it when it shows up. You'll never know what you want without gaining experience and doing practice. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with finding your passion is that multiple layers of institutions that have worked against you to actually find it. These include: your parents, often whom want you to become themselves, or achieve the goals that they themselves could not achieveyour schools, often whom want you to become a factory worker or corporate droneyour government, often whom wants you to become whatever gives them the most in tax-dollarsyour friends, often whom wants you to become follow whatever they dothe media, often whom want to you to travel the world and \u201cfind yourself\u201d without any regard to money, opportunity cost, or family obligationsTo strip out all this, you need to go back to your primal needs. Humans are governed by three primary needs: self-esteemindependencelove / connectionWe each all crave a bit of each of these. And in fact we each struggle balancing these needs as we develop in our lives. But each of us tend towards differing points along the circle.  Each area represents a different way to gain acceptance within our society. For instance, all societies and cultures evolved to preserve their survival by building up a status quo and having everyone adhere to it. This is linked to self-esteem, since self-esteem is only gained when we break through guideposts set up by our society. Societies also need to ensure we have independent thinkers. People whom are seeking out new ways to do things, in case the environment changes rapidly which threatens our survival. Rebels that can push us to think outside the status quo. This is linked to truth. Societies also need people to stick together. People who can act as the glue to maintain solidarity. People whom can keep everyone working together healthily and happily. This is linked to connection. We can see this most clearly in families, which act as mini-communities in today\u2019s modern world. Here are some tendencies that persist across cultures around the world (note: sibling studies are hopelessly controversial so I won\u2019t dwell on absolutes - these are just rough tendencies): First-borns tend towards self-esteem (#1). They gain most satisfaction when they are gaining attention, money, fame, or status. They struggle to connect with others based on love or based on truth. They are adept at working within the boundaries set up within their environment. This means working up corporate hierarchies and become managers, grinding through medical school to be a doctor, etc, and then earning the degrees / certifications that give them prestige.Middle children tend towards truth (#2). These folks tend to very strong at people-skills, negotiating, and listening. Unlike first borns, they tend to be highly attuned to their environment. They question their environment rather than work within it, and thereby tend to be more truth-seeking. They are better at learning languages, studying cultures. They also tend towards more individualistic pursuits - academics, repairmen, artists, etc. Truth is what makes them happy.Youngest children tend towards connection (#3). These folks tend to be strong at understanding their own emotions and discerning others\u2019. They gain satisfaction from making others feel better and establish emotional connections with others. They gain satisfaction by strengthen the linkages within their community. Passions linked to this range from acting to comedy to HR to psychology to nursing.There are multiple types of exceptions. Absent parents can create distortions. Sickness in the family can also distort things. And single children tend to have a mix of all of these. But even they tend to focus on one area for their passion. To understand your passion, you need to understand what\u2019s your driver. Once you find your driver, you\u2019re halfway there.

            "answer_text": "The depth of this question is something that people spend far too little time uncovering and understanding. The majority of people in North America do the exact same thing every day for 30 plus years until they retire, and then by that time their health has deteriorated, their savings have dwindled, and they are too miserable to enjoy the life they thought they would. The reason for this is that they resigned themselves to a career that simply paid the bills but did not fulfill them mentally, physically or spiritually. In fact, it actually did the opposite and had an adverse effect on their physiology and well-being. I have seen people who absolutely love their job and find happiness in the smallest nuances it brings, but then I have seen the opposite where they dread Monday morning and just wait for the weekend. Which one are you? Regardless of what you may have been conditioned to think, each and every person has unique and special talents that this world needs and requires. What are your God-given talents\u2026and are you using them in your career or day-to-day endeavors? No two people are alike and you have been carefully created to bring something extremely valuable to this material existence. If you keep an open mind and be aware of your surroundings, you will notice the diverse and unique skills of the human race. We have doctors, lawyers, caregivers, scientists, teachers, sales professionals, athletes, tradesman, entrepreneurs, specialists, and more. You have been specifically called to tap into your inherent abilities so you can fulfill your obligation to society. Consider these questions: What are you good at? What things do people come to you for guidance about? In what areas are you considered to be an expert? If you haven\u2019t already discovered this and feel like you are drifting on open water then I suggest you pay close attention to the following two points. The first one is to ask your friends and the people around you to tell you what they feel you are good at. What do you do well? How would they define you? What skills do they see in you? The people who have known you for many years can see things that you cannot. These people will be honest and transparent about your talents. Also consider: What are you passionate about? What brings out the fire in you? When do you feel most alive? It is so evident when you see people talk about a subject they really enjoy speaking about. They light up and have this energy that is contagious and infectious. It elevates the atmosphere in the room. Some of the best ideas come from people that pursue their passion and take the time to hone it every day. Passion means wanting to learn more about that discipline or topic, and wanting to be a pioneer in that field and really become an expert. You should never stop educating yourself and you should prophesize about it wherever possible. Passion is not something that you can teach or learn in a class. It is inherent in you and has a deep foundation within your inner being. ",

            "answer_text": "One important question before I answer this question- Why should you find a passion when you don't have any? Having passion is not the best way of life. Passion gives you high expectations which are generally followed by a life long headache of frustration. It gives you dedication and madness towards one particular goal in life, and then in the pursuit, you ignore every other aspect of life.  After spending years towards your passion and ignoring everything else, there are three options- Either you will fail, succeed, or lie somewhere in between. Only success can justify your efforts and make you happy. But the probability of success is not too high. Thus most probably you will end up regretting the beautiful life you left behind. And if you have a passion but ignore it, you will still end up regretting all life. Passion is a two sided coin, where both the sides may result in loss for a person. The sleepless nights, being busy in crucial times of loved ones, missing the beautiful moments of fun and love with spouse, ignoring the love of kids and parents etc are all non refundable capital expenses.  Let's talk about success now! Even if you manage to unlock the doors of success, you will still enter into a beautiful yet empty room, where you most probably won't know what to do next? The feeling of achievement may be subsided very soon, supressed by the years of efforts and sacrifices. Ultimately you will realise that- \u201cThe destination is a point while the journey is life\u201d  I am not against following your passion. If you are passionate about something, your life revolves around your passion, you shouldn't avoid it. But why search for it going out of the way? A simple undisturbed life is a gift of God, it is the way we are born to live, try and seek happiness in it. There is so much to life- Spend time with parents, siblings, cousins.Eat good food, sleep well, keep yourself fit.Enjoy the different weathers, festivals.See closely your children growing up, play with them, teach them.Enjoy an intimate relationship with your life partner, travel together, spend more time together.Save and buy gifts for your loved ones, surprise them, make them happy.Enjoy small achievements like salary increment, bagging a big order in business, first car, own house etc.Spend hours with friends chatting, joking and laughing.Relax yourself on a holiday, lie down on bed, watch TV, sip tea.Help people and animals, feel important and good about yourself.Set small achievable goals, work for them and enjoy the success. Finally answering the question, \u201cHow can I find my passion?\u201d- Passion is not a goal or a product which you can search outside. It is an instinct, an internal drive, craziness towards something which is automatically generated at the back of your mind.Sometimes we are born with a talent or passion for something and sometimes we may realise our passion during the course of life.If you forcefully create a passion for something by seeing others succeeding in a field, your chances of working with dedication in long run fall along along with the chances of success.Though you can always create manageable goals, followed by hard work and minimum expectations.  This is my perspective towards this topic. Though it may sound a bit pessimistic but from my experience it appears to be a more practical way of life. Rest is your choice. Best of luck :) Thanks for A2A Prachita Bakliwal. ",

            "answer_text": "Ways To Find Your Life's Passion And A Career For Success By Love Droid ,Love Droid \\U0001f60d&nbsp; I grew up in Siberia where my dad was a political journalist. He taught me to question everything around me and to take nothing at face value. My mom was a nonconformist by nature, best expressed by the fact that, if she wanted something, there was no stopping her. It didn\u2019t matter how the system worked or what people around her thought or did. She set her own rules. These two traits\u200a\u2014\u200aquestioning everything and being unafraid to go after what I want\u200a\u2014\u200adefined who I am. By the time I moved to the US when I was 16, I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to accept an average 9-to-5 as a career. My time had to be spend on something big, all encompassing and long term and, most importantly, something I would be really passionate about and could really get behind. I set out for Cornell University determined to find my passion. In college I moved quickly from one subject to the next looking for my passion, taking classes ranging from psychology to computer science, neuroscience, fine art and finally film. Although learning was always fun, I just couldn\u2019t get sufficiently motivated by academic goals set in that artificial environment. This led me to leave Cornell only two classes short of graduation. I later found that solving real problems and building something around opportunities I discover is what I\u2019m truly motivated by. Today, I\u2019m fortunate to say that I have, in fact, found my passion and am doing what I love\u200a\u2014\u200abuilding a startup around a set of problems that I believe need solving. In the meantime, I continue to observe people of all ages around me struggle with finding a job they love. In looking at my own path of getting to do what I love, I\u2019m observing four main lessons. 1. When You Know It\u2019s Not Working, Quit Fast Many people hate their jobs and know that they want to do something different, but stay in their hated jobs for a long time nonetheless. Their main reason for not leaving is that they haven\u2019t actually figured out what it is that they want to do. This thinking is flawed because you won\u2019t learn or discover your ideal career or job by sitting around and thinking about it. If the current situation isn\u2019t working, you need to find something else. What happens when you leave even without knowing what you will do next is that, suddenly, figuring out your next steps becomes urgent. That urgency may be a bit uncomfortable, but it can also be incredibly powerful because it frees you up to invest all of your energy into finding the next thing. Finding the next thing goes from optional to required. I personally have left several jobs prematurely, not only not knowing what I will do next, but also exited with no savings to see me through the period of not working. The very last job I left was a startup where I found myself wanting to do a lot more and the company not really needing what I wanted to give. I was at this startup for about nine months and found myself in a position where it felt that I was simply exchanging my time for money. Frustrated, I tried giving feedback to the management and eventually gave notice without much planning. To my surprise, I was offered two weeks of severance, which were much-much needed since I had no savings to hold me over. In all cases, I found that leaving was the right thing as it forced me to keep searching for my next step with urgency and to eventually found the company I now love building. 2. Follow Your Curiosity Even though you may not have a clear vision for your career, you are probably curious about things which may or may not be obvious to you. It\u2019s important to follow your curiosity and uncover your less obvious interests. The reason it\u2019s important is that those interests tap into your unique motivations that separate you from others. Pursuing them sets you on the path of unlocking who you are and your creativity. Frequently, these will be things that do not appear pragmatic and sometimes may seem downright frivolous. A classic example is Steve Jobs\u2019 curiosity for typefaces which led him to attend a seemingly useless class on typography and to develop his design sensibility. Later, this sensibility became an essential part of Apple computers and Apple\u2019s core differentiator in the marketplace. A good way to tune into these interests is to ask yourself what you would do if you had a billion dollars. By my third year of college, I looked through Cornell\u2019s entire giant catalog and couldn\u2019t get excited about any of the classes in it. I had sampled many of the disciplines and felt that I was at a dead end. Frustrated, I finally pushed myself to think about what I would be interested in doing if money were of no concern. To my surprise, that led me to fantasize about drawing and painting. I also realized that I perceived both of these disciplines as forbidden. I believed that my parents would disapprove and that it would be a highly impractical area of study to pursue. Yet, I also realized that I was genuinely excited about fine art and took the plunge which became an important stepping stone in my path. 3. Don\u2019t Make Money Your Primary Consideration My first startup was in New York City. At the time, I had college loans and limited income from freelancing as a video editor, and I lived with my dad and stepmom in New Jersey. One of the partners of my startup invested a small amount of money into the company\u200a\u2014\u200ajust enough to do the basics, such as open a small office in Manhattan. Commuting from my parents\u2019 house was a pain, so I brought in a sleeping bag to our office, got a gym membership and would often stay at the office overnight. It was not ideal, but alternatives, such as spending my time on making money instead of working on the startup, didn\u2019t make sense to me. If you\u2019re looking to spend your life doing something you love, the best way to start is to treat financial concerns as secondary. If the practicality of what you do and how much money you earn are your primary criteria you will instantly limit your options to what\u2019s predictable and getting to do what you love will be tough. On the other hand, if you allow yourself to pursue your curiosity, you will find yourself in the position of power and, eventually, in the position to earn money on your terms. Connecting to your unique interests and motivations and coming into your own authentic self, gives you power in your chosen discipline that others can\u2019t claim. The reason for this is the unique fit of these interests to who you are. For others, what you choose to do may seem like a huge chore, but for you it won\u2019t even feel like work. When your work fits who you are so well, you stand out as being uniquely capable and uniquely powerful. And the better you get at expressing yourself through your work, the higher your earning potential will be in that capacity. 4. Don\u2019t Set An Artificial Ceiling For Yourself Your professional ceiling is set by you. At some point in the past, I hired a designer and didn\u2019t give her an official title. When I started receiving email from her I noticed that she added the word \u201cJunior\u201d to her designer title. I found that quite surprising since that title had never been discussed. For her, this was a way to limit the amount of responsibility she took on, as well as the expectations others would have of her. Since then, I\u2019ve seen many examples of how people define their own ceilings and avoid responsibility and growth. If you do so by choice, I respect it. On the other hand, if you want more growth, then don\u2019t hide behind the belief that someone else needs to empower you to do what you want to do. ",

            "answer_text": "How to discover your passion throughout everyday life? Here are a few suggestions: 1. Question Yourself: ask yourself what you love to do? Do you have a side interest or something you loved doing as a kid? If there's as of now something you love doing, you're on the ball. Presently you simply need to look into the conceivable outcomes of bringing in cash from it. 2. Discover What You Spend Hours Reading About For myself, when I get energetic about something, I'll read about it for a considerable length of time. I'll purchase books and magazines. I'll go through days on the Internet discovering more. There might be a couple of possible results here for you \u2026 and every one of them is conceivable career ideas. Try to investigate and plan accordingly. 3. Conceptualize: Nothing rings a bell immediately? All things considered, get out a piece of paper, and begin recording thoughts. Anything that rings a bell, record it. 4. Make a few inquiries, and Surf for Possibilities Approach others for thoughts. See what others have found as their interests. Look everywhere throughout the Internet for thoughts. The more prospects you locate, the almost certain your odds of finding your actual energy. 5. Try not to Quit Your Job. If you discover your calling, your energy, don't simply turn in your acquiescence tomorrow. It's ideal to remain in your activity while you're inquiring about the potential outcomes. If you can do your energy as a side activity, and develop the pay for a couple of months or a year, that is far superior. It allows you to develop a few investment funds (and in case you're starting a new business for yourself, you'll need that money hold) while rehearsing the abilities you need. See beneath for additional. 6. Check out It First It's ideal to test your new thought before hopping into it as a vocation. Do it as a side interest or side occupation from the start, with the goal that you can check whether it's your actual calling. You might be energetic about it for a couple of days, however where things become real is whether you're enthusiastic about it for in any event a couple of months. On the off chance that you breeze through this assessment, you have likely discovered it. 7. Do a thorough Research: Know much about your passion and if possible. At any time, do considerably more further research. Scan all sites likely on the point, and acquire the best parts accessibly. Find others, either in your general neighborhood or on the Internet, who are successful in that particular professional and inquire about the profession. What do they make? What preparation and training did they need? What talents are vital? How could they get their beginning? What proposals do they have? 8. Practice: If you need to be a professional acquire professional skills. Practice more to expertise in your passion, and practice what makes you perfect in a particular work or profession. 9. Never Quit Trying Can't discover your energy from the start? Surrender following a couple of days and you're certain to come up short. Continue attempting, for quite a long time if necessary, and you'll see it in the long run. Hope this helps in finding your passion. ",

            "answer_text": "To find your passion, you should first take a look at your own life and  see if you're already doing something that you love -- but just not  doing it very often. Figuring out what you really love to do and  channeling it in a productive way that turns it into a passion can help  you explore your heart's desires. Here are some of the things you should  ask yourself when you brainstorm what you love to do: What are my goals?What do I do most of the time?What do I keep on trying to do?If I could do one thing for the rest of my life, what would it be?What do I love to do?What would I do, even if I didn't get paid to do it?What makes me feel like nothing else exists?What activity makes me feel completely in my element?Think about what you've always dreamed of doing. This  is different from making a list of all of the things that make you  happy. Here, you'll have to write down all of those things you've always  dreamed about, but haven't done because you don't have the time, the  money, or because they're impractical or even slightly scary. Here are  the questions you should ask yourself as you brainstorm what you've  always dreamed of doing: What is the one thing I have always dreamed about, but never got to do?What did I want to do when I was a child?Do I have an impractical dream that I once abandoned?Is there something I've been afraid to try because it takes me out of my comfort zone?Is there something I've been wanting to do but haven't done because of financial fears?Is there something I've always wanted to do but haven't tried because I've been afraid I'd fail or just not be very good at it?Is there something that someone I know does that thrills me?Create a game plan. Once you've written down the  answers to your questions, you may have a better idea of the type of  things that already interest you or the things that you've always wanted  to try. Now that you have a bit more information, you can create a plan  for finding your passion. Here are some things you can decide to do:Make a goal of trying at least five things on your list. Plug them  into your calendar. Make a plan for actually doing these things as soon  as you can, even if that means within a year, if the activities are more  complicated, like traveling to a foreign country.Make a goal of trying a few completely new things that take you out  of your comfort zone. They don't have to be on your list -- you can just  try a few more things that pique your interest, even if you haven't  necessarily always dreamed of doing them or tried them before.Prioritize your potential passions. Decide which things you'd like  to try first. You can try the ones that sound most intriguing first, or  you can try the most practical ones first.",

            "answer_text": "1) Inventory your talents What are you good at or have a natural aptitude for? Forget about what you\u2019re good at but don\u2019t really like doing much. I\u2019m talking about the things you have a knack for that delight or happily occupy you. Are there things you like to do that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re that good at, that other people have complimented you on? Perhaps you even dismissed or rejected their enthusiasm. After much digging and questioning (I am a passion hound) I recently discovered that one of my coaching clients loves taking pictures. She rarely picks up her camera, as she didn\u2019t think she was any good. I asked her to email me some favorite shots and they were fantastic. She was skeptical at first, but when I convinced her that I knew what I was talking about (I have earned income from my own photography) she could hardly contain her excitement. She finally had \u201cpermission\u201d to fully embrace this pastime that she loves so much. Yet when I had asked about her passions in our first session, she had come up empty. Identifying things you love that you\u2019re good at is a great way to unearth potential passions. Don't be concerned if what you love isn't practical or common (I get very excited about the uncommon). Please note though that you don\u2019t have to be good at something for it to quality as a passion. You don't have to ever earn a penny of income from it either. Talent can simply be a clue. When it comes to your passions, the only thing that matters is that you enjoy them. 2) Pay attention to who makes you annoyed or jealous Are there people doing things that are \u201cfrivolous\u201d who annoy you? Take a closer look at that annoyance. Is the truth behind your annoyance that you really wish you could live so freely, that you didn\u2019t have so many serious responsibilities and could be as \u201cimmature\u201d as they are? After a lifetime of being an overachieving do-what-everyone-expects-of-me student, when I embarked on my Mexican adventure at 33 I wanted to give myself a break and find time to pursue my freshly discovered passions for writing and dancing. Most people thought I was nuts, but my father got the angriest. He told me I was wasting my life and should let him help me set up my own clinic instead. He pounded the kitchen table with his fist, shouting \u201cLife isn\u2019t supposed to be fun! When are you going to grow up like the rest of us?\u201d Thankfully I ignored him, as I did everyone else who tried to discourage me. A few years later, when it was clear that living, writing and dancing in Mexico was one of the best decisions (and career moves) I ever made, my dad sold his business. And moved to Hawaii. To write his first novel. I\u2019m convinced he was largely so upset because he wanted to do what I was doing. At the time, I\u2019m quite sure he didn\u2019t know that. But eventually he figured it out! 3) Think of what you loved to do as a child This is probably the simplest way to unearth what pursuits hold the potential to light up your days. Before the grown-ups get to us with their ideas, most of us know exactly who we are and what would make us happiest. Were you obsessed with horses? Maybe you should head to a dude ranch for your next vacation. Loved finger painting or drawing? Sign up for an art class. Sang at the top of your lungs until people begged you to stop? Think about joining a local choir (or starting your own garage band!) 4) Notice when you lose track of time, or what you hate to stop doing When I work at the clinic seeing a long line-up of sore throats and knees, I watch the clock all day until I\u2019m finally done. Yet when I have a patient in front of me who is depressed or anxious or newly diagnosed with a condition that would benefit from lifestyle change, I often lose my usual urgency and spend a big chunk of time with them. Not surprisingly, my true passion is life and health coaching, where I have the luxury of time with clients and love spending great swaths of time teaching and encouraging. I dance flamenco until my legs or body force me to stop. I also love working on my \"Health and Happiness Expert\" business so much that I have to force myself to stop writing and reading to sleep and eat and play. It\u2019s reverse clock-watching \u2013 I get annoyed as time goes by! What a different world. What would you love to spend hours doing, that you never get enough time to do? That\u2019s a passion, and you probably need to do it more than you are. 5) See your passion hunt as a fun, joyful adventure In my coaching and speaking work I see people putting pressure on themselves to find their passion. I do believe it\u2019s critically important to discover and engage in things that light you up, but it\u2019s just as important to cultivate an un-serious child-like attitude of play, wonder and adventure. When you deliberately open yourself to noticing things you might enjoy doing, don\u2019t be afraid of getting it wrong. It\u2019s all an adventure, you\u2019re learning and growing as you go. Happiness research shows that trying new things increases dopamine levels in the brain, contributing to sustained levels of contentment. So try away! Notice what you love. Notice what makes you feel like a kid. Notice what you long to have more time for. Make time for these things, whatever you can manage, and watch your life start to change. It\u2019s really magical ",

            "answer_text": "I think everyone are passionate about something or the other, but they just simply don\u2019t know it. I suspect you too fall in the same category. So, one needs to know what a passion looks like, feels like! Passion is something that \u201cPulls\u201d you towards it. That is, something that you cannot live without and how much ever you try to get away from it, it simply brings you back and you end up doing more and more of it. For instance, some people are passionate about Music. They listen to songs, they talk about songs, they recommend and share music with a lot of people and they think that those who don\u2019t listen to music are really a strange lot. They find time to listen, talk, discuss, recommend and share music. It has to be a part of their daily routine. Let me also say that Passion is NOT something that you do during your free time. Passion is something that you compels you TO FIND TIME TO DO IT. To figure out what you are passionate about, just watch out what you would like to do, what do you like to talk about all the time, what pulls you into it and immerses you into it, what is that which you keep doing and when you don\u2019t do it, you find that something is missing. You already know the answer, because you already are passionate about something! So just get it. Well, if you tried and didn\u2019t get it, then relax! Maybe your passion has not yet shown itself out. Give it time. It will come to you!! ",

Search high and low Pick absolutely anything that interests you and type that word or phrase into the \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d box on LinkedIn. For instance, let\u2019s say you love basketball.

Review these profiles to discover the professional and educational experience, skills and qualities needed to land various positions related tobasketball and see if any organizations, job functions or groups in these peoples\u2019 profiles catch your eye as potential options for you. Don\u2019t love what you find? Try searching on a different term! Be a joiner You can join groups on LinkedIn related to any career interest that even vaguely appeals to you. Go ahead and explore! If you like cooking, join a group for professional chefs. If you\u2019ve fantasized about starting your own business, join a group for entrepreneurs. Then, if you find yourself really engaged in the content, start contributing to discussions and connecting with other members. Your interest may be an indication that this is a career path you should pursue. On the other hand, if you lose interest after receiving a few updates from a group, then that profession might not be the best choice for you. Connect with passionate people Look around your life for other people who share your passions -- or any passion. Just as you should connect on LinkedIn with people who share your alma mater or a past internship employer, you should also connect with people who share your personal interests or hobbies. Look for people who inspire you in groups and send them a connection request asking for a few words of wisdom. Most passionate people are happy to share their excitement about what they do. Don\u2019t be afraid to fail It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll find your passion just by sitting at your computer. You have to go out in the world and try new things. Do more volunteering, take on part-time work, sign up for a class in something you\u2019ve never studied. Use LinkedIn to discover your passion and find opportunities, and then get out there and take action! Your path is out there, just waiting to be discovered. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cYou have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you\u2019re not passionate enough from the start, you\u2019ll never stick it out.\u201d Steve Jobs The passion you are looking for with every ounce of your being is not found somewhere else in the world. You might look for it from an external source (self-help books, inspirational audios, mentors, billionaires, leaders, friends, etc.) They can tell you their own experiences and how they have found their passion (if they have). They can share with you the path they have taken to find this thing called passion. But none of them can tell you what your passion is. None of them can tell you what you are passionate about. Only you can do that. The only one who can find out what your passion is you.   There is an ancient story where a young man looked for Socrates looking for wisdom. Here\u2019s the account of the story: \u201cA young man asked Socrates, \u201cWill you please teach me all I need to know and all I need to learn to be a success?\u201d Socrates nodded and said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Then he started walking toward the ocean with the young man following in step. Once on the sand, Socrates continued to walk straight into the water. The young man followed. When both were chest deep in the ocean, Socrates placed his hands on the young man\u2019s head and quickly forced it under the water. After about ten seconds, the young man fought his way to the surface and began to gasp for air. Socrates released the boy\u2019s head, turned and walked away. The young man did this three times. He went to Socrates. He asked the same question. Socrates did the same thing and walked away. At the end of the third attempt, the young man ran after Socrates. When he was a few feet from Socrates he shouted, \u201cSocrates, why is it every time I come to you and ask for your help to gain the wisdom and the knowledge on how to be a great success, all you do is take me out in the water and dunk my head?\u201d Socrates turned around, faced the young man, and said, \u201cSon, I have tried three times now to teach you the secret of being a great success. The secret is simple: When you want to succeed as much as you want to breathe, you will be a great success.\u201d I totally agree. Even though Socrates was talking about success, I can say that the message works in finding your passion as well. You know that you have found your passion when you cannot live without it. You know that you have found your passion when you need it like the very air you crave when you are underwater. If you don\u2019t feel the craving for \u201cthis thing\u201d like you crave air for your existence, then you have not yet found your passion.  How do you find your passion? Answer these questions for yourself: \u00b7Is there anything that you do consistently even when you do not have enough time? \u00b7 Do you find ways in your spare time to accommodate \u201cthis thing\u201d? \u00b7Do you lose track of time when you are immersed in \u201cthis thing\u201d? \u00b7Does your heart speeds up when you talk about \u201cthis thing\u201d to your friend or a member of your family? \u00b7Are you internally motivated to do \u201cthis thing\u201d? \u00b7Will you do \u201cthis thing\u201d even if you are not paid a penny? \u00b7Do you enjoy \u201cthis thing\u201d? Do you see \u201cthis thing\u201d as play rather than work? \u00b7Do you get up quickly after a setback? \u00b7Does \u201cthis thing\u201d feeds your soul \u2013 rather than drain your energy? \u00b7Do you want to learn everything about \u201cthis thing\u201d? \u00b7 Do you want to be the best at \u201cthis thing\u201d? \u00b7 Are you no longer interested in distractions like Social Media because you\u2019re always immersed in \u201cyour thing\u201d? \u00b7 Do you take more risks for \u201cthis thing\u201d? \u201cThis thing\u201d implies your passion. If you\u2019ve answered the above questions that means you know with certainty what you are passionate about it. All you have to do next is to make sacrifices so that your passion precedes other activities, so that it becomes a priority, so that you can give it your whole. Jim Rohn said it best: \u201cWhen you know what you want, and want it bad enough, you will find a way to get it.\u201d If you were not able to answer the above questions, then it is time to dig deeper within yourself. Losing track of time If you pay close attention to what you do throughout the day, you will find out which activity has gotten your complete attention. Have you lost track of time when you were preparing a dish? Have you lost track of time when you were leading your team? Have you lost track of time when you were creating some sort of art? Or while writing? Did you lose time when you were negotiating a deal with your clients? Did you lose time when you were writing codes in front of your laptop? Pay close attention. It\u2019s crazy how we lose sight of \u201cthe thing\u201d we love the most by not paying enough attention. If you can\u2019t find something that is making you lose track of time in your recent days, go back. To your teenage years. To your childhood day. Excitement is the key \u201cPassion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you.\u201d Oprah Winfrey Find that thing that excites you. Like a fire that burns from within, when you find this thing, everybody around you can tell that you and this thing has a long-term relationship. And that no one and no force on earth is going to separate the two of you (one being you and the other being your passion) even if they try all their lives. You have a relationship with your passion because it is based on the love you have for each other. This love cannot be explained on paper simply. You either have it or you don\u2019t. I give you a simple example: When I sit down in front of my laptop to write, the feeling I always have is euphoric. I cannot explain it to you. I love it. I feel like if I don\u2019t yet, I would suffocate. That is how I know writing is my passion. Mia Hamm said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t love what you do, you won\u2019t do it with much conviction or passion.\u201d It is the love that creates an enduring excitement. Internal motivation You know you\u2019ve found your passion when you are internally motivated. When something inside of you is the force that is making you do something or chase something relentlessly, you know that you\u2019ve got it. You will do \u201cthis thing\u201d even if you are not paid a penny Doing something because you are going to be paid is completely different from doing something because you cannot think of not doing \u201cthis thing\u201d. You have to ask yourself: Why are you doing this thing or that thing? Is it because you are going to be paid or is it because you want and need to do this thing \u2013 even if you are not paid? If it is the former - then that is not really your passion. Of course, it is great to be paid, but that should not be your primary goal if you are looking for your passion. You become energetic When you find your passion. You can only feel energetic about something when you love it with all your heart, when that thing is the major part of your life and you are extremely happy about it. You do not easily get tired. Because you are doing something that you love. Because you can\u2019t wait to get back to it. Because the energy is coming from within. When something feeds your soul \u2013your energy can never be drained from you. The supply is coming from an endless source. And that is you. Your passion must be at the top in your priority list You cannot really be passionate about something if that thing is found at the middle or the bottom of your lists. You ought to put this thing on the top. If you cannot see this thing as the most important thing that you must pursue, then you do not love it enough. If you do not crave this thing with every fiber of your being, if you do not love it more than the other things you\u2019re chasing, then that means \u201cthat thing\u201d is not really your passion. Here\u2019s what the late Steve Jobs said on the subject: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, keep looking. Don\u2019t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\u2019ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don\u2019t settle.\u201d Now, are you ready to find your passion? I have found out what mine is, what is yours?  (Image Credit - Google Images) Enjoyed this? Join my readers for similar inspirational contents - Banchi Inspirations. ",

            "answer_text": "The word passion is a misnomer. The meaning of the word itself is probably half the reason you haven\u2019t found yours yet. You\u2019re expecting it to be something huge you\u2019ll have incredible feelings for, bigger than anything you\u2019ve ever dreamed of because you know, you\u2019re gonna be so passionate about it! In reality, strong emotions are short-lived, like fireworks. Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory but quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. \u2014 Angela Duckworth That\u2019s why most people who haven\u2019t found their passion yet are having such a hard time finding one because they\u2019re not that obvious. It turns out passions don\u2019t just fall out of the sky already formed like the stork just delivered \u2018em, you have to develop them yourself, following the few simple steps outlined below. Your passion is hiding right under your nose Getting started with finding your passion is as easy as picking up one of the many things you\u2019re already interested in, meaning you like the thing and think you\u2019ll enjoy doing it and getting busy. I mean, you do like something, right? At least you think you do. You\u2019re gonna spend a lot of time wrestling with that one thing to find out how much you really like it. The key is to stop overthinking and just get started. A child does not walk onto a playground and say to herself, \u201cHow do I find fun?\u201d She just goes and has fun. \u2014 Mark Manson Picking your thing is easy. Doing it for any length of time is less so. Your first hurdle is sometimes your last \u201cEnthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare.\u201d \u2014 Angela Duckworth So, you chose a thing, and then you did the thing. Congratulations! Everything has been going great so far, but unfortunately, there will come a time when you hit a setback, slump, or get knocked down. This is the point where you will decide how much you really like your thing. It\u2019s okay if you wanna give up your thing and choose another one. There\u2019s a chance you might not find your thing on your first or even second try, and that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re making progress either way, and I\u2019m proud of you, kiddo! But on the other hand, maybe you loveyour thing, and you just can\u2019t wait to wake up from the total knockout you were just dealt to keep at it. Good for you. You\u2019ve got some of that true grit, champ. Some of that good old fashioned pluckiness. The ability to come back the next day and do it all again is really going to help you develop your passion. Stuck in the middle with you Choosing to stick with your thing despite a setback is admirable, and it\u2019s what I like to see, but it\u2019s no time to rest on your laurels. Things aren\u2019t going to get easier for a while, in fact, this is the point where you might feel like you\u2019re treading water. If you\u2019re going to get anywhere with this thing of yours, you\u2019re gonna have to get better at it. That\u2019s where deliberate practice comes into play. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t bore you with the details now, you should be looking into it on your own time anyway, I\u2019m just outlining your overall path! What, do you want me to do your laundry and run your baths for you too? At this point, you just have to buckle up, or down, or whatever way floats your boat (who am I to judge?), and do the practice that must be done if you\u2019re serious about finding your passion. This is the part of your story where you start getting really good at doing your thing. And then you\u2019re gonna need a purpose \u201cAt its core, the idea of purpose is the idea that what we do matters to people other than ourselves.\u201d \u2014 Angela Duckworth Okay, so listen, you picked a thing, you liked it, you got much better at it, and now you\u2019re sitting there feeling pretty good about yourself, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s great and all, but you\u2019re not making any money yet. And that\u2019s a problem if you wanna pay your bills. I mean, you might not wanna pay your bills, but your bills are gonna wanna get paid! So, what can we do about that? As an example, let\u2019s say your thing is art. Who cares? Nobody gives a heckin\u2019 hoot. Even if you\u2019re good at making it, it doesn\u2019t always generate enough money to live on. People will see your fan art, or worse, your original works, and they\u2019ll be like \u201ccool, but what can you do for me?\u201d And then you realize, you have to be providing a service people actually need in order for them to wanna pay you. Your passion needs to serve others. Light-bulb moment, ah-ha! So you shift gears and use the God-given talent that was floated down to you by tiny naked cherubs on a pillow of clouds that you definitely didn\u2019t work very hard for at all to make editorial illustrations, because people need those, and now you\u2019re getting paid. Also, a purpose might help keep you motivated or contribute to the overall enjoyment of your work and life in some meaningful way or some junk. But that\u2019s probably all secondary to making a few greenbacks. Now that\u2019s what I call finding your passion! To recap, it\u2019s almost impossible to not find your passion, all you have to do is: Pick an interest and dive into it to find out if you really like itPersevere and improve your skills through deliberate practiceFind a purpose AKA a reason for people to pay you for itProfitWhich step of the journey are you on?

            "answer_text": " I\u2019m providing you exact steps you need to take to figure out what you should do with your life. I will also include a set of questions (via our test or quiz) you can ask yourself that will help you gain more clarity. Step 1 \u2013 Keep It Simple & Have Fun First and foremost, don\u2019t let this overwhelm you. All too often people feel stressed out about figuring out what they should do with their life that it becomes this heavy burden that it actually detours you from finding your passion in life. Take a deep breath. Relax. Have fun. And let it come through you naturally. Step 2 \u2013 Follow Your Excitement With all of the self improvement and new age rhetoric you hear out there about \u201cfollowing your passion\u201d, what most people don\u2019t talk about are the actual mechanics of how this all works. Rather than thinking of some big project or career (which in actuality is jumping too far ahead), you need to focus on small steps that you can immediately take that will set up a scenario for one of the X-Factors that I teach: synchronicity. It\u2019s through synchronicity that will allow the pieces of the puzzle to all start to come together. When you look at the story of any successful person, you will see that it was some small tinkering, a book, a class, or something that seemed \u201cinsignificant\u201d that led to their ultimate success. Steve Jobs took a calligraphy class that later on inspired him to start Apple. So what you need to do is ask yourself this question: What excites me right now? Then do that and when that is over follow your next excitement and then the next one and so on. Have fun and play like a little child. Have you ever seen kids play with one toy to the next? A child will be fully present in the moment playing their game until they are done with it and then will quickly move on to the next thing without even thinking about it. Kids are naturally in tune with what excites them. You need to rekindle that relationship with your inner child and play with one thing to the next and see what comes up for you along the way. I\u2019ll show you how this worked in my life and took me from a depressed overweight teenager to a highly successful Madison Ave media executive in just a moment. Step 3 \u2013 Focus On A Theme Once you have found something that excites you, then focus on that theme: SportsMusicArtBusinessTravelPhilanthropyTeachingEtc\u2026 Whatever it is that excites you, it will be part of an overarching theme that you can connect it with that will help you learn how to discover your passion in life. The truth is that many of you are probably already doing something that is your passion but because of how society defines a \u201ccareer,\u201d you have (without knowing it) discounted it not realizing that you already found it but have minimized it thinking that \u201cThere is no way I could make money from doing this.\u201d You would be amazed at how much your subconscious rules your life without even knowing it. As someone who spent over ten years in advertising, trust me, your mind can be controlled a lot easier than you think. Work vs Hobby As you begin this process, it\u2019s important to pay attention if any of these things feel more like your work or if they are a hobby. There is nothing wrong with creating your work life around your hobby. I have a friend who loves to surf. That is all he wants to do. He is not interested in becoming a professional or getting sponsored or anything like that. He wants to surf every day and do it on his terms. So he moved down to Costa Rica, got a job as a waiter (at night time) so that he can surf all day. He lives a very simple life but is extremely happy. In his world, he is successful. This is why it is important that you have a clear understanding of what success means to you. Do not listen to what others define as being successful, listen your heart and do what works for you. If that means making a lot of money and working a high paying corporate job then so be it. But make sure it\u2019s true for you. How To Find Your Passion Test Break out a piece of paper and pen (or open up a Word doc) and answer these questions: 1. What can you talk about all day without getting tired of it? 2. What do you love to learn about? 3. What products or services really excite you? 4. Who do you admire and why? 5. What do you want to accomplish before you die? 6. Who are your top three favorite companies? What do you love about them? 7. What problems are you good at solving? After answering these questions, you should notice a theme. That theme should tell you what you are passionate about. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two routes to accomplish this, finding your passion either within your full-time occupation or as a hobby/outside of work activity. I am going to go a different route on this answer than most other answers though and argue this: Finding your passion within work is not only nearly impossible, it is a dangerous concept. Finding your \u201cburning passion\u201d within a full-time occupation is, frankly, a concept many of us were \u201csold\u201d as kids that is not very realistic. That is not to say it cannot be done, many people out there really like their jobs (I do, personally), but for most people works is a means to an end. And that is fine. To continually seek a job you are completely \u201cpassionate\u201d about puts you in a precarious situation of never being satisfied with your work situation. Put bluntly, work is \u201cwork.\u201d Even within \u201cdream\u201d jobs, or in roles that someone is really passionate about, there is a lot of other not-at-all passionate work that needs to get done. Sending emails, holding meetings, updating websites, traveling/commuting, writing when you don\u2019t want to, etc. Take a moment to think of your dream job. I can guarantee there are some parts of that job that will be monotonous, will separate you physically or mentally from people you care about, or will otherwise bore you. If you happen to find a job that you like, have a boss that treats you well (or are a boss that is respected by your employees), and you work with people you enjoy being around you should be thankful. Be passionate in certain aspects of your job and for those other parts be thankful you are in a good situation.  The Other Route to Burning Passion The easier of the two options I mentioned above is to be passionate about a hobby or some other activity you are engaged in outside of work. Hopefully you can find a job that gives you time to explore this marvelous side of life - free time. Get into trail running, kayaking, bird watching, trying out new restaurants, singing, dancing, playing the guitar (alone or in a band), etc. You name it. There are literally millions of activities out there, find something you are passionate about! Not only will it be a fulfilling part of your life, in many cases that happiness and fulfillment will give you more energy to perform well at whatever you do for work. ",

            "answer_text": "This is hard to answer without knowing anything about the context. I'll answer from passion for pleasure . You may mean as far as a career but I'm the wrong guy for that one. I'll let you know when I have the answer in my own life lol. First and formost, try as many experiences as you can that you have never done. They don't even have to cost money. One of my passions is hiking which starts as just waking :) keep trying until one or two stand out as something you may want to try again. This brings me to my second core belief; Don't try new things looking for a passion. Try them to be in the moment and enjoy or dislike what you are doing. If you have a feeling of maybe you want to try it again, great. If not, no worries and on to the next thing. Starting with a goal of finding passion is too much pressure, you won't enjoy anything because you will feel like you aren't doing it right, leading to anxiety. ( Trust when I say, I found this the hard way) Lastly, you create passion. If you try a guitar and you get that release of dopamine, that's your brain telling you \u201check yeah this is scratching my itch i want more\u201d then allow yourself to be excited to do it again. Have pleasure in thinking about what the next step of this budding passion might be. To me that is as much fun as the activity. Before my daughter was born, I would try and find a tough interesting trail for my dog and I to hike/camp solo. I had just as much fun researching the trails and planning what gear is needed (I carry everything for 5 days on my back and the dogo used to carry 20 lbs of her own stuff), as I did the hike itself. In the end, even if you never find your idea of passion, you will have a wealth of experiences that you enjoyed on the way. Hope that helped and if not, that's cool to. It was beneficial to remind myself of the above. Peace Mike ",

            "answer_text": "It's pretty easy.  What do you do as soon as you get done with school/work (assuming you've not yet constructed your education/employment around your passion)?  What you talk about to your friends, perhaps incessantly?  What do you know more about that just about anyone you know?  After food and shelter, on what do you spend most of your money? That's your passion. I think you might have intended to ask \"How do I go about feeling passionate about something?\".  As best I can tell, you start on a new topic and have a few small initial successes, and that's enough to propel you forward to spend a bit more time with it.  If it comes easily or you're particularly intrigued then you reach a tipping point where you go into a \"hyperfocus\" mode where you spend a significant part of your waking hours thinking about the topic.  The initial level of talent you bring to the table is (nearly) irrelevant; most people don't spend 1000 hours getting good at something, much less 10000 hours.   The trick, if there is one, is the ability to focus.  I haven't owned a television in 15 years and I'm not on facebook.  My partner has her own passions and cheerfully supports mine.  And there's a lot of social status timesinks that I just don't bother with.  So if I need three or four hours in an evening to just sit and think about a problem, I have my life arranged so I can do that. Here's what you should take away from this:  thinking about \"passion\" as something you need to unearth is just as silly as thinking there is exactly one \"right person\" for you to spend your life with.  If you stop searching and instead cultivate your capacity to be passionate then the world will be filled with interesting problems just waiting for you to solve them.  You might latch on to one of those problems exclusively or you might spend a few years on one and pick up another.  You'll never be bored, and you'll rarely have a day when you don't know what you should be working on. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m answering this because the subject is near and dear to my heart as an intern for a cutting edge career exploration startup called PathSource. While your passion may seem elusive, one of the most valuable things you can do in your passion search is to stay curious. Our iOS app helps young adults pick the career that best fits their interests and ideal salary through assessments. If you\u2019ve found something you are passionate about, stick with it! Now is the time to delve deeper, learn more, and develop you skills. However it is very rare that people find their passion on the first try. The process of finding your passion is by no means a simple or linear and many struggle with this question often. While it might be easier said than done, embrace ambiguity! If you haven\u2019t found your passion just yet, continue exploring. The best thing you could do is to expose yourself to as many experiences and resources as possible. You can do this through starting your own projects, taking on volunteer or internship opportunities, talking with professionals in a particular field, or using a career exploration app like PathSource. The point is, that no one can take on the quest alone. It might take a few tries and it might take way more than you ever anticipated. What\u2019s great about this time of exploration is that you get to experience what your passion really entails. Don\u2019t be afraid to seek out these resources and ask questions, the easiest way to truly understand what you\u2019re getting into is to hear directly from people doing what you are aspiring to do. For some, it\u2019s about finding a balance between their passion and practicality. There are ways to still pursue a career integrating your passion while incorporating additional skills as Kyle Poehling found. Kyle works at a company named Notion Music where he works as a Marketing & Communications Manager. The responsibilities of his job ranges from web design to ad design. As he discovered, \u201cDay jobs involving music are about as rare as they come. So when I saw the window open up, it was a no brainer.\u201d His job is still very much music focused, but allows him to employ other skills in order to create a career he is passionate about: \u201cAs a musician, you work really hard to try to figure out how to make your craft be your career. And this is certainly a marriage of that.\u201d For some individuals, it means not being afraid to make a change. In his interview, Zach, an Analyst for Google+ describes the journey he took to find the career he was passionate about: \u201cI always knew I wanted to have more of a business focus but I did not know what I wanted to do in college.\u201d What he initially thought he was passionate about did not turn out to be a good fit, \u201cI did a real estate internship and wasn\u2019t too crazy about it, I took a job in finance in New York after graduating and absolutely hated it and I hated the people I worked with, hated the type of work.\u201d After those negative experiences, he felt that he needed to make a change and come out to California and explore the tech scene. While he didn\u2019t know exactly why, he felt that \u201cculturally that\u2019s where [he] felt like [he] belonged.\u201d At the end of the day Zach believes, it\u2019s about being honest with yourself, \u201cSome advice I\u2019d give people if they want a job like mine, you just have to be persistent and you have to know what you want and why you want it.\u201d While the road might be daunting or unclear, Zach assures that instinct never fails, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much about the long term, the perfect job for now. Just follow what you\u2019re interested in and tell people why that\u2019s what you want to do now and everything will fall into place after that.\u201d Still, there are some who have known their passion from the beginning. In this interview, Maisha describes how working as an attorney is something she\u2019s always wanted to do after she fell in love with the idea in middle school. She went to college and later to law school and passed the bar exam to become a licensed attorney. After achieving her goal, she was ready to start working. She said for her, \u201cIt was really about trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I\u2019ve always been a community organizer/activist and always loved working with people, so nonprofit was good for me.\u201d Staying true to herself and her passion is what drives her and others in her profession: \u201cWhat I know now is that there are a lot of passionate attorneys that work in nonprofit work. Attorneys that just want to give back to the community and do the work because they have passion in their heart not because of the money they get paid.\u201d It is easy to be passionate about something when it is going well. By no means does \u201cpassion\u201d equate with effortlessness. While your passion might play into your strengths, finding your passion is only half the battle. The real work is maintaining it. Maintaining your hunger for your passion and translating it to a career is no easy feat. At times, you may find disillusionment in the realities of your passion. Whether you find it to be too time consuming or difficult or boring from time to time, the real test is to not abandon your passion when the going gets tough. A professor gave me great advice that I will never forget: \u201cYou can teach skills, but you can\u2019t teach attitude.\u201d At the end of the day, you have to find something that is both fulfilling and challenging, something that you are willing to work through when obstacles present themselves.

            "answer_text": "Dear, Your passion?Your interests?Sure? Let's first understand what I call as my passion or my interest, is it really mine? The world is full of people who pursued what they call as their \u2018interest\u2019, or their \u2018hobby\u2019, or even their \u2018love\u2019, and kept feeling as frustrated as you probably do. See, the influences that others have upon us, we resist them. So, as you are saying, your parents have a certain influence upon you. You want to resist it; you don\u2019t feel comfortable with it. There is a constant feeling that- I am doing something under somebody\u2019s influence or pressure. So, you turn to the mind and then we ask the mind, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d and the mind comes up with an answer which I call as \u2018my interest\u2019. You say, \u201cI want to pursue my interest.\u201d So, somebody is born in a particular family, living in a particular house, in a particular street. When he is a kid there are many influences upon him. There is the influence of the father who wants him to become a shopkeeper; who wants him to take over the traditional family shop, the business. And then there is the influence of all the elder brothers, the neighbors, and the kids who are living in the vicinity, and they are playing cricket all the time. So, they take this fellow out to play cricket. Now, cricket is something that he acquires from these people, but he starts calling it \u2018my interest\u2019. And the shop is something he gets from his father and he calls it \u2018father\u2019s shop\u2019. Look at this. Where does he get the shop from? The father. And he says, \u201cNo, no, no. I do not want to go to the father\u2019s shop.\u201d  It is the father\u2019s shop. And what does he call his interest in cricket?My passion. You know, these are three levels of influence: \u2013 1. When the influence is superficial, you call it \u2018influence\u2019. 2. When the influence is deep, then you call it \u2018interest\u2019. 3. And when the influence has penetrated the very depth of your mind, then you start calling it \u2018my individuality\u2019. So, the most sick people are those who say that this work is an expression of my individuality. Oh my God! The patient is almost beyond redemption now. What will happen? What will happen is just that you will pursue what you call as your interest only to be dismayed, only to be even more frustrated. A mad man comes and asks, \u201cI have to go to New York. Should I travel vertically up or vertically down?\u201d What would you suggest him? If he is giving you two choices; two options are there and he is asking, \u201cWhat should I choose? Should I fly up or should I dig a tunnel all the way to New York?\u201d What would you recommend him? Recommend him some freshly cut lemon.:) AM To get more clarity on this: http://prashantadvait.com/2015/04/17/what-are-hobbies-and-interests/ http://prashantadvait.com/?s=influence ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in third grade, a man came into the room to demonstrate all the instruments. He was doing this to give us an idea of what they sounded like, in hopes that some kids might want to start learning to play an instrument. When he played the trumpet, I felt like some clarion laser had pierced my heart. I knew, instantly, that this was my instrument. I played and took lessons for the next ten years, but at the end of my first year in college, I made a mistake, and I didn\u2019t preregister for lessons for the next year. When I went to sign up for lessons, they told me I needed to audition again, and I hadn\u2019t prepared an audition piece. I stopped taking lessons, and I stopped playing in any ensembles, and I stopped playing, period. That was the first time I learned how to punish myself by not pursuing my passion. I wasn\u2019t going to make a living playing the trumpet. It was just for fun. So I let it go, and I spent the next forty years, falling further and further into pain and eventually depression, in part because I was doing what I thought others expected me to do, instead of doing what I really wanted to do. There is one thing that gets in the way of finding one\u2019s passion. Unfortunately, that one thing can be very important for our survival. Human beings do so well because we have learned how to cooperate with each other. We can work together, and when we work together, we can do more than any other species on the planet. Human\u2019s ability to cooperate has enabled us to collaborate on turning solutions to problems from ideas into reality. We now cooperate on vast levels, with billions of people working together to create safety and wealth for ourselves. Evolution has played a role in helping us cooperate. It\u2019s probably pretty simple. Any trait that confers a survival advantage will help people who have that trait to survive and bring up their children more successfully. One of these traits is the need to be concerned with others and to fit in with others. This is important because it helps us build the trust necessary to be able to cooperate. So we have evolved to be very concerned about what others think of us. We want to do what other who are important in our lives want us to do, because that way we build up the kind of trust necessary for us to work together. This has become an incredibly strong need in most humans. We care so much what others think of us because our survival depends on it. Finding your passion is an internal process. It requires that we ignore what others want or think of us. We have to pay attention to what we love, which can be almost impossible when our parents and teachers and friends are all telling us what to do, and we want to please them because it is very important to stay in their good graces. For many, finding their passion means doing things that go against the orders or suggestions of their parents and teachers. Parents often want children to do practical things that will earn them a good living, like computer engineering or becoming a lawyer or a doctor. When a child expresses an interest in art or music or dance, parents turn them away, saying that these things can not support a family. They are childish things. Parents will tell their kids that they shouldn\u2019t try to go to college. They can\u2019t afford college. Or that they can\u2019t spend their time doing anything fun, playful, or useless. Children must focus on what their parents tell them, and because we have evolved to care very much about what our parents tell us, because our survival depends on it, many of us are turned away from our passions before they even have a chance. Is it any wonder that so many people don\u2019t know what their passion is? They were never allowed to follow one, and they quickly learned that having a passion was just not something people did. If you wanted to stay connected with family and community, you didn\u2019t rock the boat. You did what you were told. You didn\u2019t do what you wanted to do. After many years of doing this, so many people haven\u2019t a clue what their passion is. They\u2019ve been told all their lives to do as they\u2019re told. How could they possibly know what they want if no one tells them what to do? In fact, doing what they want to do has become very unsafe. If you do something you haven\u2019t been told to do, you might do it wrong. You might make a mistake. You might hurt someone. You might risk being ostracized from the community. To be ostracized from the community, for most of human history, has meant death. Many people have no idea what their passion is because to find it, they have to risk death. I rediscovered the importance of doing what I am passionate about because eventually, I got so sick of doing what I thought was expected of me, that I was in so much pain, I thought it would never end, unless I was dead. The one thing that gave me any relief at all, was playing my horn with others. That was the only thing I could rely on. Later on, I worked music into my recovery and eventually, it became a key means for recovery. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. I was in despair because I was doing what I thought was expected. I came out of despair only when I started doing what I loved to do. If you want to see what I\u2019m up to these days, check out Sonic Sandbox. How do people who have been pushing their passion away for most of their lives find their passion? That takes a lot of work, and oddly enough, teaching people the skills to do that has also become a part of my passion. There is a lot of pain associated with straying from your passion, and it leads many into depression, including me. Music helped me come out of depression, and I realized that what I was doing was a method that anyone could use, along with other therapeutic interventions, to cope with depression and other mental differences. I call it changing thought habits and I\u2019ve written a lot about it here on Quora. I believe this process, good for helping people cope with mental health issues, is also good for helping people find their passion. It provides a way for people to let go of their pervasive thoughts about pleasing others, so they can pay attention to the part of their mind that knows (and always knew) what their passion was, before it was so rudely interrupted by social pressure. If you can free yourself from the pressures of meeting the expectations of others, you can create a mental or spiritual opening inside yourself that will allow you to unlock your passion from the jail you have put it in, many long years ago. This process takes a lot of work; years of work, in fact. It\u2019s not easy. Most people only take this path if they absolutely have to \u2014 if death is pretty much the only other option. Some people are able to find their passion early. Some people create enough freedom or take enough freedom to pursue their passion. Some people never had a choice but to pursue their passion. However, most just drift away from their passion, and when they realize it is missing, it has been gone for so long and has drifted so far away, they despair of ever finding it. Fortunately, the drifting away is a spiritual thing, and if people can gain access to their spiritual side, they will find their passion was there all along. Working to change habits of thought is one way they can find their way back to their passion. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A.It takes time, because we tend to think in terms of school and courses instead of thinking in terms of career and interests. Try first to imagine where you stand. Some of my students, never the majority, wanted to be leaders, and some preferred to work with companions, and some wanted to be left alone. Variable proportions of students every year dream to travel and work abroad or are set to stick around the place where they come from. Some wanted a repetitive job: a friend of mine, highly intelligent, once told me that he had never been as happy as when he had to sort cables by color and thickness. Why? My guess is that he likes above all order. Your passion is not just what you like to work on, it will be also the circumstances, what makes you happy and comfortable, so try to find out about yourself. You probably know what you do not like. If you do not like to read, there is a good chance your passion will not be to write books. But we generally like a lot of things. I suppose you took mechanical engineering because you liked a few things in it. But you also may like going to the movies or cooking or going to the opera. Your passion may be somewhere in the things you like, you just have to distinguish what is a professional and what is a personal passion. I was an oceanographer, but the activity I liked best was the measurements I had to do at a nuclear reactor. Ever since I understood why the sun is hot, I had a passion for the nuclear. Also, some passions sneak on you with time. It never came to my mind that I could be an architect. But over the years and decades, I developed a passion for it. It probably came from my irritation about the places where I lived. Poorly designed, I think. Take your time: it is like a good meal: taste everything. Tell me what feels good! ",

            "answer_text": "Try to find a purpose this way: Each of us sometime heard any definition of motivation. I would say that mainstream media or schools don't provide us by the real concept of motivation that is hidden quite deep. Every time you hear a word \"motivation\", you probably picture a situation when somebody tells you: \"SON! YOU HAVE TO STEP UP AND YOU HAVE TO START WORKING ON YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY!\" and you feel very motivated. You feel that NOW it is the right time to take action. That now it is the right time to start doing something. That now it is the right time to work on becoming a new person.No. That's bullshit. This motivation feels good but it is just an Outer motivation. Most of the people misunderstand what is the real motivation. As I mentioned,outer motivation feels good but it lasts only short period of time and this outer motivation is the one which they describe us. It is like a smell. You open a window and after a while you don't know that something smelt in the room. Everyone wants to be motivated. But they don't realize that they are motivated by others only from OUTSIDE. If you are motivated by something or by somebody that means you are motivated from outside. And if you are motivated from outside, it doesn't last for long time. It feels pretty good but it motivates you, it inspires you to do something only for a short time. Sometimes it lasts only seconds. Let's move on the key of the whole motivation. The key of the whole motivation is Inner motivation. Inner motivation is motivation that lasts LONG TIME. This is the motivation that we need. This is the real motivation that keeps us doing something again and again and it keeps us stuck to these actions. People want to be motivated by others(from outside) because it is easy and as I mentioned it feels good. But what about motivating ourselves to do something again and again? We find it much harder. When someone tells us some \"motivational words\" we feel that our bodies are full of energy. But when we have to motivate ourselves, most of the time we feel tired and bored and here comes the exceptions. Only strong individuals can motivate themselves in the way that they: 1)realize that they have bad thinking - with realizing bad thinking comes realizing of bad habits, 2)by change of thinking comes taking actions, 3)by taking actions comes habits(repeating something makes the action becoming a habit), and at the end comes 4)a new person. One of the biggest realization is that human beings are creatures of habits and creating of habits comes with taking the same kinds of actions again and again. Do you feel good when teachers or parents push you into learning? NO! So why don't you make it happen in another way? After realizing these 4 steps that I mentioned, you realize that it is not that hard. In the first step you need to realize in what way you think about everything that is around you and how you take it. By realizing this, start changing the way you think and by changing thinking you start realizing your purpose of life. Your purpose of everyday life. Your purpose of doing what you do at thepresent moment. Start by simple steps, i.e.: a) you trash talk about slim people because you are fat and you cry about being fat, then realize that it is a waste of time to cry and blame yourself and others. Start imagining how big change you can do by starting doing something. Start thinking about yourself how awesome you are and think about how much \"awesomer\" you can be by taking actions. b) you trash talk about your current job but you do nothing to change it. Utilize every second of your free time by thinking about how awesome it can be when you start developing yourself in some way and by becoming much more developed you can find another job much easier. Stop trash talking, it just sucks your energy. Start using this energy for something useful. For thinking about how awesome reading books is, how awesome you are because you are living on this planet and you can change yourself and become a better person.START HAVING A RESPONSIBILITY. START HAVING A CERTAIN AUTHORITY OVER WHO YOU ARE!Having a certain authority over who you are also comes with a change of thinking. From blaming yourself to starting admiring yourself. You start realizing that YOU ARE ENOUGH and YOU ARE AWESOME because you are here, AT THE PRESENT MOMENT! In the second step you can't get stuck at thinking. You have to apply your way of thinking in all the situations that you are in. You have to realize that changing of thinking isn't enough. You have to start acting by that(i.e.: You think that lying is not good, you believe in that but you also have to start being honest and stop lying.)Now you have to realize that you live in the present. You don't and can't live in the past or future. You can live only here, in the present moment. So every time think about What can I do NOW? What can I do NOW instead of watching TV? What can I do NOW instead of waiting for change?Maybe you think it is going to be hard but that's only half-true. If you have already changed your thinking, it won't be that hard to take actions as you might think. Because you have already changed your thinking. Now your new thoughts won't be like they were before: \"I will do it later; I will go to learn later; Now I have to watch this film to take a rest(by the way if you want to take rest, go to sleep)\" but they will be changed: \"I am here, in the present moment, and what useful can I do for myself? Okay, I can go to read. Okay, I can go to learn programming. Okay, I can go to work out.\" And by thinking like this and acting by this thinking it will be easier and easier for you and... Actions will become your habit. In the third step after you changed your thinking and changed your way of acting, your actions are becoming habits. Do you remember my sentence \"Human beings are creatures of habits.\"? That's exactly that.Realize what HABIT really is. Habit is something that you are used to do and you don't complain about that because ONLY YOU can choose what your habits will be - by taking the same actions again and again because of some purpose.Once your actions become your habits, you just have to keep watering a plant and it will keep growing. Keep pushing your limits, keep continuing in what you do and nothing will stop you. At the end you realize that you have become a new person. You realize that you did it on your own and you didn't need anybody to help you becauseONLY YOU CAN CHANGE YOURSELF. NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.You had to step up, take your lazy ass off of the couch and start doing something. You had to start taking yourself as an AUTHORITY, not just the next one human living on this planet. ",

I looked closer and couldn\u2019t believe it, I got off my chair and went and introduced myself. I told him that the night before I had written a review of his book. He\u2019s from the UK and was living in California and here I was randomly running into someone who\u2019s video had moved me. Who\u2019s books had changed me. Sir Ken Robinson\u2018s video Does School Kill Creativity? Is the most popular video on TED: Ideas worth spreading with over 44 million views. His two books Out of Our Minds and The Element inspired me to find my passion. Different people have come up with ways of figuring out what you were meant to do. In the book The Element, Sir Ken Robinson suggests two questions: 1. What subject came easy to you in school?2. What do you enjoy doing? The goal is to merge the answers together into your work. Others have told me they swear by the this venn diagram that says you should merge together something: 1. You\u2019re good at2. That makes people\u2019s lives better3. That will make you feel appreciated Mythologist Joseph Campbell comes at it from a tribal mythology angle where he concludes that we should follow what brings us joy. Peter Thiel the author of Zero to One who founded Paypal and led a team to become billionaire entrepreneurs who went on to create Youtube, Yelp, Linkedin, Tesla, Space X asked his team: 1. If you had a billion dollars to spend what problem would you solve in the world? I\u2019ve found it a hard for people to answer that one because it\u2019s so broad so I categorized them. What problem would you solve? 1. Animals2. Health3. Planet4. Equality5. Education6. Art There may not be any set way of finding out what you are meant to be doingbut hopefully I\u2019ve given you enough questions to ponder to find the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "There was a period of time in my life where scarcity was my status quo. Business was a cyclical roller coaster. Some days, my bank account sparkled with the crown of a Cash Queen. Other days, it looked like the Sahara. This feast-or-famine pattern became ingrained into my self worth, and I constantly felt like a failure. And even, sometimes, like a victim. \u201cYou\u2019re a struggling entrepreneur,\u201d I would tell myself, \u201cYou signed up to be poor for an indefinite period of time. Don\u2019t complain. Just work harder.\u201d Then one day, the stress, the shame and the heartache came to a head and I found myself on my knees in my office. I will never, ever forget this day. I had actually been here, on my knees, praying, crying and begging for a miracle, hundreds of times before. But this day was different. On this day, the pain reached a swell. I had no room left to wallow. No energy left to berate myself or my life. Instead, I began listing off, out loud, everything and everyone in my life I was grateful for, and I mean EVERYTHING and EVERYONE. I must have sat there for an hour, talking to the Universe, just sending out massive, massive love to one thing after the next. It was cathartic, emotional, and I can admit, a little dramatic. Calling BS on my feelings of unworthiness and lack to instead shine light on all that was beautiful, true and abundant in my life felt amazing. Even if it was only for an hour or so. Then\u2026a miracle a came. Literally the next day, I got a call out of the blue from a colleague offering me a six-month consulting contract. The amount of the monthly stipend offered was so large, it put me in an entirely new tax bracket. Soon thereafter, more financial opportunities like this starting rolling in. This contract led to three more contracts, freelance gigs starting picking up, I was getting approached by young women asking me to coach them, and on and on. This all happened in the span of less than one month\u2019s time. I didn\u2019t question the irony of this timing. I simply and humbly accepted that the Universe had just given me one hell of a message. I hadn\u2019t been waiting for the Universe. It had been waiting for me. When we stop focusing on what we don\u2019t have and focus on what we do, we open the floodgates to true abundance. Something else shifted that month besides the numbers in my bank account. My attitude about money completely changed, and I truly believe it was this change in perspective that continued to propel my financial opportunities: Poverty isn\u2019t synonymous with nobility. It just plain sucks. It\u2019s perfectly okay to say \u201cI desire to be wealthy!\u201d and then to go forth and create it. Abundance is awesome and something we should all strive for and celebrate. (Especially when it\u2019s sourced from following our bliss.) I have learned that we are all destined and designed to be prosperous, and there really is enough to go around. Abundance provides us more time, which leads to more freedom, which leads to more joy, which opens up our lives for more opportunities to serve. Period. Look, I know it\u2019s a LOT easier to talk about money this way once you have some. But during what was one of the most painful and poor times in my life, I came to realize it\u2019s not money that fires me up at all. It was during this time that I discovered what fires me up WAY more than making money. In truth, it is this fire that inspired me to create the brand SimplyBe. It was during this time that I did. It\u2019s the real reason I am writing this blog and why you are reading it. Here\u2019s what fires me up more than anything: People who truly love themselves, own themselves and cherish themselves. People who boldly shine their light and never apologize for it. People who are confident enough to let the shine of OTHERS illuminate them, not threaten them. People who hustle. People who take big-ass risks and aren\u2019t afraid to fly. People who take big-ass risks and aren\u2019t afraid to fall. People who know that falling is not only par-for-the-course, but a gift that makes us better. People who understand that true abundance comes from the things that have absolutely nothing to do with money: love, joy, connectedness and spirit. People who create, innovate and lead as individuals, and are empowered by a community of women doing the same. What fires YOU up more than anything? Did it take hitting a breaking point to discover it? I want to know your story. That story is part of YOUR brand. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you have to start by distinguishing between what you want and what you care about.     That seems like an odd thing to say, perhaps.  In our culture, it is generally assumed that these are one and the same, yes?   I care about what I want and I want what I care about.   At least, that's the default thinking, I believe. But I don't think that it's quite true.   There's  a difference between my wants and my assessment of what's important.   The things that are really important are what I care about.  What I want comes and goes, more like the weather.   What I care about is more stable: it has longer time horizons than wanting. Here's  an experiment:  next time you find yourself with a break from work or whatever, plop down in a chair and look out the window.   Notice the thoughts that come into your head.    I bet if you're like most people, one of the first thoughts is some form of \"ok, what do I want now?\".     One of the first things an idle mind does is try to come up with a new thing to want!  I find this rather amusing, it's a game I  play myself.    I'm free, relaxed, comfortable -- and, well, that's not enough, right?  I should want something too... maybe a snack, or a beer, or some entertainment.  New shoes, I dunno, something.    But none of that stuff is important, really.  The stuff that's important is going to demand more from me than \"go to the fridge, get the beer\".   It's going to ask me to be someone that I'm currently not -- someone more capable, more committed, more creative perhaps.     And  I think that's key: the stuff you're going to be passionate about is the stuff that's going to change who you are -- that's the stuff that's important.  It's fine to get a beer or new shoes and to have wants, but if you distinguish those from what is going to make a difference, you're more likely to find some passion waiting to be awakened. ",

            "answer_text": " Passion comes from investing yourself fully into something you love. Contrary to popular belief, you never find passion. It\u2019s not something you stumble upon or that just appears in front of you out of thin air. Passion is not a random gift you find lying on the street. It is a willow tree in your mind that was grown from a simple sapling.  People misunderstand passion as being a singular thing. There is only one passion in life, only one thing that you will love forever and only one true calling. There is only one gift-wrapped present waiting for you to be opened, and if you do not feel truly passionate then you haven\u2019t found that gift yet. This just isn\u2019t true. What\u2019s closer to the truth is if you think about your desires like an open field filled with tiny, little saplings. Every one of these saplings is a desire, like or joy you have for something. And just like a normal sapling, if you do not give your joys time, energy and love they will eventually wither with time. You\u2019ve had many joys already that you have not spent anything on and that you have then lost to time. Maybe you got lucky enough and stuck something through. If you did you will notice that, where once was a sapling, is now a beautiful willow standing in it\u2019s place. That Willow is what Passion is. Passion is nothing more than a desire, like or joy that you invested in. It\u2019s something you developed, grew and put in so much energy that you grew more interested and passionate about it day by day. As you got better at what you enjoyed you wanted to invest more time into it. As you developed a deeper understanding for it you wanted to learn even more. And as you spent more time into it you got more out of it. All of this, put together into one place, can be considered Passion. And it\u2019s the same way no matter where you go. If you do not invest time and energy into a relationship it will eventually die of neglect. If you do, however, invest, then the relationship will thrive. Relationships, Work, Hobbies, Friendships, Money, Success, etc. Anything you can be passionate about follows this same process. Whether or not a like turns into a passion depends on your investment.  What that means to you, who has not \u201cfound\u201d their passion yet, is that you simply need to pick something to invest into. Whatever you want to become passionate about, invest your time, energy, and soul into the already existing like and it will, eventually, grow into a full-blown passion. Start with something you enjoy, but pick something you want to further develop. And then learn as much as you can about it, challenge yourself to get as good as you can in it, and invest as much energy and time as you can muster. ",

            "answer_text": " Passion is something that your inner soul haunts for,something which knocks your sleep off every single night. Here is a logical approach to discover passion. 1.PERSPECTIVE MATTERS Even a mile starts with a footstep.However in this, the initiation is the thought. we need to enter by showcasing all the positive attributes of the passion. A weed can destroy entire crop.Its our attitude that lays as the foundation for the building. 2.KNOCK ALL DOORS!!! We have plenty of gates these days.Many times it so happens that we are so rigidly eyed on the closed door, that we ignore the door open for us. We need to try all the flavors of the life. We never know what kicks our heart. Furthermore we will get acquainted with different knowledge and enhances our tastes and interests too. A setback in life must be a detour but not a dead end. 3.RETROSPECT AND RE FRAME THE VISION Once we know what are the different areas of works going on, we can easily find our suitable ones. Its simple that now we have tried all the dishes of the restaurant we can order our preferred ones. But one may find it a bit troublesome because every flavor is an interesting ones, and hard to make a choice. 4.Recollect the past and your interests with the jobs. Psychologically passion is twined between the heart and mind. So it is something which we are more fond of.There will always be some triggering phenomenon behind every great adventure. Just find yours.!! As the saying goes..Rome is not built overnight.Passion is not something that can be achieved by burning midnight oil.It builds from the very happiness preserved sice ages. 5.Live with it. think of it, dream of it make it your life and live with it.feel the essence of satisfaction at every nick of time.invest more time on it. thereby you are actually exploring the subject and the field of interest. 6. Spend more quality time with the people already engaged in the field. This interaction can boosts up the nerves. It fills the voids of worries with everlasting excitement . it is indeed a resurrection. 7.Thread them up:Connect your daily chores with your likes.that way we would be doing everything we\u2019d love.this really explores the true yourselves. One who has mastered his body has conquered the world. 8.Obsession:Practice it happily and joyfully.Let there be no shackles of boredom and tiredness upon you. Ultimately once you are obsessed with it,you will find no bounds of time.Its like you will be getting younger as you dwell into it.Reveal the limits of the bravery that your heart can drive you through. UNLESS WE FOLLOW OUR PASSIONS WE ARE MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE. ",

            "answer_text": "I suggest to my philosophy students a simple exercise that might help. Ask yourself these 4 questions: What do you want to learn?What do you want to experience?What do you want to contribute?What do you want to leave behind?Based on these, you might find some things that will spark and lead to a passion. You might also find Ken Robinson\u2019s book The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything to be a good read. In thinking about what your passion might be, you may also want to consider some alternative views on the entire idea of passion. Here\u2019s a good place to start: Think Tank: Ever felt like your job isn't what you were born to do? You're not alone Dan Pink\u2019s advice in the column is to stop thinking so much about what you might be passionate about and stop worrying about whether you will ever find your passion. Instead: do something. Act! As he puts it: Ask yourself some questions like these: What did you do last Saturday afternoon \u2013 for fun, for yourself? What books do you read or blogs do you visit, not for work, but just because you're interested in them? What are you great at? What comes easily to you? What would you do \u2013 or are you already doing \u2013 for free? As it happens, I can testify to the power of de-emphasising passion and re-emphasising doing. Beginning about two decades ago, I worked in some very demanding, intensely stressful jobs in American politics and government. But throughout \u2013 on the side, usually for no money \u2013 I wrote magazine articles about business and work, and formulated ideas for books. At one level, it was foolish. I lost sleep, sacrificed leisure, and probably distracted myself from my paid employment. But after many years, it finally hit me: This \u2013 not politics \u2013 is what I did. And now, as a result, that's what I do. Am I passionate about it? Sure, I guess. Maybe. Some days. But passion isn't something I much ponder. I'm too busy doing what I do. You might find Dan\u2019s Book on motivation interesting as well. It\u2019s titled Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates us. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly I would recommend you ask yourself some basic questions.Such as- \u201cWhat do I like?\u201d\u201cWhat interests me?\u201d\u201cWhat makes me curious?\u201dAnd\u201cWhat do I feel an urge/impulse to do in life?\u201d There will, probably, not be any single answer to any of these questions. But, should you have any trouble finding answers to any of them then I suggest using the worlds greatest resource, the internet, to your advantage. Search through hobby, creative, artistic, craft, sport or any other websites that peak your interest.Remember, everyone is different. So it is about finding what you want to do. Create a list of things you would like to try, learn or do.Organise this list in order of easiest to achieve down to hardest to accomplish.Then work through the list.I advise keeping a written record of your experiences with each one, and how they made you feel. This isn\u2019t necessary for finding things you are passionate about. As you will know them when you try them. But it is an interesting thing to look back on. And it can help you discover what additional skills you have that can be transferred to other areas of your life, or put on a resume. I am sure, in time, you will find several things that you are passionate about. And that you love to do. With luck you may be able to find how to make a living doing them. And that is a good route to finding true happiness and contentment in life! I wish you all the best on your journey of self discovery!And I hope you find lot\u2019s of enjoyment along the way! ",

You need to see the world. And you need to meet new people. If you feel like you\u2019re in a bubble, get out. I grew up in Maryland. The east coast was a great place to grow up, but I wasn\u2019t into the politics that came with living right outside DC. I moved to San Diego for college. It was a life changer. Living by the beach, in one of the nicest cities in the world, has taught me so much about people and the environment. After four years here in college, I felt like I wanted a new adventure. So, I bought a one way ticket to Europe. I spent four months traveling. Seeing the world. Meeting new people. Trying new things. That experience taught me about getting out of my comfort zone. I can start a conversation with anyone anywhere. I can feel comfortable living out of a suitcase. I can adapt to different cultures while learning about the amazing people in our world. After three months traveling, I got tired. I wanted to stay put. I had an idea for a startup and was going to start it. I moved back to San Diego. Found a new home downtown. Starting working in the best incubator here. And started my company, Sourcify. If I hadn\u2019t traveled, would I have had the motivation to start? Would I have established a global network? Would I be willing to devote the next ten years of my life to building this company? To find your passion, you need to try new things.  ^One of my favorite days traveling Europe. Friends and I rented our own boat and drove it around the island of Capri! I called myself \u201ccaptain\u201d lol ",

            "answer_text": "One approach would be to try doing nothing and see if that gives you any ideas. Quit your job, quit washing your clothes, sell your furniture, sell your TV (don't sell your computer!), live on onions and cabbage and brown rice. See how you like it. You can spend all day at your passion if your passion is cheap--if your passion is writing or reading or composing computer music or computer graphics or volunteer journalism or computer animation or internet porn or listening to music or watching DVDs or computer programming. Even video work is cheap with modern SD-card video cameras. I got a good consumer HD camera on Ebay for $50. Technology makes indulging your passions real cheap. Even living in your car you can work on a laptop. If you don't like sitting around and engaging in low-cost passions, maybe you have expensive passions that will require that you find a way to make money. With that in mind, get your skills and interests evaluated by a professional counselor. It could be that (for example) becoming the Dr. House of malfunctioning Priuses you could make lots of money and still have energy left over at the end of the day (and maybe even in time open your own shop so you can make LOTS of money!) If you don't like sitting around with your low-cost passions, and more money for your passions is not going to help, then even working in a convenience store or driving a taxi or checking baggage at the airport starts to sound like an attractive proposition. There's nothing wrong with that. Another approach would be to look around for someone you admire, and try to be like that person. If you can not find anyone you admire, then you should consider the possibility that you are clinically depressed and that psychotherapy and/or medications might improve your life. Sometimes your passions will find you. Sometimes a man does not become a man until his life demands it of him. ",

            "answer_text": "3 steps to find what you love doing You can earn with a lot of uncommon things money. One of my favorites I had ever heard was about learning cats how to use the toilet! \u201cChoose a Job You Love, and You Will Never Have To Work a Day in Your Life\u201d said Arthur Szathmary*. But how would you find that one job you are really passionate about? So far nobody got paid for hanging out on the couch, binge-watching Netflix and eating Pizza, right?  Here is a simple 3-step process to come up with idea of your passions that might lead to a job or even better, a business of your own! Step 1 \u2013 Brainstorming ideas This will take you maybe 15 minutes \u2013 excluding the time you need to find friends and colleagues which you should also ask! Take an empty, white sheet of paper and write down whatever comes to your mind. Do not think whether it is a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad idea\u201d. Just write it down! Answer each of the following questions: 1. What skills and expertise do you have and you are good at? This can come from your formal education or your job, e.g. copywriting, software developing, creating presentations, bookkeeping, graphical design, communication, etc. 2. What are other people saying you are good at? Very often we are not even aware of our strengths, ask your friends and colleagues! They might have surprises for you. Take them seriously and write them down! Hint: You can also ask your mum. We can cross that out later! 3. What problems in your life did you successfully overcome? We grow with challenges. Have you been a shy person who couldn\u2019t talk to anyone and found a way to overcome? Have you been in financial trouble and figured out a way to solve that? All of those might be great ideas because it tells people you \u201calready succeeded\u201d in something and provide your knowledge to others. 4. What would you do if you had all the money and time in the world? Just because you don\u2019t get paid for what you love does not mean it couldn\u2019t be a great business idea. Are you into fashion? Do you spent a lot of time designing your garden? Are you tuning your car on the weekends? You should have now a list with at least 25 ideas!  Step 2 \u2013 Eliminate what you hate doing The next step is to eliminate any idea where you might have a great skill or expertise \u2013 but you actually hate doing it. Scratch it, gone! Here is a big trap though: Passion alone will get you nowhere. It is no guarantee for success. However I believe it is absolutely necessary to love what you are doing. Unless you have absolutely no emotions and no interest in a great life. So don\u2019t be fooled and just in for the money. A rich life is more than making money. Step 3 \u2013 Assess the potential profitability Now comes the last and extremely important step. Before you can even think of going out and starting your business you must figure out as early as possible if any of your ideas is actually going to be profitable. Basically you must be able to answer 2 questions: Profitability: Are there many people out there who would be interested in your idea?Ability and willingness: Are those people interested also able and willing to pay money for that?These questions are topics for itself, but only if you can answer both with \u201cyes\u201d you have a potential winner! * I found it hard to have full confidence of attributing this quote to Arthur, so let me know if you know more ",

            "answer_text": "The whole concept of \u201cfinding your passion\u201d is flawed and over-sensitized. There\u2019s never an ideal age or time or situation for passion. Finding passion is more about finding the right balance between your liking and skills. Most people focus too much on just one of these two things. One needs to accept the fact that one may like something that he/she isn\u2019t very proficient or skillful at or that one may be skillful at something that he/she doesn\u2019t like as much. \u201cEveryone thinks that passion = 100% choice of interest + 100% being skillful in it. But in reality, its all about finding the right balance and accepting that perfectionism is unattainable.\u201d But how to find the right balance? There\u2019s no better judge than your inner instinct. We all have that one inner voice which keeps telling us so many things. But we, being too naive and unmindful, keep ignoring and dismissing it as just another wishful thought. But in reality, it is this voice that can make us do a lot of constructive things in life. We all keep hearing it. But only a few listen to it. They are too scared to take any risk. Well, some risks are worth taking. I would rather live a life taking risks, than live one with regret of not having taken any risks. Having said that, it doesn\u2019t just end at taking risks.Honest and persistent effort, without caring about the result, is what determines how successful one would be! And if you are scared of going in the wrong directs, then don\u2019t worry. Its easy to get lost and give up. But you have to keep going and trust your instincts. There will be many people who will pull down your confidence, but the trick is \u2013 Keep believing in yourself and your capabilities.If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, no one else will! Also, does this assure success? Not everything is empirical. But \u2013 \u201cIf it has to happen, it will happen\u201d! Read more @ All about Passion ",

            "answer_text": "Every one of us has an internal compass called emotions. That\u2019s literally what they were made for: To steer us away from the things that harm us and towards those things that are for us. When you do something and from it you get a feeling of inspiration, flow and a desire to do and be more, that are the first indicators for passion. Exercises that can help you with digging deep are all kinds of reflective and introspective practices, everything that helps you dig up your thoughts and emotions and their causes. A few things to consider while trying to find your passion: It takes time and introspective work to find it. It won\u2019t appear on the day you ask the question. It\u2019s a learning process, so give yourself the time you need.Passion comes from being good at something. One of my big passions nowadays is Martial Arts. But when I started Martial Arts 6 years ago, I wasn\u2019t passionate at all about it. The only things I felt while training was that nothing worked, I wasn\u2019t able to do the movements and it hurt. But with time, I got better at it and it started becoming more and more fun until I was euphoric while training every time. What I want to say is: The thing you are passionate about might in the first times you are trying it cloak itself in fear, failure and a need for growth. So whatever you try out because you think it might be your passion, try it out for a longer period of time.Passion comes from flow. Here is the definition of flow from Wikipedia: \u201cA flow state, also known as being in the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time.\u201d If you want to find passion, follow the things where this positive immersion comes up for you naturally.I hope this was helpful. If you would like some personal guidance, I offer a coaching program where I guide you through the process of going both within and without to find your passion. If you would like to hear more details about that, send me a message here on Quora or on Instagram to @firewings_motivation. Looking forward to talking more to you about this! All the best,Sabine ",

At 19, I too was in a school that I didn't think was good for me (although my father did) and had to make a similar decision at your age.  Somedays I regret my choice, other days I don't.  So, I know its a big deal for you now and will be for you 30 years from now. I merged your two Quora questions before answering. Then, I researched you and your school a bit more and thought WOW, This kid got accepted to University of Uyo in Nigeria and is what we might call here \"pre-law\".   That's a huge accomplishment and I'm sure your parents are proud.   They named you Editor (19 years ago) and probably hoped you'd have a way with words and perhaps they even have subscribed to the pen is mightier than the sword belief since before you were born. Then I decided to check out your choice of profile picture:  Arvin Lal.  I had never heard of Arvin, so I looked him up: This 28-Year-Old Built A $3 Million Business In 10 Months Thanks To Instagram, He Says Wow, I wanted to learn more about Arvin.  I wonder if Arvin went to school, did he graduate?  So I looked Arvin up on LinkedIn: Arvin Lal  and yes, Mr. Lal worked very hard (2o hours a day he says in his videos) to earn two degrees, and I suspect that his MBA informs his business decisions and much of the brand persona building he is doing today.  I suspect he is also informed by the many writers, editors and lawyers he hires and works with as he creates his image and product marketing campaigns.    So now to your questions: How can I go about finding my passion?If law is not my passion, then how do I tell my parents?School work is very different than career work, so I would not judge future happiness in a career by your passion for the coursework.  Because some of the law classes can be tedious.  Before making a choice to change or to drop out, I would suggest that you pause.   Pause the decision by either continuing with classes and slogging through for the moment while exploring what you really want, or talking to the school about pausing your program, doing some passion finding exercises, changing your choice of studies.  Your school has a lot of resources to help you out.  You may want to start with your librarian, and perhaps a student advisor. I noticed that Uyo has many programs, so there is a lot to explore:   You are not the first student to have this concern and your university may have an office that helps students figure things out.   The school and your parents really want you to work hard, to love it and to thrive! For finding your passion there are a few exercises I like to suggest:  Time tracking, make a log and keep track of what you do during the day.  Write down what it was, how much you liked it, why you liked it.Library exploring, take yourself to the library, or really good bookstore, walk around the whole place.  Find at least 20 books that call to you.  It can be anything:  sports, health, photography, animals, spirituality, law, environment, sex appeal, technology, graphics, art, 3D printing, Brain Wave Recognition, Internet, Travel, Farming, Fiction, comics, video games, entertainment.   Take this stack to a table, flip through them, skim read as you like, as you do it make a few piles sorting the books by how they made you feel.   The great, good, indifferent, bad, and terrible.  Whatever makes sense to you.  Then look at the piles, which one is bigger?  Which one do you love more?  Which one do you hate?  Which pile of books would you like to be stuck with for the next few years?  Write down your feelings and what you learned about yourself.  (then offer to help your friend the librarian to put all the books back).Ask people who know you.  Ask your grand parents, ask your friends parents, as your spiritual leader.  Ask your wise friends, Ask your idiot friends.  Ask them:  When have you seen me happiest?  Weigh all these view points and write that down.Sit quietly, by yourself, close your eyes, and clear your thoughts, and do this until you have only your thoughts and examine what they are.Ask people in the prospective professions being considered.  What is the real job like? Why do you love it?  Are there specialties more interesting than others?   For example specialties in law: business law, media law, sports agent law, contract law, constitutional law, court litigation.Notice the things in life that really bug you, can you make a career out of fixing those things?Notice the things in life that just make you feel great, can you make a career around that?Make a pros/cons list, or chart, or map of all your thoughts.Can you finish and get a university degree?   What would you really like for yourself?   What sort of life or career will that mean for you?  Will you be happy and passionate and proud of your decision?Then maybe you are ready to tell your parents that you know what you like, what you are passionate about, and what you plan to do with the next few years.  Give your parents some credit, they really want you to thrive, because if you do they will rarely have to worry about you.Parents, Universities and Degrees are all great things to have in your life, please appreciate all that you have!Perhaps, in a few years you will be Mr. Arvin Lal's representative in Africa.   He will expect you to be your best. (I added this Sept 1, 2015)Best wishes!  I'm curious for your next question and to see what happens!   Please message and let me know.",

            "answer_text": "My definition of passion: An intense enthusiasm for a subject or activity -pretty straightforward. What makes you feel passionate about in life? Passion is the fuel that can help you turbocharge your manifesting skills. Without passion, your life will seem like a mundane mess. The secret to living with passion is to become passionate about being passionate. That\u2019s it. Just make being a passionate person your number one priority every day, all day. Passionate people are driven at every level and every stage of their lives. It\u2019s not that hard once you get the ball rolling. You can become passionate about anything. Grocery shopping \u2013 check, paying your bills on time \u2013 check, doing work you already enjoy \u2013 check. Passion is the secret sauce to life. Look at passionate people and observe how they always outdo their competitors. Take two people and give them a restaurant with the same tools and resources. I promise you that the more passionate of the two will be more successful. How interested are you in changing your life? Your behavior and your actions are the keys to transforming yourself. I know you heard the phrase, follow your passion right? This means whatever makes you come alive with excitement and vigor is the right path for you at that moment. Let\u2019s say making and baking brownies is the most exciting and passionate thing you do. Now let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been making and baking brownies every day for a year and now you\u2019ve lost your passion and excitement for doing this. Now what? You are no longer a passionate person because that thing you were excited about no longer makes you feel that way. What to do, what to do? Good, you just realized it wasn\u2019t the thing that you were doing that you were passionate about. What you accomplished if you were paying attention is that what made you feel excited about was your passion for life. It was never about the thing itself; it was about what you were feeling within your body that made you excited. You are passionate and when you don\u2019t feel passionate about your life you blame it on outside circumstances. The truth is you decide whether or not you start your day off passionate or not. You get to choose; it\u2019s your choice. Once you learn to make passion a priority I promise you that your life will reflect that to you in positive ways. What kills your passion? Without a doubt, the number one passion killer is negative beliefs and definitions about who you are and what you can become. Beliefs at their core are just thoughts you keep having again and again and again and again. The only difference between you and Gordon Ramsay are passion and beliefs. He believes he can do anything and maybe you do not. You must exhibit a passion for creating desire. That\u2019s the secret. Whatever you are doing, be passionate about it. That\u2019s it \u2013 it\u2019s not that difficult to understand. Here\u2019s your assignment. Everything you do after reading this post, do it with passion. And then go ahead and do it tomorrow, and the next day and the next day and the next day, and then keep doing it. You must exhibit a passion for creating passion! So, let\u2019s say you are feeling stuck in your life. You can\u2019t manifest change to save your life. The secret here is to begin moving and acting passionately. What happens when you do this is that your outer world will change according to the state of being you are projecting outward. Remember, this is the mirror or reflection technique. What the outside world is displaying to you is just a manifestation of your inner world. Change your inner world, change your outer world, so keep moving and acting passionately. You can\u2019t give up here; you can\u2019t quit. Live with passion as Tony Robbins so eloquently states. Go ahead and do it now! Be hungry, be driven, be obsessed with living with a passion so you can create the necessary vibrational state so you can attract what you prefer into your life. Do it now! Find Your Passion Finding your passion is easy once you know where to look for it. Passion is found within yourself, and you\u2019ll know you found your passion when you \u2018light up\u2019 while doing it. Finding your passion is done through emotion and not intellect. What did you love as a child? Were you creative?Did you love learning new things?Were you a people person?Did you love to teach?Did you love to read?Was your imagination powerful?To keep your passion high, you need to take a break from your passions so you can rebalance yourself. It\u2019s not that you are giving up on your passions, it\u2019s that with a break from them you get to rest yourself and renew your desires. >>>Become Passionate About Being Passionate ",

            "answer_text": "Remember back when you were a kid? You would just do things. You never thought to yourself, \u201cWhat are the relative merits of learning baseball versus football?\u201d You just ran around the playground and played baseball and football. You built sand castles and played tag and asked silly questions and looked for bugs and dug up grass and pretended you were a sewer monster. Nobody told you to do it, you just did it. You were led merely by your curiosity and excitement. And the beautiful thing was, if you hated baseball, you just stopped playing it. There was no guilt involved. There was no arguing or debate. You either liked it, or you didn\u2019t. And if you loved looking for bugs, you just did that. There was no second-level analysis of, \u201cWell, is looking for bugs really what I should be doing with my time as a child? Nobody else wants to look for bugs, does that mean there\u2019s something wrong with me? How will looking for bugs affect my future prospects?\u201d There was no bullshit. If you liked something, you just did it. The problem is not a lack of passion for something. The problem is productivity. The problem is perception. The problem is acceptance. The problem is the, \u201cOh, well that\u2019s just not a realistic option,\u201d or \u201cMom and Dad would kill me if I tried to do that, they say I should be a doctor\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s crazy, you can\u2019t buy a BMW with the money you make doing that.\u201d The problem isn\u2019t passion. It\u2019s never passion. It\u2019s priorities. And even then, who says you need to make money doing what you love? Since when does everyone feel entitled to love every fucking second of their job? Really, what is so wrong with working an OK normal job with some cool people you like, and then pursuing your passion in your free time on the side? Has the world turned upside-down or is this not suddenly a novel idea to people? Look, here\u2019s another slap in the face for you: every job sucks sometimes. There\u2019s no such thing as some passionate activity that you will never get tired of, never get stressed over, never complain about. It doesn\u2019t exist. I am living my dream job (which happened by accident, by the way. I never in a million years planned on this happening; like a kid on a playground I just went and tried it), and I still hate about 30% of it. Some days more. Again, that\u2019s just life. You have just believe in yourself and had crouge yo follow its\u2026\u2026. ",

However, what occurs on the off chance that you don't have the foggiest idea what your energy is This isn't only an issue for those starting their vocations, it tends to be an issue for those stuck in occupations that they despise. It's very simple to fall into a standard that leaves you exhausted or unfulfilled: you need to do the switch yet you don't know what to. These eight activities could assist you with finding your actual energy throughout everyday life. no, it isn't important to pick one. It is significant that you have one that you center most around, one which steadily funds you yet can take a shot at the same number of side interests as you want.And on the off chance that you are as yet confronting inconvenience or can't settle on a choice yourself, I suggest counseling ABROEDUSHIP . Their vocation directing assistance is phenomenal and makes certain to get you out. These are a few stages offered beneath to find your passion\u00ac- 1. Ask Yourself: Is There Something You Already Love Doing? Do you have a hobby, or something you loved doing as a child, but never considered it as a possibility?Whether it\u2019s reading comic books, collecting something, making something, creating or building, there is probably a way you could do it for a living. Open a comic book shop, or create a comic book site online. 2. Find out What You Spend Hours Reading About For myself, when I get passionate about something, I\u2019ll read about it for hours on end. I\u2019ll buy books and magazines. I\u2019ll spend days on the Internet finding out more. 3. Brainstorm Nothing comes to mind right away? Well, get out a sheet of paper, and start writing down ideas. Anything that comes to mind, write it down. Look around your house, on your computer, on your bookshelf, for inspirations, and just write them down. There are no bad ideas at this stage. Write everything down, and evaluate them later. ",

            "answer_text": "Last year, I found myself at 25, too, wondering how I had gotten so lost.  I found myself slipping away from what I had once thought was my passion; I wanted to pursue a career in academia, becoming a psychology researcher and professor. The problem was, that was all I knew. I had never really allowed myself to branch out beyond what I had studied in college, thinking at the time that this is what I was good at, and with all the time and effort I had put in to mastering one subject, why on earth would I try to study anything else? All that changed when I stepped into a bookstore around this time last year, and bought a book on something I knew nothing about: programming.  Because I had worked in clinical psychology in the past, I had all these ideas tucked away in my head on how I could help people with clinical disorders via mobile technology. It was all I needed to get hooked into trying something new. And once I began programming, it was as if I had discovered something unlike anything I had ever done before. It was a science, yet an art. It was intellectually stimulating, and challenging, but oh-so rewarding.  Receiving instant feedback from the computer, even after dozens attempts of errors, yielding just one successful result was the most rewarding thing I had ever felt. I had built that. Actually built that.  It's like a chef who had baked dozens of souffl\u00e9s, only to see them collapse right out of the oven, but with enough persistence, manage to pull off the most perfect, extravagantly fluffy souffl\u00e9. What a rewarding feeling. Leveraging the same metaphor, having the newfound knowledge-- and courage!-- to release my first iPhone app on the App Store, was like sharing that souffl\u00e9 with the world.  It took a lot of time, persistence, and a dash of risk-taking, but with the discovery of my new passion, I decided to take this new hobby and turn it into a career. I quit my job, spent months prepping for technical interviews, and decided to travel the world for the first time. The happy ending to my story is that I found a new job as an iOS developer, and even to me, it's still difficult to wrap my head around what just happened in the past year of my life. I've made an incredible transition into a new career I'm immensely passionate about, and it all started with one trip to my local bookstore. I think the key to my story is that passion follows discovery. And once you recognize it as a passion, to run with it. You first have to be open-minded and curious enough to learn something new and experience the unknown, and then driven enough to stick with it, and courageous enough to take risks for it. For me, once I let myself take the risk to quit my job, I decided to travel. And that, too, was one of the most eye-opening, rewarding experiences for me. I think if I had let myself continue doing what I wasn't so passionate about, I would have never found the courage to try something new and travel either. I wish you the best of luck in all your endeavors. Your passion is there -- it's just waiting to be discovered in a book, article, or maybe even here on Quora :) ",

            "answer_text": "I would sit in my room scared some days. Questioning my existence. Scared that I don\u2019t know what I want in my life. I still don\u2019t. I am still scared. But I force myself out of bed every morning. Keep up with my work. I feel scared again. But I go to classes. Try to read more. Try to fall in love again. Sometimes I feel like giving up. Sometimes I feel what\u2019s the point. But I still drag myself to eat. Then I do my work and try to sleep on time I feel so scared some days I can\u2019t even breathe. But then I work again every morning. I would listen to music. Talk to my sister. Laugh around with my friends. I would watch interviews of my life ideals, Ben Frankin, Elon musk , Charlie munger. I would try to improve myself. Then I would pray. Pray for love. Pray for meaning. Pray for health. I don\u2019t know what passion means. I never looked up in the dictionary. I pretend I know the meaning so that people think I am smart. A mother takes care of her child. Change his diapers and cleans him. She doesn\u2019t enjoy it. She does it because of her oxytocin connection. I don\u2019t know what passion means. So I look for oxytocin instead. I felt a great oxytocin connection to help others. It was so strong that I would work everyday 15 hours. But I started pondering more.Then I stopped believing in the idea. I became cynical. Then I sat in my room depressed and sad and unmotivated. Then I started feeling oxytocin in my life again to join a great startup trying to help the humanity. Then I started pulling off 15 hours again in life. I was bathing in oxytocin again. I hated the work. It was painful. It was oxytocin which kept me going. Then I lost faith in it. I felt my contribution was almost laughable. I lost the connection. Then I got depressed and sad again. Now I am in the gutter trying to build my oxytocin again. Oxytocin needs a healthy body. It doesn\u2019t come to a body if you are not healthy. I need to improve physically, emotionally , mentally and spiritually everyday first. (Shoutout to James Altucher) Then I would find my oxytocin belief again.Then I would go back to 15 hours a day routine again. People look for dopamine in their work.That\u2019s why they lose. Oxytocin is gazillion times stronger than dopamine. It\u2019s hormone for love. It trumps enjoyment and pleasure every time. If you look for enjoyment in your work. You will lose. Every damn time. If you get goosebumps while thinking about work even though you hate it, you have a oxytocin relationship. You have a shot at winning. Simon Sinek says look for why if you wanna develop your oxytocin relationship. Wright brothers had a why. Their competitors lost because they didn\u2019t. Wright brothers succeeded because they kept trying even though they failed a lot of times. They were not enjoying building a plane. But they would get goose bumps pondering at the possibility for us to fly. They had a oxytocin relationship. If you don\u2019t have one and you are lying depressed and sad in the gutter instead like me. Do what I am doing. Become healthier instead. Shubham Jain's answer to I feel alone. What should I do? Then your body will be ready for oxytocin. Without oxytocin, I feel scared, depressed, sad and lonely. But I pick myself again everyday to find it. Maybe I will look for the meaning of passion in the dictionary. Or write a letter to Oxford people to change the meaning in the dictionary. Maybe they will change it. Or maybe they will have a good laugh. I hope we can laugh together. ",
