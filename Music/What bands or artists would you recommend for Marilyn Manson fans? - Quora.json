            "answer_text": "Hey ya, thanks for this question. Marilyn Manson is in the industrial rock genre so I would give Nine Inch Nails, Ministry and Rammstein a try. However, if you like Marilyn Manson for his lyrics then I would recommend Slipknot, Korn (as someone has mentioned here), System of a Down, Rage Against the Machine, Linkin Park, Soundgarden, Tool and A Perfect Circle. They are in different music genres but their lyrics are amazing and of course the music arrangement, especially Tool, is ingenious. Enjoy exploring \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd1f\ud83d\udda4 ",
