So any suggestion I can make will be uninformed by this. This does put everybody here at a disadvantage. Sometimes, though, it is good if someone just hands you a list of possibilities and that might open up your mind to others that do suit you. So, I\u2019ll leave you with a small list of diverse names. Some of these names mean something beyond what you read. So look them up. Axiom Of Choice (math therm) Bass Instinct Beyond Rock Functor (math term) Rumble Revitalize Whatever you decide, the name has to `feel\u2019 right. There is no other way to say it. But when it does, you will know. The problem with four people though is that not everyone might feel it right for the same name. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "Hard question to answer because the band, or at least the key members need to agree. I usually start by throwing out names I think are good, and aren\u2019t in use by another band. That usually doesn\u2019t work, and my projects are stuck without a name. I have a project now that is ready to do shows but we can\u2019t find a name, so I feel you. I would suggest that you take a brainstorming approach, just write down as many names as possible, everything you can think of that is decent. Don\u2019t worry about how good they are. Then go back and cut the ones that you don\u2019t like, see if the names are in use, and come up with a short list to pitch to interested parties. Rinse repeat until you have a name. This has always worked for me, sans the most recent project. Opinions on band names are all over the map, so it is hard to recommend something without knowing the music and people involved. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what your theme is. I mean, I understand you\u2019re a rock/funk band, but what\u2019s the theme you\u2019re trying to convey? What kind of audience are you trying to reach out to? What do you want to be described as? What do you think describes your gig the best? All these are questions you should definitely consider answering by yourself and with your band before you think of a name. What are we? is the #1 question. It\u2019s okay if you initially don\u2019t come up with a smart name off the bat, or if the lot of you don\u2019t all agree on a single name firsthand. After some time, you\u2019ll all find something that you all like. The name of the band is usually the last thing to think of when forming one, so don\u2019t worry. Of course, I am great at naming things, so if you can\u2019t really find a name but you can answer all the questions I gave you above, you can just drop your thoughts in the comments, and I\u2019d be more than happy to help you find a good name :) ",

            "answer_text": "The etymology of band names is something of relative fascination for most musicians and fans. In most cases, band names have a specific meaning or relevance to the band members themselves - ABBA, for instance, is a palindromic acronym formed from the initials of the first names of the band members (Agnetha, Bj\u00f6rn, Benny and Anni-Frid). With the band Imagine Dragons on the other hand, the background behind the name is a secret known only to the band members; although they have released that the name is actually an anagram made from the letters of different words, the origin words are stil unknown. There are of course instances of band names having no specific meaning or importance to the band. Aerosmith was just a name invented by the band\u2019s drummer Joey Kramer and Blur was selected from a list of names offered by the label after the band was signed and forced to change their name. You mention \u201ca rock/funk foursome\u201d - so possibly using a play on that description - Funk4Fire - or even creating your own portmanteau by combining or blending words - Funkversation (like a funky conversation) will lead you to your new band name.
