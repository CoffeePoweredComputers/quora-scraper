            "answer_text": "Oh, you have missed a lot if you have heard only those two! Well, to tell you the truth, nothing gives me bigger pleasure that to share my love for music with a fellow lover! I always say that the best of Rahman, never came in Hindi! So, I am going to write about only those songs which never came in Hindi. Or even if they did, were a part of dubbed films no one saw. Note that the songs presented here is to just give you a glimpse! Check out the entire sound track. Most of the films have an excellent sound track and I had a tough time picking just one song. I also haven't included the recent classics like 'Vinnaithandi Varuvaya', 'Kadal', 'Kochadaiyaan' etc. This is old school Rahman to stick to only soft melodies!! Because no music lover should ever miss these. :) Here goes the list of the excellent songs. Mind you, they are quite a few! 1) Narumughaye - Iruvar  One of my biggest voice crushes is Unnikrishnan. The singer of this song. Beautiful melody. 2) Nila Kaikirathu - Indira  One of my all time favorites. I believe this is his best. I thoroughly enjoy singing this and I am sure I don't even come close! Sung by Hariharan this song is on my playlist titles 'favorite'! Check out another song called 'Thoda Thoda' from the same film. Another superb song. 3) Uyirum neeye -  Once again by Unnikrishnan. Soft melody. 4) Thee thee - Thiruda thiruda  Entire sound track of this film is awesome. Don't miss a single one. Deliciously sexy this is! Here's another song from the film I am crazy about. Chandralekha -  5) Naan Paadum Santham - Duet  Yet again the entire sound track is mind blowing. If you are about melody, you will adore it! The Saxophone is to die for! Played by Kadri Gopalnath himself!! Don't even miss the background music of this film! 6) En swaasa kaatre - En swaasa Kaatre  Another soft melody I love! And of course I can't help drooling over Arvind Swamy!! Perfectly chiseled to perfection he is! 7) En veetu Thothattil - Gentleman  Yet another superb melody only Rahman composes! 7) Thendrale - Kadhal desam  Once again the entire sound track of this film is fantastic. Sung by SPB and Unnikrishnan. 8) Sonnalum - Kadhal virus  Another beautiful melody. :) 9) Kannamuchi Yennada - Kondukondain Kondukondain  Yet again, the entire sound track of this film is mind blowing. Not a single song should be missed! The violins and Veena in this song is to die for! 10) Thee Kuruvi - Kangalal Kaidhu sei -  And that's why Rahman is a genius. Enjoy the melody. This can never happen in Hindi. Sadly. :( 11) Malargale Malargale - Love birds  Another excellent melody sung to perfection by Chitra and Hariharan. 12) Ennavale - Kaadhalan -  Beautifully sung by Unnikrishnan. Ignore the video. The entire sound track of this film is excellent. 13) Minnale - May Madham  One of my favorite songs. Listen to the entire sound track of this film too! 14) Vidukathaya - Muthu  Yet again, ignore the video. I chose it because the audio quality is good. A haunting melody. 15) Anbae Sugama - Paarthale Paravasam  I love all the songs of this film! Sung by yet another favorite - Srinivas! 16) Minsara Poove - Padayappa  Sung by Srinivas and Nityashree, this song is semi - classical. What a powerhouse singer Nityashree is! I adore her. I was elated to get the opportunity to witness her Kacheri! 17) Nadiye Nadiye - Rhythm  This song was my ringtone for a while! :) Once again sung to perfection by Unni Menon. I haven't even included some of his awesome tracks from films like Puthiya Mugam, Alaipayuthe and a bunch of others which were released in Hindi. I have also tried to stick to 'Soft melodies'. Check out Rahman for a lot of innovation too specially with Jazz, electronic, blues, etc. He is supremely talented! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you liked these recommendations, follow my music blog - Swarocean for more!
