            "answer_text": "As you seem a beginner I will reply on that basis only! A Music Producer can earn money from a Record Label but it will only be enough to buy a Subway with 1 year of income until or unless you are famous producer like Late Avicii! Record labels aren\u2019t prime source of income but they surely do pay well ONLY if you are famous, If you see any producer making money from label then he\u2019s definitely having any of the following things going in life, one or multiple: He\u2019s having a small/big business not related to Music which you don\u2019t know about!He belongs to a rich family & investing family wealth to get fame!Most commonly he will be a \u201cDJ\u201d (Like 70% times)Ghost production for other people!He\u2019s really BROKE!!My tips for anyone trying to earn money from EDM production: Ghost production will always be the top choice but problem is since you are a beginner no one would want you initially!Get job in a nearby studio as an Audio Engineer/Producer/Assistant producer (But they will ask you to produce what they want instead of your style & you will end up losing your own style & your music will sound S**T soon & once you will lose that talent they will kick you out)Provide mixing/mastering services on platforms such as Fiverr & many ore out there!Start DJing which is the top best choice, you will learn what\u2019s cooking in the industry and obviously you will make lots of contacts which will speed up the process by like x10 times!Team up with a DJ and perform as a duo but there is 90% chance that the duo will break up at some point & you will have you start from scratch with NO FAME & NO IDENTITY! (endless reasons can\u2019t explain in just one answer). Consider yourself to be the one of very luckiest if you get to keep up the stage name!You can Never solely rely on Music Production (if you will do it for yourself only), you will need to combine it with something else for sure! This might hurt your feelings but you need at least 5 years of hard work unless you get lucky & there is a high choice of being unlucky! Good luck with your venture & DON\u2019T GIVE UP, IT TAKES TIME! ",
