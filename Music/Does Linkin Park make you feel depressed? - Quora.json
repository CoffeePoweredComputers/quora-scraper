            "answer_text": "No they don't make you feel depressed rather it makes you feel uplifted with the thought that there are millions other out there who are suffering from depression and it's okay. We all have depression at some point in our life. The more we think about it, the worse it gets. So rather we should be thinking positive always. That is the message given by Linkin Park. You listen to songs according to your mood. If you feel depressed you would listen to Linkin Park because it would be giving you that much needed boost. But if you are happy and you listen to them then it's obvious you would be feeling depressed. RIP Chester. Peace Out!! ",
