            "answer_text": "No. She was never considered best dancer to begin with. Blinks praised her as one, but there isnt any like, certification that she is one and whatsoever. Exhibit A. Lisa has a lot of fields to improve in. Firstly, Lisa has amazing stage presence. Like, amazing. I dont care if people think it is just smile and \u201coooh\", but find me at least 10 different other dancers who dont just smile and wink. Okay you cant. End of conversation, she has amazing presence. There are moves when she looks stiff, which sometimes is the reason why people praise Rose for her amazing dance technique and said they prefer it over Lisa's. She could improve her stiffness, which i think is very important. EXHIBIT B. She never proved herself enough. On the other side i also think she has stuff to prove. To me, all the other idols who have proved they deserve to be called best dancer, proved their techniques. Seulgi has at least 4 different technique while Momo has at least 3. Lisa? Im not saying she doesnt have more than just 1, but she has never proved it. I have never seen her doing crack dance and whatsoever. Versatility. Lisa does an amazing job at fast and power dances. Recently we also saw her dancing youthful songs. However thats only 2. I partly blame YG on this. Blackpink choreography are way too easy and he barely put Lisa on dancing shows. However, to die-for-blackpink Blinks, admit the truth she hasnt shown herself enough. And therefore it isnt valid to qualify her as best dancer. Since Blackpink debuted, Lisa only have around 6 solo stages and it isnt enough. EXHIBIT C. Poor free-style. I'm sorry, but her freestyle is the thing i am very much disappointed in her. Wave dance, hip swaying, lie down, wink, kiss, done. Those things repeat again and again in her freestyles and i got bored of it. It comes off as interesting to watch, because her amazing presence save it. But really, look at her moves. CONCLUSION Overall i think Lisa might have more potential than what i have said. But the biggest point is she never proved herself enough. As long as her number of solo dance stage can count on fingers and the number of genres she can dance in is under 5, she doesnt verify as the best dancer to me. She is overhyped a lot. You can not judge someone\u2019s ability by that little amount of things you have seen. And if she didnt debut with Blackpink or Blackpink flopped? Sorry not sorry, from what ive seen right now she will never even be on best dancers list.  ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think Lisa is considered the best dancer in K-Pop today. Among the top ten, maybe. But people who cite her as a great dancer are noticing three other things, I\u2019ll argue: 1) her enormous stage presence, which is undeniable; 2) her foreign-ness, not being Korean, which gives her this air of uniqueness; 3) her look and style go over particularly well among non-Asian audiences. If she debuted in a different group she\u2019d probably be the standout, and so it\u2019s possible her reputation might be bigger than it is today. BTS, IU, and Chungha were never managed by the Big Three. Lisa\u2019s reputation as a dancer is boosted by her having particularly long legs, and she looks the part. But K-pop has never seen a female rapper rise to the top as a solo artist, even CL. And she doesn\u2019t seem to have the range to become a strong solo artist. But her celebrity appeal is so strong I\u2019d put her near the top of any list of K-pop celebrities who could go global. Btw, realize there is an argument to be had about whether CL made it to the top; I think she\u2019s great. ",
