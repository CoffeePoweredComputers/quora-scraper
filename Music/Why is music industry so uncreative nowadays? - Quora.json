            "answer_text": "The music industry is so uncreative now because there is is no incentive anymore to dedicate your life to being a musician. There is no money in it! In mean, none! What bright talented young person is going to decide to get into a profession in which, if people like your music, they\u2019ll just steal it? Why do you think all the big music stores, even Tower Records went out of business? People were stealing music and the courts turned a blind eye to it. They just allowed the music industry (formerly one of our nation\u2019s biggest exports) to be pillaged. Well, the thieves got what they wanted; they got their \u201cfree music.\u201d Now they, and the entire generation of young people is paying the price: You stole their opportunity to become the rock stars of the 21st century. There is no good new music. Who is the 2019 equivalent of what Metallica were 30 years ago? There\u2019s nothing even close. The best answer to that would be \u201cMetallica\u201d because they\u2019re still at the top of their profession. They were fortunate enough to come along at at time when the business model of making albums that people would buy in music stores enabled them to become who they became. That opportunity has been decimated; it\u2019s just not there anymore. The only rock bands making good money today are the ones who made their names in the music industry when there was still incentive to become great! There are no new rock stars to have come along since the advent of illegal downloading and music streaming. Why? because that business model just doesn\u2019t work! It destroyed all incentive! If I\u2019m wrong, tell me, who is the modern day equivalent to bands like The Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Guns \u2019n Roses, or Metallica? Who are the great success stories in rock music of the 21st century? Who are the legendary guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen that are products of \u201cthe new business model for music\u201d? How many can you name? With the traditional system there are too many to name! You know what the most incriminating evidence of this is? The rock music industry was turning out rock star after rock star in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s until illegal downloading and file sharing appeared. Then all of the sudden, guess what? No more new rock stars. That as an abrupt death to what was a thriving industry for the past 50 years wasn\u2019t it? Does that seem unnatural to you? Maybe a little? Maybe a lot??? That\u2019s the price of all the young people demanding \u201cfree music\u201d as if it were their right, as if they created it and it were their property. You got what you wanted and all it cost was your future because it\u2019s gone. ",

            "answer_text": "The music industry today is run like a cut-throat corporate business. Art has long been replaced by commerce. Labels don\u2019t take risks today, they are looking for the artist to do as much work as possible and show them a profit making business model. Yes, it\u2019s business. I know people like to think, \u201cIt\u2019s music man, it\u2019s coming from an another dimension\u201d but the way the suits see it, it\u2019s all business. To answer you question specifically here\u2019s a story from a famous record exec. There was supposedly this guy that wanted to get signed and the label execs went and saw him. He had a good business model and his show had an attendance of almost a 1000. The exec basically said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what else I can do for you. You are already doing great, you are keeping your own publishing rights and KEEPING all your generated income\u201d. The guy went for a deal anyway but I guess ended up leaving the label, I think. Why? Up until that point, he was in complete control and he could do whatever he wanted and write the songs he wanted. Once he signed to a major label, they started telling him, \u201cthis is the type of song we want\u201d. At that point, creativity stops, you are basically writing what the label wants and usually they accept 1 out of 5 or 1 out of 10 songs you write. Today songs are written by a group of people. It is not uncommon to have a room full of writers bash out songs in a series of afternoon sessions perhaps. One person will write the lyrics, one will come up with the hook, one will come up with the melody. So a song today is very formulaic and sort of pieced together as opposed to one sole artist writing the whole song (which can still happen). So the label thinks it knows what the masses want and writes or instructs its writers to write accordingly. For example: 10\u201315 years ago, the rule was, if you don\u2019t hook the listener in by the first 30 seconds, he moves on to the next song. TODAY the rule is 9-15 seconds tops. That is, you have about 9 seconds to hook the listener in or else he will click next on Spotify or Pandora. What this means is, your verse better start rather quickly and the chorus should typically kick in before the 40 second mark. Do you see how formulaic this is? Only accomplished artists like Adele are allowed to have intros longer than say 5 seconds (because we will wait for her not just anybody). This is the message WE and our digital (I can\u2019t be bothered with anything) culture have sent the labels. It\u2019s this \u2018me\u2019 centered culture that has driven the music industry into the ground. The labels are simply responding and modifying themselves to our needs. The inadvertent result is crappy music. ",
