            "answer_text": "Conscious listening happens for a very little time on a normal day. However subconscious or assisted listening can happen for as long as you want. Meaning, people put on music while working on other things, be it household work or office work. This kind of music listening is actually not focussed because you are busy doing something else and music is only there to add to background noise. Conscious music listening is when you are actually listening to the music, understanding it. Usually when you are watching a music video, or listening to new artists with your friends, or in a live concert. ",
