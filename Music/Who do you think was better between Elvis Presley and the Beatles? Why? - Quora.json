            "answer_text": "Better at what? Elvis was better at cutting through the racial lines of music and introducing black music to white America. Elvis was a better dancer and crooner. The Beatles were better songwriters and reintroducing rock 2.0 back to America. The Beatles had better harmonies. Elvis had a better stage show whereas the Beatles were better in the studio. Elvis had a better looking wife in his heyday than The Beatles did in their heyday. Note: the last point was purely tongue in cheek and highly subjective. ",

            "answer_text": "Come on. Why such a disrespect to popular musicians? Who was better, Beethoven or Mozart? Nobody asks questions like that because it nos possible to answer when both are amazing. The same about Elvis and the Beatles, and even more impossible, as they were very different to compare. Elvis was a solo singer, Not a band. Elvis was not a songwriter either. And the Beatles were unique. Sure the Beatles caused a buch bigger revolution, but Elvis somehow, started it all. He was one of The Beatles idols. When will people ever learn only to appreciate without comparing? ",
