Now I'm all for creative solutions and perhaps something with a little wheel can be manufactured (though I'm imagining that if you bump into something by mistake you'll lose your teeth) but it seems extremely unmanageable: the entire marching band tripping over those things, steering issues.... One big disaster. Another good contender: The Blackpool high tide organ:  Good luck with that one. Not only do you need to bring the instrument, but you need a sizable bit of the ocean as well. ",
