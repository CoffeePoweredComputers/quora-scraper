            "answer_text": "Jennie was born in Anyang, a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. She was raised partly in Seoul, and partly in New Zealand. Jennie is rumored to come from a wealthy family, as her mother is a shareholder and director at the entertainment company CJ E&M Entertainment, which is an extremely large corporation that owns the channel Mnet, as well as tvN, Stone Music Entertainment, and many more media, film, and entertainment companies as subsidiaries. This company is also responsible for events such as MAMA (Mnet Asian Music Awards), KCON, etc. Her father is rumored to be the owner or director of a hospital in the district of Gangnam in Seoul. Gangnam is known for being a very wealthy district where many celebrities and heirs/heiresses live, so this suggests money on both sides of her family, which likely explains her studying abroad. Jennie went to boarding school in New Zealand and lived in Auckland, NZ for five years. She went to a co-ed school known as ACG Parnell College. She eventually moved back to South Korea and became a trainee at YG Ent in August of 2010. She trained for about 5 years and 11 months before debuting with BLACKPINK in August of 2016. Hope you enjoyed! ",
