And, \u201cYeezus\u201d is what he calls his studio album. Kanye, is in some form religious, and considers himself an acolyte and messenger of The Word. Many are interpreting these times as foretold in Biblical eschatology, for instance, Kanye inditifies with Revelation 6:8 \u201c I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth. Plague?Sword is violent unrest, even war. \u201cHe who has ears, let him hear.\u201d- Jesus Christ of the New testament. ",

            "answer_text": "He calls himself Yeezus because he is a God, even though he considers himself a man of God. In the bible, King James Version, Psalms 82:6 says: \" I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.\"-Bible Gateway passage: Psalm 82:6 - New International Version   In case you didn't know, Ye is another nickname for Kanye West, coming from the last two letters of his first name (KanYE). So basically the bible itself says Kanye  is a God (as are other believers, according to that verse). Notice that he never calls himself The God, but a God. ",
