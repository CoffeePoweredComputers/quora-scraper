            "answer_text": "On occasion, some of them do. I suspect that a shocking percentage of actresses in major Hollywood films decided to take the \u201ceasy\u201d way up and put out for producers, directors or key actors who could get them work. In fact, one young actress, who remained anonymous, submitted an article to an entertainment blog called Crazy Days And Nights. Today\u2019s Blind Items \u2013 I Worked On A Yacht -Part One (N.B., when an actress goes \u201cyachting,\u201d it is typically on the Med, for extra cash, which she earns by being a prostitute in international waters.)  \u201cBut I\u2019m too PRETTY to work at Safeway!\u201d Here is part of what the actress had to say: Each week you never know if your job will be lost. Will the show be canceled? Will the audience hate your character and you get fired? Will you ever get another job if you do get fired? I remember on my first movie, I thought I knew everything. I had been working for a decade and breezed into work, excited about this new challenge. I think it was day 3 on the movie when I was told I had to f**k the lead actor in the movie or I would lose my job. The thing is I had known this actor for a long time. Apparently he is the one who had me cast in the movie and now was payback time. I didn\u2019t know he cast me. I didn\u2019t know he liked me like that. My network show I had been on just ended. I had nothing lined up but this movie and a crap movie someone talked me into doing. I needed this paycheck. I did it. I slept with the guy. I have hated him since. I have never seen anything he has done. He is a f**ker who took advantage of the situation. I had known him almost my whole life but he was willing to have me fired unless I had sex with him\u2026. What\u2019s worse, the prostitution rings in L.A. are so elaborate that you\u2019d think the movies exist to support prostitution and not the other way around. Actresses who are not above screwing for money will fight for a magazine cover, because they can take the magazine cover overseas and show them to Middle-Eastern oil sheikhs and BAM!, the girls can demand a higher price\u2026  \u2026although some of the slags from British reality TV are apparently spending so much time selling themselves on yachts that it\u2019s driving down the prices. Think about that during the next Cannes film festival. This is not to say that all actresses have to do this. It\u2019s also not to exclude men who turned \u201cgay for pay\u201d to get a part. But I suspect that powerful men in the business know that a good movie role is bait that actresses want.Also, here is the second part of that article.Today\u2019s Blind Items \u2013 I Worked On A Yacht \u2013 Part Two***UPDATE*** As I write this, it is Dec. 13, 2017. The names Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Kevin Spacey have now been tarnished with serious allegations of ongoing sexual harassment. This is a vindication of my cynicism, although some are issuing denials. It is not a completely universal problem, given that some powerful executives simply won\u2019t find it tasteful to coerce talent onto the casting couch. But there are plenty of powerful people who exerted their influence to commit sexual assault with impunity. The fact that I\u2019m not anywhere near Hollywood doesn\u2019t mean my suspicions were frivolous. We\u2019ll know more after the pleas are entered. ",

            "answer_text": "I HAVE to add this\u2026 I used to have Cinemax on my cable lineup and Cinemax is infamous for its\u2019 soft core porn movies: But the difference between Cinemax and full porn movies is that Cinemax sex scenes don\u2019t actually show the \u2026 Male/Female physical body contacts\u2026 whereas full porn does. This is done via the camera angle: So in these Cinemax movies it is difficult to determine if the actors are or aren\u2019t actually have sex on camera. Is Cinemax Casting Couched? I would say so. How ELSE could they audition for or rehearse these types of scenes\u2026 And how many times would each scene be shot? And by simply moving the camera from the front view to the side view the scene is changed from soft core to full porn. I have no doubt Casting Couching exists\u2026 I have seen a LOT of really bad movies which always featured nude or bare-bosomed actresses in it, and in nearly all of them they are throwaway nude or topless/shot twice scenes involving mute/nameless actresses. Examples of these are \u2026 In the low budget movie series \u201cDeathstalker\u201d there are very brief scenes featuring topless women added to the theatrical release, but in the cable/tv version these scenes are cut out. Or their breasts are blurred out. In the original \u201cBeastmaster\u201d movie, Tanya Roberts and an unnamed mute Blonde actress did the same scene twice: The bathing in the river scene just before Marc Singer\u2019s character meets them for the first time. One scene had both the actresses fully dressed, the second had their tops down and their breasts bared. In this case, I don\u2019t really think Ms. Roberts was Casting Couched, but I have a suspicion the Blonde may have been because she is only in that one scene in the movie. The reasoning behind this is simple\u2026 There is only one Tanya Roberts, but there are countless Blondes with big breasts\u2026 And if this particular blonde actress-wannabe wanted to  keep this tiny part in the movie, she\u2019d might decide to have sex with the producer/director/cameraman/key grip/caterer/janitor/gate guard to do it! Casting Couch is also an insulting term when applied to movies/TV: Example: The movie \u201cBattleship\u201d\u2026 Before it even came out those critical of this flick were saying that the only reason this was being made, was so they could break out the sex-soaked casting couches! For actresses dumb enough to \u201cTry Out\u201d(You know what that actually means.) for a role in what was likely to be an all-male movie to begin with! It was also lampooned on the \u201cMarried With Children\u201d TV show: In this episode Kelly Bundy is trying out for parts in commercials and she comes back saying \u201cIt\u2019s TERRIBLE! They won\u2019t touch me\u2026 Well, they will touch me but they won\u2019t give me the part!\u201d And also in this joke I have posted over the years\u2026 What is the difference between an actress wannabe and a DUMB actress wannabe? The  Actress Wannabe with sleep with the producer to get a part in a movie, BUT a DUMB Actress Wannabe will sleep with the producer AFTER HE TELLS HER SHE\u2019S NOT GETTING THE PART!. It\u2019s also an insult when applied to actresses: Example\u2026 Dustin Diamond from the \u201cSaved By The Bell\u201d tv series wrote a book about his time on the show, and it was no secret how much he hated the show: I commented at that time, \u201c I haven\u2019t read his book but I have an idea on what he\u2019s likely to say. That all the guys, except him, were either drunk, on drugs, and/or running the casting couch scam on starlets who wanted to be in the TV series. And how all the girls were sleeping with the TV executives to keep the show from being cancelled when the ratings dropped.\u201d And consider this as well, if \u201cSuzi\u201d, the starlet-wannabe, won\u2019t do a striptease then have  simulated sex with a guy on camera, then the studio will get \u201cCandi\u201d, \u201cCharlene\u201d, \u201cSandi\u201d, \u201cSoozi\u201d, \u201cChantel\u201d, \u201cDarline\u201d, or \u201cCinnamon\u201d who will\u2026 And she\u2019ll eagerly \u201cAudition\u201d(Again you know what this means ) for the producer/director/financial backer/whoever to get this part!
