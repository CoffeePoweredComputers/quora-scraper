You need those too.Know that your goals for your music are yours. No one else\u2019s to tell you what you are working for. Keep your Goal at the Forefront of every decision involving it.In the end for me, I only wanted to write a song. That was it. But when I did, I wanted to do more and more. I wanted a song recorded, then I wanted a song with a video, a song with a band, perform on a stage, own it. Now, it\u2019s completely a different story. I sit at home, I don\u2019t play out, I write, and record and create for the sole purpose of streaming and an income using my passion that I can pass on to my children no matter how big or small it is. Maybe for you Touring is what you want to do. The old fashioned way selling tickets and Merch on top of Sales and Streams. There is the Career that a lot of people thought I wanted, but I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m happy in my little studio. I\u2019m living MY dream this way. There are so many avenues you can go down to make money with music. What will it take? You. At the end of the day, that is the only one responsible for NOT doing it. Good Luck Superstar!!

            "answer_text": "Networking is the key.  I know, I know\u2026it sounds cliche in the music business to hear (cue my old man voice) \u201cYou must network if you want to be successful!\u201d Nevertheless, it is true. You must network and you must do it properly. How do you do it properly you ask? Here's how: Move to where the music business is.Build up your courage and move to a music town. I struggled with this for a while. I thought \u201cOh, since streaming has changed the music industry I can just make music in my garage and never leave - that's gonna make me successful. Right?\u201d Wrong.You need to be around like minded individuals. You\u2019re gonna be hard pressed to find them in your sleepy town. In fact, my experience has been there are more fakes and wannabes in non-music towns than in legitimate music towns. Why? Because it's easy to walk out your door, get a bar gig and act like you're the greatest gift to mankind. It's difficult to move 100s of miles away from where you grew up and start over. That fact alone weeds out a lot of the junk.Put in the time to network.Once you move to a music town, go to where the successful people are hanging out. Actually go out to the bars, clubs, and venues and stand next to these people. Strike up a conversation. You'd be surprised where it can lead. Don't sit on your can and watch TV all day.Ask people out for lunch. Don't be afraid to spend money on food, coffees, and beers for other people. It\u2019s much easier to get to know someone one on one at Starbucks than it is to yell at them over the PA in a dark, crowded club.Be genuine.Successful people KNOW people. They did not become successful by not knowing their way around a conversation. Don't constantly talk about yourself. Shut up and listen. You might just learn something.Don't bullshit people. Just don't. They will figure it out. Know your craft so you don't have to fake.Meet people with the intent of building a relationship with them. Try not to think about how they can further your career.Apply good judgment on who you associate with.Find people who are real. And don't be afraid to challenge them on what they know. Just do it respectfully by asking questions.People who smoke too much, drink too much, or do heavy drugs. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.People who lie and cheat are not who you want to be around. You do not have to lie and cheat to be a professional musician. Anyone who says otherwise is a snake. Run from snakes.Be a \u201cgood hang\u201d. This is the single most important thing you can do.No one gives a rat\u2019s behind how good of a songwriter or player you are if you are an arrogant knucklehead. People are fragile. They hate jerks as much as you do. Don't be a jerk.Get to know people. Let them talk about themselves. Let them open up. People LOVE to talk about themselves. Understand this and remember this at all times.Serve people. Ask them what you can do for them! Don't ask people to do favors for you. Be proactive and people will notice.If this all sounds like a bunch of hogwash to you then might I suggest you read How To Win Friends And Influence People. The guidelines in that book have helped me tremendously. If you follow them well, you will go far. Better paying gigs will come. I can still hear my piano teacher saying in his Philadelphia accent, \u201cSuccess is preparation meeting opportunity.\u201d Cheers. ",
