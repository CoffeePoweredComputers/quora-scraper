            "answer_text": "An anthology is a collection of writings (short stories, poems, articles, essays) smaller than the total set from which it is selected, usually by multiple authors. The name is derived from Greek and means \u201ca garland of word-flowers.\u201d One of the first such collections was The Greek Anthology, an accumulation of poems by authors known and unknown from classical and Byzantine Greece. I recommend it if you love poetry. ",
