            "answer_text": "You are not. Many people didn't know who Selena was before she died. Interestingly neither did People magazine because shortly after her death, they released an issue with her on the cover. Before Her Time (Before Her Time) But, there was a catch, you had to live in the Southwest USA to buy it. The rest of the country received an issue with the cast of Friends on the cover. The former would sell-out while the latter would not. The ensuing furor was justifiable. Selena fans in other states, including Michigan, Washington, and even Alaska, demanded to know why they were not getting this issue. In response, the magazine apologized for their blindness, and to make amends, they issued a special commemorative tribute to Selena and when combined the two editions would go on to sell over 1 million copies. Billboard Eventually, this experience inspired the editors to launch People en Espa\u00f1ol, a magazine dedicated to showcasing Latino stars from the world of film, television, music, sports, and politics. Tufts E-News -- Grad Named Head of 'People en Espa\u00f1ol' In short order, other outlets discovered this untapped market and scrambled to hitch a ride on the \"boom\" in Latino music, arts, and entertainment. Crossover acts such as Ricky Martin, Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias, would begin releasing their first English language music albums, leading to the launching of the Latin Grammy's awards show in the year 2000. On TV, Hispanic characters started appearing in shows like Desperate Housewives, Ugly Betty, and the George Lopez Show. In 2005, on the 10th anniversary of her death, the Spanish language network, Univision, produced and filmed a tribute concert, Selena \u00a1VIVE!, attended by over 50,000 people in Houston, TX. It would become the highest-rated and most-viewed Spanish-language event in U.S. history. Billboard Fast forward today, and we finished watching Demi Lovato, Shakira, and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl LIV. All this, thanks to that small-town girl from Texas, nobody knew. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Am I the only person who hadn't heard of Selena before she died? Unfortunately for Selena\u2019s legacy, the answer is \u201cNo.\u201d Many people had never heard of Selena because her career was badly mismanaged and because her record company did not have her expand her range. Selena was a popular Tejano singer and that art form wasn\u2019t as popular as R&B or pop where she could have made a bigger name for herself, and perhaps have become even more successful. Following her death, there was an attempt to make her a legend based upon her short life and her tragic death. again, unfortunately like her career, this was also mismanaged. Jennifer Lopez, a puertorrique\u00f1a (A woman of Puerto Rican descent) was cast in her role. Although Lopez was attractive, she couldn\u2019t sing, and she didn\u2019t resemble Selena. The movie woefully underperformed (On a budget of $20 million is barely made $36 million) and Selena\u2019s music sales didn\u2019t receive the boost that was expected. So you aren\u2019t alone when you say that you hadn\u2019t heard of Selena before her death, questioner. Even today is she\u2019s not as well-known as she should be given the circumstances of her death, and the fact that she\u2019s been the most successful Tejano singer in the US so far.
