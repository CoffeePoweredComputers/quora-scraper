            "answer_text": "Loudness and ear damage are directly proportional to each other. In other words\u2026.. More loudness = More damage, that is, if you listen for a long time with high volume. Listening for a short time is mostly fine, but if you listen for hours on end, there is a high possibility that you will get irreversible ear damage. If you really want to listen to music in a loud place, I'd suggest investing in a noise cancelling headphone. You see, noise cancellation is a marvel to the modern world, and humans have not looked back to the time of simple earphones once noise cancellation was introduced. I am assuming that you want to have the music loud so as to drown outside noise, and noise cancellation serves just that purpose. All you need to do is type in Noise Cancelling earbuds/headphones and you will see more than you can think of. However, to answer your question, if you really want to listen to loud music, without causing ear damage, you don't have any options\u2026..sorry. you can't listen to loud music and not expect your eardrums to reduce their capacity of hearing. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "If you listen in a large reverberant room, the sound can seem louder without being so powerful. This is a good way to keep musicians from having hearing damage. The other way is to put a lot of sound absorption around the room. This softens the sound. ",
