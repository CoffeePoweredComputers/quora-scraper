            "answer_text": "Regardless of whether you\u2019re a total newbie\u2026 Or you\u2019ve had a decent home studio for a while now\u2026 The same question always lingers somewhere in the back of your mind: What\u2019s the next step? Because when you see all those incredible images of pro studios on the internet\u2026 And you compare that to where you are right now\u2026 It\u2019s only natural to want that one piece of the puzzle which gets you a step closer to where you someday want to be. Which is why for today\u2019s post, the goal is to help you find that next step. Which we will accomplish by covering a list of 33 items you can eventually add to your studio\u2026from beginner to advanced. But first\u2026let\u2019s determine exactly what level you\u2019re at right now\u2026 The 4 STAGES of Growth  Starting from day one\u2026 Studios go through 4 KEY stages in their evolution: Bedroom Studio \u2013 which is typically a small setup next to your bedside, and is the absolute minimum you need to record sound into your computer.Dedicated Home Studio \u2013 which is typically a room in your house used solely for recording, that includes both studio furniture, and acoustic treatment.Semi-Pro Studio \u2013 which can be either at your home, or a different location, and typically includes the equipment necessary to record multiple musicians simultaneously.Pro Studio \u2013 which is typically located at a commercial facility, and includes whatever tools necessary to produce professional results in the most efficient way possible.Up next, I\u2019ll show you exactly what\u2019s required in each of these 4 stages. If you\u2019re new to this website, go through them in order, so you don\u2019t miss anything. HOWEVER\u2026 If you\u2019ve already made it through the first 5 chapters of the site, STAGES 1 & 2 will be refresher content\u2026 So if you want, CLICK HERE to skip straight to STAGE 3. If you\u2019re still here, let\u2019s continue\u2026 STAGE 1: The \u201cBedroom\u201d Studio  While beginners always have that natural desire to want to learn everything, right away\u2026 The truth is\u2026you really only need a few items to get started. And anything more will probably just confuse you. So if you don\u2019t have a studio yet, a simple bedroom studio is the first milestone to aim for. And for a setup like this, you need the following 9 items: ComputerDAWAudio InterfaceMicrophonesHeadphonesStudio MonitorsCablesMicrophone StandsPop FilterNow let\u2019s look at each one in more detail\u2026 1. Computer  These days, since recording studios are almost ALL digital\u2026 The first thing you obviously need is a computer. And while you can just use any old computer, at-first\u2026 You should eventually invest in the best one you can afford. Because today\u2019s DAW\u2019s can be EXTREMELY hard on processing resources. And making full-use of its features requires a blazing-fast computer. So when you\u2019re ready to upgrade, here\u2019s what I recommend: The Best Computers/Laptops for Music Production 2017Classic Example: Macbook Pro \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF)2. Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)  The digital audio workstation is the primary software used to record, edit, and mix music on your computer. Originally designed to mimic look-and-feel of analog mixing boards from the pre-digital era\u2026 Their visual design has remained basically the same ever since. Pro Tools, which has long-been the most famous DAW, great for studios of all levels\u2026but it is by no means the only option. Depending on your budget and style of music, the best one for you could be any one of around 10 possible options. To learn more about each one, check out this article: The Ultimate Guide for DAW Software for 2017Classic Example: Avid Pro Tools \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)3. Audio Interface  Once you\u2019ve got the software, the next thing you\u2019ll need is an audio interface\u2026 Which has the primary purpose of providing all the necessary connections to send your music: INTO the computer when recording, and\u2026OUT the computer during playback.Originally, this was pretty much all they did\u2026 But today\u2019s modern interfaces have evolved into incorporate many other features as well. Those include: digital conversionmic preampsDI boxesheadphone ampsmonitor managementIn pro studios, each of these items normally exist as high-end stand-alone units, organized within a rack. In home studios though, these \u201call-in-one\u201d budget interfaces can be a great way to save money, and still get exactly what you need. To see which ones I recommend, check out this article: The Ultimate Guide to Audio Interfaces for 2017Classic Example: Focusrite Scarlett 2i4 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)4. Microphones  The oldest item on this list by far\u2026 Microphones have been around since long before recording studios ever existed. Yet ironically, in all those years, very little about them has changed. And many of the top models from a half-century ago are still among the industry standards of today. That\u2019s not to say that microphones are a simple topic, because it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. Recording studios typically carry several-dozen mics or more\u2026each one used to achieve: a different soundfrom different instrumentsin different situationsAnd in the following post, I give you the complete run-down on everything you should know about the topic: The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Recording Studio MicrophonesClassic Examples: Dynamic MicShure SM57 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)Large Diaphragm CondenserRode NT1A \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)Small Diaphragm CondenserAKG P170 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)5. Headphones  Unlike most studio gear, headphones are one item that we\u2019re all thoroughly familiar with. At least\u2026that\u2019s what most people assume. But truth is, while you may own a great pair of \u201cconsumer\u201d headphones\u2026 For pro audio, there are 2 special types of studio headphones intended for 2 very specific tasks: closed back headphonesopen back headphonesAnd in this post, I reveal what they are, what they do, and which ones I recommend: The Ultimate Guide to Studio Headphones for Home RecordingClassic Example: Sennheiser HD280 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)6. Studio Monitors  In the pro audio world, we call them either studio monitors, or nearfield monitors. And while they might look similar to plain old speakers\u2026THEY\u2019RE NOT. Compared to consumer speakers, which typically accentuate certain frequency bands in order to improve the listening experience for certain audiences\u2026 Studio monitors are designed with the opposite goal of providing a perfectly FLAT frequency response, so engineers can hear a mix as it truly is, flaws and all\u2026so they can adjust accordingly. In pro studios, these monitors can often cost 10 grand or more. But luckily for the rest of us, there are plenty of great affordable options as well. To see which ones I recommend, check out this article: The 10 Best Studio Monitors for Home RecordingClassic Example: KRK Rokit5 G3 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)7. Cables  In a typical pro studio, you\u2019re likely to find hundreds of cables\u2026 With dozens of connectors that you\u2019ve probably never even heard of. And the time will come when you own more cables than you can count. The good news is\u2026in the beginning, all you need is 3: One XLR cable to connect a mic to your audio interface.And two more to connect the interface to your monitors.For help finding these, check out this article: The Ultimate Guide to XLR Mic Cables for Stage and StudioClassic Example: Mogami Silver \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF)And to learn more about the other types of studio cables as well, check out this article: The Ultimate Guide to Audio Cables for Home Recording8. Microphone Stands  The same concept applies with microphone stands as with studio cables. Eventually you\u2019ll have many. But for now, all you need is 1 or 2. And while you might assume that all stands are pretty much the same\u2026 They actually come in many shapes and sizes, each designed for specific tasks. To learn more about each type and what they\u2019re for, check out this article: The Ultimate Guide to Microphone Stands for Stage and StudioClassic Example: DR Pro Boom \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF)9. Pop Filter  Despite the fact that pop filters are in no way \u201cessential\u201d to a bedroom studio\u2026 For some strange reason, all newbies seem to want one. And most probably don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re for. So let me explain\u2026 One peculiar fact about your mouth is that it expels a strong burst of air whenever you pronounce \u201cp\u201d or \u201cb\u201d sounds. In normal conversation, you don\u2019t even notice it. But when singing into a microphone, that blast of air is heard as a low frequency \u201cthump\u201d known as popping, which is both unpleasant to the ears, and unacceptable on a recording. Pop filters are designed to solve this problem by catching the blast of air before it hits the diaphragm of the mic. If you\u2019re interested in trying one out, here are the ones I recommend: The 7 Best Pop Filters for Recording VocalsClassic Example: Stedman Proscreen XL \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF)Now at this point, we\u2019ve concluded STAGE 1. Once you\u2019ve got everything we just covered, you should be fully equipped to record audio in your little bedroom studio. And while many people will be more than satisfied to remain at this stage\u2026some of you will want something better at some point. In which case, it\u2019s time to graduate to\u2026 STAGE 2: The Dedicated Home Studio  After recording music in a simple bedroom studio for a few months\u2026 You\u2019ll probably start to notice a few things that bug the crap out of you. Besides the fact that your workspace is extremely cramped\u2026 Your biggest problem is probably that all your music sounds like it was recorded\u2026well\u2026in a bedroom! And after doing some research to figure out what\u2019s going wrong\u2026 You will undoubtedly come to the conclusion that you now need a dedicated room for your studio\u2026 Where you can cultivate both a creative environment that will improve your workflow, and an acoustic environment that will allow your recordings to at least sound semi-decent. So when that time comes, here are the 8 KEY items you need: Desk/WorkstationStudio ChairsBass TrapsAcoustic PanelsDiffusersReflection FiltersMonitor Isolation PadsStudio Monitor StandsNow let\u2019s take a closer look at each one\u2026 1. Desk/Workstation  In virtually any home studio, regardless of size or purpose\u2026 The centerpiece of the room will undoubtedly be the desk. So it makes sense then, that it be the very first item you add to your new room. But don\u2019t go overboard here. Because in the beginning, any desk you already have in your house can work just fine. So you don\u2019t have to spend a fortune on a custom mixing desk if you don\u2019t want to. However\u2026 The truth is, at some point, you will want something better. And if that day is today, check out this post to see which ones I recommend: The 6 Best Studio Mixing Desks for Home RecordingClassic Example: Studio RTA Producer \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)2. Studio Chairs  Just like with your desk\u2026a high-end studio chair, while nice to have, is not a necessity. Truthfully, a folding chair works just fine. For a while\u2026 But home studios having a curious way of consuming your entire life\u2026 And it\u2019s quite possible that at some point, you will spend more hours in that chair than you do in your bed. In which case, a little bit of comfort and back support may not be a bad idea. So to see which ones I recommend, check out this post: The 6 Best Studio Chairs for Home Recording3. Bass Traps  The fact is\u2026that without some acoustic treatment in your room\u2026 Chances are slim-to-none that you will have any chance at recording decent sound. And the first type of acoustic treatment to add is\u2026bass traps. The reason they come first is because unlike other types of acoustic foam\u2026 Bass traps offer broadband absorption across the entire frequency spectrum, and are particularly good at absorbing lower frequencies\u2026which cause the majority of problems in any studio, especially in smaller rooms. And since it\u2019s the most-important item, it makes sense to check it off your list first. To learn more about bass traps, and see which ones I recommend, check out this post: The Ultimate Guide to Bass Traps for Home RecordingClassic Example: Auralex LENRD \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)4. Acoustic Panels  While they don\u2019t absorb bass frequencies very well\u2026 Acoustic panels are great at absorbing frequencies in the low-mid to high range. More importantly though\u2026 They are particularly good at taming standing waves\u2026 Which have a tendency to cause major acoustic problems in rooms with parallel walls, where sound reflections bounce back-and-forth in the same spot. In typical home studios, where the room is likely to be cubical, standing waves are especially problematic, which is why acoustic panels are a must-have. To see which ones I recommend, and how to put them up, check out this post: The Ultimate Guide to Acoustic Foam Panels for Home RecordingClassic Example: Auralex Studiofoam \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)5. Diffusers  The final item to add to add to your room is\u2026diffusers. In pro studios, with big budgets and big rooms\u2026 Diffusion is an important element of their acoustic treatment plan because creates a nice natural ambience without removing too much of the \u201cliveliness\u201d from the room. Diffusers do this by scattering whatever sound energy exists in the room\u2026 Allowing all frequencies to disperse randomly, rather than build up unnaturally in certain spots. Common wisdom states though, that diffusion is significantly less effective in smaller rooms. And since diffusers can get quite expensive, most home studios will elect to not use them. However, the choice is completely up to you. Classic Example: Auralex T\u2019Fusor \u2013 (Amazon/Thomann)6. Reflection Filters  While \u201creal\u201d acoustic treatment will always be ideal\u2026 Often times, it\u2019s simply too expensive for a small project studio. In which case, reflection filters offer a workable alternative. Intended mainly for vocal recording, this device allows you to skip the hassle of treating your entire studio\u2026 By instead capturing sound reflections before they ever enter the room. While noticeably less effective than \u201cproper\u201d acoustic treatment, they\u2019re still way better than nothing-at-all\u2026 And they can even be ideal for simple bedroom studios that only do vocals. To see which ones I recommend, check out this post: The 6 Best Reflection Filters for Recording VocalsClassic Example: sE Electronics Reflexion Filter PRO \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)7. Monitor Isolation Pads  Once you\u2019ve gotten the acoustic treatment part out of the way\u2026 You can still improve your sound one step further with monitor isolation pads. You see\u2026by placing your studio monitors directly on the desk, sound vibrations transfer through the surface of the desk\u2026 Which decreases the accuracy of the monitors themselves, and can even create new and unpredictable resonances from any other objects receiving those vibrations. Monitor isolations pads solve this problem by creating a buffer of acoustic isolation between your monitors and desk, preventing any vibration from transferring. Plus, some models even provide added options for positioning your monitors, by allowing you to tilt them at various angles. To see which ones I recommend, check out this article: The 6 Best Monitor Isolation Pads to Improve Your SoundClassic Example: Auralex Mopads \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)8. Studio Monitor Stands  To take monitor positioning one step further\u2026 A better option might be to use studio monitor stands instead. Because rather than limit your positioning to the surface of your desk\u2026 With stands\u2026distance, height, and angle are fully adjustable, so you can move them wherever you like. And they\u2019re a big help, because to get the most accurate sound from your monitors, they need to be in very specific locations in relation to your ears. To see a list of the top stands I recommend, check out this article: The 7 Best Studio Monitor Stands for Home RecordingClassic Example: Ultimate Support MS90 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)So that concludes STAGE 2. With the items we just covered, you should have a pretty awesome home studio by now. And if you only plan on working by yourself in your studio, this may be all you ever need. But when the day comes when you want to want to record other people, and possibly even charge them for your services, it\u2019s time to graduate to\u2026 STAGE 3: The \u201cSemi-Pro\u201d Studio  The biggest problem with the studio we just set up\u2026 Is that it only offers a limited number of input channels. What this means is\u2026it will be very difficult to record more than one person at a time\u2026 And you certainly can\u2019t record acoustic drums, which can easily require 8 or more mics depending on the size of the kit. A studio of this caliber is fine for yourself and maybe one other person, but anything more and you\u2019ll need some new gear. The other issue with our current studio is speed/efficiency\u2026 If you\u2019re recording a lot, or you expect to charge clients by the hour\u2026you should be able to work a relatively time-efficient manner. Which is harder to do without certain tools. So if you\u2019re ready\u2026let\u2019s begin with this new round of equipment: Rack MountPower ConditionerMicrophone PreampHeadphone AmpMonitor ManagementVirtual InstrumentsMIDI ControllerElectronic Drum KitControl SurfaceSoftware/PluginsSnake CableUninterruptible Power SupplyDirect BoxNow let\u2019s look at each one in more detail\u2026 1. Studio Rack Mounts  The final \u201cBIG milestone\u201d in the evolution of your home studio\u2026 Is the inevitable addition of your first rack-mounted setup. Because prior to this step, the simple desktop gear you\u2019ve been using can only record a small number of simultaneous tracks. And if you want to record bands (which most people eventually do) you need more channels. The beauty of the \u201crack system\u201d is\u2026it allows you to mix-n-match your equipment, so you can customize your routing and signal flow however you like. That way it can always do exactly what you need it to. Of course, the first step in building any rack to buy the case itself. So check out this article to see which ones I recommend: The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Studio Rack Mounts for Home RecordingClassic Example: Raxxess Economy Rack 2. Power Conditioner  While every person\u2019s rack setup will be entirely unique\u2026 The one item common to virtually every rack is a power conditioner. Because rather than having a half-dozen power cables sticking out the back of your rack from each unit\u2026 A power conditioner consolidates power for the entire rack down to a single cable. And as a HUGE side-benefit, it also filters the power using various technologies such as: surge protectionvoltage regulationnoise filtrationWhich extends the life of your gear, and allows it to always perform at its best. To see which ones I recommend, check out this post: The 7 Best Power Conditioners to Safeguard Your EquipmentClassic Example: Furman M-8\u00d72 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF)3. Microphone Preamp  Now that the rack and the power is taken care of\u2026 You\u2019re finally ready for those extra input channels we\u2019ve been talking about\u2026 Which you will get by adding a multi-channel microphone preamp to your setup. Another common variety of this device is the high-end single-channel mic preamp, which studios often use on vocals or any other particularly important track in a mix. To see which models I recommend for both single and multi-channel preamps, check out this article: The 9 Best Microphone Preamps for Home RecordingClassic Example: Presonus Digimax D8 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF)NOTE: Whenever buying a multi-channel preamp, you must also make sure that you audio interface has enough line inputs to accommodate the extra channels. If yours doesn\u2019t\u2026check out the audio interface post again to find one that does. 4. Headphone Amp  Once you have plenty of input channels to work with\u2026 The next thing you\u2019ll need is a few more OUTPUT channels. First, so that when you work with multiple musicians\u2026 Each person can monitor themselves as they perform. Since most audio interfaces have only 1-2 headphone outputs\u2026you\u2019ll need a headphone amp if you want more. Typical headphone amps offer stereo outs for anywhere from 4-8 sets of headphones. Advanced headphone amps\u2026can send multiple tracks of audio to personal mixers for each musician, allowing them to individually control exactly what they want to hear, without affecting what is heard by everyone else. And in studios that can afford one, this added functionality can make the entire recording process much easier for everyone involved. To see which ones I recommend, check out this article: The 7 Best Headphone Amps for Home RecordingClassic Example: Presonus HP4 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)5. Monitor Management  Now that you\u2019ve got plenty of output channels for headphones\u2026 The next thing you may want to add is some extra outputs for multiple studio monitors. And here\u2019s why: Sometimes in advanced studios, engineers need to compare how their mixes sound over a variety of playback devices. That way, when their work is heard through cheaper \u201cconsumer\u201d speakers\u2026 They can be confident that it sounds just as awesome as it does in the studio. To accomplish this task, a tool known as a monitor management system is used\u2026 Which allows engineers to switch back and forth between different speakers with the push of a button. If and when you ever need this in your studio, check out this article to see which ones I recommend: The 6 Best Monitor Management Systems for Home RecordingClassic Example: Mackie Big Knob \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)6. Virtual Instruments  If you record mainly by yourself\u2026 Then you already know how difficult it can be to play the part of \u201cmulti-instrumentalist\u201c. Not only do you have to be at least semi-proficient at a bunch of different instruments\u2026 You need to actually OWN each of those instruments as well. Which for many of us, is simply not possible. Home recording is expensive enough without having to buy a dozens of instruments as well. The solution to this common problem is of course\u2026virtual instruments. With a single software bundle, you get access to hundreds of instrument sounds for less than the price of a single \u201creal\u201d instrument. And while they can\u2019t replicate every instrument (like guitar), they can sound surprisingly realistic on certain instruments (such as piano and drums). Which is why for most people, what I recommend for starters is: one good drum program, and\u2026one good keyboard/synth program.And using just those two, you can accomplish a hell-of-a-lot. Classic Example for Drums: Toontrack EZ DrummerClassic Example for Keyboards: Spectrasonics Omnisphere7. MIDI Controller  The biggest problem with virtual instruments is\u2026 It SUCKS to play them on a computer keyboard and mouse. Not only is it no-fun\u2026 it takes forever to program even a simple rhythm/melody, and\u2026the level of \u201cfeel\u201d you can inject into a performance is minimal.Because to truly add your own expressive touch, you need an actual \u201cphysical\u201d instrument to control your \u201cvirtual\u201d instrument. And that\u2019s where MIDI controllers come in\u2026 While they aren\u2019t perfect, they allow for at least some degree of expression, by giving you something real to touch with your hands. To see which ones I recommend, check out this article: The 8 Best MIDI Controllers for Home RecordingClassic Example: M-Audio Axiom AIR mini \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)8. Electronic Drum Kit  While virtual instrument drums might be good enough for some\u2026 For drummers, probably not. The problem is\u2026while acoustic drums might be ideal, they simply aren\u2019t practical for 99% of home studios. But there\u2019s good news\u2026 Because electronic drum kits provide an excellent compromise between the \u201creal\u201d and the \u201cvirtual\u201c. Now if you haven\u2019t played one in a few years, you may have a negative opinion of them based off the ones you might remember back in the 80\u2019s. However, in the 20-30 years since, they\u2019ve gotten MUCH better. Today, they can sound almost as good, and in some cases even better than a real acoustic kit. And for the home recording musician, that\u2019s wonderful news. If you\u2019re interested, check out this article to see which ones I recommend: The 8 Best Electronic Drum Kits of 2017Classic Example: Roland TD11 KV \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)9. Control Surface  The stereotypical fantasy which initially sucks us into the world of recording is\u2026 that vision of you\u2026in the control room\u2026Crafting your latest masterpiece on the massive analog mixing board of your million dollar studio. Of course, it doesn\u2019t take long to discover that the actual world of home recording is far less glamourous. Because in this reality, mixing is usually done on a computer keyboard and mouse. Which to be honest\u2026kinda sucks. And not only does it look lame\u2026 More importantly, it slows down your workflow, and makes it much harder to perform some of the more advanced mixing techniques, such as automation. The solution to this problem is of course, a control surface, which is essentially a MIDI controller designed to mimic the look and feel of the analog boards from decades-past. Only\u2026in a much smaller package. And while they aren\u2019t a must-have item, they\u2019re still pretty awesome. To see which ones I recommend, check out this post: The 7 Best Control Surfaces for Home RecordingClassic Example: Avid Artist Mix \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)10. Software/Plugins  These days, virtually all DAW\u2019s offer a bundle of free software plugins as part of their package. And most of them aren\u2019t half bad. However, the fact is that top engineers will spend thousands of dollars on premium plugins\u2026 Which are somehow better than the free ones. And while beginners often make the mistake of believing that these premium plugins are a \u201cmagic pill\u201d that will solve all their problems\u2026 The truth is\u2026that if your skills aren\u2019t up to par, then no plugin in the world is gonna help. However\u2026 If you do have some skills, they can make a BIG difference. And I won\u2019t even have to explain how\u2026 Because you will hear it yourself. To learn more about the different categories of software plugins available, check out this post: The Ultimate Beginner\u2019s Guide to Music Production SoftwareClassic Example: Waves Gold Bundle \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)11. Snake Cables  At this stage in the game, with the gear you now own\u2026 It\u2019s quite likely that your studio is looking pretty cluttered. Cables everywhere\u2026right? Well once you reach this point, the standard solution to turn to is a snake cable like the one shown in the picture. By combining several individual cables into one, snake cables allow you to dramatically clean up the look of your studio, and more importantly\u2026 They keep your cables permanently organized, so never-again will you need to trace-back an entire length of cable through a tangled web just to find out where it leads. The only problem is\u2026most snakes are designed for much larger rigs than a typical home studio, and it can be difficult for beginners to find the right one for their purpose. So for more info on this topic, check out this article: The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Snake Cables for Home RecordingClassic Example: Hosa Little Bro 12. Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)  Do you know what can happen during a recording session when the power goes out? If your studio uses a desktop computer (instead of a laptop, which has batteries), and the computer SHUTS OFF improperly\u2026 All of your work can potentially be LOST. Which is why anytime a computer holds important data, it makes sense to use an uninturruptible power supply (UPS). Essentially functioning as a back-up battery, a UPS gives you several minutes of power to shut down your computer safely in the event of a blackout. Now unlike every other item on this list, which should be added in sequence\u2026a UPS is one of those items you can add at virtually any time. Some people get them early-on. Others never get them at all. But here\u2019s when I suggest you get one: Once you\u2019re at a point where you\u2019re creating work you\u2019re actually proud of, and that you\u2019d be devastated if you\u2019d lost\u2026 It makes sense to buy a little \u201cinsurance\u201d so you\u2019re protected.

Direct Boxes  In the studio, where cables sometimes extend as long as a hundred feet to reach their destinations\u2026 Guitar cables are especially susceptible to excessive signal noise. And direct boxes solve this problem by taking an (unbalanced) instrument level signal, and converting it to a (balanced) mic level signal\u2026 Which can then be sent for several hundreds of feet if necessary, while gathering virtually no noise at all. Because of the fact that most audio interfaces and microphone preamps have at least 1 or 2 direct box channels built-in\u2026 It\u2019s possible you may never need a direct box. However, if you need more DI inputs, or\u2026if would like to add a guitar jack to a new location in your room\u2026a stand-alone DI box could be exactly what you\u2019re looking for. To see which ones I recommend and why, check out this post: The Ultimate Guide to Direct Boxes for Stage and StudioClassic Example: Radial J48 \u2013 (Amazon/GuitarC/MusiciansF/Thomann)So we\u2019ve finally reached the end of STAGE 3. At this point with the new additions we just covered, your studio should be good enough to record bands and possibly even charge clients for your services. However\u2026 If you aspire to actually turn your hobby into something resembling a full-time career, there\u2019s still one more set of upgrades that remain\u2026 STAGE 4: The \u201cPro\u201d Studio  For 99.9% of us, STAGE 3 will have been the final level of our journey. Because the truth is\u2026it\u2019s extremely tough to be successful in the pro audio business. And most of us aren\u2019t really looking to be professionals anyway. But since many of you are at least curious about it, I might as well give you a few examples of how pro studios differ from amateur ones. So if you\u2019re ready, here\u2019s the final list of equipment for STAGE 4: Digital ConvertersMaster ClocksAnalog HardwareAnd here\u2019s more about each one\u2026 1. Digital Converters  Hidden within your audio interface, and many other devices in your studio\u2026 Is a device known as a digital converter, that has 2 simple jobs: converting analog audio into digital (A/D), and\u2026converting digital audio into analog (D/A).The reason you may not have heard of it is\u2026in 99% of cases, digital converters exist as a side-feature within some other device. However\u2026 In pro studios with big budgets, it\u2019s common to find high-end stand-alone digital converters costing several thousand dollars each\u2026 Which have no other function than to deliver the absolute best digital conversion money can buy. Will it be the difference between a good mix and a bad one? Probably not. But for professionals, every little advantage counts. Classic Example: Lynx Aurora2. Master Clocks  Another little-known device hidden within virtually every digital recording device is\u2026 The master clock (aka word clock, aka digital clock). Whenever you connect digital signals from two or more devices\u2026 The individual digital \u201csamples\u201d must align perfectly in sync. Otherwise the resulting audio will be filled with annoying \u201cclicks\u201d and \u201cpops\u201d from the misaligned samples. In most setups, the audio interface clock defaults as the master, and the others as slaves. Meaning one clock leads, and the others follow. However with more complex systems, it\u2019s much easier to use a stand-alone digital master clock to lead the entire system. And while there\u2019s much debate about their impact on sound quality, some sources will tell you that a high-end master clock makes a noticeable difference. Classic Example: Apogee Big Ben3. Analog Hardware  Long before the days when mixing was done with software plugins\u2026 Common tools like EQ and compression existed only as stand-alone hardware in a rack. These days many of those units cost several thousand dollars each, and offer only 1 or 2 channels. Classic Example: Universal Audio LA-2ANow you might be wondering\u2026 So wouldn\u2019t I need dozens of those things just to mix a song? Well the answer is\u2026yes you would. Luckily for us, we now live in an age where the modeled \u201cdigital versions\u201d of these tools make our jobs both cheaper and easier\u2026 Yet surprisingly\u2026 Many of the world\u2019s top studios still rely mainly on these ancient tools to get the job done. Because according to many of the best ears in the business\u2026analog gear still sounds better than any plugin. As such, many of us \u201cnormal\u201d guys blow absurd amounts of cash on a single purchase that may (but probably won\u2019t) be that one missing ingredient we\u2019ve been searching for. Would I recommend it in most cases? Not really. But I promise I won\u2019t judge you if you buy one anyway. Anything else? Now obviously, there\u2019s way more to a pro studio than just these 3 additional items. In fact, much of what makes a recording studio \u201cprofessional\u201d has more to do with the rooms themselves than the actual gear. But all that stuff is pretty far outside the scope of both this article and this website. So for now at least, that will conclude this insanely long post. Hope you enjoyed it.

            "answer_text": " Starting a recording studio today has never been easier. You don't need expensive high-tech equipment like the one you see in the movies. If you have a minimal budget you can set-up a basic recording studio and operate it from the comfort of your home. The objective here is to capture high-quality recordings. When the final product is completed the average person cannot (and should not) tell whether the material was recorded in a home or a professional recording studio. In no particular order, let\u2019s go through a list of some of the basic tools-of-trade you need to get started. 1. Personal Computer or Laptop You need a computer/laptop or Mac. Any one of those will do 2. Audio Interface An audio interface is a must. This piece of hardware is also referred to as a sound card or external sound card to be exact. 3. A Good Microphone To say that you need a good microphone sounds vague, I know. A condenser microphone is what I'm referring to. This mic requires 48 Voltage and it comes highly recommended for studio recordings. 4. Monitors Monitors or monitor speakers are required for playback. You need to hear sound that's coming from your PC. Now this is just a basic summary of what you need to get started. There are different ways to set-up a basic recording studio. If you are a complete novice, I would recommend that you read further so you can get a better insight. ",
