            "answer_text": "Between 1958 and 1976, the most prestigious certification awarded to a best-selling album was the Gold Record. To get one of those to hang on your mansion wall, you\u2019d have to achieve a total of 1,000,000 dollars in domestic retail sales. However, as music sales gradually increased over the decades, and the focus shifted from profits to actual units sold, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) eventually decided to introduce a new certification: The Platinum Record! This attractive award later evolved to take on even more impressive names such as the Multi-Platinum Award and the Diamond Award, but in 1976, being awarded a Platinum disc mean that you had to sell either 1,000,000 albums or 2,000,000 singles. And the first artist to manage this feat and consequently be bestowed with the new Platinum prize, were Eagles. Which they did with this bad boy: Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975)  And quite well-deserved it was as well, because as it turned out, this album ultimately became the best-selling album of the 20th century in America, selling in excess of 38 million copies and spending 239 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart (so far). And not only was it the first Platinum record, but if you include online sales and streams, it\u2019s actually been awarded the Platinum certification 38 times! Furthermore, it remained the best-selling album in America until the death of Michael Jackson rocketed his \u201cThriller\u201d album to the top spot in 2009! But ever tenacious, the Eagles and their Greatest Hits returned to reclaim their crown only 9 years later in 2018. Worldwide, the album also proved to be a monstrous success.Selling another 4 million copies for a total of 42 million, the album today has the distinction of being the 6th best-selling album of all time, as well as the best-selling greatest hits album of all time. Give it a spin if you haven\u2019t heard it. It\u2019s a killer album without a second of filler on it.And if you like what you hear, I\u2019d suggest you also give the rest of the band\u2019s discography a listen. ",
