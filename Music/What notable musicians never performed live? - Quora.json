Oldfield had never performed in front of an audience and was extremely reluctant to do so. Eventually a string of renowned musicians was put together to record a live performance for the BBC. Driving to the studio in Branson\u2019s Bentley Oldfield has a panic attack and in order to induce him to carry on with the performance Branson promised he would give him the Bentley. ",

I may have seen him - there was a guest singer the time I saw them, and he looked like Nilsson, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s who it was. EDIT: Actually, he did a few live performances, mostly in Europe. But he didn\u2019t like playing live, and only did so because his manager urged him to. ",
