            "answer_text": "Sheer volume in singing is actually a negative rather than something to aspire to. Instead you should focus on correct frequency and resonance production instead - after all, it\u2019s quite impossible to sing over a 100 watt Marshall guitar amp, but it IS possible to sing with frequencies that aren\u2019t competing for the same space like I suspect you\u2019re trying to do. Correct resonance production comes from a great foundation of diaphragmatic breathing, placement and balancing your onsets properly for a powerful but strain free tone. When you\u2019ve developed your range properly using the MIX register coordination and you learn how to tune and \u201cEQ\u201d your resonance by altering the resonant space and width of your vocal tract, you can then start developing a touch of twang to your singing voice so you can boost your higher frequencies to \u201ccut\u201d through a live or recording situation (your recording engineer will thank you!). Twang itself doesn\u2019t occur from your vowel pronunciation like you think and is altogether separate to \u2018country twang\u2019 or \u2018nashville drawl\u2019, and actually occurs from a subtle narrowing of the epiglottis, allowing you to make your actual vocal tract resonate instead of your standard resonators - resulting in a slight 3k frequency boost that just slays any form of \u2018volume\u2019 competition you\u2019re currently trying for. The most common issue with volume in speech is speakers believing that volume comes from their consonants and onsets - your speaking voice, while a different application and process to singing, still occurs from coordination of the same mechanism as singing and requires resonance and sustained vibration to resound your tone. While your vowel production in speech will be somewhat different to singing depending on your accent and voice type, you still need to speak with a bright and sustained resonance in your tone so that you\u2019re not abusing your voice, and hence your voice is loud and confident. Confidence in itself is a separate matter, but is pretty easy to build in a speaking or singing voice with this simple process: Identify your anxiety/fears, Acknowledge that they are there, Develop and approach to remove the intangible. Quite simply, try to work out where your lack of confidence and fears come from, acknowledge that these fears are/aren\u2019t a possibility in reality, and then form an approach to ensure they simply cannot happen - a great way to do this in a live singing situation is to warm up in the exact same space that you will be singing in front of people, and for public speaking doing a run through of your speech with the house lights on and standing in front of the podium is a great way to remove the \u201cblind\u201d aspect of walking out onto stage not knowing what awaits - this is the root of many singers and public speaker\u2019s fears. In short, for either singing or speech, you need to develop better control and understanding of your vocal mechanism so that you can resonate with power and confidence without straining. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some old theatrical tricks. When you want that your speech/shout was delivered right, address it intuitively to the space above heads. Loud voice - besides power in it - is the art of using intonation. Try to play with intonation contour, lower start and raise up ending. If you want tell something loudly - speak quietly with falcetto. Besides that, you could go to the forest and shout there 10\u201315 min per day. That is enough to make your voice stronger. ",
