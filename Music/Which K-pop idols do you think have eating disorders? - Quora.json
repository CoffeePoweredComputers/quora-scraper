            "answer_text": "Honestly, I can't answer this question with 100% accuracy if I just base on what I see, since being or getting thin can all depend on stress, genes, age, or proper diet. So, I'll just tell you all the kpop idols who have confessed to having eating disorders. IU She often mentions she had bulimia in the past. She fist said it on an episode of Healing camp, wherein she said that the stress and pressure around her debut lead her to binge eat and in turn be overly anxious on her weight and ended up throwing it all up. Of course, she's now recovered. 2. Former Oh My Girl's JinE  After her group's debut, she in particular received harsh comments about her chubbiness. While all the members underwent diets, she took things too far and got sent to the hospital only to be diagnosed with anorexia. She then quit the group in order to look after herself better. Now, she constantly posts pictures so people can see that she is indeed doing better. 3. Jang Na Ra  This is another girl who's opened up in an episode of Healing Camp. She revealed that she had bulimia due to all the pressure as well as extreme anxiety. Now, she's recovered after spending some time with her parents and undergoing counseling. 4. Ladies' Code Sojung  She opened up during an episode of JBTC's Girl Spirit, telling everyone her battle with anorexia even before their debut. Her lowest point was 84 pounds which was incredibly unhealthy. Now, she's eating and exercising regularly to achieve a more healthy lifestyle. 5. Seo In Guk This idol opened up about his bulimia during an episode of YTN's News and Issues-Issues and People. He first auditioned for JYP, where he was told that he needed to drop a few pounds. From there, he obsessed over his weight and vomited after every meal in hopes of achieving a lower number. When he though he lost enough, he auditioned again but got rejected because his vocal cords got damaged from all the vomiting. The good news, the rejection drove him to change his lifestyle for the better. He won Superstar K program and is now the confident, talented singer and actor we all know and love.  (Can't find any pictures of him before so just admire this after. Damn boi) Of course, there's a whole lot more. And I'm 100% sure some idols have eating disorders as of this moment. It's not just in Korea, but the whole world. Right as you're reading this, a person may just be throwing up their last meal over a toilet bowl in hopes to get thinner. This post just proves the notion that Korean beauty standards are very harsh. Harsh to the point where a lot of the people, even the people not in entertainment industries drive themselves to get thinner just to get that ideal body, even if the ways they do it may damage their health.

He said, \u201cI\u2019ve tried weight control in many ways. I\u2019m not sure if you remember me from \u2018Growl\u2019 days. I was skinny at that time. At that time, I weighed no more than 53kg. I didn\u2019t eat to lose weight. I ate a full meal once in two days. I always drank coffee, and I didn\u2019t eat to lose weight. That was how I completed promotion for \u2018Growl\u2019.\u201d A full meal once in two days omfg. Glad to see he's gained the weight back, a healthy Xiumin equates to happy EXO-L.

I understand it\u2019s from a place of genuine love and concern, but it is SO inappropriate and invasive. (TW; anorexia story, ends after the //) we as fans need to stop doing this, stop making assumptions about our idol\u2019s lives and behaviors and mental states from the most limited data set. my sister is really skinny. she got asked constantly as a child if she had an eating disorder, so many \u201cconcerned\u201d parents approached my mother that they were worried she was anorexic bc they could see her bones. as a result, my sister would eat everything she could all the time, as publicly as possible. being the girl with the huge appetite became her identity, so people would stop assuming things about her relationship with food. i actually had an eating disorder. for like, 5+ years. and absolutely no one noticed. i was good at hiding it, i knew the things to say and do to keep people in the dark and could literally go days without eating while everyone around me had no clue. i can\u2019t emphasize this enough, no one was even suspicious. // external behaviors mean NOTHING. no one, NO ONE, besides the person themselves (or maybe their therapist) knows anything about their mental state. we should gratefully accept the pieces of that they choose to share with us, like Jimin talking about struggling with diets or other idols discussing their own mental health, WITHOUT extrapolating and running with that. we don\u2019t actually know if jimin, or any idol, has an eating disorder unless they tell us in explicit terms. and if they did? i can GUARAN-FUCKING-TEE that knowing thousands of people were talking about it and speculating on it and picking apart pictures of their bodies to see if they were skinny enough to have an eating disorder would make it ten thousand percent worse. If you speculate on this publicly, you are actively harming the people you talk about, not to mention romanticizing eating disorders when you use it as a piece of backstory to prove how much your idols have \u201covercome.\u201d TL; DR; Coming from a recovered anorexic; YOU CANNOT KNOW UNLESS THEY TELL YOU, TALKING ABOUT IT HARMS THEM, AND IT IS SO DEEPLY NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

That\u2019s so incredibly sad to think about because if you look back on it he actually looked quite skinny already. It\u2019s sad to think that idols actually have this mental image of what they need to look like in their mind, honestly, how skinny can one person get? Jimin has said that he doesn\u2019t suffer from this disorder anymore or has at least gotten better, which is great! I just hope idols don\u2019t have to feel that they have to be a pile of bones in the future, even though not eating in this industry is incredibly common. I imagine many idols suffer from various eating disorders though. I hope they get better like Jimin did.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the invitation to answer this question. I\u2019ll answer it well and truthfully. Not I think, but do. One female K-Pop idol from a very popular girls group consisting of four girls has an eating disorder that isn't yet publicised. Since it still remains as a private affair I cannot mention her name but she has a beautiful voice. Due to her eating disorder she occasionally appears to be puffy due to fluid retention and swollen in the face due to irritated glands. In fact, it is very common in the entertainment/modelling/fashion industry to have an eating disorder. Even if the person doesn't suffer from an eating disorder they would suffer from disordered eating. If you find this answer helpful then please hit the \u2018Upvote\u2019 button. ",

            "answer_text": "I honestly don\u2019t know which ones have eating disorders as that is all kept very under wraps but I\u2019m sure a large number of them do have eating disorders just because of the huge pressure put on them to be skinny and maintain a certain weight. If you look at Blackpink Rose, she is very skinny and has become even skinnier (look at the recent performances in America). Now, I\u2019m not sure if this is due to more dieting or stress which causes her to lose more weight, but many idols are also naturally skinny so you can never be too sure which ones actually have an eating disorder. Hope that helped!! ",
