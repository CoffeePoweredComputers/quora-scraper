Kaafi Hai, Kaafi Hai That is enough Hawaaon se jo Manga hissa mera When I asked the winds for my share  To badle mein hawa ne saans di Instead it gave me breath  Akelepan Se Chhedi Jab Guftagoo When I started a conversation with loneliness Mere Dil Ne Awaaz Di Instead my heart talked to me  Mere Haathon Hua Jo Kissa Shuru The events which were started by me Use Pura To Karna Hai Mujhe It has to be completed by me  Qabar Par Mere Sar Utha Kar Khadi Ho Zindagi, Aise Marna Hai Mujhe... Life proudly stands on my grave.. I want to die such a death Kuchh Maangna Baaki Nahi  There's nothing more to ask Jitna Mila Kaafi Hai... Whatever I have received, it's enough Zinda Hoon Yaar Kaafi Hai... I am alive friend and that is enough Mujhe Chhod Do...

            "answer_text": "I think Pratibha has done a good job translating the song. I\u2019ll avoid doing the same and focus on one interpretation instead. My interpretation of this song; in particular if you take it out of context from the movie itself and treat it as an independent work of art; is that this song is about life itself and its origin in a cosmos that doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s how life was born the very first time out of sheer chance and sustained itself against all odds. It\u2019s about the fight to survive in a universe bereft of any other life; being alive alone is an achievement in in-of itself. The most beautiful bits in this song include the stanza below: Hawaaon se jo Manga hissa mera To badle mein hawa ne saans di Akelepan Se Chhedi Jab Guftagoo Mere Dil Ne Awaaz Di Mere Haathon Hua Jo Kissa Shuru Use Pura To Karna Hai Mujhe Qabar Par Mere Sar Utha Kar Khadi Ho Zindagi, Aise Marna Hai Mujhe... My interpretation is of life taking hold of it\u2019s first breath as your right from the raw forces of nature (Hawaaon se\u2026). Next is about being able to replicate cells (Akelepan se\u2026 ) and finally about the tree of life itself (Mere haathon hua\u2026 ). It\u2019s about knowing that this life is going to be done but at the same time being aware of having started something much bigger than itself and that life will live on(Qabar par mere.. ). I find this song very beautiful and uplifting. I hope you find my interpretation interesting. ",
