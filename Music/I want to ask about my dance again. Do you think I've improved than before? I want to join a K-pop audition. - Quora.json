            "answer_text": "ok well shit YOU IMPROVED SO MUCH OKAY srsly I don\u2019t compliment people like this but ok, here we go: Things you improved on: Control! It\u2019s much better. I see that you\u2019ve also gotten better at controlling space, too. :DEnergy: Also much better. There were a couple issues with excess energy that really made the dance look rough. Now that it\u2019s a bit more polished, your dance is much better!Just everything in general was so much better. I can tell you really worked hard on dancing. The dance is also more on beat too.Bonus: Expressions- You really look like you enjoy dancing, and that makes me feel good too! The confidence is also there. There are definitely still some places you would need to improve on, but the stage presence part is good. Stage presence isn\u2019t a skill, there are people who have it, and people who don\u2019t. You have it.Things you need to improve more on: More control. The beginning was still a bit chaotic. Don\u2019t put too much control and strain your dance though, that wouldn\u2019t look good either. It was much better later on in the dance.This choreo is very energetic. You\u2019ll need to practice some other dances to be even more versatile. Slower dances like Got7\u2019s You Calling My Name, silly dances like Got7\u2019s Just Right, etc. I suggest that you could take a look at this Stray Kids\u2019 predebut dance, they are very versatile in expressions and dance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DxPSenoloDetails. First, work on the perfect control. There are points in the dance where you can let your energy loose and places where you need to be extremely detailed. From 0:09\u20130:17 (in your dance) are places they require a lot of detail. The other spots, you can let loose your energy but: cOnTrOl-Yes, and I think that\u2019s it. If you have any questions, feel free to dm me! :D",

            "answer_text": "I don't think I have seen your previous video before , so I wouldn't know if you have improved on it, but I will provide your feedback on this dance video. You oversell, have a good technique, and have stability while dancing. you know how to exert strength, in certain moves, and also when to transition to fluid and graceful, when it is appropriate, which I think is important when trying to communicate your emotions. I think that is also another thing, your emotions. you showed solid facial expressions that really helped to enhance the quality of your dance, and to show the mood of the song, which was upbeat and catchy. I can see your passion and dedication, and I think people will recognize that too. However, if there is one thing I must critique, you on, it is that you moves seems a bit unstable, and your footing is a bit unrefined, I think what you need to focus on is finding balance in your steps you are light on your feet, but you also need to land the moves sharply, so you can make an impact. Although there were some parts, where you executed the dance moves, perfectly, you balance wavered as you moved on to the next step, and I think if you could straighten out a bit more, and make some adjustments on your moves and the execution, and making sure that you don't use too much energy all at one in a move, to avoid faltering or coming off as a bit untidy in your moves I think knowing how far you can exert your power and strength is important. I think while it is good to put your best effort in, there is also over dancing your moves, where you over exaggerate them, and just make it seem too dramatic, or that you are trying too hard. You want to look professional and well polished, and I think that you put too much power in some steps, that it just looks like you are trying so hard, and I think people would want you to just give the right amount of energy so, you could give people the impression that you are professional. I also notice that you don\u2019t seem very confident in your skills, and that dancing seems to be an outlet, for you to let go of those nerves and worries, and I can see that you have passion for it, that you put into your dance, but I think that maybe, you are not as confident, that you might think you need to give all of your energy to it, to try to seem confident I think just dance as comfortably as you can, and matin it throughout so, you can find the balance your steps, and make them look crisp and sharp. But I think overall, you are really great and I can tell that dancing is just something you truly love to do and are passionate and I support you on that, I love how you hold so much love and admiration for it, and people can see that through your dance. You really brought a smile on my face. So, just try to be more confident because you are very good at dancing, but often just over exaggerate your moves, that your moves are just a bit unrefined, and all you need to do it is to make sure you try to execute those moves precisely, and make them sharp. I know you can do it, and I hope you can succeed. ",
