            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always dedicated this song to my first crush\u2014- after getting over him, of course. \u201cI Wouldn\u2019t Know\u201d by Justifide. And the best part was I could say that and nobody would even be the wiser to the fact that I had a crush if they\u2019d never heard the song. The nonwiser would just assume I said that because \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know\u201d what it was like to have a crush. But alas, not true! The song is actually rather fitting to my situation because, like the song says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what love is if I didn\u2019t give my heart away to you. But now I know, now I know, now I know.\u201d And now I know it more intensely due to my newest crush. It is ongoing. I haven\u2019t seen the guy in a month and I miss him terribly. I have no song in mind that really fits all that well, but some do remind me of him nonetheless. I always used to sing \u201cTelepathetic\u201d by Voicians when he was on my mind while I worked during lunch at college. The first two verses and the chorus anyway. It just expresses how dedicated I become to a person I want to let into my life. Right now I trust him not to encroach upon the territory of the third and final verse. More recently I\u2019ve associated the situation more with \u201cThe Art of Breaking\u201d by Thousand Foot Krutch, as well as another song by TFK, \u201cComplicate You\u201d. Art of Breaking more expresses my dedication, and Complicate You is more how I feel about meeting him and how I value his individuality. XD \u201cI think you took me by surprise, the way you made me feel inside. It was more than just a moment shared, like something else was in the air. I\u2019ve never felt this way before, not since\u2014- ever since\u2014- you walked through that door.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "song 3 by stone sour If you take a step towards me You will take my breath away So I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe No one else has ever loved me No one else has ever tried I never understood how much I could take Then I saw the worst was over When I laid my eyes on you It was all that I could do to know my place Out of all the vast illusions Out of all the dreams come true I was gone until I finally saw your face If you cried out for more If you reached out for me I would run into the storm 0Just to keep you here with me I have gone beyond my years I've wasted half my life But I found it all in you Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too Let me take a step towards you Let me feel you in my hands Let me cross this line and show you where it leads There's a darkness down inside me That I know we'll both enjoy And it's screaming from within to set it free I have left this bloody nightmare In my wake but out of sight All I want is deviation by design Out of all the past confusion Out of all the common spite Just tell me I am yours 'cause you are mine And if you cried out for more If you reached out for me I would run into the storm Just to keep you here with me I have gone beyond my years I've wasted half my life But I found it all in you Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too It doesn't really matter what you do or say I'm never going anywhere anyway 'Cause when I'm dying for you I've never felt so alive If you cried out for more If you reached out for me I would run into the storm Just to keep you here with me I have gone beyond my years I've wasted half my life But I found it all in you Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too I know you saved me too this song is copyrighted by stone sour 2017 ",
