            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t difficult to find sheet music. But why must it be free? What you should be doing is paying for it so the band/artist will benefit. They get a royalty from your purchase. That royalty helps them continue to create the music you love. You wouldn\u2019t give away something you created and monetized. Why should they? Just pony up the five bucks (sheetmusic.com; musicnotes.com, etc\u2026) and support the writers in their craft. ",
