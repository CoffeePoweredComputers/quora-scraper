How can I understand the deep meanings of classical music and enjoy them?\u201d I don\u2019t code, but I\u2019d like to have a deep appreciation for software architecture. How can I design a truly kick-ass app? In other words, the answer to your question is simple, and probably not what you want to hear. You can enjoy classical music without having any context at all, but to find the deeper meaning you have to understand the context of the music. And that requires time and effort. Sometimes you get a long way just through experience \u2014 a lot of listening. This is what Ed Givelberg lays out very well (though I disagree with his last sentence). You can refine your own taste through exposure, and even though you can\u2019t articulate what you do and don\u2019t like about something, at least you\u2019ll know. But once you understand the vocabulary (of anything; of music, art, math, science) you unlock the ability to understand more, faster, and with more depth than you could\u2019ve otherwise. There aren\u2019t any shortcuts, but just wanting more exposure allows you to go to concerts with experienced friends, and then they can joyfully explain what they heard and why they liked it or not, while you listen. You can think about whether you agree, disagree, or whether what they heard wasn\u2019t even something you noticed (yet). ",

            "answer_text": "Start with music pieces and performances that you like. Try to find out other pieces by the same composer or by the same performers. After some time you will start noticing that the same piece of music can be performed in a way that excites you or in a way that you don't like.Occasionally you will discover that music pieces that you thought were uninteresting become interesting when you listen to new performances.After a while you will find patterns in the music that you like and you will start discerning the kind of performances that you like. Then you will start appreciating technique and structure. It will come slowly and gradually. You will find people whose opinions are close to yours and they may point you to some music that you may like, but generally you should disregard their opinion. Listen by yourself, and if you like it -- it is great. If you don't -- it isn't, or may be you will come to like it a few years from now. Don't worry about \"depth\", \"theory\" or what the critics say. They often say a lot of nonsense. ",
