            "answer_text": "Ok I\u2019m a professional singer and have been for many years. I\u2019ve always had vibrato. Even as a kid I had a weirdly dark voice with vibrato. Turns out, I learned in college for music, that a healthy sound has vibrato naturally. You don\u2019t manufacture it. It\u2019s just there. And to answer your question I don\u2019t feel it. If I do, it\u2019s too wide, and it\u2019s a wobble. If it feels to me like straight tone, it has the proper spinny vibrato. To sing actual straight tone is very difficult for me and I\u2019m not sure I can even do it. It takes a lot of effort and weird tension I\u2019m not sure is healthy, so I only use actual straight tone on like a single held note in baroque music or something when I particularly want that sort of whiny sound.
