            "answer_text": "This is completely dependent upon the species and male/female determination and specific properties of that species in respect to song between males and females of that species. It can get complicated real fast. For instance, at the extreme range: The Zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata):  By Peripitus - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, File:Taeniopygia guttata - front view - dundee wildlife park.jpg Female zebra finches don't sing but make one-note, low-pitch calls. Males sing over a wide range of frequencies. University of Utah scientists discovered how: The males' stronger vocal muscles, not the pressure of air flowing through their lungs, lets them sing from the B note above middle C all the way to a whistle beyond the high end of a piano keyboard. Putting muscle into birdsong: Wide range of pitch is due to vocal muscles more than air pressure That\u2019s approximately 6 octaves of sound, but it goes into an octave above the high end of the piano. There is a paper analyzing the exact notes. It is important to understand that this is not a piano, so birds do not always hit every sharp note in every octave that they sing in. They sing in harmonics, so the notes they sing in, regardless of the octave, fit together well to attract a member of the opposite sex male/female. https://biology.williams.edu/files/2013/05/WilliamsCynxNottebohm89.pdf#:~:text=Results%20Fundamental%20Frequencies%2C%20Harmonics%2C%20and%20Timbre%20in%20Zebra,had%20fundamental%20frequencies%20between%20500%20and%20700%20Hz. In results you will find this: The fundamental frequencies of the 69 notes analyzed in this study ranged from a minimum of 410 Hz to a maximum of 2030 Hz. However, the majority of syllables (74%) had fundamental frequencies between 500 and 700 Hz So you can see, although the sound reaches to 2030Hz, nearly 75% of the song remains between 500 and 700Hz. Therefore the zebra finch is not filling out all the octaves, obviously. What the male is doing is adding a higher note harmonic to the lower frequencies to compliment his song. They found direct evidence of 2nd harmonic series, but could not find measurable evidence of 3rd through 8th harmonic series. Now that\u2019s just the Zebra Finch. You would have to do a similar frequency analysis of every species of bird on the planet. We believe there to be roughly between 9,000 and 10,000 bird species on the planet, in the subcategory of songbirds you can cut that down to approximately 4,000 species plus or minus. So\u2026 exactly how long of an answer do you really want to not read? ",
