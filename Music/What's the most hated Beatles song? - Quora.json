            "answer_text": "I doubt there is a Beatles song that is widely \u2018hated\u2019. As already stated, hate is a powerful emotion and is perhaps the wrong choice of word. However, one song that went close with me when it was released was The Ballad of John and Yoko. It was more the title of the song. I thought WTF, but this is The Beatles! At the time I felt angry because Yoko\u2019s infestation of The Beatles had led to an almost sacrilegious like bastardisation of their specialness. She was the intruder whose presence had gone much too far. And like others I thought she had brainwashed John. Ironically, I now rather enjoy the lyrics because they provide a nostalgic reminder of a very special era. But the title still enrages me at times. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHated\u201d is a very strong word about something as insignificant as a song! There are a bunch of songs that a lot of Beatles \u201cfans\u201d really don\u2019t like but Hated? No. If you hate a song that a bit extreme. Tracks that a majority of Beatles fans don\u2019t like include \u201cRevolution 9\u201c, \u201cMr Moonlight\u201d , \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u201d and \u201cWild Honey Pie\u201d, but even then there will be someone who likes the track. But \u201chated?\u201d no!. I\u2019m sorry but if someone has a track that they \u201chate\u201d then they really should get a life! If you dislike the track so much then do as I do. Press the skip button! ",
