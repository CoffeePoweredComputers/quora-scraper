            "answer_text": "A little scatterbrained here, really sorry, didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have this much to say but bear with me - I make a living as a musician and I\u2019ll get to that. It\u2019s easier than you think! The general feeling is that it\u2019s too hard, there\u2019s millions of people trying it and they aren\u2019t succeeding, musicians never make any money\u2026.correct! Musicians without any business sense don\u2019t! And most of them don\u2019t have any business sense! A lot of them don\u2019t even want it. Seriously, how many guitarists do you know who are really good AND into networking? I know maybe 3 out of 50. 2 of them are actually \u201ckind of shitty,\u201d to quote a viewer, but their networking, marketing, and overall business sense has helped them immensely. They aren\u2019t famous, and probably never will be. But they make a living as musicians. Fear of success\u2026.a sax player told me I had that, as did a very unique construction worker I interviewed, and I never understood it. What they mean is, you\u2019re comfortable now, working your office job. But you want to be a musician. You\u2019re afraid you will succeed. Why would I be afraid of success? Because if you succeed, everything will change. Your whole life. You know you have the skills and the passion, but you have to take the leap and ditch everything else, because if you really want it, it deserves as much time as that office job. Likely more. It\u2019ll be really hard in the beginning, also scary, and part of the path to success. If you put that much effort into it, what could go wrong? Give it a few years, 5, 10 even - the office will always be there if you need it. Unfortunately the men who told me this claimed they were already too far - old, I\u2019m debt, with children. Idk if that applies to everyone of age and with kids, but being young and childless certainly made taking the leap a lot less burdensome; lack of money wouldn\u2019t cause too many problems at that point in my life. I make a living as a musician! I mostly teach but I also perform studio work, gig, help run music venues, try to sell beats and jingles, transcribe and transpose for clients who haven\u2019t figured that out yet, and have several albums out there slooooooooooooooooowly making money. I think it\u2019s just as likely as any job! Any job that you are passionate about enough to work really hard! You can\u2019t make a living doing anything if you don\u2019t work really hard at it. The big stars we see still work very hard, or at least did at some point, likely for a while. They can also fall. Part of the answer depends on your definition of \u201ca living\u201d and the quality of life your looking for. I can\u2019t afford a mansion, and I don\u2019t want to spend my money on a Mercedes, but I will be buying a house in the next three or so years! I\u2019ve been working hard at being a musician for 25 years, and I turn 30 in June. I just started \u201cmaking a living,\u201d really only about 2 years ago, and had been trying to do that for about 5\u20138 years on my own. If I worked harder I think I could have done it in two years but, other life things stole my focus! It\u2019s no 6-figures, but A) that\u2019s not what I need to be happy mand B) I\u2019ll get there! I read a really old-school book called \u201c\u201cmaking money making music\u201d - it\u2019s dated, but every one of the concepts can still apply to today\u2019s world. I. Fact that book is where I learned how to drum up gigs, fast. Check it out, super fast read. ",

            "answer_text": "By way of background, I\u2019m not a pro musician myself, but know many talented folks that have attempted to make a living and have an idea of what venues pay to acts. First, if you mean getting paid jobs such as gigs, session work etc., this is unlikely to make a living unless you are willing to move to where the work is and be very flexible and professional. If you are a live performer promoting your own band, you are unlikely to break even after costs let alone make a living. You may make money in tribute acts or function bands. You will likely be needing to play 5 times per week or more to scrape by. The more reliable you are, the more gigs you will get. Over many years the calls will come in and you will be able to charge more for your services. Or perhaps you get a job playing in a theater production where you are playing 14 shows per week. Either way, its hard, hard work. You have to have a tough skin and turn down poor paying jobs even when you are desperate. Of course, other income streams such as teaching can still give musicians satisfaction and can help supplement living costs. ",
