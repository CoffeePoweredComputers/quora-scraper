            "answer_text": "While Bieber isn't responsible for the bulk of his songs, he is generally involved somewhat in the lyrics. However, even the lyrics are often written by other professionals inspired by his brand, such as when Justin Tranter spoke about \u2018getting in the singer's head\u2019 when he was writing Sorry with Julia Michaels, even though he had never met him (and didn't for over two years after the song had been released). There isn't a single song that Justin wrote entirely himself, and there are noticeably few songs on his recent albums that he doesn't get writing credit for. Watching the documentary, it is clear the Poo Bear develops the narrative and inspires most of what is sung, though Justin riffs back and forth with him, and often writes lines down himself that get worked in by his team. More than anything, he is the vessel that embodies his \u2018brand\u2019 - which is one that up until recently has been in-and-out of love with Selena Gomez, whom Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels also wrote for, in a strange, artificial two-way conversation with themselves. In Justin's first albums, he is only given co-writing credit for just 3 of the dozen songs. Though now, most likely in a strategic move, Universal is wise enough to give him co-credit for the majority of his releases, as it reinforces the brand image; allowing fans to buy into the idea that Justin has more original talent that perhaps is reality. Either way, he is still responsible for over 90% of the delivery of his songs (the rest being auto tune and backing vocals). To summarise, there is little evidence to suggest Justin writes even 30% of his current releases, though that figure has risen from his debut albums. He is responsible for less than 10% of the mixing, pitching and all over parts of the song. ",

            "answer_text": "He does have musical intuition. He changed the style of Ed sheeran written song (love yourself) into his style , can play many instruments, produce songs etc which is cool. And lyrics. I think he writes almost all of it by himself. But, creatively composing music, is not the job of ones meant to be cheesy pop-star or at least how it is nowadays. Put it this way, music composition is a tough, challenging and troublesome task. Unless you\u2019re rarely gifted and give your full time on it, you can\u2019t create as much as hit music as he has successively and regularly. Proof of this is the time when disgrace from the public to him was at peak his songs didn\u2019t make it to the top of the charts not just because he was hated but they were bad. All of his songs just before his comeback with \u201cWhere are you now\u201d sucked. Why?? Because the composers didn\u2019t believe their creation would sell if Justin sings it. But currently the thing is just opposite. Almost all of his songs are hit after hit. This all mean that he writes the lyrics and can add effects to the music but he can\u2019t create his own music completely on his own. Summing up his contribution Musical Composition : < 10 % Lyrics : < 50 %+ singing : 90% + 5% auto tune + 5% other vocal processing tools (EQ, reverb etc) ",
