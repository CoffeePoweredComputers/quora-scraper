            "answer_text": "Stock prices are determined by matching buy and sell orders. Each buy order is an offer to buy certain number of shares for a certain price, called bid. Each sell order is an offer  to sell certain number of shares at a certain price called ask. The price of any stock at any moment is determined by finding the price at which  the maximum number of shares will be transacted. After that price is determined, the transactions are completed and that price is shown as the price of the stock at that moment. This process is continued repeatedly during trading hours, as well as during the after-market trades. This process is highly reflexive, a fact not appreciated by many. It is reflexive because the price listed at a moment or during a sequence can be a (very) important factor in determining offers to buy or sell. There is an entire field of stock analysis, called technical analysis that studies just such movements. To get a clearer picture of this important phenomenon, imagine that stock prices were always determined only by objective external factors, subject to analysis, e.g. earnings. Then all actors would place their orders independently of market trading, selling when they think the price is high relative to their perceptions of the growth of the underlying  stock and/or their liquidity needs and buying if they think prices are low and they have the money. Showing prices of transactions at all times changes the picture as there can be some actors who act on price movement alone e.g. they might be more inclined to buy stocks which have been going up, or have followed certain patterns etc. Such players also contribute to the overall market by providing additional liquidity which makes trades more efficient by lowering spreads between asking and bidding prices. Note that improved efficiency of trading does not imply improved efficiency of price discovery as it can be argued that the influx of technical trading players makes prices more prone to such patterns in a reflexive process.  For instance, if they tend to keep buying only stocks that go up, then stocks will tend to go up  just for the sake of doing so until they suddenly stop because technical buyers reached their technical limits. Similar scenarios apply to other widely accepted technical trends e.g. head-and-shoulders etc. Companies with highly valued stocks are masters of managing this process by making sure their fundamentals keep improving AND they react to bad patterns and breaks in technical behavior of their stocks.  One can argue that companies with great track records of continually rising earnings do not need to care about  behavior of their stock prices, as they often state themselves. Google has been a great example of such behavior. On the other hand, there are also companies that have been enjoying benefits of very high stock prices for years, with minimal actual earnings, such as Amazon.  Their fans will point out to all the potential, but you can ask their competitors what they think of markets giving Amazon continued access to all this capital to squash competition and run their operations. The point is that reflexive market behaviors can be a key factor in determining who wins and loses. ",

            "answer_text": "I had a question like this recently too, made some research and came up with a summary of what I learned. I wrote a Medium post about it. I\u2019ll just copy and paste it here. Primer on stock prices and markets This is me trying to recount what I learned about stock prices a few days ago. I\u2019ll do it into a primer for a 5 year old. I\u2019ll also assume this 5 year old knows or at least wants to know more of what a stock market is, and what it has to do with the value of a company. The value of a company, put simply, is calculated by multiplying the value of it\u2019s shares by the number of outstanding stock. Pay close attention to the two terms I highlighted. The first one was all my inquiry was about. The second one I\u2019ll explain first. A company is usually owned by several people, organizations too. Let\u2019s call these entities shareholders. Shareholders as the name suggest, own a particular amount of shares in the company. So let\u2019s say the company was divided into one million parts or shares and a particular entity owns 500,000 of those shares. You would say the entity owns 50% of the company. So to own some part of the company you need to buy their shares. And the purchase of these shares are done at market value. That is, if the market says a company\u2019s stock or share is worth $10 per unit, it is at the market price that an intending shareholder would buy. Take note again of that term because the value of a company\u2019s stock has little to do with how much the company wants to sell it but what the market is willing to pay for it. How is this market price then set? Glossing over it, I\u2019ll do like what every other blog does and say it is determined by the forces of demand and supply. But, if anything, that only made me want to know more. More of it\u2019s technicality, not some theory. I\u2019m assuming you know what a stock market is, but for clarification and simplicity, we\u2019ll say it\u2019s a building where people go to buy stock they are interested in. Likewise, people who want to sell stock also go here to meet potential buyers. This market has an opening and closing time. You can only, technically, buy and sell stock when the market is open. But you can make pre-orders for stock, pending the time when the market opens. Let\u2019s start from the time a company makes it possible for people to trade it\u2019s stock, this is called an IPO, Initial Public Offering. This is almost like the one time a company has the ability to put a price on it\u2019s stock. Let\u2019s make a company up and bring it to it\u2019s IPO. Numbers Inc. is announcing it\u2019s IPO and creating 1 million shares at $20 per piece. This values the company at 20 million dollars. Now, I want to buy into Numbers Inc. but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth $20 so I offer $15. Another bloke (just for imitation of an actual market) offers $25. This is where the market comes in and say, alright, let\u2019s come to an agreement and decide to sell it for the average of all the offers received against the stated amount sellers (a single one now, the company) is willing to sell. An aggregate amount is reached and the stock market announces that value as the price of a unit of stock in that company. Everyone trades at that value, selling and buying. In reality, we\u2019d have hundreds, if not thousands buying and selling at the same time. And the market price changing steadily too, typically 3 seconds, I would say. And the stock market, I would assume too, uses more complex calculations to arrive at a market value. Simulate that exercise over thousands of traders and over multiple times per second. Hundreds of entities stating desired buy amounts, and sellers staying theirs too. In it\u2019s way, the value of a company\u2019s stock is determined by how much people are willing to buy it and how much others are willing to let it go. ",
