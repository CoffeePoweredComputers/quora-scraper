            "answer_text": "In 2005, I had written maybe one song with another person by 2012 I had written songs with easily over 100 people. These people ranged from complete songwriting and collaborating beginners like myself to my absolute heroes, like Burt Bacharach and Bob Dylan. The unsatisfying but true answer is that each situation is a little different, but I\u2019ll try to paint with broad strokes. The contact is the easy part. We literally found one of my co-writers in the phone book. My manager called and made our case and I was writing with him the next week. Things can happen from social media, trading e-mails, phone calls all of it. The easiest situation is when all artists involved are working professionals and see the value in working together. If you don\u2019t have the experience or resume of the people you want to work with, it may be harder until you do. That\u2019s where a team with experience can be invaluable. Even if I could have gotten in touch with the more legendary writers I worked with, they never would have said yes if they hadn\u2019t gotten a call directly from the publisher. Who writes the lyrics depends on the situation. Mr. Bacharach writes strictly melody so my job was to fit the lyrics exactly to the what he had created. Whereas Luigi Creatore wrote only lyrics so my job was to write a melody for them. Hip hop, R&B and some areas of pop work completely opposite. It is typical to receive a fully produced track with no theme or lyric idea, and be asked to write a full song or a hook on top of it, you may not know what rapper is going to feature on the track in the future. Conversely with Lupe Fiasco, we\u2019ve cowritten many hooks together and he always has a strong concept for the song before I come in, many times the verses are already written. For most of us, contracts are the least favorite part. For songwriting you\u2019re talking about publishing contracts and split agreements. Who\u2019s written what percent of the song. This is best decided by the writers who were in the room writing the song and is almost always amiable. This can get complicated if a song isn\u2019t written all at once, or has multiple rewrites. I typically agree on splits with my cowriters, if there is a problem I rarely get into disputes with my collaborators, I let the lawyers and publishing company handle that, the friends are worth more than I\u2019ll make on the song regardless.
