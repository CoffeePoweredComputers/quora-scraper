            "answer_text": "I played in rock bands for over thirty years and always fought the same battle. I could teach a college class on how to succeed in a writing, recording, and touring a rock (metal, grunge, hard rock, pop, alternative, etc) band. Here is a list of the primary things you need to do to make success a possibility, although nothing is guaranteed and there are thousands (hundreds of thousands)of bands who did everything right and failed. Based on how old you are, get the hell out of your town. If you already live in New York, Chicago, Seattle, LA, or Austin, disregard this one, but location is everything.Kick everyone out of the band that isn\u2019t 100% involved. I mean it. They\u2019ll waste years of your life and not even say sorry. They are weekend warriors who answer to a higher power (wife, girlfriend, mother, father, school, etc.) and will ultimately drag you down.Write the absolutely BEST songs you can!! Take a page from some of the greats and plagiarize (discreetly) anyone you can. The stronger the material, the better your odds. Play covers too, even after your famous. Their fun!Ask yourself: what do you want out of life. Are you a student in college? If so, stay there, get your degree in whatever It is you\u2019re studying. Always have a backup plan. If you aren\u2019t, you better have a technical skill because the odds are vastly against you. You\u2019ll need some way to make money.If you are a full on, total rocker, then create an image, a stage name, and practice until you totally rule the fucking planet, and hang out where rockers hang and you\u2019ll find the guys (gals) who will help you fulfill your goals/dreams.So, to answer your question: is the band you\u2019re in and the music WORTH believing in? A lot of rock greats started as no one, they created themselves through dedication and practice. If you believe you\u2019re the next (fill in your act of choice) and you\u2019re ready for a difficult, frustrating (yet potentially awesome!) experience, fire everyone in your band, get the fuck out of nowhereville and create a new you. It might succeed, it might fail, but at least you tried.",

            "answer_text": "I played bass in a number of bands in the 60s and 70s . Finally , after playing in 4 different bands , I joined a band where we were all like-minded , there wasn't a wide disparity in ability/talent level and the chemistry just worked . Sometimes it takes a while before you fall into the right situation . Ultimately , you may have to move on to find that \u201cright\u201d situation for yourself . Likely , your current bandmates won't experience a group epiphany and suddenly change their attitudes . Go to jam sessions , experience what other musicians have to offer and start networking to try to find that \u201cright\u201d situation . The music business is tough enough without having to deal with folks whose level of dedication isn't on the same level . Good luck bro . /;-{> ",
