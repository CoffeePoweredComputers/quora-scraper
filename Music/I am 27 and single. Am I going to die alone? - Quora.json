Since then I have dated, however, the guys ended up being Very different from who they said they were. Lying, cheating and when caught I\u2019ve been gas lighted and made to feel unstable. Even though I knew I was true to the relationship and never over reacted when their true colours were shown. I may ask the same question, however, I\u2019m glad to be single rather than stuck with any of the guys I\u2019ve met along the way. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is you may feel lonely and that the single life will never end. However folk will come along,just make sure they are the right person and don\u2019t settle for anyone who does not bring the same love, care and respect to the table as you do. We both will meet potential partners, we just need to know when To stay with the right person and to run when they are not good for us. ",

            "answer_text": "I am 42, never been married and have no kids (and due to female issues can\u2019t have kids as of last year). My life is completely full with the wonderful people who surround me. I had plenty of men try to \u201cwife me up,\u201d but I never settled. Sure, during COVID I reflected and wished I had given some men more grace and time to see what happened. However, I live for today, not tomorrow and not in the past (when possible). My friend met her husband at age 41. Some never marry (nor have kids) and still believe they've led a full life. Reality is a matter of perspective. You are never alone, as I assume you have friends and family, so it ultimately is a choice. Also, I hope that didn\u2019t come across too harsh. I understand the world is confusing right now and please know I am not trying to dismiss your feelings, as they are real and valid. I am just giving you my take on my life and giving you a different way of seeing things from a real person who has gone a different way. I honestly wish you all the best. And I hope you don\u2019t feel alone and it is a passing feeling of the times\u2026 everyone deserves to feel loved and supported. ",
