            "answer_text": "I've read many answers regarding this question with the first one dating back to 2011 and many were saying in a way that Yoko was sure John would cheat on her so in her manipulative way she arranged the John-May Pang affair because it was something she could control as May was their employee. I dont know if it was true - that Yoko's insecurity was the reason why she encouraged this affair. It could be. But if I'm going to believe a version I'd rather believe the Yoko Ono version in the 1980 Playboy interviews (not the condensed and edited magazine version but the unedited book that followed which was the series of interviews in their entirety). If she was alone during the interview I'd have my reservation but my tendency is to believe her because John was present and making interjections when she was answering questions. Could they be lying? Could it be an act on their part? I certainly don't think so. John would have not allowed it because he consented to this series of interviews so there could be (his own words) a \u201creference book\" about him. Which was providential as he was assassinated right after.  Anyways, when asked by the interviewer David Sheff about it, if what he heard and read about it were true (the split up leading to the May Pang thing), John said, \u201cthere's a pinch of truth and a lot of herbal dressing\u201d. The only thing accurate, according to Yoko, was they were separated. \u201cIt wasn't like either of us was suffering about it\". Lennon: \u201cWell, I suffered -\u201d Ono: \u201cOkay, but-\u201d Lennon: \u201cWe talked about it and she kicked me out is what actually happened\u201d Playboy: \u201cWhy?\u201d Ono: \u201cWell, I really needed some space because I was used to being an artist and free and all that, and when I got together with John, because we're always in the public eye, I lost the freedom. And also, both of us were together all the time -\u201d Lennon: \u201cTwenty four hours a day -\u201d And Yoko went on to say she was under tremendous pressure because she was supposed to have split-up the Beatles and the one preventing them from getting back together again and that she stole John from the public or something. Ono: \u201cMy artwork suffered. I suffered a lot and so I thought I wanted to be free from all that. I needed space to think.\u201d She asked John to go to LA so she could be alone. May Pang, being their personal assistant, assisted John who was very much against the idea, in going to LA. May Pang in her book said she saw in John an unhappy man and that when they became an item she saw in him \u201cthe happiness of an unhappy man\". (Given the situation, who seduced who, one can only speculate) Of course he was unhappy, until the time she and John were supposed to be lovers, John was regularly calling Yoko, begging her to be allowed to come home. In Yoko and John's version, Yoko did not encourage John to have a relationship with May Pang. The worst that can be said was that Yoko's actions, though unintentional, became instrumental in making that affair to happen. And another reason why I believed in Yoko's narrative was this (mind you, I'm not pro-Yoko, I'm a Beatles fan. Being a Beatles fan and a Pro-Yoko? For me that\u2019s an oxymoron. Im just trying to be very objective here) - they were together 24/7, I'm a married man, many of my friends and relatives were married, we all know that for a man and wife to be together all the time is not necessarily a good thing. Problems could arise because of this, the least of which is one getting insecure that the other would cheat - for how could it even cross your mind that your partner could cheat when the two of you are always together? This kind of problem would usually crop up when one party is always away - which was simply not the case with John and Yoko, in fact it was the reverse. Now, the problem more likely to arise in this situation is one party getting bored or suffocated and wanting space. And so, Yoko's reason of needing space and wanting a break seemed more plausible than that version of her being suspicious of John cheating, then secretly arranging an affair for him and May Pang. Excuse me, let me take a step back and review the underlying premise from which their version was based on: \u201cyou're insecure and suspicious that your husband would cheat on you, and so you concocted an affair for him?\u201d\u2026Is that even logical? Thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "So many good points have already been made but I will add my 2 cents because it seems that some overlooked the main point of the question. Yoko did not see May Pang as a threat to her and she was basically just a pawn to Yoko. Yoko asked to see May and then told her that her and John were having problems in their marriage. She was talking about how John would be seeing other people and said since she was single that she should go out with John. May was totally against the idea at first but Yoko also pitched the idea to John. By having her go to LA with John she insured that he wouldn\u2019t be hooking up with another woman out there who could have presented a threat. May Pang was a safe choice and she was a person she trusted to keep an eye on John without stealing him away. Yoko knew that John was not in love with May and may was also the complete opposite of Yoko and not the strong and assertive woman John seemed to need. Better the devil you know than the devil you don\u2019t know scenario. This is a great interview that tells all the details of how things went down.  EDIT: I just felt the need to add a little more info that I had neglected to put in my original answer. It really gets more into detail. Though many don\u2019t know this at the time Yoko wanted to set John up with May Pang Yoko was having an affair. She was actually having 2 but one was more of a little fling and that was with David Spinozza who was a guitarist. David had a reputation for bedding a multitude of women including Yoko. She was also having an affair with a man named Sam Greene. She was actually ready to divorce John and even asked for a divorce. When Sam made it clear that while he enjoyed having the affair he was not interested in marrying Yoko. Because of this Yoko changed her mind about the divorce. Yoko confided in a few people that she was growing tired of John and that is why she started having affairs. John had slept with a few women himself before May Pang. In spite of the image John and Yoko wanted to portray they did have such a loving marriage by 1973. I think the novelty of being married to a Beatle was wearing thin for Yoko but she liked everything that came with being married to John as it afforded her opportunities she wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.
