            "answer_text": "Because when humans hear multiple sounds simultaneously, we naturally hear the higher sounds easier than the lower ones.  Try it: press two keys on the piano at the same time with the same force, and notice how you hear the higher note more then the lower one. I am no expert, but here is my educated guess as to the evolutionary reason:  lower sounds in nature tend to background noise such as wind, thunder, ocean waves, etc.  Higher sounds tend to be more important such as the speech of a fellow human, or the cry of predators or prey.  So we evolved the ability to notice higher pitches more easily. There are other consequences of this in music. For example, violinists (and violists, cellists...) often do vibrato, which is rapidly changing pitch to create a richer sound (it's that thing when they seem to be shaking their hands rapidly).  They always oscillate the pitch from below the note to the note, and never go above the note, because we notice the highest pitch that is produced.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is actually being flouted sometimes now, because we have the ability to adjust levels and project sound electronically in a way we never did before. The standard was set, though, by thousands of years of auditoriums and stages.  High pitched melodies would penetrate ambient noises and chatter and be heard clearly in the back of the audience.  Lower pitched sounds get lost on the way.  This is also one of the main reasons orchestral solos have traditionally gone to the Violin - an instrument which was actually invented to project melodies to the back row of large auditoriums that the Viol (the closest modern equivalent to which is the Viola) couldn't quite get to. Interesting side trivia: It's actually the treble range that kills your hearing when you listen to music too loud, not the bass. ",
