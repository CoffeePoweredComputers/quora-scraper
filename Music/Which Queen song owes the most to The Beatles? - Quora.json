            "answer_text": "Overall I think Queen, like the Beatles, is uniquely melodically oriented and more so than most rock bands. I think that this is probably one of the ways they most influenced by Beatles. I also think that Freddie\u2019s use of the piano in composing and performance has some influence from McCartney. Lennon to some extent also but I think McCartney was more of a piano man then John, even though he used the instrument beautifully too.Of course many artists and bands from the seventies could be said to owe much to the Beatles and show influence in many regards. I can\u2019t say which Queen song owes the absolute most to the Beatles but a few songs come to mind especially ones that are in the \u201cDancehall\u201d style similar to McCartney\u2019s songs like \u201cHoney Pie\u201d or \u201cWhen I\u2019m 64\u201d.    Sometimes Brian May\u2019s voice resembles McCartney\u2019s voice to my ears..not exactly but some nuances of it like when McCartney is singing more clearly and less in his rocker voice. The song \u201c39\u201d has a skiffle pop feel like \u201cI\u2019ve Just Seen A Face\u201d and maybe a little bit of the maritime feel like \u201cUncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\u201d\u2026  Probably a musicologist or a Beatles music scholar could assess and identify other nuances of Queen\u2019s music and determine to what extent there is Beatles influence . I\u2019d Say that \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d has some influence from The Beatles in how it\u2019s structure is episodic like \u201cA Day In The Life\u201d or \u201cHappiness Is A Warm Gun\u201d or \u201cUncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\u201d or the Abbey Road Medley.
