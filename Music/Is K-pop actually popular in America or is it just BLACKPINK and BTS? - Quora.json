            "answer_text": "To be completely honest, it\u2019s just BTS at the moment. What I mean about this is that they are the group that the public can recognize or have heard of before, since they are all over social media, television, and news broadcasts. However, Blackpink is hands down the most popular girl group within the niche K-pop community in the USA. Their popularity is not that well-known among the public, yet. You never know if in the future they could release a smash radio hit and receive the public\u2019s awareness, or end up like PSY where his song was more popular than him. Similar to Fifth Harmony where their songs were better known than the girl group itself. K-pop itself is becoming more known within the country especially after BTS hit it off in 2017. I have noticed that a lot of US-ARMY are becoming more open to other groups and becoming multifandom. Why is this important? We all know that BTS\u2019s fandom in the US is MUCH larger than any other Korean group. How do we know? Their sales and touring attendance proves that. Billboard 200 Album Chart BTS MOTS: Persona (2019)- 230K first week sales (410K as of June 5th, 2019); Physical distribution and Amazon.LY: Answer (2018) - 185K first week sales (600K+ as of June 5th,2019); Physical distribution, tour bundle & Amazon.LY: Tear (2018)- 135K first week sales (400K+ as of June 5th, 2019); Amazon and physical distribution.LY: Her (2017)- 31K first week sales (350K+ as of June 5th, 2019); only digital distribution.5. WINGS (2016) - 16K first week sales; only digital distribution. At that time, it was huge. It broke BoA\u2019s 7-year record for highest first week sales for a Korean Act with 8K in 2009.Backpink Kill This Love EP (2019) - 19K first week sales; tour bundleSquare Up (2018) - 14K first week sales; only digital distributionEXO DMUMT (2018) - 23K first week sales; Physical distribution and AmazonThe War (2017) - 8K first week sales; only digital distributionNCT We are SUPERHUMAN (2019) - 27K first week sales; Merch bundles, Amazon, physical distribution, 9+ versions for vinyl/album, and RVSP access to see NCT if you preorder their album in the US. Basically, a lot of gimmicks to increase first week sales.Regular-Irregular (2018) - 8K first week sales; Amazon and physical distribution.If we go by sales, it seems like NCT is more popular than Blackpink/EXO in the USA, which isn\u2019t true. The more gimmicks you use, the more sales you get. US - Tour BTS WINGS Arena Tour (2016) - 66k+ attendance with 5 concerts LY Arena + Citi Field Stadium (2018) - 220K+ with 12 concertsLY Stadium Tour (2019) - 330K+ with 6 concerts Love Yourself Tour Total Attendance: ~550K+ (Biggest US Touring Attendance for a Korean Act) Blackpink In Your Area (2019) - 60K-65K with 7 concerts NCT Awaken and We are Superhuman (2019) - Numbers unknown with 10 concerts. Basically, fandom size: BTS >>>>>> WALL >>>> EXO>Blackpink>NCT Overall popularity: BTS (huge fandom + 7/10 public recognition) >>>>>>>>> Blackpink (fandom + most popular girl group within the K-pop niche + 3/10 public recognition) >> EXO > NCT > GOT7=Monsta X=TWICE > other Korean groups. Social media and YouTube have helped A LOT with the growing popularity of K-pop in the USA. Will it ever go mainstream? I doubt it. Only 1\u20132 groups will be able to maintain their popularity (fandom + public recognition) there. BTS is one one them and Blackpink could continue to grow up to BTS\u2019s level, or another group could surpass them too. ",

            "answer_text": "K-pop, including BTS and Blackpink, isn\u2019t very popular here. Certainly not to the degree of Ariana Grande and the likes. That being said, if you\u2019re young you probably know of BTS. Maybe Blackpink. But usually it\u2019s just BTS. If you know of Blackpink the chances are you know of Twice, Exo, etc. The big ones. So yeah, it\u2019s mostly BTS that\u2019s popular, and even then they aren\u2019t huge. K-pop as a whole isn\u2019t really a thing. ",
