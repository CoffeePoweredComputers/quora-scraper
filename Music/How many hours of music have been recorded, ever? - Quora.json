            "answer_text": "At least 2 hours. Think about every 3\u20136 minute song that you know. Now, multiply that number by 15. That number represents only 1% of the music that lasts from 3\u20136 minutes. Multiply that number by the remaining 99%, and divide by 60. This makes the total hour quantified. Now, take your number and multiply it again by 10x10^80. Divide by 60 again. This should give you a good start. Once you've finished listening to all that you should be 80 for the 16th time. Since you're done listening to all the old music, you can now listen to all the new music, and all the musical combinations. So take every second of time that can be used to make, listen, and record music, and multiply that by the millions of combinations that are possible. This number makes the total amount of music that will ever be possible. The universe will end by that time, but at least you spent that time doing something enjoyable. ",
