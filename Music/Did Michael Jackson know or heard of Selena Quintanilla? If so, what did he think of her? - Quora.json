Not to mention, Michael might\u2019ve heard of her through his buddy, Marlon Brando since Brando and Selena were in \u201cDon Juan DeMarco\u201d:  Michael also might\u2019ve heard of Selena thanks to his sister, Rebbie.

Now, of course Selena was a HUGE fan of MJ (and Janet Jackson), it's not entirely known for sure that Michael Jackson never actually heard of her. They were both big at the time and it's possible that he heard her name once or twice, but it's not probable. ",
