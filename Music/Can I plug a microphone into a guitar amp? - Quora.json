            "answer_text": "yes, you can use a microphone with a guitar amp but the quality will not be ideal. If you are just starting out in a band and you already own guitar amps then it is a quick way of being able to amplify a microphone. You already have the equipment available and you don\u2019t have to go and spend lots more money on specialist equipment when maybe all you want to do is have a jam or practice together. When I first started in a band we did exactly this. We used a small guitar amp to amplify our lead singers' vocals, just so we could hear him over the other instruments. We knew that when we would come to play a gig that the bar or venue would have its own speaker system. You are pretty much always expected to provide your own guitar amps and even drum kit but you are almost never asked to provide a speaker system for vocals and so investing in your own system to simply practice at home may not be that wise if you can just use a spare guitar amp.

            "answer_text": "Yes. I\u2019ve done it a number of times. It works just fine. The amplifier knows nothing about the source of the sound. Nor will it hurt your speakers either. Sometimes a pre-amp is useful to get the levels right though. If you have an acoustic guitar amplifier, it will sound better, as will, paradoxically some bass guitar amplifiers. They have a different frequency response with a better higher frequency range. If you are doing it just for fun, it will give you a chance to practice with amplification. And that will be useful, when you do this for others, fun or not. Most of amplifier design is the same - whatever the source. There is just a little for the specific instrument and the rest is marketing. (and that\u2019s a bit of a generalisation, but I\u2019m happy to put it out there) ",

I\u2019ve done this regularly with my Behringer GM108 guitar amp, and lots of people have borrowed it to be used as a PA for voice. A fair warning though, it will fuck up the sound of your guitar amp the more you use it like that, especially at louder volumes. My Behringer GM108, though already a crappy amp in the first place, lost most of its treble response, so much so that a Strat in the bridge position with the tone knob dimed still sounds like a Les Paul in the neck position with the tone halfway.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it will plug in and amplify the signal presented to the microphone. However, it will sound terrible. A guitar amp is not a PA system, it is usually only a single speaker driver (or multiples of same driver) often with an open back, not meant to reproduce wide frequency range, but rather to make an electric guitar sound (subjectively) good. Guitar amps are often in-fact prized for the ways in which they color sound. This is opposed to a PA speaker designed to reproduce as wide and accurate a freq range as possible using multiple drivers and circuitry to divide the frequency spectrum and send appropriate ranges to appropriate drivers (I.e.: woofers and tweeters).

            "answer_text": "You can. There will be an impedance mismatch compromising quality. A guitar amp/speaker rig is optimised to boost mids and to lose bass and trebles (over about 7kHz). That will remove a lot of detail the mic is picking up. It will sound muddy. You will need a cable or adapter that takes a 3-pin balanced XLR line and converts it to a 2-pin unbalanced line. This effectively halves the level of the input signal, while increasing the noise. So your signal to noise ratio is hit by a double whammy. You might get through a rehearsal. I would not do it for any serious live performance, and certainly not for a recording. ",

            "answer_text": "With that cable you can. If you run it mild, your speakers should be ok. It\u2019s not going to giving a very full sound on your voice however. A guitar amp is not really made for voices just like they\u2019re are not really made for bass guitars. You can run both through a guitar amp but it\u2019ll sound thin. Also too much and you will shorten speaker life. The first couple of bands I played in, the singer sung through a guitar amp. We sucked so bad it didn\u2019t matter that we sounded bad. You alternative would be to get a small PA. ",

As mentioned in another response, you will need two channels. Also keep in mind that guitar amps and speakers are voiced for electric guitars and not vocals, so it won't sound as good as a PA. If you are serious about performing, I'd look at investing in a small, quality PA system. ",
