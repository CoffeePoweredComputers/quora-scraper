            "answer_text": "For easiest home karaoke do this: Purchase your vocal equipment from a music store. You don't need much.  Purchase 1 or 2 mid-level microphones. Not the cheapest, not the most $$.Purchase a small (4 channel min) vocal mixer, preferably with effects.Purchase a small (10\"-13\") self powered or \"active\" speaker.Connect a computer to a video display of your choice, or use the display on your device.Connect a computer to a sound system of your choice for music to be heard.Find one of several on-line karaoke sites.7.  Choose your songs and sing. The reason I recommend separate vocal equipment is to avoid overload or damage caused by high-level vocal input to your home audio equipment. Your voice will also sound better. The reason I recommend on-line karaoke sites is that you have immediate access to very large selections of karaoke tracks, suitable for home use. You can always purchase karaoke tracks to play when you aren't on-line. ",
