            "answer_text": "The wrong direction by PassengerI'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection I thought I was close but under further inspection It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, ohh! 2. The redemption song By Lukas Graham The people we have given trust End up corrupt and rottenThey start with great idealsBut on the way that's all forgottenAll I know isWe need hope right now The darkness makes it hard to see the lightBut the time is always right to do what's rightIf you only knewI'm just as scared as youYou're not the only one 3. No matter what by Calum scott When I was a young boy I was scared of growing upI didn\u2019t understand it but I was terrified of loveFelt like I had to choose but it was outta my controlI needed to be saved, I was going crazy on my ownTook me years to tell my mother, I expected the worstI gathered all the courage in the world She said, \"I love you no matter whatI just want you to be happy and always be who you are\"She wrapped her arms around meSaid, \"Don\u2019t try to be what you\u2019re not'Cause I love you no matter what\"She loves me no matter what 4. Heartless by Matt terry When you took your love awayAnd you forgot to give my heart back to meWhat's the use of these memories?Now I can't feel, no I can't feel a thingNow that you're a runawayDon't you think that you could be the judge of me?It was love that made me this wayNow I can't feel, no I can't feel a thing I don't wanna rewind, regretI don't need to forgive, forgetAnd I thought you'd ought to know That you made me heartlessYou left without a sound, made me heartlessMy body's falling to the ground and regardlessWe will never ever finish what we started, startedYou made me heartlessSleeping by myself, that's the hardestYou left me on the shelf in the darknessAnd ever since the moment that we partedI've been heartless 5. Photograph by Ed Sheeran Hm, we keep this love in this photographWe made these memories for ourselvesWhere our eyes are never closingHearts were never brokenAnd time's forever frozen still So you can keep meInside the pocket of your ripped jeansHolding me closer 'til our eyes meetYou won't ever be alone And if you hurt meThat's okay baby, only words bleedInside these pages you just hold meAnd I won\u2019t ever let you goWait for me to come home 6. Fight back by Neffex you're never gonna make ityour not good enoughthere's a million other people with the same stuffyou really think your differentman you must be kiddingthink your gonna hit itbut you just don't get itit's impossibleit's not probableyour irresponsibletoo many obstaclesyou gotta stop it yoyou gotta take it slowyou can't be a prodon't waste your time no more who the fuck are youto tell me what to doI don't give a damn if you say you disapproveI'm gonna make my moveI'm gonna make it soonand I'll do it cuz it's what I want to fuckin do cuz all these opinionsand all these positionsthey coming in millionsthey're blocking your visionbut no you can't listenthat shit is all fictioncuz you hold the power as long as your drivenyoure never gonna make itthere's no way that you make ityea maybe you can fake itbut your never gonna make it are you just gonna take that?make them take it all backdon't tell me you believe thatare you just gonna take thator will you fucking fight back? 7. Dear Insecurity by Gnash Some days, when I wake up I see myself in the mirrorI feel like what shouldn't be couldn't be clearerMy nose to my clothes, from my chin to my skinI'll never be good enough ever againFor you, so I changed for youThen I died for you, then you made me blueIf I were you, I'd hate me tooBut I already feel like you doBecause, you tell me I'm not worth shitAnd the bad luck's on purposeAnd if I'm sad then I deserve itBut underneath the surfaceI'm hurting, searching and learningMy imperfections make me perfect. 8. Staring at the stars by Passenger It's just a part of every weekWhen we lie drunkenlyJust staring at the starsRemember when they were in reachAnd all the teachers used to teachYou can do anythingIf you put your mind to itWe put our minds to it allBut disappointment crashed the ballWe could have done anythingWe just never quite knew it, so\u2026Tie your scarf on tightIt's to be a cold night 9. Love myself by Olivia O\u2019brien No matter how hard I try or what I doI just can never fuckin' impress youSo why am I letting what you say get me down?I spent my whole life thinking I was wrongAnd nobody likes me and it's all my faultBut I'm done with that shit, I finally figured out I don't need to be the same as everyone elseI just need to motherfuckin' love myself People are constantly judgin' and eyein'And plottin' and lyin', so why am I tryin'?They all gon' talk shit anywayThey're all gon' say what they wanna sayThey're all gon' say what they wanna say anywayThat's why I need to I need to love myself 10. Hotel ceiling by Rixton I can see it coming round full circle my friend.On the TV they said they had reported you dead.It was my fault 'cause I could've sworn that you said.It was easy to find another for your bed. How does it feel to leave me this way,When all that you have's been lost in a day?Everyone knows, but not what to say.I've been wonderin' now. I've been staring at the hotel ceiling,Drinking everything I've found this evening,Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling,So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely.Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this.I'm trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling,So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now. When my eyes open morning pulls me into the view, noI guess I'm only acting in the way that you do.Just being alone, no.Only time tells me more than I hope, all that I know isI'll be finding a fortnight alone and behold.I know I shouldn't have let you go. I've been staring at the hotel ceiling\u2026 11. Comethru by Jeremy Zucker I'm trying to realizeIt's alright to not be fine on your own Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffeeThese last few weeks have been exhaustingI'm lost in my imaginationAnd there's one thing that I need from youCan you come through, through 12. Just the way you are by Bruno Mars Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryingShe's so beautiful and I tell her everydayYeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe meAnd it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I seeBut every time she asks me \"Do I look okay?\"I say When I see your faceThere's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazingJust the way you areAnd when you smileThe whole world stops and stares for a while'Cause girl you're amazingJust the way you areYeah 13. The thing about love by Matt Terry That's the thing about loveThe thing about loveJust when you think you're in controlIt pulls you in and then it lets you goThat's the thing about loveThe thing about loveYou don't always get it backSo tell me how I'm gonna live like that (live like that) Doesn't matter what I do (doesn't matter what I do)All I think about is you, oh ohThere's a hurricane every time I hear your name (every time I hear your name)Now I'm wide awake the whole nightThinking what I didn't do rightNow I realize we never stood a chance (we never stood a chance) 14. Curious by Emblem3 I look in the mirror to figure out who I am,I thought I was a boy but I guess I am a man.I burnt a bridge, but that's what it took for me to build a damI hang my head, I don't want to be that kind of man. I said sometimes feelings can be hard to understand,But if we understood them there'd be no point to the planI reach out with my handAnd to all of my fans,To let you know that if you fall,I will help you standTo let you know that everyday I feel similar painThe purpose of my music is to take it all awaySo I say, salute you freedom fightersWave your flags high for,Liberty we will die for.Driftin' in the pursuit of happiness that we drive towardsA better future my people and me will strive towards. I'm lost, I find myself while I searchNow I use music to pray with no words.When you lose what you love, remember to stay strong.Look out the window and remember life goes on. P.S. - I\u2019ll add more as i remember ;) Upvote & Follow Peace \u270c\ufe0f Aakash Roushann ",

            "answer_text": "Sam Stone. I heard it for the first time in the 70\u2019s; the chorus line just slayed me: \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in daddy\u2019s arm where all the money goes.\u201d It was my intro to John Prine, one of my songwriting heroes. Sam Stone came home,To the wife and familyAfter serving in the conflict overseas.And the time that he served,Had shattered all his nerves,And left a little shrapnel in his knees.But the morphine eased the pain,And the grass grew round his brain,And gave him all the confidence he lacked,With a purple heart and a monkey on his back. There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.Little pitchers have big ears,Don't stop to count the years,Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios. Sam Stone's welcome homeDidn't last too long.He went to work when he'd spent his last dimeAnd soon he took to stealingWhen he got that empty feelingFor a hundred dollar habit without overtime.And the gold roared through his veinsLike a thousand railroad trains,And eased his mind in the hours that he chose,While the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes... There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.Little pitchers have big ears,Don't stop to count the years,Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios. Sam Stone was aloneWhen he popped his last balloon,Climbing walls while sitting in a chair.Well, he played his last request,While the room smelled just like death,With an overdose hovering in the air.But life had lost it's fun,There was nothing to be done,But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill,For a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill. There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.Little pitchers have big ears,Don't stop to count the years,Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios. Timeless. As a vet, it meant a bit more to me because I knew fellow soldiers who came home junkies. Not much has changed. Check it out on you tube.
