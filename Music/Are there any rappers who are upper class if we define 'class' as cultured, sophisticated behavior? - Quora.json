That he\u2019s an average white gut that raps about being an average white guy in an industry not populated by average white guys like most industry\u2019s are. Drake is another he was successful and well of before he started rapping and doesn\u2019t really act hood. Finally I would say Macklemore he\u2019s pop cause he doesn\u2019t appeal to the normal fans of raps so he\u2019s got a fan base of people who like \u201crap\u201d but don\u2019t like the rawness Of it.
