            "answer_text": "To speak frankly i don\u2019t think that the OS really matters. It\u2019s the tool that\u2019s more important. If you find the right tool for music production based on your needs you are good to go. But then i\u2019d give Mac OS X an upper hand because of the advance trackpad on a Mac and other easy controls that totally changes the experience of using designing and music production tools. I have both Windows and Mac systems but i do most of my professional work on my Mac system because its a lot easier and saves me the trouble of carrying an external mouse with me all the time. The rest depends on your budget and applications. Good luck making music! ",
