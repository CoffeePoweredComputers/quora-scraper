            "answer_text": "Hmm Pedro, I don't know. Are you asking me if I heard it. Your question kinda throws me off bud. But maybe I'm reading it wrong. Hopefully you can help me understand your question better, by explaining what you mean better. But I'll try to answer for what I'm seeing. Judging by the way the question appears your asking why the song is named that, well tbh Sometimes certain music is either written by a female, or male person who then it's song by at example vice-versa or by the person who made it. Some song artist song there own songs while others sing music written by a song artist who are not them. For example a male could sing a song written by a female or vice-versa or they sing a male with male song. Hopefully I got that right and hopefully it helps. But my knowledge is limited to what I know from experience and learning from rescources from things I read or seen in the past. ",
