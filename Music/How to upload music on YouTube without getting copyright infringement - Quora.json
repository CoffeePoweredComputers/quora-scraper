            "answer_text": "In addition to the occasional song for my home videos, I actually had to seriously consider this in relation to my films.  Certainly have to own everything in a film. Youtube does have music available for free use on its site.  I suppose that's technically not uploading, but it's worth mentioning.  If you only plan to show your video on Youtube, or are only concerned with it having music there, it's usually a good idea to use their music.  They let you tweak just how loud it is, in relation to your video's audio. Certainly if it's music you created, you can use it.  If you have any musical ability, even to the point of doing something silly on a recorder, it actually will be pretty appropriate for most of what you see on Youtube, so I'd seriously consider this option.  It's fun! If there's music that's put into the public domain, as in absolutely free to do what you want with it, you can use that.  This doesn't mean the song itself being public domain.  The performance needs to be public domain.  So even though you might not have to reimburse J.S. Bach for his song, whoever played it sure as hell has the right to decide how their performance is used, and whether or not it requires compensation.  It's a separate consideration.  There's some stock music that comes with some audio/video-editing software (to get you started) that you certainly can use freely too. If the music has some license attached to it, you may be able to use it if your use falls within certain guidelines.  Creative commons music often works for Youtube, but read the specifics of the license it's posted with.  What I've often seen is specific requirements of \"attribution\", where you have to include specific text in the description of the Youtube video:  \"Music by so and so\".  The license might also restrict its use to non-commercial use, or whatever other conditions.  Creative commons music web sites might categorize the licenses for you, to help filter based on how you can use the music. Then there's the simple option of paying someone for a license. There's lots of web sites that have music you can preview and, by swiping your credit card, download immediately.  Or, of course, you can pay the copyright holder (musician or whoever owns the rights) the old-fashioned way.  Keep a copy of your receipt and license handy, in case someone challenges your right to use the music.  If someone does, and you have a license, you'd respond with this evidence. Hard to find anything you like?  You can find someone to compose the music!  For Youtube, keep in mind, you don't need high-end studio-sounding stuff.  Did you see the movie Juno?  Something simple usually works.  Maybe a little better than the recorder idea :)  What you might not realize is that a lot of musicians out there just want to get their name out there (via attribution), and if your video's for public distribution, they might give it their all and surprise you.  It'll also be timed and otherwise customized for your video, which puts it above 99.999% of what's out there.  The only problem is, if they're really not delivering, it's a bit awkward to pass, after they've done this for you for free :) ",

            "answer_text": "How can you upload music to YouTube and avoid copyright infringement? Don\u2019t upload someone else\u2019s music. Copyright infringement is copying or distributing someone else\u2019s work without their permission. YouTube is a distribution method, so clearly that makes this an illegal act. Permission consists of: A specific use license, allowing you to use the music in a certain way, and then distribute that resulting work. For instance, I have a short film that has been doing well in film festivals. The music made for that film was granted under a use license allowing us to put it in our film and then post that film online and show it in film festivals. I have a contract granting that permission.General use licensing, such as Creative Commons. This covers any work posted online with a standing license that allowed anyone to use or share the work. Possibly there are some limitations on use, such as requiring attribution, or not using it in a commercial use (promotion for a product/service or directly selling the resulting work).Some try to apply the U.S. law of \u201cfair use\u201d to their inclusion of music to a video. That almost never works. Fair use requires the use to fit a narrow set of purposes: parody, review, academic use. And to use the minimum amount necessary. So using a whole song is not fair use. And unless your video is reviewing the song or changing the words in the song to become a parody, you really can\u2019t fit the demands of fair use. Plus, most people in the world are not in the U.S., so fair use usually isn\u2019t even an option. ",

Some indie musicians are more interested in their music becoming widely known than in preventing people from sharing it.may be violating copyright, but the copyright holder isn\u2019t able to protect their copyright for some reason (financial, physical disability, legal dispute over copyright ownership, can\u2019t prove copyright ownership, etc.).the copyright holder may not be a participant in YouTube\u2019s Content ID (CID) program. YouTube automatically checks for violations on behalf of CID members. Other copyright holders may need to search for violators on their own.all famous songs aren\u2019t covered by copyright. Content published before 1923, after 1922 and before 1978 without the (c) notice, and after 1922 and before 1964 with (c) notice but not renewed after 28 years is in the public domain.
