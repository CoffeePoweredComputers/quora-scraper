            "answer_text": "Not for any particular reason, but just about all piano compositions I have ever listened to, and the scores that are usually played on National Public Radio. Anything from Tchaikovsky to Beethoven and Bach is usually a piece that I find makes me feel happier. With the academic answer out of the picture, there\u2019s an array of songs that make me happy, and one in particular is \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d. It goes: You are my sunshine, My only sunshine. You make me happy, when skies are gray. You\u2019ll never know dear, How much I love you, So please don\u2019t take my sunshine away.  My mother would sing it to me as a child. This would be an awesome question for a certified music therapist, of which I am not. Hope this helps. :) ",
