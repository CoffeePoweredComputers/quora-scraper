            "answer_text": "He was asked to join VH in mid 1985. The rift between the band & Sammy started when he disagreed with a decision to record 2 new tracks for a film soundtrack when the band had agreed to take some time off following a 1995 world tour. He was also opposed to them issuing a \u2018greatest hits\u2019 record at that point in the band\u2019s career; those 2 items were pushed by the band\u2019s then new manager. Sammy wanted to record a new album. Arrangements for when to record also got in the way, interrupting the individual members personal schedules (wives having babies). Reports conflict over what exactly happened; Sammy said he was fired, while Eddie said Sammy quit. Meanwhile, Eddie\u2019s doing deals with David Lee Roth! No mention of Alex in that sense - but, as an aside; I read an interview with bassist Billy Sheehan, who said DLR initially introduced him to the band and Alex took an immediate dislike to him. Maybe some sort of weird jealously where he didn\u2019t want a flashy bassist competing with his brother Eddie. Hmm\u2026didn\u2019t stop Billy & Steve Vai having fun duelling when they were in DLR\u2019s band. And that\u2019s just from Sammy Hagar\u2019s Wiki page! Van Halen - suffering from LSD (Lead Singer Disease)! ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s 2 Leaked chapters of an unpublished book about Sammy Hagar. It was said that Sammy was no longer interested in contributing to the book as soon as the author interviewed his ex-wife Betsy, which as you\u2019ll see in these chapters, portray Sammy in a less than favorable light. These 2 chapters explain a lot that didn\u2019t really go public. Now keep in mind, all of Sammy\u2019s quotes in these chapters came from Sammy\u2019s mouth, and Sammy has been well known to distort the truth to always be in his favor. However, I think he very much nails the Van Halen Brothers and how they go about walking through life. It\u2019s an interesting read to say the least: https://www.guitars101.com/forums/f77/sammy-hagar-book-excerpts-chapters-19-20-a-22489.html There is a part at the beginning of chapter 20 that talks about a side deal that put $300,000 in Sammy\u2019s pocket that really belonged to Roth and the Van Halen Brothers. He claims that he knew nothing of their manager Ed Leffler making this side deal, but the brothers obviously don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m not sure that I do either. I think that this incident was a major downward turning point in the relationship of Sammy and the Brothers, and I don\u2019t think Sammy was coming clean about it. ",
