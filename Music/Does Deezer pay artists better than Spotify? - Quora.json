            "answer_text": "No, or at least not by much. However, Deezer is experimenting with a different payment scheme than Spotify (and other major services.) Typically revenue is divided up by stream, which tends to send more of the money to top 40 acts as kids with lots of free time and background listeners spam the top hits playlists heavily. However, Deezer is now dividing up each subscriber\u2019s payment by their listening. Busy but listen to your favorite death metal band a few times a month? They get your entire subscription fee! This model has potential to spread the growing streaming wealth around much better than the existing one. Unfortunately, it\u2019s entirely transparent to the consumer so it\u2019s unlikely to provide Deezer with any kind of competitive edge. ",

However, speaking as a blogger, the discussion of how much each streaming service pays serves no purpose. What some of the whinny artists who are against streaming don\u2019t understand is, streaming exist because people can no longer afford music anymore. You must understand, if it were not for the streaming services, you\u2019d be making nothing, because more than half of streaming users would be pirating their music. And don\u2019t get me started with YouTube. They keep bullying Spotify, yet, YouTube pays no royalties. YouTube is nothing but one big ass Pirate Bay. Makes no different that you can monetize or not. The content uploaded is still technical illegal. That should be a huge indication to you guys that PEOPLE ARE NOT BUYING MUSIC ANYMORE!!! Except maybe for people over 40 years of age. And not even then\u2026\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Deezer doesn't pay too much less than Spotify. Where Spotify pays $0.0011 to artists, Deezer pays $0.0010. Honestly, comparing the streaming sites is not exactly apples to apples. For example, Tidal pays its artists more per play than Spotify ($.0070), but it has far fewer users (1 million), so an artist would need to rely on a larger percentage of a smaller pool of users to play their track. This analogy holds true for Deezer (6.9 million). ",
