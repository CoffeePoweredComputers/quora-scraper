If that\u2019s the case, choose that album. If not, think of the genres that you like most. If you like hip-hop or more hype-style songs then consider BTS\u2019 earlier albums. If you like more ballad-type songs or pop, check out the LY series and newerWhat kind of concepts do I like? Do you like pretty and soft concepts (like LY: Her) or dark and alternative concepts (like Dark and Wild)?When deciding on one album to buy, I ended up choosing LY: Tear because I love all the songs on the album and I love the concept photos so much \ud83d\udc9c I hope this helps!

However, this is my personal opinion. I would suggest getting your favourite album of theirs! But don\u2019t worry, whichever album you get it will be AMAZING! ",
