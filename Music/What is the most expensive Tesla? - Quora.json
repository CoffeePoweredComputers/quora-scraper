            "answer_text": "The three models you can get today (April 2019) are the Model S, the Model X, and the Model 3. Of those, the X is the most expensive. I went to the Tesla web page, chose all the most expensive options, and the grand total was $143,000 (US dollars). You could bump it up a little by buying extra-fancy floor mats and such. If you live in a country where Tesla doesn't have business yet, like Iceland, shipping charges might add quite a bit, and converting your currency into dollars might add extra cost. Design Your Model X | Tesla You can't take delivery until at least 2020 but you can buy a Tesla Roadster 2 today. The \u201cFounders Series\u201d is $250,000. Tesla Roadster A collectable rare older Tesla could theoretically cost even more. The most collectable one would be Elon Musk's personal Roadster\u2026 it's in deep space now, so you would need an insane amount of money and technology and people to launch a recovery craft to overtake it, collect it, and bring it back. That would cost many billions at this time, so with my tongue slightly in my check I nominate that as the most expensive Tesla. (I seriously think that within the next hundred years, someone will in fact collect that Roadster and put it in a museum. Maybe the museum in the biggest city on the moon or Mars instead of Earth.)

That amounts to $82,050 in upgrades, which is more than enough to purchase a basic bone stock Model S. The priciest upgrade is the bespoke interior at $25,000. This interior is custom made to order, so it\u2019s up to the buyer to decide what he or she wants on the inside of this Model S. Cheapest upgrade? How \u2019bout some interior LED lighting for only $600. Oddly, T Sport-line actually boasts of this being the most expensive Model S. It\u2019s not often you hear someone bragging over how expensive a product is, but perhaps T Sport-line wants to draw in some attention. If that\u2019s the case, then \u201cworld\u2019s most expensive\u201d gets the job done. ",
