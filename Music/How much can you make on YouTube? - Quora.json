            "answer_text": "The average YouTuber? 22 $ a month.  YouTube pays the great majority of its creators with hope instead of cash. You can only apply for a \u201cseat\u201d in the partnership program (\u201cYPP\u201d) if you have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time within the last 12 months. If your content is not totally non \u201ccontroversial\u201d, then your application won\u2019t be granted. In 2019, 31 million channels had more than 10 subscribers (you aren\u2019t a YouTuber with less than that), and 25 million of those did NOT have enough subscribers (1,000) to be eligible for the partner program. How Many YouTube Channels Are There? | Tubics Probably half of those remaining \u201cbig\u201d channels can\u2019t be a partner because their content is about religion, politics, news, guns, sex, kids and and and. So about 90% of all YouTubers are paid with the HOPE to make money one day. Let us look at the remaining 10%, those who ARE getting paid by YouTube. Alphabet (mother company of Google and YouTube) published the YouTube earnings for 2019, as a first time ever. 15 billion dollars total. YouTube is a $15 billion-a-year business, Google reveals for the first time They SAY that 55% of the ad revenue is paid to the creators. Now nobody can check if that is true, as there are no public audits and no true figures. But let us give them the benefit of the doubt. 15 billion times 0,55 is 8.25 billion, the nominal creator payout. Let us divide that number through the 31 million YouTubers and then through the estimated 3 million channels in the partner program. Here is the bitter truth: The average YouTube Partner makes 2,750 dollars a year, or 229 dollars a month. The average YouTuber makes 266 dollars a year, or 22 dollars a month. ",

            "answer_text": " The short answer is: The sky is the limit! This is a story from my personal experience about poor quality videos that made me $4300+ in 5 months. A few years ago I found out about a method that was about making presentation videos on YouTube. The main pillars of this method were quantity & Amazon Affiliates. The method is simple as it can be.1) Make a YouTube channel. 2) Make an Amazon Affiliate account.3) Search for any products that cost more than $100. You can find plenty of them at Your Daily Niche website. Make a list of them in excel with a product name and link. 4) When the list is ready, start with the first product. Lets make a video. Go to YouTube and click upload video, choose make a slideshow (there isn't this option anymore). I uploaded all the pictures from the product link at Amazon, put a background music from the ones YouTube suggested for free, make the video at least 30 seconds long. While the video uploads in the title you put the Product title (exactly as it is on Amazon). In the description I wrote something like: Special discount on PRODUCT, click here to get it: LINK. In tags just copy the product title.You are probably asking what should you do if there is no discount? Don't worry, it doesn't matter. All you have to get is the click to the product. The cookies will do the rest if the buyer buys anything within 24h. Also, most of the products on Amazon has some sort of discount.5) Done. It took me about 5 minutes for each video to be uploaded. Why such a poor quality video be profitable you ask? Because when you upload large quantities of products like vacuum cleaners, TV's, gardening tools etc, many of them have little competition with their exact keywords. That means you can get to Google page #1 easily with your video for this product. Also, people tend to look up on Google products that they are willing to buy on Amazon, especially the ones that cost at least $100. The first 200-300 videos I uploaded myself. When I saw that it took off and it works, I hired 3 people who I would pay about $0,15$ per video upload. The only thing that I had to do was to provide them excel files with affiliate links to products and the name of the product. Here are my earnings from March to November thanks to this method. All in all, I made $4300+ from this method. Not bad eh?     What can you learn from this story? Everything is possible! You just need to be dedicated to what you are doing. If you\u2019ll do quality videos, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll earn a lot more than I did. Good Luck! ",
