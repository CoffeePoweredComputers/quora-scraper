            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really like comparing the two countries but I would have to personally say that I believe that Kpop is better because I feel like Jpop concepts are way to peppy for me. Personally, I would really love it if Jpop had much more bolder concepts instead of the cute, peppy concept. This is just my opinion. Also, it would be more interesting and cool if more Jpop artists could write and compose a few of their own songs. I mean, it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t any but I just hope Jpop will become more open to bolder concepts in the future. ",

Personally, I think Kpop singers are better than Jpop singers because I don't know a Jpop singer that can sing like Sohyang can. Also, there aren\u2019t really any Jpop singers that are able to give you the feels like Kim Feel can. ",
