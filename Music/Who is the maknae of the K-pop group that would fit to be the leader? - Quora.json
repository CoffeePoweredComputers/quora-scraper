He has amazing leadership abilities in Jus2 and GOT7 as a whole and he takes wonderful care of his fellow members. I.M  This man loves his member so damn much. In a lot of their international interviews, Changkyun, being fluent in English, steps up. It\u2019s actually heartwarming to see, he would definitely be an amazing leader. Taemin  Taemin would also be a nice leader. It was actually kinda funny that he declined being the leader of SuperM, I think it would have fit him perfectly. He\u2019s a very caring and aware person. ~fm ",

He is very good at English and even without talking he makes me respect and fear him a bit so he fits the leader image the best. Taemin from Shinee. Well, all of Shinee\u2019s members are cool but he is the most interesting and classy member to me, besides his amazing dancing skills makes him even more badass so\u2026yeah lol ",
