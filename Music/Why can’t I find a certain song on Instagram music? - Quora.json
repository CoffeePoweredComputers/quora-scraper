            "answer_text": "I run into this problem A LOT. It\u2019s so annoying because all the irritating pop hits are all on there but the good music is hidden. Luckily, I may have a few hacks. 1: If you download Spotify on your computer, you can choose specific songs to play instead of a playlist. You could maybe play those in the background of an insta video. You can also do this after finding a good YouTube video. 2. You can definitely LEGALLY find it and download it on a LEGAL website. Definitely LEGAL, mind you. You could play it in the background I guess. 3. I don\u2019t know if Instagram lets you add link to a story, but if it does then it\u2019s a good option. 4. Name the song on your story so people can listen to it. 5. If none of this works, write a complaint on Instagram? I mean, it\u2019s not that big of a deal to do that but go off I guess. I appreciate good music, NS ",
