            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it makes people smarter intellectually, BUT I do believe it may score some points with whomever hears a person stepping outside of their usual musical tastes. Trying to impress someone with how intelligent one is is one of the most difficult tricks to accomplish - if the person knows more about the subject - or realizes you don\u2019t know anything about it - say goodbye to that phone number/job/etc. you were hoping to get! Yes, I know I just said something really really shallow. Trying to impress when looking for a date is quite shallow (it sounds like someone isn\u2019t confident in their own abilities) and attempting to get a job, well, I\u2019ve never done that for an interview so I don\u2019t know if it is done! Still\u2026people think others think too much about other people (yeah, good luck figuring out that phrase - I typed it and it\u2019s giving me trouble! If anyone knows how to translate that I beg you to do so) when most folks are too caught up in their own misgivings and low self opinions to think about how \u201csmart\u201d someone is. Plus I wonder how many people, when listening to someone exercise their brains think, \u201cWow! They\u2019re so smart! I\u2019m way out of their league so I better just leave them alone and let them find someone who\u2019s as smart as they are!\u201d I have a reputation among my friends for being tangential. I am also kind of a joke savant. I say these things to warn you all of the joke of which this question reminds me: Did you know beer makes you smarter? It made Bud wiser. Apologies. ",

            "answer_text": "There's very little scientific support for the theory that listening to classical music makes you smarter. But making the leap for the moment that there's some truth in it, I would hazard a guess that by \u201cclassical\u201d most people mean \u201csymphonic\u201d music (i.e. music played by an orchestra), and so the complexity and variety of the timbres produced by a whole orchestra of instruments playing together and in various combinations is stimulating to the brain\u2019s neural pathways and promotes the visualization of the music - because most symphonic music is instrumental, our mind tends to invent a \u201cstory\u201d to tie in with the music - like a film score. That process of \u201cimagineering\u201d worlds based on music, creates new neural pathways and could make the brain more adept at creative thought. It's only a model - there's so far no proof that listening to classical music is any more effective at this than listening to rap or pop music, so we need to prove the adage first. ",
