            "answer_text": "It depends on what you're looking for. If you need a site that has data that can't normally be quantified, Last.fm is the best. It works by tracking its 40 million users' listening habits, leading to information like common song/album/artist descriptions and related songs. Obviously, data is better for bigger releases, but here's the page for \"Let It Be\": http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Let+It+Be/Let+It+Be If you're looking for a more traditional database, try MusicBrainz. It's kind of like Wikipedia for albums; the users list and form relationships between every release by an artist. They even go so far as to catalog bootlegs. ",

Discogs is a Database and Marketplace for Music on Vinyl, CD, Cassette and More Discogs is somewhat similar to Musicbrainz; with a bit more technical data (more detailed credits, barcodes, CD/vinyl runout markings, etc.) While these two sites are great for finding out information about a certain piece of music for cataloguing purposes, they do not feature extensive reviews (Musicbrainz just has a 5-star rating system AFAIK, but Discogs has a review system in place), or similar music reccomendations.
