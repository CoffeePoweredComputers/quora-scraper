The only and I mean ONLY way to protect yourself is to wrap your head in a silver foil helmet . Many people favour the Costco \u201cKirkland\u201d brand. Some people used to use metal buckets but the rays got in through the eye holes which clearly needed to be cut in to the bucket for health and safety reasons ",

            "answer_text": "Most people who write about this neglect the most powerful mind control of all: that willed by the subject themselves. MK-ULTRA\u2019s most shocking secret was that torture and coercion do NOT produce effective mind control: sadists only do what scratches their sexual itch, not a coolheaded \u201cinterview\u201d, people being tortured tell the operator what they think they want them to say, psychedelics and other drugs are about as effective in eliciting responses as the equivalent in alcohol (that is, disinhibition) and the notion of a \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d was more of an intriguing theoretical than truth. Also remember that almost everything we know about the project came from the CIA itself, as the result of congressional hearings. The Modern Illuminati doesn\u2019t subject people to mind control. It teaches it. That\u2019s scary enough without all the edgelord creepypasta, I think. ",
