            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to throw a curve ball: Is it OK for Christians to listen to non-Christian music, by non-Christians, when the non-Christian music sounds more like Christian music than most Christian music? Here\u2019s an example:  This is a prayer. It\u2019s a prayer performed by two gentlemen of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. Still works for me. Nice guys by the way. I got to meet them once. Here\u2019s another:  This is a bit further afield. But again, it sounds like a prayer. It plays very well in a Christian context, but, so far as I\u2019m aware, Alan Parsons and friends are not Christians. And, again, works for me. One more:  This is Genesis. Sounds like a testimony. Each of these songs was instrumental in getting me through some very strange times, well back in the day. They still reverberate with me now. You can dismiss these. That last one could just as easily be a love song. But interesting choice of language, the religious overtones are pretty inescapable. Alan Parsons is singing about ancient Egypt; Seals and Croft follow Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, not exactly your go-to guide on Evangelical/ Charismatic/ Protestant doctrine. So feel free to dismiss. But before doing so, let\u2019s compare with a bit of \u201cChristian\u201d music first:  OK as far as it goes. Predictable, pedestrian, formulaic, but OK. Speaking personally, this does nothing for me. The way I see it, God will use what He chooses to use. If He wants a voice, he has plenty to choose from. At certain moments in my life, I\u2019ve found comfort in the weirdest places. And, aesthetically, musically, objectively, that last one doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the first three. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: I don\u2019t see why not. Long answer: While I very much understand and appreciate the value of sacred music, I don\u2019t believe that the personal values of specific performers necessarily affect the sacredness or presentation of any musical number. While it\u2019s certainly possible that non-Christians might choose to desecrate or mock a piece of Christian music, it\u2019s hardly a guarantee. I think that if a non-Christian individual performs a piece of Christian music in an appropriate and respectful way, that those who hear the performance can still be as uplifted and benefited as had the performer been a Christian. And really, I don\u2019t think God draws the kind of distinction mentioned in the question anyway. If people mock God, that\u2019s between them and Him. If they praise Him\u2014regardless their professed faith\u2014I\u2019m confident that He accepts any sincere offering of love from His children. All the best. ",
