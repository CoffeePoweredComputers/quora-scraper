            "answer_text": "As far as I know (as a music educator), there is no study that finds the practice of one instrument to be more advantageous to brain activity than another. You will find individuals suggesting instruments that they play or love to be better for this or that part of brain function and, of course, several years ago, we had the similar anecdotally-based practice of pregnant women playing Mozart around the house during their pregnancies to hopefully raise their babies\u2019 IQ\u2019s. This has been debunked, along with the idea that the study of music somehow increases ones\u2019 performance in math, science, spatial reasoning, tennis, spelunking, and other endeavors (for starters, see this article: Muting the Mozart effect ). I really do wish I could say as a teacher of music that music is good for the brain, but the data just doesn\u2019t seem to exist. So, to objectively extend this to a given instrument is nigh impossible. Association of an instrument with an individual is just that: an argument by way of association and should never convince anyone of anything. A subjective appreciation for a given instrument is simply not indicative of higher (or lower) IQ score. I have known some violinists who were complete imbeciles (apparently, despite Einstein\u2019s appreciation for the instrument) and some absolutely brilliant drummers (just to mention one group of musicians that often gets unfairly maligned for low mental acuity. The \u201cDrummer Joke\u201d is a fixture in professional music circles; virtually every one of these anecdotes deals with the alleged mental denseness of drummers. One drummer I knew had a PhD. in toxicology. I was glad I was on his good side. :-) He used to regale the rest of the band about all the poisons he knew of that could kill a person and not leave a trace). Most people don\u2019t have a particularly high view of the intelligence of the typical electric guitarist, but Brian May, guitarist for Queen, as an astrophysicist, has a PhD. from Imperial College. Mental prowess knows no predilection for a given instrument (and this is before we factor in the concept that cognitive development theorists have for years now spoken about Intelligence Types (rather than attempting to reduce innate intelligence to one single score). BTW, and FWIW (which isn\u2019t much I am so sure), if I had to ignore the near total lack of data to answer this question regarding individual instruments, I\u2019m not sure why anyone would ever think a generally monophonic instrument could ever be the \u201cbest for the brain\u201d. Pianists, organists, and classical guitarists all regularly have to keep track of at least one melody line, accompaniment and/or countermelody (or countermelodies) and a bass line, performing them all in tempo. Very subjectively, I would definitely look for an answer to your question in this direction. In jazz, the art of improvisation could perhaps be considered into the \u201cequation\u201d to determine an answer for this question (most classically-trained musicians simply do not understand how to create a melody on the spot the same way a jazz musician does on a daily basis). But again, there is a paucity of hard data on this subject, so I claim no such authority to make the comment. So basically, if you want, say, a higher math or physics score, go study your math or physics a bit more. If you want to play violin better, go practice your violin. If basketball is your game, go shoot hoops. ",

            "answer_text": "(originally answered: Is Instrument Good For Brain?) Instrument is good for brain! Cognitive functions, recall and even muscle memory greatly benefit from learning an instrument. Playing music benefits the brain more than any other activity. Researchers at Northwestern University found that people who play a musical instrument generally have a greater memory, attention span, and ability to convey emotions. According to the researchers, the brain builds new neural connections (paths for information to travel through your brain) while learning to play music. This increases the brain\u2019s ability to adapt and change. These findings have also helped treat children with disabilities such as dyslexia and autism. Regardless of age, music can help individuals with various health conditions as music therapy is increasingly used \u201cto promote wellness, manage stress, alleviate pain, enhance memory, improve communication, and promote physical rehabilitation\u201d (ScienceDaily). By the way, your voice is also an instrument. Singing can help you immediately get started working that muscle in your head. Here's a video that explains it better than I can.  Though, I suppose, it could be bad for brain at times:  ",
