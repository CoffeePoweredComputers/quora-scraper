            "answer_text": "Well, popular wisdom is that the \u201cbeast\u201d is cocaine abuse. As I said in a previous post on this topic, Don Henley has said publicly that the song is about the journey from innocence to experience, so use that to nuance the meaning if you like. An interesting side note is that the \u201csteely knives\u201d was a nod to Steely Dan who referenced the Eagles in \u201cEverything You Did\u201d. The lyric is I believe, \u201cturn up the Eagles, the neighbors are listening\u201d, written by Walter Becker when arguing loudly with his girlfriend, who was a fan. ",
