            "answer_text": "As a measurement, an IQ score is meaningless and as a method of measurement, IQ testing is meaningless. But as a method of judgment, and as a score (a judgment), both IQ testing and an IQ score are meaningful. Is there a difference between scoring and measuring? Do you measure a thing\u2019s appearance or score it? Given that a building stands fifty feet tall, how pretty is the building? I can say that I find tall buildings pretty, and that the building is average. Given that the correct answer to a puzzle occurred 30 seconds after it was presented to Jimmy, does Jimmy have good intelligence? I can say that the quicker a person answers the question, the better their intelligence, and that Jimmy\u2019s intelligence is average based on the \u201cdifficulty\u201d I\u2019ve assigned to the puzzle. Some might say you can measure the speed of intelligence, or the speed at which intelligence is used to solve a problem. But the duration of time between a question and its correct response doesn\u2019t have a speed. The answer doesn't travel a distance in x time. It\u2019s just a duration (a response time), and other than speed, IQ testers can't claim to be measuring anything else. I suppose they could claim they measure the speed at which neurons fire, but neurons don\u2019t take 30 seconds, or even a second, and it's not possible to know how many neurons are being measured, or what distance (if any) is traveled. They could claim they measure a frequency at which neurons fire or an intensity at which they fire, but the first of these is another way of measuring/counting response times, and the second clearly is not measurement. So, how is a response time a measurement of any aspect of intelligence? A response time in IQ testing is not the speed or quickness of intelligence, since intelligence doesn't travel a distance. It's strictly a response time. You might say that it\u2019s the response time of intelligence, but this is just another way of saying a response happened. If you say a response time is how quickly intelligence responded, you've only described response times, not intelligence. One can only judge a person\u2019s intelligence as better or worse based on response times. For example, Jimmy recognized the pattern in 30 seconds, which matches the average of 90% of test takers. The tester must assign Jimmy\u2019s performance a score based upon this fact. While 30 seconds is a measured response time, it is not a measurement of Jimmy\u2019s intelligence, and neither is the score. I think that scoring is a distinct activity from measuring, and that it relates to the assignment of values (not quantities) to things, behaviors and ideas \u2014 values such as correct or incorrect, true or false, pretty or ugly, right or wrong, and scaled values, such as your pain on a scale from 0 to 10 or your performance on a scale of 0 to 130 and above. An IQ test, like the pain scale, uses numerals, and the numerals do not represent quantities but qualities \u2014 the severity and/or\u201d level\u201d of those qualities. Following this logic, an IQ score (being called a \u201cscore\u201d) is not a measurement but a score/judgment, an assignment of value to a person\u2019s performance. By being a judgment, that doesn't necessarily make it a matter of perspective, opinion or debate. We score the truth-value of arguments as true or false, for example, and a statement\u2019s truth-value is not an opinion. Being based on theories of intelligence and cognitive ability, it isn't pathological judgement, but IQ testing must be judgment of another sort. I think the reason people mistake an IQ score as a measurement has to do with a conceptual metaphor, a metaphor that\u2019s useful insofar as it forms a coherent concept of intelligence \u2014 the metaphor being that thought is a body. A body is extended in space and so has dimensions you can measure. This metaphor clearly organizes the structure of IQ testing, and it's easier to conceptualize intelligence as a object with measurable dimensions than as a formless abstraction. But it\u2019s incorrect to take this metaphor literally. For one thing, when something is measured on several occasions, its measurement doesn't vary dependent on moods, rapport with the measurer, income, anxiety, etc. It varies because of physical changes, such as weight gain or physical growth. When something is measured, there is no question of what is being measured (e.g., what is IQ a measurement of?). The same is not always true for what is being judged. If an IQ score is not a measurement, and measurement is distinct from scoring, then an IQ score doesn't represent anything about the brain, and it doesn't represent a physically determined characteristic. This means that a person's score depends on other factors, such as mood, motivation, distractability, etc., insofar as their biology does not determine their performance. A high IQ score also doesn\u2019t mean you are actually smarter than the average of 97% of the population. It can only tell you that, at the time that you took the test, your performance was scored better than the average of 97% of people who took the test at different times than you did, under different circumstances and possibly for different reasons. To be brief, a high IQ score means that on this day you were good at solving a particular set of puzzles. That\u2019s not particularly helpful to you in life, but maybe it makes you feel good for a little while. ",

            "answer_text": "I did psychometric testing for 20 years and here\u2019s my take. In the 60s when I was in grad school, the clinical definition of intelligence was \u201cthe ability to discern similarities and differences\u201d which cannot be accurately determined by a generalized numerical value such as IQ. Those tests are just not comprehensive enough to be of much value except perhaps to provide bragging rights for the class wise-ass. If you really want to know what your intellectual values are, spend a day and a half and pay $600 to take the comprehensive tests offered by the Johnson O\u2019Connor Foundation which puts a numerical value on 19 aptitudes (inborn talents) which compose \u201cintelligence\u201d - along with lifetime institutional support. This is sooooo much better than the usual crappy tests used by colleges and commercial personnel departments. (Aptitude Testing and Research since 1922) The result is a comparative graphing of your talents that you can use for the rest of your life to guide you toward occupational and social successes leading to genuine feelings of accomplishment. It\u2019s actually one of the most life-enriching things I\u2019ve ever discovered - which includes allowing me to shut down a few class wise-asses - Yaaaaaaa! Btw, I get no benefit whether you do this or not - except for a good feeling if you let me know you took the tests. Best of luck. ",
