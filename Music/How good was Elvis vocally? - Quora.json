            "answer_text": "Elvis was a true natural with unbelievable vocal skills. No one ever managed to match him \u2026 except maybe one man, a South African singer of the 1960s and \u201970s called Andr\u00e9, one of the country\u2019s first true pop stars. His real name was Basil Schmidt and I met him in a residential hotel in Johannesburg around 1995, we stayed friends for years. He still had a suitcase of his old press cuttings and programmes; and he had some documents to back up a truly extraordinary story of when he sent some recordings of his Elvis covers to the King himself in Graceland. He actually played me some of his Elvis covers, I can\u2019t find any of them online, this song, Michaelangelo\u2014which was a Eurovision runner-up, a Swedish number, which he actually performed with the original Swedish band\u2014was one of his last big hits, it does give you some idea of his voice.  What happened when he sent his recording to Graceland\u2014he had taken great care to get professional backing\u2014was that the recording was literally sent back to him, with a message saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t know why you are sending us recordings of Elvis, we already have them.\u201d At this point, a South African comedian and performer called Terry Lester was on his way to America, and was going to meet Elvis at Graceland, according to Andr\u00e9; so he gave him the recordings again, and said, listen, just go and tell them that this is actually me singing. So he did. Andr\u00e9 then showed me a short song Lester had written, called \u201cMessage From the King\u201d. This had actually been printed in a programme somewhere. It was the story about how these recordings got to Elvis, the punchline being: \u201cGive him a message from the King: This sounds just like me.\u201d And in fact, according to Andr\u00e9, Elvis\u2019s exact words to Lester were, \u201cTell Andr\u00e9 he sounds just like me.\u201d Again, I\u2019m just going on his word, but Andr\u00e9 insisted that this is the only time Elvis ever endorsed an imitator. Maybe that would be a good question some day. Andr\u00e9 did have an extraordinary voice, it was seamless across the octaves, after he won a talent competition he was given some operatic training, and was told that his voice was truly unusual in not having any falsetto \u201cbreak\u201d of any kind. Andr\u00e9 died in 2008, he was quite a character, an international trader and a diplomat, he ran the Polish-South Africa Chamber of Commerce, he was always asking me if I knew someone who wanted to buy 100 right-hand-drive Mercedes-Benzes or something like that. I was always trying to persuade him to make a comeback, and he always said he needed to fix his teeth first. But I used to hear him letting loose a burst of song sometimes in the evenings at Heartbreak Hotel, as I used to call Queenscrest Residential, and it gave me serious goosebumps. When all is said and done: Elvis probably still has the single most distinctive voice that ever hit this planet. I bought a CD of Elvis Christmas duets late last year, with all sorts of people, and I was amazed at the sensitivity of his voice to the other performers. There\u2019s a story of a famous Christmas special that was done virtually acoustically, sitting around on a few boxes, with Elvis singing as if he\u2019s with a few pals. I\u2019ve tried to find it online without success. But apparently the closer you got to his natural voice, the better it sounded. That is emphatically not true of a lot of modern-day singers. (Apparently his manager, the legendary Tom Parker, was so worried about this low-key, non-flashy performance that he insisted on being given all the tickets, failed to distribute a single one, and at the last minute, the crew were handing out tickets to one of the greatest Elvis performances ever, to anyone who happened to be in the parking lot.) No, no, Elvis was very special. But I\u2019ll tell you one story that Andr\u00e9 told me about him that checks out. Andr\u00e9 was into all kinds of esoteric books, he gave me a whole lot, I still have them, including all the Zacharia Sitchin books, I\u2019d never heard of him until this point. I only had one book with me, so I lent it to him, and I swear he went pale as a ghost. It was Cheiro\u2019s Book of Numbers, I liked having it around (I was travelling very light at the time). He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for this book for years, do you know Elvis never went anywhere without it. He would put it down just before he went on stage, and pick it up when he came off. He never took a decision without consulting it.\u201d So I was intrigued to see that you can find a copy of Cheiro\u2019s book, actually annotated by Elvis himself. It\u2019s up for auction, any takers? ",

            "answer_text": "The best summary here comes from Henry Pleasants in The Great American Popular Singers (1980). He states insightfully: \u201cElvis had a vocal range of about two octaves and a third, compared to about the one octave range of the average pop singer, and was best described as a high baritone. He could hit full-voiced high Gs and As that an opera singer might envy. He was a naturally assimilative musician with an acute sense of style.\u201d It\u2019s easy to assume Elvis peaked early, especially if you prefer the image of the younger, healthier Elvis. But, as John Robertson observed in his book The Complete Guide To Elvis Presley (Omnibus Press, 1994), \u201chis voice had grown rounder, even fruitier, with age.\u201d You can hear this in any number of songs towards the end of his life. Biographer Albert Goldman and others have asserted that Elvis\u2019s voice deserted him when his looks began to fail and his weight rose, but this is a popular myth. Elvis\u2019s voice remained colourful and supremely capable of negotiating his epic Las Vegas ballads like \u2018You Gave Me A Mountain,\u2019 \u2018Hurt\u2019 and \u2018How Great Thou Art\u2019 right to the very end. EDIT: I have another quote that agrees with my earlier post, even down to the reference to his vocal range. It comes from another great book covering Elvis\u2019s career. In Heartbreak Hotel: The Life And Music Of Elvis Presley, Robert Matthew-Walker says: \u201cPresley\u2019s vocal range was exceptional \u2013 amazingly so for an untrained singer. It ranged from Low F in the bass register to top B Flat and B in the tenor range. This is over two octaves: most people can only managed just over one octave. Quite apart from the range of Presley\u2019s voice (and this range remained with him throughout his life, a fact proved by his recordings) the equally surprising thing was that its quality and distinctive timbre remained constant throughout this range. This is also exceptional and quite the most conclusive proof \u2013 if any were needed \u2013 that Elvis Presley possessed a natural gift for singing which was completely and utterly rare. For if it were not \u2013 where are all the other Elvis Presleys?\u201d  ",
