            "answer_text": "As were all of the Beatles he was mostly self taught by ear. However that's not to say they didn't have any help along the way. Ian James, a school mate of Paul's and very good friend taught him his first few chords, Paul and George learned new chords together, and of course Paul taught John how to tune his and use actual guitar chords after having been taught banjo chords by his mum Julia. I only ever recall Ringo being given a drum in hospital not being taught. So I suppose Ian gets the beginning credit for Paul's learning guitar. It was something he's never seemed to stop doing, learning to play new instruments.  Ian James gets credit for teaching Paul McCartney his very first guitar chords as they sunbathed in the McCartney back garden on summer days. Photo taken by none other than Macca himself. ",
