            "answer_text": "There are some Asian style karaoke places that have private rooms that you rent by the hour and can sing your heart out. You can also access karaoke videos on YouTube and practice at home. As they say, the way to Carnegie Hall is practice, practice, practice! Eventually, you will have the confidence to sing in front of an audience. Of course, the liquid courage (alcohol) mentioned by others helps too!  ",

            "answer_text": "Karaoke is all about reading the lyrics on the screen while singing. If you focus on the screen, you won\u2019t notice the other people in the room. Getting encouragement and applause is a great feeling and lessens your shyness if you continue to sing. But if you can\u2019t seem to get over your shyness, get a home karaoke machine like a magic mic and sing at home. Karaoke machines are pretty pricey, you\u2019re better off having fun at a karaoke bar or joining in a karaoke night event ",
