            "answer_text": "I most definitely would not worship the devil no matter what he had to offer. I have chosen to take no part in any worldly affairs or the system as it is arranged at present (although in my earlier life, before committing to God\u2019s Word and His kingdom, I participated in, and was absorbed by the political process, so I am quite familiar with it). However, as the devil is most definitely pulling the strings here on earth (please see the book of Matthew chapter 4, verses 1 through 11) many people - especially world leaders - are being manipulated as pawns of \u2018\u2018the wicked one.\u2019 Just take a look at the state of things world wide; what else can explain why human beings are desperate for answers, solutions, racial justice, true peace and harmony, trust, real lasting joy, an end to world hunger, wars, and poverty, and have a longing for cohesive families? For a moment, think about this question from this perspective: many individuals have made incredible amounts of money, garnered amazing political, military, and/or commercial power, and literally have endless amounts of \u2018the world\u2019 In bank accounts, real estate, stocks and countless investments. What has been the result in most cases? This issue is best understood by looking in on one of the oil tycoon J. Paul Getty\u2019s last interviews. This is what he said: \u201cI am the most miserable man I know.\u201d He went on to explain that his family was in shambles, he could not trust anyone, could not maintain a happy marriage, needed guards around the clock, and could not even \u2018get out of (his business and lifestyle)\u2019 - although he did not elaborate as to why he could not \u2018escape\u2019 it. In the mid-1970s when the interview was published, Mr. Getty was earning $180,000 every hour - ON A 24-HOUR CLOCK! He had so much that he could not even come close to utilizing even a portion of it. The fact that he was highly successful did not make him a bad person. However, he was literally a vistim of all that worldly \u2018\u2018success.\u2019 Now I am not denegrating this man and his memory nor do I delight in what was a disturbing dilemma, And there is nothing wrong with working hard and smart, and making a good living for yourself and your loved ones. But the story is all too familiar; it is far from an isolated incident. It tends to demonstrate that the more people acquire, the more trouble they have. So why \u2018worship the beast\u2019 In exchange for \u2018the world and everything in it\u2019 even if it was not disgusting to do so? Incidentally, I know the question did not go where I am about to go, but when you read just those 11 verses of chapter 4 in the book of Matthew with an objective, open mind, you cannot help but see that the Bible has the answers to our situation here on earth. And that is still another reason one can trust what is found in that book, and rest assured it is a message from our Creator (as written under divine inspiration by some 39 different people. The majority of them did not meet each other nor even live in the same era over the thousands of years they wrote it. and yet, it all harmonizes while staying true to the main themes). How else can one explain the rather dire, sad state of this world, and how can the biblical account be disputed? It explains why otherwise well-educated, and (at least a few) well-intentioned politicians - so-called \u2018leaders\u2019 - lawyers, PHDs, and by all accounts somewhat \u2018normal\u2019 groups and individuals act and reason like 5-year olds! Again, my view, my choice, my life; I respect decent people everywhere no matter what they choose to believe. Thanks for the question, and for reading my view. I welcome and encourage further comments as long as they are respectful. Be well! ",
