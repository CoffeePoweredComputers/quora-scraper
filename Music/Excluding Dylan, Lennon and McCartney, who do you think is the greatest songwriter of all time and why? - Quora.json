            "answer_text": "Is it possible that there is simply no way to answer this question? We have so many extraordinary people to choose from who are brilliant for as many different talents: lyrics, melody, story-telling, feel-good hooks, pathos, humor, commentary, complexity, etc., etc. I probably couldn\u2019t give you a definitive top 5 if my life depended on it. And my answers would probably change daily, and inevitably I\u2019d forget someone the first time, be reminded, and have to change my list again. But as of this moment, here are the people that jump to mind: Cole Porter \u2014 for perfect melody and timeless lyrics, filled with wit and heart.Rogers and Hammerstein \u2014 because of perfect, lush, fantastical songs that you never forget, and your grandparents never forgot.Smokey Robinson \u2014 for merging true soul with pop economy and making it accessible to anyone with ears.Andy Partridge, leader of UK band XTC \u2014 for carrying on the Beatles tradition of mixing punk, pop, ancient folk music, pub sing-alongs, and classical music into something greater than the sum of its parts, all with heart and intelligence.Chuck Berry \u2014 for making R and B music and country music a single American music and authentic modern folk poetry.Carole King \u2014 for capturing the experience of post-war youth in America and beyond, and showing that divisions between class, religion, geography, race only keep us from being in the moment, dancing joyfully, together.Lieber and Stoller \u2014 ditto.Stevie Wonder \u2014 for exuberant, positive, funky soul that goes straight to the heart.Kate Bush \u2014 for creating a genre that only one person has ever been able to master, and telling compelling, complicated stories about strange and wonderful characters in three-minute symphonies, and for pulling from every musical tradition but erasing all the lines between where one begins and another ends. Sort of like Andy Partridge/XTC in that she takes the trajectory begun by the Beatles to places no one thought existed, and probably much farther than XTC. Like Joni Mitchell, below, she demands a close, close listen for full effect.Joni Mitchell \u2014 for pushing the boundaries of meter, key, and language, taking it to its emotive essence, rules be damned, in the tradition of the modernists of the early 20th Century. Like them, she broke the rules, but never left chaos or sloppiness. Instead, she created something more complex, more exacting, reaching ruthlessly into the soul and demanding your attention.Simon and Garfunkel \u2014 for starting with the earnest, revivalist simplicity of American folk and transforming it into a transcendent, soothing balm of melody and lyrics, yet never pulling an emotional punch. (EDIT: someone commented that technically, Garfunkel didn\u2019t contribute to the writing of these songs. That is true, though I think his harmonies and arrangements are a key aspect of what makes those songs so emotional, at least for now. It\u2019s a wobbler, I think.)Kirsty MacColl \u2014 for being the greatest songwriter most people have never heard of, and someone cut down before she could reach her full greatness. I reserve the right to include her in this list because it\u2019s my answer, and you can answer differently :) A woman who started her musical life as the \u201cQueen of the Covers,\u201d and then quickly became what other people called a female Randy Newman (who should probably be on this list somewhere too). I call her the patron saint of brainy women for her lyrics, which is a very rare thing in pop music, but her melodies are equally capable of eliciting the same feeling that she has peeked into your soul and is breaking the hard news to you. Check out Tropical Brainstorm, her last album before she died in a diving accident, or her penultimate album, Titanic Days. Really, who else could write the line, \u201cWho\u2019d have thought I\u2019d have as much fun with an anonymous Dutchman,\u201d and make it swing?That's today\u2019s list. I\u2019ll probably need to keep changing it as I keep thinking of someone else it would be a crime to exclude. Regardless, though, what I see in my list and most everyone else\u2019s is that all our \u201cgreatest songwriters\u201d have one thing in common: they take ordinary forms, merge them with other ordinary forms, ignore the established rules, and bring us something utterly new, yet timeless.

            "answer_text": "After Lennon-McCartney, who even comes close? Who has written more than even 5 fantastic tunes? To qualify as great - and this is just a way of defining greatness - the song must have something going for it that makes it unusually popular for its tunefulness and presentation for at least 20 years, and then a new generation of listeners should also agree that it is outstanding on the same merits. This helps clear out all those songs that a generation gets stoked on, but everyone else \u201chad to be there\u201d to appreciate. Lennon and McCartney (more accurately, the Beatles) pass the intergenerational test with flying colours. And their catalogue\u2019s sheer quality, volume and variety of tunes gives them several dozen memorable songs. They were trying to keep up with Bach\u2019s production, according to McCartney. Once they found out that he wrote a new song for the church choir to sing every Sunday, they thought that was a good pace to try to keep up with! Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road, Across the Universe, Hey Jude, Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, I am the Walrus, Because, amd The Abbey Road Medley are just a SAMPLE of their more famous songs, and these are just from their later period. Well behind the Beatles - although with more intricate embelishments in his melodies - is Chopin. What a great tunesmith! Maybe he has 10 songs that rank right up there. Richard Rogers sure wrote a lot of hummable tunes. I don\u2019t know all his songs, but at least 4 of the following songs are really excellent tunes and the others are very good: Blue Moon, Climb Every Mountain, Do-Re-Mi, Edelweiss, Favourite Things, Getting to Know You, Happy Talk, Maria, My Funny Valentine, Oh What a Beautiful Morning, Sixteen Going on Seventeen, Some Enchanted Evening, Sound of Music, You Took Advantage of Me, You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. I left a few out that are also famous, but I don\u2019t find as good. I like Bach, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, but they didn\u2019t have the same number of big tunes. They sure had some good ones, but I don\u2019t rank them as great tunesmiths.. Tchaikovsky had a few GREAT original tunes - Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-Flat Minor Op. 23 has a better tune than anything ever written by the Beatles, in my opinion - but he also just worked over some folk tunes. There are artists with a handful of really nice tunes, like George Gershwin and Hoagy Carmichael. And there are many many others who have at least 2 or 3 stellar songs. Paul Simon and Carole King, for example. So many others. I don\u2019t think that Brian Wilson has enough really strong tunes, nor Billy Joel, Steven Stills, Jagger/Richards, and the myriad of others that have 2\u20133 amazing songs. In my opinion - and millions would beg to differ - Dylan didn\u2019t write enough great tunes to rank as a fantastic songwriter. If his songs didn\u2019t have any lyrics, would they be strong enough tunes? There are many great lyrical songs from the 1800s where the tune wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep the song alive. I\u2019m likely forgetting a few. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it\u2019s either Bowie or Ron Mael of Sparks. Bowie was phenomenal in the sense that he would recycle ideas and lyrics to tell what he was going through at the time. I guess you could say he referenced himself. For example, he used the same character, \u201cMajor Tom,\u201d from Space Oddity in Ashes to Ashes. In Ashes to Ashes, he explains that Major Tom\u2019s a junkie, referring to the state he was in when he wrote Space Oddity. He also nonchalantly references other things going on in the world, and you can really understand it when you go through his song lyrics one line at a time and actually think about what each line means. All in all, he had awesome, extraordinary concepts that no normal brain could think of. As for Ron Mael, his lyrics are so witty, clever and humorous. Many people think of Sparks as more of a novelty band, with their only big hit being \u201cThis Town Ain\u2019t Big Enough for the Both of us.\u201d However, in songs like \u201cPopularity,\u201d the lyrics are written with such a carefree and mindless way, that it adds a comedic effect to the song. For example, a part of the lyrics goes, \u201cWe\u2019ll meet the rest of our friends at a place that\u2019s called\u2026I forget what it\u2019s called, but it\u2019s really great.\u201d Another example of this would be in \u201cWhen I\u2019m With You.\u201d The lyrics express the same sense of carefree-ness when not being able to think of lyrics, but it works so well that I couldn\u2019t imagine it being any other way. \u201cIt\u2019s that break in the song when I should say something special\u2026but the pressure is on and I can\u2019t think of nothing special..Not when I\u2019m with you.\u201d Not to mention, some of the songs are based off of obscure ideas, like \u201cHere Comes Bob\u201d is about a guy named Bob who hits people with his car. It\u2019s that super eccentric stuff that I admire so greatly in music. ",

            "answer_text": "Prince might not be the best ever, but he certainly has a place in the pantheon. His lyricism and musicianship place him a cut above. Michael Jackson was also a major talent in the field, as well as Stevie Wonder, for similar reasons. I don\u2019t spend a lot of time considering hierarchies of this kind, but I think it is at least very possible that despite any crimes he (probably\u2014no\u2014definitely) committed, Michael Jackson may be the greatest all-around entertainer in history. It doesn\u2019t bother me that Lennon and McCartney are excluded, but excluding Dylan seems a bit much. Oh, and despite the fact that I\u2019m not a fan, Billy Joel is one of the very best. But then there\u2019s Stephen Foster, Cole Porter, and a myriad of others from ages gone by\u2026. ",

What about Michael Stipe of REM? What about Joni Mitchell or Dolly Parton? What about Don Henley or Glenn Frey? Who compares to Carole King? So there is not one. Dylan and then Lennon and McCartney are standouts but in the end it is personal taste as well as the ability to realize we need all of these songs to be complete. I love so many songs, from Tchaikovsky, to Beatles to Stephen Sondheim, to Pink Floyd. I wouldn't choose a best but I would choose a favorite. But you did not ask that. ",

There is always this argument that was George equal to John and Paul? Well, it's a bit technical to say, the question should be like did he get similar numbers of songs to write? So if we consider whatever amount of songs he wrote for the band, he still managed wrote three most famous Beatles songs.His solo career gives testimonials how great he was as a songwriter. I find it annoying when a particular artist is hailed as the greatest songwriter, but the majority of the songs he wrote were \u201clove songs.\u201d Seriously is this how one is considered the greatest? George Harrison wrote a wide variety of songs. He wrote spiritual, philosophical, romantic, erotic, satire, humorous, political, psychedelic, revolutionary, social and sad songs. His lyrics were more profound than what John and Paul wrote, who mostly wrote love songs.Is there any artist who has this wide variety of songs like George Harrison? ",

American singer, songwriter, actor. Put out four PERFECT albums. With influences from folk, rock, Brecht-Weill, Rodgers & Hammerstein, etc., most of his songs were about society\u2019s losers - an ex-con finding out his girl has married his best friend (\u201cDown River\u201d which often makes me cry), guy realizing he doesn\u2019t really belong back home anymore (\u201cSonny, Come Home\u201d), a man who lacks, finds and then loses faith (\u201cHis Name Is Andrew\u201d). There are also some tender and deeply lyrical songs of love and hope. He had a unique and brilliant gift. Check him out on YouTube. There\u2019s not much video, just audio, but he\u2019s well worth a listen. Stephen Sondheim: Arguably Broadway\u2019s most brilliant composer. His lyrics are wickedly funny, unbearably poignant, and utterly musical - usually all at the same time. Check out his brilliance in \u201cInto the Woods\u201d (not necessarily the bigscreen version, which had some great stuff cut, but there\u2019s a PBS original-cast version), \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d (again, not the movie, find the PBS version with people who can really sing) and \u201cSunday In the Park With George\u201d (PBS) which has the triple treat of wonderful songs and Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. Google Barbara Cook singing \u201cLosing My Mind,\u201d the best torch song EV ER, or Mandy and Bernadette doing \u201cMove On\u201d at a Sondheim birthday celebration 25 years after they first sang it in \u201cSunday In the Park.\u201d ",

If you consider songwriting to be equal parts words and music, it\u2019s Paul Simon. Simon\u2019s lyrics are amongst the cleverest and most poetic, his music has been amongst the most daring and innovative, and he manages to bring it all together in an appealing, memorable fashion. And he\u2019s worked at a high level throughout his career, if longevity matters. Dylan or Cohen aren\u2019t as musically interesting; McCartney, Billy Joel and Brian Wilson can\u2019t match Simon\u2019s lyrics. Joni Mitchell was adventurous, but she sacrificed any hooks in the process. Sting and Peter Gabriel also pull it all together, but they\u2019re a little bit worse at everything than Paul Simon. ",
