            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy do so many artists use auto-tune? Like is it really necessary?\u201d What exactly do you mean by \u201cnecessary\u201d? What does an art piece need to be considered art? The only thing I believe an artist needs is a message, but even that can be debated. Auto-tuning is one of millions of options an artist can use to express themselves. Just as a guitar, sick beat, funky bass line, music sample, etc. can be used well or not-so-well, so can auto-tuning be used to make potentially great art. The argument has been made that auto-tuning means that artists without as much talent can still make art. First off, there is likely much more to the song than just auto-tuning. The beat and other instruments can amount to 60+ tracks per song that the artist and their team have to manipulate just right to get to sound the way they do. They even had to write that melody line and program it as if it were a synthesizer to get the sound you perceive as auto-tuning. Do you insist on throwing away all of that hard work because of one simple artistic choice? Also, are you actually looking for talent in the art you consume? If so, I would like to know what music you listen to. Is it a series of 2048th-note major scalesat 350 b.p.m, lyric-less singing of the highest and lowest notes perceivable by the human ear, featuring rap breaks so fast their message is beyond comprehension? If not, the artists you listen to have some work to do, those lazy sacks of turds. I suggest listening to The Shagg\u2019s Philosophy of the World and try to replicate it note for note. It would take lots of talent and dedication in order to do so, but do you like it? Also also, isn\u2019t more art better? Why is it such a bad thing that more people now have access to making art? Art ought not to be some sort of elite privilege that only the most prestigious of artists that have already proven themselves to be flawless can create. Art belongs to the people, or it is dead. Not even done yet! If you think auto tuning as a means of artists disguising their shortcomings as a musician is a modern development, you\u2019d be wrong. This has been going on ever since the dawn of recording technology. Every time we break away from our ideological ancestors at the opera, who choose to amplify with only their voice and no electronic assistance, we are making a similar \u201cunnecessary\u201d artistic choice as one would with auto-tune. If auto-tuning as a revolution in pop music can have an argument made against it, couldn\u2019t one do the same with electric guitar in 50\u2019s pop music and onwards? It also distorts the sound, and often makes players sound create and program rhythms and notes they\u2019re not actually playing. The Edge made his healthy share of a billion dollars doing it with U2, are you really gonna fault him for that? Perhaps I\u2019m projecting. If I am, feel free to comment your thoughts. But I see this thought expressed all over then internet and if you aren\u2019t thinking those things, surely a large group of people out there are. If you\u2019ve read any of the content I\u2019ve made in the past few days on Quora, you\u2019ll know that I am primarily a folk artist. I don\u2019t even like auto-tune and I doubt I\u2019ll ever use it. But I dismiss it out of personal preference alone, not in an attempt to separate art from itself to make me feel better. I hope those of you that have read this far will at least know that and judge your fellow artists accordingly\u2026 or, you know, not. Thanks for listening, and I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "About 20 years ago, the backlash against monosodium glutamate (MSG) in food was really mainstream. In the same way that people talk today about avoiding processed sugars or corn syrup, it was a regular talking point even among very educated people that you shouldn\u2019t eat Chinese food if they put MSG in their food (N.B. there\u2019s no evidence that this is true, and it seems like it was probably racist in some fundamental ways). I was a kid at the time, and I remember thinking about integrity/obstinance and how interesting it was that Chinese restaurants chose to continue using MSG even though people clearly would eat there more if they stopped using it. </retrospectiveirony> Of course, while people talked a big game about wanting to avoid MSG, MSG tastes good, and people fundamentally preferred the Chinese food with the MSG than without. So they bought more of it. The same thing is happening with autotune. I get asked this question a lot on Quora (just recently answered a similar question very differently), but as much as people on the internet complain about this, the public generally likes autotune, so it exists. Many singers can sing in tune pretty easily, but autotune has a specific sound, so even the singers who don\u2019t strictly need it use it. Because most people like it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not advocating autotune; I\u2019m an opera singer, and literally the whole point of me is to sing without any sort of editing, EQ, amplification, etc. Obviously I don\u2019t believe in autotune. But it\u2019s so prevalent for the same reason MSG is: people mostly like it. ",
