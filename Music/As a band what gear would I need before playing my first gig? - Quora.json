            "answer_text": "Thanx for the A2A Sean. Most bands these days have the luxury of playing venues with a house PA. With that in mind, I will skip that need. In most of the bands I was part of each player was responsible for their own gear. As a guitar player that\u2019s my guitars, cords, amps, effects if needed, boom mic stand and microphone. I prefer to have my OWN microphone. I rather not taste what everyone else who\u2019s used the house mics before has. Bass player would need the same equipment plus a direct box. Most bass players line thru the PA direct. House engineers prefer they do. Drummer should have his kit, extra sticks, a fan (it gets hot on stage behind a drum kit), headset mic (if he/she does backing vocals) and a set of drum mics & a submixer might also be a good option of owning/bringing. Lead singer has it the easiest..maybe his favorite mic & stand if he/she has one they are fond of using. Make sure you have extra strings, picks, batteries (just in case), cords, extension cords, gaff tape, small tool kit, patch cables and don\u2019t forget your set list. In the last band I gigged regularly with me and the bass players owned a full rack PA system and lighting system. We ONLY provided it if the club/bar didn\u2019t have a house PA. We NEVER admitted to having one up front, especially if we were playing with another band. Not that we didn\u2019t like to share, but we paid for it and if something happened, good luck getting some other band you\u2019ve never met before pay for the repairs/replacement. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on nature of the gig and nature of the band. If you\u2019re playing in a chamber quartet, just show up with your cello. If you\u2019re playing in a more pop or rock type band, you probably should find out what equipment will be available at said gig. EG, if you\u2019re playing at a club with a PA system, you won\u2019t need to bring your own for the vocalist. Its reasonable to bring your instrument, whatever accessories you use (strap, cords, pedals, guitar picks/capo/slides, case, etc), and whatever amplification you\u2019re accustomed to using or may be appropriate for that venue. If you play guitar, its not a bad idea to bring a backup guitar just in case you break a string or something else happens. If you play horns, maybe you can just bring the horn, because you\u2019ll either have enough acoustic volume, or you\u2019ll be playing into a house PA system\u2019s microphone. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not know what instrument you play. But, regardless if you play guitar, bass, or keyboard you would need an amp to go with it if you're playing small venues. The band would also have to have some sort of front end system for at least the vocals. Larger venues you would want to put the instruments as well as the drums through the front end system. you should also have monitors so you can hear what's going on through the front end. I play bass in a band and we don't even use amps. We go directly through the front end. It's a bass player I am delighted not to have to haul around a heavy bass amp. The band Rush used to do the same thing. ",

If you are a member of a band then it will depend on what instrument you\u2019re playing. If you are a bass/guitar player then you need a decent guitar/amp combo. Keyboardist\u2019s need a good multi function keyboard for piano, organ, strings,etc, and a good amp. Drummers need a good set of drums. And you will all need a decent PA. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends where the gig is. Many places have a full back line, so you just bring your instruments. Others require you to bring everything. If you are in a band, everything you use in rehearsal is the minimum requirement to be gig ready. If you don't own it all, buy it. Extra items you may want are extension cords, high rated power strips, and a volt meter to test the outlets at the venue. ",

I did a jam organised by my college which had a grand piano, drum kit, amps and PA supplied. Back in the 1970s it was common for bands, even small ones, to have their own PA and huge speaker stacks and amps, the whole set up. ",
