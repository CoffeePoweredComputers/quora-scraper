            "answer_text": "This is really good question. Now let\u2019s take a look at the players here : We have the GOAT\u2019s out here Biggie and Tupac Two superb lyricists Nas and Eminem And two great rappers , not necessary in rap battles but in general. Now let\u2019s start off with the weakest ones : Its pretty obvious that Jay-Z and Kendrick are the weakest ones on their respective teams. They are not made for confrontation , atleast when it comes to this case . And here i feel Jay- Z has a upper hand as he has one of the greatest disstracks against one of his one teammates Nas Now , when it comes to real battle it pretty much comes down to these four : Biggie , Tupac , Nas and Eminem Its most likely that the pairing will be like this Biggie vs Tupac Eminem vs Nas Now , with all due respect , Biggie is the greatest Rapper of all time no doubt , but when it comes to rap battles , disstracks etc. Tupac has a upper hand . Though this is going to be a tough battle but I think that Tupac will take this one home. So Tupac VS Biggie - Tupac wins Now as dicussed earlier , B/w Jayz and Kendrick , Jayz for sure So Jay-Z VS Kendrick - Jay-Z wins Now coming to the most interesting battle and the most important one , we have two of the greatest lyricist of all times Nas probably has the greatest disstrack ever made \u2018 Ether \u2018 , And Eminem as we know , may not have the best disstrack of all time , but has so many awesome one\u2019s that he can be considered as the greatest confrontation rapper ever , as he was initially a battle rapper , he has experience , but can it hold good against the mighty Nas? Let\u2019s see , Nas has a lot of places where he can take down Eminem , one being his white background . But as we all know , From 8 mile , Em is the kinda guy who can take jabs from the other guy and use it to his own advantage , Same in this case Em really has the quick Vocabulary along with the pure battle style to overpower Nas Now ,this is a really , like really tough competition, I gotta say here it\u2019s almost 50\u201350 , but still if i have to choose one , It has to be Eminem . No disrespect to Nas , he\u2019s awesome , but as a battle rapper em has a upper hand. Still the chances are like 49.9999% Nas and 50.0001 % Eminem. So Nas VS Eminem - Eminem wins . . So now coming to the point who wins this battle , as you can see It\u2019s Team 2pac , Em and Kdot  Now this solely based on my opinion , you guys are free to express your opinions in the Comment section , and also i took like 20 mins out of my day to write this , so if possible please upvote :) And also , my preference of artists among these is gon be like this : [it\u2019s pretty sure who\u2019s gon be first for me :) ] EminemNasTupacBiggieKendrickJay-ZThis is just my opinion so please don\u2019t get offended :) ",

            "answer_text": "We dont Really know how good Kendrick at diss tracks but lets keep it equal to his general songs. JayZ and Kendrick Lamar are the weak ones of their teams. As you can see in the TakeOver JayZ is good. So JayZ over Kendrick. About Biggie and Tupac, both got perfect diss tracks, but Kick In The Door, since Biggie is the only kindaofficial King in the Rap, gets the Job done and Since Biggie Survived the diss track, Hit Em Up didnt. About Nas and Eminem, well\u2026 Em is a battle rapper, Nas is the greatest lyricist. Em is more experinced but Nas can give you some lyrical beating. Eminem has more weakness Nas can attack but Em is wont accept the L if Nas talks about Hailie. Em slightly wins it. But overall Team NY Wins. ",
