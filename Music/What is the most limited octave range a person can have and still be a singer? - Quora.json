            "answer_text": "I like that counter-intuitive question. Not everyone can attain the range of a top opera singer, even with a lot of training. Some people do seem to have a range of just about one octave, yet are successful. Suzanne Vega comes to mind. She has barely any range, yet she\u2019s had some big hits. To be honest, I don\u2019t care much for her voice even though her songs are appealing. I like a sound with more fire and expression, and that involves range. If you don\u2019t have much of a range, you\u2019ll need things that make up for it. You\u2019d need a sound that is at least appealing, even if it\u2019s not dramatic and powerful. I think the most important way to overcome small range is to have very appealing tunes, and Suzanne has that. A small voice needs killer tunes!  By the way, if you don\u2019t have designs on fame and fortune, a small voice will work just fine in a choir, or just singing for fun. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember, back in the 90s, a \u201cdivas\u201d episode of Oprah that had Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Amy Grant in their prime\u2026 primes? Anyway, Oprah went down the line asking each singer about herself. When she got to Grant, Amy said something along the lines of not really feeling like she belonged in that group since, as she put it, she had \u201conly about an octave range.\u201d If you\u2019re talking about just casual, around-the-house singing, I would say any range would be fine, but you\u2019re severly limited in repertoire if you can\u2019t exceed an octave. If you\u2019re talking about an actual performance range, I would say not less than an octave plus a fourth (e.g., from C4-F5); and even an octave plus a fifth would almost double the repertoire you could cover.
