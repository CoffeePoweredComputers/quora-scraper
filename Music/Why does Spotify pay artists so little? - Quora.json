            "answer_text": "Spotify pays poor royalties because that's what they were able to negotiate with the labels.  Sorry about the soapbox, but this is unfortunately the labels doing.  IMHO, if the labels embraced an easy subscription or cheap purchasing model around the time of Napster, it would not have ingrained into the culture the forgiving attitude towards stealing music.  That attitude was born in the late 90s and early 2000s because of the complete lack of a legal downloading service.  As consumers sometimes do, they turned to illegals means, like Napster, Kazaa, and Gnutella. This is also (partially) the reason why Spotify isn't making a lot of money.  There are still several services like BitTorrent where it's very low friction to download nearly any song or album you want for free.  Asking people to pay is essentially just an appeal to ethics.  Unfortunately, many choose free stuff over ethics.   I don't mean to put myself on a pedestal here.  I pay for Spotify Premium because I like the mobile service, I believe artists should be compensated for their music, but most of all, I don't want to get caught and sued. ",
