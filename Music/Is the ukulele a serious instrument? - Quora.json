            "answer_text": "Heh. My opinion of the ukulele has definitely changed over the years. I used to think of it as a children\u2019s toy, used for teaching music. \u201cMy Dog Has Fleas\u2026.\u201d (That\u2019s the four-note song I learned for remembering the tuning for the ukulele. I never learned uke, but I remembered the song the moment I heard someone else use it to tune their uke.) Playing the ukulele was something that cartoon characters did as a gag, usually wearing a grass skirt and a lei. And then there was Tiny Tim. Nowadays, with its rise in popularity as a highly portable stringed instrument, it is clear that the ukulele is just as \u201cserious\u201d an instrument as the guitar. Some very talented people are playing ukulele as their only instrument \u2014 look at America\u2019s Got Talent winner, Grace VanderWaal. In addition, a fellow I know, a highly accomplished pianist who can probably play just about anything on a keyboard as soon as he hears it, switched to ukulele as his primary instrument a couple of years ago (and can now play just about anything he hears on his uke). His reason, as he told me, was that it was far more portable than a piano \u2014 but I can\u2019t imagine he would\u2019ve switched if he didn\u2019t think it was a viable instrument for his prodigious talent. And finally, I leave you with this. It doesn\u2019t get much more serious than this:  ",

            "answer_text": "It is true that there are not as many famous ukulele players that really make it big. Only a few are constantly seen in the media, like Dodie, Jake Shimabukuro, or Tyler Joseph. However, the ukulele can be serious if you make it that way. If it's something you fiddle with and don't dedicate yourself to, then it will never be serious. The same goes for every instrument. With the guitar for example, there are many big names because basically every musician knows how to at least play a few chords on the guitar. The thing is, the guitar players don't get to their level either unless they put in dedication. Unless they put in work. So yes, the ukulele is a serious instrument if you are willing to make it serious. ",
