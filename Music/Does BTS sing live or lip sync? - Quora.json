            "answer_text": "From what I have seen, they always sing live. Sometimes, the groups focus on the choreography and lip sync the lyrics. The other times, they sing and either do an easy dance or no dance at all. BTS dances and sings at the same time. The member who is singing would go easy for the dance and the others do the hard choreography. Members with more stamina like Jungkook, Jimin and J-Hope sing very well and at the same time rock the choreography. P.S Taehyung has a skin condition. His skin becomes itchy if his body gets overly hot. So, at some instances you might think he doesn't give his 100% but he tries to do his best for the fans and sometimes goes hard on himself despite his skin problem. RM, Jin and Suga weren't very good at dancing but that was years ago. Now, they have improved their dancing and stability while singing/rapping live. I hope it helps\u2661 Stay safe! ",

It\u2019s evident but us fans just laugh at it. If you are a troll though, you don\u2019t have the right to troll them too. Sorry. ",
