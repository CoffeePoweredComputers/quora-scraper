            "answer_text": "My answer might surprise some but there are a few reasons. In the majority of all cases I prefer the beat or tune of a song more than the lyrics. If I made a preference chart it would be like 60% beat, 30% voice, 10% lyrics. To me, meaningful lyrics are a bonus but not a requirement. (When they are really good, it can be a real bonus though).Honestly, the thing I love most about Kpop is not even the music, but the visuals and concepts. I will usually prefer a high quality video over a high quality song, but the great thing about K-pop is I don\u2019t have to choose :) I watch K-pop videos for the experience, usually not just to listen to the song. To further emphasis the importance of a visual to me, when K-pop music videos DO have English subtitles (which many do), I almost always turn them off (the first time I watch the mv). Because I don\u2019t want them to distract from my experience of the visual. However, I won\u2019t put too much emphasis on this part of my answer because the majority of my playlists are still Kpop regardless of the fact I\u2019m not watching the video along with it.To me the main fun of music is dancing. K-pop songs have great beats and rhythm. Almost every major k-pop song has a specific choreography organized for it, and so every song has a considerable amount of dance-ability. The same can\u2019t be said for most popular American songs on the radio. If they are dancey they are considerably slower and low energy. Not that much fun to dance to. K-pop songs are always energetic no matter what (title tracks at least) and they are CONSISTENTLY good. I feel like the difficult thing about American music is nothing is consistent, it\u2019s hard to find stuff with real energy.However, I do find there to be many hip hop/ rap-esque songs in America which have this energy and dance-ability, so they can be fun to dance to, but listening to them all the time can be a drag because the lyrics usually have horrible messages. Most of the girl rappers I love: City Girls, Cardi B, Saweetie, all they rap about is f*cking dudes and taking their money. Gets real tiring after a while. But I love their energy so I continue to listen. On the other hand, I could listen to K-pop where I have no idea what they\u2019re saying, and don\u2019t have to worry about that. Just move along with the beat, maybe sing along to the chorus, but you rarely ever hear demeaning messages in K-pop.If I do find a K-pop song I really love, I almost ALWAYS look up the lyrics eventually (after I\u2019ve already experienced my first impression of the visual of course). And\u2026 pretty much always the lyrics are amazing. Plus you gain a sense of satisfaction because you got to kind of \u201cfigure out the song\u201d by looking at the lyrics. Like matching it up to see if your impression of the song was correct. Listening to Kpop can be a guessing game sometimes, and never without a rewarding end.We may not be able to speak Korean, but some of us may be interested to learn. I\u2019ve always had a love for learning languages, and I used to look for songs in Spanish, French, and Chinese when I was studying those languages. Even though I don\u2019t have the same interest in learning Korean, it\u2019s fun to become more familiar with vocab and phrases. When I recently watched Stray Kids\u2019 video for Side Effects, I got excited at the part when he said \u201cmy head hurts\u201d because I instantly understood the Korean, even though I wasn\u2019t familiar with all the words. It can be interesting to see how much you know and become familiar with over time. Again, sense of satisfaction.Over all, I\u2019d say my inability to speak Korean has had no effect on my love for Kpop, and if anything, it\u2019s an added interest. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it isn\u2019t necessarily about lyrics. I am a big music lover and I listen to a lot of different languages. Music can have a really nice sound which makes you like it. If you really want to know the lyrics you can always search translation, but most of the time you can guess the meaning by the style. you can\u2019t deny you didn\u2019t listen to despacito because everyone did, and I can assure not everyone speaks spanish or understands it. music is a language itself and you can understand music without understanding the lyrics. This might sound like some cheap poem you can find on a led-light sign but it is pretty accurate to me. kpop and korean music in general is very different from american music. Besides the different sound of just the music there are also the MVs and the choreos. For me a big part to get into kpop was a dance video that caught my eye on instagram, this later turned out to be a cover of EXO\u2019s overdose. Because of all the catchy dances you might even spend some time learning yourself a fun choreo. I would love to understand korean lyrics like I understand english lyrics, but I just can\u2019t for now. But listening to korean songs helps a lot when you want to learn korean, some words keep on returning and then I search the meaning. Next time I hear them I will understand it, that way in the end you might even end up learning a new language. If these advantages come with listening to foreign music I could better ask why you wouldn\u2019t listen to it. and let\u2019s be honest once you are in the kpop fandom why the hell would you want to leave. You have: amazing songs with lots of variety in stylebeautiful choreos and fun dance practicesstunning visualslots of crackheads and laughsamazing fandoms where you can meet a lot of great people with the same kind of music tasteoverall just listening to kpop will be hard, you will almost automatically become part of a fandom and start stanning other groups. Listening to kpop is like a lifestyle and I absolutely love it \ud83d\udc9c ",
