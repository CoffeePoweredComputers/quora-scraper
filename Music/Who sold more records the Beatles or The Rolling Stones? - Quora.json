            "answer_text": "The Beatles outsold every single group and person who have produced music and records in the history of recording!!! All told, the Beatles have sold 1.6 BILLION singles in the United States, and 177 million albums. The number of Beatles singles to reach Number 1 on the \"Billboard Hot 100\" is 21, the most of any band. \u201cIt\u2019s still difficult to fathom just how many records The Beatles have moved over the years. For example, the band\u2019s White Album (24 million) sold more copies than the entire Jimmy Hendrix discography. That brings us to the comparison with the Rolling Stones, the Fab Four\u2019s supposed \u201crivals\u201d in the 1960s. If you go by record sales, the Stones boast only a fraction of the Beatles\u2019 numbers. In fact, if you add the Stones\u2019 figures to the output of the massive-selling Led Zeppelin, they still come up short. The Rolling Stones sold 66.5 million records to Led Zeppelin\u2019s 111.5 million. Which in turn is well short of The Beatles 177 million! The Beatles Rule! ",
