            "answer_text": "Typically, the absence of vibrato is called, straight tone. It was preferred in early music, particularly church music, before 1750 CE. If you have to employ that technique, which you should do sparingly, you would need to slightly lower your soft pallet to prevent your vocal.folds from vibrating a lot. Be sure to continue to breathe deeply from your belly, & be sure to send plenty of air upward, so the sound doesn\u2019t become breathy. If you can avoid using straight tone, please do! It places an unhealthy & unnatural strain on your vocal tract. Only use straight tone if a piece or a director calls for it! ",

            "answer_text": "Straight tone! A lot people think of this as less skilled than vibrato, but to perfect a good, long solid straight tone like this:  You need to make sure you can stabilize your voice so it sounds resolute and not wobbly. A lot of people hide pitch wobble (jitter) and volume wobble (shimmer) behind vibrato, so it\u2019s good to keep that in mind when working in straight tones. There\u2019s some interesting study on jitter and shimmer in elderly populations that we can apply to helping singers avoid any curve balls while working on straight tone (I\u2019m sorry lol).
