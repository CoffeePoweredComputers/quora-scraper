            "answer_text": "The easiest way would be to download a trial of Ableton Live for free. Drop an audio file in, click \u2018Warp\u2019 on the bottom left of the sampler. Select \u2018Complex\u2019 (located 3 sections under the \u2018Warp option). Double-click anywhere on the waveform to create a \u2018Warp Marker\u2019, dragging this marker to the right will slow down you\u2019re sample (by lengthening it), left to increase the speed (by shortening it). Or search on YT for \u2018How to Warp a Sample in Ableton Live\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Because digital audio is just numbers, it is possible to change the speed (stretch or squash) of an audio sample without changing pitch, or to change the pitch without affecting the speed. If you can get your sample onto a computer, you can use a program like Audacity (it's free) to do this kind of manipulation very easily. ",
