The tone of voice where you are certain you\u2019re gonna win poker hand, you know you just won an argument with your significant other or when you just dropped the mic on someone during a debate. Get in the state of mind where you are the strongest, smartest, funniest, sexiest mother lover in the house. Then double it and VOILA! ",

            "answer_text": "Practice, practice, practice. It\u2019s a process finding a \u201crap voice\u201d that\u2019s comfortable. I\u2019ve gone through a lot. In the end, find what\u2019s most comfortable, and find what makes you feel confident. Some people force their rap voices, and if you find a \u201cforced\u201d voice comfortable, then go for it (this might be a bit unpopular). Personally, forcing my voice causes me to strain it, and I can\u2019t rap even three verses without feeling sore if I do. Find your own style. ",
