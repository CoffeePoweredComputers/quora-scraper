I thought it was amazing but it feels like it kinda passed everyone by. I'd say d-crunch is more underrated than e'last. it kinda feels like e'last is gaining some attention due to wonhyuk being president atiny and honestly I love that for them. I became their fan because he was such a huge atiny. stan ateez y'all, like no pressure but they're ready for world domination ",

Here's one of my favourite songs from them (and it was only released 2 weeks ago!) :  Here's one of their choreo videos that I really enjoyed watching. This video is how I found out about them!  Link to their K-profile: ENOi Members Profiles (Updated!) As an ARMY, it's sad to see talented groups like this getting only 40k views on their latest comeback, because I know how BTS started out. I bet that if ENOi was in a bigger company, they would be getting a lot more attention. Please check them out and give them support! :))) ",
