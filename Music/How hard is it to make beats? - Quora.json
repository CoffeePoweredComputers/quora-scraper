            "answer_text": "That's the same question as \"how hard is it to draw?\" Anyone can draw a stick man, but it takes and incredible talent and expertise to draw something an art gallery would happily hang on its walls.  Similarly with the software available these days, just using an iPad and a cheap app you can make a beat in a couple of minutes with no prior knowledge. You can download something with a load of pre made samples and piece them together into a beat, and probably with no knowledge of music or prior experience you could do it in a few minutes.  To make something original, musical, catchy and that makes it to become a hit record you probably need a lot more skills. Knowledge of music theory so you can put chords together. Knowledge of sampling to get good drum/percussion sounds. Knowledge of synthesis to make great synthetic sounds. Knowledge of audio processing to mix it and make it sonically what it needs to be. And you probably need some fairly expensive equipment and software.  Any one of these areas is a life time of learning, and even massively successful beat makers would probably tell you they are still learning. To make basic stuff using other people sounds is really easy these days. To make something that's your own, grooves, has character and sounds pleasing, well that's the culmination of a life's work.

            "answer_text": "First and foremost, I urge you to COMPLETELY DISREGARD Charlie Beeson's answer to your question. As sad as it is, it can also be comical at times when an individual is SO CONFIDENT in their opinion, as if it were a scientifically proven fact simply because they say so. But\u2026 as the saying goes \u201cIGNORANCE IS BLISS\" and it must be because frankly, it is PAINFULLY obvious he has ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what he is talking about. That being said, I'd like to offer my opinion, it is NOT fact, it is not the only answer or point of view on the subject, its just the opinion of someone who has been making hiphop music for over 20yrs. Now, the real question you want to be asking yourself is, \u201cDo I just want to make beats?.. Or \u201cDo I want to produce some awesome fuckin music?\u201d True, anyone can bang on a table, or make a few noises with their mouth, or push a few buttons and call it a beat. But if you want to make great beats, there is SOOO much more to know. Furthermore, if you want to be a great producer, not just a beat-maker, then there is even more to learn, in fact, you will never stop learning, as is so with any artist and is craft. If it were as easy as Charlie Beeson makes it seem, then there wouldnt be schools that just teach Music Production, and colleges wouldnt offer it in their curriculum. Now there are some free music making apps & software out there, i dont know what kind of device you have but i would start their if money is tight. But the best thing you can do for yourself is to start studying \u201cMusic Theory\" because despite Charlie's expertise (or clear lack thereof) there is absolutely a science behind making great music. If this is something u really want to do, learning Music Theory will open up so many doors for you, i promise you. Just dont give up, dont get overwhelmed because, as with everything else, practice makes perfect & good things come to those who go after it\u2026 good luck to u, God bless -D.
