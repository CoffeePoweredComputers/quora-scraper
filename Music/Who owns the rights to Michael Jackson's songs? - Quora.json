            "answer_text": "In 1985 Michael Jackson acquired the ATV Catalog with more than one million copyrights including 250 Beatles songs, for $40 million after being advised by Paul McCartney to invest in the business of music publishing with includes all the rights of songs and their lyrics. The catalog was considered the jewel of the music industry and created a lot of controversy and friction between Jackson and SONY. The Catalog featured the Beatles songs, songs by Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and many Black artists to whom Jackson reverted ownership gifting those Black artists back their rights which were never owned by the artists themselves but owned by the studios. Jackson thought it a travesty that most of the studios owned the music made by Black artists who never had an opportunity to own their own musical genius. The Jackson family has never received any of the royalties from Michael Jackson\u2019s music. The Jackson Five was part of Motown Music. The only Jacksons who receive money from Michael Jackson\u2019s Estate or from any of his music are his mother and his children. The Estate holds MIJAC and all of his unreleased music. His brothers and family do not benefit and have never benefited from his musical holdings or his Estate except for Katherine Jackson, his mother and then his children through a Trust. SONY now owns the entire catalog. Jackson spent a great deal of his money and his life trying to make it fair for artists in the music industry. His fight with SONY was legendary as was his business savvy in owning the catalog. He was a successful Black businessman which did not sit well with the racist and wealthy elite in the music industry. It is not widely known that many Black artists died poor and disenfranchised from their own music and that Jackson championed their cause in an ongoing fight with SONY. In 1995 Jackson sold half of the ATV catalog to SONY for $100 million creating the SONY/ATV joint Venture. As a stakeholder he had a voice in music publishing. His catalog was priceless because he was the first and only Black person to own music. He often predicted he would be killed for his catalog. In the contract SONY had the option of initiating a buy-sell provision in its joint-venture with Jackson in which either party could purchase the other\u2019s half. Jackson died in 2009 and SONY exercised their option in 2016 with no warning informing the Jackson Estate of intent to buy or sell its half. John Branca and John McClain settled with SONY owning all of the SONY/ATV catalog paying the Estate some $733 million. The deal for SONY simplified it complex music-publishing holdings. With the Estate no longer a partner of SONY/ATV, the Estate had a separate deal for the EMI Music Publishing catalog which they bought for $2.2 billion in 2012 with a group of investors including the sovereign wealth fund Mubadala of Abu Dhabi. By controlling both the Sony/ATV and EMI catalogs, Sony has wielded the biggest catalog in the music-publishing business, with annual sales of just under $600 million, according to Sony filings. The Estate declared that they sold SONY the catalog to enhance Michael Jackson\u2019s children\u2019s inheritance after SONY exercised its option to buy. Jackson fought to keep his catalog all his life and would have never sold it to SONY while he was alive. His contentious relationship with SONY and Tommy Mottola was protracted, public, and well documented. He suspected and announced to friends that he thought SONY was behind the allegations of child abuse during his lifetime. His family holds similar suspicions, He tried to right the wrongs of the music industry during his lifetime and there are people who still believe he died trying. ",

            "answer_text": "To which rights are you referring? There are several types of rights vested in a copyrighted work. Publishing, performance, recording, reproduction, or synchronization? Publishing rights restrict who can generate copies of the actual words & music in written form, e.g., sheet music and song books. Performance rights restrict who can perform the song in public before an audience. (However, the permission of the rights holder is not always required - there is such a thing as a Compulsory license - I pay a flat fee & there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop me from performing your previously published song in public. Also, generally speaking, singing \u201cDo You Wanna Be Donna Summer? I Want To Be Donna Summer\u201d at Grandma\u2019s birthday party at home for friends and family seldom triggers a legal action.) Recording rights restrict who can make a recording of a performance of a song. (Again - see Compulsory license) Reproduction rights restrict who can make and distribute copies of a recording of a performance of a song. These rights are usually vested in the record label, and compulsory licensing may apply in some instances, but not all. (Example - compilation CDs with many different hits by many different artists.) Synchronization rights restrict the use of copyrighted sound recordings in films, commercials, and television shows, and are somewhat tied in with the reproduction and performance rights. There is no single answer to this question, as the answers are determined by contracts between parties, which we the public are not privy to. The best answer I can give is that the bulk of the most desirable rights (publishing, performance) to his most popular works (post-Thriller) are owned and controlled by his estate. Rights to the actual sound recordings (for reproduction and/or synchronization) are normally vested with the record label, however, given MJ\u2019s superstar status giving him the upper hand in a record label deal, it is very likely he retained some rights to the sound recordings. Otherwise, it depends on the composition, and when he wrote it. Much of the rights to his earlier work that was written and recorded prior to him becoming a global superstar and having the balance of power and the upper hand in a record deal are owned by Steeltown Records, Motown Records, Epic/CBS Records, and RCA Victor, depending on the project. Further, last I\u2019d heard, the rights to the master recordings of 2000\u2019s Invincible were still the subject of a dispute with Sony Music Entertainment. What you might find interesting is how many rights to OTHER PEOPLE\u2019S works that Michael Jackson owned. Back in 1980, when MJ collaborated with Paul McCartney on \u201cSay, Say, Say,\u201d he learned from Paul that McCartney was making approximately $40 million a year royalty income off of owning the rights to other people's songs. By 1983, MJ had begun investing in purchasing the publishing rights to songs that others had written. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \"Everyday People\" (1968), Len Barry's \"1-2-3\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \"The Wanderer\" (1961) and \"Runaround Sue\" (1961). Jackson's most significant purchase came in 1985, when he acquired the publishing rights to ATV Music Publishing, which had acquired the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including the Northern Songs catalog that contained the majority of the Lennon\u2013McCartney compositions recorded by the Beatles.
