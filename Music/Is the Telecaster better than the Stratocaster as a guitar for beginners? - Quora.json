            "answer_text": "Aside from any personal preference, the strat is conceived as the more comfortable to play out of the two. This is welcomed for a beginner guitarist. Also, the strat offers more diversity in tone. Again, a welcomed factor for any guitarist, especially a beginner; when your first starting, a guitar that can do a lot of genres will support your growth as a guitarist. Another benefit to the strat is the ability to \u201cmod\u201d the instrument. While the telecaster does have after market support, it is undeniably not comparable to that of the strat. This again encourages growth in ones playing, as just about all of the features on the Stratocaster have modding options. To conclude, if you are unable to test out both models, you can bet that the strat is more likely to be your guitar of choice, however, you really have to play the guitars to make such a decision. While most people say the Tele is for a niche style of playing, it may be your preferred guitar. Anyways, when it comes down to which models you should take a look at, if you are on a heavily restrictive budget, the squire bullet guitars are impressive across both models. If you are not and can spend some more money, check out the classic vibe series. And if your pockets allow for it, the player series (the made in Mexico Fenders [the entry level for getting FENDER on the headstock]) is incredible. -James ",

Both seem to have their own plusses for early learners, some of which can also be dependent on one\u2019s age/hand size. Contoured body. I\u2019ve taught more than few young players that expressly did not like the squared-off edge of the Telecaster, and not just because of chaffing while strumming, but rather when the forearm was at rest. Unless playing/practicing while standing, the Stratocaster is often more comfortable for smaller/younger learners of guitar. A no-nonsense bridge. Be the classic 3-saddle brass or 6-saddle modern, a Tele\u2019s hardtail bridge is one less physical piece to worry about, although once a Strat\u2019s vibrato is well set up (or altogether screwed down), it becomes less of an issue. But\u2026does versatility of having a vibrato and extra pickups matter to an early learner? I\u2019m not sure that I can say yes.Traditional ashtray = Potential ouch. A tender young right hand can have issues when resting it anywhere close to the sharp edge of a traditional Telecaster bridgeplate (L). Strats and Moderns Teles (R) do not have this issue. No doubt there are additional factors to think about beyond comfort, [1]but for an early learner on one\u2019s first guitar, bridge/saddle comfort should not be entirely ignored. Position of controls. Not an absolute for everyone, but the location of the volume pot in particular can be a little obtrusive on a Strat, especially for early learners that may not have proper right hand position down pat.Neck size. Be it a pencil neck 1968-spec Strat or meaty soft-V 1950s Tele neck, there are loads of extremes[2], and an early learner would greatly benefit from getting advice from one\u2019s instructor and/or trying one out for himself/herself.Footnotes[1] 6 Best Telecaster Bridge For Your Fender Guitar 2019[2] FRETBOARD.COM -- Fender Neck Myths Debunked",
