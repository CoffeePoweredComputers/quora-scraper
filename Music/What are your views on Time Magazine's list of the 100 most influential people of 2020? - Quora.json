That said, if they want to prop up sexual predators, drug money launderers, and violent criminals who rob pregnant women at gun point, as positive role models and influencers, again, that is their Constitutional Right. My right is I can spend that 10 dollars on something else. ",

It used to be a staple on my list of must reads, but it has become less and less relevant with the break up of Time-Life and the rise of the internet. I have not seen a list and I am inclined to think it is like the magazine, largely irrelevant. ",
