            "answer_text": "Who are the best singers of all time? That's a tough question to ask. The list includes many of the greatest vocalists ever, from all genres of music. Whether it's the incomparable, late, great Whitney Houston with her extraordinary pop and R&B tones or rock icons like Freddie Mercury from Queen, Jim Morrison from The Doors or John Lennon and/or Paul McCartney from The Beatles. Though I haven\u2019t listened much any of them except the Beatles. So, As a kid of 21st (twenty-first) century , here are my Favourite Singers . These are maybe the greatest singers of all time specially of this generation. ARIANA GRANDE  She has one of the most impressive ranges of any female singer in the pop music industry, and she makes it all look So Easy.What\u2019s also interesting is her ability to switch from her softly vocalised mid-range to that characteristically \u2018Ariana\u2019-style belt \u2013 a mix of chest and head voice. She became the most followed woman on Instagram. Forbes ranked her amongst the highest-paid celebrities in 2019, and Time named Grande as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016 and 2019. Billboard recognized her as the \"Woman of the Year\" in 2018.My personal favourite. JUSTIN BIEBER  Justin Bieber is a Superstar. Rather you like him or you don't , the youngster that started out and came to the United States is one of the biggest Pop stars in the Business. He has broke 17 Guinness World Records. He enjoys the strongest fanbase in the world. CELINE DION  THE QUEEN. C\u00e9line Marie Claudette Dion is a Canadian vocalist. She is the best-selling Canadian artist and one of the best-selling artists of all time with record sales of over 250 million copies worldwide. Dion has won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Probably her most well-known recording is My Heart Will Go On, the theme song from Titanic. ENRIQUE IGLESIAS  He has been conferred the title of \u201cKing of Latin Pop\u201d. This eminent pop singer has sold over a 100 million records worldwide. He also had ten #1 songs on Billboard\u2019 Dance charts, making him the only male artist to achieve the feat. In the late 90s he made a crossover into the English language music market. BEYONCE  She has an awesome voice and a lot of her songs are great to listen to with the tune being very catching. In addition to being one of the best entertainers of all-time, Beyonce is a wonderful dancer. She has by definition great stage presence, the ability to command the attention of an audience by the impressiveness of one's manner or appearance. That is the meaning of stage presence, and that's what Beyonce has a lot of. Queen Bey fits her, and like it or not, she is a true diva in every sense of the word. MICHAEL JACKSON  This legend needs no introduction. He was a master singer, dancer and performer. He was also a prolific songwriter, as well as a music video expert. He was a mega humanitarian (if I can use the word \u201cmega\u201d). He was the greatest entertainer to ever live, as well as the greatest artist. He was arguably the most talented artist ever, but he also worked really hard and was disciplined perfectionist. #King of pop LADY GAGA  Some like her, some hate her. But, the fact is Lady Gaga is here to reign the music world. Known for her off-track music and her controversies, this stylish singer has broken all barriers between pop singers and their audiences. This is what makes her so popular. AKON  He is the first solo artist to hold both the number one and two spots simultaneously on the Billboard Hot 100 charts twice. Akon has had four songs certified as 3\u00d7 platinum, three songs certified as 2\u00d7 platinum, more than ten songs certified as 1\u00d7 platinum and more than ten songs certified as gold in digital sales. Akon has sung songs in other languages including Tamil, Hindi, and Spanish. He was listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the #1 selling artist for master ringtones in the world. RIHANNA  Having sold over 250 million records, Rihanna is one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has earned 14 number-one singles and 31 top-ten singles in the US, and 30 top-ten entries in the UK. Her accolades include nine Grammy Awards, 13 American Music Awards, 12 Billboard Music Awards, and six Guinness World Records. Forbes ranked her among the top ten highest-paid celebrities in 2012 and 2014, and Time named her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world twice (2012 and 2018). Alongside a successful music career, Rihanna is well known for her involvement in humanitarian causes. BRITNEY SPEARS  Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award; the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; the GLAAD Media Award's Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. THESE WERE MY FAVOURITE TOP 10 SINGERS. TELL ME IF I MISSED SOMEONE. Though I am listing some other singers below because they are also best in their kind. Taylor Swift Adele - Soulful Eminem - yet another legend. Katy Perry Selena Gomez Madonna Ed Sheeran Pitbull Sia- Hands down to this unique voice. Shakira Bruno Mars Camilla Cabello Charlie Puth Ellie Goulding - Legend Calvin Harris Selena Gomez Shawn Mendes One Direction Chester Bennington - True Icon Miley Cyrus Luis Fonsi Coldplay   ",

            "answer_text": "this is going to sound like a very teenage answer but hear me out. its gerard way. yknow. the my chemical romance guy. i was listening to the billy joel channel (the siriusxm one that they only have in the fall) with my dad and one of the segments where billy answers a question came up, and the question was similar: \u201cwhat is the greatest band of all time?\u201d billy didnt say my chemical romance (lol) he said the beatles. His reason? the beatles were the best possible people to work together creatively. as in, paul mccartney was not the best singer that ever lived, but he was the best singer for the beatles. and what i extrapolated from that is, it doesnt really matter what your technical talent is with music as long as it works with what every one else is doing. this brings me back to my original point: gerard way. in the words of tumblr user galvanists, \u201ci love.. gerard\u2019s voice\u2026 so fucking much\u2026 he\u2019s so good, and it\u2019s so unique, it\u2019s like nothing i\u2019ve ever heard before. he can just do so much with it, from snarling and growling to fucking crooning, he belts and he screams and he fucking serenades, and he blows me the fuck away, he\u2019s the best singer i\u2019ve ever heard and maybe he\u2019s like not perfect in a technical sense, but he brings so much power and emotion into his words and anyway yeah yeah we get it you love gerard way you would die for him you think he\u2019s one of the best musical artists of the 21st century\u201d gerard was the best possible voice for what my chemical romance were trying to say!! on their third album, the well known black parade, the fucking pain in his voice dude. when hes singing about not having any hope during the track cancer, asking someone to call his aunt to pack up his stuff because hes going to fucking die, i legit cried the first time i listened to the song. lol. unrelated but twenty one pilots cover of the song is one of the worst songs in the entire history of songwriting. it makes me want to cry, but out of pain for my ears. anyway. the melancholic story told in 3/5 my chem albums perfectly showcases why gerard is so good. combined with ray toro (the guitar god)\u2019s amazing guitar skills, frank iero\u2019s rhythm guitar to add flare to the song, mikey way\u2019s basslines, and the violent but purposeful drums, it makes a damn good song. in the other two albums, gerard highlights the grit of his voice, delivering the performance of someone who wants to demolish the fucking government (or, at the very least, is very frustrated about having to conform and wants to touch upon his punk roots in a fun concept album) not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but i dig it. and once again, the music is also fitting to the voice. over the decade or so my chem was around, with every album both the voice and the music evolved, but always stayed compatible and good as hell. so. tldr. gerard way is not the best singer in a technical sense, but the way his voice cooperates with the elements of the music around it, make it one of the best.
