The song \u201cSorrow\u201d was on their 2011 cd release High Violet.  Sorrow found me when I was young Sorrow waited, sorrow won Sorrow, they put me on the pill It's in my honey, it's in my milk Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water Cover me in rag and bone and sympathy 'Cause I don't want to get over you I don't want to get over you Sorrow's my body on the waves Sorrow's the girl inside my cake I live in a city sorrow built It's in my honey it's in my milk Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water Cover me in rag and bone and sympathy 'Cause I don't want to get over you I don't want to get over you Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water Cover me in rag and bone and sympathy 'Cause I don't want to get over you I don't want to get over you ",
