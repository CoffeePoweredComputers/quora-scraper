            "answer_text": "Yes of course. The Accordion is NOT a mouth instrument. It is a KEYBOARD, but it is played Sideways. You normally see them in POKA music. But nowadays lots of Musicians use them for the sound. On my Electric Keyboard, Yamaha , plays 64 DIFFERENT SOUNDS. ACCORDION is one of them. I love the sound. When you are singing, You use your BREATH , your TONE, your PITCH, for your voice. If you can sing along with the Accordion and sing at the time you are playing sideways on the keys, on concentrate on both the song and your playing, then you have mastered both. It is easy, but it takes CONCENTRATION. Playing a Guitar is much easier, Playing Piano, is much easier. Because your eyes and. brain are looking LEVEL at the Keys on a Piano, ( Electric Piano). and a Guitar, ( The Strings). When you are looking at an Accordion , your eyes and your brain are focusing on seeing it from another DIRECTION. SIDEWAYS. So you to TRAIN YOUR EYES TO LOOK THAT DIRECTION, AS well as your BRAIN. It is NOT A NORMAL PROCESS. Usually Most Musical Instruments are UPRIGHT. DRUMS, PIANO, KEYBOARDS, CELLO, ECT. So the Accordion is almost Upside down.. Unlike playing a GUITAR that is alwasy Sideways. You almost FLIP OVER THE ACCORDION, Full Circle. So it makes it rather difficult to play and keep the Beat. But as I said, You can sing and play, if just takes CONCENTRATION. Have you noticed a DRUMMER , when he plays, like Ringo,. Ray Cooper, all the good Drummers. They are doing FOUR TIMES ALL AT THE SAME TIME. Their feet are moving different, One is on the BASS PEDAL. One is moving faster than the other one. One hand is keeping a STEADY BEAT, while the other is moving at a DIFFERENT BEAT. It takes a LOT OF CONCENTRATION TO BE A GOOD DRUMMER. I dated a Drummer way back when, and he showed me HOW TO DRUM. OMG. IT IS HARD. I could not do it, My hands kept going at the same time., Not Different Beats. I could not keep up. it was very Different Now when I watch the GOOD DRUMMERS, LIKE RINGO STARR, and others who keep a STEADY BEAT AT ALL TIMES, I am AMAZED. Because I know how hard that it to do. So it almost like that. You have to Keep your beat on the Accordion and watch your hands( Sideways) and SING. and stay on the Count of the song. So it does require some Technique. I am not I could do it. I play Keyboards, but not SIDEWAYS. That is a DIFFERENT STORY. So I hope I answered your question. The answer is YES. But it not EASY.

            "answer_text": "Yes. It\u2019s possible to play any instrument that isn\u2019t brass or woodwind and play at the same time. Accordion is one of the easier ones since the instrument doesn\u2019t generally sit by your throat. I play violin and sing and I have to hold my violin differently to do it. But yes, there are so many accordion singers that I know personally. If you know the accordion and know how to sing then there\u2019s not much stopping you. The accordions baby brother the concertina might be a nicer and easier place to start though if you\u2019re considering learning. ",
