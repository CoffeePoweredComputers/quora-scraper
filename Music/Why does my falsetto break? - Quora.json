            "answer_text": "Maybe your falsetto breaks because you are not using proper breathing techniques. Maybe you are not properly able to visualize the note in falsetto when you try to hit it. You probably need to do more vocal exercises focusing on how to get into falsetto without your voice cracking. Try not to push up when and think up when you sing falsetto. Think down and let it freely flow. I hope this helps. ",
