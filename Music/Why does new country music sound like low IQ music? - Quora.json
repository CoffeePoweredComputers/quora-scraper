            "answer_text": "I believe with the exception of some of the music in the 1960/70s and a few alternative music in the 1990\u2032s, most most top 40 music content is well as you put requires a low IQ to understand. Most top 40 music in Pop and rock and R&B from the 1980s on especially , have approached us at the most primaly level. The two most talked about subjects sex, and enjoyment of drugs, oh and violence. Not for a deeper understanding, but a celebration of these topics\u2026 Now, I do say most there are many exceptions but they are less marketable\u2026 Now I only say this, because people that think modern country is worse now than before it was before think it for two completely different reasons: One a abject notion that people that live in rural areas are backward and incapable of deeper thought\u2026 Or they grew up listen to Johnny Cash, Willie Neslon, Waylon Jennings, Mere Haggard, and the like and long for the introspection, in your face, and with deep lyrics and now despise it sounding more and more ie dumb. Along these lines modern country is no more than pop with a southern draw. Of course it could be mentioned that the southern draw it self is a reason, but that would of hurt the afford mentioned artists as well. Say many things about Jonny Cash him having a low IQ is not one of them. The point is that the music industry is a huge business and it knows how to appeal to the masses. Most artits once signing a contract do not have creative control, so until the masses want deeper lyrics it won't be top 40 music. Nor does it has to, who wants to think deep thought all the time, music is meant to also be uplifting, danceable, and fun. Nor does top 40 radio rule any longer, more traditional country is still out there, on the internet, and elsewhere just not as marketable, here are a couple links: Big Smith, below Redheaded Stepchild.

            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question, and I Think I may have the real answer. As music is subjective and Humans vary, coupled with the inner experience music provides us with, it's really all about how we react emotionally to different sounds. I personally feel frustrated and annoyed when I\u2019m exposed to country music. To me, the sound is silly and should be something on the childrens\u2019 music network. But that\u2019s nothing to do with the lyrics. (Well, not always). My inner experience is that the sound of the country and western music, singing style and often times clothing and dancing offends my intelligence. That\u2019s just my personal and emotional reaction. To go a bit further, I\u2019d need to understand \u201cwhy\u201d that is. If I think about it, it\u2019s just a sound, look and culture that I don\u2019t like. I do not relate to it. Same with a southern accent. I can\u2019t help it. It just hits an inpatient and intolerant switch in my brain. I can\u2019t make myself like something that I truthfully can\u2019t stand. That\u2019s basically why I don\u2019t eat rhubarb\u2026 Why do I love classical music? I can\u2019t tell you WHY my body gets goosebumps, and my imagination lights up like fireworks in the night sky while listening to a violin or a piano. I can\u2019t tell you WHY I feel my energy and soul expanding inside me so powerfully, that the only way it can go beyond me is by tears, or with a creative writing piece that will bleed out the intense emotions and inspirations. It\u2019s just what resonates with me. I understand it, and it\u2019s a part of my soul. Perhaps what\u2019s really going on is magnetic. Attraction and repulsion, and each of us resonates our own compatibility. Mar. ",
