            "answer_text": "The problem with this question is the fact that there were so many different 60\u2019s sounds . That was part of the appeal of the period , the desire to experiment with different styles , to break boundaries, while celebrating the past , taping into you local culture , while being open to the whole wide world . Some of today\u2019s bands sometimes forget to try that , and end up trying to sound like themselves , with a signature sound that they lose that pioneer spirit that made the 60\u2019s so exciting . I would rather bands tried to apprehend that spirit than copied the sound . I know that doesn\u2019t answer the question ! ",
