            "answer_text": "There aren't any free courses outside of YouTube. Here are two things I can do for you. One: you can go to this website right here: Tara Simon Studios | Vocal Coaching & Music Lessons. This woman knows more than I was aware of and can prove it with physical demonstrations of what she's explaining. I know that all the choices there are on her website to learn to sing better if not well will definitely be worth it. Two: I can give you a sequence of vocal techniques to learn on YouTube that are best to follow in the order I name them. And here it is: breath support, mouth space, removing/singing without tension, removing/singing without strain, singing on pitch, vocal compression, resonance, chest voice, head voice, falsetto, mixed voice, belting, vibrato, and singing with emotion. I suggest learning these different techniques from your choice of only one of these YouTube vocal coaches (doesn't have to be the same person each time): Tara Simon Studios, Madeleine Harvey, Adam Mishan, Justin Stoney, and Verbs Vocal Technique. It may not be what you asked for, but I hope it helps. ",
