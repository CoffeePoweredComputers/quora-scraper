            "answer_text": "Different people approach this subject differently, but personally to do so I was taught to shed the weight gradually as I ascend from my lower to middle (and ultimately, higher) register while still staying in my modal voice. This can be done by having a good breath support as well as using vowel modifications - for the latter, instead of using vowels that are too wide and forcing the sound when ascending, I shade them to a more narrow position (for e.g. I will modify \u2018aaahh\u2019 more towards \u2018uhhh\u2019, and so on and so forth). Slightly narrower vowels not only help you to maintain depth and warmth in your sound, but they also prevent your larynx from shooting up and jamming your throat as you are singing in your middle voice (assuming that you are a guy who is a baritone, it will be around A3-Eb4, although depending on your voice classification the location will be different). As an enthusiastic intermediate, I am absolutely not perfect at this yet, but doing this has helped to expand my range by about 5 semitones higher than I previously could several years ago. You can refer to the following chart when you are trying to access that middle voice during your vocalizing and singing routines:  ",
