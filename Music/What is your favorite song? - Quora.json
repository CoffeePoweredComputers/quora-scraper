            "answer_text": "This week? These will be songs from the last 5 decades that I have always found a way to come back to. A lot of music when released seems fresh, satisfies you temporarily. These are songs I keep going back to. \u201cLiberation and Poem 58\u2033 - Chicago Transit Authority (Chicago\u2019s first album) Terry Kath was a monster guitar player. The whole band was tight. \u201cBlue Sky\u201d- The Allman Brothers Doesn\u2019t get any better than Dickey and Duane \u201cMarque Moon\u201d- Television or Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd \u201cIt Must Be Love\u201d- Rickie Lee Jones One of my generations great voices \u201cRunaway\u201d - Aurora, Norwegian singer/songwriter. Her first album \u201cAll My Demons Greeting Me As A Friend\u201d is just a year or so old and it turned my ears on like nothing else in the past 10 years or more. \u201cHey Sheriff\u201d - The Backsliders (Live from Raleigh NC version) One of the best bar bands in America ca. 1992\u201395 \u201cCortez the Killer, Like A Hurricane, Down By The River\u201d - Neil Young, OK , I can listen to Neil sing and play just about any time, any song. But the long guitar solos are my favorites \u201cEuropa\u201d- Santana \u201cLive\u201d version off \u201cMoonflower\u201d LP How long can you hold a note Carlos ? \u201cSoukora\u201d- Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder This song is just my fave from an entire album of faves. The Album \u201cTalking Timbuktu\u201d was my introduction into the African music scene. There\u2019s a lot of great music coming from that continent. Great guitar players like King Suny Ade \u2026.Djelimady Tounkara \u2026.., Franco (real name) Fran\u00e7ois Luambo Makiadi,\u2026.. Diblo Dibala \u2026.. just a wealth of great talent there. \u201cBye and Bye I\u2019m Goin\u2019 To See the King\u201d- Blind Willie Johnson , called by many the \u201cGreatest Blues slide guitar player EVER\u201d. Not an exaggeration \u201cTracks Of My Tears\u201d - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles- Everything Smokey Robinson does is worth listening to. \u201cEveryday People\u201d - Sly And The Family Stone \u201cWE got to live together\u201d Yes we do. I remember a time When music brought Black and White Americans together. \u201cGirl Of Mine\u201d - Blue Rodeo, Tells the story of a man\u2019s crushing heart the most accurately I\u2019ve ever heard it. \u201cToo much to bear, too much I fall down drunk, too much I care\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u201c \u201cDiamond Mine\u201d is one of my favorite albums \u201cRego Park Blues\u201d-Ronnie Earl and The Broadcasters/with Bruce Katz 15 minutes of Blues magic. Guitar, B3, Who am I kidding. Every Ronnie Earl song is a favorite. Ronnie is a legend for a reason. \u201cWhy Modern Radio Is A-OK By Me\u201d - Roman Candle, every word of this song rings true. \u201cBroke Down\u201d, and \u201cFlowered Dresses\u201d - Slaid Cleaves. \u201cFlowered Dresses\u201d is written by Karen Poston but he does a perfect job on this poignant love song of unfulfilled dreams that rings so true. \u201cIf I Could Olny fly\u201d - Blaze Foley. Legendary Austin Singer/Songwriter. Called \u201cThe Duct Tape Messiah\u201d for his habit of wearing duct tape covered suits. Died too young trying to stop another man from taking a beating. \u201cNo greater love for his fellow man, than he who would lay down his life \u2026..\u201d \u201cPenny Black\u201d - Bob Delevante , How much do I hope you forgive me darling? Enough to send a letter with the rarest stamp in the world attached. adly overlooked American Songwriter \u201cMediterranean Sundance\u201d - Paco DeLucia, AL Dimeola, John McLaughlin 3 of the best guitarists in the world just playing with each other. \u201cDon\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over\u201d - Crowded House, perfect song from a perfect album \u201cWalking Into The Sun\u201d- Driftwood. Kind of Bluegrass/Folk band with a Rock n Roll attitude from Binghampton NY. \u201cChoctaw Bingo\u201d James McMurtry Let\u2019s go for a WILD ride to Uncle Slayton\u2019s house for a family reunion. \u201cGhost Repeater\u201d - Jeffrey Foucault- Songwriter\u2019s songwriter \u201cDoctor My Eyes, \u201cFor A Dancer\u201d The Pretender\u201d - Jackson Browne \u201cHeroin\u201d - Lou Reed (Rock n Roll Animal version) Rock music doesn\u2019t get any scarier than this 24 Hours At A Time\u201d - Marshall Tucker Band , Oh just let me hear anything that Toy Caldwell is playing guitar on. I could go on all night. I haven\u2019t even touched Jazz or Classical or Bluegrass ",
