            "answer_text": "The first and foremost and the only thing popped in my head is: your breathing technique is incorrect. What's wrong with my breathing technique?You are most likely not breathe from your diaphragm, but rather use chest. Chest breathing is small in capacity and shallow, making you run out of breath easily, but we often do it unconsciously. On the other hand, diaphragm breathing is large in capacity and deep, so you can hold breath much longer, although you need consciousness and self-reflection to teach your body to do it irrespective of your mind. Diaphragm breathing is all we need for a good, supported, sustained tone in singing, and it also prevents you from singing from throat (which is damaging to vocal cord). How do I know that I breath correctly, i.e. from diaphragm and not from chest?If you breath through your chest, your chest will slightly expand to forward and sides, and your shoulder will rise. If you breath through your diaphragm, your abdomen (belly) will expand to forward and sides, and if I'm not wrong, your back will lean forward, too. Your upper stomach will felt hard, as if you're preparing yourself from incoming punch to your stomach. Another trick is to lie on your bed and put books or whatever things on your stomach, and see its movement as you breath. If you breath from diaphragm correctly, the books will go up a bit. Either way, make sure your shoulder and chest steady; you want the sensation coming only from stomach and back. How to increase my breathing power and capacity?Basically, aerobic exercises. Try jogging, sprinting, biking, swimming, hiking, and other natural aerobic exercises (I dislike fitness anyway). But if you find fitness could be useful too, then it's good. They say Pilates is a good one. Do you have any experience?I'm actually just a newbie, but in the past I struggle from E4 and above. Basically I can sing it but the tones are strained and my vocal cord felt tired only after 5-10 seconds of sustaining those notes. Since my Quora friend hear my voice and suggest correct breathing, I never strained F4, G4, G#4, and even A4-B4 anymore, and those notes are sung with full and supported tone, too. From good breathing comes good tones, good vocal cord health, and even better development to your singing (without good breathing I can never hit that beautiful 440 Hz A4 without shifting to falsetto). I hope I could be a help. Good luck and keep singing! ",

            "answer_text": "I guess you are a lower male voice. Then D4 could be the note where you have a register change, often called in italian term passaggio. If you only sing with your chest voice mechanism that you use when speaking, you have difficulty to go higher than that.  It is natural, because that's the voice we use in everyday life, and to expand your range you should use your voice in another way that may not be familiar.  You will be able to go higher when you learn how to use the head voice mechanism. First mix that to your chest voice near the register change, and later on sing higher notes using the head voice. The passaggio technique and blending the registers is usually the main challenge for beginning male singers.  This can't be really taught writing online, especially if you don't find your head voice at all (and based on the description it sounds like that). I could give tips, but there is always the possibility for misunderstanding or misinterpreting in written instruction.  A professional voice teacher can help you discover this, give you exercise to work it on your own, and help you to extend your range in a healthy way. You will develop faster if you get voice lessons. You can also try to fnd some teaching material to get grasp of the idea. ",
