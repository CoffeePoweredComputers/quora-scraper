            "answer_text": "My sons girlfriend came to my house after she just got back from a festival in Amsterdam. Her lips were so chapped and sore looking, it was painful to look at! I didn't have any lip balm made up because my daughter takes a new one every day. She must be selling them on eBay. Just kidding. Anyway, I scooped some shea butter into a little tin and told her to use it. A couple of days later my son told me that she said it was the best lip balm she's ever used and won't ever use anything else again. Obviously I told her that it was raw shea butter and not an actual product. Try it yourself. Get the unrefined stuff. I buy 5kg for \u00a335. It is amazing for feet and hands too, just direct straight out of the tub. Here's a recipe for a nice light body butter you can make easily yourself. It will spread easily and soak in quickly. 70% Shea Butter 30% Oil. You can use Sweet Almond Oil/Macadamia Nut Oil/ Grapeseed Oil which are nice light oils. Or you can go for something heavier like hemp or even olive oil. Sunflower oil is nice too. In a double boiler melt your shea and oil together. Stir and refrigerate. As it starts to set up after 30mins or so whisk it with an electric whisk. I use a hand held one. Pop back in the fridge and whisk again at regular intervals. Once it is fully cooled you can whisk it until it is double in size and looks like souffl\u00e9. Tip. For a less greasy feeling you can a little cornstarch or arrowroot starch during the mixing stages. It really makes a difference. Go with 1tsp per 200g to see how you like the skin feel. You can add more later if you like. I know you asked just about lip balm but you may as well order a kilo of shea and get all the love benefits it has to offer. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Style Caster and dermatologist Leslie Baumann, MD, \u201cLip balms with humectants such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin make lips worse \u2026 these ingredients pull moisture out of the skin, especially in a dry environment, and then the water evaporates away.\u201d But before you throw away everything with a humectant, Baumann goes on to say that as long as the product has occlusive ingredients like shea butter, beeswax, and some oils, you\u2019ll be fine. Those ingredients help hold water, so the two things can work together. The Best Lip Balms Tatcha Camellia Gold Spun Lip Balm Are you bougie enough to wear gold flecked lip balm? Duh. Allure awarded this brand with a Best of Beauty stamp for 2017 thanks to its high content of vitamins, fatty acids (amazing for your lips), and hydration powers. Aquaphor Lip Repair Healing Ointment It can be used for eczema, which proves it\u2019s perfect for calming down the dry, chapped, and cracked lips that have come to be our go-to accessory this winter. It isn\u2019t fancy, tinted, it comes in a cute tube\u2014which makes it super legit in our book, and NY Mag\u2019s, apparently, too. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s great for sensitive skin. Smith\u2019s Rosebud Salve Tinted, minty, and used by our favorite weirdos, the Olsen twins, Smith\u2019s Rosebud Salve is amazing because it can be used ANYWHERE your face is chapped. It also has a super slight tint\u2014perfect for rubbing into lips and cheeks for a nice, subtle glow. NY Mag, HuffPost, and Total Beauty can\u2019t all be wrong. Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm Allure loves it, The Fashion Spot loves it, HuffPost loves it, so you should, too. With a combo of shea butter, vitamin E, AND sunscreen, you definitely need to start using this lip balm. It goes on a super smooth, and actually heals your lips as opposed to just coating them in weird chemicals. Fresh Sugar Lip Hydrating Balm This tinted and slightly shiny balm is listed on several sites including The Fashion Spot, Style Caster, and BeautyEditor as a great chapped lip treatment. It does contain several of the no-no ingredients like fragrances and perfumes, but the high percentage of natural oils derived from apricot, grapeseed, and black currant helps to moisturize even the crustiest lips. Vaseline Sometimes you just need something simple that will get the job done. Even if you\u2019re not using the ~fancy~ new Vaseline lip tins that come in varieties like Aloe and Cocoa Butter, this product has been with you since day one. Probably literally\u2014I bet you still have that 10 gallon tub of Vaseline you bought in 2008. Vaseline is the ultimate ride or die, and it\u2019s good for your lips, too. ",
