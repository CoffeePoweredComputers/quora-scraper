            "answer_text": "I'm going to do something kind of unorthodox here and name five songs from only one band. School of Fish was a GREAT alternative rock band in the early 90\u2019s, and they are tragically underrated. They recorded two albums, a self titled debut, and their second album \u201cHuman Cannonball\u201d. Both are great, but I probably like their debut a little better. They do have a few louder rocker type songs, but you said laid back. Their music, to me, is very unique, beautiful, melancholy, wistful even, at times. Their incredibly talented singer, Josh Clayton-Felt, tragically passed away in 2000 after a battle with an aggressive cancer. He had a very unique voice, and the music lives on. Here\u2019s my five picks for \u201claid back.\u201d Keep in mind, laid back could also be sad too. Ha. Let me know what you think. Take care.
