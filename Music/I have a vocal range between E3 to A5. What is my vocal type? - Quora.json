But asking for vocal type/voice type from this information is a bit like asking: I\u2019m 5\u201910 - what is my mental character? ",

I think a voice teacher might have to verify me on that but I also think many other things should come in to play in what makes someone a certain voice type. It\u2019s not just range, it\u2019s also tessitura, tonal quality, and a few other things. ",
