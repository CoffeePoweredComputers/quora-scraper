            "answer_text": "First: \u201cfeaturing\u201d is a marketing device in the music business. So you feature an artist with a different (but often overlapping) target audience and hope to increase your fan range that way. If it is done well, it is a win for both artists \u2013 even without getting paid. Other than that, it depends on how deeply the featured artist is involved. If she co-wrote the song, she will get license fees from every broadcast, concert or download. If the featured artist merely acts as a performer, he will usually get paid for each performance (plus extra fees for broadcasted performances) like a regular band musician. It is totally possible to arrange other deals and pay a featured artist for the opportunity to have his fans listen to your music. In that case you could think of the featured artist as a widely viewed TV series and you buy an advertisement spot for your music on it ;). Or it is the other way round: the featured artist actually pays the featuring artist to have his name exposed to a new fan base. There are no rules for these kinds of deals \u2013 it\u2019s a negotiation thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Most are Works-Made-For-Hire by copyright law just like session Musicans as they are considered a feature along side the primary artist opposed to belonging to the group as a joint works that would equally own the Masters together. They\u2019re generally paid a one time lum sum as a feature. Now there are different types of deals points esp when a legal binding agreement is involve as I have one that gives the featuring Artist an opportunity to get a share of the Publishing if they contributed as the Co-Writer of the song but they don't own the Masters. They can also get a percentage of Neighboring Rights royalties too such as SoundExchange as a performing featuring vocalist. ",
