Without hearing an example it's difficult to say for sure, so I will have to assume some things. Stop fiddling with a quantized sequencer. Get out of your technical head. Set everything up and go relax, take a walk, have dinner. Watch a sit-com. Something, but not engineer-geek stuff. Then go back to your instrument(s) but don't touch them. Get in touch with your emotion, don't think, feel. Get a riff in your head, imagine it. Remember it. Then another possibly related or a derivative of the first idea. Make it feel like something. Something emotional. Hum it. Whistle it. Learn it. Feel it. Now pick up your instrument (ok, not if it's a piano), and play that idea. Feel it. Repeat it and vary it. Get in touch with the musician in you. Don't think, feel the sound. Keep playing it and playing with variations. No rules allowed! When you find something that really moves you, you can't help playing it again and again. Enjoy it. Practise it. Love it! Now, and only now, hit record and keep feeling the groove, play with the feeling, like your life is at stake. Don't get technical, don't worry about making a mistake. Have fun. Recall that feeling you had with every note you sound. When exhausted, stop. Now take off that touchy-feely musician hat, put on your producer and engineer hat, and make MINOR tweaks as needed, but don't touch the feeling of the riff. It might take a few tries, a few weeks even. Or more. But your goal is to think the feeling, Then turn it into sound. I bet that will eventually not sound like a geometry lesson. It just might sound beautiful to someone. \u2014\u2014\u2014 So after hearing your example, ask yourself, \u201cWhat was that buzz for? Why were those notes placed there?\u201d Every sound should carry the emotional message. Is it to build tension? Raise expectation? Relax after an intense moment? Lighten the mood? Calm? Each sound should support the message of the others. If not, you have a collection of car parts. With the right matching parts, it could be a Ferrari (or whatever you like). Some great ideas might be fine, but might not fit a particular song. John Bonham's drum solo may be awe-inspiring, but maybe less so in a national anthem or church hymn or Frank Sinatra's NYNY tune. Use discretion. Stay on point in a song (unless it's a song about schizophrenia\u2026rules can be broken.) The sound types used, the notes, the timing, rhythm, and harmony choices must all match the emotional idea. I.E. Don't use rapid 32nd notes for a lullabye. ",

            "answer_text": "This reminds me of a quote by the American composer Charles Ives. His piano sonata contains a  note. During an interview he was asked something along these lines. \u201cOf course no-one could play a 1/1024th note, but what would it sound like if you could?\u201d Ives replied \u201cSound? What's sound got to do with it?\u201d He was pretty successful as an insurance executive, so maybe he knew something we don't. Of course he did have the advantage that he didn't have to earn his living as a composer. ",
