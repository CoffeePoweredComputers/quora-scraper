            "answer_text": "I'm not sure where you're coming from, but it's true that bassists are usually not given much importance by the general listener. For instance, a lot of rock band memes make fun of bassists. How they're unimportant, how they're easily replaceable, how anyone can play bass, and so on. The idea by and large is that bassists are the least popular members of a band, and the memes are derivatives of that idea.  It's not much of a stretch, then, to imagine that a bassist is a guitarist who couldn't find a spot, and therefore had to play bass since no one worth their salt wants to be a bassist anyway. I'm guessing that's the reason you're asking this question at all. Whatever the reason may be, you're very far from the truth. I've been a vocalist in college rock bands, so amateur at best, but I'm sure professionals will agree with me when I say that a good bassist forms the foundation of any good rock band. Behind every successful band, there's a kick-ass bassist \u2014 often literally, as they're usually seen minding their own business in the background, typically near the drummer. Let's take the example of a semi-professional, rather noobish band called Rush. I mean, they're only one of the biggest influences for all major rock bands for the last 3 decades, no biggie. Rush had three members. Vocals+bass, guitar, drums. Or let's look at Black Sabbath, the founders of heavy metal as we know it: four members \u2014 bass, vocals, guitar and drums. Or Led Zeppelin, of whose greatness I may not speak: four members \u2014 bass, vocals, guitar, drums. You\u2019ll find bands without a dedicated lead / rhythm guitarist. Name one rock band, or any band which relies on groove, for that matter, that does not have a bassist, and I'll eat three mosquitoes. Dead or alive. It's for a reason: bass guitarists are probably the most important members in a band. For a vocalist, there's literally no band member more important than a bassist. Bass sets the scale and the beat at the same time. Without bass, the drums can't \u201ctalk to\u201d the guitarist and the vocalist. The bass serves as a vital link between melody and groove. It is what forms the foundation of any song, and until the bass kicks in, you'll never have fun listening to one. The importance of bass in a band cannot be overstated. In fact, there seems to be scientific evidence pointing to what I'm saying. Science Suggests Bassists Are Among the Most Important Band Members Bass is, all said and done, easier to pick than a guitar. It may be an easy way into a band for a slacker who wants to be a musician. The bassist=frustrated guitarist equation might hold true in some cases. However, becoming an expert at bass is a different ball game. I think an expert bassist, like Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, is as skilled as the lead guitarist of that band, and significantly more important. Heck, Flea (RHCP) pretty much IS the band. Their contribution to a song is a lot more fundamental than that of guitarists, which makes them harder to appreciate, but trust me, a lone bassist can make you groove to his tune. A guitarist can't do that by himself. Band members make fun of basissts because while they don't get any attention from the typical listener, they know just how important they are. They're the nerds of a band, writing the code in the background, while the vocalist and the guitarist are the sales and marketing people, screaming at you to listen to them and like what they're giving you. You (not you in particular, but the general listener) don't notice the code because you're not trained to appreciate it. Likewise, you've never been within 500 meters of a jam session. Anyone who's practiced with a band can tell you how empty and directionless things sound without bass. If the lead guitarist is Neymar Jr., the bassist is Xavi. Just going to leave you with this video. Listen to the intro and judge for yourself \u2014 does that sound like a frustrated guitarist to you?

            "answer_text": "There are basically three kinds of bassists: People playing bass right now because somebody has toPeople who have moved to bass from other instruments, and have found a home therePeople for whom it\u2019s always been bass, even before they started playing.I\u2019ve played in bands with all three types. We can joke about the \u2018frustrated guitarist\u2019, but a lot of bands wouldn\u2019t have happened if someone wasn\u2019t willing to swallow his pride and be the bassist. One of those bands is really quite famous. There are players who started on guitar, or sax, or keyboards, but, when they pick up a bass guitar, are bass players. They may still play keyboards, guitar and so on, but when they play bass, they aren\u2019t playing bass because someone has to. They are making bass their world, and they move the world with it. Sting plays a pretty good guitar, but he helped to redefine bass for a new generation. My wife is a bass player. It\u2019s a personality thing. She can strum on the guitar if she has to. But her world lit up, musically speaking, when she picked up her first bass. She played her first gig two weeks later. I think she must have practised pretty non-stop over those two weeks, but, really, it was always in her. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin said pretty much the same: he had always been interested in bass lines. Bass is not a more limited version of the guitar, it\u2019s a completely different philosophy. That\u2019s why bassists of the frustrated-guitarist type either have to think themselves into another mindset, or else they just aren\u2019t very good. I used to play with a flute player (or flautist, as we like to say) who played bass. He was a fantastic flute player, and also played trombone, vuvuzela, and a number of folk instruments. But, when he played bass, he was really playing flute, but much lower down. It was fluttery like flute, not both solid and swinging like bass. Bass players lock with the drummer. If you realise the bass is competing with the drummer, then either the bass player isn\u2019t a real bass player, or the drummer isn\u2019t a real drummer. A good bass player playing with an inexperienced drummer does everything they can to help the drummer. A good drummer playing with an inexperienced bass player does the same thing. If you want to be the king of the show, buy yourself one of those fully-fangled lead guitars (also available wirelessly). But just remember the advice of Ava Max: \u201ca king can move one square at a time, but a queen is free to move wherever she likes.\u201dAva Max \u2014 Kings and Queens ",
