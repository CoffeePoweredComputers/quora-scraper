            "answer_text": "OP: Are politicians ever honest?  We in Himachal Pradesh have been blessed to have had a succession of honest politicians who had kept the welfare of the people of the state always to the fore. I shall recount of a few of the great sons of the state. During the period when freedom fighters were waging a struggle for Independence from the British under the banner of the Congress in the British ruled India, similar freedom struggle in states ruled by Rajas and Maharajas was being waged under the banner of 'Praja Mandal' movements. Giani Zail Singh, one of our past Presidents, was a product of the 'Praja Mandal' movement. In Himachal Pradesh, the 'Praja Mandal'movement was headed by Pandit Padam Dev. After India attained freedom, state governments were being formed mostly under prominent freedom fighters of the state. When it came to choose the Chief-ministerial candidate for the state, the delegate proposed the name of Pandit Padam Dev. No other candidate was proposed. Pandit Padam Dev stood up and told the delegates : \u201c Sitting among us is Yashwant Singh Parmar, who is a Ph.D from the Lucknow University. I propose that Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar should be our chief minister. It will be good for the progress of the state. Other delegates did not utter anything against this proposal, though many may had been senior to Dr. Y. S. Parmar as freedom fighter, such was the stature of Pandit Padam Dev. Dr. Y. S. Parmar became the first Chief Minister of Himachal. It was under the vision of Dr. Y. S. Parmar that Himachal Pradesh made big strides in the all fields. There is a statue of Dr. Y. S. Parmar on the Ridge Maidan, Shimla, to honour our visionary leader. There is a Shopping Complex on the Ridge Maidan, Shimla named after Pandit Padam Dev to honour him also. Dr. Y. S. Parmar, remained Chief- Minister of the state from 1952- 1956. In 1956, Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory and Dr. Parmar stepped down. He again became Chief Minister of the state on July 1, 1963 and remained Chief- Minister of the state till he stepped down on 28.01. 1977, during the emergency on his refusal to kow-tow to Mr. Sanjay Gandhi. Dr. Parmar was Chief Ministef of the state for almost 17\u201318 years. It was under his Chief-ministership that Himachal Pradesh became a full fledged state. I had joined the Regional Centre for Post Graduate Studies, of Punjab University Chandigarh, at Shimla in December, 1969 and seen Dr. Y. S. Parmar, walk on the Mall, accompanied by only one constable about 10 paces behind. When Dr. Y. S. Parmar was in office, the BJP and its earlier version BJS used to label serious allegations of corruption against Dr. Parmar. Mrs. Indira Gandhi had the chargesheets enquired into, and found no substance of any corruption against Dr. Parmar in these allegations. The only thing that was found to have some truth in it, was that Mrs. Satya Vati Dang, President of the PCC, and a widow, and Dr. Y. S. Parmar, whose wife had died long years ago, were living together without being married. She advised both to get married to put a stop to these allegations, which they did. Thereafter the allegations stopped altogether. On the death of Dr. Y. S. Parmar, his only assets were a small house in Shimla and a sum of about Rs. 3000/ in his bank account. Another of our great Chief Minister whom I admire is Mr. Shanta Kumar of BJP. He is known to be a great administrator and very upright person. Besides being CM of the state twice, he was a minister in the Atal Behari Vajpayee cabinet. I have read in letters to the editor published in the Tribune, of people being plesantly surprised that Mr. Shanta Kumar would que like other ordinary passengers while traveling by air and not throw his weight around and seek special privileges. It is pity that the rule of denying political office to BJP politicians of 75 years or more has deprived Mr. Modi of the administrative acumen of Shri Shanta Kumar, besides many others in other states.
