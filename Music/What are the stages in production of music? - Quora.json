            "answer_text": "While producing a track, things go out the following way : An idea hits you. You try it on your instrument (if you know how to play any) or maybe you write down the melodies on your DAW.You figure out an arrangement in which your track sounds perfect by adding required elements such as other sounds, bass, percussions, and then you decide where should these elements be in the track ie- during the drop? Or is it better for the intro?After everything is in place, you either mix your song on your own or hire a mixing engineer (highly recommend). During the mixdown, your aim is to make the lead instruments stand out in your track by EQing, compressing, etc. and make sure that the other elements don't affect it and neither do they affect each other. Basically, everything should sound clear when focused onto or at least the lead instruments must sound clear even when you're not concentrating on it.Mastering is the final process where you make sure your track stands out commercially in the different audio formats. It basically is giving finishing touches to your track by using multiband compressions, EQing, saturation, etc. appropriately when required.",

            "answer_text": "There are no stages defined in music production. There are different elements are needed to be created which mixes smoothly. After that you need to master your track for better quality of music. So first, you create melodies (Leads, Arps, Basses, Drums, FX, Vocals) and then you master them before bringing out to the public. ",
