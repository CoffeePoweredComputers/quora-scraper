            "answer_text": "Requested I assume you want me to choose a song Freddie Mercury wrote. Mercury was so prolific and so much is just so good it makes for a difficult choice\u2026not really! My favorite hands down is Freddie\u2019s gospel inspired Somebody To Love. Official Studio Version 1976\u2014Mercury, May and Taylor multi-tracked their voices to achieve a large choir effect. My opinion is this is the sweetest version of the song.  Rock Montreal 1981\u2014A fantastic performance filmed in 1981. The performance is top notch, although the band claims they were unhappy with the filming process, being quite annoyed throughout these two concerts. One wouldn\u2019t know with these pros.  Milton Keynes Bowl 1982\u2014My personal favorite! Freddie Brian, John and Roger take us all along on this emotional spiritual plea. This one is packed with gospel, rock, vein-popping fabulous Freddie vocals, exuberant fan participation. If one was searching for a transcendent experience at a rock concert\u2026this was it!  ",
