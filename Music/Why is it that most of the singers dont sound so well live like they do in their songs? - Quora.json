            "answer_text": "When singers perform live many of them use pre-records and lip-sync to the songs to make sure that nothing goes wrong. But their mike is still on so that they can speak or make audience interested. But sometimes when they want the audience to feel the originality they try to sing with records. In this process they improvise a lot at the moment. That is good sometimes because it makes the audience feel more alive.  When they are doing this the singer should practice properly before the show so that he/she won't make any mistakes. If the singers voice is good (always/at the time) he will manage perfectly. But if his voice isn't he would sound different or will make errors during a concert. So, if their voice is not good, how can they sing well in a recording studio?  In a recording studio you get to take infinite amount of takes and retakes. You just need to have the money. I have seen many singers with bad voice which makes them seem like they have a different voice in a song but when they perform live we will get to know their real talent. When you are recording a song, you don't need to sing the full song at a take. You can sing it in parts and edit them later. Sometimes people even change their voices in the editing to make it sound good (I hate these guys). ",

            "answer_text": "Frankly speaking they sound good always.. We feel this coz 1) When they perform live no booster and effects are added. It's just their voice.  2) While recording they can go in for retakes when they make a mistake but that is not possible when they perform live  3) The instruments and scale differs. They also try to give a new feel and tune to the song.  That's why we feel that the don't sound well. :) ",
