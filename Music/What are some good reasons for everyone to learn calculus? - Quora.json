            "answer_text": "Not everyone should learn calculus. In fact, not everyone is capable of learning calculus.  I passed Calculus when I was in college. I just read the book over and over, learned all the little number tricks involved, figured out how to roughly apply those number tricks to word problems, and eked out either a B or C. I'm not going to pretend that it was hard, but it wasn't a walk through the park, either. That was 20 years ago now. It would take a lot of work for me to get back to the point where I could do all of that now. I wouldn't say that I really \"knew\" calculus even then. I was simply able to play a game manipulating numbers (or rather \"expressions\"). Some very intelligent people I know aren't math people. I don't mean that they don't \"like\" math. They're just not good at it. I know a woman who can go seriously deep into Dubliners or craft a paper which makes me marvel a fair bit. I know a guy who can argue into a corner without breaking a sweat and can play lots and lots of musical instruments. Neither of these people can really do much in the way of math. I drove all the way down to Bakersfield to tutor the Joyce fan just so that she could pass a simple math test which would allow her to get her substitute teaching credential. All she needed was basic consumer math and a bit of algebra. She'd already failed the test several times. I was able to get her to pass, but it was a close thing. I'll say it again: she's extremely intelligent, but she's not a mathematician. Just in terms of raw IQ, we have a significant stretch of the population who are incapable of learning calculus, stats, or anything harder than basic algebra. This is why most school districts in the US only mandate that students only learn up to basic algebra or maybe  slightly beyond. Let's put that aside. Pretending that all students were capable of learning calculus, what would they gain from it? A lot of it would be problem solving skills. Calculus is more than the simple manipulations which I accuse it of being, especially when it is applied. Even basic word problems in Calculus classes force you to figure out which trick will get you the right answer. I will admit that I never used the calculus I learned, but it made its impression upon me. Calculus gives you a new version of number sense, as I no longer look at various processes the same way. I think about rates of change when I play space video games, areas under curves when I guesstimate yardage for concrete or when I look at a graph in a meeting. Would I be able to do those things regardless? Sure. But I think I do it differently now.  Everything we learn shapes us somehow. Math in particular makes us better at analyzing, problem solving, and a host of other, similar abilities. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll assume by everyone we mean essentially everyone. There will always be exceptional cases. Go back 500 years and literacy rates appear in the single digits. Even in the \"developed\" nations of the time, literacy was largely limited to the elite. Why? Because it was common knowledge that not everyone needed to know how to read and write and thus it didn't make sense to invest the (limited) energy and resources necessary to train them to do so. Moreover, it was largely suspected that the commoner couldn't be made literate. The Protestant Reformation, with its emphasis on personal reading and study of scripture, helped to spark a literacy revolution in Europe. Nonetheless, only 50 years ago the global illiteracy rate was double what it is today at nearly 40%. Now we're in the midst of a similar debate about Calculus (or more generally, advanced mathematical training). Does it make sense to invest our (limited) energy and resources in training the general population to understand Calculus? Is it even possible? Is It Worth It?As the printing press transformed civilization half a millennium ago, we're now facing a (much more) rapid transformation of society. Computer and Information Science, Engineering, Economics, and the Natural Sciences all make (increasingly) heavy use of the Calculus. But, perhaps more importantly, automation is replacing many menial jobs and there is an increasing demand for complex problem solving and analytic skills. Calculus (and higher mathematics in general) is a training ground to teach these skills that can then transfer to other areas of one's life. This helps explain why General Electric's CEO Jeff Immelt recently stated, \"I use my math major every day \u2014 I don't use the MBA quite as much.\" But careers aside, Calculus is by all measures one of humanity's most impressive intellectual accomplishments. Just as everyone should have an opportunity to see great art, hear great music, and have some comprehension of our modern understanding of the universe (note well, Calculus will be useful here), so everyone should have the opportunity to reflect on the central ideas of Calculus. Not just for utilitarian reasons, but also because there is something deeply beautiful about it. We can accomplish this without demanding full proficiency in every technique of differentiation or integration, just as one can walk through an art gallery and appreciate the great paintings without fully understanding the techniques behind every brush stroke--granted, there is an added bonus from an appreciation for the details. Is It Possible?I teach Calculus. In doing so, I often come up against the sentiment that some people are \"math people\" and some people are not. Many have come to believe that they are not, and in particular, that they are incapable of learning Calculus. What I find so bizarre about this belief is how widespread it is and how casually it is tolerated, if not promoted, while at the same time we shudder at the thought of a society where people are taught that the majority of them were just not born to be literate. Every semester of teaching Calculus, I'm intentional to dispel this myth. In fact, I have it listed as one of the learning goals for my course. Carol Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford, has done some fascinating research showing that individuals are not born with a fixed intelligence level, rather intelligence can be developed. She's also shown that when students are exposed to this research, it helps them reassess how they interpret failure. If you think you are either a \"math person\" or not, then failing a math exam will signal to you that you must not be a math person, and so you give up. However, if you believe that intelligence is something that is developed, then failing a math exam will signal to you that you need to persevere (and perhaps do things a little differently) before you can master the material. Very recently another team of researchers studied the brains of mathematicians and how they solve complex mathematical problems. They discovered that mathematical thinking activates different regions of the brain than other complex thinking tasks. However, we also know that advanced mathematics activates the same regions of the brain used in basic arithmetic. That is, in some deep sense, we're all wired to learn and think about complex mathematics. It may sound trite, but again and again I've seen this work in my Calculus students. In one instance, I had a student taking my multivariable calculus class who did poorly on both of the midterms. I saw that it discouraged her--she began to check out during lectures. So I talked with her. I told her about the research and helped her reinterpret what she had seen as failure as opportunities for further growth. It reinvigorated her. In the final weeks of the course, she fully invested. She was engaged in class and was the first to appear at all of my office hours. Then the final exam came. It wasn't an easy test. She scored 100%. At the end of the semester she shared, \"This class changed my life.\" I don't think it is just because she then understood Stokes' Theorem. Rather, it changed her view of herself--she knew she was capable of something she had previously given up on. I suspect one of the chief reasons everyone should learn Calculus is precisely because so many people believe they can't. Let's prove them wrong. Let's show them that they're capable of far more than they believe. Who knows what may result. ",
