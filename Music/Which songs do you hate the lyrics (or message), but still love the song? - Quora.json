            "answer_text": "This song was big, huge, the gorilla, the song that invented the term \u201cgorilla\u201d in reference to music hits. There were hits and popular songs, but when it came out, this was a phenomenon:  Rock and roll by its nature invokes raunch and rebellion. It\u2019s supposed to be subversive and naughty and the answer to \u201cWhat will we do on Saturday night?\u201d After all, you can\u2019t think of sex and drugs without adding rock and roll. The Knack came out of nowhere, and faster than you can say \u201cstate fair headliner,\u201d they were gone. But they left behind an imprint that touched on every tenet of a good rock song: lust, longing, and sweet release. Propelled by that signature bass line alternating octaves and Doug Fieger\u2019s leer translated into a howl of teen anguish, \u201cMy Sharona\u201d demanded to know what every teenage boy with blue balls wanted to know: \u201cWhen are we doing it?\u201d This isn\u2019t new to rock songs. This question had been asked in more subtle or clever ways in order to avoid angering the authorities-that-be. The fact that it begins by asking when the sex can start (\u201cOoh my little pretty one, pretty one/When you gonna give me some time Sharona?\u201d) isn\u2019t the issue. The imagery of having a dirty mind and running it \u201cdown the length of my thigh, Sharona\u201d doesn\u2019t cause any problems. But here I am, a grown-ass adult with kids of my own, and I can\u2019t sing along with a great song from my youth when it gets to: \u201cI always get it up for the touch of the younger kind.\u201d Buzz. Killed. This didn\u2019t bother me when I was younger; remember, rock and roll is for rebels. I wasn\u2019t taking the lyrics to heart back then any more than I was paying attention to my parents when they told me to pick up my clothes off the floor. I mean, \u201cthe younger kind\u201d was just a younger version of me. A senior likes a sophomore? How scandalous! Alas, a mature adult can\u2019t abide a message like that. And the guilty pleasure of a rollicking song with a great beat is too guilty if you take it too seriously. Nowadays, if I hear the song come on at Trader Joe\u2019s, I bop my head and pretend I\u2019m playing bass, and I stop enjoying myself when the chorus gets to: \u201cNever gonna stop giving up/Such a dirty mind.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I've got a few favorite songs about how the world, or some aspect of it, is going downhill fast. I'm actually optimistic about the direction the world is heading (aside from climate change and the US moving toward a dictatorship). The most ironic example is \u201cThe Sound of Muzak\u201d by Porcupine Tree. Released around 2002, it's about how music has lost its heart, it's just written by insincere millionaires looking to become billionaires, and it no longer has any meaningful content. It's a message I would have wholeheartedly embraced in the eighties (personal opinion, don't hate me), but by 2002 music was moving in a whole new direction. No thanks to the music industry and top forty radio, which were as bad as ever, but because independent artists and tiny labels could afford to produce their own music without worrying whether or not it was going to be a huge money-making hit. This very song is a prime example of what was finally going right on the music scene. I manage to enjoy the message of the song by imagining traveling back in time to the eighties and playing it then. ",
