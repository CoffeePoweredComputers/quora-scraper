            "answer_text": "Yes with all the careless mistakes in the past I started to hate myself I taught myself to hurt myself whenever I'd make a mistake, I'd nag myself, curse myself and even I would physically harm myself. I always cared how other people felt and to be honest never once I cared about my own. But now I realize that hating yourself isn't just worth it you know. Sometimes I may be hate myself but not like before. Now I'm totally focused on loving myself, the biggest project of my life. Hating yourself isn't just there, it's been taught. You taught yourself how to belittle yourself, pity yourself, look down on yourself ,ignore yourself and mostly hurt yourself. It's something we meditate everyday until you're finally used to it. When you make a mistake people get mad at you, you're like \u201cThey're right I'm this or that. Ida you should have known better..\u201d my voice nags with dripping disappointment. And the cycle continues. If there's anyone who has hated themselves for almost their whole lives, I'm one of them. But now I'm in the road of healing. Now I just focus on the good traits I have and promise myself to work on the bad ones. Once you realize that hating yourself isn't worth it once you'll see a different change in you. You can't make it in this world without loving yourself. Hope I helped. ",

            "answer_text": "My husband made me feel worthless as he always told me I was a failure and he hates me. Therefore, I started believing all of the evil things he said to the point I felt awful. This made me start feeling bad about myself and I did not like myself anymore. I am trying now to rebuild my life and feel positive about myself. My self-esteem is pretty low and it makes me at times hate myself. I realize this is not healthy so I am doing my best to change my thoughts. I realize this will not be easy but that it is important for me to love myself. ",
