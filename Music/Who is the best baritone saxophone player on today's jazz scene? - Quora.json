Put it like this: the Tenor had Michael Brecker (RIP), Alto David Sanborn, and the Baritone has Ronnie Cuber!  Oh, he\u2019s also good on other horns and he also composes and orchestrates too. \u2018nuff said! ",

He\u2019d come into Baker\u2019s Keyboard Lounge on open mic night and just blow the roof of the place. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of seeing him there a few times, and at Bert\u2019s in the market once. Each time he just showed up unannounced and just threw down. ",
