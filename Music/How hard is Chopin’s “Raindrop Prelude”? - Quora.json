            "answer_text": "Out of all the preludes the Raindrop is technically one of the easiest. That being said, it is, like all of Chopin's works, a musically challenging piece. In this particular case, the fact that the melody in the left hand needs to be highlighted in the middle voice means it's not something easily attained for most amateur pianists, and even professional pianists have a hard time negotiating the weight and the voicing each time they perform it. It's the kind of piece that will always sound a little bit different, which is okay but because of the intricacies of the writing itself, it is hard to make it sound consistently acceptable in musical terms. Also, it is very difficult to establish a rubato approach that is congruent with the style of the piece, meaning if it's missing in certain key passages the piece will sound mechanical and stale but if it's overdone the piece sounds weird.

            "answer_text": "Not very. Technically, it\u2019s quite simple. There\u2019s nothing particularly \u201cvirtuoso\u201d about the technique demanded from the performer in the entire piece. It\u2019s all quite simplistic with very repetitive patterns in the left hand. Musically, since the piece isn\u2019t very long and is quite repetitive, there\u2019s not too much challenge here, at least compared to other Chopin pieces, or even sonatas by Mozart (something that most pianists look down on as \u201cbeginner pieces\u201d\u2014 which is complete nonsense). If you can play sonatinas by Clementi or Mozart, you probably could tackle this piece. ",
