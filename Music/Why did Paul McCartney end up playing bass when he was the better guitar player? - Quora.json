            "answer_text": "Paul came to the bass unwillingly. He was, in his words, \u201clumbered\u201d with bass when Stuart Sutcliffe left. George Harrison was on record in the immediate aftermath complaining that Paul's bass playing was rubbish. They had engaged bass player Chas Newby initially, but they quickly fell to a four piece again. George was clearly the most accomplished and technical guitar player, so he wasn't a candidate for bass. John had purchased a quality American instrument, and he wasn't about to surrender his Rickenbacker. By default, Paul became the bass player, and it ended up as a serendipitous choice. Paul's unorthodox instrument choice of a lightweight Hofner was, allied with his uncomfortable and reluctant assignment, representative of his approach. Though Paul was and is a competent and adventurous guitarist, his bass playing initially played it safe. Walking patterns and root-five parts reflected the era's convention and Paul's inexperience. But very quickly, Paul's musicality emerged. He always had superior feel, often pushing with enthusiasm that contributed to the track's excitement. As the complexity and ambition of Beatles music evolved, Paul's bass came to the fore. The acquisition of a Rickenbacker 4001S bass and technical improvements in recording were allied with an explosion in creativity. Rubber Soul saw Paul exploring the bass as a vehicle for melody, and by Sgt. Pepper his bass playing part of the vanguard of a new generation. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, the question states that Paul McCartney was the better guitar player as if its a fact. In my opinion George Harrison was the best guitarist in the Beatles. Paul did play some excellent lead guitar for the Beatles especially durring \u201866-\u201967 when George was concentrating on sitar and his guitar playing suffered. There were times when Paul was the better player for certain songs, but in general George was the lead guitarist for good reason. Certainly in the early years the Rockabilly and Country style leads and licks or the classical acoustic leads that George played could not have been played by Paul. Paul was the bass player because no one else wanted to do it. Thats a good thing because Paul was one of the best bassists of that era. He was innovative and played melodic basslines that influenced generations of players. Before Paul bass was to be felt, not heard. ",
