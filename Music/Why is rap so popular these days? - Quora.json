            "answer_text": "Obvious bait is obvious but f**k it, I\u2019ll bite. Rap is far and away my favourite form of music for a multitude of reasons. Has been ever since I picked up my first rap record in the 90\u2019s and was blown away by the complexities and realness of the lyricism. And that\u2019s what rap is mostly about for me - a complex and very \u201creal\u201d artform, one that was criminally underrated by people in my area for far too long, and is now finally getting the recognition it has long deserved. Honestly, back then I used to feel like one of only a handful of guys screaming about rap from my bedroom, only for most of my praise to fall on deaf ears of those who had made their mind up about \u201cblack music\u201d before giving it a try. Probably due to the well known controversy of NWA and the global, negatively slanted news coverage of the gangster rap movement of the late 80\u2019s/early 90\u2019s. FYI, I\u2019m a middle class white guy who was born and raised in a town called Hull in England, right here on the map:  So, I was far from your typical demographic for hip hop in the 90\u2019s. The days of Spotify and YouTube giving us almost every song at our fingertips instantly were nothing but a pipe dream back then. If you liked a style of music that wasn\u2019t mainstream, you had to really go out of your way to get hold of the records. Especially when it came to underground rap in the 90\u2019s and early 00\u2019s. It was far easier to hear negative news about the music than it was to actually get hold of it, and this held the popularity of the genre down for a long time. Listening to rap back then taught me so much that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise known for a long time. To use a modern day expression, I felt rap made me more \u2018woke\u2019 on some issues than most people I knew. Rappers like Tupac and Biggie were basically \u2018reporters\u2019 of their time, and extremely poetical ones at that. While mainstream news was shoving negatively skewed footage of American \u201choods\u201d down the throats of people worldwide, these guys were telling it how it really is. That gangsters aren\u2019t gangsters because they choose to be, it\u2019s because they have to be. Born into system stripping them of their rights to education, their rights to work and fair pay; authorities flooding the streets with drugs to get people hooked (well documented), the fact that the prison system is made up of majority black people, busted for handling said drugs, so they can be put to work in the modern day equivalent of slave labour camps - all of this news, very culturally important news, was being reported on constantly by rappers and at the same time suppressed by major news outlets, who would rather you believe black people carry guns and shoot each other because that\u2019s just how they are. You might have seen this Netflix documentary getting a lot of praise for \u201cunearthing the real truth\u201d about the US justice system and the criminalisation of African Americans alongside the prison boom:  Yeah\u2026rappers have been exposing that stuff for decades already. And then you get to the lyricism - oh man, the lyricism. Rap offers something you simply cannot get in other forms of music; an A* level comprehension of English and Ebonics, displayed through a complex combination of wordplay, metaphors and multi-syllabic rhymes. It\u2019s diverse too; scathing punchlines, impassioned love songs, club bangers - rap embodies a wide spectrum of tastes and styles. Ask somebody in my area in the 90\u2019s what they thought of hip hop, and they would probably reply with a lame line like, \u201cIt\u2019s a load of rubbish. All they do is swear a lot and rap stuff like \u201cwent to the shop for some bread, shot a man dead\u201d and talk about sex\u201d - basically revealing that they\u2019ve never actually sat down and tried to listen to a decent rap artist do his thing. Ignorance. Pure ignorance. Jay-Z sums up everything I\u2019m saying best in a song called Renegades, where he famously did a duet with Eminem (listen to this song if you haven\u2019t already!). He opens with: \u201cMotherfuckers,Say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling)Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruinedThat same dude you gave nothing, I made something doingWhat I do through and through andI give you the news, with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view\u201d It\u2019s not only a perfect summary of what I\u2019ve said above, it\u2019s also a good example of ignorance. Play that to my grandad, for example, and the only thing he\u2019ll takeaway from that whole segment is the word \u201cmotherfuckers\u201d and will complain about the swearing. He\u2019s never actually LISTENED to the hip hop, to the messages behind it, he\u2019s just SKIMMED THROUGH IT and highlighted the cuss words. Here\u2019s the full song, featuring some of the best verses both Jay-Z and Eminem ever wrote in my opinion:  So, to come back to your question - \u201cWhy is rap so popular when it\u2019s so bad?\u201d - the answer is simply, it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s freakin\u2019 amazing. Thanks to artists like Eminem breaking down barriers and taking the artform global in a bigger way, and the rise of platforms like Spotify and YouTube putting extensive libraries of the music at anybody\u2019s fingertips, millions of people are now looking back through the years of existing rap and realising, \u201cDamn\u2026okay, there\u2019s something to this\u201d An artform that was suppressed and intentionally reported on negatively in the media has finally broken free of those chains, and anybody with a semblance of respect for having a good command of language is now able to appreciate rap and all of its diversity to its fullest extent. It\u2019s no coincidence or marketing ploy that hiphop has grown into the most dominant genre of music in the world right now. Not much has fundamentally changed from those early days. It always deserved to be there at the top of the music pile, and my only advice to you is that you seek out more artists and actually LISTEN to what they have to say. Forget Chance the Rapper if you don\u2019t like him. I\u2019m not keen on him either - just doesn\u2019t speak to me much. Listen to some Onebelo (solo or Binary Star), listen to some Immortal Technique, some Talib Kweli and Black Star, check out Gangstarr, Big Pun, Brother Ali, Locksmith. Take some time to note down what Tupac was really saying. Most of all, listen to how they all use their language to convey their messages in a playful, catchy manner; in a way bringing poetry and the old Jesters style of delivery back to the forefront of entertainment. Everybody has a favourite style of music; that doesn\u2019t mean other styles of music are bad. I never thought much to heavy metal to be honest with you and I still don\u2019t, but after a friend recently explained to me how a good heavy metal group operates (the timing and almost hidden cohesion behind the apparent frenzy of the performances) I sure can appreciate it. You don\u2019t have to like hip hop or any style of music, but to brand it as simply \u201cbad\u201d shows an incredible level of ignorance for a lot of elements of music. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is rap so popular when it's so bad? Not bad as in inappropriate but annoying. Chance the Rapper has the best rap cause it doesn't sound like crap. Like classic rock is the best music ever and I don't know how anyone could disagree. I am 17 and just hate rap. I feel like everyone likes it because they think they are cool for liking it. I\u2019ve addressed this before on Quora, but I\u2019ll pick apart this question in parts. 1, \u201cNot bad as in inappropriate, but annoying.\u201d This, like most things regarding musical taste is extremely subjective. I don\u2019t find a lot of rap annoying, except for the most generic, trashy, basic \u201cradio\u201d rap, and even then, some of that is aesthetically pleasing, even if I\u2019d rather not listen to the lyrics. So this premise is just incorrect; rap may annoy you, but it is not objectively annoying. 2, \u201cChance the Rapper has the best rap because it doesn\u2019t sound like crap.\u201d Again, this is entirely your opinion. Chance is alright, but I\u2019d hardly call him the best, or even in my top ten. There are plenty of rappers who don\u2019t \u201csound like crap,\u201d but if you don\u2019t seek them out, they can be hard to find, depending on what you hear. 3, \u201cLike, classic rock is the best music ever and I don\u2019t know how anyone could disagree.\u201d Okay, now stop and think- there are people out there who would disagree. I know several people who think classic rock is annoying, and it all sounds like crap, except for KISS, because they don\u2019t sound like crap. I also know a ton of people who can\u2019t fathom why someone would hate rap. It\u2019s all about perspective. 4, \u201cI\u2019m 17 and I just hate rap.\u201d I\u2019m not sure why age matters here, but I\u2019m 20 and love it. Eminem is in his forties and loves it. Dr. Dre is hitting on 60 and loves it. I know a lot of people of all ages who love rap. What\u2019s your point here? 5, \u201cI feel like everyone likes it because they think they are cool for liking it.\u201d Maybe some. Not others. I like rap because I like storytelling, I like rhythmically intricate music, and I like flashy wordplay. I listen to artists like Eminem, Tech N9ne, Kendrick Lamar, Krizz Kaliko, Childish Gambino, Tupac, the 213, Tribe Called Quest, Del the Funky Homosapien, Logic, Hollywood Undead, and Canibus. Their music has all three attributes I look for, is well-produced, and relevant to my life, at least somewhat. I grew up listening to Eminem, and there are dozens of his raps that not only flow tighter than a water hose with a pinched off nozzle, they hit you right in the emotions. Stuff like \u201cYou\u2019re Never Over,\u201d \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone,\u201d \u201cMockingbird,\u201d etc. I listen to Tech and Kaliko because they just spit quick, and in Tech\u2019s case, he\u2019s definitely one of the most cerebral rappers out there (only second to Canibus, who is seriously underrated. Dude rhymes medical terminology like he has a double PhD in Neuroscience and Spitting Bars.) From the scathing review of rap stereotypes in \u201cCome Gangsta,\u201d to the heartfelt depiction of grief in \u201cLacrymosa,\u201d to the hurt and anger of \u201cFragile.\u201d Gambino\u2019s a class act and overall unique, and Kendrick is a powerhouse of a rapper- I don\u2019t see how anyone who likes any rap at all could find no Kendrick verse they can empathize with. He\u2019s political as all hell, but he wraps it up in layers of literary complexity. Tupac was a lot like Kendrick in some ways- he was just more direct with his storytelling, and had more hopeful, uplifting messages, to Kendrick\u2019s pessimistic, realist view of society and the hood. Tribe Called Quest and 213 are just straight up classics, and amazing, Logic is good at what he does, Del is a crazy sci-fi writer disguised as a rapper, disguised as an ape-summoning ghost in the Gorillaz\u2019 \u201cClint Eastwood,\u201d and the Undead are a metal band that started rapping. They tell some really good stories too. That\u2019s why I listen to rap. That\u2019s why I like the rap that I like. Why is rap popular when it\u2019s so bad? In the words of one Marshall Bruce Mathers III, \u201cIt\u2019s so good that I\u2019m so bad.\u201d It\u2019s popular because people like it. Why is milk so popular when it tastes like vomit? Why is beer so popular when it\u2019s so bitter and gross? Why are romantic comedies so popular when love is yucky and scary? Why is Ben Afleck so popular when he\u2019s not the best actor in Hollywood? Why is anything popular when one person dislikes it? Really, why? ",
