            "answer_text": "I see a lot of great answers and I believe he had vast influences to his vocal techniques, but I think he took the \u201chee hee\" and \u201chee\"s from Stevie Wonder. If you listen to \u201cMaybe Your Baby\" by Stevie Wonder, released in 1972, I think, you'll hear Stevie pepper the song with the phrase. Other S.W. songs that come to mind are \u201cI Wish\" and \u201cLiving For The City\". The first time I think Michael used a \u201cHee\" variation was on The Jacksons hit \u201cBlame It On The Boogie\u201d, which was on their 1978 album Destiny, well AFTER Stevie had been using it. The Jackson 5 and Stevie Wonder worked together on a few things in the early 1970s and Stevie and Michael weren't just friends, but musical influences both brought up by Motown. So, it's no wonder some of Stevie rubbed off on Michael's vocal techniques, like Diana Ross and James Brown. This is in no way to say Michael \u201cstole\" anything, he definitely borrowed a lot from so many people to make his own styles and trademarks as ALL legendary artists have done. We just attribute the \u201chee hee\" more to Michael (rightly so) because Mike MADE it a trademark, where as Stevie just used it as an exclamation or ad-lib. That's my theory. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it was something he started doing in the Late-1970\u2019s, continuing on through the turn of the Early-1980\u2019s (during his and his brothers\u2019 \u201cDestiny\u201d/\u201cO\ufb00 the Wall\u201d/\u201cTriumph\u201d period). Before then, even on faster-paced songs, Michael would sing the lyrics straight through, pretty much, as they were written. At that time, he didn\u2019t make all these extraneous noises and sounds. Afterwards, when the Jackson brothers recorded their \u201cDestiny\u201d album, was when Michael began making these \u201cexclamations.\u201d You hear them throughout \u201cBlame It On the Boogie,\u201d and other songs from it. Since then, on practically EVERY up-tempo and fast-paced song he would record from that point onwards, he made some form of \u201cexclamation\u201d (such as, \u201cWhoo-Hoo!!!,\u201d \u201cHee-Hee!!!,\u201d and \u201cAoww!!!\u201d) \u2014\u2014 throughout almost every other line/lyric of every other song, very nearly to the point of it eventually becoming an ANNOYING habit of his, for one to constantly keep hearing, at times \u2014\u2014 instead of just singing the lyrics. If there was any \u201cflaw\u201d to his vocals, THIS is the one, in my honest opinion. ",
