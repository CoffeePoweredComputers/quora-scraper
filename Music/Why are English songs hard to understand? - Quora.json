            "answer_text": "If the person is a competent singer, you should be able to understand the lyrics. Diction is a very important part of a singer's technique, and is a mark of how well trained the singer is. However, singing is different from speech-the singer, in order to create a tone that is in tune and pleasant, has to modify the way words are pronounced, and in the case of words sung at very high pitches, that modification can be pretty extreme. Singers do not emphasize consonants to the same degree that they emphasize vowels because in general, consonants close down the vocal tract and vowels open up the tract-and good singing depends on an open vocal tract (air has to be able to flow from the lungs, up the throat through the vocal cords, and out of the mouth). The quality of the tone, as well as pitch accuracy, depend on an open vocal tract. And some consonants, if emphasized or are held out are very unpleasant to listen to, such as \"r\" and \"s\", and if not modified or deemphasized can cause the tone to be off-key, especially at the higher pitches.  So, sometimes in a song, especially one with a lot of pitches outside of the normal speaking range, in order to maintain that openness and tone quality/pitch accuracy, the consonants are deemphasized more than they would be in normal speech, and long/sustained  tones are on the vowel. In English, since it is consonant heavy, that can mean certain words cannot be fully understood , especially those in the highest pitch ranges since high pitches require that the vocal tract be fully open, and that will mean minimal consonant. A well trained singer should not have any issue with diction for the most part.  A badly trained singer will not be able to modify the words in such a way where they can be understood, particularly with pitches that are higher than are in the normal speaking range. If the singer is singing tones that are close to the speaking pitches, then the words should be discernible. But if the singer is singing notes near the top of his/her range, then the words might not be as clear. However, most songs are written so that the singer can sing the lyric and be understood if they are properly trained and are singing songs that are suited for their voice type. If you cannot understand anything the person is singing, it is a sign that they are not well trained. ",

Listening to slow \u201cballads\u201d can be a far better material for English studies.  Moreover,  if you search online for the \u201cSong Title\u201d + Lyrics, you can find  a textual form for the lyrics (words) and study them as you listen to the sound of the song on some recording or a video online. Here is an example. You will notice that the song is sung in a slow rythm: \u201cHigher Than The Wall\u201d By The SteelDrivers There are walls made of paper, and walls made of stone And some that are made out of livin' alone I built a wall no one could break down Locked up my heart where it couldn't be found You saw past my shackles and let love unfold Showed me the truth from the lies I'd been told My heart was a prisoner like no heart at all Till your love reached higher than the wall Higher than the wall a thousand feet tall High above the darkness where the blue shadows fall Your love reached higher, where it's better and brighter Yeah, your love reached higher than the wall Now I'm wearin' freedom instead of those chains Empty reminders don't cause me no pain It's all gone away like the leaves in the fall 'Cause your love reached higher than the wall Higher than the wall a thousand feet tall High above the darkness where the blue shadows fall Your love reached higher, where it's better and brighter Yeah, your love reached higher than the wall Yeah, your love reached higher than the wall Songwriters: MICHAEL JAMES HENDERSON, CHRIS STAPLETON \u00a9 Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., Universal Music Publishing Group For non-commercial use only.
