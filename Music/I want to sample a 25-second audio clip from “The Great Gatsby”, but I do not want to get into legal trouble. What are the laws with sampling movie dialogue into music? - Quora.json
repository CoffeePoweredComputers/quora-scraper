            "answer_text": "U.S. Perspective: Sampling of any audio requires permission. By \u201csampling\u201d, I mean taking an audio or music clip and putting it into your music. So there is no legal way to do this, except by getting permission. Making music pretty much never fits fair use, so you almost certainly won\u2019t be able to make that claim in your defense if you get sued. ",
