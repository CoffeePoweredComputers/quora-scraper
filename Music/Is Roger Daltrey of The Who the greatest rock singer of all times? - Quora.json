            "answer_text": "We all have our own opinions.. He\u2019s one of the greats no doubt. I tended to like the tenors like Steve Perry of Journey and Lou Graham of Foreigner. More song stylists. These days with all the Queen hoopla, Freddie Mercury is going to be high on that list, as he should be. Sir Paul and Mick definitely. Robert Plant and Paul Rodgers (who also toured with Queen). Bowie and Rod. It\u2019s probably one of these guys. Funny thing, on this forum you don\u2019t have a lot of Paul Rodgers fans. When I was a young musician in the mid-Seventies, most of the players I met touring, all thought he had the best set of pipes. And he kept on singing, way into the 2000\u2019s when he toured with Queen. Don\u2019t forget, Prince fans all think he was the best too\u2026 ",
