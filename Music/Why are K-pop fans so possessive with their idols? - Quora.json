            "answer_text": "When I used to think of possessive K-pop fans, an image of a young yandere like teenage fangirl would usually pop up in my mind.  Now that I\u2019ve been in the K-pop community for a while, I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s mostly possessive adults fans who pose the biggest threat and show extremely invasive behavior towards a K-pop idol. But I\u2019ve got to clarify that obviously not every K-pop fan is like this, and most normal fans would condemn this type of behavior. The reason why I point to adults is because most of the creepy fans I\u2019ve unfortunately had to see, had jobs and were being paid regularly. They could actually afford to travel and follow the idols everywhere. Now why do such things occur, and why does it seem more prevalent within K-pop? It\u2019s no secret that many idol companies are trying to sell a fantasy to the fans, they want fans to be obsessed because that brings them money. Many people assume that all possessive fans believe they will date, marry, or befriend the idols, and although some of them do, it\u2019s not the case for everyone. One thing I\u2019ve noticed is that possessive fans usually tend to be the extremely overprotective ones. Many of them are very aware that they don\u2019t have a chance with the idols, so they take out that frustration on the people close to them. Sadly this is why those possessive fans get hostile towards anyone who gets too friendly towards their precious idols. They overstep boundaries and want to control who their idols gets to be friends with, talk to, date, and often project their own insecure feelings onto the idols and their relationships. ",

            "answer_text": "Not all are possessive but there's a very large number of them who are possessive, obsessed, name it all. And i can only think about one thing - the extreme fan service. Let's see what fan service is\u2014Fan service originated from Japan(\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9 fan s\u0101bisu), fanservice, or service cut (\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8 s\u0101bisu katto)is material in a work of fiction or in a fictional series which is intentionally added to please the audience- according to Wikipedia. I mean it's to please the audience right, doesn't seem bad. But then, Kpop has proven to actually market themselves out of the fanservice. They give fanservice like: PLEASE NOTE!!!! NOT ALL THE ONES I'LL MENTION BELOW ARE BAD. IN FACT SOME ARE SO SWEET. Telling their fans that they are their girlfriends/boyfriends and they should not date. Heh, really? You know how Delusional people can be. The moment your favorite idol tells you Never to date even if it's a joke, some people take it seriously because they think they have a chance with these idols. LOL!Wearing revealing outfits etc to please their fans. This is not just in Kpop but in the music industry globally.. Artists give fans snacks during special fan meetings.Some artists get tatoos of their groups and their fandom.Some idols get touchy and cozy with their fans as though they are best of friends.I think fan service is basically more for business promotion because If idols call their fans their \u201cgirlfriends/boyfriends\u201d, their companies can regard the fans as part of the family or their trusted best friend. They can also organize events that appear to be more centered on the groups //solo artist while simultaneously promoting their company. So they benefit a lot. ",
