            "answer_text": "I don't think it's ruining music, but I do think it's changing people's expectations of what is \"good singing\". This also lends itself to the whole DIY singer trying to make it on their own becoming more pervasive, since with a good engineer and some common sense, most people can sound passable in a studio.  If someone trains themselves to become a pop singer using auto-tune, then they will always have a crutch. there will always be a place for people who put the work in, and craft their voice and trade over time, no matter how insane technology's capabilities become.

You must including the dragging of loops into software, using pre-made beats and anything else that amount to artificiality in music. Real music is played by real people on real instruments, because they feel real things deep in their souls and want to express it through music. ",
