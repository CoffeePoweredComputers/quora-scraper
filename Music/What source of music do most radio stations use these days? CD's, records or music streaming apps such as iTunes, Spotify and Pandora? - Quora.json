            "answer_text": "Most stations these days are partially or fully automated, with software designed for the purpose, and using files on a PC or server. These may be lossy or lossless files in a variety of formats. The software loads the next event while the current one is playing so that it can cross-fade tracks. The station may or may not have turntables, CD or cart decks that could be put on air. I suspect many do not; most get music from syndication services as files or discs. Some may also use satellite feeds for part or all of the day. The DJs don\u2019t even have to be there; they can pre-record a week\u2019s worth of patter in a few hours, to be placed appropriately by the software. ",
