            "answer_text": "Most artists tend to put a great deal of thought into the order they place the songs as it can strongly influence how individual songs and the album as a whole is perceived. For example, if a loud upbeat song follows two or three slow, moody ones, then the upbeat song will stand out much more than if it followed a couple of similarly upbeat songs. I first bought an early CD release of \"Your Funeral... My Trial\" by Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds which, unbeknownst to me, had a different running order than the original vinyl release. I love the album and have always considered it quite a violent, aggressive one. Not long ago they released a remastered version which had the original running order restored. This made the album as a whole seem much less aggressive and more pensive, sedate and moody, while still containing exactly the same songs. So the running order clearly contributes to the album in some way. Brian May from Queen once said in an interview that they can spend weeks just trying to work out and decide on the running order for their albums. It's quite common for albums (especially 'rock' - in the broadest sense of the word) to start with one or two fairly full-on numbers, and to end with quite a laid-back quieter track. ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest answer is, usually it is not random. In fact, I have never heard of an album that was sequenced randomly. I remember when music first started getting ripped to digital and people could play songs in random order. This pissed off many musicians who had spent a lot of time getting the song order right and did not want people playing their albums out of order. Seems kind of quaint now. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on the artist and the record label, most labels like to put the \"strongest\" tracks or potential singles in the first 3 positions.  For some reason third position is considered especially important.  I myself prefer to observe this rule/idea (I believe Paul Simon popularized it):  always move up in key throughout the sequence.  If you need to drop, do it with a large interval such as a fifth.  This will keep the energy flowing throughout a complete listen. ",
