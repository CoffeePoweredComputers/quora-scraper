            "answer_text": "Lisa is the most popular because she has a large number of fans in her hometown, Thailand, which she represents as a part of her identity and how she is as a person. Those who admire her for being to achieve her dreams of being an idol despite her ethnicity in the Kpop community that was only accepting towards Koreans and sometimes, Chinese or Japanese trainees, has now made a change, one that would change the standards of Kpop beauty through the course of Kpop history, as there are more people who are not exclusively Korean, Chinese, or Japanese, and how despite these ethnicities, they are still able to follow their dreams and achieve it and be able to be as capable as Kpop idols who are Korean by blood. That is the inspiration that makes her popular, the strength and brilliance to face adversity and emerge as a rising star, to break standards and reinforce new ones to allow more trainees who want to aspiring idols and to also achieve their dreams despite their differences into the Kpop community, which only continues to evolve. She has become someone people looks up to, and no longer someone who was just a trainee once practicing hours upon hours to just be granted of the promise that she would debut. She worked hard to get where she is and in fact is the only one who got accepted through a YG audition, proving that her talents and skill spoke enough about hercpoetila to be an trainee and work their way up their to be the idol that they see fitting in their image they wanted to project to the world and YG knew that she would be the perfect fit for the group that they were forming and would help them bring them to stardom and fame and fame did they get. Without Lisa, Blackpink wouldn\u2019t be where they are right now, and there wouldn't be her intricate and skillful dancing, her unbeatable rapping skills and unique style and her powerful and bold singing that is rap influenced, and her overall intoxicating and intimidating aura that she exudes. Just as much and the other members contribute a big part to the foundation of the group and the budding blocks that have made the group it is today, Lisa has played a big role in helping the group reach this state of fame and success, and this is only just the beginning of their journey to even more unprecedented success and more new achievements and millstones to overcome. She deserves the popularity she is receiving, and I hope she only has all the recognition in the world for her skills in all areas of being an idol. I am glad that she is being recognize more and more for her talents and skills rather than only her ethnicities, which is barely telling of who she truly is. ",

            "answer_text": " I think a part of this reason might be that she\u2019s Thai , believe it or not but we subconsciously prefer someone who looks similar to us or is from a Sam background as ours it makes us feel safe and assured .She\u2019s an amazing dancer with according to me the best stage presence .She has a childlike personality, a lot of idols with carefree , bubbly personalities are liked for example V from BTS I don\u2019t know why that is exactly .Unlike other foreign idols , she\u2019s fluent in Korean , like I said that makes her Korean fans get a bit of securityShe\u2019s beautiful no doubt, although outer appearance doesn\u2019t matter as much as you think but that\u2019s what makes you notice a person if you find out they have a nice personality you decide to stay.She has a lot of photo shoots done and makes sure to post the best pictures along with the funny or makeup free photos on here Instagram , at first look it seems perfect but then you look at the bubbly photos and realise \u201coh she\u2019s a human like me too.\u201dAs the rich get richer the popular get more popular. A lot of fans have additional fan made videos, fan art, fanfictions about her it only makes the amount of people she\u2019s capable to influence greater.Bts is really popular nowadays a lot of these fans (both bts and bp) ship their idols together , so even bts fans get to know about Lisa for example jungkook is greatly shippers with her and jungkook is arguably the most popular one of bts.
