Other pop/rock tunes have used a full symphony, but this was a unique track because the orchestral part at the end was not composed, arranged or written out. Each player created their own part on the fly, creating an original texture out of the John Lennon\u2019s imagination, as directed by producer and classically trained musician George Martin. It is the largest mass improvisation AFAIK. In symphonic parts, the large numbers of players typically all play the same note at the same time in sections. This was some 80 individual lines that converged into the famous piano chord, which also set a record for being the longest - because it was actually longer than recording technology allowed at that time. The Beatles 'A Day In The Life' Is A Landmark In Sound Engineering 50 Years After It Was Recorded A different question answered by others is which concert piece used the most instruments, and I believe the record goes to Hector Berlioz\u2019s contribution to the 1855 Paris Exposition when he conducted 1200 orchestral players. They coudln\u2019t all see him at once, so he used a newly invented electric metronome to synchronize several sub-conductors: The Hector Berlioz Website ",

            "answer_text": "A totally un-researched stab in the dark here, approaching this from the angle of ''most different types of instrument'' rather than most musicians and I am avoiding classical music because anything with a symphony orchestra will feature a great range of instruments as well as many musicians (likewise ''big band jazz'')... Some of the densest instrumentation I can recall is in the soundtrack to the 'Last Temptation of Christ', as presented in the album 'Passion' by Peter Gabriel. Cheating, a little, the album 'Atom Heart Mother' by Pink Floyd includes choral and orchestral sections. Surely there are other prog rock examples by the likes of Yes/Rick Wakeman? - he toured the USA with an orchestra for his album Journey to the Centre of the Earth. Prog is not my thing so someone should be able to offer an answer for ''most instrumented prog'. In electronica, I think I would plum for Susumu Yokata (try 'Sakura' or 'Boy in the Tree'), or something by Gel-Sol, both of whom produced very dense, multi-layered music. World music-wise: a gamelan record must have it. ",
