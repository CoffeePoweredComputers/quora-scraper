            "answer_text": "Music tastes differs from person to person. So first I\u2019m gonna put up a test for you so that you can understand what kind of genre you are into. Hear these songs first: Linkin Park(LP): Numb, In the End, Leave out all the rest, One more light. Greenday: Wake Me Up When September Ends(WMUWSE) , 21 Guns, Good Riddance, American Idiot, Holiday, Still Breathing, Revolution Radio. AC/DC: Highway to hell Metallica: Fade to Black Iron Maiden: Afraid to Shoot strangers. Eminem: Loose ureself, Not afraid. Bruno Mars: Billionare. After hearing all the songs, if you didnt like any of the above except Eminem and Bruno Mars, then most probably you like pop/hiphop genre. If so, start listening to Eminem, Coldplay, Rihanna and other artists like them. Im sorry but i dont listen to pop so i have no idea about it. If you liked Numb, In the End, Leave out all the rest , WMUWSE, 21 Guns then you definitely like rock. Congrats! You can start listening to songs of Breaking Benjamin, Skillet, 3Day Grace, 1000 Foot Krutch and ofc Linkin Park and Greenday If liked American Idiot, Holiday, Revolution Radio( if you liked these songs then most probably you liked the above songs too) then you like Punk rock. Great! You can listen to Yellowcard, Papa roach, Sum 41 along with the other bands aforementioned. If you liked Highway to hell, Fade to black, Afraid to shoot strangers, then you are a \\m/ METALHEAD \\m/. You like the genre metal. That is awesome. Not many people nowadays listen to metal. You can start from Avenged Sevenfold, Iron maiden, Dream theater, Metallica, Nirvana. If you liked all the songs then that means that you are a very versatile listener. You enjoy all types of genres. You will enjoy all the songs mentioned above. \\m/ ",
