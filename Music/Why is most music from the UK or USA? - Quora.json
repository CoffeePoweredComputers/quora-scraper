            "answer_text": "It isn't.  You seem to be projecting your own lack of knowledge.  If you go to East Africa say you will mostly hear benga for North Africa and the middle east Arabic music with a touch of French. There are a huge swathe of Indian music styles with millions of followers. The main thing that western music has is big business pushing it into foreign markets and a belief (sadly too often correct ) in tourist destinations that their customers do not want to be too challenged by the local culture. I love many types of western popular music,  but it is not the major music type listened to by all the world.  The sad thing is that there is a massive amount of other music out there and it is a pity that more people don't turn off the same old same old that they get from their local media and listen to it. It has never been easier. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is most of the music \"you listen to\" from the UK/US?  Similarly why are most of the films you watch from Hollywood?  The culture you live in probably does not have a great market for Turkish language songs or Bollywood films.  You see a lot more English language music and English culture films as these are the products that sell in your market. English is also a massively popular second language, so even in non-English speaking countries, there are waiting consumers. So if English language product is what sells, where is the easiest place to make it? Somewhere like France where English is a second language for most artists or the UK / US where there are large populations of native speakers and lots of affluent consumers to buy product? ",
