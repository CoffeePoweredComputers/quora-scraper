            "answer_text": "\u201cAnd if I claim to be a wise man, Well, it surely means that I don't know\u201d \u2013 Kansas, Carry On Wayward Son Kansas - Carry on my wayward son - Lyrics I admit, I first heard this song when I was watching Supernatural (yes, I didn\u2019t \u2018inherit\u2019 my dad\u2019s music tapes and I\u2019m not a 60s baby, I\u2019m a petty 17 year-old who knew it through a 2000s TV show, sue me). For a person who\u2019s in a moral dilemma almost all the time, I relate to every lyric in this song. This lyric in particular brought a philosophy of mine to life. It\u2019s a very simple yet rather powerful principle, which I\u2019ve held to myself for as long as I can remember. I wish everyone thought like this. As overwhelming as it can be \u2013 to realize how insignificant you actually are \u2013 it can also be incredibly relieving. Knowing the insignificance of oneself, as in staying hungry for knowledge yet acknowledging the fact that no one can be perfect or have full knowledge or know the full truth, is one of the most peaceful states one can be in. Knowing to unknow, accepting what others have to say, realizing that you\u2019re never alone, that the world doesn\u2019t end at your deepest trail of thoughts, it keeps you humble. It enables people to listen to others without judgement, truly seeking to understand this person and vice versa. In my opinion, the world generates itself on the conflict of interest, which is, indeed, a way of survival. Less reasons for conflict means more power to the people. It\u2019ll seem like I\u2019m going off on a tangent but hear me out. I often wonder if conspiracies are real, and if so, I wonder how can one person be such a mastermind? I\u2019ve contemplated this for a very long time, until I realized that people can only be this great when they work together. It seems like most higherups and people participating in dirty politics realize this philosophy to their own advantage, subliminally engraving things into those they seek to control, from racism and xenophobia to which fast food chain makes the best fries. It can only be overcome if people set aside their differences with others, and learn to love rather than to prove their prides and egos right. If I claim to be a wise man, then it surely means that I don\u2019t know. ",

            "answer_text": "This answer was inspired by a conversation between me and my best friend.[1]  The lyrics to Lane Boy by Twenty One Pilots are really interesting to me because they touch on an important subject: The importance of vulnerability and the correlation between flaws and authenticity. One particular line that struck a chord in me was: Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless The thing that really stood out to me about this lyric is something that we overlook so frequently. Everyone has flaws and everyone has insecurities and vulnerabilities.There's not a single person who can claim they're flawless and perfect. Every single person has challenges of their own, their own battles, their own flaws. Public figures and celebrities are great examples, but there are many day to day examples too. We've all come across that one person who seemingly has their life together and everything worked out at a super young age. The ones who get good grades, have already paved a plan for their future, get accepted into Harvard, people we'd call highly successful. It's easy to look at such people and assume they're \u201cperfect\u201d. After all, they seemingly have it all, what could they be lacking? But here's what the line Don't trust a perfect person means. Because what you're seeing is just the surface. Underneath this seemingly always jolly, life collected together, highly successful and talented individual is a layer we're not seeing. Beneath those high grades are nights stayed up stressing and overworking. Beneath the career choice paved at a young age are countless panic attacks and sleepless nights. Beneath the talent is a layer of insecurity, of low self confidence, of a fear of failure. Beneath the good looks are layers upon layers of self esteem issues and years of battle to love and accept themselves. I find this lyric really powerful because we often tend to look at others who are seemingly more successful than us and have their lives together and feel inferior. We attribute a false complex of superiority and perfection over these people, while forgetting that beneath the outer layer is an internal layer much like our own. There's a lot beneath the skin that we don't know of. Therefore we need to stop thinking of ourselves as inferior, but rather as equal: we're both humans with challenges of our own. We're both successful in our own ways. Having flaws in your work, as opposed to being \u201cperfect\u201d is what retains creativity.This ties in with the rest of the lyrics: Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless, honestThere's a few songs on this record that feel commonI'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currencyMy creativity's only free when I'm playing shows When Tyler refers to singles on the radio, he means songs that are \u201caccepted\u201d and \u201cflawless\u201d. They're \u201caccepted\u201d enough to become mainstream. But he writes about how striving for this perfection kills creativity, and more importantly, authenticity. I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin' Here we see that Tyler sees a constant conflict between his creativity and what the trends are. And it explains his dilemma about choosing creativity over mainstream acceptance, but he then says and don't trust a song that's flawless which means he sides with creativity and authenticity over mainstream \u201cperfection\u201d. In simpler terms: perfectionism kills creativity, but more importantly authenticity. You're not sticking true to yourself, and when he says to not trust a flawless song he means that pieces of work that are generally considered \u201cperfect\u201d or \u201cflawless\u201d often lack authenticity. We also see in the music video for Lane Boy, where Tyler is standing in between two people with hazmats. One one hazmat it says \u201cfame\u201d and on the other it says \u201csuccess\u201d. The video shows Tyler kneeling down to \u201cfame\u201d and \u201csuccess\u201d before standing up and dancing to the beat, letting his creativity flow. Pretty powerful imagery. Underneath every song (or any piece of work) which is polished and perfect, is a layer of doubt and insecurity.This is similar to point 1. We're seeing the end result which is a polished piece of work without seeing the hours of stress and doubt behind it. Tyler writes about this dilemma in another song from the album, Stressed Out: I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heardI wish I had a better voice that sang some better wordsI wish I found some chords in an order that is newI wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang Here Tyler openly writes about the challenges and insecurities he faces when it comes to songwriting, and I think the lyric and don't trust a song that's flawless Is a powerful way of saying that underneath every supposedly \u201cflawless\u201d or polished work, is any amount of dilemma, insecurity, doubt, the usual challenges behind every creative work. This is something I personally relate to, writing on Quora being my metaphorical \u201csong\u201d. Overthinking every word, fussing about my word choice, constantly changing things to make it just right, needing that push and encouragement to be able to actually upload at times. A lot of the times we look at songs that become popular and successful, forgetting that behind that song was a similar struggle. Here \u201csong\" refers to any work. Twenty One Pilots have been pretty open about this and the creative struggles that go behind their songs.  It's often easy to look at others, at other's works and to forget that underneath that layer shown to the outer world, they're a human with human struggles too. Underneath the layer of perfection, of flawlessness, is imperfections and flaws. Something I tend to struggle with at times is low self esteem by always comparing myself to others better off and more successful than me. And admittedly, I forget that underneath that success is much of the same non-pleasant bits that everyone goes through. This lyric particularly stood out to me and I've been thinking about it for a while. Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless  Footnotes[1] Amy Smith",

            "answer_text": "There is a song with one brilliant line after another with each verse increasingly spellbinding, building to a deep, dark climax . Dip into the song almost anywhere and there is the most amazing imagery in any single line. That song is A Hard Rain\u2019s A-Gonna Fall, written byBob Dylan when he was only 20 years old in 1962 and it is as relevant today as ever, if not more so. Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son? Oh, where have you been, my darling young one? I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son? Oh, what did you see, my darling young one? I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin' I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin' I saw a white ladder all covered with water I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son? And what did you hear, my darling young one? I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin' Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin' Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son? Who did you meet, my darling young one? I met a young child beside a dead pony I met a white man who walked a black dog I met a young woman whose body was burning I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow I met one man who was wounded in love I met another man who was wounded with hatred It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son? Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one? I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin' I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest Where the people are many and their hands are all empty Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten Where black is the color, where none is the number And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' But I'll know my song well before I start singin' It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall ",

            "answer_text": "As a self proclaimed music geek, I would have to say that my preferable music genres are extremely varied. From punk and rock to jazz and musical theatre. However in a song what I really look for are lyrics that speak to me. They tell a fragmented story, which the listener should piece together by their individual tastes and preferences. Just as one does when reading poetry. So it's no surprise that my favourite song lyrics is pretty deep. \u201cSometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same\u201d comes from the chorus of the song All At Once by The Fray. I guess this piece of text can speak to people on different levels but for me it delves down and tickles my nerve endings. It shows that life isn't easy and as humans we have a hugely varied life, from challenges with race, gender and illness to the positives of equality and diversity. In the context of the song title it also shows that life doesn't stay still. It can change dramatically at any given moment. As a result of this humans should try to be as present and \u2018in the moment\u2019 as possible to gain the most of their life. In reflection I think I like this song lyric as it shows us that life is an uphill battle. Something to fight for rather than something to browse. We should be proud we have been bestowed our lives and live them as best we can. Always focusing in the present moment rather than in the future or past and 73% of humans aged 13\u201325 do. Live in the moment folks. Regards Rainne ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, here's my pick: Oasis - The Shock of the Lightning\"Love is a time machine, up on the silverscreen.\"  I was a huge fan of Oasis for their poetic take on lyrics, and this one struck me the most. Dave Matthews Band - Crash Into Me\"Hike up your skirt a little more, and show your world to me.\" Now, this was more out of shock value than anything, because it took the song on a different turn when this part was played.   Duran Duran - A View to a Kill\"A sacred 'why', a mystery gaping inside\" This stood out for me because it was uncharacteristic for Duran Duran to get metaphorical with their music, and for it being the song to the James Bond movie of the same title. Tracy Chapman - Talkin' Bout a Revolution\"Don't you know? Talkin' bout a revolution it sounds... like a whisper\" My dad had brought me up listening to Eric Clapton, The Beatles, and this lady.  And this song got me reflecting my life on countless occasions during my teenage years.  \"Fast Car\" is another great song from her. Lady Gaga - Til' It Happens to You\"Til' it happens to you, you don't know... how it feels\" Here's my wildcard pick for the kairos appeal.  This song is powerful in many ways, and speaks out to sexual abuse and violence.   However, it can be related to any hardship in life, as there's more than meets the eye.  Everyone is fighting an invisible battle, and it's imperative we understand and most importantly, embrace that.  I can go on and on about the social implications of this, but that will be left for a different thread. ",

            "answer_text": "A group that has sooooooo many good lyrics it is hard to pick just one is Quasi. They were a married couple that got a divorce and still continued to make music together. They were also friends with, and the backing band for Elliott Smith. Here is just one of their amazing lyrics : And the children of privilege begging for my spare change, do they need my assistance to purchase their intoxicants, or would they best be served a swift kick from the song California :  Another great line from their song The Happy Prole : You need the money so you got to play it dumb, but if you play it long enough it\u2019s just what you become.  The Old 97\u2019s have some fine writing skills, and one song in particular is called Barrier Reef, with these lyrics : What\u2019s so great, about the barrier reef, what\u2019s so fine, about art, what\u2019s so good, about a good times van?  One of my all time favorite bands for well written lyrics is the Canadian band The Weakerthans. The songs have some of the best lyrics I have ever read in my life. Here is an example : When you get off work tonight, meet me at the construction site, and we\u2019ll write some notes to tape to the heavy machines, like \u201cwe hope they treat you well, hope you don\u2019t work too hard, we hope you get to be happy sometimes\u201d. Those lyrics are from the song My Favorite Chords :  One last lyric from The Weakerthans : I swear I\u2019m going to bite you hard and taste your tinny blood, if you don\u2019t stop the self defeating lies you\u2019ve been repeating since the day you brought me home, I know you\u2019re strong. The song is from the point of view of the cat, it\u2019s called Plea From A Cat Named Virtue, and it\u2019s one of the best written songs ever :  Anyways, that\u2019s my contribution! ",
