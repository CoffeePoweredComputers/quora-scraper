            "answer_text": "You want an entertainment company to sponsor a random person\u2019s kpop group? You can request as much as you want the chances of it happening would be pretty slim. The only cases I can see this working is. You\u2019re from a rich, influential family(chaebol) & your parents put in the request to one of their business friends. Basically you buy your fame.You make the request to a small, poor company. You present them a group of good-looking & talented people & prove that you\u2019re all ready for debut & they won\u2019t have to spend a cent for training. Better be amazing.You & your group have already somewhat debut & are popular in entertainment circles. You make a name for yourself & make connections with influential people in the idol industry. Again you\u2019ll have to do most of the work & prove to these companies that you\u2019re worth their time & money.",
