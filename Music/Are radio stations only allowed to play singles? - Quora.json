            "answer_text": "It depends on the the kind of station. Even in our internet world where you can select the songs you want to hear and never listen to a radio station, radio is still popular with a lot of people. And in an effort to meet the needs of the listeners, most commercial radio stations have what is called a \u201cformat.\u201d This refers to the type of music programming you will hear on that station. For example, top-40 is one type of format; it is often aimed at teens and young adults, and it plays only the biggest hit songs on the pop music charts (based on requests, digital downloads, sales of CDs\u2014 which some people do still buy\u2014 etc). Originally, back in the early 1950s, stations were like jukeboxes and they only played about forty songs over and over. Today, while top-40 does have a lot of repetition (the term for this is \u201crotation\u201d\u2014 heavy rotation means a song is a huge hit and is played more often than a song that\u2019s not as well known and is in a lighter rotation), there are very few top-40 stations that just play 40 songs. Today\u2019s top-40 format usually has some recent hits, a few up-and-coming songs, and even an occasional oldie in addition to the big current hits. Another format is called album rock. This style of radio plays the biggest and best tracks from the albums of popular artists, as well as new music, recent album tracks, and older tracks. For example: where a top-40 station would just play the hit song from an album, an album rock station would also play some tracks that were not hits but are still great songs. And that\u2019s the answer\u2014 a top-40 station generally restricts itself to singles, or to the one song on a new album that is perceived to be a hit. Stations that feature other formats (album rock, jazz, world music, dance music, just to name a few) are not restricted to just the hit single, so they will play a wider variety. Thus, it\u2019s not that a station isn\u2019t allowed to do X; it\u2019s that the station\u2019s listeners expect a certain format, and the station\u2019s deejays tend to follow along with what their audience wants to hear.

In addition to this many stations run structured music playlists and formats, and these formats often contain rules to prevent music from the same artist being played back to back. I hope that helps.
