            "answer_text": "(It would seem that I may have misunderstood the question; please forgive me for this! I'm not sure of the merits of leaving this comment standing unedited, but do so in the hopes that it may give another viewpoint to the general question of doubling. The background for my answer has to do with the antiquated practice, once popular in the USA, for requiring all those desiring to play saxophone to play clarinet first, sometimes for several years, before allowing them to switch to or add saxophone later. Again, I beg your forgiveness.) Absolutely not, at least if one wants to really excel on each instrument. There may be other contingencies that make it advantageous or even financially necessary to learn both (and these contingencies are quickly passing away), but there really are no musical advantages to the idea. The negative is unfortunately the very same thing that some are going to mention as a positive: the respective tightness (and direction) of the embouchure for each instrument. The problem is that some see a single reed and assume that is enough of a similarity to help develop the other. One must continually keep each approach separate in the mind in order to play each instrument correctly. Expecting the clarinet\u2019s requirements to affect the saxophone's embouchure positively is setting oneself for mediocrity that will have to be overcome later. This is especially true if both instruments are started before either embouchure is fully matured. Originally, if one was to work (particularly in a pit band setting or wedding setting), one had to play both instruments. There are reasons why this is an antiquated thought. First, in most pit bands now (due largely to financial constraints), key or wind synthesizers are used for a majority of all the wind instrument parts. Second, except for some occasions, due to the loss of popularity of the saxophone in contemporary popular music, the emergence of the DJ at social gatherings, and the increase of the use of the synthesizer and/or backing tracks for smaller bands, sax players are often not hired for wedding bands. The clarinet, of course, faded from popularity at the end of the swing era. The generation that requested swing music and polkas has subsequently largely passed away (now, the elderly request 60's rock; again sax and clarinet is not much of a consideration for that). People who loved the Beatles are now in their sixties and seventies. The reason I bring this up is that the primary professional reasons for playing both instruments are largely gone and I may be being even more forgiving with the financial exigencies of clarinet playing (in a popular setting) than have been extant for quite a number of years now. I've been playing professionally for over forty years. In all that time, I've been requested to play clarinet a total of five times. In each case, my lack of expertise on the instrument was not a deal breaker for the gig as I mostly picked up the clarinet part on tenor or soprano sax (in one case, I played the part on flute). This is not to say, however, that a music teacher, seeing that he/she has too many saxophonists for use in his/her concert band will use this ploy (using the clarinet to build a sax embouchure) in an attempt to shore up the weaker clarinet numbers. I've seen this more often than I can count. Do you want a stronger saxophone embouchure? The answer is extremely simple: practice your saxophone more. Make sure to practice conscientiously your long-tones. Do not just go through the motions with this: listen to yourself as you play very critically. Play harmonics and fundamentals off of your low B flat, B natural, C natural, and C sharp on the octave, octave and a fifth and so on. Match the tone and pitch of the standard fingerings to the harmonics as they occur. If you want to play saxophone, play saxophone. And if you still want to play a second instrument, start a harmonically capable instrument like piano or guitar so that you can understand jazz harmony better to aid in your improvisation. ",

            "answer_text": "No. If your goal is a good emboucure for sax, then playing the sax for an additional one or two years will be better than playing clarinet and then having to transition and unlearn things. Others have answered that it's easier to go from clarinet to sax than from sax to clarinet. But that's a different question. If you want to do both instruments, then it's probably true that it's best to start with clarinet first. But, I don't think you gain any real advantage in sax embouchure, which is your question. I wanted to play sax as a child, but was told I had to play clarinet first. So, I did and then switched to alto sax a year later. In reality I think that was just a way to avoid having 15 saxes and 2 clarinets in the band.  Play sax if you want to play sax. Your embouchure will develop as a result of years of dedicated practice. There is no other way. Time on the clarinet will not speed that up or make you better.  ",
