            "answer_text": "How\u2019s your dance?? Btw: Disclaimer: [ I\u2019m not a judge to tell you exactly how your dance is. As I myself know how to dance\u2026.. more like freestyle Dance I do at home. I also sometimes make my own dance moves. But besides that. I\u2019m not a professional dancer or a judge. So I\u2019m judging based on what I think. Thank you for reading:).] Ok so, here I go: I give your dance a sold 7.5 to 8.5 or 9 out of 10. Here\u2019s why: I think your dance was really good. I liked it. It\u2019s nice. However: first 3 seconds of the video: The moves were like a box. I don\u2019t want to sound rude because like I told you I really like your dance. But, like the 6\u20138 seconds of the video was a good. But the beginning overall like the first 3 seconds was just: \u201c what is that?\ud83d\ude10\u201d I\u2019m honest with you by the way. I\u2019m sorry if I sound rude. I apologize if I do. But trust me I\u2019m not. Umm\u2026. Ahem\u2026 what was 24\u201326\ud83d\ude36. Ok\u2026 \ud83e\udd14\u2026. Your dance Kind of reminded me of NCT dance moves like Kick it. Lol I\u2019m sorry \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80. Overall, nice dance. It\u2019s really good. For a person to creat their own dance is really cool. So I appreciate your effort you put in. It was good after all. So good job \ud83d\udc4f. Also: [ I saw this question but it got deleted as soon as I finished typing my answer so I kept as a draft because I thought the question would come back up. So I\u2019m smart for doing that\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0c. I also was toooo lazy to type it again because I was in class during my online Webex meeting lol and also answering the question. But as soon as I clicked: \u201c Submit.\u201d It said: \u201c Question been deleted.\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201c Excuse you\u2014 WHAT?? Hell no I'm saving this as a draft!!!\u201d Lol \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude2d. Well, that\u2019s all I have. Have a great day:)   Edit#1: I noticed your facial expressions as well. They were ok for a person to audition. But I think if you also practice on that you can pull off good facial expressions and make your dance look good, nice. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s a solid audition! Clean and sharp moves, right on the beat, and your sense of rhythm is amazing. I do have two tips though. First thing: Your choreo a bit repetitive. I can\u2019t distinguish each part from another because it\u2019s all very similar. I think you might want to think about tweaking some of the choreo. Second thing: Facial expressions. You need more of that, because I don\u2019t see any. It\u2019s very important because what is art without expression? So work on that, and maybe also read the lyrics of the song to really understand what it\u2019s about. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s about being extremely happy or if it\u2019s about being the best. You gotta try to figure it out, and express what you think the song\u2019s about. ",
