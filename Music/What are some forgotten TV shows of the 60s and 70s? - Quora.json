            "answer_text": "I read this question last night and researched a bit and slept on it. I came up with 3. The first one was Room 222. It played in the late 60s and early 70s about Walt Whitman High School. It was on Friday nights between The Partridge Family and the Odd Couple. I don't recall that it had a laugh track. I don't know that it's \u201cforgotten\u201d but I don't recall it ever being shown in syndication. I'm not sure why. It was a quality show. Next is \u201cThe Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\u201d. This was a quirky show that ran from 1959\u20131963. The lead character was a high school kid trying to find his way. He would frequently break the fourth wall attempting to justify or explain his thought process. This show featured Bob Denver pre-Gilligan's Island, as Maynard G. Krebbs who was a stereotypical beatnik, complete with a little van dyke-type beard and a set of bongos. (Picture Gilligan, but cool!). Finally a show I thought was awesome but lasted only a little over 20 episodes. SEARCH, which was also called PROBE. It was about international private eyes, but these guys were high tech. It was the early 70s so the high tech aspect was super futuristic. The lead character(s) rotated, being played by Tony Franciosa, Hugh O'Brien and Doug McClure. Venerable actor Burgess Merideth also starred as the guy who monitored the giant computer screen/data base/communication center, none of which existed at the time, at least not in any way that the average citizen would have been familiar with. It was a pretty cool show but wasn't on very long. ",
