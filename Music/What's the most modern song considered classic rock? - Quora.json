            "answer_text": "This is hard to answer because what is \u201cconsidered Classic Rock\u201d is not widely agreed-upon (see What is classic rock?). Most people think of the genre using the circular definition \u201cit\u2019s what my \u2018Classic Rock\u2019 radio station plays\u201d but the term Classic Rock is not really hip any more and few stations define themselves that way. A lot of stations that are classic rock at their core also throw in more modern songs, blurring the lines further. Classic Rock radio began to diverge from just plain \u201crock radio\u201d in the late \u201970s as disco and punk started to splinter and divide the listeners into camps. See Around what time did classic rock stations first begin appearing, and what did they play? for more on how this happened. Once Classic Rock became a genre unto itself, only the occasional new stuff by groups (or solo acts from groups) already ensconced into the pantheon could enter, along with a few throwback groups whose popularity among classic rock fans could not be ignored. (Thus Don Henley\u2019s \u201cDirty Laundry\u201d and Van Halen\u2019s \u201cHot For Teacher\u201d from 1984 make it in, while R.E.M., The Replacements, and even Queensryche tracks from the same year don\u2019t). The most recent songs you\u2019ll find in the libraries of most Classic Rock stations are from the very early \u201890s, in the form of early Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers tracks. The door to Classic Rock really slammed shut with the appearance of Nevermind and everything after that would be Alternative, Modern Rock, or something else. FiveThirtyEight did an exhaustive statistical analysis of what gets played on \u201cClassic Rock\u201d stations a couple of years ago, and this table tells part of the story:  Why Classic Rock Isn\u2019t What It Used To Be To be pedantic, \u201cmost recent\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to \u201cmost modern\u201d. The few acts that straddled Rock and New Wave probably qualify (U2 remains popular on classic rock stations, as do The Police and The Clash, and The Cars sneak in on some playlists). But given that The Lumineers and similar rootsy bands continually top the Alternative charts today, you might find that The Band and other acoustic artists are also pretty up-to-date. But if your station plays \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d by the Beatles (1966!), you probably can\u2019t get more modern than that. ",

            "answer_text": "I would argue \u2014 strongly and forever \u2014 that The Wallflowers, in all their 50%-of-Bob-Dylan\u2019s-DNA-meets-Bruce-Springsteen-stadium-rock grandeur, definitely counts as a Classic Rock act. They were called Alternative Rock in their heyday, but the genre was never an accurate fit; they\u2019ve always sounded like they recorded the bulk of their catalogue 10 years earlier than they formed. Thus, \u201cOne Headlight\u201d may well be the last popular Classic Rock song from the youngest big Classic Rock band. \u201cRebel, Sweetheart\u201d may be the last great Classic Rock album. (As they formed in 1989, The Wallflowers are newer than other modern-ish Classic Rock acts \u2014 like Guns \u2019N Roses, which was formed in 1985). An alternate viewpoint is that U2\u2019s probably put out something in the last 20 years which could count as the last great Classic Rock hit\u2026 \u201cVertigo\u201d, perhaps? Matchbox Twenty often sounds more like a Classic Rock outfit than like anything else. More Than You Think You Are is an insanely great, beautifully knit-together album, and its feel is vastly more Classic Rock than it\u2019s given credit for. Or maybe it\u2019s a Train song (someone\u2019s calling \u201cBlasphemy!\u201d, I\u2019m sure, but I adore Train) \u2014 \u201cDrops of Jupiter\u201d has a classic church-rock vibe, and \u201cI Got You\u201d is so Classic Rock, it even absorbed some of the Doobie Brothers\u2019 \u201cBlack Water\u201d. Hell, Garth Brooks\u2019 \u201c8teen\u201d sounds like a lost Bob Seger track, and it\u2019s from 2016. I like to think this means Classic Rock will never truly die\u2026 The answer might even be Adele\u2019s \u201cRolling in the Deep\u201d. That\u2019s a goddamn instant classic if I\u2019ve ever heard one. Most Classic Rock DJs would likely disagree with almost everything I\u2019ve said here \u2014 but, meh, what do they know, right? They\u2019re mostly just paid to flog nostalgia. But if everything old is truly new again, and since I mentioned Bob Dylan roundaboutly: \u201cPay In Blood\u201d is a bitchin\u2019 modern Classic Rock song from 2012, absolutely one of the master\u2019s very best. Stylistically, it belongs on any Classic Rock station worth its salt, and it also kicks the ass of most of what those stations are already playing. Maybe it\u2019s the last great modern Classic Rock song, and maybe Tempest is the last great Classic Rock album. Again: I hope there will be many, many more. We need some depth and musicianship carried forward past the age of self-aggrandizing rap, hip-hop, and vacuous pop. ",
