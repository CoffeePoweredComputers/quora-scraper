            "answer_text": "I don't particularly hate \u201chate\u201d him. There are some moments that I am proud of him and other times that are not. In one of the answers, it stated that this Army had a \u201clove-hate\u201d relationship with him. I guess it's the same thing as mine except that he's not my bias. I love him cause he always hypes up the members. Like when no one claps for this particular member he'll be there to do it and even leads others in hyping him up. I also like that he's talkative (though it is also one of the reason I dislike him) because it lifts the mood up a lil bit. I like his voice and I like Promise. I also like that he plays with other members a lot plus I like it when he makes funny moments during run and bon voyage. Now comes the part in disliking him, Well, what I don't like about him is that his voice in live performances is not really stable I guess? I like it when he sings in a range he's comfortable with. I don't like it when he sings a way too high range cause it's obvious he's not that good in doing it (only when dancing). Of course it's not his fault but I remember when I tried listening to them live, I kinda regretted it a bit? Taejin and especially Jungkook was stable but Jimin's a little off. I also dislike that he's a bit too greedy for attention. I don't know if it's just his personality or something but I don't like it when he tries to act cute in front of the cam too much. This is my opinion anyway and him trying to act cute kinda makes me see him as an attention whore I guess? Not in a bad way tho but yeah. Lastly, I know this is an old matter but this is also one of the few reasons why I disliked him a lil bit more. I've just watched their Festa 2016, and in the part where they stated comments, or more like, complaints, towards each other, one of Jimin's complaint from the members is that he is indeed a bit greedy for being the center. Tae pointed it out but it seems that the other members experience the same sentiment as him. At first I shrugged it off, cause aren't we all? We all are greedy for attention and we can have a tendency to act a lil bit selfish and that's totally ok. Idols are humans and they're allowed to act like an ordinary person. However, I can't help but remember that moment everytime I watch a BTS related content. That though just pops randomly in my head that's why in some moments, I feel a bit annoyed by him whenever he tries too hard in front of cam or during performances and stuff. Yup, that's pretty much it. I mean, even if I admit that I dislike him sometimes, there are a greater amount of moments that I loved him cause he'll always be the mochi in my heart \ud83d\udc9c ",

            "answer_text": "I have read almost all the answers and few have already answered the question. So, I'll keep my answer very short. First of all, I couldn't understand when someone says you are not ARMY unless you love everyone equally. I don't think that's the highlighted rule. If I remember it right, Tae once asked ARMY to love everyone equally. But, there is no written rule like that. Honestly, even people who claims themselves to be OT7 have some preferences. So, I'll go against some people who already have written the answer and say that, if you don't like any member, that is completely perfect unless you are toxic. My ultimate bias is Taehyung. Taehyung comes first and I love all the other members equally. I tried not having bias but I didn't succeed. Tae is my bias but that doesn't mean he is very much perfect for me. I don't want him to be perfect also since he is a human being. Being imperfect in few things is also a part of his charm. Same goes for Jimin too. He doesn't need to perfect in everything and people should accept it . Otherwise, if the stans claim him to be so much perfect, it's going to be a pressure for him. I know whatever I have written is totally not relevant to the question. I wrote it because of some absurd answers that was written already. Now these are the reasons that I can relate to why people hate Jimin but will not go in detail. First of all, I feel like he is an attention seeker and someone made a good justification citing Mama speech, Tae and Jin fight as an example. He has got a very good voice and I appreciate promise and serendipity but his on stage performance is very much unstable and sometimes he even makes it worse while doing a high note. I fell for Filter and that song has made me crazy. I got addicted only to know that I felt it very synthetic for me and I have to wait and see the stage performance of it before judging. His dance is very good and he has really worked hard but that doesn't mean only he is working hard. I feel that everyone in BTS, is working hard. Jin starts taking dance lesson on choreography to be on same page with other members. Even someone gave interview on how Suga got fainted on backstage after completing the performance. I am sure everyone knows about JK's incident. Same goes for everyone. Everyone is working hard and we should accept it. I hate it personally when some Jimin stans argues how Jimin works harder than others. I personally portrayed him as an angel few months back and now I understand that he is an angel ofcourse but that doesn't come so natural to him. He takes care of all the members so much to a point that it doesn't needed in camera ofcourse. Joon being the leader of the band, helps each of the members. Suga 8takes care of everyone in a very subtle way. Tae looks like he doesn't care for anyone but he cares even for the staff members in shoot and fellow idols. I am sure all members take care of eachother and that's the biggest strength of BTS. So, Jimin doesn't need to be sensitive about it in camera and show it explicitly. We can understand him very well that he is caring even if he is not showing it on camera. And the last point which I think some people hate him is because of shipping and some even threatened him. Since, it is not my page,I will not make a comment on that. These are my opinions on why some people hate Jimin and I want everyone to respect it instead of teaching me how Jimin is so much perfect.
