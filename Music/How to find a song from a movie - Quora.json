            "answer_text": "Abraham Carreto's answer to How do I find a song from a movie? is accurate, but it does leave out the most obvious solution: watch the end credits. Every song used in a movie must be cited during the credits, displaying the title, songwriter, and performer. And because the songs are generally displayed in chronological order, it\u2019s not super difficult to figure out which song is which.  And of course, there are two more basic solutions: Google any of the lyrics (adding the word \u201clyrics\u201d to your search), or ask the music expert in your life. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "If the movie has been out for a while, you can use the IMDB website or app for the soundtrack or original score. Additionally, searching up the movie on Spotify or on YouTube might present the soundtrack as well. Finally, if the movie you\u2019re watching is still in theaters, you can use Shazam. I\u2019ve been to a lot of movies in the past year and most of the time, a Shazam promo is presented before the movie starts. Occasionally, I see a promo for another music identifying app called SoundHound which in my opinion works just as well, if not, slightly less than Shazam. Just make sure to lower the brightness and switch your phone to silent before you do it, though! ",
