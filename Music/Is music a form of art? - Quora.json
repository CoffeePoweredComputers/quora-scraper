            "answer_text": "Most people talk about creativity. And of course I agree that that's definitely one of the prerequisites for something to be art. But I think good art also asks questions or proposes new ways of, in the case of visual art, visualising things. Art is also about broadening your view of the world, challenging your thoughts and exploring new possibilities. That is why there are art works that some people find hard to understand. I think it is the same with music. Is really all music art? It depends, I think. It depends on its purpose. What if we have an AI creating music? Would the AI be able to create art, even though we view art as something that is created by humans? To me, the music is then reduced to a set of formulas. Just as what already happens today with a lot of music reaching the charts. We can still love and enjoy music like that, of course. But music that is challenging and is looking for new ways of expression will never reach a large audience. That's because the goal of the piece is completely different. Next to being entertainment, it also asks questions; is this still music? Or is it merely an arranged composition of sounds? And if the music cannot be enjoyed, is the music still good? Is all music meant to be enjoyed and nothing more? When does music stop being music? I think it's important to consider these things when thinking about art. ",

            "answer_text": "If you search up the definition of \u201cart\u201d on Google you will find that it is the application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in visual form. However, art cannot possibly be categorized with one simple definition. Because various art pieces are subjective, the definition should be subjective for each artistic individual. For some, art may be the result of strenuous work and effort on a project while using an imaginative or creative twist. For others, it may be a collection of emotions and thoughts a person has combined in order to create a piece of entertainment for others to enjoy or think about. The definition will differ for anyone you ask, unless they all got their answer from a common source. If you consider music a form of art, that means you believe it fulfills the requirements of your definition of art. Once again, this varies from person to person, so this question cannot be answered with facts. It all depends on your opinion of what art is, which means this question does not have a definite answer. Like all art, it is simply subjective to your needs, opinions, and experiences. ",
