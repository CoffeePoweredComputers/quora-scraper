            "answer_text": "Sure you can. It can even sound good. But there\u2019s a catch: you can\u2019t use the guitar amp\u2019s speakers. Or rather, you can\u2019t if you plan on playing at any reasonable volume. The speakers meant for guitar use are too lightly constructed to handle the huge waveforms of bass frequencies at high volumes. The wide cone excursions needed for bass can cause guitar speakers to blow out in short order. But if you are fine with that and are willing to use your own bass speakers, a guitar amp can sound quite good for bass. You\u2019d even be in good company using them. Back in the early days of bass amplification, many 1960s bassists were aware of their desperate need for large amounts of power, and would often trade their 50-watt Fender Bassman amp heads with their guitarists who bought 100-watt Fender Dual Showman amps and found them too loud. One such 1960s bass player famous for using guitar amps was Billy Cox of Jimi Hendrix\u2019s band. In the photo below, he is shown using six 100 watt Dual Showman amp heads, each with its own Guild bass cabinet, in the stage rig of the shows that would result in Hendrix\u2019s Band of Gypsies album.

            "answer_text": "Yes, at low volume. I did that for 6 months before I bought a small Orange Bass amp. The difference is that you get lower bass and truer sound from a bass amp. Heck, I even got an amp that is good for Keyboards. It is all about optimizing the amp for the frequencies outputted and to what degree. Your guitar amp does produce bass, but not to the magnitude of a dedicated bass amp. You will see, as I did, the big difference in sound with a dedicated bass amp. However, you an use a guitar amp for a bass guitar just like you can use a wrench to hammer in a nail instead of a hammer. They both work, but the hammer does the job better. Just do not crank up the power because your speakers were not designed to constantly produce heavy bass all the time. If you use a tube amp or head, you may have problems. While I say that I used a regular amp for my bass for months, it does not mean you can with your amp not knowing what kind of amp and its power output. You can find YouTube videos showing people playing bass through regular amps. ",

            "answer_text": "As per the other answer, a guitar amp can be pressed into service for bass practice at low volume. Guitar amp speakers aren\u2019t designed for bass frequencies or to move as much air as a bass speaker - you will destroy the speaker if you start cranking it. On the other hand, you can use any bass amp as a guitar amp with no issues. For example, Fender Bassman tube amps seem to be more popular as guitar amps than as bass amps. ",

            "answer_text": "The risk is speaker excursion at higher volumes. Most of the answers saying that the guitar speakers aren't rated for the low notes are wrong. Or partly wrong. Bass amps frequently use the same speakers as guitar amps. HOWEVER, they use closed-back cabs instead of the open cabs of guitar amps. The air pressure in the cab helps prevent the voice coil jumping out of the gap in the magnet. Tim \u201cMilkman\u201d Marcus assured me that my Half and Half, a great steel amp, will be fine to gig with my Kay upright (with Realist pickup) as long as I unplug the built-in speaker and use my closed-back extension cab only. You should be able to find a used 4/10 closed-back cab for cheapish. ",
