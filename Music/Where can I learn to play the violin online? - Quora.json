            "answer_text": "Well, it really depends on your goals. Can you probably learn the basic setup (i.e., how to hold the violin , bow, and how to stand) from a video? Yes. You can get the gist of that from online sources. However, when it comes to the actual mechanics/physical aspect of playing the violin, you will be very limited. You can definitely watch videos with violinists explaining how they achieve a specific technical goal. In fact, that can be quite helpful in general. The problem is that without feedback, it\u2019s difficult to really know whether you\u2019re exercising proper technique or not. In reality, as a beginner, you don\u2019t know what it is that you don\u2019t know. So that makes it very difficult to know what to adjust/correct. And even if you do know what\u2019s wrong, there is no one who can look at you and/or listen to you, and tell you what you (specifically) are doing that\u2019s causing the problem and, more importantly, how to fix that problem. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom though. There are some people who would be willing to offer private lessons via Skype (or similar platforms). Additionally, I believe there are some programs where you can purchase/download a lesson from a website, take a video of yourself, and send it to the instructor for comments. Obviously, the aforementioned approaches mean slow progress, for what already is, a really difficult instrument. Not to mention, it takes a while before people can usually even make a nice sound on the violin. But again, it gets back to your goals. If you just like the violin, and you want to learn a little about it and be able to play some simple tunes with the instrument, online lessons can probably achieve that goal. (If you\u2019re open to another instrument that would work well, I recommend the piano. The piano is difficult in different ways. But the benefit for a beginner is that one can at least make a decent sound almost right away and pluck out a tune. That will not happen on the violin.) Again, I say none of the above to discourage you. If you want to use online resources, go for it. You\u2019re just looking to learn a little, and frankly some instruction or guidance is better than none at all. So if you\u2019re just looking to try out the instrument and learn a little, there\u2019s no harm in that. Just be mindful the information above. ",

            "answer_text": "I must say the I pity you, depression and mental exhaustion really can suck but I think I\u2019m going to have to burst your bubble here and for doing that I feel horrible. The reality of the situation is no you can't. Whether you are an adult or a child beginning an instrument is much more than just playing notes, it has to do with technique, theory and small things that build you as a musician. These cannot be taught by an online teacher only by someone with a professional degree that can actually look at your performance and help you on a personal level, these are things that online courses really can't provide. With you saying that you find violin relaxing i can understand that it is an extremely beautiful instrument when played right but thats when its played right. The violin is a very difficult instrument it\u2019s sort of like a cat in a sense that it is an absolute ass hole to you. I\u2019m not going to lie to you when you first start playing it does sound like a cat yowling and it can take a lot of mental energy not to just go \u2018Ahhhhhh forget this!\u2019 which can make it quite mentally challenging as well but once you get to a certain level it sort of just clicks and it feels like you've been playing forever. If you really want to learn the violin try as hard as you can to get physical lessons, if there is something holding you back such as your mental health you could probably just talk to someone to try and find a suitable teacher that can be understanding of your situation and help you through it. I hope this helps in any way :) ",
