            "answer_text": "As mentioned in the other answer, Lenny Zakatek was the lead for Games People Play (GPP), one of my favorite songs. All in all, he sang on a total of 8 Alan Parsons Project (APP) and related albums, including other songs like Damned If I Do, I Wouldn\u2019t Want To Be Like You, Too Late, and You Don\u2019t Believe. To see Lenny in action singing GPP, check out the official music video on YouTube. Outside of the Project, he has had a long career with other bands as well as solo. To find out more about Lenny, check out his Wikipedia page, his official home page, and his page on The Avenue (official APP fan club). To see all of his work for APP, see the Monster Discography ([not well] maintained by me). ",
