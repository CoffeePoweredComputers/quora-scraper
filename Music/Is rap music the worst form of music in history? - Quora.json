            "answer_text": "As an ex-rapper and rap producer I\u2019m a little bit subjective. But what you must understand is that the rap isn\u2019t only what you see on the TV (that\u2019s mainstream rap and it\u2019s chosen, probably, by guys who have no knowledge in Hip Hop as a culture). Rap is the only genre that allows full creativity, anyone can do it and get his point across. What you see on the TV is probably what they want you to think it is (eg. Calling trap, mumble rap, music Hip Hop is almost degrading to the Hip Hop culture). We are diverse, yes\u2026Indeed some of us only rap about \u201cdrugs and hoes\u201d, others are \u201cgangstas\u201d, others are people rapping about uplifting their community, others are battle rappers (all they do is fighting other rappers on a lyrical level) etc. When you buy a rap album, you buy a story, and yes, some of us became millionares and if they rap about struggling they would be considered hypocrites (and most of the Hip Hop heads will considered fake). For example, you can listen to all of Jay-Z\u2019s albums and you will hear his rags to riches story, you can listen to KRS-One, who is all about uplifting his community (as he remained there, even after his albums popped) or you can listen to new mumble rappers (some of them are so drugged that they can\u2019t really rap their rhymes). It\u2019s really about relevance, I like KRS and Guru (from Gang Starr, RIP) which are all about uplifting people, but I also listen to MOP (this is relevant to me too, despite their violent messages, because I grew up in a rough community).

            "answer_text": "Hi. In considering my answer, I am a professional drummer for over 40 years. I have also had a few music courses on a college level. Genres I have played, and genres I enjoy include: Rock, pop, power pop, r&B, Motown, blues, classical, hard Rock, limited amounts of metal, southern rock, country and western, and more. So no, I have not included rap in this list. There are a variety of reasons that people listen to music: dancing, spiritual motivation, pure enjoyment, to be uplifted, and more. I haven't and still can't connect to rap on any of these levels. It does absolutely nothing for me. So on a purely personal level, yeah it's pretty darn bad. Having said that, it cannot be ignored how popular it is. It has sustained overtime, and has evolved as well. Huge audiences connect to it on many levels. It is an unique way to express heartache, discontent, and angst for a huge group of followers. It is a formidable financial entity generating jobs and sales of music. As a personal footnote, I've enjoyed seeing videos online of rappers & hip hoppers reacting to music other than that. Reacting to rock and things that ordinarily these fans never listen to. So let me be the first to admit that they seem to embrace songs I like more than I would embrace rap songs. Bottom line\u2026 I suppose it depends on your definition of worst. Thank goodness that there's enough music 4 people anywhere in the world to enjoy. ",
