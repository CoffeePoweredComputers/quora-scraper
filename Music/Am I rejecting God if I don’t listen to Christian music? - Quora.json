            "answer_text": "What is \u201cGod\u201d or \u201cgod\u201d, really? Well, in a metaphysical sense, it might be possible that there is one \u201cGod\u201d. But that is not the reality here on Earth. On Earth, there are many \u201cgods\u201d, proclaimed by PEOPLE (not a God or Gods) who make a lot of noise that their \u201cgod\u201d is THE \u201cGod\u201d. ABSOLUTE COMPLETE FUCKING BULLSHIT. The real situation is that everyone on Earth has their OPINION of what their god is, and then takes that same OPINION and tries to sell you it as being \u201cTHE GOD\u201d. That does not change the fact that this is their OPINION. An opinion is not a fact. When you die, if there is such a god or God, then you might be in a position to discern what really is fact. Until then, everything on this Earth, except perhaps mathematics and a few other exceptions - everything else is one person\u2019s opinion. There are 330 million people in the United States. As a result, there are 330 different version of \u201cgod\u201d too. Just like you will never please all 330 million people, you will never please all of their respective \u201cgods\u201d either. Everyone wants to be \u201cGod\u201d. Everyone thinks that they are \u201cGod\u201d and good. The fact is, no one is \u201cGod\u201d, regardless of what they think, and no one can prove with factual empirical evidence that is recognized by accredited professionals that such a \u201cGod\u201d even exists - and the defense to this statement is usually a politically-charged comeback. If your \u201cgod\u201d feels that your are reject him or her, because you are not following petty rules and jumping through hoops, then that is simply what you believe. Maybe you are right, but I doubt it. If I was \u201cGod\u201d, I think I would be much more concerned about what people actually did, than their taste in music. If I was \u201cGod\u201d, I would not be so lacking in self-confidence that I needed to be serenade by pious zealots to give me validation. Those emotional problems are symptomatic of those who create those own \u201cgods\u201d and superimposed them on an unknown metaphysical deity, and not such a deity itself. Here is the reflective problem: If A = 1, then 1 = A, right? Therefore, if \u201cGod\u201d \u201callegedly\u201d made man in his own image, then the opposite is true: MAN MAKES HIS VERSION OF GOD IN HIS OWN IMAGE. Each person\u2019s god and belief system is merely a reflection of their own psychological makeup, cultural world view, insecurities, values, ideas and beliefs - but has nothing to do with a metaphysical deity that no one can prove even exists, yet make wild claims that they have a direct communication channel to (and only if you send $19.95 and get the Jim Bakker audio tapes\u2026). I have gotten pulled into many religion conversations, despite every effort to change the subject and keep my mouth shut, because for some reason, Mark D. Gerardy\u2019s personal \u201csalvation\u201d is of paramount importance to them, or so they can confuse their politics as somehow being charitable work. Short List of Some Religious Psychological Traps: Collective GuiltCircular ReasoningFearGroup-ThinkBuilding a logical house of cards on assumptionsHearsaySpeculationSpeculating on the Intent of othersPoliticsCulture WarsProjecting own\u2019s own insecurities onto the feelings and motives of an alleged dietyThe Style PoliceLabeling everything that does not fit one\u2019s extremist bias as \u201cNew Age\u201dLabeling the reasonable middle-ground as \u201cbias and radical\u201dWhat feels goodDefensive Posturing: \u201cRegardless of what I have done, if you hurt my feelings in any why when calling me out, then I am absolved of all sin and then YOU are the one who is morally-wrong: because you hurt my feelings\u201d (that are impossible not to hurt by calling someone out in the first place).I rattled off that list in less than two minutes. There are a lot of very intelligent people in this world, some of which have their act-together, and some of which still do dumb things. And there are a lot of indoctrinated people, some are \u201cChristians\u201d, and many have used their faith in the name of many good things - hospitals, universities, research - and some have also used their faith in the name of lynching and firebombing. The same is true with the Muslim faith, there is much good in the same spirit as the Christian faith, and then there are folks who fly airplanes into building in the name of their so-called \u201cGod\u201d. I do not believe in worshiping unreasonable or cruel gods or \u201cGod\u201d. If this so-called spiritual path is going to be fraught with listening to this music, having this style of clothing, believing these tenets, treating this group this way and that group that way\u2026then honestly, I would be seriously-questioning the validity of such a religion. What really matters? If I was a hippie and cut off all my hair, then would you care? Should you care? Would a \u201cGod\u201d really care? Now if I flew a jumbo jet into a skyscraper, then would you care? Should you care? Would a \u201cGod\u201d really care? I am not going to live my life tiptoeing on the narrowest of tightropes to placate a fertility cult full of power-hungry bullying hypocrites that call themselves a church, such so they can get their jollies off about adding another spiritual-zombie and political foot-soldier to their flock to dominate and control, because they attempted to scare the Hell out of me and I was a fool enough to believe their propaganda. If any such deity expected me to perform spiritual-gymnastics and live in fear my entire life of \u201cnever being good enough\u201d, then I would reject such an evil and cruel god. It is not difficult to discern what is good and what is not. While many churches are indeed good and can and do many good things for a lot of folks, nonetheless, there are a large number of folks who do not require remedial training in ethics. I cannot say the same regarding a number of parishioners and churches themselves, and they know that too. ",

            "answer_text": "Er no. I'm a Christian albeit not a very good one and I don't listen to Christian music. Christian music encompasses a huge number of genres from hip hop to heavy metal. And although there's one or two which are good and even in some instances broken into mainstream, its not my cup of tea. Theres certainly no commandment to listen to Christian music in the Bible. Although we are advised to be careful in everything. 1 Corinthians 6 v 12 Everything is permissible for me\"--but not everything is beneficial. \"Everything is permissible for me\"--but I will not be mastered by anything. So no you aren't rejecting God by not listening to Christian music. In fact that could be taken the the nth degree\u2026you reject God if you don't shop at a Christian grocery store, don't buy soap made by a Christian soap maker, watch ChristIan TV, shine shoes for black people (the latter has been suggested by a so-called Christian who runs a Fried Chicken chain of restaurants-FORTUNATLY there none of his white-hating crap outlets here in the UK! ) and don't buy your fried chicken from our friend. If you want to listen to Christian music then fine. If you don't then that's also OK. Chick-fil-A CEO urges white people to 'shine a black stranger's shoes' ",

            "answer_text": "The point of the church, and everithing it does is to spread the joyous word (prostylaterisation) by converting nonbelievers, and to guide the christian communities with the accordance with his word (the bible). Christians tend to employ various tactics to preach and convert non-believers, or to encourage people to live a sinless life, among them, music, due to it\u2019s widespread popularity as a source of entertainment. Music is mostly used for the latter purpose (encouragment to lead a moral life) because people who listen to christian music are usually\u2026christians. Music can be a good way of doing this, but can also be misguided, as people who write the music are often not the people who can correctly interpret the bible (I\u2019m speaking from a catholic standpoint, but this is also true if the messeges in the song don\u2019t correlate with your own denomination) . It is not required to listen to christian music to lead a virtous life, as even a virtous pagan can enter heaven if he leads a moral life, the only problem is that for that pagan it is difficult to lead that life as no one ever thought him how to lead it, whitch is the purpose of the priests. I\u2019m sorry for the grammar errors, english is not my first language. I hope you can understand my anwser. ",

A lot of Christian artists are insincere or mixed at best, they preach and sing on stage and get drunk and seduce really innocent girls backstage. Christianity is a schtick for them. A way to make money and get noticed when they wouldn\u2019t have in secular music. There are many reports of Christian artists not being what they claim to be. Mainstream music has many Christians and they\u2019re honest about not being perfect and try a lot harder to live better lives. I\u2019m sure that there are many Christian artists that practice what they preach and that\u2019s ok. Just be wary of anyone who claims to have all the answers. I think real Christians understand that they don\u2019t always understand or know what God wants of them and they\u2019re going through a spiritual journey like everyone else. ",

How would they know? Are they there by his side? If you live a life that you feel is right and do everything you can to show that you put in the effort and belief that his way is what you want to go. Nobody is perfect, and nobody has a better picture in his eyes because of the fact that we are all making mistakes, and that`s not the point, the point is that if you do make a mistake and realise it and put some effort into correcting it. The intentions and actions will define what your relationship with God and whethter or not you`re rejecting him and his offered helping hand. We were given a great number of abilities from free thinking to making choices, the ability to construct systems, to create art if these abilities were inherently evil, why would we have them? It is how you use and understand them. Hopefully this mess is helpful. ",

Life isn\u2019t so black and white. That is just plain religious and God is not so rigid that he doesn\u2019t allow musicians to know him regardless of their style or talent. We bring glory to God by realizing his ultimate sacrifice was to give us his son Jesus to reveal his true love for us. Praise songs are pleasing to the Lord and uplifting spiritually speaking, but music and the different styles and songs out there can just be a form of relaxation and enjoyment. Music helps me out through the day and I admire many different styles and songs. ",

On the other hand, listening to music or doing any other form of entertainment is not rejecting God per se.. but it can affect your stand against God (assuming you're a Christian) depending on what kind of music or what form of entertainment you chose. With that said, just bear in mind that music with negative influence will also have negative impact on your spirituality. ",
