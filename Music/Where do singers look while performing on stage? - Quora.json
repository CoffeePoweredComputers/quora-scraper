            "answer_text": "It depends on the singer really, I used to look at everything. I\u2019d look at my band mates during certain parts of a song especially if it were a new song and I\u2019d just check out the audience. I\u2019ve known other singers that check out the audience for obvious groupies and he\u2019d scout out the hottest girls to hit on later. You can ask 100 singers and probably get at least 10\u201320 different answers. Funny story though, I knew Johnny Winter and he was always great to watch when he performed. I remember one groupie who was up front trying to get his attention and finally he was looking in her direction and she was thinking she was finally going to get to jump up on stage with him and made so many gestures at him as to indicate she wanted on stage. Finally a stage hand did bring a couple of girls up on stage and then even back stage. I was backstage and could hear her talking and was all excited saying that she just knew when Johnny looked at her that he would pick her to come backstage and be with him. I was feeling kind of obnoxious so I went up to her and said \u201c You do realize that Johnny is as blind as a bat without his glasses and couldn\u2019t even see you don\u2019t you?\u201d She obviously didn\u2019t believe me until they got done playing and Johnny came back stage and someone handed him his glasses. Johnny was vain enough to where he didn\u2019t want to wear glasses on stage. Finally he did get some Lennon style glasses with tinted lenses and wear them at least part of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on the context. Generally we face out towards the audience, but in opera, for instance, it's often necessary to sing more across the stage. We do our best to avoid ever singing upstage (away from the audience) except in quick turns or for effect. Otherwise, we typically sing to the lights or the exit doors. During an operatic performance, like a play, you have to acknowledge the laws of acoustics while trying not to abuse the fourth wall. In recital, it really doesn't much matter where you look, but it's preferred you sing to your audience. Part of that involves eye contact, but if that bothers you, try singing to the empty seats between concertgoers or just over their heads. I don't recommend thinking of them in their underwear, since that does more harm than good (it seldom calms nerves, but is likely to make you \"giggly\" or repulsed for some audience members). For singing sacred or church music, either take up a beatific, worshipful prayer look (i.e., shut your eyes), or brave up and look your congregation in the eyes. In a worship context, part of your job will be proclamation, so look at your audience like you mean what you're singing about. Now, all that is where singers should be looking. If you want to know where some of them DO look (besides where they're supposed to), the simple answer is \"anywhere they want to.\" But you've probably seen enough singers to know that, and to perceive that many of them have poor audience rapport because they don't make eye contact (or close to it).
