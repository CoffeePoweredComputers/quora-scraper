            "answer_text": "Not really; the notes actually increase for each semitone by an increasing amount. An octave is a mathematical increase of frequency of sound in which the high note is exactly twice the frequency of the low note in the octave.  This means that they are not evenly spaced, but increasing geometrically, doubling the number of cycles for each octave. For example, the frequency (According to Wikipedia) for C0 is 16.352 Hertz (cycles per second).  The frequency for C1 is exactly twice that (32.703 Hz).  The next octave up, C2, is twice C1 (65.406 Hz).  C3 is twice C2 (130.813 Hz), and so on until you reach C10 (16744.036 Hz), which is the last C a human can hear before the next C, which is beyond the 20KHz limit of human hearing (33488.072 Hz). By the way, This doubling of frequency is the reason that a C sounds like a C, regardless of the octave that it is in; for every one cycle in a lower C, there are exactly two cycles of the higher C. With that being said, this double-doubling also occurs in other notes.  F5 (698.456 Hz) is twice that of F4 (349.228 Hz), E2 (82.407 Hz) is twice that of its lower-octave sibling (41.203), and so on. Finally, consider the difference between C1 and C\u266f1 (1.945 cycles) and the difference between C\u266f1 and D1 (2.06 cycles).  Each is exactly one semitone, but you notice that the space between each increases. The space between D1 and D\u266f1 goes even further (2.183 cycles).  In fact, the increase itself increases for each semitone (the first increase was 0.115 cycles, and the second was 0.123 cycles). As you can see, the notes are not evenly-spaced in frequency; due to the nature of sound, the frequency difference increases with each semitone in order to simplify the divisions used in most musical theory today (it's easier to memorize 12 semitones per octave than consider that vast increase of frequencies for each increasing octave).

            "answer_text": "No, the notes in an octave or, to be more precise, no consecutive musical notes(in chromatic scale) are equally spaced.Mathematically, the musical notes form a Geometric Progression(G.P) and not an Arithmetic Progression(A.P) with a common ratio of 2^(1/12)(i.e. twelfth root of 2 or 1.059) Now, music as we know it today has developed over thousands of years and there must be a reason for why we have settled for 12 notes in an octave and that too not equally spaced.If the music was only about progression of single notes or just melody then this would not have been the case but music is also about harmony. (When more than one note is played at a time, the resultant sound is called harmony). In other words, it is not only about different frequencies but also about how these frequencies interact with each other. When humans realized this, they simply observed and came up with current structure (of dividing an octave into 12 notes with each note being (2^1/12) times the preceding note). Some of the observation which ultimately led to it :1) When two notes, with one being double the frequency of the other, are played at the same time, it sounds good.2) It also sounded good when the frequency of the higher note was about 7.4 (i.e 7*2^(1/12)) or 5.3 (5*2^(1/12)) times higher than the lower note(i.e. the higher note was the fifth note or the third note on the major scale starting with the lower note).  It was observed that this division of octave could accommodate most of the harmonies (or chords) efficiently and that's why we settled for it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, they\u2019re not. In Western music, there are 12 different notes, which means that an octave uses 7 notes, and skips 5. The reason for this is actually very simple: in any scale, the 7 notes you play are next to each other on the Circle of Fifths. Now, I highly recommended anyone to play around with the Interactive Circle of Fifths, but I\u2019ll share three exampleS, starting with one using the Locrian scale, since it otherwise doesn\u2019t get much use.  So, we\u2019ve circled from F to B, so there are no sharps or flats, and we\u2019re counting from the seventh window, so the scale starts with a diminished triad (the chord played using the first third and fifth notes in the scale). Now, if we wanted a natural minor scale with three flats, we\u2019d start our seven-note circle from A-flat, and start counting from the fifth note:  Lastly, if you wanted a standard major scale with 7 sharps you\u2019d start the circle from F-sharp through B-sharp, and start counting from the second note:  Notice also, in this last example, that E-sharp and B-sharp are being used instead of F and C, to allow us to still use all seven letters, and because it would be harder to write a scale that had F & C AND F-sharp and C-sharp.

There are 12 notes in an ocatve including sharps and flats and each is the 12th root of 2 more than the previous so after twelve notes it'll be exactly double the frequency which is the definition of an octave. the twelfth root of two is approx 1.0594630943592952645618252949463417007792043174941856... so each note is approx 6% higher in frequency then the next lower note.

            "answer_text": "The octave on stringed instruments is almost never an exact factor of two because of a phenomenon called \"stretch\", which is well known to piano tuners. This causes C5 to have a slightly higher frequency than 2C4, etc., for every note. Stretch is a mechanical property of strings with finite width; therefore, in the ideal, theoretical chromatic scale with infinitely thin strings, there is no stretch. Stretch is caused by the fact that width of a string adds stiffness to the string properties which adds a restoring force which increases the frequency. Stretch is important because octaves must harmonize; eg, the harmonic of C4 must harmonize with the fundamental of C5, but the harmonic of C4 is stretched, so C5 must be de-tuned to harmonize. To answer the other question, all the notes in an octave are exactly evenly spaced in logarithmic space for equal temperament. This means that the ratio of frequencies of any two adjacent notes is always the same (twelfth-root of 2 = 1.05946).  For explanations of the chromatic scale, equal temperament, stretch, etc., read chapter two of my free downloadable book at Fundamentals of Piano Practice: free online piano lessons - learn, teach piano  .

It sounds flat. We have to do what is called stretching the octave, so the top C is not actually 128 x the frequency of the lowest C although in theory it should be. Basically this does not become a problem until the last (top) 25 or so notes. This was explained to me by at least three piano tuners over the years. ",
