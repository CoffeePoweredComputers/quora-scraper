            "answer_text": "You're confusing Contralto for Alto. A contralto is the rarest of the female voices. It is characterized by having an androgynous tone. Many contraltos can sing easily down to C3 or lower! But some trained contraltos can reach high C. Annie Lenox is a colorura contralto that sings high C. An alto is a female member in choral music that sings the first harmony line under the melody line, typically a third. Almost all altos would be classified as mezzo sopranos who have a slightly lower tesiturra than our soprano 2 sisters. Sopranos almost always have the melody. But sometimes the soprano line splits into 1 and 2. Soprano 1s sing above the melody line while the soprano 2s stay on the melody. A true contralto would be best suited to singing with the tenors because she would unbalance the weight of the alto section. The weight and color of her voice is too heavy and rich. There are exceptions, of course. A range of notes does not define a voice type. There are several factors. For instance, my singing range is E3 to F#5 though I can phonate down to C3 and up to C#6. By just this range of pitches I could be any of the female voices. But let's look closer. The weight of my voice is light and lyrical, bright but with a warmth to it. So that rules out me being a contralto. I don't have the defining characteristic: an androgynous tone. That high C could mean I'm soprano. But the clarity of my tone starts to change when I get into the 5th octave. I have to put more energy into singing above C5 whereas sopranos come into their own in the 5th octave. I'm not a soprano. My tesiturra, the range of notes that I don't really have to think about and that come naturally, is F3-C#5. This makes me perfect for the alto part in choral music. I am in fact an alto 1 though I usually sing alto 2 when we split to help balance my choir's alto section. But if I had the training and the inclination to sing classical music my voice would be most suited for mezzo soprano roles. I'm a pop world mezzo that sings the alto part in choral music. Don't get caught up in what your voice type is. It doesn't matter! ",

Are you taking vocal lessons? I think you need to develop your higher range more. Unfortunately, I really can\u2019t provide much. I don\u2019t know much about your voice other than what I stated above. I don\u2019t know what type of music you like to sing or what type of music your voice would actually suit. ",
