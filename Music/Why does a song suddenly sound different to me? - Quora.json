            "answer_text": "I really wonder about this too. I'm a music producer, sometimes I work on the same song for 10 hours straight. I have experienced, both on my own songs, and on other songs, that what I am hearing can instantly change. I am not talking about the feeling of the song, the sounds that I hear literally change. I think it happens when you get used to a certain sound. Your brain just ignores it. But I also think that the way we hear music changes greatly as we grow and become more experienced listeners. As a teenager, I was exposed to a lot of jazz music, and I hated it. I still remember how the songs sounded to me. Now, those very same songs sound great. I think my inexperienced ears were unable to comprehend the unusual harmony of jazz when I was younger, and I sort of slowly grew into the understanding I have now. ",

I have been wondering why this could be and if perhaps exposure of them during sleep has something to do with this. So far I haven't been able to find any evidence to support this but I can't help but shake the feeling that listening to the music while your sleeping affects your perception of the songs when your awake.
