            "answer_text": "It' s certainly true that on average a song lasts about 3 minutes. Sometimes people ask me HOW to compose a song of about 3 minutes. I give them a fairly basic A B A pattern of a 4 bar introduction, 8 bar sentence that is then repeated with a modification the second time to effect a modulation to a related key. Then comes the \u201cB\" section in that related key which itself can be repeated with modifications at the end to modulate back to home key and repetition of \u201cA\" twice but 2nd time not modulating. There then follows a 4 bar Coda to round off the song. So, we have in bar terms: 4 (intro)+16 (A+A1) + 16 (B+B1)+16(Ax2)+4(Coda) =56 bars. Let' s set the song in 4/4 at a speed of around a crotchet/quarter =80 and do a simple calculation: 4 beats in a bar x56 = 224. 224\u00f780=2.8 or just under 3 minutes. Factor in \u201cemotional\" responses so that the tempo fluctuates, and you have a song around 3 to 3 1/2 minutes or so. Now obviously few songs will keep strictly to the sort of format I have underlined here! But I' ve given a basic sort of pattern at a very elementary level (and a lot of pop music is \u201cprimitive\"). It works at a primal level because the simplest music is readily understood by the public at large through the principles of repetition and easily assimilated melodic and harmonic formulae + rhythm. Now Bohemian rhapsody broke new ground (in pop music) because it departed from the highly repetitous sort of format outlined above by adopting \u201crhapsodic\" notions\u2026that is to say, it became longer by introducing more diverse material. To do this, it incorporated certain elements learned over the years by classical musicians to prolong their compositions. This is why Bohemian Rhapsody is more \u201csophisticated\" than your average two a penny pop song, bdcause it borrowed from classical music masters. ",

            "answer_text": "It is really hard to say when that formula started. But yes, in the early days of Top 40 (now called contemporary hits radio), most stations refused to play a song that was more than 3 minutes. I don\u2019t know if the idea was to appear to play \u201cmore songs per hour.\u201d Most stations in that format tended to say \u201cmore music per hour\u201d or \u201ckeep it here for better music.\u201d Even though I had time as a DJ and yes, I had to say things like that even on a country station. LOL In fact, the Beatles with \u201cHey Jude\u201d was one of the first exceptions to that rule. The radio landscape started changing around that time too. AOR, which stood for album oriented rock, came out and changed those rules some. The main purpose of that format was to prove there were great songs by the artists of the day that were not singles but just as good. This format had many spin offs including todays \u201cclassic rock\u201d and \u201cmodern rock\u201d formats. Around the time Bohemian Rhapsody came out, it was more of a fight with the record company. Led Zeppelin faced the same with \u201cstairway.\u201d The rules had changed but the record companies were still reluctant to release things over the 3 minute pop song. It was amazing to see what would be done to get records on the air. One form was payola, which was not legal. LOL Yeah there was always that fear that radio stations wouldn\u2019t play it. Top 40 radio started to expand to maybe 5 minutes as the time changed. I think it was the arrival of AOR on the FM band that changed the rules there. ",
