            "answer_text": "It's difficult, since one's muscle memory have developed in such way that the vocal cords just want to sing the right note naturally.But, it's possible, and we have one case for that. Ever heard of Miranda Sings, one of the most popular YouTube sensation lately. Go watch her videos and you will see that she intentionally sings off-key all the time and it's difficult to understand her entertainment if you are a trained singer/musician/listener. But, Miranda Sings is just an alias of Colleen Ballinger (a.k.a. PsychoSoprano), which is actually a very good and talented singer. You can even watch some videos consist of duets between Miranda Sings and Colleen Ballinger, which is amazing for the idea that one person can have 2 personalities that is way too different. According to her wiki (Colleen Evans), she was a private vocal and piano coach and featured on Disney films, such as High School Musical. I don't know if there's any singer like her. If there happens to be any, feel free to mention them here. EDIT: I've just found out that Lea Michele, being a great Broadway singer as Rachel Berry on Glee, was able to pull off a 1 minute intentionally off-key rendition of Miley Cyrus' The Climb.   ",

            "answer_text": "My youngest sister was an excellent clarinet player from elementary school onward. Her pitch when singing is excellent although she has never been interested in singing in a choir or otherwise performing as a vocalist although she acted in theatre for years. What's hilarious is when she can intentionally do her \"bad singer\" character and sing an entire verse or refrain just far enough off pitch to freak out those around her. My mother was a choral singer who taught us well, but my stinker of a sister is an excellent comedic actress who knows how to torture singers in particular. My sister has the feel for comedic timing to tease a listener into believing that her pitch is going to improve and then ZAP, and she is hitting some horrible note that is not in the chord and raises the hairs on your arm nearly as much as fingernails scratching a chalkboard. I sing choral music where I have deliberately cheated a bit sharp on certain notes to keep my section from going gradually flatter (below the correct pitch). The director of our church choir is good about pointing out places where a section needs to cheat a bit sharp to keep things on course in a capella pieces as we rehearse them. It is helpful to mark the score for such spots so that a vocalist can pay extra attention to any places just before that note or section. Often an instrument or another vocal part will sing the note before it occurs for the section that is having trouble hitting it correctly. As has been noted in another answer, if a choir or soloist sings a piece where the accompaniment ceases for a section and them comes back in it becomes painfully obvious if the vocal part sagged off pitch because the tuned violins or piano will come back in on the higher but correct pitch.

            "answer_text": "Yes, I do it all the time. I sing in a variety of choirs. In long unaccompanied passages the choir often sinks out of tune.  With the orchestra coming back in soon, it's imperative to get the choir back on pitch. I will sing just a tiny bit sharp of the choir.  The people around me will go sharp to compensate and the rest of the choir will follow them. Then I'll repeat the process until we're back in pitch.  ",

Once you've spent a long time developing a mental image of what the notes and intervals are supposed to sound like, and cultivating all the right habits to make them come out like that consistently, it's tricky to be convincingly sloppy on cue.
