            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A.The question is very vague and unclear, so I assume you are referring to the front seats specifically and independent rear seats (captain seats as they are known). Its quite amusing to imagine driving a car sitting in the center, apart from it being very impractical. I think having seats in the corners and not in the middle has the following advantages.1. Ingress/Egress is much easier.2. You wont be sitting too close to be comfortable.3. On undivided roads (2/multiple lanes without a divider), you get a much better view of the oncoming traffic, extremely useful and  important when you are planning overtaking manoeuvres. 4. The equipment (manual/auto gear lever, cupholder, console, etc..) can be placed in the centre  avoiding fouling with your legs when getting in/out. This space can be shared between both driver and passenger.5.  In case of an emergency (an accident), its much easier for the rescue team to extract occupants through windows (assuming doors jammed).I could think of these few. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is the driving seat of a car not in middle? Safety.Positioning the driver on the side near the middle of the road helps the driver to see further forwards around bends. For a bend that curves to the same side that the car is driving on, the driver is away from the inside of the bend, so can see much further around it. For a bend that curves to the side away from the side of the road that the car is on, the whole car is on the optimum side to see forwards around the bend, and the driver\u2019s position across the road is further away from the inside of the bend than in the previous case, so given the same mirrored road geometry he can see even further around the bend in this case. If the driving seat was in the middle, the forward visibility in the first case would be severely reduced, but there would not be much advantage in the second case, which has the better view forwards anyway.
