            "answer_text": "In my experience, drinking water, green tea, black coffee, a small glass of wine, or 90% dark chocolate can all help to supercharge your brain, although what helps even better than all these can be, believe it not, not eating something. Make sure to get enough sleep. Good quality sleep. It can make such a difference, especially as one ages. But think back to when you were very young, too, and how much getting good sleep could help you or your children function better. A ten to twenty minute nap can help you recharge! Fasting helps, too, honestly! Don\u2019t eat continuously. Try to not eat for at least 12 hours. Cutting back on carbs and sugars can work wonders. Don\u2019t make drinking alcohol a regular habit, especially binge drinking. Exercising vigorously can help with lifting brain fog, too. So far as best food goes there are foods you can eat that definitely can help memory and cognition, however, the effect takes longer, such as good high fats foods like nuts, nut butters, avocado, extra virgin olive oil, fatty fish, and also make sure you are eat more greens, a variety of fruits, especially berries, lots of different vegetables, too, and try incorporating anti-inflammatory turmeric or curry into your diet. Some people swear by sniffing mint or citrus or rosemary. I am not so sure. I think there are other things that people use to supercharge. I haven\u2019t tried them. Some seem risky. Like the high caffeine energy drinks or even certain supplements. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Your brain is 80% omega-3 fatty acids by mass. Eating fatty fish, flax seeds, and a few other similar foods on a regular basis help make sure that building and repair resources are available. B vitamins are used to produce ATP (internal batteries) from fuel. You can get B vitamins from meat, eggs, leafy green vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, etc. They are fat soluble vitamins. The brain needs about 400 calories per day (300\u2013500 depending on person and who you ask). The brain prefers lactate as its number one source of fuel. This is an adaptation so that when running to catch that prey, your brain can still operate on the anerobic byproducts of hard exercise. In western society, we don\u2019t have high levels of lactate very often, so our glial (brain support/structure cells) convert glucose into lactate. That makes glucose the primary food source of brain energy. Too much, the body freaks out, so this is best to be a trickle throughout the day. The glucose can be produced from non-starchy foods, so eating grains and potatoes is not \u201cgood for your brain\u201d. That kind is good for muscles when you\u2019re on a 5 hour hike. Depending on your genes, additional antioxidants can be helpful. Clean-up of junk throughout the body, including the brain, uses toxic, oxidative chemicals. Once they do their job, the body uses anti-oxidants to deactivate them. Some people either produce too much which needs cleaning up, or produce too much ROS to do the cleanup, or too little of the antioxidants to deactivate them. Things like fruit, berries, vitamin C, and some more unique chemicals from other foods, can step in on this role. This is more of a concern as people get older, since cleanup is slower, repair of damage is slower, and accumulation of damage becomes larger. Lastly are various drugs and hormones which can come from foods, from just being healthy, or from medical and non-medical sources. Any function of the brain, or blood flow, or all sorts of things can be adjusted. Typically, this is reserved for people who have an actual dysfunction, because there are almost always negative side effects. If you have concerns, then a medical doctor should be consulted, and they can help identify the dysfunction, and whether there is anything safe which can be done. In addition to what we eat, other things that help the brain measurably are exercise, relaxation, and friendship. All three of these things are shown in multiple studies to improve cognitive functioning for most people. ",
