            "answer_text": "We use it in motion, sending rockets to space, keeping the car steady while moving across a bend and determining stock values, determining the flight path of a projectile/ball. But perhaps one of the most relatable applications of calculus occurs when you go by a long distance average speed camera placed on long motorways. Unlike instantaneous speed cameras which take note of your speed at a given time and location, an average speed camera doesn\u2019t even capture your speed. Instead it simply takes a photo of your vehicle when it passes the first camera, and then again when it passes the second camera, and measures the time interval between the two images. Using this information it can determine whether or not you\u2019ve oversped. How? The answer is the Mean Value Theorem. This theorem states that if you have a continuous and differentiable function f, the slope of the secant joining two points at a and b must be reflected in the slope of the tangent along the interval (a, b) at least once. In other words the derivative of the function somewhere in the interval must equal the average gradient at at least one point in that interval. Average speed = actual speed somewhere in the journey. An illustration shown below, notice the gradient of the tangent at the point c is the same as the gradient of the secant line from a to b. Or mathematically, there is some c in the interval such that [math]\\displaystyle \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c)[/math]  The mean value theorem tells there is at least one pt c with the same gradient as the secant, so there may be more:  Thinking back to our speed camera case, if you know the average speed the car did by using the time difference across a fixed length of road, then you also know the car had to have equalled that average speed at least once in the journey. Thus if your average speed ends up being over the speed limit, it can be deduced you exceeded the speed limit at least once in the journey, hence a fine in the mail. However, if you do exceed the speed limit somewhere in the trip, you might not get caught, because you can still adjust the rest of the journey by slowing down so that your average speed is under the speed limit, where the theorem cannot say you exceeded the speed limit. If your average speed > speed limit = you exceeded the speed limit at least once, and get caught. If your average speed = speed limit, you did the speed limit at least once, but it\u2019s not possible to tell if you exceeded it. Not enough evidence to suggest you oversped. If your average speed < speed limit, you might have exceeded the speed limit or equalled it, but did at least the average speed once in the trip. Not enough evidence to suggest you oversped. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of folks come to Quora to ask what the F is the use of mathematical concept G in real life. You\u2019ve seen those questions countless times. What is the use of limits in real life? What's the use of matrices in real life? What are the uses of a graph in real life? What is the usage of complex numbers in real life? Are math formulas ever used in real life? What is math topology used for in real life? What is the use of sets in real life? Where in real life will I use irrational numbers? You feel their pain. Why are we tortured with this? We are real people. We intend to live a real life. Why the hell do we need irrational numbers? Aren\u2019t they irrational? What do they have to do with real life? I don\u2019t answer a lot of these questions since they drive me into quiet desperation. But this one \u2026 derivatives. Where to start? Differential calculus was gradually discovered and developed by Archimedes, Aryabhata, Bh\u0101skara, Leibniz, Newton and who knows how many others for over 2,000 years. Without differentiation there\u2019s no understanding of mechanics, no electromagnetic theory, no optimization and control, no economics, quantum physics, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, cosmology, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, medical devices \u2026 nothing. I mean seriously, most of the things around you could never have been conceived without the fundamental notion of differentiation. One could lead a wonderful, earnest, honest, real life without differentiating anything, ever. Sure. One can also get through life without music, or without traveling, or without reading a single novel. But people who study the world through physics, or chemistry, or anything quantitative, and the people who design and engineer and invent and optimize, for the vast majority of those people differentiation is as essential as phones and pens. And the lives they lead, I assure you, are very real lives. ",
