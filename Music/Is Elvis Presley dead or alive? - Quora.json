            "answer_text": "Not having been personally in contact with evidence one way or another on the matter, while I consider that the legal reports may well be correct in asserting that Elvis Aaron Presley is passed in 1977, I wish that he was still alive. I also speak on the matter acknowledging that there is a sizeable contingent of the population that choose to dispute his passing, and so in discussions leave it as a matter still being disputed. There was a great line in the second season of The X-Files where Mulder comments on a medical doctor that summarily dismissed Mulder\u2019s explanation of Scully\u2019s symptoms as being due to alien abduction. \u201cI bet he is part of the 86% that actually think that Elvis is dead.\u201d I doubt that anyone will convince those who believe he lived past 1977, but enough evidence was given to believe that he had died.

            "answer_text": "\u201c Elvis is Alive \u201d- conspiracy theory  Music legend Elvis Presley died on 16 August 1977 - or did he? If the latest conspiracy theory is to be believed, the King of Rock and Roll faked his own death and now works as a groundsman in Graceland. Grainy footage of a bearded man has been posted on YouTube by \"The Shadow\", who claims the figure is an 81-year-old Elvis. In the caption for the video, which has been viewed nearly 700,000 times, The Shadow writes: \"He raises his 2 fingers to the top of his left head as a proof of life signal. In Chaldean Numerology the numerical value of V sign in Numerology is: 9. Proof of life!!!....he told us he is alive with the simple V sign. Number 9 ,'I'm Alive' He is giving us a clue that he knows we are all there watching him and to his most loyal fans that he is indeed with us.\" While some say the claims are \"idiotic\" and Elvis should be left to \"rest in peace\", the belief that the King is out there looks unlikely to fade away. It is among the remarkably resilient conspiracy theories of the past century. Here are ten more: Source : 'Elvis is alive' and ten more top conspiracy theories Thanks.. ",
