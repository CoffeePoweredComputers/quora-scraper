            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely but there's a catch. You can't share a file directly from your computer that you legally don't have the right to share like an illegal download or a legally bought file of David Bowie's last album for example. The law isn't enforced very well either way - you can see how it would be hard to regulate everyone who shared files illegally online. The general rule is, if you are sharing a link to a Youtube or Soundcloud page or any other site that broadcasts music and videos (illegal or not) then you are not breaking the law. Even if the site was illegally broadcasting, it's not you that's doing the wrong-doing, it's the site and you're not actually downloading. The problem occurs in downloading which is certainly illegal. You could get caught, especially if the site is already being monitored. Generally the more you download the more likely it is to get caught much like stealing in real life. If you steal 1 pack of biscuits from a store, they might not know until they encounter a problem with the numbers on the system. If you steal all the packets of biscuits from the aisle then they are going to notice that. So all-in-all, if you download, it's illegal but you probably won't get caught. If you share a download link, not technically illegal - not until you download.  ",
