            "answer_text": "What is the meaning of \"Running Up That Hill\" by Meg Myers? The meaning of Running up that hill by Kate Bush, who wrote it, is around gender and gender identification, specifically within a sexual relationship. The song is about the desire to swap gender with a partner and experience life through their eyes, mind and body. Kate has several themes she uses, mainly sex, sexual orientation, murder, ghosts, and the differences between men and women. In this song she\u2019s singing to a partner and discussing their roles within the relationship, including, although not exclusively, their roles within physical love. She is wondering what it would be like to swap bodies and allow them both to experience this. She is suggesting that she would like to make a supernatural deal to experience this, but typically of Bush, rather than make a deal with the devil like Faust, she wants to make a deal with God. Interestingly, the man in the video of Kate\u2019s version later came out as trans, which rather fits the theme. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that Kate Bush, the author of the lyrics, had in mind that she was singing to someone who was disabled and couldn\u2019t run up that hill. A normal human empathic response, to see someone you love suffering and unable to do what they used to. Just my thoughts, as someone who can\u2019t do what she used to do, the song has that meaning for me. ",
