            "answer_text": "I would recommend staying away from websites such as YouTube. Yes, it's free and there's a lot of advice that could be found on there but the quantity is vast and the quality is mostly very very poor. As good advice and quality education didn't come for free to any of us professionals, I'd recommend you spend a few dollars and turn your eye onto educational websites like Udemy and the sort. That's where you can get in touch with professionals and find decent advice and structured instructions. Most of these people are relatively young professionals who got some serious education on the topic, have been practicing their art for years but are open-minded enough to use the new technology and promote their skills through it. The beauty is that you can always read about the instructor themselves, maybe even watch some of their work through the preview videos and decide if you like them and that's your style of teaching before buying the course. The other thing is that you have it at your own convenience and can go back or repeat lessons as many times as you need to learn a certain technique or song. At the end, you can follow and evaluate your progress and either follow the same instructor or move on in search for better advice. In the case of learning violin, I'd recommend a course like this one for example - Learn To Play The Violin From Scratch. It gives you a very structured information on how each hand works, teaches you playing songs through multiple repetition with the instructor playing along, even note reading skills. The added bonus here is that you can contact the instructor himself by uploading a video of you playing and get his advice directly targeted on your own progress in addition to the general advice you get throughout the course. Reading through the bio of the instructor is also helpful and can tell you a lot about their qualifications as a teacher. As a professional myself, I'd definitely trust someone who had extensive education and earned a DMA (Doctorate in Music Arts) from a major conservatory to guide me in my learning progress as I know through my own experience how much work, time and practice it all is. These are some of the hints you should be looking for when choosing where and whom you learn from. Because the information is so vast out there, you should be as picky as a professional would be in their choice of which school, teacher or teaching style they pursue and follow. Unfortunately, to be done correctly, this involves a lot of digging, careful sorting and some money investment. But remember, it didn't come for free for usprofessionals either so take it as part of the process and don't rely on free but bad vs paid but quality advice. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Jagadish. In my humble opinion the violin is not an instrument you can learn online. There are YouTube videos by great masters including Yehudi Menuhin, but none of them are a substitute for a teacher. At least in the initial stages of learning, you absolutely need a teacher. Videos can show you what to do and how to do it. What a video cannot do, is to tell you whether you\u2019re doing it right, and if not, how to correct it. That\u2019s the difference between an online teaching system and a good teacher. ",
