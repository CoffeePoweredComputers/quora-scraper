            "answer_text": "It's a formatting error. Pretty much the only time you'd see two rows of chords is if the instrument is capoed and the original key plus the transposed chords are given- but this is usually indicated on the chart. Chord substitutions aren't usually shown on a chord chart- you'd have to know what the subs are or write them in yourself. Just from looking at the chords themselves it's highly unlikely that it means you can choose to use either chord since most of the notes would clash. In other words, two players playing the chart would have to choose the same chord or have problems. ",

If you play the whole song with the top chords only then play it again with the bottom chords, you\u2019ve just played two different songs. Or maintaining the metaphor - you\u2019ve just painted two entirely different pictures. I\u2019d definitely go with the bad word wrap. ",
