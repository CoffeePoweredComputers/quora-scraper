            "answer_text": "You cannot use someone else\u2019s content without permission. Doing so is illegal copyright infringement. That \u201c30 seconds\u201d thing comes from radio. With a standard broadcaster\u2019s license, allowing the playing of songs on the radio, the stations have to track all of the songs they play so that the can be charged at the end of the month for that air time. This license has an exception, though: playing less than 30 seconds of a song (typically behind the DJ talking) does not have to be recorded and paid for. They have permission to do that by this license. That 30 seconds thing is only for radio. And only for those paying their broadcaster\u2019s license fees. Not some standard that exists in fair use that applies to background music for videos. So no, you cannot use any music in an Instagram video; not without permission. What you want is royalty-free (or if you are really cheap, totally free) music for videos. That question is already on Quora: Where can I find royalty-free background music for inclusion in videos and short films? ",

            "answer_text": "By this if you mean you\u2019re wanting to post a video with particular music then I think you have to give copyright/credit to the people that the music belongs to. But if you mean that you want to use this music on an Instagram story I think it should be fine as it will tell who the artist is if you have added the music from the Instagram story features. Hope this was helpful! ",
