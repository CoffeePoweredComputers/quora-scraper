            "answer_text": "It\u2019s rather subjective - that being said, it really comes down to intervals. Some intervals play well together and some don\u2019t. (Almost literally based on how often their waves crest and trough together, this is called interference and may be worth checking out). For example: A perfect 5th is consonant and when played with a root makes a nice consonant chord. If you use a tritone with the root it\u2019s by and large more dissonant. So one thing to consider are the intervals involved. Now what makes it a bit more complicated is when you add more and more intervals to your chord\u2026 You have to consider their distance from the root, AND their distance from one another. For example, half steps are often considered more dissonant. You could play an \u2018A minor 7 9 chord\u2019 with this voicing : A B C E G this will be a crunchier voicing than spacing the B and C further apart. A C E G B Now we have nice spaced out thirds from one another instead of a half step (or minor 2nd)between the B and the C. This may sound better or not to people, but the literal interference between the half step is audible, especially in lower ranges. This is one example of how the perceived dissonance of a chord is affected by all intervals involved. Tldr: If you\u2019re a beginner, here\u2019s my list of scary intervals: minor 2nd, tritone, minor 6th. Make a chord and put a bunch of these intervals in it. It will be dissonant (to most people) Also I should add that context helps as well, a passing diminished chord probably sounds wayyy sweeter than a 32bar diminished chord ; ) ",

            "answer_text": "Chords are composed of pitch intervals, three or more. Pitch intervals are composed of notes that vibrate at specific frequencies. Because notes vibrate in the medium of transmission, usually air, they can interact. That interaction is called consonant or dissonant depending on how much of the energy of the two \u201cparent\u201d vibrations goes into the \u201coffspring\u201d vibration. The less energy, the more consonant; the more energy the more dissonant. As each pitch interval of any chord produces this third \u201coffspring\u201d vibration (except the tonic - octave interval which produces no third vibration at all and is perfectly consonant) they all interact. The multiple interactions are what produce a set of vibrations which can be judged consonant or dissonant. There are two aspects to consonance and dissonance; objective and subjective. The objective aspect is that every pitch interval produces a definite amount of dissonance, from zero (tonic - octave or Do-Do) to a lot (staying with the western equal temperament scale of 12 semitones) that would be the tonic - augmented 4th interval, sometimes referred to as the tritone. This phenomenon can be seen as a graphic display on an oscilloscope and has nothing to do with whether a given person enjoys or is repulsed by a given chord. The subjective aspect is what a person likes when it comes to consonance and dissonance. When I was young, I delighted in consonant intervals and detested dissonance; now I prefer a judicious blend of both as relentless consonance is boring and relentless dissonance is irritating. ",

            "answer_text": "Not an easy thing to answer. It\u2019s really cultural. In western music assonance is based upon the basic triad although people are now accepting of more complex chords. There are those who will give you mathematical explainations but on the whole it\u2019s a matter of what sounds good to YOUR ear. Music of other cultures will often sound very strange to us but containing great sensitivity and emotion to those of that tradition.. ",

This is a result of two or more tones that are a half or whole step apart, or that are the inversion of those intervals, major and minor sevenths. Any diminished or augmented intervals within a chord also causes dissonance. ",
