            "answer_text": "What could be more similar to \u201cGlory Box\u201d than a song that basically uses the same chord sequence? It sounds the same to me, at least, but I\u2019m a drummer, what do I know about chord sequences? Anyway, here\u2019s Sylvia Howard with \u201cI Wanna Go Somewhere (Close Ur Eyes)\u201d from the soundtrack of Ni pour, ni contre (bien au contraire) (2003) by C\u00e9dric Klapisch. (Mediocre film, though, rather watch his Auberge espagnole trilogy instead.)  Sylvia Howard: \u201cI Wanna Go Somewhere (Close Ur Eyes)\u201d (2003)  If that wasn\u2019t obscure enough, I\u2019ve got something even rarer for you. Hipkiss (not to be confused with Stanley Ipkiss from The Mask) with \u201cLove You\u2019re in\u201d from their album debut Bluebird (1997), i.e. around the time that Portishead\u2019s eponymous and unwieldy second album came out. (I had trouble getting my head and heart around that one, let me tell you, but now I love it.) Be that as it may, Hipkiss are the smooth jazzy voice of Catherine Mather and the programming by Andy Campbell \u2014 whose guitar work sounds very much like Portishead\u2019s Adrian Utley.  Hipkiss: \u201cLove You\u2019re in\u201d (1997)  Finally, to answer the opening question of what could be more similar to \u201cGlory Box\u201d: why, \u201cGlory Box\u201d itself, of course \u2014 but covered by none other than the late, great folk icon John Martyn from his covers album The Church with One Bell (1998). Now, before you press play, I must warn you. This version \u2014 where he even cleverly changes the lyrics to tell a male perspective \u2014 is so beautiful that you will want to kill yourself afterwards, for nothing else in your life can possibly begin to match this. Ever. You have been warned.  John Martyn: \u201cGlory Box\u201d (1998) ",

The Portishead version is itself flipped by 18 year-old Ontario singer-songwriter Alessia Cara on \u2018Here\u2019 (although it interpolates the original\u2019s intro), basically an opportunity for Cara to show off her vocal style and establish herself on the side of the anti-social introverted teen who doesn\u2019t like parties. Alessia Cara has been doing covers on Youtube, as is the now well-worn path. She signed to Def Jam earlier this year and \u2018Here\u2019, produced by Pop & Oak provides an augmented and impressive intro to what is to come Alessia Cara - Here (Lyric Video) source: http://nialler9.com/alessia-cara-flips-portisheads-glory-box/ ",
