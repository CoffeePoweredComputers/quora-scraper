            "answer_text": "The NUX JTC Drum & Loop Pro will get your job done. It offers 6 hours of recording time, 256 loop track memories, has tap-tempo control, and records at 24-bit/44.1 kHz. However, it's ain't a multi-track looper, and it doesn't have reverse playback mode. Too bad DigiTech discontinued the JML2 JamMan Stereo looper. In India that pedal used to cost almost same as the JTC. Although it too wasn't a multi-track looper but it still had nice features like dedicated footswitches to scroll the loop tracks, reverse playback mode, stereo input and output, microphone input, expandable storage, and dry signal defeat. Not to forget it was built like an effing tank. ",
