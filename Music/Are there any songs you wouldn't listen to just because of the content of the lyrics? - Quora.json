You can choose to listen to such music of profanity. Such is your choice that I respect. Conversely, I ask that you respect my choice to listen to music that you may not prefer. I know that Rap also contains profanity and themes of sexual violence of all kinds, also engendering hatred of the police. I do not desire nor do I have the time to scrutinize every Rap or Heavy Metal song. My criteria in listening to any type of music is whether Jehovah God and His Beloved Son Christ Jesus would want to \u201csit down with me\" and listen to and approve of the songs I like. My closing remarks is from is from 1 Corinthian 10:31, \u201cTherefore, whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else (like listening to music), do all things for God's glory.\u201d Mahalo me ke aloha pumehana.

Any tunes featuring gratuitous violence & profanity especially. Misogynistic lyrics also. Political messages & preaching is a big no-no too. Actually, most of the music I listen to is either instrumental or predates a lot of the really nasty stuff lyrically that\u2019s out there today. ",
