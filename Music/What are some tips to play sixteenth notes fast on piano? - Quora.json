            "answer_text": "a. Write in fingering of each and every note so that the passage fits YOUR hand, and not somebody else\u2019s. Printed fingering in the score usually works, but not always. Use a pencil and an eraser, because you may want to change the fingering as you progress! b. Play VERY slowly at first, relaxing all tension as soon as each not begins to sound. Any effort needed to produce sound must be of very short duration, relaxation between notes as long as possible. Then gradually increase the speed (a lot of discipline needed with this approach!) c. Watch how you use the thumb - the thumb is essential in changing the position of the hand going up or down the keys. Here is where unnecessary movements and unnecessary tension are generated. d. Evenness in the sixteenth-notes - check with the metronome at ANY speed. e. The duration of each note + how it ends + and how it is connected to the next note. Ideally it should be the same for each. This probably is the one factor that distinguishes the good pianist and the good musician -it is very hard to monitor four or more notes per second. Hence, practice SLOWLY until you develop an automatic \u201cear\u201d for scrutinizing each note for its entire duration, AND any tiny separation between it and the next note. The brain is too slow to analyze - it has to be by autonomic means [reflex action]. Listen to CD\u2019s or DVD\u2019s by great performers - all the best ones have mastered this riddle. The other pianists sound SLOPPY or SAPPY even if they get everything else right! f. If you are referring to fast 16th-notes in Mozart, remember that the pianos of his day had narrower keys, an incredibly light action, and pedal was used either never or very sparingly for special effects. The pianist\u2019s fingers had to do everything at a much lesser volume. But the sound carried, even when playing with an orchestra. The modern play is sluggish and slow in comparison, and has lost the bright color of the sound. Mozart said: \u201cthe music must flow like oil\u201d, presumably referring to the finely-chiseled perfection of fast passages. ",

            "answer_text": "There are no tricks to playing fast other than playing properly. If your teacher tells you you have to practice more or play it a thousand times, you need a new teacher. Practicing improperly is counterproductive. Practice doesn\u2019t make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect. There are three things that get in the way of a pianist from playing fast: not having the correct movements, playing incorrect movements (not the same thing) and having a teacher who doesn\u2019t know what they are doing (which is most). \u201cPractice more\u201d doesn\u2019t solve a problem when the student just needs a subtle adjustment to their hand or arm or elbow or back. Without that knowledge you re just wasting time with that teacher. One can\u2019t force speed into their hands. It is already there, it just needs to be unleashed. Proper movement comes from the elbow and the forearm playing the keys with gravity, rotation, forward shifting, shaping, moving in and out, and all the fingers moving in the same direction at the same time. Improper movement is isolating a finger, trying to play from the fingers, using two muscles at the same time to move one bone in two directions at the same time (like flexing and abducting), crossing the thumb under the palm, stretching, twisting the wrist, sitting too high or too low, etcetera. Ask your teacher where the pronator teres is and how it is used in playing or, the thumbs abductor and how not to use it. If they don\u2019t know the answer, you may as well have them give you quantum physics lessons, too for they are just as qualified. ",
