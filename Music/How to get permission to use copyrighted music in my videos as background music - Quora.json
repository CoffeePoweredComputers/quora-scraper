            "answer_text": "One really easy way to do this is to make use of YouTube\u2019s music library. YouTube There is a ton of free music there. You can additionally check the policies of other music to see if you can use it - much of the music on YouTube can be used in your video, but will then be monetized by the rights owner: YouTube Unfortunately, for use outside of YouTube, you will need to do clearance with the individual rights holder for use of their music - it is not as simple a process as some other types of music licensing: How To Acquire Music For Films -Mark ",

            "answer_text": "The Audio Library in You Tube is absolutely terrible, but if you want sound affects, well by all means go ahead. No matter what kind of music you are looking for in the \u2018audio library\u2019, every song is instrumental and there is practically no range or change in the music itself (monotonous). In the past, when I was searching for music in there, I could not find a descent one. For me, I kept hoping to find \u2018good songs\u2019 with singers performing, but to my great disappointment\u2026 none. This would make a great difference to the music in the Audio Library by having singers and/or groups in the music pieces. If you don\u2019t want to lose your subscribers by using boring pieces of \u2018strictly\u2019 instrumental songs repeating the same range over and over in the song, then don\u2019t bother going in there.
