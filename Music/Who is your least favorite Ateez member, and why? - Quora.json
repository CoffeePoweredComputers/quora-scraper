I already have bad eyesight. Now I\u2019m going to go blind.He looks better than me with blonde hair. I\u2019m a natural blonde, yet he still looks better than me.He\u2019s always making the other idols envy him. Yes Jongho, we know you are one of the best vocalists in the industry. You didn\u2019t have to show off at MAMA.He\u2019s stealing my spotlight. I used to be the special one for being left-handed, but Jongho had to come in and steal it. IT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH. It\u2019s not like he couldn\u2019t choose to be left-handed.He always makes fun of me. He\u2019s over here breaking watermelons with his strength and I can\u2019t even carry one without struggling.This man deserves to be in jail. Just look at that disgusting smile he gives.  In case you couldn\u2019t tell, Jongho is one of my favorite artists in the whole industry. Why can\u2019t any of the boys in my school be like him? ",
