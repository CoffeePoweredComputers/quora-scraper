And they have a ton of free samples too.  Hope this helps some. Just keep your chin up and don't ever stop looking. Try everything that even sounds interesting. I recommend ignoring the ui, because there are some amazing vsts that have shitty, if not nonexistent UIs. Half the fun is exploring the sonic capabilities off each and everyone individually, seeing what you can accomplish. ",
