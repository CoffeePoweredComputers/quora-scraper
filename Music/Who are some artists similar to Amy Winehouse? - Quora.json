            "answer_text": "Lana Del Rey  I am listening to Amy since 2007 when I was in college and when she died, I inclined to the music similar to Amy. Now I think I have found at least two singers who I can relate to. Same agony, surreal music which Amy used to produce in lyrics and melody. Lana Del Rey, Paloma Faith. Even I can relate Lana and Amy in terms of the upbringing and Alcohol addiction. Paloma has produced only few songs but she has the same stuff, pain, sadness, Gloominess. Hope this would help. ",
