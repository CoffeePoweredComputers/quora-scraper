Itzy straight up debuted famous, with their catchy bop single \u2018DALLA DALLA\u2019 so they were basically born with a silver spoon. They were always prioritized by JYP, not just them but TWICE too, but TWICE worked up their fame unlike ITZY who got benefited a lot by debuting into one of the big four. The members are very millennial and this type of snobby attitude is not to my liking. ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously Blackpink, and Itzy for second, Blackpink debuted in 2016, but they got it on the top faster than any girl groups debuted before them, because the marketing was always a boostup comparing to other groups, plus have their :extra-show-off image which is absolutely annoying, and if you have instagram, you'll see Blackpink and itzy members are not following anyone, but look at the other group members, let's say AoA or Oh My Girl, you'll see they have a huge list on following, too much proud to be that famous, ain't they?
