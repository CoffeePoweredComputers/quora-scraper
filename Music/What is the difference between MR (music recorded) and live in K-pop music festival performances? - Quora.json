            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019m not an expert on that so correct me please if I\u2019m wrong. MR or Music Recorded is basically the same thing as a karaoke. So, it\u2019s the instrumental. But, generally, MR are not just the instrumental, there is some sounds of the voices of the singers in the background, to make them look better on stage. But, when you are live, it\u2019s that you are actually singing. There is no sounds of your voice in the background. So yes, there is the instrumental, but it\u2019s the actual voice of the singers. So if you listen to a K-pop group in MR, you don\u2019t really know how they sound (it\u2019s why MR Removed exists). But when you listen to a live performance, it\u2019s the real voices of the idols. ",
