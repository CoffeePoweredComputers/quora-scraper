            "answer_text": "I'm guessing that you mean that you want to PLAY classical music; because if you want to learn all ABOUT classical music, there are various classical music guides with recommended listening. My main instrument is piano, and there is a vast literature of wonderful music for this instrument in its own right.  A further advantage in learning piano is that it is capable of making a reasonable representation of music conceived for other mediums - be it orchestral or another medium. The 19th century pianist/composer Franz Liszt believed that it was possible to transcribe ANY music for piano, and he brilliantly proved his point in his own extraordinarily adept arrangements of other composers' works for that instrument. IN other words, learning piano will bring you into contact with all kinds of classical music potentially, so you will need to buy a piano (more on that in a mo.), and get yourself a good teacher.  A good teacher, isn't simply a qualified one, but a person who comes recommended and that you feel that you can relate to.  A start may be your local music shop, or if you don't have one, find out about visiting piano teachers in a nearby school/college. As to the piano:  here you need to be careful, because if you are looking for a cheap option, you MIGHT be Ok, but on the other hand it may be some clapped out affair that hasn't been tuned for yonks. You can either go \"digital\", or buy a piano on some kind of HP arrangement.  Digital is an option many choose today, but be aware that despite  pros such as 1)never needs tuning 2) has many other facilities; the cons are 1) has a much shorter life expectancy than an acoustic piano 2) The touch (though it can be adjusted) ISN'T quite the same, and lacks the same DEGREE of touch-sensitivity as an acoustic piano 3) a good acoustic piano will always have more \"ambience\" and resonance.   That said however, the digital versions are far more portable and convenient! Moreover, any second hand acoustic piano needs to be checked out by someone who knows what they are talking about -  particularly a person who can tell you whether or not it is at pitch. Good luck!

            "answer_text": "A2A  I am just a classical music DJ and not an actual music professional, so someone else might be able to help you better with this Any way, I think that's really depend on what you are intended to do with your classical music expertise that you wish to have. If you want to be a professional musician, 23 is way too late (although not entirely impossible as for example this guy   had managed to make himself a professional musician and award-winning on top of that while being entirely self-taught and did it very late in his life) and I can't offer you anything more than \"read the note for as soon as possible, and practice like your life depends on it - it does!\" However if you are like me at want to know music theory just to enjoy the music or be able to say something about it, the best way to do that is to start listening to as many great pieces as possible (the basic one like Beethoven 9 symphonies, some of Mozart best, Brahms 4 symphonies, Chopin etc.) it is actually best if you don't pay too much attention to it and just let it runs as some sort of background while you work.  Classical music is like many of the little instrumental songs that are packed together in one single movement (and a piece usually contain at least 3 movements) so it can be very overwhelming for the beginner to pay attention to all of that melodies from the start, by letting it run as some sort of background, you can just note whatever melody you like and remember that it what you like about that pieces.  Then after you gain some familiarity with it you can listen to it more in detail, you will be very tiring at first but it is a very rewarding experience! once you fully follow what the composer would like to tell you with all that notes, it can be very awe inspiring.  Or alternatively, a rather fun way of doing it is to listen to some of the very best performance and compare it with the award-winning version of the same pieces. This usually tell a whole lot about how good music is suppose to sound (believe me, you will definitely be able to tell) and actually quite a good start if you want to do some music critique.  Age definitely doesn't matter at all at this stage, you just need a passion and effort to learn - the same can apply to almost everything in this universe. ",
