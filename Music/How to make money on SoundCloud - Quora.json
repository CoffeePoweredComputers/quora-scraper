            "answer_text": "Artists wanting to make money directly off SoundCloud, however, have had few options. It had been working great as a way to gain exposure, but it wasn\u2019t until they added the On SoundCloud monetization option that artists could make money off their creations. I\u2019m going to help you understand how you can make money on SoundCloud, and show you a few promotion ideas to get you going. The On SoundCloud partner program is quite similar to YouTube\u2019s Partner Program. Artists are paid when users view or listen to ads while enjoying the music the artists upload. The general idea is that artists are paid for each ad that plays during one of their tracks in the same manner as YouTube\u2019s Partner Program shares revenue.  The tiers of the On SoundCloud program As with everything online, a few tiers of service have been created. Each one offers bands different services, has different costs associated with it, but only one will get you paid for your music: 1, Partner: This free account is for beginners. There is no monetization option. What you get is: 3 hours of free uploads of your tracksBasic stats to start growing your followingThe ability to join their Insider group for free tipsThere\u2019s no money to be made here directly, but you can work on getting your tracks heard and your name out there. 2, Pro/Pro Unlimited: There is only one difference between Pro, and Pro Unlimited. The Pro Unlimited offers you an unlimited amount of uploads, while Pro offers 6 hours. The similarities are: The ability to showcase your 5 best tracks by pinning them to the top of your listingGeo-based statistics to see where your fans areSocial statistics to see which platforms are being used to embed your tracksThe other difference is, you guessed it, the cost. Pro costs \u00a33.99/month or \u00a335/year. Pro Unlimited, with unlimited track upload space, costs \u00a38/month or \u00a375/year. 3, Premier: This has all of the features of Pro Unlimited, plus a little more: An account manager who will help you make your account even betterExclusive music promotion opportunities for your music and profileThe ability to make money on your SoundCloud musicBesides, before making money on SoundCloud, your account need get the huge exposure.

            "answer_text": " SoundCloud has always been a distinct outlier in the online streaming music industry. What has set them apart is how they allow anyone to upload and stream music without any annoying ads or monthly fees. For the past six years, SoundCloud has continued to thrive, even in a market dominated by competitors. However, despite their success, the company has shifted gears and recently launched their new creator partner program, called On SoundCloud. Similar to YouTube\u2019s Partner Program, the new service will allow artists to monetize the content they upload to SoundCloud through paid advertisements. The paid ads will appear on either the SoundCloud player or within a streaming audio file. When the program was first introduced, there were no specific terms to outline how exactly the revenue sharing would work. But from what I\u2019ve read, it sounds like the artist will be compensated for each time an ad appears on any track they uploaded. One thing I really like about SoundCloud\u2019s platform is that since the company has always been an artist-centered community, we can expect that the revenue generated will support the artists and not just the brands and publishers paying for the ads. Another cool feature is that SoundCloud offers a tiered services structure, so each accountholder can subscribe for the specific features they want. Here is a breakdown of each service tier they offer: Partner \u2013 This tier is free, but it only allows you to upload 3 hours of content. It also comes with online support and basic reporting and statistics (play counts, likes, comments and downloads). Pro \u2013 This tier will cost you $6 per month (or $55 annually) and you\u2019re upload limit is bumped up to 6 hours of content. The Pro tier allows you to enable Quiet Mode, which allows you to manage comments and stats for your tracks. This tier also lets artists \u201cSpotlight\u201d their best work, by pinning your top track(s) and playlist(s) to the top of your profile. Pro Unlimited \u2013 This tier gives artists unlimited uploads \u2013 hence the name \u2013 and it costs $15 per month (or $135 annually). In addition to all of the aforementioned features, you also get some advanced analytics perks. With Pro Unlimited, you can see who\u2019s playing/downloading your tracks, which countries/states/cities you\u2019re most popular and which social networks are providing the most traffic or engagement. (Note: If you use a Partner, Pro or Pro Unlimited account, no audio ads will be placed on your tracks and you are not eligible for revenue sharing.) Premier \u2013 The premier level is available by invite only and this is the tier where artists can start making money from the tracks they upload. If you didn\u2019t receive an invite from SoundCloud yet, fear not. SoundCloud has hand-selected a small group of artists or \u201ccreators\u201d to participate in the initial rollout. Eventually \u2013 hopefully sooner than later \u2013 SoundCloud intends to fully rollout the new ad format, making it available to all account holders. In addition to limiting the pool of artists, SoundCloud has also limited the number of brands that will be participating in the first run of advertisements. Some of these companies include Red Bull, Jaguar and Comedy Central. Some of the initial content partners include Sony/ATV, BMG, Funny or Die and Washington hip-hop artist Goldlink. It will be interesting to see where this all leads. I\u2019m sure there will be plenty of users that aren\u2019t happy with the ads. But at the same time, I think SoundCloud has made it abundantly clear that it\u2019s a service for artists \u2013 not consumers. So as long as they keep that same ideology, they shouldn\u2019t have too much resistance from users. In the meantime, I heard rumors that SoundCloud accountholders can actually apply for an invitation. I haven\u2019t been able to verify this, but I would imagine it\u2019s only a matter of time. ",
