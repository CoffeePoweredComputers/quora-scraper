            "answer_text": "Here I go\u2026 these are my opinions and they aren\u2019t \u201cnot good\u201d they just are overrated.  Fancy was good the first listen or so but after like 3 I couldn\u2019t listen to it and took it out of my playlist. For me it\u2019s one of twices worst songs. Feel special was amazing and my favorite song by them and I think it deserves the hype fancy got. I think fancy just got hype because it\u2019s different then their other songs.  this is a confusing post because I actually really like the song and listen to it often but in my opinion it\u2019s not the best red velvet songs. I like bad boy or red flavor better. This is just my opinion but i hear a lot of people say this would be their best song if they got better promotions and I disagree.  I love Dalla Dalla and wannabe they are probably in my top 10 favorite songs. But i thought icy was the debut song for some time because most groups make better songs as they go. By wannabe was amazing so I feel like they learned their lesson. Okay now I\u2019m going to name songs that I think deserve the hype  The dance break, the chorus, the choreography, the rap. Everything was perfect. This was probably the best song in my opinion to happen to kpop. It\u2019s iconic. The way they jumped from as if it\u2019s your last to this blows my mind. I feel like is deserved to be the first kpop group song to reach 1 billion views.  this is by far twices best song. It didn\u2019t get hate fro a reason. The girls looked amazing, their outfits looked amazing, dahyuns rap was iconic, and just every thing about it was perfect.  Wannabe by itzy was amazing. It did take a listen or two to like but I loved it so much. It\u2019s in my top 5 favorite songs. I love the message but I hate that they are getting a large amount of hate for their visuals, vocals, to different concept when the whole point of their music is that they don\u2019t care what people say and they are different.  I introduced my friend in America to kpop and she wasn\u2019t really interested but she said she did like kill this love. I never got the hate around this song. It\u2019s similar yes, but kpop groups shouldn\u2019t get hate for having similar songs. Especially since This was only their second song after a completely different concept (as if it\u2019s your last).  I don\u2019t even stan momoland but I love this song. It\u2019s amazing. The vocals in it kill me every time and the chorus/ choreography is addicting. ",

            "answer_text": "Just because I don\u2019t like them, doesn\u2019t mean they are bad. Just because I dislike a part, find it annoying or just hated it doesn\u2019t mean it is that, it\u2019s just what it sounded like to me. Fancy - Twice I\u2019m not a big fan of Twice\u2019s music, but I really didn\u2019t like Fancy. The chorus annoys me and I think Feel Special is better. My favourite song of Twice is Breakthrough. But Fancy\u2019s choreography is great. Bon Bon Chocalat - Everglow It was meh. I remember everyone was hyping their debut up and I thought it was just okay but I just don\u2019t like it now. I think the chorus isn\u2019t as good as everyone says it is. Adios - Everglow I enjoy some heavier songs but I did not like this one. It was loud, the rap kinda annoyed me and I also wasn\u2019t a fan of the choreography. Hit - Seventeen I did not like Home, I thought it was my least favourite song of Seventeen. That changed when Hit came. It\u2019s so loud and sounds a bit more like noise to me. Loved Fear though. Dalla Dalla - ITZY It got mixed reactions but then everyone started liking it and I don\u2019t; It\u2019s too annoying to me. I also wasn\u2019t a fan of the MV. Didn\u2019t get the hype of their debut. Icy - ITZY Like it better then Dalla Dalla but I still don\u2019t like it. Wasn\u2019t a big fan of the choreography either. I was kinda disappointed with female rookie groups in 2019 to be honest. I didn\u2019t like any specific female rookies and I\u2019ve listened to a lot. Wave - ATEEZ Not a fan of ATEEZ\u2019s music in general. But I disliked this song more then the others. Kinda found the song boring. Treasure - ATEEZ Lots of people were hyping their debut but I didn\u2019t like it. Pirate King has grown on me and I\u2019m obsessed with Hongjoong\u2019s verse but I did not like Treasure at all. Humph! - Pentagon Not that popular but still. I love Pentagon but since Shine their songs have been a hit or miss for me. I didn\u2019t like Naughty Boy but I loved Cosmo and Sha La La. But I really didn\u2019t like Humph! As If It\u2019s Your Last - Blackpink I like all their songs except this one. Too cute, didn\u2019t like Lisa\u2019a rap. Didn\u2019t like Jisoo\u2019s curled hair with the hair clip. Didn\u2019t like Lisa\u2019s \u201c\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\ucc98\ub7fc \ub9c8-\ub9c8-\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\ucc98\ub7fc\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ubc24\uc778 \uac83\ucc98\ub7fc love\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\ucc98\ub7fc \ub9c8-\ub9c8-\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\ucc98\ub7fc\ub0b4\uc77c \ub530\uc708 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\ucc98\ub7fc\u201d La Vie en Rose - IZ*ONE It isn\u2019t that bad but not a fan. Much preferred Violeta. Chorus kinda felt empty and felt boring. Roller Coaster - Chungha Voice kinda felt annoying in this song. Didn\u2019t like the pink outfit. Didn\u2019t like Chungha\u2019s short hair, probably a wig but still. Just kinda annoying in general. Birthday - Somi Felt like a mess. Sometimes too cute. Random beat drop I didn\u2019t like. Didn\u2019t like the rap part. I know it\u2019s supposed to be sassy but I didn\u2019t like the \u201cOops you\u2019re not invited\u201d part. Felt like she was a mean girl and sounded too cocky for my liking. I know it\u2019s supposed to be that way. Siren - Sunmi Thought it was empty and I just don\u2019t like it. Love Gashina though and Heroine is growing on me. Everyday - Winner Hated it. The autotune was too much. One of the worst K-Pop songs for me. Millions - Winner Boring, too slow. Ah Yeah - Winner Same as Millions. Boogie Up - WJSN It's not that popular, but I don't like it. It just annoys me so much. Soso - Winner Sorry for the amount of Winner songs in this, I just haven't liked anything from them since 2018. Anyway, thought the song was boring and annoying. ",
