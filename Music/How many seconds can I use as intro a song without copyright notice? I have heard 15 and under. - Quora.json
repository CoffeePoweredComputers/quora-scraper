            "answer_text": "I think you have mis-read the answers by Cliff Gilley and Jonathan Tobin. That are not saying that you are not allowed to use the clip or the quote. They are saying that when it is brought into court, the judge has to look at all of the factors to come to a fair decision about whether your use is ripping off the song writer. The fair decision can't be based on some exact metric like \"22 seconds of a song, no more!\". Songs come in different lengths and there are many other factors that make a fixed time unit meaningless. What you seem to want is a guarantee on your legal issue. I hope you are aware that the only person that can make such assurances is your paid lawyer. The law actually prohibits the general public from offer specific advice on what to do. We can broadly comment, but not recommend to you a course of action.  In my opinion as a non-lawyer, you're screwed. The project you are working on is not a parody, a comment on the original song, and not an academic/educational project. A \"promotional video\" falls squarely in the definition of \"commercial use\" since that term includes advertising (even for a nonpartisan grassroot nonprofit project; it's still advertising). So the bigger test for this use, \"the purpose and character of your use\", is not ranking highly before we even get to \"the amount and substantiality of the portion taken\". And on \"amount and substantiality of the portion taken\", the main chorus of the song is pretty substantial. This is probably why using song samples (\"sampling\") was ruled a copyright infringement decades ago, forcing NWA to fork over a huge penalty for using samples in their songs from other song's choruses. There are also no good workarounds. A clip of your friend performing it is twice as much copyright infringement, not a workaround. The source of the music/lyrics you add to your video are not important, the case will only rely on whether or not the copyrighted material is present. But my opinion is no guarantee that you would lose; or more importantly, that the copyright holder would even bother to sue you in the first place. Are you aware that the only likely penalty is that you have to stop playing the video? If it goes to court, there might be other penalties, like court fees and so on, but the likelihood of this going to court without a warning from their lawyer first is something you should consider.

            "answer_text": "What you\u2019ve \u201cheard\u201d is a myth. It is only loosely and tangentially related to the \u201camount & substantiality\u201d test which is one of four factors used to determine whether a use falls under \u201cfair use.\u201d But this only comes into play as a legal defense when you\u2019re sued for copyright infringement, so the only way you\u2019ll know for sure whether that use was indeed considered fair is to be sued and have a federal copyright judge rule on it (in most cases with the attorneys for the music you infringed making their case that the use wasn\u2019t fair). Also, that defense is only relevant when the use was for purposes of research, teaching, criticism, commentary, or news reporting (those are transformative uses which have been recognized as exceptions where fair use applies).[1] Note the all-important words \u201cfor purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research\u201d from \u00a7 107 of Title 17 USC.[2] It is not a carte blanche, but is limited to those purposes. So if you\u2019re preparing a lesson which provides teaching or scholarship on that genre or style, it\u2019s likely to fall under the exception of fair use; if you\u2019re creating a piece that comments on or criticizes the artist or genre or provides transformative educational or critical/commentary value, sure, that\u2019s more likely to fall within fair use. If you\u2019re creating a satirical or parodic piece, there\u2019s more latitude under later case law recognitions. But deciding to include a segment, opener, riff, melodic theme, etc. in your own work simply because you like it doesn\u2019t count (there\u2019s no excepted purpose there no matter how transformative your work was), so it cannot be reasonably considered fair use. See 17 U.S. Code \u00a7 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use. Also, there are other elements from those four factors which matter immensely, such as how recognizable that audio segment is (effect of the use upon the potential market), how significantly that clip plays into the original work as a whole (was it a minor unrelated theme or a significant riff that establishes the tone and style of the piece), how much that segment is in proportion to the whole - a 5-second clip from a 15 second theme of a chorus or opening riff is far more infringing than a 20-sec segment from an obscure and non-repeating verse (substantiality), and how significantly it factors into your re-work (potential for market confusion or dilution). For more on this, see the \u201cde minimis\u201d discussion in Measuring Fair Use: The Four Factors. Also, it would be wise to read up on some of the excellent summaries of famous music plagiarism cases involving sampling of identifiable riffs and segments: Famous Copyright Infringement Plagiarism cases in Music and Songs on Trial: 12 Landmark Music Copyright Cases. In the vast majority of those cases, huge sums of money, lots of negative publicity, and months (if not years) of litigation were involved, and only in a few cases were the uses and reappropriations of other songs\u2019 melodies and riffs vindicated. So unless you\u2019re famous and have lawyers and lots of money at your disposal, it\u2019s best to steer clear of any chance of being accused of infringement.
