Queen is one of the British bands that formed in London in 1970, with the classic line-up of Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon and the legendary vocalist Freddie Mercury. Following their 1977 album News of the World, which contained well-known songs \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d and \u201cWe Are the Champions,\u201d Queen quickly became one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world by the early 1980s.

            "answer_text": "My top ten, taking popularity, influence, fame, and, most of all, personal preference into account: The Beatles. Not actually my favourite band, but it would be churlish not to acknowledge that they are the biggest band of all time, from anywhere. 1960s.Led Zeppelin. If it was a list of rock bands, they would come top. 1970s (mainly)Pink Floyd. A slow burner, but so influential. 1960s-present.Queen. Did very well out of Bohemian Rhapsody, and perhaps more popular now than they were in their heyday. 1970s-1980s.Dire Straits. It\u2019s fashionable to mock them now, but they were the big attraction at Live Aid. 1980s mainly.The Police. So much raw energy, so much potential, so much left undone. 1980s mainly.Black Sabbath. Not one of my big listens, but extremely influential. 1970s to presentFlorence and the Machine. Easily my pick out of bands currently producing new material. 2000s to presentRadiohead. Extremely popular choice, if not my choice. 1980s to present.The Who. Their music has come back into focus again. 1960s and 1970s mainly.The Rolling Stones are mainly known for being the Rolling Stones, but don\u2019t get a lot of listening these days. The Sex Pistols are widely (and incorrectly) known for inventing punk, but the Ramones from the USA got there first. Blondie is really a US band that made it in the UK. U2 are UK but not British, and would otherwise belong in the top five. The Clash are mainly known for that one album cover, and London Calling, but would pip the Sex Pistols for punk in my book. The Jam could feature too, as might The Specials. Genesis and Fleetwood Mac would be in there if it was just my personal preference. Fleetwood Mac probably belong there instead of number 7, but they are mainly a Californian band now. Deep Purple are ever green (or ever purple), and could vie for a spot easily, but then the list starts being 1960s-1970s focussed. ELO would then be in for consideration, as would Status Quo. At that point Mot\u00f6rhead would be knocking on the door, as would Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, which was formed in the UK, even if Hendrix was US. Then we have all kinds of bands like Duran Duran, the Smiths, the House Martins, the Beautiful South, Echo and the Bunnymen, New Model Army, the Stranglers, which never quite made it onto my playlists, but are much loved. Britain has been good for bands. ",
