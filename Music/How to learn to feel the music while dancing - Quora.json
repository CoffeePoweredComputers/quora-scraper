            "answer_text": "There is no wrong way to \u201cfeel\u201d the music while dancing. Let yourself look foolish and silly! The more you analyze and edit yourself, the more you stay in your head and not in your body. Feeling is all in the body and the heart, not the mind. Listening to the song multiple times helps. One thing that really helps is to focus on a particular instrument in the music. The bass-guitar is usually an incredible choice because it grounds everything while still having a melodic sway. Learn to first identify and isolate one particular instrument, and then explore it! How does it move in the music? Is it aggressive or soft? Does it bounce or flow? These ideas all help. Thematic ideas help too - what are the lyrics of the song about? Maybe you can use the lyrics as a springboard to tell your own unique story. Good luck on your dance and music adventure! Remember. Dance like nobody\u2019s watching because nobody is. And if they are watching. Great, you\u2019ve got a few fans! Give yourself permission to be silly, and you\u2019ll feel the music in no time :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about dancing a dance routine, then this is my advice. Many don\u2019t realize how much mental concentration it takes to do everything correctly when you dance a routine. You have to enjoy yourself while staying with the music, while watching and correcting yourself, while remembering every step, while remembering your teacher\u2019s critique and changes, while putting emotion into it, and ,if you are in a group, while staying in time with the other dancers and not bumping into them. Feeling the music is something you almost have to concentrate on once you have your dance down, but once you\u2019ve got it down, it can be easier to really feel it. Multitasking, I mean it is useful, but it sure is tough. It may help if you do the routine or combination over and over again while focusing more on the feeling than the moves, then bring the moves more forcefully into the equation, but keeping up the emotion and feeling.
