            "answer_text": "I love all of her lyrics. I know this sounds a bit cringe and stuff but she music helped me a lot in 2019. I\u2019m not a fan of her newer releases but I still listen to her albums when I\u2019m doing homework or feeling sad. We all get a bit depressed when something bad happens to us. Something happened in October which really made me upset and I was crying the whole night. Music helps me calm down so I went on Spotify and played my playlist. \u201cWish you were gay\u201d came up and I was reading the little thing at the bottom from Genius. Spotify will add these things called \u201cBehind the lyrics\u201d if Genius interviews the artist and it\u2019ll be like some facts about the song or the meaning of it.    It said that Billie wrote this song because she liked someone and they didn\u2019t like her back, and she was so sad about, she just wanted him to say \u201cI\u2019m gay, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like you.\u201d This really stood out to me. To spare my prideTo give your lack of interest an explanationDon't say I'm not your typeJust say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation This was exactly what I was feeling at the moment. My childhood friend who I liked a lot told me that he didn\u2019t like me at all and that I was \u201cunattractive\u201d and \u201cugly and annoying\u201d It hurt. A lot. Her music helped me calm down and it was relatable. So, those are my favorite lyrics from her songs. I really recommend you go look at this song ",
