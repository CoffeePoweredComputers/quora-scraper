            "answer_text": "Q: As a musician what do you always carry with you? There are a couple of ways to interpret this question. The short literal answer is that I always try to have a couple of picks in my pocket, even if I\u2019m not on a musical expedition, because you never know if you might get a chance to play someone\u2019s guitar or mandolin or tenor banjo, and they take up literally no space. Specifically I try to have a yellow Jim Dunlop Tortex .73mm, for guitar or banjo, and a slightly stiffer JD Tortex green .88mm for mandolin. Come to think of it, I generally don\u2019t leave home without a mandolin. Let\u2019s hear it for small sturdy instruments. (I generally have a couple in a small change purse, and it\u2019s worth noting that a bright yellow pick turns practically black after a week or two in that environment. Because money is dirty. Wash your hamds.) But hey, let\u2019s go a little farther: what are the bare minimum gadgets to carry along with instruments if I\u2019m going out with the intention of playing? (Let\u2019s assume this is not a gig, we\u2019re not plugging in or amplifying in any way.) I have with me: -the aforementioned picks -a clip-on digital tuner. Twenty-dollar tuners don\u2019t last for me\u2014for some reason they die in a few weeks. YMMV. I got a forty-dollar Boss TU10 and have been using the same one for five years, changing the battery every six months or so. -a single or double instrument stand. (Rare is the jam location that has them built in on the wall and my thanks to those venues!) -guitar capo and banjo capo -spare strings -a handy string-changing kit including pliers, clippers, a small awl for getting the strings off the tuner pegs, perhaps a stringwinding crank. -iPad. Invaluable. Loaded with lyric cheat sheets (could be sheet music too), lists of songs and tunes, and available for on-the-spot recording if I hear a tune I want to learn later. Also a tuner app (backup since its much less convenient than the clip-on). ",

To a show, I obviously always take my guitar, gig bag, and tuner. If I\u2019m playing electric, I always take my own amp, which may or may not be frowned upon, but I do like a certain sound and want to be able to dial in with no fuss. I always take my own cables and nail clippers. The cables aren\u2019t needed that often, but they are there just in case. An extra set of batteries for my acoustic, and that\u2019s about everything I need. I play with my fingers so I never need to take strings, though I do put on fresh strings the day of the show. ",

Inscribed on the guitar pick is I love you x and my daughter\u2019s name. She and her mother got it made for me, and gave it to me for my birthday a few years ago. I never actually play with it, partly because the pick is metal and has a rough edge and would basically saw through strings in a few hours, and partly because it\u2019s too personally valuable to me. But I carry it with me everywhere. ",
