            "answer_text": "Definitely not. Remember, music industry is not just major labels and record sales and radio airplay and royalties, which are the few aspects of music industry that have declined. A huge growth in the music industry recently is actually in music instrument sales. And not just acoustic instruments either, but electronic instruments. In fact, it is very recently when we had a barrage of musical instrument inventions in recent memory. Companies like ROLI, Haken, Marcodi, Korg, Yamaha, Roland, Teenage Engineering, IK Multimedia, Novation, Native Instruments, and many others have invented entirely new instruments or have re-released improved versions of vintage gear, which now all command very high prices. Because of technological advances as well, we have seen software really take off, with companies like Apple, Cockos, Avid, Steinberg, and others seeing sales of their digital audio workstations increase, because even amateurs, hobbyists, and basically anyone who want to get their hands on audio software get their products. Not only that, mobile music production has also taken off, boosting the sales and reputations of companies like Intua, IK Multimedia, Apogee, Arturia, and many others. Of course let's not forget who was once the king of the music industry in recent years - Apple. Music is still their second best revenue stream behind the iPhone. And considering that Apple is a very huge company, that just means that their music selling and streaming s device contributes a lot to the music industry as a whole. Although major labels are getting punched in the gut, many other smaller companies are taking the growth instead. Because of highly democratised music creation and distribution, the likes of CD Baby and Distrokid have taken over the market for anything less than the top stars. So while a new talent is simmering up their game and fanbase and value, companies like Distrokid are already milking their cash before the major labels do. And of course we can't talk about these companies without talking about where they distribute to, and that's the likes of Spotify, Bandcamp, Tidal, and yes, even the great Apple Music. There's also the new but already ancient music industry model, the patron model. You might have heard of Patreon, the service where people can pay artists directly to be able to continue their work. That is of course how it was done in the very very early days of music, when kings and lords actually paid musicians to make music for them, and to the musician, these were their patrons (which is where Patreon got its name, get it?). It's a very \u201coff the grid\u201d way of doing music business in terms of typical capitalist business, but it is in all ways still part of the music industry. Speaking of typical capitalist business, music industry is really milking it at the top star level. Because of companies consolidating into giant conglomerates here and there, not only do they get to save money, they get to increase revenue and therefore maximize their profits. Movie tie-ups, theme songs for events, co-branding, product endorsements, globalising brands and musical acts, super wide distribution channels - all of these really up the value of a typical single artist or act, comparable to what only superstars could do as early as 20 years ago.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It's dying because everyone has a Spotify or Pandora account, or they use YouTube. Some people still pirate music. Barely anyone wants to pay for music when it's available for free through those platforms. The average person is not going to stores to buy albums anymore. There are people who buy music, but local record stores are going out of business really quick. So it's not like there is a huge market for new music. However, because of platforms like soundcloud and bandcamp, you're only a few clicks away from making your album available to the entire world. There's actually so much new music out there, ready and available to be listened to. You just have to go out of your way to find it, and you have to filter through a lot of music before you find something you like. So we have this weird paradox in which the market is completely saturated with all this brand new music in every genre you could possibly imagine, but nobody cares. The music industry isn't dead, there's just too much new material, and people want it for free. So the competition is immense and there's almost no money in it for the artist. It's tough choosing to go through hell for a year to write and record an album if only a handful of people are going to buy it for a few bucks. ",

            "answer_text": "Supply and demand in the digital age have forced it to change dramatically and quickly. There is still a learning curve to making truly great sounding music in a home studio, not to mention the years of commitment to the craft of music itself, but in reality anyone can record and post high quality originals in multiple venues. In fact, the market is so flooded, and the classics so available for almost nothing that one could say the digital market has made music free. So what! The future of music is now back to the place of patronage. Only today it isn\u2019t a handful of composers being patronized by the aristocracy. It is going to be a panoply of artists patronized by the netizen. I see that some folks are still selling music and making a living. The labels still have fantastic production facilities and marketing wings. Still, I think a new model can emerge, one where a dedicated fan base of five or ten thousand donate a small amount each year to artists whose life, message, and of course music resonate with them. If the average netizen decided to spend fifty bucks a year in patronage to their favorite digital age artists, we are talking well over $500 billion dollars a year. The cash is there, now the digital age musician needs to learn the craft of connecting to an audience of patrons. The \u201ctickets\u201d of the Internet age are waiting to be printed. How do we learn to set an anchor in the tsunami? ",

Radio used to serve as the free introduction to new music, remember (those who somehow think that the \u2018free\u2019 music streaming on Pandora or Spotify has \u2018ruined\u2019 the saleability of music). Radio used to pay the record companies for the right to broadcast that music (still does) - but now the streaming services (other than the pirate ones -oh, & there most certainly were pirate RADIO shows!) pay for the rights. People still spend a huge amount of money on music LOL Concerts, streaming services (lots of them are PAID services), buying online (ITunes!!!), and physical albums (just go ask the average KPop - BTS fan - they\u2019ve got MULTIPLES of each album sometimes!) KPop rules the teenybob pop music world right now - Korean entertainment moguls certainly don\u2019t feel their industry is failing LOL They churn out a couple 100 new groups yearly, and make a ton of money.The Japanese music business, second largest in the world, isn\u2019t hurting either. Believe the Indian music business is thriving as well. All these music industries ADAPTED to the times, paid attention to what their customers wanted, and delivered it. If the US music industries failed to do this, oops, too BAD. ",

There is more music available now than ever before and anyone can release their material online for very cheap. The streaming sites pay artists and labels for plays. 1 million plays on Spotify earns you about $3500, on apple it\u2019s about twice that. Live gigs are where the real money is, but that money is what feeds artists, managers, and agents. Labels are cut out unless the artist signs \u201c360\u201d deals with big labels and they get a piece of everything it are also involved in everything. New business models for music are put in practice all the time. Eventually, music will all just be free , but you\u2019ll pay to go see your favorite artists live and hopefully enough money can be made from that to sustain everyone involved. The problem is that without the revenue from album sales, a band or artist or dj has to be constantly touring to generate money. This makes it much harder to produce new music. The labels have less money to work with to fund an album and the artists have to play more events than before to sustain. ",

It seems to me that where the industry used to do a lot of the work that musicians are typically not good at - self promotion, business and money management, that\u2019s largely left to the acts themselves to do. The result being that the acts that are making it big these days are being found through competitions and social media. They are all very good at playing the media game and haven\u2019t typically spent years slogging up and down motorways in tatty vans to build up an audience by playing live. These days it\u2019s very easy for musicians to produce almost market ready recordings and build up a following online before they even get in front of a real audience. It\u2019s more of a marketing industry than a music industry. As musical tastes change and the formats we consume it on also change so does the industry behind it all. It\u2019ll always be there but it will evolve out of necessity to survive. ",

I would hope that the access to new music, not being supplied by record companies and big businesses being more accessible could somehow put some soul and life back into the mix. There is still a lot of good music out there, but it is being over shadowed by hype and big money. Production has become more important than the meaning of songs. Nothing to say but everything to show. Shock effect as opposed to tears. The saddest thing is what the audiences are accepting as music. I guess I\u2019m just getting old and have seen the development of music for 60 something years and in my eyes it has been slowly sinking into the toilet for the last few decades. The innocence has been lost along with human equation in recording. Auto tune, along with countless other effects that destroy the natural performance and turn it into a compressed mass of nebulous garbage that gets eaten up by people who don\u2019t know what good music is.

The \u201cindependents\u201d were often tied into the larger companies and were less independent in reality. Nowadays, I think that there are more genuinely independent companies, and of course the streaming services have dented the traditional modes of distribution. What we are seeing is a recomposition of the industry where the monopolies hold has lessened. Of course, the end result might be a new set of monopolies. I\u2019ve not touched on the non-western aspects as I don\u2019t have much information on this except to say when I look up non Western language acts on Spotify, even quite niche, they can be found.
