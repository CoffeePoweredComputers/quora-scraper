            "answer_text": "Well if you are talking about the best LIVE BAND, there are 2 that immediately come to mind - Led Zeppelin and The Who. Both played with great fire, passion, and focused energy, something really lacking in today\u2019s music (IMO). I saw both bands in all their glory - The Who in 1970, 1973, and 1975 - Amazing! Led Zeppelin in 1970 and 1971. WOW! But if you are asking about the best band in terms of creativity, songwriting, and influence, it has to be The Beatles. As a 4 piece they were so tuned into each other. I remember Eric Clapton stating that when he was in The Yardbirds and first met George he said they seemed to be like one person, they were so \u201cin sync.\u201d. ( forgive the unintended pun!) - Although not the live band The Who or Led Zeppelin were, ( well, not after those amazing Hamburg gigs anyway) their influence is still felt today - They have outsold every other band and continue to do so almost 50 years after they ceased to make music together. <3 I know I gave 3 bands as my answer but there is no ONE BEST band. It depends on your viewpoint, it is a subjective question that will only receive subjective answers..like mine. ",

            "answer_text": "Led Zeppelin. A totally different animal live than in the studio. Jimmy Page is a master producer, more so than a guitarist. He exploited the talents of a unique drummer and singer to perfection. Shared studio expertise with the bassist to create groundbreaking arrangements. They take artistic license with improvisation and pay tribute to their influences on stage. Runner up - The Who. Very similar characteristics under the control of Pete Townshend. Arguably better songwriting, vocals, bass & drums. Glad we have both. ",
