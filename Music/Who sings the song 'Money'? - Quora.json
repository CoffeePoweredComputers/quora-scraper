            "answer_text": "\u201cMoney\u201d was also an early Motown song sung by Barrett Strong in 1959. The Beatles covered it! Everyone calls it just \u201cMoney\u201d, but technically it\u2019s called \u201cMoney (That\u2019s What I What). The \u201cthat\u2019s what I want\u201d part is sung as a refrain by the Beatles in between vocalizations of the lead singer who was John Lennon. Their producer George Martin played piano on the song. The song with Barrett Strong was not the very first on Motown\u2019s label, but it put Motown on the map: It was Motown\u2019s first real hit. The song was written by Tamla/Motown founder Barry Gordy with the help of Janie Bradford. Barrett Strong\u2019s version (the original \u201cMoney\u201d, which has been covered many times) came out in 1959 but did not hit big until 1960. ",
