            "answer_text": "The best way to quit Quora would be to ask this question with your real name, and then go about making a mockery of every ludicrous quora policy.  Say, \" be nice, be respectful\" policy. Why do you have to be nice to people, why do you have to respect people.  Did they do something to deserve it. Are their views logically,  ethically,  morally correct? If yes, do respect them.  Be nice to them, learn if you can learn something from them.  Now the overwhelming majority would be idiotic.  Either they don't have all the info about something, or if they have they take a stand that is complete antithesis logic.   But before being churlish with those people,  attack their arguments, point out the flaw. So the ethical mirror. If you have done this successfully, either the person would pull out the old trick of \"if you can't attack the argument, attack the person.\"  and that is the best time for you to break that silly, idiotic, anti-constitutional policy of quora : \"be nice,  be respectful\".   Now you get to attack the person yourself. Be as rude as you can be.  That person will surely report that comment,  you will get a message from quora moderation save that as a screenshot.  Re-ask this question, save as a screenshot too. Keep doing it.  It would be fun. A great way to vent your frustration and show those powers that be that you don't let anyone screw with your rights.  And then you know share those screenshots on Twitter. Tag the owner of quora also.  And may be make a hash tag.  P. S.  You should really first put down their argument,  then only should you attack that policy. Otherwise people would think :that you couldn't argue the argument and hence attacked the person. And we definitely don't want that.   Show the fallacies of their argument.  P. P. S : this is only for fun, not to incite some one. Take it in a good humorist way. ",

            "answer_text": "This is going to have to be a multi-stage plan: Quora, Inc is already a company with shares. This is good. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not traded on the stock exchange, so this makes it harder. Stage one is locate the shareholders. In my 3-minute research they are held by at least three executives, plus an investment firm. You need to identify them.Next approach them with an offer to buy the shares. You need more than 50% of the shares, so depending on how they are distributed you might need to approach several of them. You need to offer them enough money per share for them to transfer them to you. I have zero idea of how much what would be, but given the involvement of an investment firm, it\u2019s going to be 7 or 8 figures at least.Once you control over 50% of the shares, you need to get rid of the existing board of directors. Quora may need to pay compensation.Appoint a new board of directors that will accept your orders. Tell them to shut the company down and distribute the assets to the shareholders. It\u2019s likely to be far less than you paid, as the share value, especially in tech firms, is normally far more than tangible assets. This is especially true if you want to shut down the biggest asset, the site, making it unsaleable.Be a bit careful with the above. Doing so is clearly not in the interests of the other shareholders, and they have legal protection. You may find yourself sued or otherwise blocked. Best to buy 100% of the shares at a good price. That\u2019s another few tens of millions - possibly even higher as it\u2019s a sellers market.You have shut down the site. And lost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Well done you.Addendum The Quora directors and investors, pleased at their ability to build a company and make an excellent profit selling it, go on to set up a new one. Called \u2018Query\u2019, it does the same thing as Quora. Because Quora no longer exists it\u2019s able to pick up a lot of the users and traffic, and becomes even bigger. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: How do I quit Quora? I want to cancel my profile and have nothing to do with this. Speech is either free or it\u2019s not. Your thumb is either on the scale, or it\u2019s not. Only a coward is afraid of free and open dialogue. Here\u2019s the First Amendment of the US Constitution: First Amendment Please feel free to point out the part that says a private company has to allow you to say whatever you want to. Even the Supreme Court has never ruled that a private company needs to allow random people to say or write whatever they want in a forum that they control. This is because no charitable interpretation of the amendment would lend itself to stating that. You have freedom of speech, questioner. You can create a blog, post THOUSANDS of Instagrams, tweets, and Facebook postings; you can even stay up late at night making and releasing YouTube videos until you have flooded the site. You can even livestream yourself on several dozen other websites. The government, with rare exceptions, will have no problems, with that and in fact will even allow content which might violate the laws until it\u2019s pointed out to them and they direct the site to remove it. Quora asks that you follow a few basic rules. If you cannot, or simply will not do that, then they MIGHT sanction you. You can also leave comments if you like; however if they insulting, racist, demeaning, or argumentative, the person who answered the question can delete. I know that I do\u2026sometimes HOURLY. Those are the limitations of the site and if you don\u2019t think that you can abide by them, then perhaps you should find someplace to \u201cemote\u201d. Anyway\u2026if you click on photo and go to Settings, it will direct you to the steps necessary to delete your profile. It\u2019s actually pretty easy and it should be over with in a few minutes or so, after they confirm that you really want to do it. You might want to brush up on the whole \u201cfree speech thing\u201d as your understanding of it does not seem to match objective reality. ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds to me as though you\u2019re struggling to get off despite having limited time and limited resources to stay on. Quora is consuming your valuable time because you stay on far too long, and, of course, it costs you in data. It sounds like Quora addiction (social media addiction). Like me then you have a bit of a problem. I tried to quit for good but came back. Fell off the wagon! There are options to deactivate or delete your account but even doing that won\u2019t stop you from either reactivating your account or signing up again, at some point. Perhaps, though, you don\u2019t want to quit it for good but if you had the time and resources you would continue. In that case, you need to find the time and money to carry on. I\u2019m going to suggest a thing or two which may help you to either give Quora a long break or give it up altogether (if that\u2019s even possible). Turn off email notifications from Quora so that there\u2019s nothing in your inbox to lure you back in. I tried a \u2018Quora lite\u2019 by alloting myself an hour daily on Quora and no more, or only replying to comments - didn\u2019t work, once you\u2019re at Quora you will browse, read, and compulsively search for good questions to answer. There will be prompts in notifications from time to time - someone would like YOU to answer their question - how can you refuse? You want to help and be useful or kind - nothing wrong with that, of course but how quickly did you have to decide that you can\u2019t help (answer) every single request that comes your way - too many hours of your day would be taken by it. It\u2019s worth remembering that people ask a lot of people to answer their question. It\u2019s easy for them to click, click but it\u2019s hard for you to take time to compose a good answer. There is interesting stuff to read, don\u2019t get me wrong. Since being on the site will inevitably start the ball rolling the idea then is not to venture onto the website. Stop yourself from logging in - far easier said than done. You can ask yourself: What is driving me to spend inordinate amounts of time on Quora? Now, in my case, it\u2019s pretty much loneliness, and the desire to connect with people - something missing from my offline life. I realize that Quora is not the answer because what\u2019s required is face-to-face stuff. If you manage to find a substitute for Quora to satisfy your desire for company then you may be able to give it up entirely or use it more wisely. So, it\u2019s obvious what you must do but it may be very, very hard to do. You\u2019ve got to stop. Don\u2019t check Quora - stop cold turkey and resist the urge to come back. And be savvy to the rationalizations you offer yourself to come back. ",

            "answer_text": "Did you know that Quora questions are answered by other users, and almost never by Quora staff? Even though you didn't ask this question anonymously, we have no way of knowing which other account you are talking about. Even Quora staff probably don't have any way of knowing. As such, I can only give you possibilities. Do not take this personally, because I would say the same to anyone I didn't know. The first possibility is that you used that other account for serious violations of Quora rules, and did not post anything the moderators thought was worth keeping. Even spam accounts don't always get deleted when the owner is banned; their spam content is wiped, but if they also posted non-spam stuff, the account itself might be left on the system so that the non-spam content could remain. For an account to be completely deleted, it must have contained little redeeming value. If this happened, though, you would have received multiple warnings in advance, and probably several temporary edit blocks of increasing length. You would know, in other words. So let's look at the other possibilities. You might have deleted the account yourself and forgotten about it. Yes, this is unlikely, but in group of people several million strong, one-in-a-million events happen daily, so I should at least mention it. You would have needed to go into your privacy options, chosen to delete the account, and then not logged in for more than fourteen days for the account to actually be deleted. Which brings me to the final possibility: the account might not actually have been deleted. For example, maybe you logged in using Facebook when you formerly used Google, and you were doing it from a different computer or browser than normal, and you hadn't linked your Quora account to your Facebook account. Circumstances like that could cause Quora to create a brand new account because the site would have no way to know that you already had one. If you think that might have happened, go back to your normal browser and log in with the Google or Facebook account you used before. If that still doesn't fix it, go to your user profile and look for the contact menu; describe the situation to Quora staff, making sure to give them the name on the other account you are talking about, even if it is the same as the one you are using now.

It\u2019s not.Your lawyer, will give you details on what forms to fill in and this will then be sent to this company and they\u2019ll have to delete ALL your content no matter of all this \u201ccontent is ours.\u201d No, they are not the law and law is very different. Law will actually say content is the users not quora. The question even can also be questionable because some are writtern by users who are on the pay program.They cannot say to a user who takes their content, and posts it on their blog. So saying it\u2019s their content and then going into court saying.. \u201cThe user who wrote the content was banned/or deleted their account and then took WHAT THEY WROTE, on their blog.\u201d You know how stupid that will look on any social media corp who do that. In fact, most of these companies think that if a user posts content that they can just do whatever they wish with it but by law it\u2019s not true. They just haven\u2019t been challenged by many but those who do challenge in court of law, find these corporates back off and delete the content because they don\u2019t want to look like thieves and against online users. And the fact is there is \u2018limitation of intellectual property rights' in their terms of use of someone else\u2019s content even when these social platforms have policies in place. It\u2019s very ignorant thinking policies written and typed out is law, because it\u2019s not and they know that if they sit down with a lawyer who really does know what they are talking about. Law can be challenged. So can policies in the court of law and over turned. That\u2019s what law is also for and law evolves through time too especially with social media. Example, using a photograph that someone else took and quora then says it\u2019s their property to use as they will, will have them being sued for using a photography that is the intellectual property of the creator. They forget there is law about \u201ccreation, ideas, content designed, written by anyone.\u201d An example.. Federal jury presided over by Judge Alison Nathan finally ordered the agencies to pay $1,200,000 as compensation for violation of intellectual property rights. Copyright was deemed to have been infringed precisely on the grounds that, contrary to the argument posed by the agency (that everything that is published on Twitter may be used without any authorisation being required), Twitter's licences do not include the right to use users' content for commercial purposes. And quora IS using content for commericial purposes, to drive traffic to their site, to make money from the content. I suggest quora deletes all content when someone deletes their account or when Quora bans someone as that is the user content no matter what their policy says on their website. Someone will soon challenge them and I daresay that is around the corner. ",

            "answer_text": "Deleting your Quora account is fairly simple. All you have to do is go your profile. Proceed to privacy and click on \u2018Delete Account\u2019. Your account will be deleted if you do not login within 14 days of deleting your account. If you do so, your account will automatically be reactivated. You must keep in mind that deleting your account does not remove the questions you have posted as they belong to the Quora community. However, once you have deleted your account your questions won\u2019t appear with your name publicly. The things that are removed from public view are your photos, bio, answers, comments, votes, endorsements and messages. You should bear in mind that deleting your account does not delete your content that has been shared by others outside of Quora.  If you have a query whether deleting your quora account is a reversible process, let me tell you that it is not. It is not possible to recover once you have permanently deleted your quora account. If you plan on returning to Quora sometime in future, you can deactivate your account instead of deleting it. You can do so by going to Settings in your profile and click Deactivate Account under Privacy. You can easily reactivate your account whenever you wish simply by logging in again. Hope this helps :) ",

How do I find the port my localhost is running on Windows? netstat -a -o There you will see many IP addresses. Local host is 127.0.0.1 what you see past the: is the port number. If you would like to know what process is responsible for that then pay attention to the PID (Process ID) column (the one on the far right)\u2026. I tried to figure it for a period of time and checked the internet. Finally, I found the solution from Quora and solved another problem. I couldn\u2019t remember it exactly. Anyway, thanks Quora. From my perspective, I am trying to submit the best answer that I can have although my English and knowledge are not good enough.

If you think you want him inside you, buy some condoms before any of this happens, and when you grab him down below and you feel him getting hard, tell him you\u2019re wet and his feels big and fat enough for you. Now, because he\u2019s your best friend, follow my advice for during sex too. When he puts it in you, tell him how good it feels. Beg him to be rougher. When you are taking it in the doggy style position, tell him you\u2019ve been a naughty slut and you hope you can take the spanking you deserve. I hope this helps, and I sincerely wish you a sore,m very satisfied vagina. Oh, and make sure to ride him, make his balls bounce. At the end of it all, tell him he owes Derek. LOL ",

I love interaction with most but interaction on here is not always pleasant. Know it is not a debate site but even just considering the technical aspect you have to read multiple answers to try to get a consensus to be somewhat assured you're getting the right answer especially if subjective. I love the site but wouldn't give it an A rating. Guess it became imperfect when I came on it. Quora's success or demise will come from within. Easiest method is to just let nature/Quora take its course. ",

What is your hurry? Nothing you wrote gives any sense of urgency except you seem to feel this need. Ask yourself why. I am not talking down to you so please don\u2019t take offense with what I am telling you. You are young, so very young, and at your age it seems as if it has taken forever for you to reach the age you are now. Let me tell you that there is a phenomenon with time that we experience. We all do, everyone of us. The passage of time appears to pass at an ever increasing rate of speed as we age. The period from your birth to where you are now has taken you, your whole life to travel. Whereas I can go into my closet and find a jacket that I bought before you were born and to me it seems like yesterday. I can remember the purchase and maybe something in particular about the sale or sales person. My car looks nearly new and I drive it with pride and get compliments on it. You were just eight years old when I bought it. Do you see my point or are you confused as to why my trip down memory lane? My point my young friend is you have created a sense of urgency regarding your feelings where there is really none. In affairs of the heart it is nearly always the better decision to move slowly then slow it down a bit more. At your age and this being one of if not you very first affair of the heart, you really have no knowledge of where it is going. If you are lucky this will be but one of several in your life. You must understand that you are very inexperienced with this state of mind. Just relax and enjoy the ride and your life. Life has ups and downs so one should optimize the pleasures of the good times as those memories get us through the bad times. I hope my convoluted method of writing this leaves you with some small something that may assist you in making your journey more interesting and help you to slow down and smell the roses along your way.

And for question #2, the closest I can get (which may very well have the answer you are looking for) is: How do I change what topics I follow on Quora? If, for example you want to look up : Salmon Fishing, you would type into the \u201cadd Question or Link\u201d box at the top on the right : Topic: Salmon Fishing. This will take you to another page with a whole lot of questions on it, but no \u201cSalmon Fishing\u201d topic. On the left hand side of this page, is a list with Topics on it, just above Blogs :  Click on Topics. This will take you to a new page, which has, on the far right, something like : Don\u2019t See the Topic You\u2019re Looking for? and underneath that is a box marked : Create Topic. Click on that and type in Salmon Fishing - et voila! that becomes a Topic which you can then click on to follow. One point however - if you are the first and only (or one of under say, 10 people to follow a topic, there will be few answers, and even fewer questions on that Topic, so to get better info, you may want to go Broader rather than too Specific. Under Psychology, for example, Specific is the way to go\u2026  ",

Why? The process of deletion isn't that easy. It takes time. Initially, 14 days deactivation period, then deletion and then also I can't assure you whether you could use same email account to create a new account because I didn't know about it specifically. So, due to one edit history, would you like to go through this process and still you don't know whether Quora will allow you to create new account with same email id or not.  Though, I'll suggest you to not delete your account due to one edit history. It doesn't make a big difference.  Or, if you like to delete, then check this post to know the deletion steps: How do I delete my Quora account? Hope this helps. Thank you! ",

Women used to say, \"Not unless we're married, and I won't marry you unless you grow up and get a job.\" If a woman says she wants to marry but lets a man have her without marrying her, he feels that she's a liar. Marriage clearly means nothing to her or she would insist on it instead of just giving herself. If she gives herself to him without marriage, how can he trust her not to give herself to someone else? If he already has her, what would marrying her give him that he doesn't already have? Intimacy without commitment is like icing without the cake. It can be sweet, but it's going to end up making you sick. A woman sets her price by what she does. If her price is a few dinners or movies, she isn't worth much. If her price is that he dedicate his life to taking care of her before getting her, she can be a priceless treasure. What you do shouts so loudly that nobody can hear what you say. There are only two possible modes when a girl interacts with a guy: 1) she can be his toy or 2) she can be his treasure. You've all seen a little boy play with a truck. He pushes it this way and that, then, when he gets tired of it, he throws it away and grabs another toy. It is very hard on girls when boys get tired of them and throw them away; the book \"Unprotected\" by Miriam Grossman explains biological reasons why this is so. It is very wrong for a man to toy with a woman. Unfortunately, many men seem to feel that it is perfectly OK to play with a woman and throw her away. Enough women permit this that men can keep doing it for a long time. It sounds like he wants to play with both of you. If you tell your grandmother what you say to him and what he says to you, she can tell you. If you can't do that, you will find out in due time. To defend yourself against this happening again, you can do what my wife did to position herself when I told her I was going to date her, details here: What My Wife Told Me Before We Were Married When I did that, the wheels turned behind her eyes for a few seconds, she gulped, and said, \"Yes.\" As a woman, she was more interested in being wanted than in wanting. She knew that the time would come when she'd have the flu, she'd be pregnant out to HERE, the other kids would be leaking at both ends, the house would be hip-deep in diapers, and she'd be too sick to do anything about it. If I was really smitten with her, I'd stick around and help her through it instead of running off. That kind of attraction happens quickly and she could see it. She acknowledged my claim on her, but she laid out a few terms and conditions which are described in the article above, specifically that I acknowledge that she was a treasure and not a toy, using those exact words. She also insisted that I agree that the purpose of being together was to decide whether she and I would get married. That took her immediately out of the \"toy\" category. We've been married since 1971. It worked because I wanted her strongly enough to meet her terms and conditions, she wanted to be wanted, and because she really did want to be a treasure for her husband. Being treated as a treasure made her happy, and there is no joy for a man this side of heaven like having a woman like belonging to him. The important point was that she knew enough about men to demand that I treat her as a treasure and marriage candidate from the beginning. She tells young ladies to do that. If a guy walks away from a women who declares that she intends to be God's treasure for her husband, letting herself fall in love with him would be a BAD idea. There's an old saying about romance, \"It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that ZING!\" The zing is the man's desire for one specific woman. If it isn't there, there's no way to make it happen. There's another explanation of this concept at What Do Women Want? #8 - Courtship ",

Now, if you want to delete the whole company, you can\u2019t unless you somehow acquire the company and shut it down, which is not easy to do. I suppose there may also be a way to delete the site through hacking, but besides the severe legal penalties you\u2019d face (including civil actions, fines, and prison time), I assume it would be incredibly hard to do and since Quora probably has their data backed up they\u2019d probably reinstate the site (even if some of the content was forever lost the website can still be reuploaded and I assume at least some of the content is backed up and could also be restored) so at the end of the day the site would still exist and you\u2019d be in prison for a long time (and you\u2019d also be forever hated by millions of Quorans).

Second, if you are confident to delete your quora account, then go to your profile picture. A list of things will be appearing. Click on setting. Click on privacy. Down there, there is a section called deactivate account. Delete account. Simply press either one. Just remember that once you delete your account, it is irreversible. So think wisely.

Quora will let you delete your account. To do so, you will need to go to the settings page by clicking on your profile picture and then settings.  From there, select Privacy[1]  From here, you can choose to either deactivate, which will turn off your account but leave the content for others to view, or delete, which will remove all of your content un-viewable by others.  Once you select one of these links, it will ask you to enter your password and then will give you a button to complete the action. If you want to know what data Quora collects and how they use it, a quick review of Quora\u2019s privacy policy[2] is a good idea.

So, due to one edit history, would you like to go through this process and still you don't know whether Quora will allow you to create new account with same email id or not. Though, I'll suggest one to maybe not erase your account due to one edit record. It does not make a positive change.

I've come so far, so something like deleting my Quora profile is like setting my house on fire. If my Quora got deleted or I got banned for whatever reason, I don't think I would ever come back. I don't want to achieve all that again a second time, as it would take a few years to get what I've lost. Luckily I screenshot every one of my achievements as proof that I did something positive. ",

Once you tell Quora to delete your account, there is a time window before it actually deletes (several days). If you accidentally touch Quora logged in, Quora assumes you don\u2019t want to delete the account, and turns off your deletion request. I have two accounts on Quora by accident. I\u2019ve been trying for ages to delete one, but it keeps getting restored. ",
