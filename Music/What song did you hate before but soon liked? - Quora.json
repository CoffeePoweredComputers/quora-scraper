I was like it isn't catchy (oh but it is) and doesn't sound good. But it is like one of my favorite sings by them now soBTS - LightsIdk i just didn't like it v much when it came out, but recently i have been listening to it while doing homework, since it is on my chill playlist, and it just grew on me. New(ish) song and MV check it out!Jay Park - All I Wanna DoIdek same with his song Me Like Yuh, but i love him and learned to like the songs.Also he just released a song like an hour ago or something (idk it is 01:50 rn like maybe he released it at 00:00.

            "answer_text": "John Legend Ordinary people. Am actually a huge fan of John and his great music. I actually have a playlist of most of his songs. I used to skip ordinary people every other time. Has a lot of emotion and it's lyrics are a bit complicated. There was some kind of turnaround when I broke up with my Girlfriend. Apparently I was not ready for the jilt and I so wanted her back. I soon discovered the song more than anything conveyed all my emotions. I sent it to her and we are back together. It may not be because of it, but I think I like it now much more than I hated it before. ",
