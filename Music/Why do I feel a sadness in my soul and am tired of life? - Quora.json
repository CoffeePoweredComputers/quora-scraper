            "answer_text": "I know what it\u2019s like to feel tired \u2013 and not just in the physical sense. The world that we live in is an exhausting place to be. It is wearing. It is thankless. It is endlessly trying and scarcely rewarding. You\u2019re tired simply because you live in it. You\u2019re tired of loving too much, caring too much, giving too much to a world that never gives anything back. You are tired of investing in indefinite outcomes. You\u2019re tired of uncertainties. Tired of grey.  I know you haven\u2019t always been this worn out \u2013 that there was a time when you were hopeful and pure. When your optimism outweighed your cynicism and you had an infinite amount in you to give. I know you have been chipped away and worn down piece by piece \u2013 a broken heart here and an un-kept promise there. I know the world hasn\u2019t always been kind throughout the games you\u2019ve played and that you\u2019ve lost more times than you have ever won. I know you\u2019re feeling uninspired to try again. I know.  Because the truth is, we\u2019re all tired. Every single one of us. By a certain age, we are all nothing more than an army of broken hearts and aching souls, desperately searching for fulfillment. We want more but we\u2019re too tired to ask for it. We\u2019re sick of where we are but we are too scared to begin again. We need to take risks but we\u2019re afraid to watch it all come crashing down around us. After all, we\u2019re not sure how many times we will be able to start over. But here\u2019s what I beg if you\u2019re this close to giving up: give it one more try, with feeling. I know you\u2019re tired of your attempts. I know that you\u2019re at your wit\u2019s end. But the truth about that second wind of passion is that you\u2019re never going to realize you have it if you do not keep on running past your first.  We\u2019re all more resilient than we think, and that\u2019s an indisputable truth. There is always more love that we are capable of giving, more hope that we are capable of having, more passion that we\u2019re capable of unleashing and flooding out into the world. We just don\u2019t walk far enough down our own roads to reach the point where we\u2019re seeing those actions pay off. We want immediate results and when we see none, we give up. We let the exhaustion stop us. We grow frustrated with the lack of feedback and we assume that means we have to throw the entire attempt right out the window.  When you\u2019re tired, go slowly. Go quietly. Go timidly. But do not stop. You are tired for all the right reasons. You are tired because you\u2019re supposed to be. You\u2019re tired because you\u2019re making a change. You are exhausted for all the right reasons and it\u2019s only an indication to go on. You are tired because you\u2019re growing. And someday that growth will give way to the exact rejuvenation that you need. ",

That\u2019s the ugliest thing I ever saw,\u201d and \u201cPoor boy.\u201d one person said that he\u2019d have been better off staying at the hospital with other people like himself. He says if all the people with various disabilities were kept together, \u201cat least there\u2019d be nobody to stare at you because you weren\u2019t like them.\u201d he\u2019s even afraid of himself when he looks in a mirror Mr lamb says He tells Derry to look at a certain part of the garden and describe what he sees.

A thump and he is dead He starts to weep as he couldn\u2019t save even thank you to him the most important person who taught him the value of life Why do I hate my life and always feel sad? Because you give your key to happiness to others if someone says you look ugly you may feel sad so stop hating yourself it doesn\u2019t matter how you look from outside if you don\u2019t have a pure heart I have seen many people with beautiful faces but having stoned heart Take responsibility of your own life take a look around you see flowers , plants , birds , ask the value of life from someone who is suffering from chronic disease or just saved from having an accident Enjoy your life stay away from naysayers who always make fun of you or make you feel low Spend time with those who understand you If you are sad look at the kids who don\u2019t have parents ,food , house you have everything no need to stay keep working on yourself start loving yourself brave warrior You are diamond keep shining Shernette Williams Story - On the face of it By Susan Hill ",
