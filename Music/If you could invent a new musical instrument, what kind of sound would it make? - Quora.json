            "answer_text": "Hehe - do you have any idea how many goofy, silly, ridiculous instruments already exist? That\u2019s a lot for me to compete with!! An example:  This belonged to my great-grandfather, seriously. I come from a long line of saxophonists. Apparently he could actually PLAY this thing! Anyway, my instrument? I think it would be waterproof, and sturdy, but pretty small. Something like a penny whistle, but with a bit more - I play sax, I\u2019m used to buttons - control, I guess? I would make something I could stick in my pocket, take out boating or tubing, and easily entertain my friends - like a harmonica, but not. I love the harmonica, but it\u2019s a sound that gets old real quick, especially solo. I kinda want it to keep rhythm somehow too, if we\u2019re fantasizing here. So I would invent a sturdy, waterproof reed instrument - I can\u2019t play brass to save my life - that\u2019s about as intuitive as a sax, pocket sized, with a nice sweet tone and somehow also the ability to function like a wood block or tambourine. Not an ocarina. Nope, I love them but they get old faster than a harmonica. Clay is a cool idea though. This thing probably exists! Katie\u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, Philip, I have no idea at all. I've been puzzling over it since you asked me, and I haven't come up with anything. Most of the weird brass instruments have already been thought up and tossed on the scrap heap of history. My ideas for instruments are usually about making the ones we have work better (or just maybe just differently!). One of the more wacky ones was installing a single valve with multiple independent layers with electronic indexing on a tuba. Which would be cool, but probably super expensive. And what if you forgot to charge your tuba before the show? Now that I think of it, there WAS an instrument I thought about building. I don't want to say what it was, though, so nobody steals it! Hopefully it just sounds like a good horn when I'm done, though, so it probably wouldn't be considered new, just unconventional! ",
