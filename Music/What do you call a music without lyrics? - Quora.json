            "answer_text": "Specifically, vocals without meaning is called \u2018scat\u2019. That\u2019s jazzed-up terminology, or more formally known as: the euphemism for \u201cbullshit\u201d. The times when jazz instrumentalists are playing without even vocals, it\u2019s called a musical \u2018bridge\u2019, or \u2018interlude\u2019. When any singer is improvising vocals without reading specific lyrics it\u2019s called ad-lib, and a random musical ad-lib without instrumental cues would be a chant or rhythm. A constant or periodic rhythm which varies independent of all known orthography is called a signal. A musical signal with no discernible pattern at all is called audible noise. Audible noise is created by alternating rarified and compressed pockets of a substance called matter, creating harmonics. Absence of conjoined matter is called space. Absence of harmonics in space is called silence. During musical movements, all silence is called \u2018rest\u2019. Finally, orthographic musical symbols suggestive of opus title, harmonic frequency, tempo, ad-lib, rest or silence are not considered as being \u201clyrics\u201d, even in the presence of a mute, silent, or resting vocalist. A musician who does not vocalize is called an interpretive dancer. An interpretive dancer who attempts to communicate lyrically is called a pantomime or mime. A mime may use a prearranged construct of movements or silent instruments to mimic unspoken language which is representative of language but \u201cwithout lyrics\u201d is employing a set of signals called \u2018semaphore\u2019. Whether or not semaphore is any type of \u201cmusic\u201d depends on the subjective opinion of its observer, but semaphore is undoubtedly non-lyrical. Since the OP had only solicited \u201ca music\u201d singular, I chose the hardest one for which to answer: jazz. ",

That song has been with me for my entire life, and introduced me to music from day one. Now, I adore music. It helps me calm down from anxiety and bouts of severe depression.
