            "answer_text": "Ah yes the photography business\u2026 It is a very difficult and saturated industry to get into but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t pursue your passions. It\u2019s a very rewarding business if you know how to brand yourself. Here is how I built my photography business when I was 16 years old and continue to build now that I am 20. You need to be doing free work my friend. This (in my opinion) is the fastest way to grow your business and be successful in the long run. Here is what I\u2019ve found. So many people (photographers) charge crazy low prices because they think that\u2019s what their customers want. You get what you ask for. Rather than get valuable clients that are going to solely book you when they need a photoshoot, you are getting people that just want to pay the lowest price and don\u2019t really care who the photographer is. By charging a higher price, you get people (usually with higher incomes) that are willing to pay that hefty price for a quality service they can trust. Now these clients are who you want to be booking. So how do you get these high paying clients? What you need to do is build trust. You NEED an outstanding portfolio that really shows why you\u2019re worth that much. Why do photographers pay thousands of dollars on Nikon equipment and stick with that brand (or other brands)? It\u2019s because Nikon has proven over and over again that they only have high quality products. They have a track record and can show you what the cameras produce. Say a new camera company comes out today. The wrong move would be to make a random website and social media page, and charge thousands of dollars for a product that no one knows about. The right move would be to hand out ten cameras and let the photographers try them out, receiving feedback in the process. Then posting other people using the cameras (social proof) on your social media and website showing how awesome the product is. This is exactly what you need to do for your photography business. Don\u2019t try to undercut photographers because not only do you look unprofessional but you are damaging your brand by telling people you don\u2019t know your worth! So First thing is free work building your portfolio. Now what you are going to do is pick a specific niche. Now I\u2019m not talking about just saying you\u2019re a wedding photographer or you do corporate photoshoots. We really need to find that super tiny crack that we are going to fill. For me, I shoot Adventure Engagements. I take couples around to different National Parks and deliver awesome portraits with beautiful landscapes in the background. To my amazement, I found that when I buckled down on my niche, turning clients away that didn't fall into my category, I began to attract a huge crowd of people that wanted to book my service just due to that fact that I only shoot outdoor adventure engagement shoots! So really choose what you want to go into. It can be in the food industry or even first birthdays for a specific gender. You will find that people are willing to pay astronomical prices when you are an expert in a specific niche. That\u2019s how I am able to charge $1000/ session and be booked the whole summer! Keep in mind that this is a business and if you build it right, it\u2019s going to take time. I started out by doing free photoshoots. I worked free for nearly a year before I was able to charge. First of all, I was not the best photographer at first and wasn\u2019t comfortable and confident enough to charge, and second I really wanted to build up my portfolio to have a solid foundation. Building a photography business nowadays goes way beyond just being a good photographer. It involves building a website (that will actually popup when someone searches it), building an audience, knowing how to advertise\u2026 it gets real detailed my friend but it\u2019s worth the learning curve. There are a few more steps to this business building process on the back end including advertising, networking, building a converting website, what photography gear to get (from a minimalists perspective) and other key factors you need to take into consideration. I teach all this stuff in my blog (link in profile). Stop by and send me a message too. I\u2019d love to help build this so us creatives can thrive! ",

You just take photographs for the love of the craft. But, if you can master all of these potential roadblocks, you\u2019ll be turning something you love into a viable full-time career. That makes the struggles worth it ",
