            "answer_text": "Assuming the headphones are good and plugged in correctly, I\u2019m seeing at least one possibility for the cause\u2026 (A word of explanation first) When music is mixed and mastered, typically the vocals are dead center in the mix. If the music you cannot hear vocals in is a surround mix (5.0, 5.1, 7.1, etc.), chances are good the vocal (other than any reverb or delay effects applied to the vocal, or backing vocals) are only present in the front center speaker signal. So if you are listening to a portable device, be sure you are playing a stereo mix, not a surround sound mix. If you are plugging your headphones into a surround sound receiver, try finding a mode on the receiver which will output stereo rather than surround. If your source music IS already in stereo, it may be that one side of your headphones is wired in reverse and the sound is cancelling itself out, but that\u2019s unlikely as you\u2019d still hear it, but it would sound \u201codd\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Poor wiring, in some part of the system of the headphones, can cause this. Make sure there\u2019s no frayed wires, and everything is plugged in. To make sure, unplug and replug whatever you\u2019ve got it plugged into. If you still hear it, get more specific about your system. If it\u2019s an older stereo playback type of machine, that\u2019s much more serious than just a pair of JVC buds in your iPhone. Go to The Ultimate Headphones Testfor a true frequency. There\u2019s several, so use what you need in case things start going south, and remember to ground your cables. ",
