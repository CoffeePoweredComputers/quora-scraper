            "answer_text": "I hadn\u2019t heard that he had, but it\u2019s not surprising. Telecasters are simple, reliable, versatile, cool, and have a long history in rock-n-roll music. Its bridge pickup is capable of certain ice-picky, biting, high end tones that White often uses, however he achieves them. But it can also sound quite like an acoustic guitar (when you run both pickups) or beautifully bassy, when you use only the neck pickup. That\u2019s if he\u2019s using a traditional Tele. They also make them with P-90s and with humbuckers in the neck or in both the neck and bridge (like mine). I\u2019ve even seen them with a Charlie Christian pickup in the neck. The possibilities are infinite. Jack White can play anything he wants. He\u2019s going to sound like Jack White even if he shows up playing a vintage Gibson ES-175. He could play his whole set on a Martin acoustic and it would still sound like him. Update: Equipboard reports, with photographic evidence, that Jack White has been spotted playing a Fender Highway One Telecaster with what looks like a Bigsby vibrato arm. It\u2019s one of 41 guitars they have listed for him.  ",

            "answer_text": "I read an interview with him, recalling his love for playing \u2018beater\u2019 guitars, cheapo models, craptones that he found in pawn shops, because they challenged him to be able to get a decent tone out of them. But then he said, he just got tired of fighting all the time, and decided to graduate to top shelf instruments, so he could put more energy into actually creating music, rather than wasting it struggling with sucky instruments. I guess the Tele had the tone characteristics that he was hearing in his head, as well as the play-ability. ",
