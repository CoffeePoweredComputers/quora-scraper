            "answer_text": "Check this out if you\u2019re looking for a big overview: Beginner\u2019s Guide to Turntables | How to Buy a Good Record Player \u2026 My personal recommendation is the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon. It\u2019s pricier compared to most record players, but it\u2019s simple, reliable, and built to last. Asking yourself a few general questions will help you focus on what you want out of a record player. Keep these in the back of your mind as you shop! What is my budget?Do extra \u201cbells and whistles\u201d matter to me (Bluetooth features for example)?What is my style?Determining your budget is your first step. There are record players that range from roughly under $100 to upwards of $500. Think about how serious you are as a buyer. You also want to think about what you want out of a record player. Are you one for \u201clatest and greatest\u201d, or do you have simplicity in mind? Lastly, be aware of what you think looks good and suits your personality. Whichever record player you choose, you\u2019ll want it to be something that fits your style as a record collector. $100, More or Less: At the bottom of the spectrum, you\u2019ll find record players offering basic functions. They play records. Although it may seem easy to grab and go with a record player from this range, be wary of their construction. Many of these options don\u2019t have the best designs, or they feature \u201call-in-one\u201d solutions (built-in speakers, or other portable options). If portability is something you value, then there are a few options in this range from Victrola and Crosley. If you are a serious \u201caudiophile\u201d or someone looking for good quality, then it\u2019s probably best to keep away from this range of record players. True, these do the job, however, they don\u2019t do a proper job for someone who is meticulous about sound quality. The portable options in this range are OK if you want something to carry around, but there are more capable options for home stereo systems. 200-$400: For the beginner looking for an affordable record player that offers exceptional playback and features, this range is best. Record players in this range are typically well-made. You\u2019ll find a wide variety of brands that offer great turntables. In my opinion, this is the best range to browse overall. You\u2019ll find quality options from brands like Audio Technica, ProJect, Denon, and quite a few more. This range is full of hot contenders that have great sound quality compared to lower-priced models. They are equipped with better cartridges/styli and are better builds overall. Some brands: Audio Technica, Pro-Ject, Crosley, Denon, Rega, Pioneer\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Anything with a counterweight and anti-skate on the tonearm. Otherwise the lack of ability to adjust the tracking and anti-skate force will damage records and sound like crap. You can buy cheap older turntables like this for real cheap, but they usually need work. If buying a new model table, you won\u2019t find much under $200 that\u2019s of safe and decent quality. I recommend the Audio technica ATLP120 to all newbies. Easy to set up. Well designed, sounds good, and can be upgraded to sound better over the years. It usually costs $250\u2013300 with the AT95E cartridge on it. ",
