            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve played a lot of strats and pauls/335s over a long time. The variability in \u201cplayability\u201d between different guitars can be extreme, even within the same model (although in my experience Les Pauls don\u2019t vary that much when you adjust for controllable factors not inherent in the guitar design). To try to answer the Strat vs. Paul playability question, you need to eliminate these non-inherent variables, such as string gauge, string type, string action, neck width and girth and neck radius. Yes, these can all tremendously affect playability but you can apply these variables to either guitar design. Playability variables that are inherent in the archetype of each guitar: Scale - The nominal measurement from nut to bridge. String path - From the tuning peg to the tailpiece. Length and angles, design of headstock and of bridge and tailpiece. It\u2019s important to use a standard definition for playability. Given that most players are referring to how easy/hard it is to bend notes (in the context of only the variables we are examining), let\u2019s say that the measure of playability is how much or little force you have to apply with your finger/s to achieve the bent note. More force = harder to play, less force = easier to play. Physics provides a simple, elegant answer to this question. For a given pitch, or fundamental resonating frequency of a vibrating steel string, you need a certain amount of tension in the string. The amount of tension necessary is determined by the STRING PATH LENGTH (NOT JUST THE SCALE LENGTH) from tuner to tailpiece. If only the scale length mattered, all 25.5\u2033 scale strats would have basically the same playability characteristic for the same setup profile. This is definitely not true and easy to verify. Guitars that are \u201ceasier\u201d to play have shorter string paths. My easiest to play guitar is a Steinberger with a 25.5\u2033 scale length. It has zero headstock length, and a very compact bridge/tailpiece assembly that adds only about an inch to the scale length. So the Steiny has a string path length probably less than 27\u2033. My \u201chardest\u201d guitar to play is a partscaster Strat that uses the classic headstock shape and the classic vibrato bridge/tailpiece assembly, down to the vintage steel tremolo block. The headstock adds a variable length to each string\u2019s total path, from a little more than an inch on the low E, to almost 6\u2033 on the high E. The bridge/tailpiece assembly is pretty compact, but the strings break over the bridge saddles, disappear down thru holes in the bridge plate, and then through the trem block. In the vintage steel block, the string holes are very shallow (the ball end is almost exposed at the end of the block), in theory to take tone and sustain advantage of the heavy steel block. This assembly adds 2-3\u2033 to the total string path. So for the high E string, you\u2019ve got a string path that is 6\u20137 inches longer than the Steiny! That\u2019s a lot of extra length, and represents a lot of extra tension on that high E string. Not surprisingly, the high E string on a classic vintage Strat, when gauged normally vs. the other strings, feels pretty darn hard to bend. No wonder SRV, who liked heavy-gauge strings, tuned his Strats down 1/2 step to lessen the tension! And a clue as to why Jimi\u2019s upside-down headstock was a great feature for bend-heavy blues. The Les Paul\u2019s scale is 24.75\u2033, so it saves .75\u2033 vs. the Strat design. That isn\u2019t going to account for the sometimes amazing perceived difference in playability. The Les Paul headstock is 3x3 configuration vs the Strat\u2019s inline 6. Overall it\u2019s shorter. and especially for the high E and high B strings, you can save up to 5\u2033. The bridge/tailpiece combo isn\u2019t all that different in string path length from a Strat if you have the \u201cstop\u201d tailpiece. If you have a wraparound combo bridge/tailpiece you save at least a couple inches. Not surprisingly, most LPs are judged by most people to be \u201ceasier\u201d to play. And the wrap tailpiece models will be perceived to be the easiest. May your notes bend to the end of the rainbow :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Coming from someone who plays and appreciates both: neither is better than the other. Though they are the most popular solid body guitars ever created and the majority of recorded electric guitar music features either one or the other, they are very different creatures, each with their own unique features, specifications, and pros & cons, and each coming in a variety of configurations deviating from their standard form. Stratocasters (Strats) come in a much wider range of prices, from various third-party copies to Squier entry-level and budget models to Fenders made in Mexico, Japan, or America (in order of least to most expensive). They also come in a wider variety of styles and are more easily modifiable than Les Pauls. The standard Strat design is comprised of a triple single coil pickup configuration (low output pickups with a very bright, snappy, clanging sound) and vibrato bridge (which Fender incorrectly refers to as \"tremolo\"), though they are also commonly manufactured in SSH (neck & middle single coils and bridge humbucker) or HSH (neck & bridge humbuckers and middle single coil) configurations and with hard-tail or Floyd Rose bridges. Fender also makes them with either maple or rosewood fretboards (maple being brighter, harder wood). Its body shape is less blocky than a Les Paul's, featuring curves & contours that more naturally rest against one's body and make extended playing sessions a bit more comfortable. Les Pauls are generally much more expensive for a number of reasons. Unlike Strats which use a \"bolt-on\" neck that screws into place, Gibson Les Pauls have \"set necks\" which are attached to the body using a tightly fitted mortise-and-tenon or dovetail joint and secured with adhesive. If irreparable damage is done to the neck (or if it's cheaper to get a new neck than it is to refret the particular guitar), it is much easier and less expensive to replace a Strat's than it is a Les Paul's. The Les Paul is also a much heavier guitar with more sustain and overall resonance - this is partly because of the build (Les Pauls are larger and typically made with mahogany as opposed to the Strat's typical alder or ash bodies, with mahogany being a much heavier, denser wood) and partly because of the electronics. A standard Les Paul comes with dual humbucking pickups (which have a higher output than single coils and a warmer, darker, fatter, more compressed sound than Strat single coils), though they sometimes come with a third humbucker or dual P-90s (which is as close as you can get to single coils on a Les Paul apart from coil-tapping the humbuckers, though that only approximates a genuine single coil sound). The bridge design is usually a tune-o-matic & stop tailpiece combination (similar to a hard-tailed Strat, which improves on tuning stability and intonation due to the lack of movement), though some models have a Bigsby vibrato unit in place of the stop tailpiece (similar to the standard Strat vibrato bridge, though the strings remain on top of the guitar instead of going through the body, and the Bigsby is designed for much more subtle vibrato and doesn't pull off heavy detuning maneuvers like dive bombs [think Jimi Hendrix's rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"] as easily). Les Pauls also have a single cutaway (though some copies like the Yamaha LPs come with dual cutaways) while the Strat has a dual cutaway design; some would argue that this makes reaching the higher frets easier on a Strat, though I personally find it to be simply an aesthetic difference. There are other differences such as fretboard radius (the Strat is more curved with a 7.25\" [vintage-style] or 9.5\" [modern-style] radius while the Les Paul is flatter with a 12\" radius) and scale length (Strats have a 25.5\" scale compared to the Les Paul's 24.75\" scale, meaning there is more space between frets on a Strat than on a Les Paul) which make selecting between the two guitars even more of an individual preference. You simply can't compare them because they are, as I've pointed out, entirely different animals with distinct designs, tones, and feel that are not better or worse. You can, however, take a specific Strat and a specific Les Paul (since they come in so many different variations and from so many different manufacturing plants apart from just Fender's and Gibson's) and compare them in terms of overall quality of build and parts. That would be the more appropriate question to ask in terms of putting the two up against each other. ",
