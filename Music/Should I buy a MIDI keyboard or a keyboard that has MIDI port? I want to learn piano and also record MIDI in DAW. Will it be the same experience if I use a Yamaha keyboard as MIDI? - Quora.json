            "answer_text": "Try to get a digital piano with full-size, weighted keys and a MIDI output option. I got a Williams Allegro 2 digital piano, which is a low-budget digital piano. It works really well as a MIDI controller (over USB\u2014it doesn\u2019t have a MIDI port). And for learning piano it is WAY better than a typical MIDI keyboard. I also use the built-in instruments for recording sometimes (using the line outputs). I have other MIDI controllers too, but the Williams piano is my best one because it has the best key action. By the way, Yamaha makes great products including digital pianos (better than the one I have). You asked about using their keyboards\u2014it would just depend which type and how similar the keys are to playing a piano. Finally, get a sustain pedal like Prashant said. ",

            "answer_text": "A Midi keyboard is a keyboard with a Midi port. A USB Midi keyboard is a keyboard with USB. Some USB Midi keyboards only have USB. Some have both Midi and USB. The same type of Midi or USB Midi keyboard that you could use to learn piano can be used with a DAW. However, an instrument referred to as just a Midi keyboard or a USB Midi keyboard might not have sounds built in. These are called Midi controllers. You would want a digital piano with Midi and/or USB or a synthesizer keyboard with Midi and/or USB. Otherwise you will need to connect headphones to your computer and run a software synth/piano to hear any sounds. Any Casio with speakers and midi and/or USB is fine. Anything over $200 USD will probably include Midi and/or USB. ",
