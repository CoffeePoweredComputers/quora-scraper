            "answer_text": "Honey, this is a very important question. Here is my response. My interpretation of a lavish lifestyle is one \u201cspent living right, healthy, not holding back in responding to your major needs and that of others, and finally impacting others so much that they have something good to say when you're finally twelve feet under\u201d That's all. It's OK to immerse wealth but what good is it when you don't help others, show love or impact anyone. A lavish life is a life spent in a beautiful rhythm causing everyone to dance to the sweet melody you emit. I hope this was helpful. Let me hear from you. Stay lavishly right! ",
