            "answer_text": "Depends on the work and its relevance to you. Its all relative. You won\u2019t give a damn until it would freaking affect your life in some way. Let\u2019s say you have to do a work for a friend and he would fetch you $1000. On the same time you already have a request for a work that would fetch you $1200. After all the calculations which seems pretty easy, right? There is 95% probability that you\u2019d opt the latter work. The same case, $1000 work is from a Tech Giant, let\u2019s say Google! The calculations would change and you might settle for $1000 hoping for a good relation with Google in future. Although this example does not seem relevant, it just shows that you give power to your work. Unless you\u2019re in it for real or it won\u2019t affect you in an adverse way, rare is the possibility that you\u2019d give a damn! Start searching for work that you care about and won\u2019t mind doing that even at odd hours, even at Weekends, even when you\u2019ve to go to a party. Then only you can dedicate yourself to it seamlessly. It will come automatically. It will flow through you. Have a great day! ",
