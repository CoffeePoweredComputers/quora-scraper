            "answer_text": "If you're on Android, download Google Rewards, answer basic questionnaires, get Google Play money, spend it on music.Listen on YouTube, but half the time you're not doing favours for the artist.Break the law via file sharing.Find a hobby that can also be a business. You get enjoyment, get paid, then buy music.My favourite, it's not free, but buy the album that an artist has put effort in to (I hope you listen to artists and not people produced by noise factories). Savour that purchase, you'll enjoy it so much more and it will literally sound so much better. I buy a CD then compress to FLAC only.",

            "answer_text": "These days its really easy to download songs from internet. Just type the name of the songs followed by 320kpbs download(320kbps is bitrate here).So many links appear after the search and you can easily download from there just by clicking download button in the link. Also you can use a third party application to download an mp3 song. For example 4K Download \u2013 Free and useful applications for PC, Mac and Linux can be used to download any video/audio content from youtube and a lot of options are available in this application depending on the quality of video/audio you want. I hope this helps..!! ",
