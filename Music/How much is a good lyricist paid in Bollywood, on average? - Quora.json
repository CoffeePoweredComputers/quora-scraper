            "answer_text": "Top lyricists like Gulzar, Javed Akhtar, Prasoon Joshi and the likes demand anything between Rs. 7.5 - 10 lacs per song. Sometimes it becomes a whole-movie deal wherein the lyricist pens all the song lyrics of a particular movie and gets anything between Rs. 25-30 lacs. There is a huge controversy going on inside the industry about sharing the revenue (earned from the songs) with the composers, lyricists and singers but no consensus has been reached yet. (The profit is being shared by the movie producers and the music companies right now). Source: My friend, who is a struggling music director in the industry. ",
