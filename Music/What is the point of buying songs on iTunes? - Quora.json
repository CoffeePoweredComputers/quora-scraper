            "answer_text": "The question is incomplete: what\u2019s the point in buying songs through iTunes compared to what? To having no music: you get music. Most people like music, though if you don\u2019t, certainly it makes sense not to buy any. To buying a CD and importing (Thank you, Joe Crofts, for the reminder): buying though iTunes is practically instant, avoiding either a trip to the store or waiting (and usually paying) for shipping, as well as hooking up an optical drive if your computer doesn\u2019t have one built in. It\u2019s also cheaper if you only want a song or two instead of the whole thing. To using a streaming music service of some sort? You get exactly what you want and nothing else, to keep as long as you want without any further payment. To some other online store? Convenience, mainly, if you\u2019re playing it through iTunes or on an iOS device, since it cuts out a couple of extra steps. To copying the files for free from somewhere? Well, I for one prefer to buy, if the track I want is available that way. Aside from the idea that people should be paid for what they sell, knowing it\u2019s legal, good quality, malware-free, etc. brings a bit of piece of mind. If your way of finishing the question isn\u2019t covered, please add it. ",
