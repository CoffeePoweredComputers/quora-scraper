            "answer_text": "There are many songs that bring back memories, some are happy, others are sad. I answered a question similar to this a while ago and I gave an example of a song that gave me a sad memory, so this time I will use a happy one. My son was born with a serious, life threatening medical condition called Arteriovenous Malformation. Now, in most instances it may not be life threatening but in my sons case, it was in his brain and it caused a bleed and it was pretty large. The first surgery he had lasted 14 hours and it was 14 hours of hell. If any of you have children you can understand what I mean, knowing that your own flesh and blood is having surgery and there is nothing you can do but hope and pray, and what made things even worse was that he had just turned 4 years old two months earlier. When the pager went off to let me know he was out of surgery I ran as fast as I could into that hospital and up to the surgical suite (I didn\u2019t even wait for the elevator). When I got to his floor they were wheeling him into ICU but his neurosurgeon had told me that everything went well and they were able to eradicate 90% of the AVM. Anyway, this is where the happy song comes in\u2026after a few days went by and they gave him his own room, we were watching an old movie (a western) on television and as the cowboys were riding into the sunset \u201cHappy Trails,\u201d was playing. I looked over at my son and he had a big smile on his face and he was singing\u2026Bom-ba-dee-da-Bom-ba-dee-da. I thought it was so cute and sweet, and I was just so happy that he seemed to be back to his wonderful self again. From that time on, he would ask me to sing him that song and that lasted for well over a year and each time he would get that big smile on his face. But to this day, whenever I hear that song, whether it\u2019s the original version or by anyone else, I think back to that big smile on my son\u2019s face and no matter how I am feeling, or how much pain I am in, it always gives me a little joy.
