            "answer_text": " \u200b\u200bAre you 18 & not started investing yet ?Holy crap\u2026\u2026..!!But don\u2019t worry. That\u2019s what I am here for.You will come over many benefits for why should you invest earlier while you read this article.Investing early makes the chance of achieving higher returns are higher.It\u2019s wise to invest while you\u2019re young as therisk aversion may change according to your age.Nonetheless, if you are thinking of investing, the time is now! \u200b#1 Time value of money; Rupee today represent a great real purchasing power than a rupee a year hence. Therefore one should use it to compensate the decrease in value.This might be weird to think about, but it\u2019s the truth: money loses value over time. If you put 1,00,000 Rs in a savings account today, that same 1,00,000 Rs won\u2019t mean the same thing one or more years from now.In essence, you are losing money by not doing anything with it.If you\u2019re leaving money under your mattress or in a safe, it would lose value because of the following reasons;\u2022 Inflation\u2022Preference\u2022Risk\u2022Investment opportunityAvailability of opportunity of investment for earning additional cashflows make money more valuable today. #2 Hedge against Market Crash. People see the market crashing and assume that it\u2019s riskier to invest than just hold on to their money. But the fact of it is a smart investor doesn\u2019t need to worry about market crashes.Below are the words of Chris Nicholsonfrom FutureAdvisor; If you\u2019re in your 20s, and you invest in the stock market and it crashes, you don\u2019t have to realise those losses. You can just ride it out. If you invested at the stock market peak of 2000 and fell asleep until 2002, you would\u2019ve ended up with 150% of what you started with. And there was a huge crash in-between. Most people lost about 60% of their money. There\u2019s a really simple reason you don\u2019t have to worry about a market crash: The only way you actually lose any money is if you had cashed out when the markets were low. But if you hold on and wait for the markets to recover, you\u2019ll end up with more money than you started with.To put it in another way: you don\u2019t care what the market looks like over the next few months. You care what it looks like over the next few decades. #3 Compounding Interest \u201cCompound interest is the greatest mathematical discovery of all time\u201d\u2013Albert Einstein Compounding transforms your working money into a highly powerful income generating tool. It is the process of generating earnings on an asset\u2019s reinvested earnings. Also known as \u2018plough back of interest\u2019.It requires two things: re-investment of earnings and time. The more time you give your investments, the more you are able to accelerate the income potential.Let us try to understand it with an example: Assume two individuals, named them Ram and Shyam. Both are of same age.When Ram was 25, he invested Rs 1,00,000 at a compounded interest rate of 10% annually.Ram\u2019s friend, Shyam, started investing when he reached age 35. He also invested Rs 1,00,000 at the same rate of 10% compounded annually.At the age of 50, Ram will have 10,83,470 Rs whereas Shyam have 4,17,724 Rs.What makes the difference ? Both are 50 years old, but Ram has Rs 6,65,746 (10,83,470 \u2013 4,17,724) more in his account than Shyam, even though he invested the same amount of money. But by just giving his investment more time to grow, Pam earned a total of Rs 9,83,470 in interest and Sam earned only Rs 3,17,724. That\u2019s how time, discipline and patience grows the wealth. #4 Improves spending habits Investing early allows you to develop disciplined spending habits. The goal here is to earn money by saving money which needs focusing on your budget and cutting expenses when needed.This is impossible with poor spending habits and a life full of impulse buying. Through early investment, the lessons learned will pay off in the long run,This benefit is generally overlooked by many, but investing early on definitely helps develop positive spending habits. Those who invest early on are much less likely to have issues with overstepping their boundaries in spending over the long run.Investing teaches important lessons and the earlier you are able to learn those lessons the more you can benefit. #5 Ability to take risk When you begin exploring investment avenues early in your life, you have a greater ability to take risk and experiment, compared to someone who starts investing later.Reason behind this is that at the later stage in life, if you realise you do not have sufficient savings; you will be more cautious in your choice of investments. #6 Better choices in life As seen in the examples above (in #3), the wealth created by investing early in life is much bigger than the wealth created by someone who starts a little later.As a result of the savings back-up, you can afford a better lifestyle and an improved quality of life, helping to fulfil your financial goals.  There are some cautionary points to consider before you proceed. These are common mistakes many people make when considering what to do about investing. It is important to note that saving money to invest at a young age isn\u2019t easy, but you simply can\u2019t afford to wait to invest when it is convenient. Don\u2019t shy away from investing because you don\u2019t have enough, simply start with making small investments and give them time to mature. Investing while you are young is one of the best decisions one can ever make.  This answer is hardy 500 word long, I would like you to read the full article 2000 word long on the link below. You will came over many illustrations and common pitfalls for investing early. . . . I write at Sowmayjain.com ",

            "answer_text": "Glad to see another wise man out there looking to get started with investing early in life. Ray Badger had a great answer and if I may add to his: 1-Knowledge is indeed power, and to add to that:  so is a broad, neutral perspective:  Also consider reading the Wall Street Journal every single day (minus its editorials and Personal Journal sections, those are not so neutral).  The WSJ will obviously keep you up on track with business news and policy decisions across the world, but the difference with the newspaper (print or online) vs some free source like CNBC or Yahoo Finance is that it will help you understand the breadth/diversity of the economy in a realistic way with high journalistic standards.  It will also keep you up on macroeconomics news (for ETF investing) while occasionally giving you good microeconomic features on specific companies (for investing in individual companies).  It's worth the $35/month if you're a serious investor. My other recommended sources for knowledge:   Investments (college textbook, analysis, overview) by Bodie, Kane, Marcus for McGraw HillSecurity Analysis by Benjamin Graham (fundamentals analysis)The Intelligent Investor also by Benjamin Graham (big picture)Buffet's Biography by Roger Lowenstein (for how to apply Graham's book in the context of life and for overall motivation/inspiration)4-While playing on paper is good to start, for sure (I did so back before Yahoo Finance had quotes up online), I'd suggest that you also consider graduating yourself to real live investments as soon as you're ready.  There's nothing like having real skin in the game. With online brokers charging $7 dollars a trade, you learn much faster if you you invest as little as $400 to buy a single share of 3 or 4 different ETFs and/or securities and then watch the portfolio go up or down each day from $400 to $398 to $401, etc.  Yes, it'll cost you $7 * 4 = $28 to make $400 worth of trades and you may realistically take a year or two or three to earn back that $28 (plus the $28 to let go of your positions), but $56 + whatever capital you lose on the initial $400 is a fair price to pay for real life mini-lessons during your learning phase in stomaching daily ups and downs and mostly ignoring them if you're a long term investor (even if those up or downs on most days isn't the difference to win/lose a Happy Meal at Mickey D's).  For beginners, it also naturally trains your mind right at the start to think in terms of assessing your performance with rates of return and not absolute return.  One day you may have to invest $400 million instead of $400.  It doesn't matter if it's either of those numbers or any amount in between, you should measure performance, for the most part, by your rates of return. 8-Ray is providing great advice on all 1-7. ",
