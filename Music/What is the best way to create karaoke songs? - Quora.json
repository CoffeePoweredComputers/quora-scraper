            "answer_text": "There are ways to significantly lower the vocals on any stereo song file in order to create a near-perfect instrumental or karaoke version. In this guide, I'll show you a couple different methods (audio/phase/voice canceling and configuring the EQ) using popular free and paid audio editors. Audacity Audacity, which is available as a free download for Mac and Windows, offers a simple way to reduce vocals on a digital song file. Using a method called audio canceling, you can scrub away most of the vocals from an MP3, or other digital audio file, by splitting the track into two, inverting one half of it, and switching the audio to mono. Pro Tools Avid Pro Tools, much like Audacity, provides tools which you can use to perform audio canceling by inverting one half of a track to reduce vocals. Since Pro Tools is an expensive app (for Mac or Windows), it does offer many more tools to improve the finished result, since audio canceling does take a toll on overall quality. FL Studio FL Studio (another paid app, but only for Windows), is a great program for beginners. It has a few tools that you can use to reduce vocals through the audio canceling method (also called phase cancellation). While the name of the process is the same as on Audacity and Pro Tools, the method is different and takes a bit more time, but is easy to follow using the video below. GarageBand While Apple's GarageBand is incapable of doing audio canceling, you can still mess with some of the tools it has available in order to decrease the vocals from a track. The process, luckily, is pretty simple: just add the AUGraphicEQ plug-in to your track and drop the middle frequencies in the graphic equalizer, where the vocals are the strongest on a track. These Methods Don't Remove Vocals It's important to note that these methods won't completely remove the vocals on a track, since that's what many videos and articles online claim. This will just lower the audio of the vocals significantly, offering you the best option of an instrumental for tracks that don't readily have one available for download online. Of course, you can also search for free or paid karaoke tracks online, pay for a minus one track, or get a multitrack recording from a studio, but if you don't need to get rid of 100% of the vocals, the methods above should work just fine for you. Are there any other audio editing programs that you use and want to learn how to reduce vocals with? Let me know in the comments below. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to your question lies in your question itself. \u2018Create\u2019. Using DAW\u2019s (Digital Audio Workstations) like FL Studio, Ableton Live, Nuendo, Cubase etc. Nothing beats that. If you have at least a little bit of musical knowledge, you should be able to produce good quality karaoke tracks in about 2 years. Practicing and learning for at least 4 hours each day. Also, you should keep learning and understanding music and its branches. Shortcuts are for amateurs and lazy people who just want to get the job done. And for that matter, there is no hardware or software which can eliminate vocals from a song completely as in 100%. I could explain the various details involved in production, but it will be too long. If you have any specific queries regarding production, please inbox me. :) Good Luck~! :) ",
