            "answer_text": "Another dynamic that was missing with the DC5 was- Dave Clark was the \u2018owner\u2019 of the band, and the other four were more or less paid sidemen, contracted to form the group. As principal songwriters, John and Paul felt co-ownership of the Beatle phenomenon along with Ringo and George, and were soul-mates from the beginning, continually burning with a bright creativity and pushed each other to be \u2018toppermost of the poppermost\u2019. As great a songwriter Mike Smith was, this crucial group dynamic seemed missing, and his collaborations with the other sidemen did not have that extra spark to push continual growth. (even with Dave Clark, the non-singing mediocre drummer listed as \u201cco-composer\u201d of all their originals\u2026) ",

            "answer_text": "I have heard that The Dave Clark Five was a fairly good band that never got the props they deserved. But, maybe it's because besides Dave Clark, I have no idea who else is in the group. They seem kind of bland. The Beatles were never bland or boring. They were not afraid to speak about subjects that others would avoid. War? Let's talk about Vietnam, Paul! Ok! Or, perhaps because The Beatles were always changing their music and their hair and their clothing, they never became stale. The music never lagged; it was always pushing forward. Most bands in the 1960's were following The Beatles and never quite catching them. And in music, you either innovate or you die. And very few of those 1960's bands even made it into the 1970's unless they completely overhauled themselves. Prime example: The Bee Gees. ",
