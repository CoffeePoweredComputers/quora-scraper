            "answer_text": "She admitted to drugging men to have sex. She only said it so she wouldn\u2019t get exposed by anyone. Instead, she exposed herself. A lot of people don\u2019t worry about it because she\u2019s a FEMALE. She always feel like she gotta address every little thing on social media. She can\u2019t handle the negative comments. She\u2019s known the slander people on her livestream and was caught stating that only black women are ghetto and are the ones that tend to hate her when we\u2019re the same ones that let her in the female rap music industry by streaming her songs. she disrespected a MUA for no reason. And the MUA told her experience about working with Cardi b which is here.  After Cardi knew about this video, she made lies about the MUA(Makeup Artist) that she was drunk. The Make up Artist explained Cardi moving around and getting upset while getting her make up done. Cardi made a livestream about the video and the reason why she lied is because she did every red flag that the MUA warned and explained. The basically proved her point. The only difference was it was with another MUA. HERES the video here.  She admitted to only rap for the money. When you rap for the money for the money, you throw whatever is out there. She relies on Payola and that\u2019s to help promote her music and of course herself. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many reasons. She just enetered the rap game and think she shxt. Her first target to getting fame off is the current queen at the time and today is Nicki Minaj. She threw a shoe like a hood rat at Nicki for a photoshopped post that wasnt true. She went talking bad about a woman's dead child. She said the child looked like a monkey. She sent people to beaten up strippers who her husband, Offset cheated with. The strippers were scared to even go to work. She called black women roaches. She use Payola so her song can be played instead of random picks. She made her husband whos part of the migos, make Nicki Minaj change her verse on Motorsport, she bootlegged some of Nicki Minaj styles, she drugged men to sleep with her, She only raps for the money and not for her heart, she brags about sex EVERYTIME!! She literally have ghost writers. She yells in her song\u2026its not even rapping but yelling. She goes on IG and bad mouth topics and crack cringey jokes. Cardi B is literally the most overrated rapper I ever heard of. ",
