            "answer_text": "Yes they are. In fact they've been dating since 3 years now. Since BLACKPINK debuted Their relationship is just so soo sooo strong They declared it officially last year at a concert, after BLACKPINK's dating ban expired in the month of August.  They are always together   Heres a screenshot of their video call with subtitles, in english  They always go to cafe's and have breakfast together  They were seen in a hotel  They were seen in an airport together as well.  They accompany each other's stage performances. You should definitely check out Jimin dancing with BLACKPINK and Ros\u00e9 on the song Don't Know What To Do by BLACKPINK. You'll find it on YouTube. It made the South Korea headlines.    Can't you see they love each other sooooo much?! And this is their latest selfie on Jimin's Instagram. By the way, if you don't know Jimin is an Instagram king with 1B followers  And even Hobi knew about it from the start. He loves his sister in law  That's all thanks for reading. Wish them all the best of luck. They are having their marriage ceremony tomorrow.  So, if you still didn't get it, this is called S A R C A S M Jimin doesn't even have an Insta account lol. Let alone 1B followers. NO THEY ARE NOT DATING. AT LEAST IT IS NOT OFFICIALLY DECLARED. These pictures are edits I found on pinterest. Hats off! And\u2026 also, Jimin did not dance on DKWTD. And screenshot of video call with subtitles was hillarious lol XD Sorry, if I sounded rude somehow. It was just a joke. Anyways, please support Jimin and Ros\u00e9 individually. They are amazingly talented idols. And even if they ever date, don't contribute hate to them. Let their private lives be private. It's really not something of your concern. \u2018k byeee ~~~~Shelly ",
