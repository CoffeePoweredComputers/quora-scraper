            "answer_text": "A fiddle and a violin are the same instrument. The main difference between them is the style of music played and the playing techniques used to create the desired sound and musical style. For example, the violin is the instrument considered most similar in sound to the human voice, and most classical violin music tends to emphasize this \u201csinging\u201d quality of sound, with long, smooth bow strokes and lots of expressive vibrato. By contrast, most fiddle music is meant to be danced to, or was derived from older forms of dance music. Fiddlers tend to play much more rhythmically, using various repetitive bowing patterns to create a rhythmic groove or beat for dancing. If you already play (classical) violin and are interested in learning to play fiddle music, you should decide first which specific musical idiom you want to play \u2014 traditional Irish? American old-time? New England contradance? Cajun? Scandinavian? French Canadian? Etc. Then spend time immersing yourself in as much good fiddle playing in that style as you can, to get that idiomatic sound into your brain and body, and work on imitating that sound in your own playing. That\u2019s basically how I learned to play fiddle, back in the pre-Internet Dark Ages. Nowadays there are tons of YouTube videos providing fiddle instruction, and if you can find a local fiddler or two to play with you and show some things one-on-one, that\u2019s even better. Fiddle music is fun! Enjoy it! ",

            "answer_text": "The same way it\u2019s played on a fiddle, the violin and fiddle are exactly the same instrument. The only difference between the two is that fiddles tend to have a flatter bridge, which makes playing two strings simultaneously, known as \u201cdouble stops\u201d, easier. Even then this rule isn\u2019t a set one, and any violin playing a fiddle could be called a fiddle. ",
