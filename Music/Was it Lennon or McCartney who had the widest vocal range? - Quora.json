            "answer_text": "Well they both have different ranges. Paul could sing higher notes more easily. He\u2019s what I call a mid-range tenor, so he can\u2019t really sing counter-tenor notes without losing tonal support. Like in \u201cSay, Say, Say\u201d you can tell that Paul\u2019s vocal clearly isn\u2019t designed to sing that high. Not like Michael Jackson. John can sing high notes that most baritones can\u2019t reach without losing tonal support, but he\u2019s only a high-range baritone so he can\u2019t reach the same high notes that Paul can reach. At least not without losing tonal support. Paul had to sing the higher notes on \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and \u201cAny Time at All\u201d because John apparently couldn\u2019t reach them. I\u2019m pretty sure John could have reached those notes because he has reached higher notes at certain other points, but then again he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to sing them properly, which probably explains why Paul needed to sing them.

            "answer_text": "All those who said Paul are correct as Paul has one of the best ranges in music or at least he did at one time. His range was better than people that you would think have fantastic range like Michael Jackson and yet MJ\u2019s range wasn\u2019t even close to Paul\u2019s. Oddly enough though MJ and Lennon had the same range vocally, of course they sang in different keys but the actual range span was the same. Paul\u2019s range was very deceptive unless as a singer like myself you try and sing one of his songs with a lot of range only to discover you can\u2019t pull it off. ",
