            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a good question. I have trouble falling asleep on my back. When I do I almost always get SP. If you are finding sleep paralysis (SP) frightening look at it this way. It\u2019s temporary and will pass. If you are at all into astral projection or lucid dreaming, the perfect time to achieve either is when you are in SP. If you are interested in astral projection, think of yourself of being out of your body during SP. If you are interested in lucid dreaming, allow your visual mind to start showing you things and enter a dream. Once you enter a dream and know you are dreaming, you can interact with most characters in the dream. If by some chance you encounter something negative remember it is most likely not real. Fear during SP can lower your vibration and allow you to see lower level entities, or perceive spirits as bad. In the even that happens to you, you have two choices. Abort the astral projection or lucid dream and wake yourself up. If you are just plain bothered by SP try to wiggle your toes or fingers and then foot or hand and then more body parts. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely. Oddly, though, it overwhelmingly happened when a subject fell asleep in a different position, but found themselves on their back during/after sleep paralysis. Bottom line: 58% of reported SP incidents happened while the subject was supine. I highly recommend using pillows, especially behind you, so that you decrease the chance that it will happen. However, it should be stated that everyone is different, they have different triggers, etc. Lying prone (facedown) is the least likely position to find yourself in during sleep paralysis (~7%), yet I\u2019ve had several SP episodes while lying prone. It\u2019s the second highest for me. Here\u2019s a study that looked at all the data and came up with some interesting stuff: Situational factors affecting sleep paralysis and associated hallucinations: position and timing effects - Cheyne - 2002 - Journal of Sleep Research - Wiley Online Library ",
