            "answer_text": "Historically, I'd argue 95% of people are familiar with or fans of Tupac and Biggie. Currently, Kanye West has the fame and Grammys for a strong case of popularity, also Jay Z has fans across generations and being married to probably the most famous person in the world helps a lot (same goes for Kanye). If you want to use earnings as measure then Dr. Dre and P. Diddy have strong cases. Snoop Dogg has been rapping forever it seems like and is America's friendly weed ambassador. Lastly, I will mention Eminem, seems like everyone in the world knows him, and he's one of the few non-African American prominent rappers. For younger people in their 20s, the Young Money generation comes to mind, artists like Lil Wayne, Drake, and Nicki Minaj. This really is an opinion question, but going off of awards, earnings and fame, those names above come to mind. ",
