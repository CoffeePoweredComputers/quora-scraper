            "answer_text": "Hi! Most all K-Pop songs are effective for learning korean. As long as you read the lyrics in english, or even better watch a color coded lyrics video that translates to english, so you can read as you go along listening. For me one of the groups that may not be as effective (but it\u2019s up to you) is Blackpink, since they have raps that are almost entirely in english! They have a lot of english, but have some Korean as well. So it just may not be as effective, as say a group like EXO, which has a lot of Korean lyrics. Old K-Pop songs also have a lot of Korean lyrics. Even better than using K-Pop songs is to watch a K-Drama. This is so you can hear what the actors say in Korean and read English subs (or whatever language you speak) as they talk. This is how I learned enough Korean for an entire summer in Korea. There are also apps to learn Korean, that could help even more. I understand some people don\u2019t learn that way though. So if K-Pop is the way you\u2019d like to learn I recommend songs by EXO, BTS, Twice, Red Velvet, Super Junior, NCT, BigBang, 2ne1, or Stray Kids! -Keira :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think all the Kpop songs have a good lyrics to learn. I mean, because the lyrics are 97% Korean. So, i suggest you to listen the songs that you like the most. Why? When we like something, we will try to find out more about that. So do a song. When you like 1 kpop song, you have a curiosity about that song, so you will search the lyrics and try to understand the lyrics, so you can sing that song. It's easy, as long as you have willing to learn, you can do it. I just want to let you know. In my case, i improved my Korean by watching Korean's variety shows. Cause in variety show, you will watch two people or more speaking Korean, so you would understand fast, even if you don't know what that's mean. At least, you learn how to speak like that. I hope my answer can help you. ",
