            "answer_text": "Yes I Believe Marilyn Manson is an incredibly intelligent man. THe way he acts is not completely his personality it\u2019s mostly his stage persona and the way he uses that fear of the unknown and uncertainty to make people think by making them feel uncomfortable is absolutely brilliant. He uses his hold on people to provoke them and get them thinking. Just look at how he handled the Colombine nonsense. But to get a real answer you need to watch his interviews I suggest watching Michael Moore\u2019s \u2018bowling for columbine\u2019 Also just watching on YouTube interviews with him is just amazing. I plead with you think of this in a actual way even if he is the poster boy for everything \u2018Satan like\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t intelligent. HE is in my opinion one of the very few intelligent people on this planet. ANyways see ya GEMMA ",
