            "answer_text": "Well,interesting .Uneven alignment of teeth may affect your speech and pronunciation of words that are \u201clabiodental sounds\"- E.g words from \u201ct,d,th,f,v etc. Sounds of \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018 Z\u2019 are mispronounced if there is spacing between the central incisive teeth. D and T sounds are affected in cases of crowding of teething if the tongue doesn't contact the teeth . F and V sounds are mispronounced if the lower lips aren't able to touch the upper teeth. Th sh ch are misprounced if the front teeth are missing or there is a gap between the teeth when you bite. Now by these teeth I mean basically the upper and lower front teeth affect your speech ,minor aberrations in teeth alignment may not have that much of an effect,however speech can be impaired ,it really happens in cases of severe retroclined or proclined teeth. Also interestingly,people who have spacing in their teeth might find it difficult (not impossible )to whistle. P.S-However if you are a tad bit tone deaf ,don't blame the teeth ",
