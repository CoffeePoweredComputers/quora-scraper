            "answer_text": "Ideally watch time percentage should be 100% but if you want me to tell you the average\u2014 Then it is 30\u201340%. Obviously all the algorithms are mainly focusing on watch time to know the quality of the video and audience retention but it doesn\u2019t mean that if you are not getting proper watch time percentage, your channel will not grow. A video consists of cooking recipe or a song video will get maximum watch time percentage but a technical channel or any entertainment video will not get more than 50% watch time. But you can see PiwdiePie, Crazy Russian Hacker, Technical guruji, Amit Bhadana all are very successful YouTuber. From cocking channels- Nisha Madhulika is also a very successful channel. Things are only dependent on consistency in uploading videos and SEO. Initially, it will be very much difficult to grow your channel but after a certain limit of subscriber, it will not be very much difficult to make it viral. If today Amit Bhadana said \u201cI am in America and I am eating pizza\u201d. There is maximum chance for this 5 sec video to go to trending/ viral page as already he has 80 lacs subscribers, but if you are a new youtuber with less than 100 subscribers and you have made a video on very intellectual topic i.e.\u201chow NASA\u2019s scientist is calculating distance from earth to mars\u201d or \u201chow Amitabh Bachhan is shooting video for his next film with live videos\u201d, you will not get more than 50 views in one month even it is 100% qualitative content.

            "answer_text": "If you are a creator, the higher, the better. There are a few factors that seem to impact watch time percentage. First, is the video length. This should seem intuitive, but longer videos tend to simply give viewers more time to get distracted and look away. In fact, it\u2019s very common for videos to be down to 80% of viewers remaining in the first 15\u201320 seconds on longer videos, as people start\u2026get bored\u2026see a recommended cat video and then, well, who can compete with that? The longer my video, the lower the percentage of watchers that make it to the end. My shorter ones that I uploaded at the very start, months ago\u2026often have 90\u201395% retention rate:    Considering that they are 15\u201325 seconds long, this shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. My normal 7\u201312 minute videos usually are in the 40\u201360% range. If I go longer, close to 20 minutes, I\u2019ve noticed a drop-off as well, even down to 30\u201335%. EDIT 3/25/2020: from this video:  (her channel is great, recently discovered it!) She\u2019s getting 7.6% CTR and 4:25 average watch time. That video that she is talking about is 12:15, so that\u2019s just a 36% watch time\u2026yet it still got recommended on the home page!  So, I\u2019m thinking that those who are saying \u201c70\u201380%\u201d are either making very short (2\u20134 minute) videos or are lying. Or have just amazingly engaging content. End of edit. That being said, you need 4000 hours to monetize your channel, and so shooting off tons of short videos is just not very efficient for that. Longer videos just do better in most cases, due to having more total watch time, and the YouTube algorithm favors them. The content is important as well, obviously, but even more important is how you deliver it. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m really just getting into, but it helps to be very energetic, expressive and upbeat (difficult for me). It also helps to speak quickly. After teaching English as a second language for the better part of 7 years\u2026I naturally just talk a little bit more slowly, as that was needed to communicate in a classroom environment. So\u2026yea\u2026undoing that habit. Finally, video editing is important as well. Long pauses or breaks with nothing will absolutely cause people to click on something else. Time isn\u2019t always money\u2026but it\u2019s always valuable \u2014 so don\u2019t waste people\u2019s time! ",

So the watch percentage should be 100%. If it is less than that, people are skipping away before the video is over.  Based on having a less-than-100 watch percentage, you should be asking yourself: Is my video too long? (depending on the content, 3 minutes is the sweet spot for a vlog, or 7 minutes for a narrative webseries, or 18 minutes for a TED talk. Try to see where you fit compared to other posts that are similar to what you make.)Am I failing to hook people in the first 10 seconds? YouTube viewers are super impatient. If you do not give them an interesting hook\u2014right away\u2014they are just going to click on the next video.Are people randomly encountering my videos or are they deliberately going to my page because I am marketing to them outside of YouTube? Because that random people might not really be your audience. Deliberately targetting the people who you feel this content was made for, by marketing and outreach on other social networks, is going to get people that came here wanting to watch the video. So they are more likely to stay for the whole thing.Do I have unnecessary credits at the start of the video? Dude, get to the story!",

            "answer_text": "I believe it is virtually impossible to get 100% watch time with youtube viewers unless the footage is just a few seconds maybe! Most people who search for youtube videos are human and like all humans we are all impatient. I can only think of one time when I would spend a couple of reels watching a particular youtube video only because I needed to follow it intently to fix something. Majority of us will watch beginning and may fast forward to the end. Most of all the video analytics I have seen are like this\u2026 they have a spike at the beginning, trail off significantly and then a slight peak at the end of the video. Check out my latest video and see if it is worth watching all the way to the end. I am pretty sure very few people will do this even though it is a bit striking for new youtube onlookers. They will simply check the few seconds at the beginning and drag all the way to the end to see the final result. For this specific video my watch percentage is 11% even though out of 56 views there were 26 unique viewers implying a very high click through rate. However, the watched percentage does not reflect the quality or content worthiness of this video. Although over time, I an imagine the numbers will average out to give a sense of what is good content and what is no.  Draw a water droplet in charcoal. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say it largely depends on where and how people are finding your videos. A little known fact about audience retention is that people who find your videos via search (provided the videos aren't misleading, and answer the viewers questions fully) will always watch more on average than say someone who scrolls past the link to your video on Reddit, Quora or on a blog. If most of your views are coming from clicks on a link to the video somewhere, then many of those people are just curious but not necessarily bought in to whatever you're providing, so you may only see 20-30% or lower retention on those videos. If on the other hand your video is ranked in search and most of the views are coming from there then you can probably expect 40-50%+ In my opinion if your average retention is under 30% you should analyse it and see why people are dropping off. Are your videos providing value? Are they engaging and hooking people in until the end? Are they providing what they say on the tin and not misleading people with the title or thumbnail? All of these things should definitely answer yes if you want good retention times. I was averaging 20-30% retention on my videos initially, and for me the main thing that changed that was deciding on what values my videos are offering In other words, your video needs to have a specific purpose, and it needs to complete that purpose, if you expect people to watch it all. Great examples are guides, or tips - they should be no longer than is necessary to give the viewer their answer, no tangents or droning on for ages about other things - just plain and simple the guide the viewer was searching for. If you're making entertainment content, then remember that. Say you're making a Let's Play with face cam. It's hardly entertainment any more if you only say 5 words in a very monotone dull voice throughout the whole recording. Joke around, laugh with the viewer, make them feel comfortable and like they want to stick around. A very useful part of the audience retention analytics information is looking at it for individual videos and seeing what time people dropped off. Don't worry about the first big drop, most videos should have a significant drop near the start because of people who accidentally click the video or who weren't really looking for it - because those people leave right away. What you should be concerned about is other big drops. Perhaps you notice suddenly at 7:44 in your last video, 25% of the audience suddenly left. Check the video, have a look what was happening at that point, and you might get your answer. Sometimes it's obvious, like perhaps your audio quality dropped at that point, or the big boss battle they were waiting to see in the video is over, or the answer to the guide they came to watch has already been given. Other times you need to be creative and think why are they dropping off - often the answer is that your video just isn't engaging enough. (sorry for going way off topic) ",
