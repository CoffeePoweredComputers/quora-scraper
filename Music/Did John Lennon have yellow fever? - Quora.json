            "answer_text": "John never had the disease by that name, or the racial female preference by that slang definition.Just listen to his tunes. That's what he wanted the world to really know about him.I mean, he did not write a tune like 'Brown Sugar,' like the Rolling Stones, or 'Legs' like ZZTop.  Lennon wrote about wanting women to understand him, as in 'Woman.'  Stupid rumors and insinuations just demean the memory of the man, and don't help the people who spread them. ",
