            "answer_text": "I would personally go with a Mac Mini. MacOS is great for audio, and the Mac Mini has all the power you need in a compact package that cuts what you don\u2019t need so you get the best bang for your buck. It\u2019s also great for traveling, granted you have all the peripherals you need at your destination. Go for the version with the i7 if you can, and get a minimum of 16GB of RAM. For storage, get as much as you can afford, as this isn\u2019t upgrade-able and you\u2019ll have to rely on external storage for whatever you can\u2019t fit inside. Of course, if you can afford a Mac Pro, that will by all means perform better than the Mac Mini, but the Mini will suffice for most production purposes. If you\u2019re not a fan of MacOS, you\u2019re better off building your own PC than buying a pre-assembled one. For CPU, you\u2019d want to go with Intel due to the inherent advantages for audio latency and processing (which I won\u2019t go into here). For RAM, get as much as you can afford, but if you\u2019re on a budget then 16GB is enough for most tasks. The GPU doesn\u2019t matter much unless you\u2019re also doing video production - for general purposes, a RX 570 or RX 580 will suffice. Be warned though, audio on Windows is an absolute nightmare, especially USB audio. Be prepared to spend hours upon hours troubleshooting why your audio is clicking, not find a solution, and installing MacOS on the PC. ",

            "answer_text": "The computer itself won\u2019t matter a great deal. You want one with a fast processor, if you want to run tons of effects like reberbs and record many tracks at once. If you are on a budget however, any computer that you buy today will be able to hack through a respectable recording session. As for the OS, I\u2019ve always used Windows which these days works pretty well, although I covet OSX, and would gladly glide into an Apple if the price were a little sweeter. The buzz is that the industry uses Apples. Of more importance is the audio interface that you choose. If you get one with XLR mic inputs with phantom power, along with a few line inputs, you will be looking a reasonable quality mic preamps. Those along with the mics you choose will be by far a more important factor than anything else, provided you plan to record with mics at all. Again, if budget is a concern, get a decent interface (I like USB these days) and a couple of quiet mics. Throw whatever is left over at your actual computer. ",
