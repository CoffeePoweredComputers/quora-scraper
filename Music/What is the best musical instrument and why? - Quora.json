            "answer_text": "The electric guitar. It is a bizarre instrument because it doesn't do any one thing better than other instruments, but it posses abilities and qualities that other instruments cannot even begin to intrude upon.   Weaknesses It is a chordal composition instrument, but does not have the versatility of a piano. For example, it's hard to play tightly grouped notes close together on guitar.It's limited to 3.5 octaves.Tonally, the sound of steel strings amplified lacks the harmonic richness of horns, winds, or even other bowed instruments.It is a plucked instrument. Plucking has a quick decay and cannot sustain naturally like horns or strings can.Then why is it the best? Rock Star Qualities  It is incredibly easy to learn the basics of playing a rudimentary song or riff on electric guitar. Punk music was based on this. It has a low entry barrier to enter, but also an incredibly high bar for mastery. Easy beginnings encourage a lot of people to adopt the guitar and keep playing. Compare this to saxophone or violin.Ubiquity. I'm willing to bet there is a guitar in your house, or your parents house. Everyone can get access to one. When was the last time you saw an accordian?You can sing while playing one. It's portable. It's lightweight.Amplification. Amplifying the guitar changed everything. It allow nuances in the playing to shine through. It gave the guitar a level of power and energy that are impossible to match. It is the defining instrument of the 20th century and created rock music. Players personalities are personal and unique when they strap on an electric guitar. Jimmy Page has a great quote about this in a guitar documentary:  Amplification gave way to overdrive/distortion and increased sustain. This made possible for the electric guitar to become a truly melodic instrument. It allowed guitar solos to become standard middle break features in popular music. Before electric guitar, other instruments like sax or piano were more popular for soloing. Effects. Adding a few effect pedals to the guitar signal chain allows a guitarist to drastically alter the tone and shape of the guitar signal, personalizing their sound on the guitar. Certain guitarists like Dave Gilmour or the Edge have a signature sound. This is a lot harder with other instruments.Extra features: Whammy bars, walls of amps, guitar smashing, playing it upside down with your teeth, etc. It just looks the fucking coolest. Slash in an epic solo. Pete Townsend's windmills. Jack White in blitzkrieg mode. No other instrument commands the cool factor that the electric guitar does. You can jump and pose on stage. They look like sex.",

            "answer_text": "There are just too many dimensions of \"bestness\" for a single answer to be possible ! For polyphonic possibilities, keyboard instruments are king (organ, piano, harpsichord, clavichord, piano-accordion...) probably followed by plucked (vs bowed) stringed instruments (harp, lute, guitar, mandolin, ...), maybe followed limited- polyphony breath/bellows powered instruments (concertina, melodica, harmonica, ...) and bowed string instruments (violin, viola, cello). For melodic expression (timbre, vibrato, tremello, intensity) over the full duration of individual notes, the bowed stringed instruments (violin, cello) are probably tops perhaps followed by woodwind instruments (clarinet / oboe, bassoon, ...), then maybe the theremin, saxophone, electric guitar, harmonica... For sheer brashness (and volume !) electric guitar, trumpet, saxophone... For polyphonic rhythm: guitar, harmonica, ... For mellifluousness, perhaps the horns... For ethereality, possibly the theremin, flute, bass ocarina... For busy incisiveness, harpsichord, banjo... For comedy potential: trombone, tuba, kazoo, swanny whistle, ukelele.... And these are just the ones I can think of the top of my head (so please don't upset if you happen to play something I've failed to mention :-)). My ordering is of course both highly subjective and almost criminally approximate ! The only real point I was trying to make is that from great all-rounders right through to the one trip ponies, all instruments (like people !) gain some qualities at expense others, so it's virtually impossible to pick a single winner.
