Are they looking to sing professionally or just singing because their little heart and soul want to be ABLE to sing? Gosh, before I got all cruel and up in someone\u2019s grill about their singing, I\u2019d have to ask myself if it was worth it. Maybe they just have a happy heart. I as a singer have a partner who can\u2019t carry a tune, and even though it\u2019s painful at times (in a closed space like the car) I just let it happen. Because for the other person its an organic response to a song or music and it represents so much to them. ",

I\u2019ll paraphrase because I can\u2019t remember it exactly: \u201cSir, you would have a truly magnificent voice if your lower register had the power and clarity that is so obviously lacking in the upper register.\u201d That\u2019s quite possibly apocryphal\u2014I can\u2019t Google anything similar\u2014but it works.  Then there\u2019s the classic comment: \u201cIt\u2019s sort-of like singing, \u2026but different.\u201d ",
