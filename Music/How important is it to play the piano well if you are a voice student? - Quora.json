            "answer_text": "It's not necessarily crucial, but it's certainly beneficial in a number of ways. I've never heard a voice student exclaim, \"I'm so glad my vocal purity is unbesmirched by any keyboard skills whatsoever \u2014 singing rules!\"  Developing some proficiency at the piano allows a singer to be more self-sufficient. Accompanists are still a must for rehearsals and performances, but a singer who plays the piano can train himself, and can work more efficiently with students of his own, if any.  It will also improve one's reading skill and general musicianship; the practice of any instrument will help in this regard, but the keyboard is of course particularly useful for singers.  Every professional singer I know who has no keyboard skills views it as a handicap on some level, not as an asset or a neutral factor.  One of the problems I see in this area is that singers take singing lessons as kids (younger than high school age, say) when piano lessons would be more beneficial at that point in life. The formal study of singing is in general more effective later on, for physiological reasons. In this situation, it often happens that you get a voice student age 20 or so with no experience at the keyboard, when those skills could have been developed at a much earlier age with a little more planning on someone's part.  It's still possible to learn piano as an adult \u2014 very much so. But it's tougher. For a singer, it comes down to whether or not you want to be stuck learning new material only via someone else's recordings of it, in many cases. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a singer who trained as a classical pianist as a kid. Being around singers now quite a bit, I\u2019m discovering how rare a combination that is. Most singers have never had any training on an instrument. As Curtis Lindsay states, most singers start young and that\u2019s all they do-piano lessons usually don\u2019t figure into their training. Unlike most singers, I started singing as an adult, and now I do community theater as well as other singing activities. I\u2019ve done solos in churches, sang in choruses that primarily sing classical music, and of course musical theater. I gotta say, I\u2019m thankful I started as a pianist rather than the other way around. I have found that my piano skills have been invaluable to my singing in the following ways: I don\u2019t need to rely on anyone to help me learn music or wait for rehearsals to learn it. I can take the music home, bang out all the notes as much as I need to and work on it by myself as often as I need or want to- whether it be for musical theater to opera scores -thanks to all that Beethoven and Chopin I\u2019ve had to play over the years, I can read and play very complex musical scores. This is a huge advantage when you don\u2019t have a lot of time to learn music-the theater companies I\u2019ve worked with usually want you off-book (everything committed to memory) as soon as possible, and the faster you learn, the less stressful the rehearsal periods are-while the director is hectoring all of the other singers who rely on rehearsals to get the music learned, you already have it. Plus, you get a good reputation for being able to learn quickly, which helps you get more work.I can play the accompanying piano parts so that I can hear what the instrumental parts are supposed to sound like and learn my cues- I don\u2019t have to wait for rehearsals to hear that. Being a classical pianist means I can play the majority of the music I have to learn, even opera/classical. This is particularly helpful for those cases when I\u2019m called back for musical theater roles, since for those the company will generally send out the music they want you to sing ahead of time and you don\u2019t get a lot of time to look it over and learn it. Instead of stressing out and wasting time finding a pianist to help me learn it, I can teach myself-I recently did just that for a callback for a role (that I did get)-I was able to show up already knowing the music. I have also found that I can take last minute auditions-a few days at the piano to review or make cuts to the music and work on it is all I need- I don\u2019t have to wait until my next vocal lesson or have to deal with finding a pianist at the last minute.I can communicate with pianists who play for me what it is I want them to do if I\u2019m performing a solo with them or auditioning. Since I speak their language and know the instrument myself, I can tell them exactly what I want them to do, and point specifically to changes in the music I want made. I know what they need to know in order to accompany me successfully, and can tell them in a way that is clear to them.I can duplicate the vocal exercises my teacher uses in my vocal lessons-which means I can progress faster since I can play the exercises and practice them on my own rather than only doing them when I\u2019m at my lesson.I can warm myself up if a piano is available at the venue I have to perform in-I don\u2019t have to wait for a pianist to show up.I would say that if you can get some piano under your belt, it will be a huge help. Most singers cannot play piano, so you are at a tremendous advantage if you can play, even at an intermediate level. The better you play, the bigger the dividends. I tell every kid who is taking singing lessons to take piano in parallel-they will be glad they did if they plan on making singing an important part of their lives. ",
