            "answer_text": "My friend\u2026 20 years old is REALLY young. Your life has barely begun! You can Google all sorts of examples of musicians who started late, but if you don\u2019t have the motivation you might just say, \u201cwell, they had music inside themselves all their life, but do I?\u201d So the examples are barely relevant. It\u2019s YOU who counts. You have barely even started. May 2016 - that\u2019s just two months. If you want to create (compose) electronic rock music it helps to be able to play rock style inside out and outside in, upside down and right side up - a process that never stops growing in a musician (or in any other specialty you wish to name).But here\u2019s the good part: even when you are a beginner, you can start fulfilling your dream, by starting to invent pieces of electronic music. I wrote a little music in college (age 18) in a music appreciation course. Just filled up pages with melodies - one line of notes, trying to make one line sound musical, comp;lete in itself, without trying to write some sort of symphony. Later, I got a tape recorder and just started playing into the thing and listening to what I had spontaneously created (which may be something like where you are heading). When my tape recorder got stolen I started writing down what I had written.If you\u2019re creating electronic music, you may have to invent ways to preserve it (unlike us old buzzards who did it the easy way, learning notes). Programs such as Audacity enable you to record anything that comes out of your guitar or keyboard (using a cord from its output), and you can record layer-on-layer. Music-writing programs such as Finale enable you to create sounds and actually put them on paper, though making a readable \u201cscore\u201d takes years of learning the art of music writing.I have a friend who is as resistant as Teflon to written music, but got a silly little free program for using a typewriter keyboard to enter notes - took him all night to write a few minutes of music - but before long, he was creating astonishing pieces of electronic music, just through experimentation and hours and hours of concerted effort. I myself, at the age of 48, got my first computer program for writing music, and it took me three HOURS to write just the melody of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and get the words badly placed below the notes. I recently, at the age of 68, completed a whole symphony. (note: 20 years in between).Musicians do not think of weeks or months to accomplish anything. Music is a lifetime. The great thing is, it keeps growing with you. I envied the athletes who got picked for the baseball team - it seemed the coach chose them just by looking at them! But now their knees are ruined and their bellies overlap their buckle, and maybe coach a little league outfit. As a musician, I am in constant demand, my outlook is young; learning music enables me to play with any kind of group, Swing, Latin, Russian, Jewish, Gospel, Nashville, Avant-Garde, Romantic, Pop - you name it. You might even end up inventing your own style. Put your guitar on the shelf, that won\u2019t happen. Pick it up today, pick it up tomorrow, the next day, and keep doing that day after day\u2026 now there, you have a life with the thing.There are some people who just don\u2019t have much talent (I\u2019ve been a teacher and director, and as much as I want to find the \u201chidden talent\u201d, yes\u2026 there are some whose talent is microscopic). But so much of music is about uncovering what is somewhere inside you, I wouldn\u2019t even worry about the talent issue. Just go for it, give it some time, good generous amounts of time, like years, and see where it leads you.",

            "answer_text": "Taken from an interview with Bill Withers, Withers was in his late twenties. His music-business experience consisted of sitting in a couple of times with a bar band while stationed in Guam in the Navy. He'd never played the guitar, but he headed to a pawn shop, bought a cheap one and began teaching himself to play. Between shifts at the factory, he began writing his own tunes. \"I figured out that you didn't need to be a virtuoso to accompany yourself,\" he says. He is a good example of someone who started playing guitar in his twenties, the guy is an incredible song writer and poet.I too started when I was 18, I have been all around the world playing and currently work as a community musician delivering music projects to those who need them the most. If you want to know more about community music get a copy of \u201cCommunity Music - In theory and in practice\u201d by Lee Higgins. An excellent academic detail of the subject. If you love music and want to do something with music as a professional then age is not going to be a barrier. Some would argue neither is talent. ",
