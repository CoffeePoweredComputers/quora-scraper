            "answer_text": "Although my stock answer to \u201cWhat kind of music do you like?\u201d really is \u201cEverything,\u201d with no genres excluded, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have preferences. If I\u2019m not limited by genre, here is how I determine what I most like to hear in music: High and/or variable volumeMid-tempo to fast tempoSyncopated, complex rhythmic pattern (I don\u2019t care what meter(s) it\u2019s in, as long as it\u2019s done convincingly, and with a logical pattern for the piece)Expansive melody in at least one part of a piece, enough to turn my head - i.e. wide intervals, strategic use of melodic motif manipulation, sequence and variation, or something utterly strangeVocals with excellent breath support, in any style - growling, clean, with vibrato or without, raspy and harsh, doesn\u2019t matter. Just as long as the vocals are bold, even when the vocalist occasionally sings softly for emotionality.Vocal harmonies, though I recognize that they\u2019re not appropriate everywhere. But solid, compatible vocal harmonies. Think Fleetwood Mac, The Temptations, Georgia Mass Choir, The Pointer Sisters, or Pain of Salvation (the first six albums).Distortion. On guitars, on basses, on organs, just distortion on all of the amplified instruments. But not all the time.Deep, heavy, bold bass.Dramatic string, woodwind, choral, and brass arrangements.Creative use of found, orchestral, or any culture\u2019s traditional percussion.Use of instruments from mixed cultures (but done tastefully, not in a way that smacks of cultural appropriation)Dissonance (but not all the time). I like my dissonance with a liberal dose of consonance, rather than consonance with a light dose of dissonance.Use of fugue, canticle, round, variation, and other potentially layered polyphony.Surprise.Cavernous reverb and big sound.Musical references and musical humor (using melody, harmony, and rhythm to make cultural reference jokes).Musical illustrations of lyrics (literal interpretations).Anticipation and delayed attack. The very heart of funk.Synthesizers and electronic beats (but the biggest sounds possible).As for why I like these things, I\u2019ve determined that it\u2019s because of my overall sensory sensitivity. My senses are either heightened or lowered in comparison to other people, but when it comes to my hearing, I hear in color. I mean that quite literally; I have synesthesia. And I don\u2019t just hear in color. I hear in pictures, movies, stories, physical sensations. The word frisson comes to mind. The more is happening sonically, the more I see and feel, and the more I am capable of feeling emotion, in turn. I am a sensation-seeker. Sometimes, seeking these stronger sensations can help distract me from other distressing sensations I\u2019m experiencing. Or sometimes they keep my mind from stumbling over itself in a loop, or going off in a million directions. Music keeps me focused - on the music, at least. On that one, maybe two to five things, rather than thirty things. Rather than obsessing or worrying or whatever it was I was going to do instead. As far as genres, if you still want that answer: should follow that my default favorite genres are metal, rock, country, hip-hop, dance/EDM, and house techno, based on the list above. That\u2019s extremely general, and leaves out every other genre in which there are things I love, but those genres tend to combine most of the aesthetics I\u2019m seeking all in one place. ",

            "answer_text": "Music is my absolute passion along with books & film, but if I was to choose one out of the three it would have to be music. I pretty much listen to alll different kinds of music which ranges from rock to classical and I go through stages listening to different types of bands of all genres sometimes for months at a time like I just went the last few months listening to The Stones & now I\u2019m going through a Radiohead phase & maybe next it\u2019ll be something completely different like reggae, Marley, Peter Tosh, Augustus Pablo, Lee Perry, or an electronic phase, The Orb, Kraftwerk, Massive Attack, or an alternative phase, My Bloody Valentine, The Pixies, Dinosaur Jnr, Spacemen 3/Spiritualised, Galaxy 500, Sonic Youth, Primal Scream or maybe something from the 60\u2019s/70\u2019s like The Beatles(my all time favourite band, I\u2019m from Liverpool so it has to be) or The Who, The Stones, Zeppelin, Floyd, Hendrix, Dylan etc, & how about some cool sounding soul & funk from the likes of Marvin Gaye or The Family stone or Curtis Mayfield & Prince, Funkadelic. Music resonates with something deep within my very essence that just makes me feel alive & that\u2019s why it\u2019s my absolute passion. I can\u2019t think of anything better than to seethe back at the start of a really great album & to prepare to experience something truly wonderful & special. ",

Why? because those are the ones that resonate with me more than any other. Why? because Metal got me through tough times and made me have a better understanding on certain things. My perspective on things changed. Also also, it kind of in a way made me more intimidating. I\u2019ve been in the metal scene since i was 8, i am now 30. Back in the days, at that time, at the school i was in, i was the only Metalhead. I was that weird kid, always dressed in black, talking to no one, in his own dark little world. Of course, people were intimidated by that. In other words, no one tried to fuck with me. So yeah, being a Metalhead has its perks. Of course people would shout things and say things and make rumors, but touch me? wouldn\u2019t fucking dare.  ",
