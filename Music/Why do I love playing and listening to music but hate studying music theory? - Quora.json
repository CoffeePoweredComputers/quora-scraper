            "answer_text": "Sadly we aren\u2019t trained to hear music theory. We only learn it on paper and that makes us wonder how useful it really is. Since music is a hearing art, can anyone say they know theory if they can\u2019t identify it by ear, or more importantly use it for themselves? Knowing music theory. I mean REALLY knowing music theory actually makes everything so much easier to organize and see patterns and phrases. Instead of thinking of several individual notes you can see chords and then familiar progressions that let you group parts into an understandable whole. One part of the problem is we don\u2019t always get to that level (especially not me) and often all the paper exercises doesn\u2019t train us in a way to connect what we can see on paper to what we would hear. The other part of the problem I think is that school tends to make theory more like exercises where we are either right or wrong it feels like copying by rote instead of actually learning. I still recommend you stick with it. It is fascinating when you learn to make more connections and can explain why you like something. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say because music theory is very technical. You have all the notes to learn, symbols to decipher as you\u2019re playing, counting common time signatures like 4/4, and playing crazy ones like 21/8, which is you doing math, etc. It gets difficult and it can be boring when all you want to do is play. I hated music theory too. Its very possible to be self taught but if you are trying to get a job in music industry/music education, etc, you usually gotta know the technical stuff. But once you get it, a lot of doors open for you. ",
