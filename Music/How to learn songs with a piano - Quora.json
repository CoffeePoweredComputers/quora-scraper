            "answer_text": "Your question is not quite clear, but I will assume that you are a singer who wants to make use of a piano to learn your songs. Play the melody on the piano, then sing along. If you play well enough to play the accompaniment, add that as soon as you are sure of singing the melody accurately. Do not sing the lyrics. then, try singing the lyrics as you play just the melody, as you did at the beginning When that is solid, do it all together. finally, get someone else to play while you sing. If, on the other hand you are a would-be pianist, then to learn your pieces (we call them \u201cpieces\u201d, not \u201csongs\u201d), you have two choices. either learn to read notation and study the piece note by note, or hunt and peck, using your ears, at the keyboard until you find the right notes, then memorize them in the right order.
