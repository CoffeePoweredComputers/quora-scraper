            "answer_text": "I agree with David Virgil\u2019s answer - as quickly as you can play it the way you want it. But that being said, it depends on what you\u2019re recording and how much work you\u2019ll put it in to making it sound \u201cperfect\u201d (whatever that means to you). Think about the Beatles. Their first album was recorded in about 14 hours - that\u2019s it - for the entire album. They recorded everything live, played it in just a few takes, then on to the next song. But for Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band, that\u2019s several months in the making, organizing the orchestral parts, overdubbing the various sounds and instruments. So a band who knows their songs and can perform it in-studio well can be in and out in just a few hours. But if they want to layer a ton of instrumentation or samples overtop of their performance, add overdubs of other instruments, or simply can\u2019t play to a click track or get nervous in the studio, they should expect to be there a while. Also, if the band is a simple set up, i.e. guitar/bass/drums and one of them sings, as long as they\u2019re rehearsed before going in, it should be pretty easy. But if you have multiple musicians or people who are in and out (play on this song, not on that song), it may take a lot longer to nail down the sound you\u2019re looking for. ",

Listen to this - he dropped the needle on Harvest! That was it for me!! I listened to the whole album twice - Old Man, out on the Weekend, Harvest, Needle and the Damage Done, Alabama, \u2026. On my first listen, that voice!! Hypnotic, Maybe the first moment was how his voice broke singing the sun in tge song Harvest, as in As the days fly past will we lose our grasp Or fuse it in the Sun Ahh I was a fan right away. After that only listened to Neil for a decade or more. Wow what else you got?? He put on After the Gold Rush!! Oh my God!! The acoustic guitar on Tell me Why!! Play it Again Sam!!! ",

            "answer_text": "They can produce one at any time. There are so many recording studios these days you can simply make an appointment and go in to record. I do it all the time. It is much easier to record these days than it was 30 years ago since most studios now use digital recording as opposed to tape that was used years ago. Generally it cost between $45 -$55 an hour to record. Now promoting an album is a different story but producing an album is easy. ",
