            "answer_text": "The short answer is that it\u2019s not wrong. You can give yourself any name you want. I cannot be sure that the rest of this answer applies to you, but let\u2019s presume your family no longer know where in Africa they have ancestral links \u2014 meaning they did not migrate recently. One of the crimes committed against people forced from Africa, is the severing of cultural links. What is unhelpful is that modern Africa is so different from just a century ago. That makes it harder to establish links, even if the ancestral research could be completed. In my view, when migrant children/grandchildren are no longer learning the language and culture of their parents/grandparents there is no longer an active link to past country. They are culturally linked to the present country, even if that\u2019s unfair. This can best be compensated by going to a country in Africa and building up some cultural experience. You may need to guess which country to choose, but I doubt people will care. The experiences will give you great insights, and you will have an active link to somewhere closer to your ancestors, than now. Keep in mind, it will be secondary to the culture of your home town, state and country, but you may find your real African name in the most genuine way possible. ",

            "answer_text": "I applaud your interest in your roots. The traditional way \u201cAfrican\u201d names are chosen is very specific- bear in mind that there is no such thing as an \u201cAfrican\u201d name, as Africa is a continent comprised of many many cultures, traditions, languages and nuances. If you really want to be authentic in your choice, research your lineage and then names from that particular region. Traditionally names will tell a story about the person, their family, their birth position in the family, the day they were born, the prayers for and expectations of. I would love to know what name you choose! Be well x ",
