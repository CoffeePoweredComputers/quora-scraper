            "answer_text": "Have you heard P. D. Q. Bach\u2019s Pervertimento for bag pipes, bicycle, and garden hose? Don\u2019t miss the Minuet for an example of bag pipes playing a violin line. It\u2019s really something. In J. S. Bach\u2019s Toccata and Fugue in D-Minor, the theme of the fugue seems pretty obviously composed for the pedal board of the organ. Using two feet, it\u2019s a natural. Also, on an organ one would configure the pedal part in octaves\u20148-foot plus 16-foot, or maybe 16-foot plus 32-foot pipes. Try it with one hand on the piano, however, in octaves\u2014not so easy! Organ pieces, in general, seem very hard to reproduce on a piano. There are some pretty piano arrangements of Cesar Franck\u2019s Prelude, Fugue, and Variation originally for organ, but\u2014at least in my hands\u2014none of them capture the sense of serenity\u2014majestic but gentle\u2014of the organ. Guitar chords in popular music are, perhaps because of how its strings are tuned, voiced with a 4th in the bass and sometimes with another 4th above that. An easy way to play an A7 chord on the guitar begins with a low E (the lowest string of the instrument), then the open A string, then another E played in the D string, the open G string, a C# on the B string, and the open E string on top. (I can barely play the guitar, and, maybe this isn\u2019t at all the natural or easiest way to play this chord on the guitar\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to give false information, but, I\u2019m sure that in general guitar chords are often voiced in this kind of way.). So, if you\u2019d like to accompany yourself playing John Lennon\u2019s Julia on the piano, you may find that it sounds more like the original if you voice your accompaniment according to the layout of the guitar strings (and more or less centered in octave below Middle C). In the simplest of cases, think of the development section of Schubert\u2019s Unfinished Symphony\u2014those mournful, sustained clarinet notes. A singer or a wind player or even a string player can sustain a single note for a long time. They can all sing. Can you do this with a guitar or a piano? (You can do it with an electric guitar, however! I\u2019ve heard an electric guitar that sounds at times like a trumpet.) Quiet, sustained string chords are similarly difficult to render on a piano, such as in accompaniment to operas. Quiet, tremolo string chords are also difficult to render, perhaps surprisingly\u2014one might thing that piano tremolo would do it, and, maybe in the hands of better players than I it succeeds, but, I cannot get that quiet, slight dryness of the string tremolo. Pieces by Bach seem to survive transcription pretty well (except for things like the organ pedal parts, perhaps). There\u2019s something infinitely adaptable built in to that music. But, everything has its limits. I wouldn\u2019t care to hear the C-Major first Prelude from The Well-Tempered Clavier played on the bag pipes. ",

            "answer_text": "One example that readily comes to mind is playing rags on a simple instrument like a recorder versus a more advanced instrument like a clarinet. I played rags on my alto recorder with my mother on the piano and found it very challenging because rag composers love accidentals and my recorder music had a plethora of them. The recorder lacks the keys and alternative fingerings of more advanced woodwinds like the clarinet and oboe (I know because I also play clarinet and oboe) to help facilitate awkward passages. But challenges are always fun. I also think it is easier to improvise on the cornet or trumpet than an instrument like the clarinet and violin which has so many intricate fingerings with which to contend, whereas on the cornet or trumpet there are only three valves or buttons that stand between your mental processing and actualizing music. I haven\u2019t read this anywhere but just base it on my own experience in playing the instruments. Also on any song the oboe is more difficult especially in the middle range than a clarinet, because the clarinet has an orderly intuitive fingering progression whereas the oboe skips around on what should be the intuitive progression of notes, especially with the Bflat, B, C, plus you have the infamous slide between half holes on a few notes in the middle range right above that which keep you continuously slipping and sliding around so to speak. But, like I said before, challenges are fun and make life interesting. ",
