            "answer_text": "As a counter-example, I\u2019ll name a group that was leader-less, but had to add one.  This was U-KISS (Dongho, Eli, Kevin, Kibum, Soohyun and Xander) back in 2008, when they just debuted. They were a group with a youthful image and didn\u2019t have a leader. The company added another member (Kiseop) later in the year, and that lineup remained for two years. In 2011, their company announced that the members Kibum, who \u201cwanted to focus on his acting career\u201d, and Xander, who had \u201cpersonal reasons, mainly his studies\u201d, \u201cdecided\u201d to suspend their contracts. Notice the quotes? Those former members revealed they were forced to end their contracts so the group could have two more members.  (Hoon, Kiseop, Eli, Soohyun, Kevin, Dongho and AJ) This naturally caused inestability whithin the group, distrust in the company, paranoia and miscommunication. Soohyun, the eldest and most experienced member was appointed as the leader as a way to manage this situation. From that point onwards, he became a pillar in the group, mainly for internal communication within the group and to the company (as it\u2019s normally a leader\u2019s duty). Now, after many years, another new member (Jun in 2014), suspended contracts, actually leaving for studying, marriages, children, a divorce, a survival show, not renewed contracts, and military service, Soohyun is the only original member left in a three member lineup (Soohyun, Hoon, Jun). Thanks to social media, though, we know that many of the members are in good terms. ",
