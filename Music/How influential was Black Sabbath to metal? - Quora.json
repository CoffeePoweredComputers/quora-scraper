            "answer_text": "Aesthetically, they were obviously a huge driving force for the genre, as were a bunch of other bands buried under the success of Sabbath such as Wicked Lady and Coven. Thy created a sound with massive sounding guitar riffs and an \u201coff\u201d vibe, serious groove and a lot of times, slower tempos. The genres Stoner Metal, Doom Metal and Sludge essentially are worship genres to what Black Sabbath released in their early days up until their Sabotage album. In terms of the sound, it started to develop ever since The Kinks wrote You Really Got Me where the guitarist slashed his speakers to get a distorted sound (mind you, this was at a time when distortion wasn\u2019t a favorable quality and the amplifiers were designed to not distort at loud volumes.). The sound was further innovated by legends such as including Jimi Hendrix, Paul McCartney and Keith Richards. The introduction of fuzz pedals greatly sped up the progression of this sound. As for their influence on heavy metal, I\u2019d attribute that to Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Motorhead, and Black Sabbath equally. The attitude, speed and in Black Sabbath\u2019s case, the tri-tone basically forged what eventually became known as heavy metal. But on a personal note, Judas Priest is a biggest influence on what traditional heavy metal eventually became. ",
