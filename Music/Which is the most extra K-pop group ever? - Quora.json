Only BTOB knows how to be this extra. And look at the visual of the group. Sungjae is one of the weirdest (in a good way ofcourse) and the most hilarious kpop idols I know! And not just Sungjae. All of them know how to be extra! For instance:   LMAO I just can\u2019t with these boys- Here\u2019s a bonus incase you want to laugh a little more:)  BTOB are amazing vocalists, visuals and pretty talented. Also they are the actual representation of a walking meme! HONOURABLE MENTIONS: BTS GOT7 SUPER JUNIOR SHINee Girls\u2019 Generation (and more\u2026) Have a good day:) EDIT: This is an answer to who is the most extra kpop group ever. Quora merged the original question with \u2018Who is the most famous kpop group?\u2019 ",
