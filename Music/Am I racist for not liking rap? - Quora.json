            "answer_text": "If you dislike it simply because you can\u2019t connect with the lyrics, or you think the music itself is too harsh, or its too fast, or the synths want to make you sick, or it's too repetitive, that\u2019s fine. If you don\u2019t like it because simply because of the music, that is in no way shape or form racist. I am not the biggest fan of metal, some songs I like, however, many I don\u2019t. If you dislike the culture surrounding rap, that is also fine. I dislike the imagery that surrounds the lyrics of most rap songs, getting girls, making money. I find it to be obscene and vulgar. However, when I find a rap song that doesn\u2019t focus on these sorts of things, I like it more, because it has detached itself from the culture that has attached itself to rap. You\u2019re allowed to have your opinions. No one can change them. If you dislike the music, simply for the music, that\u2019s fine. Simply put, just avoid the music. And which race would you be racist against for disliking rap? In the 1980\u2019s, when rap was first gaining momentum, it was seen as \u201cblack music\u201d, just as in the same way Jazz had been in the 1930\u2019s. This was because rap originated in African American culture. The main \u201crace\u201d of rap, was people of colour. However, this has changed. One of the best selling rap artists of all time, Eminem, has discussed this multiple times in his earlier songs, discussing how that people thought he shouldn\u2019t rap because he was white. Dr Dre summed it up perfectly: \u201cI don't give a f*ck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you.\u201d That was 16/17 years ago. Rap has changed massively in that time, it nearly doubled its lifespan as a genre since it was first accepted into the mainstream as a form of music in the 1980\u2019s. It\u2019s difficult to now pin down a certain race as being the main race of rap because there are now so many people from so many ethnic groups who rap. It is now much more culturally diverse and has developed its own culture. For not liking rap, are you being racist to all these different races? If you go out your way and say: \u201cI hate rap. It's black music, and is below me\u201d, yes that can be seen as both racist and offensive. But you just don\u2019t like it because of how it sounds? Is that racist? The answer: No. Not at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember rap from the very first rap song\u2014\"Rappers Delight\" by The Sugar Hill Gang. It was a groundbreaking, cultural phenomenon in 1979 (or thereabouts). It was a catchy, unique, and fun song, with lyrics that featured a mix of good-natured self aggrandizement, and entertaining storytelling. Rap continued to grow for the next decade, or so, adding themes of cultural awareness to the mix. At some point, someone whose name I cannot recall released a song about a loose girl entitled \"Roxanne, Roxanne,\" followed closely by a similarly themed song named \"Veronica, Veronica.\" Rap had officially entered its \"whore phase.\" Copious amounts of songs that were denigrating to women soon flooded the genre. I had recently been turned on to Sting and The Police, at the time, so I consider myself fortunate that my consciousness had somewhere else to go. A few rap artists of substance arose, but while rap mostly pandered to the lowest common denominator\u2014deteriorating into simple, repetitive, patterns and themes of violence, and drug use\u2014my attention went full-time to rock and guitar music. Today, that which I hear of the hip hop genre is (for the most part) completely unintelligible\u2026 I'm not exaggerating. It sounds like pure audio garbage, scraped from the bottom of a barrel of ignorance. If dislike of that tripe constitutes racism, I'm ready for my first cross-burning. ",

Then your dislike of rap is likely not racial in nature.  ",
