            "answer_text": "Definitely! There\u2019s no age limit that companies are imposing on the trainees that they accept, so why not? Take Kang Hyewon from IZ*ONE, for example. She was around 19 when she debuted in IZ*ONE. Her company stated that her official training period with them was 9 months, meaning that she was probably around the same age as you when she got accepted. So go for it, and good luck! ",
