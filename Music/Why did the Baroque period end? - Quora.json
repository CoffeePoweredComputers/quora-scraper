            "answer_text": "That any art period has a beginning and an end is largely an invention of critics and art historians. The Baroque era was named by 18th century aesthetes and critics who wanted to celebrate the restoration of classicism in their era and therefore maligned what they saw as excessive and vulgar in 17th century art: the excessive realism, theatrical expression, and extreme effects of light and color. It was left up to later generations of art historians to decide when the Baroque actually go underway and at what point you could determine that it was decisively over. This is all a little silly, of course. The succession of movements and styles is rather like the crashing of waves on a beach. Each rises, falls, flows, ebbs, partly in sequence, partly simultaneously. In any case, the water itself is constant. As I suggest to my students, the ideas that constitute the structure of a moment emerge, grow, develop critical mass. At that point the focus of the artists involved changes from trying to accomplish particular aesthetic goals (like capturing the transience of light through daubs of pure color, as the Impressionists did) and the techniques involved simply become another group of tools in the toolbox that can be used to achieve any number of ends. In terms of this example, Impressionist technique was applied by Symbolist, Expressionist and later artists, long after \u201cImpressionism\u201d in any sense that it was a project shared by Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Pissarro et al. Baroque art was born in the conflict of the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation and the approach was articulated in one of the documents to emerge from the Council of Trent in 1563. So you could establish the emergence of Baroque art, inasmuch as the artist was following the dictates of the Counter-Reformation, in the fourth quarter of the 16th century. Most people identify the Baroque with the 17th century. There is ongoing argument as to whether the Rococo in the 18th century is a movement or merely a late manifestation of the Baroque. All of which means I worry very little about the precise dimensions of the box any wants to stuff any art thing into. ",

            "answer_text": "Periods are determined in hindsight. There are no definitive events which pinpoint the actual period but rather a series of events which can mark a change in the zeitgeist and historians can mark those periods. Just like you can\u2019t look back in time and tell me the exact date or year you learned to read. It happened incrementally and cumulatively. You can cite that it was probably during your elementary years. Then when you take Latin in HS you may determine that to be the period of awakening to vocabulary. Then when you retire you may take up reading and that too is a new period of your literary journey. There are no specific dates to each enlightenment but looking back, you can see each evolution. We can see in hindsight several events which ended the Baroque Period. Equal temperament became the norm. Bach died. The industrial revolution began. There was an economic boom. Even before Bach\u2019s death, there were signs that the Classical Period was beginning. Bach and his music fell out of favor. Even his own kids thought his music was banal, fuddy duddy and old fashioned. His music was considered \u201cbombastic and confused\u201d unlike the more refined and orchestral music that was emerging. He died poor, in a plain donated coffin and buried in an unmarked grave. His remains were not honored until 150 years later where in hindsight, we could delineate his importance. Hence, his death is now marked as the end of the Baroque period. But really, it was long coming with no concrete \u201ceureka\u201d moment. ",
