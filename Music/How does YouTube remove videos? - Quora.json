In that case, the material is copyrighted, and you need permission to incorporate it into any of your videos. You have no right to upload a video containing copyrighted material. Youtube has been sued in the past over copyright infringement. You may be able to use audio and visual editing software to create monetizable content, but this depends on the scope, limitations, and commercial permissions of the license. If you have used samples or loops, make sure that the license specifically allows for their commercial use. ",

            "answer_text": "rewboss said: Actually, it's no secret. The video remains on the servers, but completely inaccessible to the public, and YouTube's TOS state that YouTube will not use that video for anything. There's always the possibility that the video could in future be reinstated (e.g. as the result of a successful copyright counter claim), or law enforcement agencies may obtain a court order as part of a criminal investigation -- for example. The relevant clause is in the TOS, section 6C: \"You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of User Submissions that have been removed or deleted.\" ",
