            "answer_text": "Totally infringing. You seem to be aiming at the fair use exception to copyright. But you don't know all of the criteria of fair use. Let me start by saying that you can claim your use is fair, but only analysis by a judge will officially make it fair use. That is, fair use is a defensein court, not a shield to being sued by the content owner. Now, the rules: Using the minimal amount needed. You seem to know this one, given your use of ten second pieces. There is no exact number! It is judged along with all other factors.Significant addition. You have to create a workof your own, which then incorporates the borrowed content. And you content must be about the original content.Fitting one of the few purposes allowed: parody, review or criticism of the original. Or academic use. Your stated use fails this completely.No commercial harm to the original owner, such as unpaid licencing fees.",
