You can connect to people, places and animals, inanimate things as possessions, dreams and feelings totally intangible, memories of them all (living or dead) on a level that only you may understand. Quantifying it will only put you in predicament of comparative study through analogies of preposterous proportions (though at times... funny).  Look at the genre it is most complex and vivid almost creating niches as times progress. I mean you really have to have a natural knack for it as immediately it doesn't paste a great welcoming picture. I remember back in the early 90s when MTV played some real music there were metal bands on and I was just a kid in my primary school I saw big men with big hair playing incredibly fast and head banging to it. For a child like me it was a horrendous experience. It scared me to think there were people out there who made such stuff and came on to telly, more so that there were people who enjoyed it. It was one of the biggest WTF moment of my life. Its like horns effect (opposite of halo) for outsiders (people who not into metal). Sex, Drugs and Rock n' Roll doesn't help either (but who's worried about that?) and that would create a general rift with people who would be... Lets say a bit judgemental or even worried as to what you are doing with your life (ahem' parents). Until I grew a brain. I seriously got in metal when I was 17 (29 now) and I thought I could understand and laud the complex structure and appreciate the sheer poetry of lyrics (i am not a musician in any way nor can I play any instrument... Yet) that was lacking to say the least in most contemporary/mainstream music. I \"connected\" to metal and my love is going strong ever since.  What most people fail to understand is that musicians especially in metal are highly qualified and educated people, they are intellectuals and have an objective outlook to the world. But we aren't justifying anything or our leaning towards a particular kind of music. Metal is for outcasts and people who don't conform to everyday spoon-feeding of bullshit. Its for primeval passion and knowledge that the beast is best untamed but decisive and focused. Unchained but righteous.  There's just this one problem... Too many bands, not enough time.

            "answer_text": "Metal is capable of producing a wide range of emotions utilizing a wide range of speeds and technicality. It's incredibly diverse but that's just one reason I love it. It sounds like you probably just enjoy the aesthetic of the instrumentation first and foremost. I deeply enjoy the sound of electric guitar and distortion, as well as double bass drums. Vocals vary, but many are fantastic. You can find a combination that fits for you fairly easily. I enjoy the speed of it. The energy. The unfiltered emotion and the raw sense of power. I love the poeticism, the razor edge of topics and themes. I love the darkness-- you don't find that in other genres easily. It's a wondrous world. ",
