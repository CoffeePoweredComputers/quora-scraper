But if I had to choose, Soompi seems more reliable. allKpop, like most journalists these days, over do things and make something look twenty times worse than it is. Or they\u2019ll make you think something bad happened with an article title. Pure stupidity if you ask me. ",

I understand the appeal of Allkpop as it will have more articles about groups than soompi, but I refuse to support a website that helped in falsely ruining idol's reputations and is biased towards/ against certain groups.
