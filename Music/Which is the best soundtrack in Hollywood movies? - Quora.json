            "answer_text": "Well that actually depends on your taste buds and palatability for music and for the type of movies too. I'm a kind of person who can listen to any kind n genre of music, just depends on my mood. My music choice ranges from hard core Indian classical to heavy metal songs.  I'll just mention a few notable soundtracks that I simply adore.  First n foremost has to be the matrix. The first movie had music by various rock bands n it was absolutely awesome. This was the first ost that I'd bought.The subsequent 2 movies had as background, trans by Juno Reactor which was actually passable.Definitely maybe- now I sincerely don't remember the entire collection, but I came across the song come as you are by nirvana via this movie. do I need to say more.500 days of summer- each n every song is awesome.Bandslam- again absolutely adorable tracks. Infanct this one movie enlightened me that rock music can be great too(although I adored matrix soundtrack from almost 10 years before this apparition).Mean girlsDevil wears Prada - has some beautiful tracks like Vogue by Madonna and Our remains by Bitter Sweet(I'm truly indebted to SoundHound app for this one).Django unchained.The chef.Music and lyrics- man how can I miss this one.Slumdog millionaire.Many other rom-coms like noting hill, pretty woman, runaway bride, PS I love you, you've got mail have all got great music.
