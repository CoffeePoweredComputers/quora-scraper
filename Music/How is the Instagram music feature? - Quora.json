            "answer_text": "Instagram\u2019s users can add music to their stories. This feature is not available for posts, unfortunately. If you are among those who have access to this feature in the official app, just add the sticker \u201cMusic\u201d to the video or photo. The library works by mood, genre, and popularity; there is a preliminary listening. Once you have selected a song, you can rewind it and select the desired part. You can add music before choosing a video: open the camera, scroll to the right and select the \u201cMusic\u201d item under the record button. Find a song, select the desired fragment and record a video while the song is playing in the background.  Now the function is available in the updated version of the application in a number of countries, it will soon become available to all users. To do this, you must have Instagram v110.0.0.16.119. If the \u201cMusic\u201d sticker in the official application does not work, you can add music using video editors: StorybeatInShotVivaVideoThere is an opinion that it is easier to broadcast compositions to iPhone owners. The chronology is as follows: Open the player;Turn on the melody;Record story without turning off the composition;Put it on the network.Android holders can perform similar actions. Just launch songs through Play Music on Android. Next, shoot a mini-movie, revealing stories, as with the apple device. But you must admit, such a method does not look convenient. If you need instructions on Instagram Music then feel free to ask me on Quora. I will provide you a guide on how to use it with SoundCloud. ",
