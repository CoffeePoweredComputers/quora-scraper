            "answer_text": "A synthesizer is an electronic device for creating and modifying sounds. Types of synthesizers vary from the traditional analog units, to digitally controlled, pure digital and more recently software emulation. I am providing a much longer answer below that expands on what makes up an analog synthesizer and how it works. To explain a synthesizer, you have to first talk a bit about sound and how traditional instruments work.  Sound is made up of vibrations that cause rapid fluctuations in air pressure.  When these vibrations (rarefaction and compression of air) fluctuate between a frequency of 20 Hz and 20 kHz, our eardrums pick up these rapid fluctuations and we perceive them as sound.  When you strum a guitar or strike a piano key, a string rapidly vibrates producing a sound.  The faster it vibrates, the higher the pitch. The harder we strike or strum the string, the louder the sound.  If we anchor that string to another structure made of a material that can pick up these vibrations (such as a guitar body or piano soundboard or \"Harp\"), it will amplify the sound by vibrating along with the string and introduce it's own tonal qualities from the wood, metal or membrane (like a drum head). Around the turn of the last century, with the advent of electronics and radio, advances were made in amplifying and transmitting sound through transducers.  A transducer is a device for converting mechanical energy into electronic signals and back again (microphones and speakers).  A guitar pick-up is a transducer just as a record player needle and a microphone.   A synthesizer replaces the first transducer (ex: guitar pick-up) with an electronic sound source that \"synthesizes\" the vibrations that would have been produced by a guitar string or other source.  This new sound source was called an \"oscillator\" which is the fundamental first building block of an electronic sound synthesizer.  The oscillator \"oscillates\" rapidly generating electronic pulses.  Increasing the voltage raises the pitch so this kind of oscillator became known as a Voltage Controlled Oscillator of VCO for short.  It is the sound source but you cannot hear it yet. To hear our voltage controlled oscillator, we need to amplify the current to a level that will work with our output transducer (The speaker cabinet) that does the work of converting the electrical energy back to mechanical energy (sound). So the second building block of a synthesizer becomes the \"Amplifier\".  Voltage is use to control the volume or amplitude of the amplifier so this device became known as a Voltage Controlled Amplifier of VCA. With a VCO and a VCA, you have a basic synthesizer and could do a lot of cool stuff with it but it would not lend itself well to a wide range of sounds or easily create music. So the next most important component becomes the \"Controller\" or \"In Put Device\".  Most of the time, the controller is a standard keyboard borrowing from piano and organ design but a controller can be drum triggers, breath controllers (ex. flute or saxophone style device), microphone (ex. vocoder)  or some kind of interface to software or hardware sequencer (midi, cv or usb). Now you can rapidly play your synthesized tones like any other musical instrument. These synthesized tones are limited so the next group of components that were added to synthesizers are known as \"Modifiers\".  Modifiers allow the synthesist or musician to affect the sound in ways that are analogous to natural sounds. Here's a short list of modifiers used on \"analog\" synthesizers. Wave Forms: Modifies or shapes the voltage fluctuations of the VCO in regards to amplitude and duration of the oscillation.  Common wave forms are Square Wave (nasal flute and wood marimba qualities), Sine or S Wave (smoother string quality), Saw Tooth (brassy quality) and Triangle Wave (somewhere between string and brass). Filters: The filter is a kind of tone control that adjusts bass and treble qualities of a sound.  Filter controls are typically frequency, resonance and sometimes additionally called timbre, cut-off, brilliance, presence, range depending on the manufacturer.   Envelopes: The envelope is like a fancy volume control that shapes the sound over the duration of play.  Envelopes modify either the amplitude (volume) or filter qualities.  An envelope is typically made up of Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release controls. Attack is the first part of the sound ( a drum or piano has no attack but a flute or string sound has a slower or longer attack).  Decay is the decrease of the volume or filter after the peak of the attack.  Sustain is the eventual landing point where the sound will maintain after Attack and Decay, and will continue until Release (after the key is let up).  Release is the duration of the sound that can follow after releasing a key on the controller. Modulation: A tremolo or vibrato that can be added to the pitch, filter or amplitude of the sound.  Modulation is controlled by a separate \"Low Frequency Oscillator\" or LFO that oscillates at a frequency too slow to produce sound.  Instead it is used to rapidly raise and lower the pitch, brightness (filter) or volume (amplifier) of the sound to add more character. When all these modifiers were added, musicians now needed a way to use them effectively while playing or \"performing\" so Performance Controllers were added to synthesizers.  These most often are pitch benders, modulators and octave controls in the form of wheels, toggles, sliders or switches that are located next to the keyboard or other controller interface so they are easily accessed while playing. That is the definition and fundamental description of a basic analog synthesizer used for producing sounds and playing music and will help to distinguish the difference between an electric piano or organ and what is considered a synthesizer.  There are many, many other variations and flavors of synthesis that go into FM Synthesis, Digitally Controlled Oscillators, Digital Synthesizers, Samplers, etc... but that is a whole other story.

            "answer_text": "The short answer:Synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through your speakers or headphones. You can produce the sound of your desire by manipulating filters such as pitch, velocity, pulse, tone, and many more. Synthesizers might vary but the signal path from \u201cOscillator\u201d to \u201cFilter\u201d and then \u201cAmp\u201d is always the same. Start with the base waveform (Sine, Square, Triangle etc.) that is generated in the Oscillator and then into a filter to shape your sound with boosting or cutting frequencies. Last destination at the Amp section to give extra modification with Reverb, Echo, Delay and many other audio effects. Synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that consists of several different modules which work together to produce a synthesized sound or recreate an instrument. In other words, you can create your own sounds and compose electronic music with that one tool.
