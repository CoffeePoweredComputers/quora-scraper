            "answer_text": "In my opinion, based upon my own experience, the cello has a more \u201cnatural\u201d playing posture. After spending two decades as a professional brass player (including service in a Washington, DC military band - regarded as one of the top positions for wind players), I decided to pursue a career as a conductor. After beginning my conducting studies, I rapidly found out that I really needed to know string technique - intimately - so I could help the less-than-professional members of the orchestras I would initially be allowed to conduct. The bass was just too damn big to lug around. And I found that, in my undergraduate \u201cclass violin\u201d classes (a music education major requires you to be able to play all the instruments to an elementary level in order to be able to teach them), that the left arm position with the elbow cranked \u2018way over to the right was more than uncomfortable - it was downright painful for me. Perhaps it\u2019s like the ballet dancers - they have to start when they are little girls in order to get the \u201cturnout\u201d of their feet. It is very difficult to achieve that after they have grown. Also, I never did get the hang of vibrato (rapid variation of pitch used for expressive purposes) on the violin/viola. It involves a \u201cwiggle\u201d of the hand and finger that was beyond me. The cello, on the other hand, has (to me) a very natural playing position with no stressed arms. And the vibrato movement, which involves the entire arm, came to me with no problems whatsoever. (As a final inducement, the range of the cello is similar to the euphonium/trombone which I had already achieved professional abilities on). So for me (and I must emphasize this) the cello was easier and more rewarding. But remember that this was a personal judgement and not necessarily applicable to everyone. In music, as in everything else, there is no \u201cOne size fits all\u201d! ",
