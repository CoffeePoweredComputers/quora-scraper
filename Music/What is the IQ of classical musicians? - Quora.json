            "answer_text": "what do you mean? as in classical composers? surely some are genius, some are not. Either way you dont exactly need to be a genius to compose or play music. As in every field you have hacks, innovators, any and all ranges of people. Im not sure how to answer this because i dont know what this question even means, and Im sure there isnt an average statistic (how would you even go about measuring that? by age? by decade? by instrument?) either way, people put way too much emphasis on IQ tests. Having a high IQ doesnt mean youll know how to make something that will be great, and theres many different forms of intelligence, usually artists (actors, musicians, painters) seem to me to be more in the Emotional Intelligence are than having a sort of precise calculative mind, especially musicians. Those sort of super thinkers, analytical, with sharp cognition tend to fall into government/science work I assume\u2026. Working with computers\u2026 other precise fields (though you can always find Stanley Kubricks or Frank Zappas sprinkled among the arts) This is just my guess. being a musician and all ",

A John Carrick points out below, an appreciation of classical music is associated with high intelligence in general. So children of high IQ parents are more likely to be exposed to classical music, and because high IQ parents tend to be prosperous, they are more likely to take music lessons. I think, too, that because the field is so competitive, those who actually establsih careers as classical musicians tend to be extremely gifted musically, and that has a positive correlation with a high IQ (see the discussion of auditory working memory here a while back).

There is one interesting comment on those who *enjoy* classical music though. \u201cLike Mozart or Mahler, researcher Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics and Political Science takes a few imaginative leaps to arrive at his conclusion. His latest paper, just published in the Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, may prove as controversial as his last one, which suggested highly intelligent people are more likely to be atheists and political liberals. Using theories of evolutionary psychology, he argues smart people populate concert halls and jazz clubs because they\u2019re more likely to respond to purely instrumental works. In contrast, pretty much everyone enjoys vocal music.\u201d Classical Music Linked to High Intelligence ",

In general, psychologists and the neuro-scientists wouldn\u2019t have an interest in pursuing this question, either. Neuro-scientists have conducted studies on musical performers to understand their underlying brain anatomy as a function of years of playing various instruments. There are significant differences seen between non-musicians and professional musicians. The purpose of these studies was to understand how experiences change the brain over time. ",
