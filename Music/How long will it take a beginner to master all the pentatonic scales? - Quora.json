            "answer_text": "Depends on what do you mean by \u201clearning\u201d. If you are talking about learning how the pentatonic scales are constructed, it\u2019s easy. The minor pentatonic (which is used more compared to it\u2019s major counterpart) has the formula that goes like - 1 b3 4 5 b7 1, so for the key of A the minor pentatonic will be A C D E G A. Similarly for major pentatonic the formula is 1 2 3 5 6 1, and in the key of C it translates to C D E G A C. But in my experience, if you are a guitar player like me, you\u2019d want to remember the \u201cbox patterns\u201d of these scales over the fret board. When you map out all 5 notes of any key all along the fret board, you\u2019ll end up with five 2-note-per-string box shapes that are easy to remember, and even easier to play.  In the figure above notice that in position 1, the first note is G i.e. the root note of the key we are in. This is important because this lets you figure out all other 11 keys just by shifting all these shapes up or down by appropriate fret number. For example, we know that A is on the 5th fret on lower E string. So shifting all of the above shapes by 2 frets to the right. i.e. the position 1 root note on 5th fret, you are now in the key of A minor. A simple google search for major pentatonic shapes will similarly give you endless results, so I\u2019ll suggest don\u2019t waste your time in figuring out the notes by yourself. Now for the practicing part, I suggest, once you have memorized all these box shapes, start off by playing notes in a group of 3. for the key of A that would mean, A-C-D C-D-E D-E-G E-G-A so on. Do this for all the positions, and ascending and descending as well. This is important in fundamental blues phrasing. (as well as in countless guitar solos!!) Also if you are practicing on an acoustic guitar, playing above 12th fret might be difficult. So transpose the shapes that are beyond 12th fret to the open string position. for example, 12\u201315 on lower E would thus mean 0\u20133 on the same string. This will make it an octave lower, but still the same notes! I followed this practice method, and it approximately took me 2 months to memorize and play these scales at around 200 bpm effortlessly. (of course quarter notes!) ALL THE BEST ",
