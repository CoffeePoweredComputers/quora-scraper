            "answer_text": "Ok, so I went a little overboard, but they all fit the description (in my opinion). If you have the chance, these albums are all so much better if you listen to them all the way through, so give them a chance and treat yourself. Pink Floyd - Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon (Meddle : An album often overlooked due to the insane, and well-deserved, success of their other albums. Dark Side of the Moon : The cause of the shadow that Meddle lives in. An album that set out with a goal, nailed it, and no other album compares.) U2 - The Joshua Tree (The product of Bono\u2019s trip to Africa, taking a close look at America and tearing it apart for all it\u2019s flaws) Bruce Springsteen - Born to Run (An example of where real emotion is carried from writer to listener in an album. Oh, and that sax.) AC/DC - Highway to Hell (Due to the popularity of the title track, often people forget it\u2019s part of a killer album) Arctic Monkeys - Who The F*** are Arctic Monkeys (I think it\u2019s technically an EP but it highlights just how good the Arctic Monkeys were before they tried pop music) Black Sabbath - Paranoid (Full of well-known Sabbath songs i.e. Iron Man, Paranoid, and the lesser well-known songs aren\u2019t bad either) Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks (Possibly the greatest trio of successive albums ever released by a single artist, with such variety between them. Dylan at the peak of his artistic presence) Boston - Boston (Incredible debut album by a band often only known for their song \u201cMore than a Feeling\u201d. The whole album is full of great songs, lots of them even better than More than a Feeling) Carole King - Tapestry (Deep, meaningful, emotional, but also incredibly easy to listen to) Cat Stevens - Tea for the Tillerman (Contains \u201cWild World\u201d, which most people have heard, but the rest of the album is just as good, if not better) Coldplay - Parachutes, A Rush of Blood to the Head (A great group before success and fame got to them. Meaningful, but super easy listening) Crosby, Stills & Nash - Crosby, Stills & Nash (Three great artists in one) Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young - Deja Vu (Three great artists + an even better one) David Bowie - Hunky Dory (Just a great album from one of our greatest visionaries) Eagles - Eagles, Hotel California (Desperado, One of these Nights. Too many good albums, but start with the first two: their debut, as a country band, and the album that cemented them into Rock and Roll history) Earth, Wind & Fire - That\u2019s the way of the World (Their most complete album, great music, easy listening) Fleetwood Mac - Rumours (One of the greatest, strongest albums of all time. Every song is a classic) John Lennon - Imagine (Most people just know the title track. The rest of the album is worthy of a listen. Tells of a man fed up with society) Journey - Escape (Immortalised by the first track Don\u2019t Stop Believing, an album full of energy) Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly (Defining work of one of our time\u2019s greatest rappers, stepping outside of the conventional rap boundaries to transcend rap by infusing jazz, and retaining his story-telling power of a time riddled with social injustice) Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin IV, House of the Holy (The greatest albums by possibly the greatest rock bands ever. Enough said) Meat Loaf - Bat out of Hell (Full on, energetic, accessible rock. Full of power without being too much. Full of great tracks) Neil Young - Harvest (An artist so good he doesn\u2019t need a good voice to prove it. Great guitarist, better lyricist) Neutral Milk Hotel - In The Aeroplane Over The Sea (Not for the average listener. Folk + Country + Prog + Rock. A legendary album, but not for everyone. However, if it is for you, you\u2019ll love it) Nick Drake - 5 Leaves Left, Brayter Layter (A suicidal songwriter putting his thoughts and emotions down on paper, and communicating them through simple guitar and voice) Norah Jones - Come Away with Me (Britain\u2019s greatest soul singer? Incredible voice at her best) Oasis - Definitely Maybe, (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory (Two albums that helped define Britpop. Great modern music) Paul Simon - Graceland (The better part of Simon & Garfunkel at his best, incorporating South African music into pop at the end of the Apartheid era) Pearl Jam - Ten (Another great debut album, with Eddie Vedder pointing out anything he saw wrong with society and not giving a fuck) Queen - A Night at the Opera (Queen\u2019s fullest and most complete album, no holes to pick apart, featuring the eternal Bohemian Rhapsody) Rush - A Farewell to Kings (An accessible album by the Kings of Prog Rock) The Band - The Last Waltz (An unreal collection of artists and great songs performed live in an eternal drug fuelled live concert) The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds (The closest America ever got to matching the Beatles) The Beatles - Abbey Road, Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Magical Mystery Tour (Five albums from quite possibly the greatest band ever, each one mastering a new style of music perfectly) The Clash - London Calling (A great punk band proving that they have what it takes to do whatever music they want, exploring new boundaries) The Who - Who\u2019s Next (A great example of when sometimes less is more. The Who turned it down a bit for this album, without losing any of their signature sound) Van Morrison - Moondance (A great collection of songs showcasing his songwriting. Just good music really) Enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "I adore almost every single album I own (and I own quite a few of them). However, there are some that I adore more than others and here they are in no particular order: Billy Joel - The Stranger (1977)One of the best cases against using shuffle. The album is not merely a collection of songs jammed together on a disc, it tells a story. Really worth listening to from beginning to end in one sitting.Billy Joel - 52nd Street (1978)Much the same as The Stranger, 52nd Street is one of those albums that has to be listened to sequentially. Each song is new and different and adds to the last.Prince - Purple Rain (1984)The album that catapulted Prince to international stardom. Every single song on the album is a dense, rich soundscape. Prince (and the Revolution) was (were) so ahead of time that the album feels like it was recorded 4 years later than it actually was.The Beatles - 1966\u20131970 (Blue Album)Technically, this is a compilation. However, it presents most of The Beatles\u2019 best work over two discs, and the ordering of the tracks for me is almost perfect. It\u2019s not exactly chronological, but has been cut in a way that makes listening to it from beginning to end extremely fun. My favourite part is that it maintains the transition between Sgt Peppers\u2019 Lonely Hearts Club Band and With A Little Help From My Friends; a satisfying little key change and transition that works very well.The Beatles - 1962\u20131966 (Red Album)It\u2019s widely accepted that their earlier work is not as \u201cgood\u201d as their later work, however this compilation is a pleasure to listen to. Much like the Blue Album, it isn\u2019t cut exactly chronologically, but rather in a fashion where you can hear the Lennon-McCartney songwriting progress in technicality from vapid two minute pop songs (which are still very good as far as vapid pop songs go) to increasingly experimental/dense soundscapes and ever-improving competency.Travelling Wilburys [sic] - Vol. 1 (1988)Arguably the greatest concentration of musical talent since Band-Aid. This album exists only because George Harrison decided that Handle With Care was \u201ctoo good\u201d to be a B-side. He and his buddies Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne (lead singer of the Electric Light Orchestra) and Roy Orbison and wrote and recorded an additional 9 songs and cut an album, an album that went triple platinum. Every song is great and End Of The Line (the song that played during the finale of Parks and Rec) is the perfect end. Roy Orbison died that same year, and listening to the album leaves me feeling a little bit sad. Yet I keep coming back because every song is just that good.Michael Jackson - Thriller (1982)I\u2019m going to go a little more in depth here, because most people seem to ignore most of the tracks on this album and focus just on Thriller (the song). Much like Prince, Michael Jackson was light years ahead of his time, and Thriller is no exception. Thriller (the song) is just a fucking classic and everyone on Earth has heard it, yet the rest of the album is in my mind equally as good. The album starts on a high with Wanna Be Startin\u2019 Something, and the high just keeps going. The Girl Is Mine sees Michael joined by Paul McCartney, and the results are fantastic (apart from the \u201cdoggone\u201d girl being theirs, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this answer). Human Nature is downbeat and calm, Billie Jean and Beat It are Billie Jean and Beat It and P.Y.T will have almost everyone up dancing. Seven of the nine tracks on the album were released as singles, and most of them are Michael\u2019s most successful hits. I can listen to this album over and over again.Michael Jackson - Off The Wall (1979)Another testament to how far ahead of the game MJ was. When I first heard this album, I thought it must\u2019ve been recorded some time after Thriller. It predates Thriller by almost 4 whole years. In hindsight, there are some giveaways to this, such as slight remnants of disco in a lot of the tracks, however the overall sound to me is much more similar to that of the mid 80s than that of the disco era. As with the other albums on my list, the order in which the tracks are cut really adds to the listening experience. The album starts and ends with high energy, and has a period of calm chill in the middle of the second side. Much like Thriller, every song is a classic and will be stuck in most peoples\u2019 minds in just one listen.I may have gone a tad overboard, but I really wanted to hammer home the whole start-to-finish/all the way through business. I\u2019m a big believer in listening to albums the way the artists and producers intended, and in my experience it pays off heaps. These albums, while containing some fucking bangers, would not work nearly as well if the orders of the songs were jumbled up as with the Shuffle button popularised by digital music players. Anyway, I hope you go and give at least a couple of these albums a listen to, and more importantly I hope you find them as enjoyable as I do! ",
