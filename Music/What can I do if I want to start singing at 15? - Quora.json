            "answer_text": "You can sing when you are younger than that. I started singing when I was very young - I used to listen to music almost every night - Cliff Richard, Elvis, the Carpenters, Beatles, whatever cassette I could get my hands on. I sang when I was happy, when I was sad; when I couldn't sing aloud, I would sing in my head. I had the advantage: my parents were also singers. They were participants in one choir and led another. My brother sang too. I was put in a children choir when I was 5 or 6 not to perform by to tickle my interest in singing. My parents signed me up for piano lessons at 6 years old and only stopped when I was seventeen. I hang around people who loved to sing - not just my parents. If you are talking about performing then you have a lot of work ahead. I was performing in a choir when I was 14 and soon after in a duet with my brother. But be careful. Just because I did it does not mean you should. I do not perform because I want the limelight, I do so because I enjoy the singing - especially doing harmony. What factors could slow you down? Not enough exposure to music. Physical development of your voice and body. tone deafness. I am not formally trained but I suggest that you do take some lessons. But don't rush it. In fact, if you are placing a target to perform at 15 years old, I think it shows that you are overly driven. And I advise you to enjoy the process rather than aim for a target. Singing is a joy and it should be to you. It should also be a shared experience so enjoy it with friends even if they are not as good as you. Or if they are better than you = in fact, I recommend you hanging around people who are better than you - it will help you develop as a singer. Hang out with people who will tell you the truth. Hang out with people who are more mature so that you can learn from them. People who get into the limelight when they are young oft times explode because they don't have the maturity to handle the fame or the rejection. I end with singing is hard work but enjoy the process. ",

            "answer_text": "1.To sing well, you need  know how to read basic sheet music. Knowing how to read sheet music is important because as a singer you must know how far in the range one note is to the next note. Sheet music is a visual representation of how far you need to go up or down to hit a note and also describes the cadence of the notes. Knowing what series of notes are coming up gives the singer time to gather breath for difficult climbs up  and down the ladder of notes in a musical piece, and to then move to lower notes without breaking cadence. 2. You will need to widened the range of notes you can hit successfully, and consistently.  You can practice singing any style of music. Start out with songs that you like and that are not too difficult at first. 3. When you practice, plan on singing the song you are learning a couple of times without exerting your voice too much at first.  This is your warm-up. 4. After your voice is warmed up, stand up and sing the same song 3 to 5 more times, stretching for good execution at the lower and higher notes of the song. 5. Nurture your vibrato.  Sing the middle part of a song while holding easy notes and ululating your vocal cords.  Eventually, you will be able hold a note for some time, which will make your voice more interesting and nice to listen to.  Your vibrato will also help you sustain long, high notes in more difficult pieces of music. 6. Do not over practice. Over practicing can strain your vocal cords. Practice only around 30\u201345 minutes  a few times a week. Do not strain for high notes to early. 7. To preserve your voice, do not smoke or vape. ",
