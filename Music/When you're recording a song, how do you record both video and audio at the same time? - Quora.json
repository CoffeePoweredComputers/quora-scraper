            "answer_text": "Your going to need a field recorder with enough inputs for each instrument being played. The drums are going to need a separate mic for each piece set them pointed at the source of the sound about 6 inches away at a very low vilume(check with headphones) same with any amplifier. Then set you camera up with a steady cam or tripod or however your going to film it. Finally in an audio program put the audio file and the video files in rough order and drag the files around until the audio is in sync. An easier way to do this is when your ready to film use a clap board. Start the video recording clap the board into one of the mics at a point where the camera can see you doing it and that exact point on the audio will make a sharp wave form and you will know exactly where to move the audio around to sync it.

            "answer_text": "Using Audacity may be a good option. This is a free-to-use and open-source audio editing program, so it won\u2019t cost you any money. To use it to record audio from a video, just open the recording feature on Audacity, then play the video you want to record. After you finish recording, use its editing tools to crop the recorded audio and do any editing you want. To learn how to do this in detail, you may want to see this post.

            "answer_text": "It depends. Mostly don\u2019t. Try and deal with each separately. Audio is much better from a professional environment. You have to be in charge of your sync. It gets tricky. It\u2019s hard. Sometimes things don\u2019t work out. If you really do want to record both then use a good camera with the Tascam recording attachment. It\u2019s about as good as you can get for doing it all together. With mastering and a drummer who doesn\u2019t play too loud it might work. A lot depends on the musicians with that setup. ",
