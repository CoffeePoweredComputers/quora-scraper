            "answer_text": "I could easily be flippant and answer \"I am,\" however, the question a needs to be asked (I presume you are referring to the classical mainstream) - Underrated by whom? By conductors and performers, music scholars and critics, or the general music-loving public? Some composers have a remarkable shelf-life between their deaths and their music appearing regularly on concert programs; one of these is Gustav Mahler; revival of interest in his work dates from 1960-1, anniversaries of his birth and death occurred within a year. My vote for an underrated master rest with the Dane Carl Nielsen (1865-1931) who brought to the table, especially in his symphonies, a remarkably individual voice that was at odds with the Germanic tradition. It is with the remarkable recent flowering of talent in the Scandinavian countries that his output is being revisited and reassessed. Another is Leos Janacek (1854-1928) whose remarkable late burst of creativity places him stylistically him in the 20th century rather than the late-romantic era. ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure if underrated is appropriate, perhaps under appreciated: Sergei Taneiev (There are spelling variants). His Symphony No. 4 (Which he considered No. 1, the previous symphonies being practice pieces) is brilliant. I describe him as similar to Brahms, but with a Russian accent to the music. He had a profound understanding of counterpoint, and even wrote a treatise called Convertible Counterpoint, which I\u2019ve been through and learned much from. He also wrote movements of modest proportions, the whole symphony coming in at about forty minutes (I can\u2019t even listen to Bruckner and Mahler because they are way to prolix). Here\u2019s a version I found of the whole enchilada:  He was inconsistent though, and some of his chamber music strikes me as lame. ",
