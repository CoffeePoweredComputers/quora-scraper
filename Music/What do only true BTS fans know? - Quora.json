Unfortunately, no group lasts forever. Fans should just be thankful for the music the group has produced, their meaningful messages, their ability to transcend boundaries of age, gender, race, or background through their music, and the memories that would leave you crying due to joy or sadness.True ARMYs would know their names (both stage and real names), their personalities, and their facesThey are human beings and deserve privacy and respectWe do not know them. Of course, they show many aspects of their lives to their fans and many fans have a good sense of their personalities. However, so much happens behind closed doors. Many events or emotions are bottled up and are not disclosed. If they were to share something with their fans, it would essentially mean showing it to the entire public. Many celebrities do not want their fans to worry or perhaps do not want to ruin their image. So, no, we do not truly know them.They are human too; respect their privacy, know that they aren\u2019t perfect, love them for their flaws, and acknowledge that they go through a lot of hardships tooBTS loves to change up their style and not everyone will love everything they come out with. That doesn\u2019t make it bad. It makes it not your style. You should still respect them for making music for their fans.I\u2019m sorry, but they will, in all likelihood, never date you. They can be dating Instead, if they find a partner, we should be happy for them and we should support themThey work very hard and get little sleep to put out content to keep us entertainedThey have a lot going on in their personal lives and a lot of the time, they put on a brave face and just deal with itBeing a musician is hard. Even harder when the entire world is watching. Cut them some slackTrue ARMYs would ultimately respect and continue to support them if they end up finding a lover/partner. If you are a true fan you wouldn\u2019t turn your back on them and you wouldn\u2019t hate on them or their partner.They are not girls. South Korea has different beauty standards and like many other Asian men, the ideal look is flower boys or pretty boys. People think that they are more feminine because they wear makeup or dye their hair, but their company kinda makes them do that so that it looks more appealing to the public. I mean imagine if you had to perform in front of hundreds or even thousands of people. Wouldn\u2019t you want a little bit of coverage to hide a few flaws since your face will literally be right in front of a camera. Also, BTS isn\u2019t afraid to show their bare faces. In fact, they have a show called \u201cRun\u201d where they get to go on vacation, so they don\u2019t wear any makeup since they aren\u2019t performing or anything like that.",

            "answer_text": "Updated 31 July 2019 I like this question and I am glad to answer it for you. So here is the list, and it might or might not be applicable to all \u2018true ARMYS\u2019 but from my point of view I think that way: we know BTS member dates, however, we think it is better to not publicize it to keep them protected from the public eyes and the obsessive fans like Sasaengs. Adding to that, having a private relationship is a part of protecting their privacy.BTS work hard on the lyrics and the meanings on the album more than they want to be \u2018FAMOUS\u2019 as the public view them. They just want to spread their message to every place that needs their message.BTS needs rest, they know that they need rest, and they know that we want them to rest. However they don\u2019t want to do more work for money, they are doing it for ARMY\u2019S that need them and we all know it.We know that BTS is not forever, and one day they will settle down and move on with their lives as individuals in a part of their society. Some members might or might not pursue a solo career.BTS are humans, they make mistakes, they are not robots, they are not perfect. The most important thing is that they learn and admit their mistakes.We DO NOT MOB THEM. And WE SHOULD NOT MOB THEM. We believe in a personal space as they themselves requested.We stream their music not because we are obsessed with them, and not because we want to compete with the other fandoms. We stream to spread their music and message for them, and there is a big difference please see it.You STAN ALL OF THEM. If you don\u2019t then you are a fake fan :) (full offense here). or at least don\u2019t hate any member and respect all the members.BTS is not the perfect group. They live together (as far as we know) and people who spend so much time together will act like families, where problems occur, fights happens, they need their own personal space from each other, they need to SPEND TIME ALONE FOR GOD\u2019S SAKE. And when you see them fight or argue I have no idea why you are all in SHOCK, obviously it happens, as if you don\u2019t ever argue with your family members. Adding to that, they work together too, so that is hard on them. They didn\u2019t come together as BTS to be friends (except V and Jimin were before that) they came as BTS to work their ass off as a group.(Excuse my language here).10- Finally, we don\u2019t like false rumors, we don\u2019t like fake fans, we don\u2019t like the fans that represent us in a wrong way (Like in I-Heart Radio incidence), we hate people who hate BTS MORE THAN they hate on us ARMYS. Especially that \u2018hate\u2019 is a strong word if you noticed.So yeah! If I remembered something that the true ARMYS know I will edit to add it! :) ",
