            "answer_text": "The answers so far seem to point to innovative and popular guitar players. But, the question was best rock guitarists. I'm gonna answer with my 5 favorite best rock guitarists and the actual technical best rock guitarists. Many of the best rock guitarists are unsung session musicians and gunslinger-for-hire guitarists most have never heard of before. My Top Five Best Rock Guitarists List By Skill Steve Lukather \u2014 Probably the best technical player on the planet past and present. His tone is as chameleon as his chops. He tends to add a level of precision to records that no one else can.Tim Pierce \u2014 He's almost as technically perfect as Steve Lukather. He's appeared on many genres of rock albums. His tone is so clean at times, I wonder if he's found a secret no one else has.Jimmy Page \u2014 Simply, his sloppy is better than everyone else's perfection. He plays with soul and heart. Each note belongs.Cornell Dupree \u2014 He played on Aretha\u2019s Respect. That's all I need to say.Glen Cambell \u2014 One of the fastest and most accurate players of all time. An original member of The Wrecking Crew. He was amazing before having a successful solo career.My Top Five Favorite Best Rock Gutarists List Jimi Hendrix \u2014 The single most innovative sound in music came from his hands. He blended genres of old into art of the \u201chighest\" form. The music he heard in his head was as advanced as the techniques he pioneered and improved to be able to make it. Single most influential rock guitarist of all-time hands down.Jimmy Page \u2014 Took Delta Blues to the masses via heavy metal before that was a thing. He was the driving force behind their power. Jon Bonham was the boom that announced their intent, Page was the ferryman. He steered the boat.Brian May \u2014 Queen Guitarist. Genuis arrangements. Played just as many or few notes as the song needed. He was not flashy, but could have been. He held down the lead while letting Mercury shine.David Gilmour \u2014 Pink Floyd. Nothing else. Just Pink Floyd. He is responsible for that ethereal sound of muted importance. His playing didn't always shine brighter than the lyrics. That's what makes him a great. Restraint is as important as a balls to the wall twenty minute solo. Careful with that axe, Dave.Tom Morello/Jack White \u2014 They both are modern day forces of nature. I can't choose my favorite. They're so different, yet they both pushed rock in new directions and influenced a new era of musician. One common theme they share is raw passion for their craft. It shows. They paint a sonic canvass that none have touched in the last 20 years. I'm giving the edge to Tom. He was first. Jack is so much broader of a painter. Tom is Pollock, beautiful noise. Jack is Warhol, Pop Rock reflected into a higher form.My Honorable Mentions List For Best Rock Guitarists Kurt Cobain \u2014 Stop shaking your head. He wasn't the most technical, but his timing and minimalistic approach allowed an entire generation to pick up a guitar and learn a song that mattered. Unplugged In New York was a masterpiece. Going solo on Pennyroyal Tea, a two chord song for the most part, he showed us what a sad man with a slightly out of tune guitar could make us feel. Pure power, his voice was as much a part of his guitar playing as his fret hand. Each informing the other in a Beatles meets Leadbelly meets the Ramones mashup of pure emotion and screw all attitude while begging for our approval. It's still haunting 24 plus years later.Roger Miller \u2014 He wrote Oo-De-Lally and King Of The Road. Yeah, most have probably never heard these songs. Some have and never listened to the melodies he created. He was such an iconic voice. Listen again, but pay attention to his guitar playing this time. He had a way of playing and countering the melody that was perfect for the song.Cat Stevens \u2014 If you're a guitar player, go learn one of his songs. Wild World is popular. It's also melodic and dances along in a subtle, yet dang that was hard to play way. I never appreciated his skill until I learned a few of his songs. Hands down, the hardest to play and sing song I've ever learned is Wild World. There's so much happening in that song with the guitar to create harmony, it's tough to nail for even an advanced player.Eddie Van Halen \u2014 Just an innovative and creative guitarist that pushed every boundary a guitar has. He used a drill to play. He used a piano too. Very talented musician in every way. He made his own sound. The brown sound is famous among guitarists. I bought a Peavey 5150 the day it came out for $1150 as a broke high school student. I needed his sound. There was no better tone in all of music than during his heyday. It just sounded so muddy, and clean, like bells made of smooth glass in a blender. A bit too flashy and technical for my tastes. But, his tone alone is legendary.Robert Johnson \u2014 His blues licks still make up the backbone of Rock. He was a bluesman. But, there was nothing like his sound. Some say he got it from the Devil, some say he stole it from other lesser known guitarists. One fact is undisputed, he influenced everyone after him. Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, and many more owe their careers to him. I personally heard his influenced disciples before I heard him, so it lost the magic they must have felt. But, I get it. I see what they saw. Pure emotion and pain pouring out into licks the Devil wrote himself. Had to, it's still haunting almost a ninety years later.I know my lists echo other's and totally goes left field for an intro. This is merely my opinion. Ten years ago, you'd have gotten different answers I'm sure. I didn't even mention a player from Muscle Shoals or Motown. You'd be surprised to learn how much of the Motown sound was made by three country boys from Alabama. I didn't mention Tommi Iommi or Randy Rhoades. There were so many brilliant guitarists to chose from. I merely went with the parameters of the question. I selected the best rock guitarists based on how their playing makes me feel. Music is so subjective as is all art. This debate could rage for ages. We have a wealth of music to chose from and I'll never complain. Rock on! ",

            "answer_text": "I am not at all a fan of making music a competition by rating people as \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cbetter than\u201d and things like that. And because music is SO subjective, nearly everyone who reads my answer will likely have a different opinion from mine. And that\u2019s perfectly acceptable. My personal choices are based on their influences on my playing. (These are in no particular order, by the way.) Eric Clapton\u2019s phrasing during solos had a huge influence on me and how I approach expressing my emotions during a solo. His little quarter-step inflections, his liquidy phrases and his rich, rich vibrato still give me chills, even when the recording was done 50+ years ago. Jimi Hendrix\u2019s approach to rhythm playing still blows me away, 40+ years after he recorded. Granted, Jimi had gigantic hands that allowed him to do certain things I\u2019ll never do with my normal hands. But, his use of melodic rhythm parts really took that style of rhythm playing out of the shadows and made it something to take very, very seriously. Eddie Van Halen\u2019s approach to practically everything made me sit up and take notice. But for me, it\u2019s Eddie\u2019s attitude and approach that are most noticeable. Watch that man play and you know, beyond any doubt in the world, that he just plain loves to play guitar. Turns out that was an enormous influence on me. David Gilmour\u2019s playing influenced me in ways I find hard to explain but people are constantly telling me they hear it. His melodies, his vibrato (both hand and whammy), his little percussive chucka-chucka things at times, his multi-bends and over-bends for expressiveness\u2026very much a total package for me. Jimmy Page\u2019s very inventive rhythm work and uber-sloppy leads (c\u2019mon, let\u2019s be honest about it) were also big, big influences on me. Jimmy was a riff-master during the Zep years and his stuff was always so unconventional. Several of his solos were well-crafted and recorded with near-flawless execution (thinking Stairway, for example). But other solos, it\u2019s pretty obvious he was in full-out \u201cgo for it\u201d mode and could not have cared less about flawless execution. And those are deliciously sloppy. That\u2019s my list and I\u2019m looking forward to reading what others have answered. ",
