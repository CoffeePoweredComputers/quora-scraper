            "answer_text": "Play the music. The music comes from a part of your brain that thinks with memories of sensations, such as sound, remembered sights, smells, and so on. This part of your mind thinks all the time, but unlike most people, you are more aware of these thoughts. In most people the conscious brain is less connected to the sensate brain, and they don\u2019t \u201chear\u201d these thoughts as much. Your brain is you. Your entire brain, not just your conscious brain. You have a gift. Your sensate brain is thinking in music all the time. It is going to be a lot easier and more productive if you accept these thoughts and use them than if you try to fight them and stop them. For one thing, fighting yourself is a no-win proposition. For another, it is a gift. Finally, you are already in control of your brain. It\u2019s the conscious part of your brain that isn\u2019t in control. The problem is that the conscious brain thinks it should be in control, and that\u2019s not a helpful idea. If you want to clear the sensate brain, you have to give it a voice. You have to pay attention to it. You have to figure out why it thinks what it has to say is so important for you. You can only figure that out by listening to it and giving it a voice. Once it has a voice, you can accept its thoughts or not. But as long as you are fighting yourself, you will not stop the music. It will only get more and more insistent. What happens when you meditate is that you start accepting the thoughts, including the music. You accept them as part of yourself, and they no longer fight you. Acceptance has to become something you do all the time. Once the sensate brain understands that the conscious brain hears it and accepts it, it will not need to be as insistent and it will be able to relax more. Still, it is trying to bring something to your attention. I don\u2019t know what it wants you to know, but I believe you will gain more if you try to understand what is going on than if you try to stop it. It\u2019s up to you, of course. Try it different ways and see what happens. ",

            "answer_text": "Whatever you do often compounds Either good or bad. Let's say you go into a bar and start drinking vodka. What happens then? We all know that you will be drunk, unless you have some kind of unknown DNR that scientists are not yet aware of. If so, show us! If not, then it doesn't matter how eagerly and passionately you want to stay sober: alcohol will affect you. Now, it's the same with music. If you talk about it, complain about it and generally focus on it - it will keep playing inside your head. Why? Because our brains are just like that. If you don't use something - it gets weaker and it loses power over you. If you do - it gets stronger. Looking through psychological lenses it would only mean that neuron connections are getting stronger by use and weaker by not using them. So here's the solution just accept that you hear all this music and just do something else instead. Keep in mind, that there will be thoughts in your head, but the question is... ...what kind of? Will you spend your time listening something else and then you will hear different melody or it will be some thoughts, that you read from the book? Possibilities are endless, so choose what thoughts or music you want to keep playing. hope this was helpful. By the way, cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "CURES Scientists at Western Washington University found that engaging working memory in moderately difficult tasks (such as anagrams, Sudoku puzzles, or reading a novel) was an effective way of stopping earworms and of reducing their recurrence. Another publication points out that melodic music has a tendency to demonstrate repeating rhythm which may lead to endless repetition, unless a climax can be achieved to break the cycle. Research reported in 2015 by the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at the University of Reading demonstrated that chewing gum could help by similarly blocking the sub-vocal rehearsal component of auditory short-term or \"working\" memory associated with generating and manipulating auditory and musical images. It has also been suggested to ask oneself why one is experiencing this particular song. Another suggested remedy is to try to find a \"cure song\" to stop the repeating music. ",

Stop doing your task at hand every time the tunes would come in your head again, and refocus on your surroundings, ie,what are other people doing around you right then, is someone in charge in the room, is it pretty outside or raining or snowing ,etc. In that way, you can learn how to concentrate on the task at hand and do what's required at that very moment. Just think about what is being required at that very moment, and what you need to do to get it done.Anytime you hear the tunes again, start thinking again what's needed at the moment, instead.Eventually your mind will get it.

Sometimes just one listen-through can get rid of it, but other times I have to give it a couple rounds... It helps that I have a Spotify subscription and decent cell reception almost everywhere I am. On top of that, practicing Mindfulness (not sure if that's the type of meditation you spoke of, but if it isn't it's certainly something you should try) helps bring my thoughts under control (ugh, ADD can be a curse when it's not productive). The tools to get your mind under control do take some time to develop, but they are definitely attainable. Best of luck! ",

It has never bothered me: I just \"think over it\" or zone in to listen closer. Many of the pieces I've written were things I found floating around, and I'd ask myself, \"What's that? Have I heard that before?\" If the answer is \"no\" then it's something that I made up. But you're trying to turn it off....  This is several minutes later. I don't know how to turn it off. ",

Getting your mind in a state of flow i.e where you are cognitively engaged is key to prevent your mind from falling in the hands of the wandering jukebox hiding in the background. More generally, try doing anything that requires you to be present mentally, not too easy or difficult. Just the right pinch of challenge. Otherwise, you may attempt mindfullness meditation whenever the music starts to bother (control your breathing and try to notice the details, the in-between-the-lines of what's going on around you) Note: Mindfullness Meditation requires training. It will only become gradually efficient as it turns to a habit.. ",

Anyway I've heard this happens because our brain just HATES leaving things unfinished. So,what you could do is try to find out how the song ends, and play till the end of the song in your head. If this doesn't work, your best hope is to distract yourself with something else and ignore it till it goes away. Hope you find freedom, my friend. Peace! ",
