            "answer_text": "I didn\u2019t listen to all the languages in the world in music, but considering the ones I\u2019ve heard a lot\u2026 Best languages that I know: ENGLISH: Not the best opera and songs with a similar style of singing. It\u2019s very good for any other genre and wins over romance languages for any song that requires a lot of monosyllabic words. It\u2019s the main language of rock music. ITALIAN: Perfect for any genre but it maybe it suffers in rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. It has on average more syllables and it needs melody. For rap I didn\u2019t notice for rap I didn't notice a disadvantage compared to English. SPANISH: Basically I could do copy-paste with what is written for Italian. Maybe it has an edge in some dance songs, but it depends on what songs. PORTUGUESE: Other copy-paste with Italian and Spanish. It\u2019s the language of Bossa Nova and Fado. FRENCH: It\u2019s like in the middle between English and Italian. It\u2019s easier to change the same song from english to french than from English to Italian or Spanish or Portuguese. GERMAN: The only contraindication is in my opinion romantic songs ... I\u2019ve listened to songs in other languages but not so many to give an opinion. I can say that I liked songs in Romanian, Greek, Japanese, Serbian, Swedish, Finnish, Norvegian, Icelandic, Albanian\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yea, English comes first as an international language. But, if I have to chose secondary language for singing a song, I would chose Hindi, Indian language to sing a song. Here, I am sharing my own opinion and experiences: Hindi songs and movies are now getting renowned by the world and I have seen many foreigner who love Hindi songs and sometimes they sing as well. The most wondeful thing is they could sing as exact as we Nepalese and Indian people do. However, they feel weird to speak Hindi, but when they hear Hindi song, they can easily catch the lyrics, because Indian music and lyrics are so catchy. When I was very young, was vising local religiuous site, I met with foreigner, I forgot wheere was he from but I can remeber him singing Pardesi Pardesi Jana Nahi form hindi movie Raja Hindustaani. Similarly, when I was in Abu Dhabi, working in hotel, i met many Moroccan and Arabic people, even some African people sang hindi song from Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s movies. ",
