            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not privy to all his confidential medical history,. Van Halen originally had cancer of the tongue diagnosed 20 years ago. . .and it either recurred or he developed a second new tumor in his esophagus, and he just passed away with brain metastases. EVH originally attributed this cancer to his keeping a metallic pick in his mouth while playing. Others have attributed it to his long term smoking and drinking. I don\u2019t think EVH publically discussed it, but there were persistent rumors that his cancer had recurred going back a few years now. Supposedly he was undergoing radiation therapy to keep the cancer in check, and his former bandmate David Lee Roth hinted earlier this year that he wasn\u2019t doing well. Roth spun this to refer to his musical ability, but I think he was probably referring to EVH\u2019s general health, and just realized he went too far mentioning this. David Lee Roth says Eddie Van Halen is \u201cnot doing well\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Cancer. I am shocked. Never knew he had cancer. One of my favourite guitarists. Truly very sad. I\u2019m going to play a video from You Tube of my favourite Van Halen song, Jump. Just want to see that contagious smile of his that drove the girls crazy, especially my sisters Lori and Tracy who had a mad crush on him. Truly one of my favourite bands. Every musician in this band was top notch. Roth too, was one of my favourite front men. I would have LOVED to play on stage with these guys. Did a lot of covers of their songs with my band. Eddie was only 65 years old. Goodbye Eddie and rest easy my brother musician. I and many others will miss you.  ",
