            "answer_text": "Bhojpuri songs used to be very euphonious and lyrical close to 10\u201315 years ago. I used to be a great admirer of bhojpuri songs at those times. But now, these songs have utterly lost their charisma. Lyrics are laced with vulgar meaning and are totally nonsensical. Music is very noisy and always hurts my ears whenever I listen, that too, accidentally. Songs have no feelings, no emotions at all. The singers, who are in bhojpuri songs\u2019s market today, are lacking of the ABCs of music. Ironically, they do not sing.Instead, they shout. I cannot sing, listen, play today\u2019s bhojpuri songs because I feel embarrassed when I do all this. In a nutshell, bhojpuri songs are not affordable to survive with in this era. Thanks!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I am eligible to give answer because i am bihari but modern bihari. Bhojpuri song mainly love, romantic, dance,item songs are becoming vulgar. In the last 5 years bhojpuri songs became insane vulgar . Some actor like manoj tiwari, ravi kishan, Nirahua & pawan Singh are better because they never cross their limits & they have taken the bhojpuri cinema to its new height but manoj & ravi are doing less film. Some mad actor like arvind akela(kaluu) , khesari, taken bhojpuri cinema to low level by using wrong words to women, using double meaning words, loving like road side romeo but as pervert. Now, every cinema in bhojpuri using item songs which are slang, sex oriented or double meaning , director are taking models who can show their body and Wear wild cloth plus bhojpuri actress are mostly fat (overweight )! If, bhojpuri industry doesn't stop to produce vulgar songs then the bhojpuri will lost his beautiful charm as known in India. ",
