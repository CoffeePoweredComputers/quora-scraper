The former is great for arguments or leaving reminders to myself - no more post-it notes, I keep my to-do list in my Saved Messages and edit it as I go. The latter helps me keep files in order and accessible wherever I am. I\u2019m a pretty forgetful person so having my tickets, documents, books, etc all in one place is a lifesaver. ",
