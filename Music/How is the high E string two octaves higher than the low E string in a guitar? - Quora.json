            "answer_text": "Original question: How is the high E string two octaves higher than the low E string in a guitar? For this, you need to know your scales right. The low E string is followed by the A string, which in turn is followed by the D string. On the D string\u2019s third fret you will find another E. This E is one octave higher than the low E string. Proceeding similarly, there\u2019s only a range of one octave between the D string\u2019s second fret and the high E string. So in all, the Low E string is a couple of octaves lower than the high E.
