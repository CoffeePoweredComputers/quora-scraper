            "answer_text": "They\u2019re both Canadian and talented. Justin is in the industry for many years but Shawn is known for 2\u20133 years. I mean Justin is known as a talented pop star but even Shawn is new, he is known as a talented canadian singer and song writer. I don\u2019t know i was belieber in 2012\u20132013 and to me Justin was only good at these years im not belieber anymore. I don\u2019t feel hate to him i just can\u2019t feel something about him cause i can\u2019t find the words to describe how he is changed 2012 to 2018. So I\u2019m Mendes Army right now and i\u2019m sure that i\u2019ll never give up to love him. Cause he is so different. I didn\u2019t feel the same when i was a belieber and my feelings to him. My feelings are more mature. I mean I\u2019m thinking more mature than the 2012 year. I definitely continue to support him at any cost. Cause I realise the important thing that he is my light in the darkness. No matter what it costs i\u2019ll try to protect him from any bad thing. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, I see Bieber as more of an entertainer than Shawn Mendes. Mendes is more of a John Mayer type; talented, good singer-songwriter, decent looking, but mostly stationary on stage with their guitars. I see Bieber as more of a Justin Timberlake (I wouldn\u2019t dare to compare him to Michael, lol); tons of stage presence, attractive, and good at a little bit of everything. I like them both as artists. However, I have to be in a mood for one or the other; Bieber gets me really hyped and Mendes is a good artist for a mellow mood. ",
