            "answer_text": "That's been a really hard one for the industry since tons of stuff was put out but not submitted anywhere for official copyright status. Obviously anything pressed on disc has copyright, but it is unclear who has the rights and when they expire. And a complication is that copyrights expired X years after the death of the copyright holder. But if you don't know who that is (even if you know what year the copyright started) you can't tell if the copyright has lapsed yet. In short, there is no easy way for most of the content (especially if a company does not own the copyright) to make this determination. ",
