            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s tough to call them a one-hit wonder because they were well enough known locally. But Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah had one national hit that has re-emerged because it is on Peter Quill\u2019s \u201cAwesome Mix #2\u201d in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, called Lake Shore Drive. This isn\u2019t even my favorite song on the album, but it is probably the best. Long Time Coming:  It strikes a chord for me because it has a story. Part 1: At the beginning of my freshman year in college, a group of new friends were discussing local bands from back home. I mentioned AHJ and suggested they may have heard their song Lake Shore Drive. Nobody was familiar with it, so I tried to find a local FM station that took requests to play it. After listening long enough to get their phone number, I called. But they claimed to have never heard of the band, or the song.Part 2: The next day, a record store held their annual \u201cbait the new freshmen\u201d sale, and to my surprise I found AHJ\u2019s album at the front of the \u201cmiscellaneous As\u201d bin. So I bought it, took it to the dorms, and listened to it three times while organizing the new room.Part 3: After the third time, I reverted to the radio which was still on the same station. The first full song they played was Long Time Gone. So they did, in fact, have the album and had heard of them.",
