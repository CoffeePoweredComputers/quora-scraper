            "answer_text": "Yes, I had very great memory in marching band. It is a big story but I try to answer as short as possible. It happened in my 12th standard. There were  four houses in my school as Green, Red, Yellow and Blue. I was in green house. There was always great competition between green house and red house. Because, past few years red house got overall winner cup and green house got overall runner cup. As per my school rule, every house  should participate in sports and should perform marching on sport day ceremony. There is also prize for house who march well, it will also take in  count for overall performance for house. On that year, both houses  won the prizes moreover equally in sport events .Both houses were in great tough that who would get the overall winner cup. So, both house had great pressure on final event. The marching event on sport day ceremony infornt of cheif guest was the final event  to prove our house. All the houses were practiced well. On ceremony day morning, every house did some extra things to prove their house like wearing their house color ribbon on hand etc.. Our house was so nervous. Everyone discussed about any new idea to prove ourselves in marching. Suddenly we got one idea but little risk to do without practice but should do.  Before 10 min to start the ceremony, my band leader brought the bag full of  small  shining color papers. And he gave one hand full of those papers to every student in the band.  I too got those papers and holded in hand. He told the idea that on marching we need to salute when reach the chief guest stage. At the time of raising the hand to salute, the students in band should release those papers and salute the guest.. The plan was superb but if any one  did mistake then this will turn to bad point to lose the prize. So all were nervous. The band will face the chief guest stage on right side only. So the leader gave pressure on right side line of band. I was on the right side and I was on double pressure and double nervous. The ceremony started and all house performed marching one by one . the both houses were performing  and marching well . The red reached the cheif guest stage ,saluted and moved by marching. We reached the cheif guest stage, we were all so nervous. Once the leader shout to turn head to salute, all were perfectly raised the hand , released the papers and salute.The color papers flew all over the stage.The cheif guest and all other teachers surprised and clapped for our performance. We too so happy for timing and performance. Finally, we got the prize for marching and also got overall winner cup for that year. Now also I am so happy to think that performance and victory. Great team work. Thanks to all other guys who marched in my band to get that great memories. Thanks for reader to read my answer with such a long story of my great memory in marching band. Thanks for this question to remember my past golden memories. Whenever I see the  shining color paper or any other marching performance,  I got this colorful memories . \u200b ",

            "answer_text": "My experience in marching band? Okay, let's start off with this is my third year of playing my instrument, and I\u2019m the only freshman with second clarinet music, instead of the usual \u201cthird clarinet music because you're new here stuff\u201d. I am also center-guide for the newbie ranks so EHTSGEDDIT! Let's get one thing straight. Marching band is hard. We do the work, and we are underappreciated for it. For example, the football kids say what we do is \u201clightwork\u201d compared to what they do. NOT TRUE! At my school at least, we do conditioning before we start our practices. People underestimate how hard it is to control your breathing, remember set\u2019s, music, dynamics, key signatures, visuals,keep good tone quality, and keep in step. Which leads to my next thing\u2026 MARCHING I know it looks easy, BUT IT\u2019S NOT!!!!! Imagine this: marching down a street making sure your in line with the people in front of you and the center guide, or whoever is closest to the center that is next to you. You have to roll your feet, (which is basically stepping on your heel first to walk.) in order not to bounce (doesn\u2019t look as neat) Maybe it to you it doesn\u2019t seem so bad but oh, IT BURNS. Parades that we do can get up to three miles long\u2026 up and down hills\u2026 in a longsleeved mainly black cotton uniform, and a shako (the hat marching band members wear)\u2026 and the pressure of being judged. (you are literally judged and given a score. Separate scores are given to the band, drum major, and the Auxiliary) You are also filmed and then judged by the rest of your band, for marching mistakes. But of course fieldwork and street is not all we do. It\u2019s not all we are about. Being the largest band in the district has it\u2019s advantages, such as always getting first when we do more local competitions, being able to go to the invitation-only competitions, which are hours away. Being in band is like having a second family (only better tbh.) We all love and support each other. Although I came into the band only knowing 3\u20134 people, who I was not very close with, the band accepted me with open arms. The reason why we have such a good band, even though we are the youngest band program in the district, (12 years 190+ members) is because we have such a amazing band director. We call him Mabrey, not Mr.Mabrey, just Mabrey. He\u2019s really chill, he makes jokes with us, and he really cares about us. He is one of those people who says \u201cI am willing to do anything for you guys\u201d and truly means it. Some other schools who are our competition have actually decreased in size because people did not connect with the band director, which is a problem. Band directors should be one of your best friends. They should follow you on twitter, and your meme accounts about said band director. Okay now for the practice schedule (I got a little off topic) Monday: day off (WOO HOO) leader meeting at lunch (anyone can come btw) Tuesday: Band practice 2:50\u20135:15 Wednesday: sectionals 2:50\u20134:30 Thursday: Band practice 2:50\u20135:15 Fridays: football games 5:00-(at most) 11:00 Saturdays: Competitions: ALL DAY LONG Sundays: Section hangouts or rest day So m experience in band is amazing. Yes, I may sound super nerdy to anyone not in band, but walk a day in our shoes and you\u2019ll know too\u2026 the feeling only a band kid can have. You\u2019ll experience loud singing on the busses (NEVER GO ON BUS TWO\u2026) and getting to spend every single day with the best people in the world. If you have ever had friends who joined band and slowly left you, don\u2019t take it personally. EVERYBODY DOES IT. wow I sound like a complete jerk. But your section is literally family. You get so close with them, even in a short span of time\u2026 I\u2019ve been with them for what? 3 months? And I know there are no better people in this world. You watch as you become best friends with a bunch of total weirdos, those classified as \u201cnerds\u201d. Yeah I know, maybe you care too much about your self image for that. But when the crowd, who some you may know personally, screams for the band, screams your name as you walk of the field, when you win the first place ranks, and sweepstakes, and you guys have a party in the bleachers, you\u2019ll realise how wrong everybody else was. Try it. I dare you. ",
