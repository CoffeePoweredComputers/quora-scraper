            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have specific favorites, but here\u2019s a truly unproblematic K-Pop group. TVXQ. When I say TVXQ, I\u2019m discarding the three members that left. But the remaining members, Changmin and Yunho - boy. Yunho is publicly known as the K-Pop idol with rigid morals and an incredible ability to stick to them. He\u2019s never been caught in a scandal. Neither has Changmin (there was a time when there was a 2012 \u201cscandal\u201d where he was apparently caught on a date with a woman, but people were left speechless when the long haired human being next to him was actually Minho from SHINee.) These two are so \u201cclean\u201d that Dispatch gave up trying to find fault in their behavior, and sasaeng fans that follow these two 24/7 have nothing to say about them. Their schedule is home, practice, home, practice, wash, rinse, repeat. Whenever these two are caught going somewhere outside their houses or the SM company building, it\u2019s normally to convenience stores. It\u2019s rare that a group will be this unproblematic. These two are the only ones I can think of that have never been in scandals or have stirred up at least a bit of drama. Of course, it\u2019s impossible to say for sure, because we can never know what they actually do, but TVXQ come pretty close. ",

Stated proud to be a Korean? Let their real personalities come through for a second? Not disrespected their sunbaes? Not giggled out of nervousness at inappropriate times? There's no such animal as an unproblematic artist in Kpop. ",
