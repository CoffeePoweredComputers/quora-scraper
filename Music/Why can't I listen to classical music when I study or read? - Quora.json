            "answer_text": "as said above (or below), how we react to music is individual.  As a classical music lover, I guess, you can 'read' into the layers of sound as if it had lyrics.I tend to do the same. It gets worse when it's baroque, because then I get lost tracing the melodic lines for various instruments.This is why I stopped listening to classical music when working/studying. I don;t listen to any other music either. I'd suggest you try studying in silence, or relative silence with just everyday 'white noise' around you, i.e. humming of everyday appliances or noise from the street is ok, but no people talking, TV, radio, etc.  If you live/study somewhere with a lot of street noise and if you can make out what ppl in the streets are saying it's probably not going to work, because your mind will be tempted to explore what they're saying. If you can't focus in this kind of environment, get a pair of noise-cancelling muffins or find a totally quiet place. Some people may be swearing that listening to this kind of music or that kind boosts their productivity/creativity/whatever by (gazillion %). And maybe it is, but it looks like it doesn't work for you. Our brains evolved looking for patterns. Yours loves musical patterns and will be looking for them everywhere. hope it helps Joanna ",

            "answer_text": "You do indeed love classical music if you are following its patterns instead of following what you're supposed to be studying. I sometimes do the same thing when I'm at the ballet. The choreography may be inventive, the dancers may be brilliant, but because of my knowledge of music I find myself ignoring the input from my eyes to follow the input from my ears.You definitely need to find more appropriate selections to hear while studying. If you can't go without music altogether because you need it to help block other distractions such as people talking or traffic in the streets, then look for calmer music. I have several 2-CD anthologies of slow and quiet music extracted from larger classical works. They're chosen not to be too loud or too exciting, so they are very helpful in keeping the mood within bounds.There is the classical music designed as background music. Haydn and Mozart wrote quite a lot of music for small ensembles, especially for winds, that are not too complex but which provide a very pleasing backdrop to other activities. Lesser composers' entire oeuvre may fall into this category. Danzi and Quantz are examples.In recent decades, the rise of Minimalism and New Age music have given us large amounts of music which are designed to be rather uneventful but which provide harmonic pleasure. The Prelude to Wagner's Rheingold has many descendants in New Age music.Once you know where to look, you can build up a library of \"study music\" to help you enjoy your hours of revision as well as to keep you fresh and focused.",
