            "answer_text": "The popular perception of musicians is either of strikingly handsome, flawless, charismatic and constantly nonchalant men with the voices of angels, slowly strumming the same 4 chords while singing some pretentious song about love, or just some hot woman wearing a skimpy outfit while signing. The latter is a bit lacking since I wouldn\u2019t know much about that particular perception. This is precisely why musicians have a somewhat romantic quality inherently lent to them. Not because of music itself, but because of the qualities that tend to accompany it. Well, unfortunately for everybody, this perception is mostly false. Real musicians are just like everybody else, but with added suffering. There\u2019s nothing romantic about constantly banging out the same 16 measures, trying to get it to play right. And if we\u2019re talking about brass players, have you ever seen them emptying spit from their instruments? Look at that long enough and their saliva isn\u2019t going to be the only thing hurling out of an orifice. As to repertoire, most \u201cromantic\u201d songs aren\u2019t what classical musicians prefer. 4 chords and some mawkish lyrics are nice and all, but an embryo could do that. The repertoire at the heights of musicality aren\u2019t very pleasant, much less romantic. I don\u2019t really want to hear someone banging out Bartok and Khachaturian on a first date, and most would probably concur with me. Even the deceptively named Romantic era isn\u2019t particularly amorous in its style. Schumann isn\u2019t going to get anybody in the mood and the only sentiment that Rachmaninoff evokes is when your spouse doesn\u2019t do the dishes. So, I apologize for utterly upsetting anybody\u2019s romantic perception of musicians, but this is just the unfortunate reality of the situation. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read Paul Woos response which is more about the TV/Pop entertainment industry than musicians, although he certainly does reflect how many listeners/viewers may see musicians. Mostly when such pop music is shown -any musicians are firmly in the background of the singer/dancer/poseur. I have been a non professional musician for decades and I have deduced that few people, even those that say they love music have ANY understanding of the skills, the theory, the process of making music. Ask the average person to mimic someone playing guitar or saxophone or whatever, and you will see how little they understand about what a musician does. However, (at least until lockdown) I have been accustomed to people saying to me after a gig or spot \u201cOh you are so lucky to sing/play like that!\u201d or \u201cI wish I could sing/play like you!\u201d I smile and nod and say thank you, but inside I am mildly irritated by the unintentional implication that my skills were achieved by luck, or by wishing. However, the point of performing is to use hard gained skills to \u201centertain\u201d your audience, and if/when they receive pleasure from your efforts, then your job is done. Personally I am rarely satisfied with my playing as I know that there was some aspect that was less than perfect but I also know that few if any (even other musicians) will have noticed. The \u201cQuality\u201d, if there is one is about developing the playing and performing skills. which are rarely understood, perhaps it is the communicative skills that may be seen as attractive. ",
