            "answer_text": "It\u2019s largely a matter of preference in sound, budget, and to some extent, your physical condition. From the moment I first played one, I have loved the sound of the cello. You could never convince me to switch to violin and leave cello behind. If, on the other hand, the sound of the violin (or its repertoire) is what sets your soul on fire, there\u2019s your best option. Cellos and all of their related accessories (at specific levels of quality or provenance) are always going to be more expensive than violins. Their larger size means that they\u2019re a bigger hassle to haul around, to store, and often a bigger hassle to maintain. Best to anticipate this financial dimension to your choice. As I teach my students, cello should be played with a relatively stress-free technique. We sit as comfortably as possible and we take advantage of gravitational force to a large extent for the most efficient way to play. Violin, on the other hand, demands posture and technique that, for some people, can involve increased levels of sustained tension (although there are strategies for reducing this). Your physical build may also have an impact on how it feels to play each instrument. I\u2019m fairly tall and long-limbed so cello feels easy to me. For someone smaller, the violin may suit her or him better. I\u2019d suggest seeking out a source of instruments for loan and maybe get some beginner coaching or lessons with a qualified teacher to see which instrument fits you better. And you needn\u2019t commit for life! You could always switch if your preferences or goals change. Happy investigating! ",
