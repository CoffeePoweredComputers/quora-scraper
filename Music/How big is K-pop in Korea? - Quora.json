            "answer_text": "As someone who\u2019s actually been to Korea, I\u2019ll say not as popular as you\u2019d think. Most idols are known, but as a general public most people in Korea do not actively listen to Kpop. It\u2019s very popular with a specific demographic of high schoolers, younger women or older men in some cases. A lot of Koreans prefer ballad type music such as the music you\u2019d hear in a kdrama, or contemporary indie music like Coffee Boy. K-artists are also very popular with a wider demographic, and rap/pop music is HUGE with the younger generation, most of the fans you\u2019ll find will be fans of Ariana Grande. But Kpop is not something most Koreans actively listen to. But the idols are well known in the public, aswell as their popular releases. ",

            "answer_text": "This is like saying is rap popular in America. And if you're still wondering, yes. Kpop is the most popular music in Korea, although Western pop is a close second. I hear that in Seoul you can see stores that sell idol-faced products. There are BTS, EXO and BlackPink product placements wherever you go in Seoul such as lots of Kbeauty (skin, hair, and makeup), food items (drinks, snacks) and whatnot. Because it's in their pop culture, I bet most Koreans listen to it without a second thought. However, a lot of them are fascinated with Western music (pop, R&B, rap). It's the same for Kpop fans in primarily western countries. Hope that helped, and here's a Dua Lipa and a Ryujin for your troubles \u263a\ufe0f:   ",

More or less the K-Pop is associated with a number of Korean industries such as the beauty/modelling industry. I can only say that K-Pop is huge in Korea, although many of my friends who have lived in Korea before tell me that western influences are more popular like movies and tv shows. ",
