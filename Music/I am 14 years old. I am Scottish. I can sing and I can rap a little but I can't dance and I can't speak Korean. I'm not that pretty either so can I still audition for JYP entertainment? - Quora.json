            "answer_text": "Honestly, don\u2019t waste your time. It\u2019s hard enough for 100% Koreans WITH talent to get in to JYP. They\u2019re not going to accept a non Asian foreigner with very little basic skills. JYP has a specific look and style they look for in their potential trainees and they have over the years rejected some very talented people like Gfriend\u2019s Yuju, IU, Dean, BTS\u2019s JHope. So for them to reject people with actual talent and looks that match the Korean Beauty standard but take in a non-Asian foreigner??? Unlikely. Keep in mind, this is a Big 3 company we\u2019re talking about here. One of the largest entertainment companies in Korea and one of the ones who paved the way and molded Kpop to what it is today. They\u2019re not going to blindly pick people to take in as trainees. Also, Korea itself is still not very fond of foreigners coming in and essentially taking jobs away from their citizens. East Asian foreigners get away with a bit because they at least look the part and can blend in. But even then, many foreign idols deal with a lot of hate and get picked apart for the smallest things they do. JYP has never accepted anyone who wasn\u2019t at least half Asian and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll start anytime soon. ",

            "answer_text": "Uhhhhhh that's gonna be a lot of heartbreak if you do try. I'm not discouraging you, but it's a very low chance that JYP, one of the big 3, will accept a non-Asian who can't dance or doesn't have the visuals to make up for it. I sound really harsh right now, but it's the sad truth. If you can only sing, you stand very little chance of getting into any agency. Korean agencies look for all rounders. You have to be good at singing, dancing, have the looks, and if you can rap or act, that's a bonus. I'm just saying, don't get your hopes up if you audition. I can't judge how well you've groomed your talents to be a Kpop idol through a screen, but if it's really as mediocre as you describe it, you stand an incredibly small chance of even being considered.
