            "answer_text": "Some of the great advertisements I recently came across - Sweet kills. A poster made to raise awareness about diabetes.  A graphic way to remind people about the dangers of smoking.  Give blood. Replenish someone\u2019s life.  A project promoting organ transplants in China.  Children spend less time outdoors than a prison inmate.  Child labor. If you don\u2019t speak up, it doesn\u2019t stop.  UNICEF : We work for a world where this picture doesn\u2019t have another meaning.  The longer a child with autism goes without help, the harder they are to reach.  On the importance of making the city accessible for disabled people.  A project aimed at raising awareness about loneliness among the elderly.  Romania against waste: How big must litter be so we\u2019ll stop ignoring it?.  A warning about using your phone while driving.  This is how the environment lives: trying to survive.  A reminder that deforestation causes real suffering.  It\u2019s not fur. It\u2019s someone\u2019s mother. Source - BrightSide - Inspiration. Creativity. Wonder. Edit 1- A few more on the Christmas theme.     Don\u2019t drink and drive.      Edit 2 - This ad for World No Tobacco Day compares two sides of a woman\u2019s face to demonstrate the ravaging effects of smoking  This ad for tea brand Curtis takes advantage of the sensation of smell and taste that can come with looking at a piece of fruit. Add a little steam and your mouth starts water.  Heinz appeals to its audiences\u2019 tastebuds in this ad for tomato ketchup. According to the ad, your steak and French fries are going to taste like cardboard without their world famous sauce.  This ad for the London Marathon by Reflex Spray has a shoe with a miniature re-creation of London on its sole. The shoe has literally run all over the city.  This campaign called \u201cWork Ache\u201d for painkillers Aspirina Bayer features a stapler painted with a man face down holding the sides of his head. It cleverly depicts how a headache can feel like you\u2019re hammering your head on the desk.  Bike machinery becomes body machinery in this ad by Argentenian studio La Comunidad promoting the health benefits of cycling. Concept, design and consistency makes for an aesthetically appealing and easy to understand campaign.  A dog taking a selfie? Not quite. This ad by Ogilvy Istanbul is for Ford\u2019s Rear View Camera and it features a dog staring straight into the camera \u2013 in effect, straight out to the audience \u2013 to bring feeling and emotion to an important message.  If you need to get the bus to the airport, this clever wrap gives you an idea of what's coming next. When viewed from exactly the right angle, when the sky is its most sky blue, you'd almost be fooled into thinking you're watching a bus taking off. Or at the very least pulling an impressive wheelie.  The idea behind using Wite-Out is to fix things. The campaign showed Bic Wite-Out correcting societal problems that are faced in Kenya: crime, poor infrastructure, poverty, lack of education etc. This series of print ads was created by Kenyan agency Flametree.  Hats off to the ad copy of the Nut brand needless to say that the timing totally nailed it!!  Instant Fryer  Mattress so soft that you sleep like a baby   Source - Itchy Ketchup | Facebook ",
