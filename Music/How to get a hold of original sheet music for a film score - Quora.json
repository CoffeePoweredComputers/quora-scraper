            "answer_text": "The vast majority of original film scores are never published or made available, so you\u2019re almost certainly out of luck. I believe this is due to copyright and rights issues: film studios specify that the scores become their property and guard them jealously because they want control over how the music - and hence the film - is perceived. With less well-known composers, I\u2019ve had occasional success with a direct email. I suspect John Williams gets hundreds of such requests every week, and that he releases his scores very rarely indeed. If you\u2019re hoping to perform these pieces, there are many published transcriptions and arrangements, to suit most skill levels. Their quality varies, of course, but some of them are really quite close to the originals. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "If you read this article: The Film Music Society, it seems more difficult than you might think. What is your purpose? You'll need permission if it's for a concert. If your goal is to learn orchestration, Williams\u2019 scores are always well orchestrated, but you could learn the same skills by studying Holst\u2019s \u201cThe Planets,\u201d a widely available score found in any good music library. If you live near a top university with a well known music school and library, even in this digital age you can go there and look at scores and ask them how to locate a score they don't have. Or you could try contacting organizations like the one linked above. ",
