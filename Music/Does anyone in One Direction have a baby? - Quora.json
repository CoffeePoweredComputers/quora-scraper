            "answer_text": "Yes, two of the members are already fathers and one on the way! Louis Tomlinson had his son, Freddie on January 21, 2016. With American stylist Briana Jungwirth who he is no longer in a relationship with (it was more of a summer fling). Liam Payne had his son, Bear, on March 22, 2017, with his then girlfriend and singer Cheryl but the pair split in July of 2018. It was announced on April 30th on the Jimmy Fallon show that Zayn and Gigi Hadid were expecting, with a projected due date in September. Harry Styles and Niall Horan are not in any public relationships at the moment, so I don't think there will be a pregnancy announcement any time soon with them. ",
