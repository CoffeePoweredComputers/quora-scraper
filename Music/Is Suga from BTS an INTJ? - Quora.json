            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s very likely. I\u2019m an INTJ. We\u2019re fairly uncommon, so it\u2019s not that hard to spot someone like you when they do appear. In typical INTJ fashion, here\u2019s a detailed analysis on Yoongi\u2019s personality. There are pretty strong evidences that suggest as such, but also one morsel of doubtful evidence that suggest otherwise. I\u2019ll tackle that first, to get it out of the way.  Last year, during the BTS festa, they released \u2018resumes\u2019 which also entailed their MBTI profile. Me, being an MBTI nerd, was extremely excited to see how the results would be, as I\u2019d already made my own deductions. Never thought they\u2019d do the test. What better way to know than to actually have them take the test themselves. Here\u2019s the part in Yoongi\u2019s profile where it states his alleged MBTI type.  Translation credits : peachisoda (@peachisoda) | Twitter But wait? Doesn\u2019t it say \u2018INFP\u2019? Look closer. When I see people defend this (Yoongi being an INFP), they say that we shouldn\u2019t claim to know BTS better than they know themselves. The data is there, but we must be critical and careful of it. Here are some factors to consider. Yoongi gave a half star accuracy. It\u2019s not even a full star. If you wanted to see a movie or go to a hotel, you wouldn\u2019t look at a half star rating and think that it\u2019s reputable / reliable.We don\u2019t know exactly how the results were obtained -Did they hire a professional to type them or was it merely some online test (we all know how reliable those are)?How many times did they take the test?Were they informed of the cognitive functions?Hence I don\u2019t think this typing is accurate, even if straight from the horse\u2019s mouth. In fact, I think some of the other members were mistyped as well, but that\u2019s for another time. Furthermore, the line which Yoongi chose from the INFP description that fits him the most is about the least INFP thing ever. \u201cControl is needed for the littlest thing in order to develop consistency\u201d  Meanwhile INTJs are pretty known for having a penchant to control / put things in order (see also : Yoongi\u2019s affinity for being the MC in Run BTS).  Alright, now here\u2019s an analysis on the INTJ functions and how Yoongi displays them. Ni (Introverted Intuition) When he does speak up in interviews, Yoongi is articulate, connecting his points and insights to the bigger picture (social and political issues, for example). You can tell that he has a main goal in his words, and everything kind of ties to that one point that he\u2019s trying to express. Furthermore, Yoongi\u2019s pretty ambitious. He\u2019s kept the same vision of reaching people with his music ever since he was young and his philosophies about it are unwavering. It\u2019s because that\u2019s the time I\u2019m living right now. If you hear the conversations I have with my peers or with my older brother, not having a clear dream has been my biggest worry. - The reason is simple. I started with the purpose of trying all the things I wanted to try. While thinking I should just express myself transparently. I wanted to try putting out music that was just made how I thought of it, the direction my heart went. I worked very freely on both the genre and the lyrics. - When I was young, I prefered hands-on learning as opposed to reading from a book, so my goal was to be someone who shapes our culture. Someone who can direct anything from music videos to performances. My dreams are big, even though I don\u2019t know if I will do well. Namjoon has stated once that Yoongi\u2019s breadth of knowledge is very broad (something to that effect, I can\u2019t find the exact quote). This is a product of Ni making connections and intuitively understanding how things work without actually needing much background information on it. Speaking of Namjoon, he\u2019s also commented on how Yoongi helps him get in touch with his more philosophical side - a spiritual, Ni-like trait. I really need to thank Suga hyung. Sometimes when I see Suga hyung, I really think I should go into introspection. His existence is like a mirror. People are always easily limited by themselves or by those around them. But after talking with hyung, he makes me ponder about what kind of person I am. (The comment about Yoongi being his mirror is very interesting because I personally think that Namjoon\u2019s an INFJ, and INFJ/INTJs are known to be mirror types to each other, but that\u2019s another time)  Extroverted Thinking (Te) The auxiliary function expresses itself more prominently (than the dominant function) for introverts because it\u2019s an extroverted function. Yoongi\u2019s drive for efficiency is pretty undeniable, from being the MC in BTS Run episodes, to using up his time productively. I write songs while going back and forth on the airplane, and I worked [on music] back at the hotel room after our concerts are done. Now the second half of the work is almost finished, and today after this interview is over I\u2019ll go back to work more. Yoongi is often the one who reminds the group to get back on track, and to make sure that they\u2019re focused on their goal. It is apparent even in the way he talks - he rationalizes his statements with evidence from the world outside rather than inside (unlike a Ti user). In his lyrics, he will often use contemporary references and metaphors, building on from an idea in order to explain his vision, instead of creating something new. This is also a testament to him using Ni-Te.  A very strong evidence that he uses Te is that he prioritizes what needs to be done rather than his own feelings (what he wants to do). A fan once asked me \u201cWhat comes first- what you want to do, or what you have to do?\u201d and I think what you have to do comes first. I\u2019m not in the situation where I can say that I can\u2019t do it, and I\u2019m not so inflexible that I will say I won\u2019t do it, just to safe my pride. But there is one thing I can\u2019t give up- being honest with my music. I only write about my own experiences. Introverted Feeling (Fi) Yoongi is well known for not being afraid to express himself. He knows what he wants and who he is, and does not compromise this. One of his worries in the past was losing his identity. What has been the biggest change between the underground rapper Min Yoongi and Min Suga? Suga: That has been my worry lately. When I look back, I\u2019ve seen and learned a lot between those times. At the time, I thought everything I did was the best, including my music, so I think I grew a lot. But I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not as sharp as I was before, so I\u2019m worried that I lost my original color. - I don\u2019t worry about others. Sometimes it comes out in my lyrics- \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d I don\u2019t really like worrying about what others think of me, so I want to avoid worrying about it if I can. I want to just keep living how I\u2019ve been living up until now. This below is pretty much Yoongi.  Source : How You Use Introverted Feeling Based on Its Location in Your Function Stack - Psychology Junkie Extroverted Sensing (Se) The inferior function tends to express itself in more unhealthy ways. For INTJs, Se can mean being more observant in order to assist Te and Ni in achieving what they want, or it can be an unhealthy fixation on physical sensations, especially when the individual is stressed. It can also be expressed through an appreciation for living in the moment, the aesthetics (fashion). I honestly don\u2019t know much about this function myself, but here\u2019s a piece of evidence I can find. I don\u2019t really buy expensive clothes, but I pay close attention when buying accessories. Earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings- I like them all. Lately, I\u2019ve been collected basketball shoes that I\u2019ve liked since elementary school. After only working for a year, my heart is empty, so I do this to fill the void.  Some other INTJ traits that Yoongi displays : High introversion - It\u2019s an absolutely necessary time for me. There have been times that I\u2019ve sat alone in my recording studio for 10 hours. Although to be honest I was just goofing off for 8 hours and working for 1 hour. (laughs) It\u2019s important for me to have time where I can calmly organize my thoughts in a room by myself. I get overwhelmed if I\u2019m just running around without any of that kind of time.Independent and perfectionist - Since I\u2019ve done everything on my own from one to ten, my greed seems to be getting a little bigger. I also have the kind of personality where I really can\u2019t abide doing things roughly. I focus on the highest point of completion. In particular, when I made the tracklist, I worried a lot. About how I should put it together for flow and how to clearly convey the stories that I wanted to include. It\u2019s a mixtape I made meticulously as if it were a whole album.Sarcastic, dry humor (various BTS Run episodes and interviews show this)Has trouble with his emotional side - T tends to be more better at hiding feelings, an INFP would have trouble keeping it in. The excerpt below is from his letter about his vacation to Kobe. In this he talks about his difficulties in dealing with his feelings and how he tends to avoid them. (@letmesuga) | Twitter Finally, the last thing I wanna add to this (a little too) long post about Yoongi being an INTJ is that I relate to him quite a lot, so it was fairly easy to make the connection. I\u2019ve actually written an answer about that. However, I\u2019m open to debate and any corrections, for I don\u2019t claim to be an MBTI expert, just a nerd with too much time on her hands. I might have explained the functions a little broadly in this post, so yeah. Thanks for reading.

            "answer_text": "I know this is a late reply, but please hear me out, on a different perspective of Suga being INFP. Many people label Suga as INTJ, perhaps because of his rather unfeeling and cold nature? They took it as a direct result of the \u2018Thinking\u2019 among the four functions. However, my argument here is that just as easily, he could be an INFP. INFP\u2019s dominant function, as I will explore below, is \u201cIntroverted Feeling\u201d. Because of that, emotions which INFP experience in such startling detail is buried within them, unlike for example, the almost identical but actually different INFJ, which have \u201cExtroverted Feeling\u201d. INFP are unable to express the emotions on the surface, but instead relies on other outputs like the arts, which our Daegu man here does. Because it's an introverted function, it's hard to observe it in people. It's taking place in side the mind where others can't see it. Choice of career Suga has always wanted to be a music producer, even though I am sure he knew what risks are involved here. He fought against his parents for this position, just because it was the dream he always had. This is a dominant Fi trait - Introverted Feeling deals with morals and what the person truly believes. Fi becomes easy to observe is when it's in its negative aspect and people are acting selfishly and emotionally. Artistic creativity INFP is one of the most creative personalities out there. More specifically, INFPs are artistically creative. Writing, painting, making music\u2026 INFPs have an extremely vivid imagination and famous people of INFP personality are either charitable or artistically creative. Some examples: Shakespeare, Tolkien, Bjork, Alicia Keys. On the other hand, INTJs focus more on logic. You can find a number of politicians and scientists in the INTJ category. Examples: Putin, Elon Musk, Colin Powell, Samantha Power. Suga as rapper, music producer and photographer, definitely leans towards the INFP category. Idealism Idealism is arguably one of the greatest traits of INFP, so much that on the 16-personality website, the first line of INFP stated: Mediator personalities are true idealists. and Suga is clearly one. In \u201cThe Last\u201d: The conflict with ideal, my head hurts. You would notice that Suga is comparing his \u2018ideal\u2019 world with the real world, and not getting a result out of it. This is something which happens to many INFPs, and one of the main reasons why INFPs have the highest rate of depression. INTJs are also idealists, but it is not one of the outstanding traits. It is not something that screams \u2018I am INTJ.\u2019 Perfectionism Perfectionism is a trait of both INFP and INTJ. However, INFP tends to focus more on where they are interested in and often neglect the others (or simply not care) whereas INTJ is more well-rounded. They set extremely high standards for themselves on practically everything. Suga had said himself to be a perfectionist, and he is, with his music. I think all would agree he is extremely dedicated to his career. However, Suga do not put in that much effort in other areas, which is an INFP trait. You would see that he is insanely dedicated to his career while other things, not so much. For example, in the Not Today filming, the members were supposed to be shot down(?) and after that, Suga had said that: I can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m not an actor. It\u2019s okay. That is how an INFP would react, while INTJ would still push themselves if they feel that they are not doing that well. INTJ sets extremely high standards for themselves. Willingness to help other people reach their potential/valuing harmony This is quite an INFP characteristic, and one of the more well-known ones. INTJs are not typically classified with this trait. Suga has an altruistic nature, and always willing to raise other people to a greater height. Suga and Jimin\u2019 s interactions are a perfect example of this. Suga saw a lot of potential in Jimin musically and thus, had helped Jimin to utilize it. There are many examples of Suga raising Jimin to his full potential, and I believe that this is a well known fact. Suga also values harmony among the members. For example, in a Burn The Stage episode, Jin and Taehyung had an argument in which Suga was the one who tried to bring them to a peaceful conclusion. -This is all. And thank you for reading till the end, it is quite long. I just wanted to prepare a comprehensive answer. ",
