            "answer_text": "In addition to the famous story of the Don Giovanni overture, the creation of Mozart\u2019s 36th Symphony, the \u201cLinz\u201d, K. 425 may also fall into this category. The composer arrived in the city of Linz at 9 AM on October 30, where he was a guest of Count von Thun. Sometime that day or the next, the Count suggested to Mozart that he present a concert of his music on November 4. The concert was to include a symphony. Mozart wrote to his father on October 31: \u201cOn Tuesday, I am giving a concert in the theater here, and as I have not a single symphony with me, I am writing a new one at breakneck speed, which must be finished by that time. Well, I must close, because I really must set to work.\u201d The Symphony, therefore, was clearly completed some time no later than the morning of November 4, which would have barely allowed time for the copyists to prepare part scores for the orchestral musicians. Given Mozart\u2019s characteristic treatment of deadlines, it is quite possible that the Linz Symphony was finally completed on the day of it\u2019s premiere. ",

            "answer_text": "Brian is correct that the Don Giovanni Overture is the one that the story is about.  There is also the case of his last piano concerto where, at the first performance, written parts had been made for the orchestra but he had not finished writing out the piano part, so he played from memory. He never did finish it off, and the published score has a few places where the piano part shows what would be the top note or the bottom  note of a virtuoso passage, and the pianist is supposed to fill it out. Not many dare. ",
