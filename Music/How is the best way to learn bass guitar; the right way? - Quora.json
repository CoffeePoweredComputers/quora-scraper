            "answer_text": "Work on your fingering, muting and slapping technique on both hands a disciplined way, preferably with a metronome, and do not go too far before getting a professional to check your technique. Practice does not make perfect, practice makes permanent.  If you get too used to lazy  ways to play the bass, you may enjoy yourself at the start, but you will plateau quickly.  And from that point, you will have to unlearn your bad habits, which is a long, painful process that many people never fully overcome. ",

            "answer_text": "Aside from the obvious (a good teacher, practice tons), I would strongly suggest that you get into a band as early as possible. (IMO) bass is an instrument that is easy to play \"OK\", yet incredibly difficult to master.  The true masters may have chops for days, but most of their work is playing the appropriate part to support the song and the band.  And those parts are rarely that technically challenging.  They're simply right for the song. Bass playing requires listening and teamwork, and it's very difficult to practice those skills on your own.   In many places, bassists are in short supply, and being \"OK\" will get you a gig.  If that happens, open your ears, work your tail off, get symbiotic with the drummer, and you will get better fast.
