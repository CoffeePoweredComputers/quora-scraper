            "answer_text": "If you use someone else\u2019s recording in your recording you automatically are plagiarizing no matter how short or unrecognizable it is. That is called a sample. If you use the same or similar melody, unique chords or lyrics in your song that are unique and recognizable from someone else\u2019s song that is plagiarism. That is called an interpolation.
