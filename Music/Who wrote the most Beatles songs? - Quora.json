            "answer_text": "Original question: Who wrote the MOST Beatles songs. TL;DR Probably John. It\u2019s quite difficult to unscramble this egg. According to the Wiki pagethere are 280 songs, including 73 covers. But others say there are 209 original songs List of songs recorded by the Beatles - Wikipedia Legally, of course it\u2019s the \u201cLennon/McCartney\u201d songwriting partnership, but we know that many of the songs were really written by either John or Paul. Some think that Lennon wrote 61 songs credited to ''Lennon-McCartney'' entirely by himself, and McCartney composed 43 on his own. Lennon had a hand in composing 84.55 of the 209 songs recorded by the Beatles, and McCartney 73.65, according to the Chicago tribune. THE BEATLES BOX SCORE: JOHN OUTHITS PAUL Which gives John the upper hand - by volume. But, what constitutes a Beatles song? Is revolution just one song? Or three? Is \u201cSun King/Polythene Pam, Mr Mustard/She came in through the bathroom window?\u201d one song or four? Does the Dog whistle track on Sgt Peppers count? We probably can say that George is third and Ringo Fourth. Maybe. George Martin wrote some stuff that appears on a Beatles LP (Yellow Submarine flipside). Does that count? EDIT: The question has now been merged improperly. Grrrr. ",

            "answer_text": "THE BEATLES BOX SCORE: JOHN OUTHITS PAUL Dowlding`s research revealed that Lennon and McCartney shared the workload on ONLY (about) 17 songs. Most Beatles songs were written solely by one or the other. Fascinating. Is this a commentary on the writing team of Lennon/McCartney? John Lennon wrote 61 songs credited to ''Lennon-McCartney'' entirely by himself, and Paul McCartney composed 43 on his own. All told, Lennon had a hand in composing 84.55 of the 209 songs recorded by the Beatles, and McCartney 73.65. George Harrison was a distant third, with 22.15 credits, and Ringo Starr fourth with 2.7. (That adds up to 183.05; the rest were covers of other artists` songs.) ",
