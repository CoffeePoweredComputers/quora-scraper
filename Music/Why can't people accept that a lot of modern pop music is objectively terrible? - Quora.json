            "answer_text": "First of all, \u2018objectively terrible\u2019 is a completely subjective opinion so you've managed to undercut what is a really deep question by trying to sell your viewpoint as fact. Qualifying your \u2018question\u2019 with \u2018Art is subjective\u2019 doesn't change anything. Ok, with that little bit of calling you out behind us, here's my opinion on the matter. My entire career as a studio / touring musician has challenged me and forced me to stay open to all forms of music lest I become a dinosaur, irrelevant, outdated, antiquated and ultimately broke $. The older I get the more I have to work at staying curious and accepting of any and all music. I have worked with the biggest pop artists over the last 20 years and each time I have to find a way to connect with their music so I can offer something to the performance. It's not always easy but I have to find a way to overcome the urge to reject something just because it doesn't sound sweet to my ear at first. Just like going to the gym and staying active becomes mere physical maintenance as we age, so too our mental and emotional outlook must be excercised and kept in good working order. It's so tempting to cover ourselves in the familiar, in our own wisdom, our own opinions, in what we KNOW to be irrefutable and factual. I get it, this makes a scary and uncertain world seem less so when we feel like we've figured out what's good and what's bad. As far as music itself is concerned, imagine Beethoven listening to The Kinks \u2018You Really Got Me\u2019. What would he say? It's not hard to imagine him thinking what is this stupid, horrible, noisy, ugly crap?! Take your favorite current pop song, something YOU consider to be quality music, and imagine playing it for Duke Ellington or Claude DeBussy. What would their reaction be? No matter how we try to qualify what's good and bad it always comes back to a subjective opinion. Sometimes we just can't relate to certain music because we aren't part of the cultural landscape that it represents. We don't get where it's coming from and what's really going on emotionally behind the sound and lyrics. I think the advance of technology has been a huge factor in separating classic music, say about pre 1982, from newer music. It's completely changed how music is created. Sampling, using bits of audio from other sources and used to create a new audio collages, really starts to bend the definition of making music: is music only valid if we\u2019re playing a traditional instrument or is creating chords, melodies and sounds through other means equally valid? Drum machines and keyboards, whose patterns and performances are programmed into a computer, allow someone who isn't an accomplished physical player but still has musical ideas, to create music by entering the data into a sequencer. Pitch correction software which can also adjust rhythm and timing has completely changed the process of recording vocals. Digital editing allows the wrangling of audio way beyond what was possible on tape machines. Then you have DJs who are playing preexisting tracks and mixing them with other tracks, adding sound FX, and vocal bits, etc. I can't stand Lil\u2019 Yachty, for example. I think the tracks are boring and the lyrics are inane at best. It's lightweight silly music to me. But someone else might think it's incredible. Who am I to say, with all my musical expertise and experience, that a fan of Lil\u2019 Yachty is wrong and has terrible taste in music? There's always music that stands the rest of time and music that fades away quickly and is more or less disposable. Maybe music today reflects a faster paced world and is in fact made to be consumed and disposed of more quickly. Maybe the devaluation of music in terms of royalties paid and the access to free music via YouTube and other digital sources has changed the quality of music as a whole. Maybe the fact that more people than ever are creating music has watered down the talent pool. Bottom line to me is that it seems irrelevant to even try to make the comparison of today vs. yesterday so far as better or worse is concerned. Don't get me wrong, I sometimes listen to Queen and think \u2018Dam! They just don't make rock records like this anymore. Listen to this dude sing with no auto tune, listen to those layers of harmonies, the exquisite guitar work, the masterful and unique songwriting, the engineering and production, the final mix\u2026etc\u2019 What's the point of comparing that to Kendrick Lamar\u2019s latest single? Better or worse? They both exist, listen to what moves you and grooves you. ",

            "answer_text": "Someone commented about being educated and uneducated. I can remember when music was a very important curriculum in the educational system across the US but over the years, programs have been cut, instruments taken away, certain Politians views on how much funds are used for music education and the list goes on and on! I will say this, the more you cut out the more pertinent information is being left out. I've traveled to other countries where it is vital for bands to play their instruments and to know how to sing without added effects. What I mean by that is the audience will walk away or complain because they were brought up on the true art form of music. Now you get to where corporations (record companies) know there is lots of money to be made and it's usually at exploiting the artist for personal financial gain. Pop music has its place as does any other form of music but I feel when you leave out pertinent information on educating people, especially children, then you have several people who are unaware of what good music is and now the masses will accept what you put into their ears because they no longer have anything to reference.
