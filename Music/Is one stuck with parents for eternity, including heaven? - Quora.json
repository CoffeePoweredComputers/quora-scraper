            "answer_text": "A2A Is one stuck with parents for eternity, including heaven? There seems to be a bit of confusion here. Everyone who goes to heaven will be in perfect harmony with each other. We all will be perfect and will get along just fine, loving everyone. The question is will any of you get to heaven? Perhaps you should have a close look at what it takes to get there. Here is a basic outline of how to get to heaven: Repent of your sins and become born again as described in John chapter three, the central theme of the whole Bible is in that chapter. Then live a life that is pleasing to God to the best of your ability. Do not think that you can go on sinning as you have in the past, see 1 John 3:7-10. God knows that we will always have the sin nature, he made provision for that in 1 John 1:8\u201310. Then see James 2:14-24 on how you must have good works to show the change that has been made in your life. Only the finished work of Christ can save you, but your faith is dead without good works. Many places in the Bible it says we will be judged by our works....so getting that right is important. Mix in with all this sharing Jesus with others, see Romans 10:9-13. Then read the New Testament daily to learn how to live a life that pleases God. Blessings. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. NO! The parents, family, friends, and everyone else you know, you may never see again after this life. Depending upon our karmas during this life, we may be elevated to the heavenly planets to enjoy for thousands to millions of years, or degraded to the hellish planets, to suffer for thousands to millions of years, or, we may reincarnate immediately into our next life. Our destinations are dependent upon our own karmas, attachments, and desires. God has said that whatever a person thinks at the time of death, that state they will attain without fail. Because death is scary and painful, our mind will seek shelter in whatever it is most attached to (note, this isn\u2019t just what we like the most, but what we think of the most). So, if we are too attached to our dog, for example, we may attain the body of a dog in our next life. Or, if we have strong hatred towards an individual, we may end up joining them in a family in our next life. The ultimate goal of life, however, is to rekindle our complete dependence on, surrender to, and love of God. When one achieves this, not only do they escape all of the bodily designations in this temporary world, but permanently attain to God\u2019s kingdom for eterntiy. The easiest way to do this is to chant God\u2019s holy names. We chant the Hare Krishna mantra, which was given by God specifically for this fallen and atheistic age. However, one may chant any authorized name of God (Krishna, Christ, Allah, etc\u2026). Because God is absolute, He is in His name, and when we chant His names, it is like the genuine crying of a child for its mother. Hare Krishna! ",
