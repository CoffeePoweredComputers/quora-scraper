            "answer_text": "Martins have a fantastic sound if you like the Martin sound. They have a very distinctive upper mid-range, which really doesn\u2019t have any parallels among other guitar manufacturers. Yamaha makes a more neutral guitar. Early Yamahas, which are extremely collectible, had a very open, more bass-heavy sound, but later Yamahas, including current models, don\u2019t have that indefinable quality to the same extent. Takamine makes good guitars, but I personally find them to have a heavy sound, in the sense that you have to play quite hard to get a good output. This is less important when amplified. If you\u2019re a player who naturally plays hard, a Takamine may help control the sound. They are relatively well-balanced. If you are looking for the Martin sound, then you need a Martin. On the other hand, you may find Martins to be bottom-light, and intrusive if that upper-middle happens to coincide with the rich harmonics of your singer\u2019s voice. At a similar price point, Martins don\u2019t sound that much more amazing than Yamahas and Takamines\u2014it\u2019s the expensive ones that really have that defining quality. Alternatives at the high-end Martin price point which are worth looking at are: Taylor\u2014balanced sound with excellent playabilityGuild\u2014big sound, goes with anything, tend to be top-lightOvation\u2014less popular than they were, but a very clear upper register that always worksI\u2019ve never really found Gibsons to be as good as other instruments at the same price-point, though there\u2019s no doubt you can get some very good Gibson guitars. Fender acoustics are not really in the same league, though I\u2019ve often recommended them to new players. Arias and Ibanez are always worth looking at. Every acoustic guitar is different, and the best thing is to try all the acoustic guitars at the price point you can afford in a good guitar shop, and pick the one that sounds best, irrespective of what\u2019s on the label.

            "answer_text": "I have recorded music with a Takamine, Gibson, Guild, Epiphone, JB Player and Vega Guitars, (Martin). I can guarantee that even the greatest sound engineers you can pick could not tell the difference between any of these recordings. I would gladly send you mp3 files and you can take a guess at which guitar was used on each song. Well you will never get even one right. Yes some really expensive guitars have an amazing sound if you were standing five feet away and a great player is performing. However, once you connect into a PA system any perceptible difference disappears. Performance is based 90% on the player and guitar setup. Nothing is wrong with your desire to own and play a Martin Guitar. My first guitar was a Vega. Martin Guitar purchased Vega and started making them in Japan and then quit around 1978. I know to you Vega appears to be some obscure maker but in the 1950\u2019s it was considered a top line acoustic guitar and their banjo\u2019s were to die for. The Vega I have is basically a hand made D-18 made in Japan with a Vega Headstock. It was the most accurate made guitar I have ever owned and the sound was pure Martin old school. So yes Martin makes great looking and sounding guitars. However, my teacher was a Gibson person so I ended up in the Gibson Epiphone Tent. I have a couple Guild\u2019s, one Gretsch and a Strat, these are Fender Tent. We are living in a great time where every original flavor of guitars is still available plus a few newer ones. You basically pick the flavor you like and well start playing and never never quit until they close the lid on the coffin, Patrick Ferrin Master Guitar Player, Slide, Fingerstyle, acoustic electric and songwriter.
