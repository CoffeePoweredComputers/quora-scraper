            "answer_text": "In the Western tonal system, each octave is divided into 12 notes a semitone apart. We can use any one of these notes as the tonic note of a minor key, meaning that there are 12 possible minor keys. To find the notes in any particular minor key, we can start from the tonic, step up two semitones, step up one semitone, step up two semitones, step up two semitones, step up one semitone and finally step up two semitones. This gives me a series of seven notes that makes up the natural minor scale of the key. For example, if we choose the note F as our tonic, we get the seven notes F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db and Eb. (Depending on how the notes are used to make up melodies and harmonies, it\u2019s common to find both the sixth and the seventh notes sharpened [raised] by one semitone.) The saxophone is a fully chromatic instrument across all of its range. In other words, it can play all 12 notes of the Western system. It can therefore play in any of the 12 minor keys. Some are easier than others! ",

            "answer_text": "As Christopher points out, there are 12 minor keys. How many you can play really depends on your mastery of your instrument. Starting with the easier, more accessible keys, plan a daily regimen that includes the scale, the arpeggio, closely related chord arpeggios, the three minor pentatonic modes, and some familiar piece you can play by ear in each new key. Include this 8\u201312 minutes in your daily practice and you will be able to play in \u201call of \u2018em\u201d. ",
