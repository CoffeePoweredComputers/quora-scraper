            "answer_text": "A soft definition of phrasing is that it has to do with the way a singer breaks up the natural musical or lyrical \u2018phrases\u2019 in a song. Given a melody and a set of words, how do you, as a singer tend to express them? Do you hold certain notes/words to extend them over the barline? Do you wait until halfway through the measure to start a phrase? Maybe you draw out one particular word for emphasis, which changes the lie of the line over the musical structure. This is a broad definition, but phrasing is sort of a broad concept, and tends to envelop a lot of different musical devices. ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t sing words. The first step to phrasing is to look at syllables rather than words. You sing the pieces of words rather than the words themselves. Break the song up into syllables and then group the pieces to fit with the rhythm of the song. Some pieces are stretched out others are joined to pieces of other words. There are many possible combinations in phrasing a song. Some work better than others. For example: I am\u2026- a pil\u2026 \u2026. grim\u2026 and-a stran\u2026..ger\u2026 \u2026 Tra\u2026 \u2026veling through\u2026 this wear\u2026- i some land\u2026 \u2026 ",
