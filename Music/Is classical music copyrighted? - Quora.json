            "answer_text": "If by \u201cClassical Music.\u201d you mean historical musical works such as Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, DeBussy, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, etc., it is ALL Public Domain. If you are simply referring to the style of music then Public Domain rights basically apply to all published music from 1923 or earlier. This rule applies to musical works (Sheet music or published compositions). For actual recordings by an artist, see the info below. A recording is not the same as published works. So if you wanted to play your own version of Bach\u2019s music in a movie you were making, you can freely do so, but if, for example, you wanted to play Daniel Lozakovich\u2019s Violin Concerto recorded version of Bach in your movie, you would have to get the rights from him or his recording company (whoever owns the rights to the recording). Anything after 1923 is only Public Domain if placed there by artist, or after a certain number of years depending on Country. The EU and Canada observe a 50 year limit, while in the U.S., on October 2018, president Donald Trump signed the Music Modernization Act, which will bring sound recordings into the public domain either 95 years after they were released or 120 years after they were recorded, whichever comes first. So in the U.S., songs recorded before 1923 will expire on October 11, 2021; recordings made between 1923 and 1946 will be protected for 100 years after release; recordings made between 1947 and 1956 will be protected for 110 years; and all recordings made from 1957 to February 15, 1972 will have their protection terminate on February 15, 2067 (Again, this applies to recordings, not the music itself, which all published works before 1923 are Public Domain). The only exception to the pre-1923 rules is if someone buys the rights to a song, which has happened, but it is extremely rare and attempts are usually unsuccessful. You may remember a recent event where some company bought the rights to, Happy Birthday, and for a few years it couldn\u2019t sung on TV, etc, or even in a Facebook post without someone paying a fee, or being sued. It was eventually overturned by the courts based on the pre-1923 rules. ",

            "answer_text": "Some other complications: The work may be in the public domain, but the edition may not be. Any edition of a classical work published after 1923 could be subject to a copyright by the publisher of the edition. Of course you can play from this edition without fear; but don\u2019t think you can xerox it and hand it out to people on the street corner for free. :)Arrangements of classical works can be copyrighted. So, if I publish a simplified version of a Bach keyboard work, or transcription for guitar, or a choral arrangement, you can\u2019t use that without my permission.",
