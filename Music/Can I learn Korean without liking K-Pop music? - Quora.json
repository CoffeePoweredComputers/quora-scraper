            "answer_text": "The better question here should be, 'Do you actually 'LIKE' Korean?' The thing about language is, no matter how dedicated you choose to be at the start, if you don't give yourself a passionate reason why you're learning the language, you're sure to get bored and make a switch. The Korean language, much like any other language, is learnt with simple steps of words, to phrases, to sentences. From this point, you know you're already speaking the language.,but what keeps you going through this phase, is the vision you have in your head that expresses the passion you have for the language. You've decided to minor in Korean, but you feel hesitant to proceed. Why? Because there's a small part of you that tells you, that you'll be inconsistent along the way. That you might not be able to give enough to get the most out of the language. You don't need KPOP to learn Korean. It's a language. But for efficient learning, and familiarity with the phonetics of the language, it's recommended to listen to KPOP. It's kinda like mnemonics that help to improve cognitive ability, and improve your capacity to retain and recall info. It's fun, it helps you get used to the language, and the have talented artists that entertain you whilst you learn. Talk about learning with a fun experience! You might not like KPOP. The sight of white feminine boys in shorts might disgust you. Heck, you might not even like Korean, but If you do choose to learn Korean, it will be like learning any other language along with all the rigorous learning concepts that will further stress you, IF you don't learn without KPOP (or K-Dramas) Try KPOP today, and you'll see the effects it'll have on you.

            "answer_text": "Most definitely, you can. I learn Japanese without liking and watching/listening to Japanese music or anime (le gasp!) And I\u2019m doing well. In fact, a lot of people in my class who love anime and J-Pop have really bad grades in the class and struggle a lot despite it all. It really depends more on the effort you put into learning, not just absorbing in pop culture. I even draw in manga style without liking the above. I would suggest you try to watch Korean movies or dramas though if you can help it because hearing the language is reallllly helpful to learning (when I USED to like anime back in middle school I learned so much Japanese that I forgot now even though I\u2019m taking the class). Music however? Nah. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a little hard to learn proper grammar, inflection, etc when just listening to the music\u2026 You\u2019ll be fine. Just be prepared to be in a class with a lot of K-Pop lovers\u2026 or to have people assume that you love K-Pop because you\u2019re taking Korean. I have both these problems in Japanese class\u2026 people don\u2019t believe me when I say I\u2019ve only ever seen about 6 short anime series in my life, and the last one I watched was about 3 years ago\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "According to my personal experience, while listening to Korean music, you just enjoy the exciting rhythm instead of focusing on language itself. This theory can be applied in many foreign language songs including Chinese, Japanese and other oriental language. Listening to Korean songs or watching films and variety shows can be a recreational assistant way to learn Korean instead of main methods, especially for the language beginner. Honestly speaking, there is no direct connection between listening to loads of songs and studying one foreign language well. On the one hand, lyrics are not common words that can be used in daily life. It would be weird to answer questions using lyrics from songs. On the other hand, some songs mixed Korean English and native slang which are difficult for beginner to understand their meanings. Therefore, while listening to Korean music, you just enjoy the exciting rhythm instead of focusing on vocabulary and syntax. Korean as an oriental language is different from western languages. In the last century, Korean government gradually abolished the use of Chinese character in daily life as well as most official documents, and written Korean has evolved to an alphabetic language. It is much easier for you to know the pronunciation of each word, but it is difficult to know their exact meanings which only can be understood by the whole sentence. If you decided to minor in Korean, the fundamental stuff is to master the most basic pronunciation, grammar and syntax rather than listen to music as a main approach. By the way, after having completed basic language courses, you can watch some variety shows to improve your sensitivity and proficiency to Korean, which is more useful and efficient compared with listening to music. There are many benefits of watching well-elaborated Korean variety shows. You can be familiar with the history, custom, current fashion and behavior style of Korean that can help you understand language better. The glamour of some Korean host can break the cultural divergence and shock your heart. I believe programmes hosted by Yu Jae Seok will not make you disappointed. I am curious about now that you are not interested in K-pop, what your reasons are for studying Korean. After all, most people around me study Korean for enjoying the pleasure K-pop brings to them better. - ",

You like romance, there\u2019s sweet stories of two ridicullously attractive people fell in love with each other in architectures 101, or when you like thrill and crime stories more than romance you can watch signal for drama and crime scere for variety.

I also passed the highest level of Korean proficiency test (TOPIK). And I don't like K-POP. I never did. I am also not a fan of Korean drama. I like some Korean movies but for their great stories and not because they are Korean movies. I hated Korean food until 5 years back. Now I have developed the taste and just love it. :) But I like Korea, its culture and language and that's enough motivation to learn Korean. But sometimes people also learn the languages of the countries they really hate, because their job requires them to do so or sometimes because they love the language linguistically and so on. So nothing should stop you from learning Korean if you want to. All the best! ",

Also, there are other genres of Korean music out there besides pop. You can also watch Korean TV shows, like K-dramas and variety shows. Those might be more useful considering you can see the facial expressions and gestures that go along with what is being said, which may help you learn new phrases easier. ",

There are other types of music as well, its not as if all koreans listen to only pop. If music isnt your thing, so be it.

Maybe I would watch movies or dramas more because those are what I like. I don't actually quite get the idea that people \"should\" learn Korean through K-pop. Its grammar and spellings are not even often correct, and I don't think most of the lyrics are healthy. ",

Keep looking for the kind you want, I\u2019m sure you can find something, unless you don\u2019t like it because of the sound of the language. Watching Korean movies and tv shows is also a good way to get to know the sound of the language. There are apps you can download, and meet korean people to speak with. K-pop is not the only way ",

Some idols tend to pronounce words differently in order for them to flow well with the song. There are plenty of other sources online like books, videos, Korean shows, etc. You don't have to learn Korean with the music alone. ",

If you are learning Korean language as a complete beginner, as a resource, you could always try out flashcard/quiz vocabulary builders like beginnerkorean app or StartFromZero_Korean app. Alternatively, once you are more adept in the language you could use more advanced Hangul learning tools such as TOPIK Locker app to practice your vocabulary.
