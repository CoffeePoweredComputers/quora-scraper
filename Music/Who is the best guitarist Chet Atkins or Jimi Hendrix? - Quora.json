            "answer_text": "Two extremely gifted guitar players on the \u201cMount Rushmore\u201d of American guitar players. Chet with his long tenured career as The Greatest Country picker (while also heading up RCA\u2019s Nashville Division for over 20 years). And the meteoric James Marshall Hendrix, considered by many the Father of not only Psychedelic Rock but also the first real \u201cmodern\u201d electric guitar player. Worlds apart, but highly influential cats. Jimi did his in 4\u20135 years while Chet had a nice long career of over 50 years. We called him \u2018Mr.Guitar\u2019 and \u2018The Country Gentleman\u2019, but Chet never got credited for being a real fan of Jazz, Blues, and Rock music (which he was). Many Americans don\u2019t know that he was also a gifted Flamenco guitarist! So much so, that in some South American countries, he is known for his Flamenco guitar playing and not his Country picking!  above: from 1975, Atkins plays Scott Joplin\u2019s \u201cThe Entertainer\u201d on TV. Chet is credited as being one of the first real proponents of the Modern Country sound. His guitar playing, production skills, and music business savvy, literally rescued Country Music from being considered \u201cirrelevant\u201d to music fans in the 1960\u2019s. Atkins helped create the Nashville Sound, and never received the props for that. Nor did he get credit for introducing Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, and Jerry Reed to Country music fans.Jimi will always be known for taking what he learned on the \u201cChitlin\u2019 Circuit\u201d as a backing musician, dressing it up in psychedelic clothes, and turning it up to \u201c11\u201d. He took London by storm, and then the rest of the world. His debut album, \u201cAre You Experienced?\u201d by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, is considered one of the greatest debut albums ever! And many people still consider his version of \u2018The Star Spangled Banner\u2019 at Woodstock in 1969, the finest (and final) moment of the 60\u2019s Flower Power Movement. Jimi introduced many firsts to Pop culture, and his death at 27 was considered a real loss to Rock music lovers worldwide. After all is said and done, I like Chet Atkins better in another apples to oranges question. I think his 14 Grammy Awards and 50 years of playing are tops in our lifetime. ",
