            "answer_text": "Her songs are very successful because she has an excellent personality, spirit, maturity yet sense of humour and is so happy now. She works really hard with her brother Finneas O\u2019Connell to create music that they enjoy and like, rather than what they think people will enjoy. This way they please themselves in their music and are motivated to continue. her songs are also so successful because when she works with her brother they don\u2019t need to be polite and gentle with opinions. I remember in an interview she said that, if either of them don\u2019t like something, they\u2019ll just say it sucks and move on and laugh about it. Also he doesn\u2019t want to change her music or make her create for a specific genre.  At the end, Finneas talks about not changing Billie\u2019s music. In summary, Finneas and Billie just complement each others styles so well and can share experiences freely to make amazingly successful music ",
