            "answer_text": "This is what the artist said about it  \"Um, this song I just wrote a little while ago, and someone told me they heard it on the radio today-- it just came out two days ago, and um... I wanted to write a song about this principle: the lower down you go to gain your momentum from, the higher up it will propel ya, but I couldn't think of a way to say that poetically... and I happened to stumble across this real obscure theological fact, and that is that Jesus was a cross maker. That really got in my head, and I knew I had to write a song about it. Same time, I was having a really unhappy romance with this guy: he was a bandit, and a heartbreaker. So one morning I woke up and realised that \"he's a bandit and a heartbreaker\" rhymes with \"but Jesus was a crossmaker\". And I knew that even that wretched bastard was not beyond redemption. It's true, it's true; I swear. It saved me, this song. It was writing this song or suicide, y'know?\" ",
