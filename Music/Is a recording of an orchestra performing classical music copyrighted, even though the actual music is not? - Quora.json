            "answer_text": "Yes. The recording of a music is protected under copyright in the US and all Berne Convention adhering countries. Berne Convention countries use the term \"neighbouring rights\" (\"droits voisins\" in French), as opposite to the \"author's rights\", as neighbouring rights protect the recording of the performer's performance, opposite to the author's rights that protect the author's work itself. It shall be considered that although a (formerly copyrighted) work may have fallen in the public domain due to the expiration of the term of protection, the recording may still be protected by the neighbouring rights (in the US system both neighbouring rights and authors right are unified under the term \"copyright\"). Duration of the copyright on a recording depends on each country's legislation (in the EU the term of protection for music recordings [artists' performances] is 70 years after the production of the recording [Directive 2011/77/EU modifying Directive 2006/116/EC], a term that shall not be confused - as it is different - with the term of protection on copyrighted works, that is 70 years after the year of death of the last surviving author).

            "answer_text": "As Todd said, yes, the recording is copyrighted even though the actual music may be in the public domain. Printed editions of public domain music can also be copyrighted by the editor/publisher. That is, if I prepare an edition of a Beethoven symphony from the basis of the composer's manuscripts and first editions, I can copyright my edition and place it on the market for sale even though the music itself is Beethoven's and not under copyright. Then I sell that edition to the orchestra, who records it and in turn sells the recording. ",
