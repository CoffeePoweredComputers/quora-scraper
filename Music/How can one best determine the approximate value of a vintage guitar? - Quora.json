            "answer_text": "It needs to appraised by an expert. Searching past sales on eBay (or Reverb) might give you half a clue, but you won\u2019t have any real comparisons of condition, or modifications etc. all of which affect the price. If you are talking about a *seriously* valuable guitar, you want a pretty accurate idea, don\u2019t you? Here in the UK I know, trust, and use Vintage & Rare Guitars in Bath (which is a couple of hours from where I am). There are not too many I could say the same about, to be honest. If it is very collectable put it in a specialist auction, with a reserve price. ",

            "answer_text": "There are clues! My 1968 Gibson Melody Maker has a slight area in the headstock where I could barely see the indents of the model number. My 1980 Ibanez Concorde has the label inside the guitar where it can be seen through the soundhole. My Fender Stratocaster has the numbers in the neck where it is screwed out of sight only to be seen when I remove the neck for minor adjustments. You may have to go hunting to find the serial numbers but I think that is one of the wonders of the guitar. Buried treasure, maybe not. A peek at the integrity and age of the instrument, that suits me fine! ",

The local music stores used to call me when they had something come in that may have vintage value. If you post here what you have, I can tell you approximately what it\u2019s worth. Full disclosure- I will not offer to buy whatever you may have at any price. ",
