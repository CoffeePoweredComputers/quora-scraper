            "answer_text": "It is a question of you, your personal history, your likes and dislikes in music, who you are, and your interests. If you hate country music, because you are not hearing into someone discuss how his horse left him again, you are probably not going to like ANY lyrics from any song. But bear in mind: The Lyrics are ONE thing, but the MUSIC is quite ANOTHER! Sometimes you listen to a song, and you say: Great Tune! But the lyrics suck! And sometimes you say the Lyrics would not be so bad if\u2026 but the music sucks! Moreover, some people were not meant to sing certain songs. I\u2019m sorry, but sometimes a singer something sings something, and you say to yourself: He knocked it our of the ball park! On the other hand, you might hear someone sing a certain song, and you will say: This guy RUINED this song. He can sing, but NOT this! It does not matter how old, how famous, how \u201cgood\u201d, how popular they are. The song has to \u201cFIT\u201d the singer\u2019s voice. And it helps if they ONLY sing and do not exaggerate. A singer can put a \u201ctwist\u201d on a song, and make it much better. Or, they can but a twist or \u201carrangement\u201d on a song, and ruin it completely, to the point where you want to throw up last week\u2019s lunch. So you see, it is YOU, but not JUST you. It is you, the tune, the music, the singer, even the musicians playing the background music. BUT WHAT makes it good? Ah, that, no one knows. It is like that judge said years ago about pornography: \u201cI cannot define it. But I know it, when I see it.\u201d And that is the thing about music (no lyrics), lyrics (as a poem), lyrics sung, without music, and lyrics sung with music. If it \u201cresonates with you\u201d, it is good. And do note: We are not all the same. There are some voices, that, for me, they could sing anything, and I would love it. Others will call their voice squeaky, and the lyrics trite, and boring. But there is nothing wrong with that! Love, and enjoy, and listen to what YOU Like. And let the other person, have what fits them. If we were all clones, we would all be in the Emperor\u2019s Dark Forces! And another thing. Some pieces of music, can have a number of lyrics attached to them. In other words, same tune, two or three different stories being told (sung). Search for Allan Sherman on Youtube. He was great a taking a piece of music, and doing some strange funny parody to it. Think also of Weird Al Yankovich. A lot of people do it. Take me. (Yah, a lot of people wish I would go away, and at my age, that is coming soon.) But I like some 50 songs about history, that this crazy Blonde re-mixed, and recycled from popular rock songs. SHE takes a song, like \u201c99 Red Balloons\u201d from Nena (Who I adore, but do NOT tell her!) and tells the Story of Beowulf. SHE takes Gaga\u2019s (droool!) \u201cBad Romance\u201d and tells the story of the French Revolution. She takes a Beatles song, and\u2026.. Here go see the music videos: historyteachers And here, some audio only, songs:Soundcloud audio files only: Historyteacherz You may like them. If so, those lyrics, those stories resonate with you. If you do not like them, then they are simply not for you. And you could say the same about Blondie (DRRROOOOOOL!), Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, Cher, Gaga, or Nena. The singer, the musicians, and the audience have to fit. And if they do not fit, why, as you know\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u201cYou must acquit!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The secret to a great song, both musically and lyrically is simple: storytelling: from \u201cYou\u2019ve Lost That Loving Feeling\u201d to \u201cI Will Survive\u201d to \u201cStreets of Gold\u201d to \u201cRumor Has It\u201d, the key lies in telling a compelling and emotionally heartfelt story. In \u201cI Will Survive\u201d Gloria Gaynor reflects on a past relationship that at first, leaves her vulnerable and insecure; when her ex returns to try and win her back, she realizes how dysfunctional their relationship was, and empowers herself to say \u201cNo more\u201d and not to take him back, proving to herself she is a resilient and strong woman. On Sting\u2019s \u201cFields of Gold\u201d, he conveys his undying love for his sweetheart by recounting past times spent together, and pledges his fidelity until the end. \u201cRumor Has It\u201d finds Adele confronting an ex who has traded her in for a younger model, but now realizes what a good thing he had, and let slip through his fingers. And on the Righteous Brothers hit, a love that has grown cold and distant is lamented (\u201cYou never close your eyes anymore/When I kiss your lips/And there\u2019s no tenderness like before in your fingertips\u2026.\u201d) Like the advice given to all writers, I suggest you write about what you know: it could be about past or present relationships, (as the majority of songs seem to be these days), but it could also be a song about social protest (Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cTalkin\u2019 Bout A Revolution\u201d, Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn In The USA\u201d); feeling the rhythm (Vicki Sue Robinson\u2019s \u201cTurn The Beat Around\u201d, Megan Trainor\u2019s \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d) or solidarity (Sister Sledge\u2019s \u201cWe Are Family\u201d or Merle Haggard & Willie Nelson\u2019s \u201cPancho & Lefty\u201d) So tell a story, tell it from the heart, and with feeling.
