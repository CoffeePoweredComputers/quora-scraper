            "answer_text": "An orchestra \"arranged as it is\" could mean a variety of things. Orchestras, both today and throughout history, have been arranged in any number of ways. The very creative conductor Leopold Stokowski experimented with a number of seating arrangements. At one time, Stokowski even arranged the Philadelphia Orchestra (see below from 1939, courtesy of the Stokowski Foundation) so that the wind section sat in front of the strings, with the double basses at the back. But it is true that today, the standard way of seating is strings arced in the front with winds behind and brass further behind them, often arced to the left or right. The percussion and auxiliary instruments are generally furthest to the rear or arced behind the brass on the sides.    Generally, however the placement of the various sections (strings, winds, brass, and percussion) is more-or-less pre-determined through tradition, history, and by the acoustical properties of the instruments themselves. From the origins of symphonies by Sammartini and the divertimenti of Mozart, the orchestral center originated in the string section. Simplistically speaking, layers of the orchestral cake were added from there. First came the winds, with responsive, sometimes supplementary musical lines. The introduction of brass and timpani followed. These 'outdoor' instruments were initially used in the orchestral context primarily as a cadential demarcation device, but later achieved more compositional independence. Even in the Romantic era, when works appeared that treated the orchestral sonority as more of an essentially unified palette, these sections continued to have independent function. The symphonies of Gustav Mahler, for instance, feature an incredible number of musicians on stage, sometimes used quite sparingly (i.e. the Nachtmusik movements of the Seventh Symphony). While the skill level of the musicians, acoustics and instrumental timbres must be taken into consideration, so must the nature of the style and writing of the composition being performed. Many passages in the Brahms symphonies, for instance, benefit from an antiphonal arrangement of the first and second violins, since the musical writing features what is essentially the interplay of their voices. In order to highlight these features, under certain situations it might be helpful to have the first and second violins split, across from one another (rather than next to one another) in order to bring out these characteristics. Of course, this depends on the circumstances; it is also true that one does not necessarily need to change the seating to effect the same outcome sonically. But sometimes, the added psychological effect is just as important. In the broad view, there are rarely, if ever, a single set of 'right' answers for this question, even for a particular set of circumstances. Placement of forces is a matter of musical considerations, practicality, style and taste. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, depending wether the orchestra's level is professional or is of student, each side of the arrangement has to be 'balanced' equally on each side of the concertmaster who is at the center because he has to be seen as he is in control of the art.The design of the room and stage is also taken into consideration, to make best use of the varying amplitudes in different corners of the room.The arrangement is divided into four groups, the strings , woodwind, brass and percussion respectively according to the level of loudness of their instrument.The quieter 'strings' like violin, viola, cello and double bass.The violins are split into two groups. First and the second. The first violins are virtually the leaders of the orchestra and are always on the left of the orchestra-conductor so they are closest to the audience.The stringed instruments is enclosed by the woodwinds that include  flute, oboe, clarinet and basson.The brass then follows that includes trumpet, trombone, french horn and tuba.This arrangement is finally completed by the percussion instruments. There might be variety depending on the technical requirements of the pieces they play and the bandconductor's taste. The overall effect of all these developments was to produce a bigger, richer sound, with greater timbral variety. Composers exploited these possibilities and in doing so yet further developed the orchestra. ",
