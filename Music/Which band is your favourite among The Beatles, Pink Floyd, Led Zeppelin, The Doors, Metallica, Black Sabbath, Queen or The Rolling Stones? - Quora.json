            "answer_text": "While all of the bands played a crucial role in the rock music scene, each has a different style of composing music and gives a different feel. Beatles' music is suited to all listeners, which according to me, is the reason the band is so popular. With its acoustic and pop elements and the oh-so-relatable lyrics and the amazing penmanship of Lennon and McCartney, Beatles have aptly been often called \"more famous than God\" Pink Floyd stirred a movement in the evolution of psychedelic rock  music. Compositional masterpieces are quite abundant in their music. They also incorporated opera and jazz into some of their tracks which I think is absolutely splendid. Black Sabbath holds a prominent position in the progeny of metal. And it's powerful ballads are unparalleled. The doors is one other phenomenal band, which along  with Jim Morrison's powerful voice and stage presence, has created waves in the psychedelic Era. That, with jazz style singing and revolutionary music has made the band hold an apex in classic rock. Led Zeppelin is  considered by many to be the best band that ever graced the earth. Look at the likes of Robert Plant, John Bonham, John Paul Jones and the ever awesome Jimmy Page. They're among the most important figures in the history of rock. Along with the powerful and soulful vocals by Plant, the mind boggling solos of Jimmy Page and the extremely skilled drumming by Bonham (who by the way is listed several times to be the best drummer that ever existed), they've reached unfathomable heights in terms of popularity, cult following and respect. Often experimenting with folk, rock n roll, and blues, they've blurred the concept of genre and went beyond just creating music - they created masterpieces. Rolling Stones  is one band that proved music can very well cross the realms of genres. Their pure rock n roll approach with psychedelic elements, combined with Jagger's eclectic and extraordinary style of singing and further, performing  have escalated their status of being one of the best bands to a movement in the Era of classic rock. Queen is the epitome of anthems and ballads. The spectrum of genres they have covered, the anthems they've made and the raw energy with which the band overtook the crowd and the listeners alike makes Queen one of the most revered bands of all time. With a frontman like Freddie Mercury - with a voice of a God, stage presence like no other - and a lead guitarist like Brian May and music that encompasses every subject and every style ever, Queen is undoubtedly the best pop rock band that the earth had the privilege to witness; and even this is saying too little. Only Queen can make a song about Fat Bottomed women and make it sound awesome (listen to Fat Bottomed Girls).  Nobody ever forgets \"We will rock you\" right? You can definitely see how  painstakingly difficult choosing a favorite band would be. ",

            "answer_text": "Some great answers here, and a question like this just proves to illustrate how we each have our own musical preferences. I agree with some things that people have written, and disagree with others. For what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s my take, in rough order of favorites: Beatles - Anyone who follows me on Quora knows this was going to be my first love. The Beatles are my favorite for so many reasons. First and foremost, they changed pop/rock music more significantly than any other band. They changed the way music was written, performed and recorded, and those innovations are still clearly present in today\u2019s music. In the course of eight years (their recording life) they went from \u201cLove Me Do\u201d to their work on Abbey Road, with unbelievable stops along the way. Simply the most influential band of all time.Rolling Stones - While it can be argued that without The Beatles, the Stones (at least in their current form) wouldn\u2019t exist, The Stones were basically the mold for rock bands that followed them, and even up to this day. Jagger is arguably the finest front man in rock history, and with Charlie Watts and Keith Richards shoveling the coal, they\u2019ve managed to blend blues, rock, country, baroque, and God knows what else, into their act. And they\u2019re still doing it.Led Zeppelin - Don\u2019t feel they\u2019re as influential as the first two, but Zep owned the 70\u2019s (although Keith Richards would dispute that, and with good reason). What they did own was the heavy metal blues genre. Besides, I saw them in \u201977 in the Kingdome, and that experience alone has spawned dozens of jealous comments from youngsters in later generations who missed out. Sorry kids, I didn\u2019t keep my tee shirt from that show\u2026Pink Floyd - Another over-the-top innovative band. Oddly, \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d isn\u2019t my favorite (I reserve \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d for that spot, probably because is was the first Floyd album I ever heard). And can you imagine the unbridled ecstasy that the boys at EMI Studios (Abbey Road Studios) must have felt? Their house band in the \u201860\u2019s was The Beatles. And then their house band in the \u201870\u2019s was Pink Floyd. Hell, both bands used some of the same props for sound effects. Not bad.The Doors - Morrison\u2019s poetry places them firmly on this list. I listen to The Doors infrequently, probably when I feel like freaking myself out just a touch. For what it\u2019s worth, I have a minor personal connection to Morrison as well. My Dad\u2019s executive officer from WWII ended up being close friends with Morrison\u2019s father, so I have family friends who knew Jim when he was a young teen. And yeah, he was every bit as off-center then as he was later. Great artists are like that.Queen - For me, in measured doses, to be sure. Not that they weren\u2019t a great talent, but I can only listen to operatic rock for so long. \u201cBohemian Rhapsody?\u201d Once every four or five years is enough for me (like that\u2019s gonna happen). \u201cFat Bottomed Girls?\u201d Once every decade is way too much. HOWEVER, I saw them in the Seattle Coliseum from the front row, and their opening number was \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d (Freddy rocked that one). So that carries a lot of weight.Sabbath - Sorry kids, could never get into Sabbath or Ozzy. \u201cWar Pigs\u201d bores the hell out of me. But\u2026to each his own. That\u2019s why we have different forms of music.Metallica - Take my Sabbath review and ditto here. But if you like \u2018em, more power to you.There\u2019s one band missing here that, at least on my list I\u2019d put after The Stones but before Zeppelin: The Who - Townsend\u2019s genius could be adapted perfectly by this nuclear bomb of a band. I couldn\u2019t imagine Moonie existing in many other bands quite so nicely, and how Entwistle managed to survive as long as he did within the cacophony of The Who is nothing short of a miracle. Anyway, one can argue that these guys were the forerunners of punk, inventors of the rock opera, and probably singlehandedly kept the guitar and drum manufacturing business afloat during the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. Smash your guitar, Pete!",
