            "answer_text": "You askin' me about money? Labels and Drake? Kid, get me a drink. Now sit down. Listen. Listen good. It's called the music business for a reason. Nobody in The Biz can tell you the whole story. People either want a piece of the action and don't know what they're talking about, or they've got action and do know what's goin' on\u2014then there's Non Disclosure Agreements and contracts up the wazoo - the Legal Eagles be into it like a pack of gypsies onto a big rig jackknifed on the Highway of Dreams and crystal balls all over the joint. Going Down the Crossroads turns into a Highway to Hell.  Drake... Sheesh, what a crap shoot. Listen. You don't go walkin' into music deals unless you're a heavy hitter with a load of artillery on your side. TAKE YOUR TYPICAL TALENT You got talent\u2014that's your product. All dressed up, but where do ya go? You need a Manager, and for distribution you need a Label. If you've got the hype, they pay an advance on your contract. You don't get something for nothing. In a sea of sharks, without a net, you're usually endin' up with a 360 deal. That pays you a whack of money up front. In return, they're gonna take 50% - 100% of the rights to your masters, and grab up to 100% of your publishing rights. You don't get somethin' for nothing. You got the product. They've got the factory and the distribution. Big artists make a lot of money on digital sales and streaming. There's even bigger bucks in touring and merchandising. Then there's paid downloads, CDs; plus film, video, TV licensing, mechanical royalties and et ceteras. Every line's got specialists, movers and shakers that gotta be paid. The label's gonna want 50% of all that too. But, hey! That advance looks good, eh? It's called profit sharing! You make some profit and everybody shares it... DUCKS AND DRAKES Yeah, get me another. Go easy on the rocks. This is actually a good parable, as good as anything in The Book. How it's done when you've caught that train - what goes wrong when the track's blocked, you've no brakes and a full head of steam - a freakin' wreck and nobody's gonna stop it derailing.  Image: Drake See, Aubrey Drake Graham's a good kid, known in Canada for playin' a challenged basketball player on \"Degrassi: The Next Generation.\" He's got dreams and talent. 2006, he surprises everyone and pushes out not a bad mix tape, \"Room for Improvement.\" Picks up a bit of attention from all the free downloads going down. FAME AND MYSPACE Jas Prince, he hears Drake's tape dropped on MySpace. Gets all motivated and introduces Drake to Lil Wayne, who's printin' more dollars than the U.S. Treasury with his record label, Young Money, half owned with Bryan \"Birdman\" Williams\u2014Cash Money. Wayne likes what he hears and does Drake a favour, throws in a guest verse on Drake's \"Ransom,\" testin' the waters. A vibe starts. Hell, it's more of a volcano.  Lil Wayne's manager, Cortez Bryant's building an empire with Wayne and Kanye (Yeah, that Kanye) and the boys. Then comes Drake's mix tape, \"So Far Gone\" with 600,000 downloads. Radioplay goes nuts. Looks like an opportunity for some serious turnover. PAY ATTENTION Jas Prince signs Drake to Aspire Records, which Cortez Bryant has a stake in. Jas then does a deal with Lil Wayne, whereby Young Money/Cash Money will handle distribution and Jas gets 22% of Aspire's profits, and 22% for stewardship of the masters, plus 5% of Drakes' gross income as cream.  Image: Lil Wayne According to the legal wars we'll get to in a moment, that 22% + 5% gross share is worth $11 million. How much money really changed hands? Nobody can say, it's all part of the Non Disclosure in the Settlement. So there's your answer right there. A hundred, hundred and fifty million. Everyone laughs all the way to bank. Drake sells shit-tons of iTunes, millions of CDs, cleans up on tours and licensing and everyone lives happily ever after with swimming pools of gold. You'd think. But life ain't quite that simple. See, Lil Wayne (Young Money) via Birdman's Cash Money, sold the concept of a stable of the World's Best Rappers, including Drake, Kanye, Nicki Minaj and Weezy F to Universal, for a $100 million advance from Universal. Wayne agrees to do a couple of duet albums a year on top of his regular output. Cash Money is supposed to keep a million dollar float in escrow to cover expenses and pay Wayne his profits monthly. Lil Wayne's take on Drake's cream is another 33%. THE PLOT THICKENS There's arguments and disagreements between Bryant, Birdman and Wayne. Wayne says the whole stable are turning out to be thoroughbreds and in 2009, the deal gets restated. Now, everyone's split stays the same but Lil Wayne is supposed to get $10 million for each of his solo releases, and $200K a quarter for Young Money's overheads. Birdman's worth over $160 millon by then. They've all got some clout.  Image: Bryan \"Birdman\" Williams. There's a heap of artists involved who say they didn't get paid, Birdman says they did. Talks deteriorate, tempers get frayed and in 2014, Birdman and Young Thug get busted for shootin' up Lil Wayne's tour bus. Jimmy Winfrey, Young Thug's Tour Manager gets done for reporting the attempted hit to Birdman on the phone and the whole kit and caboodle ends up in indictments, civil suits, counter suits and more shite than shinola. That's the only reason this is a matter of public knowledge. HOW MUCH DOES A LABEL MAKE OFF AN ARTIST? Anywhere between bankruptcy and Black Gold, more filthy lucre than Jed Clampett got in the Beverly Hillbillies. If you need to ask how much, you're not in The Game.  Image: Birdman, Lil Wayne and Drake. So, there you go. That's why you should trust me. Get me another drink, kid. What you gotta do is make some music, grab some of those bright lights for yourself, without arguments, attempted murders and court cases. You gotta share it around, work together with the right talent, make sure everyone gets paid. You gotta find someone who knows the lay of the land, someone who can access the players, knows distribution, knows how to get the songs played and look after your interests. Someone who's got your back. You? Focus on the music. A risin' tide lifts all boats. The world is yours, kid. That's nothing... You shoulda seen The Biz in the old days. Now just sign here, and initial here, here and over there.

            "answer_text": "Usually not as much as they spend on the artist. Record companies go by the philosophy that if they can get a strike rate of 1 out of every X artist to have a top 40 hit then that offsets their misses. I am not sure what the going value of X is, but I'd say that has dropped dramatically in the past decade with their main source of income eroded badly; physical CD sales.Record companies sign an artist / band and usually they control that artist completely except in very rare cases (look up how Led Zeppelin where the first band to have creative control). So EVERY CENT that they use on that artist (I'm talking everything from travel, lunches (most likely the lunch they had that broke the news they'd been signed ends up on their tab), recording sessions, promotion, video clips, food they eat while making the video clips etc etc is A LOAN to the band.  These and any other outstanding expenses are the first thing that is recouped when a song is released. Once that's all paid back the label pay the band their contractual cut and then the label begins to make money. So if the release doesn't hit the charts its money burnt.This is a good example:Neil Bogart founder of Casablanca Record recorded and released the first 3 albums for KISS in an 18 month time frame, and the albums didn't sell. As a last ditched effort he decided to put everything he owned including maxing out all his credit cards into a live album. If this flopped everyone was broke and finished. KISS ALIVE! became a major hit and the rest is Kisstory.One hit for every 10 misses is what they are hoping. ",
