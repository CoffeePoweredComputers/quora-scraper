            "answer_text": "Sennheiser isn\u2019t a brand, it\u2019s a company. They develop a wide range of audio technologies and products. They have a lot of experts in relevant fields who have worked full time for many accumulated lifetimes to improve these technologies and products. Brands like Beats, Urban Ears and Marshall (the headphones and domestic sound appliances, not the professional equipment), House of Marley, and others, are deigner items developed by design offices (Urban Ears and Marshall are both designed in a fancy office in Sweden with not a single audio engineering apparatus in sight) to appeal to specific consumer demographics and marketing campaigns, and the audio aspect of them are handled by asking for the lowest bid from random Chinese manufacturing companies. If you buy Sennheiser, you do so because you\u2019re interested in sound quality. If you buy a designer brand, you do so because you\u2019re interested in conforming to the fashion expectations for the intended demographic. Other scattered examples of actual companies in no particular order are Audio-Technica, Beyer-Dynamic, Grado, Bose, Sony, Stax, and so on. These companies will tend to focus on different aspects in their development efforts - in the high end some will focus more on the audiophile market, some more on the recording industry, some more on communications, and so on. This focus may trickle down into what their consumer equipment is best suited for, but what they all have in common, is that they actually develop the technologies they put in their products, and they all have staff with extensive knowledge about audio reproduction. And here\u2019s the thing. There really isn\u2019t much profit per unit to be made in the modern highly competitive consumer market, if you put high quality components inside the products. That\u2019s ok, if you have a large company making a wide range of products, an extensive professional base of customers to fund development and innovation, and your consumer products generally sell at near full price. But if all you have is your design application software on a computer in your expensive central city office, a marketing campaign involving giving away thousands of units to influencers, some venture capitalists waiting for their promised returns, and a customer base exclusively consisting of low to mid range private consumers, you can\u2019t afford to put technology costing more than a dollar at most inside your $100 rrp pair of headphones. The result is that most of these designer brands will provide you with a sound quality on par with the cardboard box speaker I built myself as a child - at best. If any thought at all has gone into the selection of cheap components, it will usually be to give a much too heavy and boomy bass, because 95% of fashion-conscious consumers will interpret much! more! bass! as better sound. That\u2019s the difference between a company and a brand. And Sennheiser is a company! ",

            "answer_text": "Sennheiser are different because their products are high end at reasonable prices. You get some companies who make headphones and they\u2019ve got this \u201cbrand\u201d that they stick on it and they sell it to the end consumer, and maybe get some rap artist to add their name to it (even though the rap artist themselves probably never uses those headphones!)\u2026 they are in effect selling the brand. Sennheiser however aren\u2019t really interested in the consumer market. Their interest is the business market. In some ways there is more money to be made in selling business to business, however it does come with a cost. You sell one pair of headphones to a consumer with a brand name on it and that consumer doesn\u2019t really know too much about audio quality, all they see is the brand name and go yeah it\u2019s got a nice brand name I\u2019ll buy it. However if you sell mainly business to business - business don\u2019t care about the brand name on the headphones. If you are someone like the BBC and you are buying 1,000 headphones and mics for your reporters to use - which is more important - the fact they have a big logo on them (which your going to have to cover up \u2018cos you\u2019re not allowed to do product placement anyway), or a product that has been professionally made and produces really high end audio even though it doesn\u2019t really have a very big brand presence. Well of course you\u2019re going to buy the high end product with the low end branding \u2018cos you want professional audio quality rather than just run of the mill audio quality and a snazzy brand.
