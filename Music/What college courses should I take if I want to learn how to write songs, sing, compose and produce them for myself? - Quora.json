            "answer_text": "You rare describing several different college programs. First, to learn how to compose, you need to get to the music department and take courses in composition. Now, I\u2019m balancing the comments of John Mayer, who said he learned a lot more about music after he dropped out of his progam, against those of Phil Lesh (bassist, Grateful Dead) who was quite outspoken that his master\u2019s in music theory helped him be creative. A little formal insruction won\u2019t hurt. Second, singing is also a music major, and the best singers in all styles have vocal coaches who keep them voice-healthy and well instructed. As a music major you would declare voice as your \u201cinstrument\u201d, you\u2019d get some class piano which is a helpful tool, and you\u2019d take required theory-composition courses. Third, songwriting requires lyrical ability. There are creative writing courses that might prove helpful, but my observation is that the great lyricists simply read lots and lots of literature and they write constantly. Finally, production. Audio production today is awfully technical and there are certificate or associate\u2019s programs in audio and video production. Your college\u2019s mass communication or mass media department\u2014or possibly theatre department\u2014will have classes in audio production. So the big picture is: be a music major as a vocalist, take elective classes in audio production and creative writing, and if you feel you\u2019ve learned enough, drop out\u2014the bachelor\u2019s degree is not essential, tho\u2019 I note that today even most country stars have a college degree. A BA in your pocket is an asset if you don\u2019t make it as a singer-songwriter. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot vouch for any courses myself. As I am a couple decades out of college and much has changed. You say you want to write songs, sing, compose and produce. People spend entire lives perfecting one of these. It may be better to specialize than spread yourself too thin. I would say that it is not always a great idea to invest in a degree from Full Sail or E\u2019Xpression. Those emphasize the old school model of large studios with massive analog mixers. In which digital audio workstations (DAWs) are treated as tape decks. In the modern era, this is pretty out of touch. For sure, top flight artists record this way. But that is less than 1% of the business out there. I also personally know people that have sunk a bundle of money into that type of study and it got them no closer to getting work as an engineer, producer or artist. You are better off getting a few good books a computer, and some standard software like Cubase, Logic Pro, or Pro Tools. Then just committing to working on something every day. Years ago when I was still using Cakewalk, I did a challenge with myself. Write, record and mix a new song every week. 52 songs a year. That sounds easy, but a lot of people get stuck when making music on computers. It is easy to pick a song to death adjusting every single thing, and trying out all the different effects and variations that can be applied. You learn a lot when you set deadlines and take chances. I really advise specializing in one DAW software. I think it is better to be the master of one tool than be kinda familiar with a dozen. When I switched to Logic Pro I got the Apple Press book and worked through every single chapter. I also joined every online user group I could find. Sometimes the users know more about the software than the company! ",
