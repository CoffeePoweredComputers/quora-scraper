            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to be as unbiased as possible here. Rap: At the height of their abilities, BTS rappers would wipe the floor with NCT 127 rappers. There was a level of rawness in their words that I really loved and appreciated. It wasn\u2019t necessarily about being fast, or hard hitting, just the emotion was definitely there. Now though, in 2020, I think NCT 127 is edging in on them. The amount of time, training, and effort Taeyong and Mark put in improving every single day is really almost unparalleled IMO. Taeyong may have come into the industry as a newbie, but he improves at everything he sets his mind to so rapidly that he\u2019s now the best SM rapper, and MarkYong make NCT 127 have the top 6 or 7 best rapline in the industry. I think if BTS did more rapping like Intro: Persona, Interlude: Shadow, Spring Day, Outro: Tear, Fake Love, I\u2019m Fine, even Mic Drop\u2026 they would still be at or near the top of the game. For now, I think Stray Kids and MX probably beat both groups though! My personal ranking: Suga > RM > Taeyong > Mark > j-hope > Johnny > Jaehyun > JK > YutaDance: Because j-hope and Jimin are standout dancers, people do believe that BTS in general have great dance ability; this isn\u2019t quite true. There are more more talented dancers in NCT 127 than in BTS, and the most talented ones approach or equal both j-hope and jimin\u2019s levels. Winwin trained for years in a very specialised form of dance that doesn\u2019t translate well to kpop dance. So while he probably has the most training out of everyone in both groups, he doesn\u2019t necessarily excel at kpop dance.While both j-hope and Jimin had a lot of experience prior to training, both Taeyong and Yuta (the best and *main* dancers in 127) didn\u2019t have pre-SM training experience. Yuta was a football (or soccer, for Americans) superstar and Taeyong wanted to be a firefighter. Taeyong went from totally hopeless to one of the best dancers in SM Ent (home of THEE Lee Taemin and Kim Jongin, among others) with technique, charisma and creativity that many choreographers have said put him on the same level as professional choreographers. It\u2019s likely he will surpass SM\u2019s best dancers in skill in the next 5 years.Overall, NCT 127 has excellent performance skill which showcases their dance in the best sense. Many don\u2019t know this because his vocals are so incredible, but Haechan entered SM as a dancer (and it shows when you watch him dance, truly). Even the \u201cworst\u201d dancers (Taeil and Doyoung) bodied some of the most difficult KPOP choreos there (Firetruck and, in DY\u2019s case, The 7th Sense) which is self-explanatory.Also, variety is important in dance (IMHO). Their ability to exude and portray different emotions and incorporate different styles when dancing is part of what makes Kai and Taemin such strong dancers. j-hope excels in this somewhat better than Jimin, whose default dance style exudes provocative even when the song doesn\u2019t call for it. Meanwhile, someone like Yuta (and even Taeyong, Haechan and Jaehyun) is capable of doing it all.With all that being said, I think NCT 127 > BTS in terms of their dance ability. My personal ranking: Winwin (for his Chinese traditional dance ability mostly) > j-hope > Taeyong > Jimin > Yuta > Mark > JK > Haechan > Jaehyun > V > Johnny = Jungwoo > Doyoung > Taeil > Suga > Jin > RMVocals: This isn\u2019t even a question. NCT 127\u2019s best vocals are among the best in the industry; they quite simply wipe the floor with BTS vocalists individually and as a whole. This isn\u2019t a question. Most of the vocalists has their own distinct sound in NCT 127, and they all bring something unique to the song. V and Jimin have the most distinct voices in BTS, but neither have the level of skill, technique (and natural talent), or training that\u2019s necessary to best showcase their voices. Not only are NCT 127 vocalists better trained and use better technique when singing, but there\u2019s also enough variety in 127 songs to give them all the time and place to shine. My personal ranking: Taeil > Doyoung = Jaehyun > Haechan > JK > Jungwoo > V > Yuta > Jin > Mark = Johnny = Taeyong = WinWin = JiminPerformance: This is harder to judge because for the past 2 or so years, BigHit has been putting their budget and industry pull to full use to give BTS very grand stages with lots of BG dancers, pyrotechnics, props, and long sets. NCT 127 in only ~4 years old and aren\u2019t the most popular BG in the world, so they get a pretty standard set. I mean, NCT 2018 Black on Black was literally just the members, not even background dancers. And yet, their stage presence is unmatched. NCT are a performance group in the end (despite what one might think considering the skill of their vocalists) and that\u2019s shown in how they can captivate a crowd even with a bare minimum stage and no BG dancers or fireworks. Taeyong alone, on a stage with just a mic and his body, can captivate 15,000 people, and this can really be said for most of the members. Therefore, NCT 127 > BTS. I highly recommend that everyone reading this goes to watch their Black on Black stages, the Kick It music show stages (ESPECIALLY THE PRELUDE) and even WayV\u2019s MAMA 2019 stage. Impact (I saw someone else do this so I\u2019ll do so as well!): In terms of bringing worldwide awareness to KPOP and increasing the strength (?? idk if this is the right word LOL) of the hallyu wave as a whole outside of just Asia, BTS without question. I don\u2019t think they paved the way, but I certainly think they took the opportunities provided by those who came before and blew the door off its hinges! They are also leading the industry in many ways, mostly \u201cquantitative achievements\u201d (1st kpop group to do xyz, highest physical sales for a kpop group, daesang all-kill (which ofc only exists in kpop), fastest group to get 3 albums to #1 on BB200, etc). In terms of leading the industry into a new wave, I think NCT has to take the cake. There\u2019s a reason SM will always be an industry giant.. and that\u2019s because the company spearheads innovation in every area of KPOP. NCT 127 is no different. They\u2019re the most experimental group in KPOP in terms of their concept and their music. They basically created (or at the veery least popularized) the current wave of \u201cnoise\u201d music in KPOP. Groups like Itzy and Stray Kids that are heavily dabbling in this type of music have taken their blueprint from NCT. Even in BTS\u2019 latest album, the song and UGH(\u2018!\u2019??) are very noisy (granted, I haven\u2019t listened to most of the songs, but from what I\u2019ve heard of UGH it sounds like something NCT 127 would produce) and not so much what someone might expect from BTS (given the farthest they go is usually a heavy autotune type sound, with the exception being maybe the Steve Aoki Mic Drop remix which is STILL not on the same level as most 127 title tracks). And well, we know that BigHit (or rather, Bang PD) isn\u2019t the most creative person though he is very shrewd, and has openly admitted to copying other companies models (and this can be seen in 2019 with the huge expansion BH underwent in a very similar way to SM\u2019s model). In conclusion, I\u2019d say that BTS has impact in a very quantitative sense, while NCT 127 had made musical impact that will likely continue to resonate with 4th generation KPOP.",

            "answer_text": "Let us talk about musical and performance criteria which is the most important part here, not bullshit like visuals and number of dancers. Music Quality- BTS>NCT in my opinion but this particular criteria can vary from person to person. This is based purely on your taste. But if you consider critical acclaim, BTS is definitely higher.Performance- BTS>NCT. Stage presence of BTS is unparalleled. They are also very creative in their performances. Eg: MMA performance, MAMA performance. Whereas NCT on the other hand has good performances, but not very eye catching to someone who's seeing them for the first time (through experience). They have good dancers, for sure. They just do every performance the same way, and except Taeyong and Mark noone has really stood out to me.Choreography- BTS>NCT . A lot of people confuse good choreography with difficult choreography. A good choreography can be easy and still be just as impactful. It has to draw the viewer in. And BTS has it's fair share of difficult choreographies anyway.Participation in music- BTS>NCT This is an extremely important criteria for a musician in my opinion. And a lot of critics and GP alike are going to judge you as a musician based on how much you participate behind the scenes. All members of BTS have contributed to production and lyrics in some way or the other all throughout their career. Most notably RM, Suga and J-Hope.Vocals: BTS>NCT. This was very close. A lot of people are going to come at me for this but listen up, NCT might have some pretty well trained vocalists but do they really make use of this in their songs? I've seen NCT songs are mostly rap or chant inclined. The few times that vocals are used don't really have that much of an impact. BTS has 4 singers, each with extremely different timbres that they make the best use of. All of them are stable (don't come at me with voice crack videos, everyone has them). But atleast they sing live. I'll leave it here.Rap: BTS>NCT. Isn't it obvious? Don't come at BTS rapline.Impact: BTS>>>NCT. Recognition is based on achievements never forget. BTS has a huge fan base because of the fact that their music attracted people. If it was based only on their looks, they wouldn't be worldwide superstars. They've broken barriers for kpop, a lot of people who don't know kpop do know BTS. So many kpop fans start off with BTS. Impact matters, and their influence is far and wide.",
