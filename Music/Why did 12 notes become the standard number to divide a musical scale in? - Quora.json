            "answer_text": "Before we can talk about this, we have to get the words right. Scales are built of tones, not \u201cnotes.\u201d People sang Scales and tones for thousands of years before anyone invented notes, which are symbols which enable us to write down the tones so we can remember and share them. The twelve tones are an octave of a 7-tone major scale with 5 more tones added in between some of the tones. The 7 tones are not equally far apart in pitch (the up-or-down quality of music tones) - but adding the others makes it so close, that around 1700 someone devised an \u201cequal tuning\u201d (or \u201cequal temperament\u201d) which made it possible to play scales in any key on the same keyboard and they would sound pretty good. This pretty well fixed the keyboard forever at having octaves of 7 white keys and 5 black ones, whose tones are all equally far apart, if you play every single one \u201cchromatically.\u201d Pianos are pretty well fixed this way - but the top-flight guitarists tune their instruments to what sounds best for them; and their tunings are just a little different from what you hear on a piano. Really! You can look up their personal tunings on the Internet. There are other scales whose tones do not fall on \u201cthe twelve\u201d, or \u201cthe seven.\u201d Jazz and blues, played on piano, fake the effect of these \u201cblue notes\u201d (typically a third - such as E in the key of C, by alternating between the E and the E flat. When playing in a minor key, musicians often use a major scale for the last for notes going up, but the minor going down. Violinists often \u201csharp\u201d the seventh tone, the \u201cleading tone\u201d, so it will mate up with the key-tone (the eighth, or octave) nicely. They do not care if the pianist cannot do that! They are happy that they still have the freedom to do it. The origins of scales are very ancient. The Greeks had several different seven-tone scales, which you can find in any music theory book today; each is chosen for its emotional effect, just as we might choose minor for a melancholy tune, or major for a happy one. Plato (about 300 BC) was against major scales, saying they made the people too manic! And he would also have outlawed the darker minor-type scales, saying they made people depressed, not suitable in his Republic. Folk music such as Irish or Appalachian, or Chinese, often use a 5-tone \u201cpentatonic\u201d scale, which you can get by playing C D F G A, or the five black keys, of a piano. \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d is a classic example of a pure pentatonic tune. Your question: \u201cWhy?\u201d Hard to answer, because scales developed in many regions over many centuries. But do this: Silently press down a lowish C on a piano (not electric - has to be a real piano). Then whack various keys all over the instrument, while still holding the C down (allowing it to vibrate in sympathy with the other tones). You will hear a few tones being added to the C sound! And now play just C\u2019s, E\u2019s and G\u2019s all over the piano. You will begin to hear a lovely C chord (C, E and G) sounding ON ONE STRING! The strongest extra tone you hear is G. Now if you start with C, then G, then the tone that relates to G, which is D, and keep going, you get F, C, G, D, A and E as having strong tonal relation to each other. If you rearrange them you get C D E F G A, or the first six tones (musicians call this a \u201chexachord\u201d) of a major scale. It is the most powerfully tonal arrangement around (in fact, no one really knows why people use minor scales at all, except to intentionally tweak their own emotions). ",

            "answer_text": "The 12ET temperament should be dominant in music while main music instruments produce tones with harmonic structure. it is happened that it possess by set of useful properties which is far better what provide other scales. -Music instruments which used in other systems much more complex and expensive. Their mastering is difficult. -The pitches by 12ET have values which are near values by Pythagorean tuning (PT). Therefore 12ET inherited from PT the good matches with many musical intervals including most important fourth and fifth. The explanation is that by PT from first 9 most strong harmonic only 5th and 7th don't coincide with scale. Another ones coincide as multiples of numbers 2 and 3. Therefore 12ET provides in whole better matches of its intervals as microtonal scales up to 53ET, in which it is tried to obtain better coincidences by increasing number of octave parts. Besides fifth harmonic rather good coincide with scale by PT and by 12 ET even better. -12ET permits to build beginning from any its note diatonic scale which have sequence of 4 notes with tone interval, sequence of 3 notes with tone interval and 2 separate semitone intervals semitone intervals between them. In this structure : If the first note of second sequence is sharped then same structure would be formed with begin on 7 semitones higher, if last note of second sequence is then same structure would be formed with begin on 7 semitones below. As 7 semitones interval corresponds ratios 3/2 or 2/3 then it provides smooth transfer to new tonic note, what is used by modulation and most used chord progressions. Microtonal ET scales don't possess this important property. It is possible to show that number of intervals for it must be multiple of 4. But in all other such variants (for example 8,16.20...) ratios corresponding fifth interval aren't obtained. ",
