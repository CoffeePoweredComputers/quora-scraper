            "answer_text": "Our voice doesn\u2019t sound deeper to us than it actually is. It sounds darker in timbre than it actually is, because it\u2019s reverberating inside our head, but if we really heard our voice as sounding at a lower pitch than its true pitch, then obviously people wouldn\u2019t be able to sing in tune at all without learning to transpose their own singing to the correct pitch\u2014and since, in real life, we don\u2019t have to do that, that\u2019s why people are able to sing in tune relatively easy. Unless they\u2019re totally tone deaf. ",

            "answer_text": "You can dig a horizontal tunnel progressively deeper into a hillside. Going deeper into an ocean, however, implies a vertical descent. Deeper does not always mean lower either in altitude or in pitch. A deeper sound is a richer sound. It is not thin or weak. It has greater harmonic content. Our voices are like that to us because we experience resonances within the bones of our own head that are not transmitted through the air to other people or to a microphone. ",
