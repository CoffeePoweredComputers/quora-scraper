            "answer_text": "Well this question actually matches my mentality. Must say that till xate none of Indians have been able to reach that profession. To be honest it is actually hard for Indians because in Kpop culture there are some strict rules which are required to be followed amd moreover it actually goes against our wishes. Just like \u2026if you manage to be selected through an audition.the moment you become a trainee you have to follow their rules..the management would check your cellphones, they wont allow you to cause any kind of dating trouble\u2026*No relationships like boyfriendor girlfriend*\u2026.strict diet rules.going through tough practices and disobeying their rules does follow severe punishments. Now if you find your self potential enough to not only crack the audition but also to follow such rules then i dont think there's any harm giving a try to it. In my personal opinion i do have such a dream but yes its mandatory..that your determination should be strong cause nothing is going to be easy if you get into it..especially being self dependent\u2026Mostly your reason to be a Kpop idol should not only be a minor one like meeting your oppas and kinda impressing them\u2026.\u201dNO\u201d that wont work. If you have a strong determination you can go for it since talent matters. ",

And if you\u2019re willing to be fully committed to suffer as a trainee until they decide your debut date. After your debut, it\u2019ll get a little easier. Some companies are harsh on their trainees and as a result, they leave the company to transfer to another. Or they just give up altogether. You have to have a strong willpower if you want to become a global superstar. And if you still decide to do it, then pursue your dream. No one\u2019s stopping you. ",

The north east Indians I'm friends with are 160\u2013163cm height and that's nothing compared to the idols that you see in boy groups where they are 170\u2013190cm. And for girls it's even worse so forget it. You may have a chance to become a jpop idol, because they are Shorter than Koreans but jpop isn't as popular as it used to be and the music is pretty weird. So in short if your north east Indian you can't be a kpop idol. ",

Not based on looks or anything but what i feel is kpop industry demands perfect visuals singing and dancing +mainly nationality include their neighbouring countries (smtimes usa or canada too). I haven't seen any Indian there. But there is no restrictions in global auditions. If your talent and visual and luck is all together you may be selected. But still for debut it took years. There are chances ofc but very small ",
