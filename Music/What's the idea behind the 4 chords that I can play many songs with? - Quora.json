            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not at all uncommon for a rock, country, or pop song to have four main chords \u2014 or even fewer. Part of this is because it\u2019s pretty easy to remember four chords. And it keeps the song accessible to average people\u2026 too many chords, and well, let\u2019s let Lou Reed take this one: \"One chord is fine. Two chords is pushing it. Three chords and you're into jazz.\" Especially if they\u2019re 7th chords :-) But part of it\u2019s the idea of a chord progression and the timing of music. Lots of popular songs are played in common time, also known as 4/4 time, four beats per measure, and usually like this: STRONG - weak - STRONG - weak as the beat emphasis. You can find other time signatures, but 4/4 dominates popular music. So your rate of chord changes \u2014 your harmonic rhythm \u2014 establishes an effective groove in the song, and it\u2019s typically the case that I\u2019m changing chords on the STRONG beat, thus, two chord changes per measure, to match the four full beats per measure. And creating a chord progression of four chords makes music much more interesting than using just two. However, even in three chord songs, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re following a four chord progression\u2026 just with two chords repeated. That\u2019s not the end of it, though. Within every musical key you have seven major chords. But due to how we hear, due to what we\u2019ve heard in the past (eg, our musical vocabulary), we just like certain chords changing into others, and find other chord to chord changes rather odd. In fact, Dave Carlton did an analysis of the chord changes in 1300 songs, and found some detailed and interesting statistics (I analyzed the chords of 1300 popular songs for patterns. This is what I found.). So you wind up with progressions within a key like I\u2013V\u2013vi\u2013IV \u2026 which represents the first, fifth, sixth, and fourth cord in a key as a progression. There are plenty of other progressions, but this is a particularly popular one. How popular. The Axis of Awesome will demonstrate here:  Of course, there\u2019s more to any popular song than just the chords. But there\u2019s a fundamental thing to that\u2026 if I pick up a guitar and start playing, I\u2019m strumming the chords and keeping the rhythm. I establish a foundation for a song on a single instrument. If I sing along, then we have a melody as well\u2026 and of course, that\u2019s likely to be somewhat different, even when the songs all have the same chord patterns. And you progress from there to find other differences \u2014 some chord changes that are different, different lyrical structures, a solo in one, a bridge in another, etc. And of course, not all those featured were originally in the key of D.. so they\u2019re going to sound a bit different, even on the one guitar, due to the different keys that might be used. So what determines the key? Sometimes its based on the main instrument \u2014 some keys are more difficult to play than others on a guitar. If you\u2019re counting on a diatonic (one-key) instrument like a Harmonica, you need to have one made turned to the right key (you can actually get two keys on a Harmonica by playing cross-harp, and actually four, since there\u2019s a minor and major key that contain the same notes, and more if you want to get aggressive about note bending/overblowing and remember when to do it\u2026 but I digress) . And often, you just like that key. I\u2019ve written songs in one key or another, then played around with transposing, and often got a sound I just liked better. That\u2019s really all there has to be to it. We all have a musical vocabularly, the parts of the language of music that we\u2019ve learned by listening, maybe later by playing. Some things just sound right because they\u2019re familiar. If you hear a slide guitar, you probably think \u201ccountry\u201d, if there are two guitars, a bass, and drums, it just might be a rock song., that kind of thing. Chord progressions are no different. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of these answers are very interesting and imaginative. I wouldn\u2019t take most of them very seriously, especially when they try and explain things in terms of music theory. First thing you should realize is that those chords don\u2019t actually work for a lot of songs, most songs, in fact. Second thing to know, the \u201cFour chords\u201d video is actually a satire. It makes fun of the \u201cIf it works for them it\u2019ll work for me\u201d tendency among songwriters. Those people do copy each other. Note: To add to the humor, those wacky \u201cAxis of Awesome\u201d guys actually squeezed songs in that didn\u2019t really use that chord progression. Comedy, after all, stretches the limits. Third thing: Following they idea of \u201cThing Two\u201d(I feel like Dr. Suess here), at different times, there have been different chord progressions that have been used in this way. Doowop, for instance, used \u201cI-vi-IV(or ii)V\u201d(C-Am-F or Dm-G7) There was a run of about 50 years when every popular song ran through at least part of I-III7-VI7-II7-V7 (C-E7-A7-D7-G7) Reggae, particularly Bob Marley, favored vi-V(Am-G). Not every song, but at least 100 of them And don\u2019t forget, that country music is defined as \u201cThree Chords and the Truth\u201d Fourth thing(and I could go all night). The first time I heard \u201cLet It Be\u201d, I thought \u201cI love this! It sounds like a hymn!\u201d(Even more than \u201cHey, Jude\u201d). Macca knew this, because he stuck the \u201cMother Mary comes to me\u2026\u201d line in. And that\u2019s the whole deal. We like it because it sounds familiar, because it is, or at least is like one of those diatonic major key melodies that we\u2019ve been listening to in one form or another since Isaac Watt began gathering hymns. Fifth thing(I said I could just keep going): It\u2019s familiarity, and not \u201cmusic theory\u201d that make this work for us. Other musical traditions use and reuse melodies that don\u2019t use our scales, intervals, harmonies or meters. If you think there is something basic and universal about those old melodies and harmonies, listen to this Bulgarian women\u2019s ensemble dig into those \u201cdissonant\u201d harmonies. Keep in mind that traditionally, at harvest time, women worked in small groups, singing and harmonizing on songs like this. And the groups tended to choose up based on singing rather than harvesting abilities.  Sixth thing: Just kidding\u2026that all\u2026 ",
