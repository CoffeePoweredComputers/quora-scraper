            "answer_text": "You would need a few different licenses for this. You would need a master license. A master license is a license that gives you the right to use the recorded audio that you want to display alongside your video game. Keep in mind that this has nothing to do with the actual, physical composition. The master covers strictly the Audio. The master license is owned by the original holder of the recorded master of the song. (The actual sound recording.) The master is not necessarily owned by the artist. The master will most likely be owned by the artist's label, or studio that the song was recorded under. You will also need to obtain a sync license. The sync license gives you the right to \u2018sync\u2019 your game along side a musical work. You would need to get in touch with both the owner of the composition (likely the artist or their publishing company.) And also the owner of the master audio. If you plan to sell and distribute this game you would also need to have a mechanical license. A mechanical license gives you the right to reproduction and distribution of a copyrighted work. Harry Fox Agency sells these. If you need them. Keep in mind that there will be fees involved, but they are often negotiated. It all depends on how popular the work is, in what medium it is being used, how long it is being used for, how many copies it will be included on, and other factors. If you can, it may be in your best interest to use a cover of that song. Check out songs on soundcloud as well. Often times people will post their songs with the permission for you to automatically use their tunes. Hope this helps! -Matt ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s tough to do in general. However, there are some musicians whom have allotted their works to the public domain, which can be used royalty free without permission (though crediting the original artist is always a good and respectful idea). Just throwing that out there. As far as getting permission goes, you can ask the publisher and provide decent reasoning as to why you wish to include the music in your game, and usually, they\u2019ll accept, though there will likely be a hoop or two (or more) to jump through contractually. Now, as far as incurring costs go, you may or may not have to spend any money at all, though you should expect to. Just remember to do your research on this because it is very easy to get scammed on this and send far more than necessary. Overall, be careful out there, and good luck with the game! ",
