            "answer_text": "You question caused me to do some research on this issue. It is something I had never considered before. Here is what I found: Both vibrato and tremolo create a sense of motion and rhythm to a musical sound, but differ in how the effect is obtained. Vibrato is a fluctuation in pitch, while tremolo is a fluctuation in amplitude. Actually, the tremolo bar on a guitar is a misnomer in that creates fluctuations in pitch, not amplitude. A vocal tremolo is like a trill, a fluctuation between two tones that are a semi-tone apart. Instrumentally, tremolo can occur with a wider range of intervals. So to answer your question, I would say that singers use both to enrich their sound. Thanks for piquing my curiosity. ",
