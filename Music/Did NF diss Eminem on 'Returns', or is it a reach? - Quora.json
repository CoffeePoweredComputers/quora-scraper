            "answer_text": " Okay, the first question should be why would NF diss Eminem? When he clearly states in one of his tracks (Statement from Therapy Session) that he grew up on Eminem. I flatline, all of your whack rhymes, that's mine Might get away from it, boy, MM LP\u2014I'm the bad guy, last time I have been taking it easy, the game's mine, fame why? I don't care about none of that, I'm just sick of the trash lines I grew up on Eminem, now look where the game's at Lame raps, Hollywood fame acts, I'm sick of the same trash I got no blunt in my mouth but give me a beat, I'ma blaze that This is not the only song where NF mentions Eminem though. He also says something about a Rap God in one of his songs from his Third Album Perception on the track Outro; But, then I figured out the reason they follow me The reason why these fans surrounding me It's not 'cause I'm a \"Rap God\" I don't need you people to bow to me  To understand why many think he dissed Eminem we should go back to 2018 when Eminem dropped his surprise Album Kamikaze which had tracks aimed at almost everyone in the music industry. The first track of Kamikaze titled The Ringer defined exactly what the album was about. But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu) I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing) It is not confirmed but Eminem might have been taking shots at NF as he claimed that NF is a clone of his Recovery Album. NF is an artist who refrains from using profane language in his music while Eminem could have used the F-word he chose that wordplay, why though?\ud83e\udd14 July 2019 NF dropped his Fourth Album titled The Search and there are many theories that NF might have taken shots back at Eminem on the seventh track Returns. This is because the track contains some lines which seem like Disses aimed at Eminem. Although NF doesn\u2019t really name drop anyone the track does contain General Disses, probably to everyone in the Music industry or anyone who doubted his potential. Brought your hammock to hang with me? Grab a hatchet, cut down your tree Like a mannequin that can speak What I have in store is unique I just mop the floors with MCs I can't stop until things are clean As I stated earlier, its just general disses he doesn\u2019t say Eminem in any of the lyrics. Yeah, 'cause they won't retire me, it inspires me to be inspiring When I'm low I feel like I'm spiraling Pushin' forward, look, I can't ignore it There ain't no I in team, but drop the T and A Sometimes, if I'm bein' honest, feels like it's only me Now that's the part that raised eyebrows because if you drop the T and A from the word TEAM you\u2019re actually left with EM, not ME, and Eminem is usually referred to as EM. This seems like its a shot at EM because what NF says next is kind of related to Eminem dissing him. No defeat, notably, better have it right if you're quoting me Write my name on your hit list, it might be the last time you wrote something Eminem\u2019s The Ringer had a lot of shots at many artists and public figures, so it could be considered as a hit list.  Returns wasn\u2019t the only track which \u201ccontained\u201d a few shots to Eminem, we also have the second track in the album; Leave Me Alone and this is what NF said in one of his verses Feel the symptoms, couldn't miss 'em, wrestle with 'em Then I pin and flip 'em, brought some back up No, well, you should get some (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet) Who you dissin'? Mood is switchin', don't come in the kitchen You should listen, cookin' records while my hands are blisterin' So persistent, don't forget this, hold the tension, soul is bendin' No pretendin', open-ended, low percentage, so demented (Leave me alone) Whole consensus, flow tremendous, no apprentice, dope incentive Show intensive, so possessive, tone aggressive, watch your step when I... (Leave me alone) Obviously, NF doesn't state that he is dissing Eminem, but again he might have used the wordplay of the word \u2019em instead of them (Just like how Eminem used an-effing instead of the F word), and another thing; notice that NF says \u201cWho you dissin\u2019?\u201d why would he say that unless there\u2019s someone who actually dissed him. lol\ud83d\ude02 After all this has been said, my answer to your question is - NF DID NOT DISS EMINEM. He said it himself in an interview with iHeartRadio and this is how it went.  Interviewer: When you heard that line (Referring to the \u201can effing line\u201d) what was your perspective, what was your reaction, what was your first thought NF: First of all, there's no way to prove exactly whether it was or wasn't (a diss), you know I think Eminem is one of the most talented clever writers of all time (He respects Em). So I guess there\u2019s no way to prove that and I wouldn't respond to something that I can't prove that didn't happen or I don't know if I would ever respond to that whether it was about me or not. In every interview, I've always talked about how I think Eminem is one of the best writers and rappers of all time. Yeah I don't know man how to feel about it exactly Well, I hope my answer helped, feel free to comment your thoughts. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Not a diss. Very, very far from a diss. Long answer: OK, lyric analysis time, here goes. The most quoted snippet in the whole \u201cit's a diss\u201d argument is: There ain't no I in team, but drop the T and A Sometimes, if I'm bein' honest, feels like it's only me So if remove the t and the a from team and you're left with e and m (Eminem often gets called Em). However, for those who aren't clutching at straws: it's clearly a metaphor showing how lonely he feels. All in all for the most quoted as a diss chunk: Not a diss. The only other line where I can possibly see any potential tenuous link is from this chunk: Not too graphic, but not PG Lots of action in every scene I'm kidnapping all of your dreams Hold 'em hostage and watch 'em scream (Ahh!) Grab a side, I am what I advertise In this case, people are losing it because, and I quote: \u201che said Em instead of them\u201d. Ugh, pretty much every rapper does that, it's just how he talks. Clearly the actual takeaway from the block is how he's comparing himself to a horror movie. ",
