            "answer_text": "Excellent question! You know, I\u2019ve been a musician performing in larger ensembles since high school, but it wasn\u2019t really until I got to college that I even began to understand those goofy looking hand gestures. I honestly had no idea how to read a conductor\u2019s hand movements. But that all changed when a friend of mine who was a field commander at her high school explained it to me, after the zillionth time being yelled at by our band director to look up from my score at him. (Granted, I have problems with the muscles in my eyes, so looking at him while reading my part is impossible, I have to flip-flop between the two, and looking at my instrument to see what my hands are doing, but that\u2019s a story for another day) I was complaining to her that I could follow along just fine without staring at him the whole time, and said I wasn\u2019t even sure what he was doing up there anyways. She laughed and agreed that he can be a bit rough as a conductor, since he refuses to conduct tempo after the first few bars of the score many times. But then she explained to me what he was doing, and why it\u2019s important. Foremost, the conductor sets the tempo and feel of the music. He or she also visualizes the time signature of the piece (4/4 which means four quarter notes per measure, or 3/2 which means three half notes per measure, for instance) using these gestures shown below:  They may look a little strange if you\u2019re not used to them, but once you get accustomed to seeing them, they make a lot more sense. Through those hand gestures, as well, they convey the tempo, by moving their wand/hand faster or slower, and their feel, by moving more fluidly, or more sharply. That gives the distinction between a beautiful, soft flute solo and an edge-of-your-seat series of string hits. In addition to that, often times the conductor will cue different parts of the ensemble, either with his non-conducting hand, or with his facial expressions and eye contact. Pay attention next time you see a conductor doing his job; before that big cymbal crash, he\u2019ll be staring down his percussionist, or when the horns come in with their big fanfare, you\u2019ll see a sweep of the arm in their direction. The height and wideness of the gestures can also determine the dynamics (how loud something is) or the tone of the piece as well; big sweeping hand gestures, up in the air more, call for a really fortissimo (loud) sound, with a little bombast, whereas smaller, lower gestures call for more piano (soft) sounds, much more delicate. I never thought I\u2019d be saying this, after making fun of the way my elementary school music teacher always made those weird swoopy gestures, but conducting is an art. It takes a lot of nuance and talent to conduct well, and you have to be able to read your band or orchestra or choir really well to do so. You\u2019re essentially playing n instrument made up of 20\u2013200 sentient, independent, moving parts. And now I got myself all excited to take Conducting I next semester! ",

            "answer_text": "While waving the baton or the stick (depending on where you were taught its called different things) does help the choir or orchestra THAT ISN\u2019T THE MAIN PART OF CONDUCTING Believe it or not, the band members don\u2019t read his movements in some secret language. It\u2019s all done in rehearsal. So what IS conducting anyways? The piece or work the choir and orchestra preform is practiced many many times before its preformed, and the director/conductor will give pointers. someone\u2019s off by a beat, timing issues between different members, emotions, dynamics, etc etc etc. Because you don\u2019t want to stop a choir or an orchestra while they are working through their piece if there is nothing wrong yet, but you do want to remind them of something (the beat, emotion, dynamic etc) you conduct. It also helps when you have a fermata, or a large pause. For the choir or orchestra to know exactly when to start or stop you look at the conductor. If you are lost as to what beat you\u2019re on you look at the conductor. This is during rehearsal. Usually by performance time it is just to jog people\u2019s memories to smile, to add dynamics here or hear and keep them on beat. In an essence if something goes wrong at any point its the conductors fault HOW does the choir/orchestra understand this language? You have to remember this isn\u2019t the first time the choir or orchestra has seen this movement and usually followed by a correction when stopped by the conductor during rehearsals. They know by this point what they usually lack or need to be reminded of during this part of the piece while preforming. Simply put they\u2019ve heard it before, and they know what to do. Getting into the actual semantics of it, the beat counting and all, there is a form, but it differs from person to person. The main idea is for YOUR choir and YOUR orchestra to understand you. If you cookie cutter paste all the technique you were taught sometimes your choir won\u2019t understand what you want through your gestures. So you experiment with different ways of communicating through body language and hand motions AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. After a while you grow more and more proficient in conversing with your choir or with people in general through these movements and people understand you better. I can\u2019t say you fully throw out the technique you were taught and do whatever, but you do expound and make it your own for much of it. In any case the bottom line is, understanding these motions for musicians come with simply knowing the conductor and lots of rehearsals together. The better the director/conductor, the easier he will be to understand, but it is still taught in rehearsals and in many many corrections to the musicians. Note: If musicians have had formal training they will also know the basic hand gestures, but in the most part it is just through rehearsals. ",
