            "answer_text": "I think that\u2019s a nice sentiment, but ultimately not a sign that you are going to get back together or anything. The song seems to be about Halsey\u2019s inability to really love anyone, so she\u2019s saying \u201cI\u2019m really sorry that my own issues aren\u2019t quite done being dealt with, and it\u2019s made me incapable of fully appreciating you.\u201d My take on this idea is also that she just wasn\u2019t quite in love with this person enough to WANT to deal with her issues\u2014I\u2019ve always felt that even when timing isn\u2019t perfect, you would still at least try to make it work with the \u201cright\u201d person, and not use timing as an excuse. It\u2019s essentially a beautiful rendition of \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d And you won\u2019t ever be able to change someone\u2019s mind about that. If they want to be with you they have to come to that realization on their own, and your time is probably best spent focusing on things you can control. Either way, a great song\u2014one you should definitely soak up when you\u2019re in that mood. But I\u2019ve found that over analyzing gestures like this just ends up with me lying to myself. Ideally, your ex would just send you a text that conveys exactly what they want. And even more ideally, what they want will align with what you want\u2014rather than making you interpret anything. ",
