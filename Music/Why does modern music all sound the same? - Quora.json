            "answer_text": "Pro Drummer here, I've toured all around the world and played for many bands and artists, recorded Abbey Road studios, festivals etc. Basically it comes down to two reasons. The Formula for popular music and Money. Producers and songwriters follow this Formula because it's tried and tested and safe to follow. It's Intro, verse, pre chorus, chorus, verse, pre chorus, chorus, bridge, chorus, outro. Put this together with 4 popular chords and a \u201ctop line\" or melody, and you've got a hit. Reason #2 why everything sounds identical is because popular music today is almost solely made for kids. Most adults don't buy music anymore but man will they buy it for their kids. Since record sales are virtually non existant most money is generated from ticket sales and merch. This is why you have your George Ezras, Ed Sheerans, Dua Lipas, Taylor Swifts, it's all music for kids and record executives know this: that's where the real money is. Streaming has essentially made this far worse, since artists only get paid .0003 per stream on Spotify new artists don't really stand a chance against Shawn mendes or other \u201cmusic for children\u201d artists. If you think about in the 70s and 80s when people actually bought records of their favourite artists like Led Zeppelin or Prince, or Chic etc records costed $5- $12 per which is around $22 in today's money. And millions of people bought these. There was so much money in the music industry that Labels were willing to try anything and explore new routes to satisfy people's ears and make money in the process. Today there is so little money in the music industry that people are terrified of trying new things to the point where music is suffering as a result, and people keep playing it safe to ensure they'll get paid. It's a sad reality that jazz, and other experimental music doesn't sell, and that's why there's less and less of it, because record executives won't put money into something they won't recoup. That's why we keep getting more of the same. The consumer ultimately determines the market, and until there is a new music platform that overtakes Spotify, Apple, Tidal, etc and pays artists fairly, we'll be stuck in this continuous loop. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t but if you think it does: Imitation. If you are a fan of another artist, it is common to imitate them. Young musicians grow up on the music of some artist they admire and copy them. Thus, their music contains many components of their idol. Collaboration. Many new and young artists are not trained musicians so they collaborate with other successful musicians resulting in a sound amalgamation. Much like a married couple looking alike after they have five kids, the kids bridge their common features. For many artists who collaborate, one side or both is usually uninspired and hopes that the other person can recharge or reinvent them. When they collaborate, they are usually on the way down. Ignorance. Many new and young artists are not trained musicians so they write what they know and that is imitation. They only know what they know and that is what they write. Fortune. They see what sells from other artists and they copy that style hoping to achieve the same success. Throughout history, periods of music seems to have a common musical zeitgeist for all the aforementioned reasons and it takes a new artist to break the dry spell and inspire a new generation or the old generation to grow and learn. I recently saw a young artist on SNL and his first song was a collaboration. The second was loaded with lick steals from the forties. Who knows, maybe that will inspire young musicians to discover a new old style. ",
