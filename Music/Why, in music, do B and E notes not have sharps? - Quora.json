            "answer_text": "They totally do! Since you are wondering about this I am assuming you are a piano player. The piano is great because it is so visual - color coded! It is easy to believe that that means all the white keys are naturals (not so) and all the black keys are involving sharps or flats (true). But just like B# and E# are white keys, so are Cb and Fb. And there is more! The visual layout of the piano is awesome, because you can really see how notes relate. Read on for a fun and easy exercise. Each # is a half step up. Each b is a half step down. You just go to the nearest key in the needed direction. So there are 7 letter names for notes: A B C D E F G Each letter can be naturalsharpflatThat means there are 7 naturals7 sharps7 flatsThat makes 21 note names for 12 different sounding notes within an octave! And then there is even more: You could double sharp (written as x, go up two half steps) all of them (7 more note names)You can double flat (written bb, go down two half steps) all them (yet 7more),bringing the total to 35 different note names. And now every single white key can be named using flats or sharps! It is a really good exercise to write out all 35 note names and find them on your instrument. It drives home how notes relate and you are most certainly covering all the bases and learning a lot. Plus, it is a lot of fun to do. Write the names on ping pong balls or paper snippets and pull out at random. Who is fastest? I am enclosing a graph. More info on note names, pitches, keys, and the ultimate shortcut to creating scales. Thanks for the A2A.  ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. Let me try answering this with the help of basic Physics and math. Standard notes : C , C#,D,D#,E,F,F#,G,G#,A,A#,B. We have totally 12 notes. After the B note, it has to go to C again. Assuming that we have a E# and B # note we would have reached the next octave after 14 notes which cannot be the case. For a beginner , this might trigger the next question why 12 notes and why not 14 notes in a octave. Let us take A note on a standard guitar and try to understand this. Open A String , 2nd Fret of the G String , 19th Fret on the D, 17th Fret of high E String all sound similar (octave equivalency ) but not the same. It is because they are the same A note but played in different octave. Open A string is 110HZ (belongs to the 2nd Octave ) , 2nd Fret of G String is 220HZ (3rd Octave) and 19th Fret on D string is 440Hz (4th Octave) and 17th Fret of high E string is 880Hz (5th Octave). Do you already see a pattern in these numbers ? Yes they sound similar because as we move up the octaves amplitude of the wave has not changed but the frequency of the sound has doubled. Hence there is a strong need to denote the subsequent note as A and not with any other notation. Now that in my opinion is the reason why we cannot have a B and E sharp since that will result in a peculiar situation , where 13th note will have double the frequency of first note , will sound similar but will be denoted by a different note name and it will be very difficult for musicians to remember  Reference Fret Vs Frequency file : File:Guitar fret notes and frequency hz.png Cheers, Balaje ",
