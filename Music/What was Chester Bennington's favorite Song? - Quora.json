            "answer_text": "One song that was very special to Chester Bennington was Breaking the Habit. It was written by Mike Shinoda, who wanted to help him get rid of his drug addiction. Chester said in one of his interviews that he had quite a hard time while recording the song. Moments after singing a few lines, he would lose control over his tears. It happened several times before he finally managed to pull himself together and finish singing the song. ",
