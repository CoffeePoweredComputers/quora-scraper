            "answer_text": "Great question. Many people have the mistaken impression of Africa as a group of one people like you might expect to see in a country, It brings to mind superficial tribal dancing and local people forced into demeaning, stereotypical roles. Rest assured: this is absolutely not th\u00e9 African culture . Consider the fact that Africa is a huge continent. To answer this question perhaps lets first have a look at the following definitions of culture, and consider the characteristics of culture that they each draw attention to: \u2018Culture ... is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\u2019 Tyler (British anthropologist) 1870: 1; cited by Avruch 1998: 6 \u2018Culture consists of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behaviour acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievements of human groups, including their embodiment in artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of traditional (i.e. historically derived and selected) ideas and especially their attached values; culture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products of action, on the other, as conditional elements of future action.\u2019 Kroeber & Kluckhohn 1952: 181; cited by Adler 1997: 14 \u2018Culture consists of the derivatives of experience, more or less organized, learned or created by the individuals of a population, including those images or encodements and their interpretations (meanings) transmitted from past generations, from contemporaries, or formed by individuals themselves.\u2019 T.Schwartz 1992; cited by Avruch 1998: 17 \u2018[Culture] is the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from another.\u2019 Hofstede 1994: 5 \u2018... the set of attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people, but different for each individual, communicated from one generation to the next.\u2019 Matsumoto 1996: 16 \u2018Culture is a fuzzy set of basic assumptions and values, orientations to life, beliefs, policies, procedures and behavioural conventions that are shared by a group of people, and that influence (but do not determine) each member\u2019s behaviour and his/her interpretations of the \u2018meaning\u2019 of other people\u2019s behaviour.\u2019 Culture is associated with ethnicity. ... Ethnicity is the term for the culture of people in a given geographic region, including their language, heritage, religion and customs. Ethnic or cultural background is not the same as nationality or place of birth. Your ethnic or cultural background means the group from which you descend and that shares a distinct identity while you could be a member of an ethnic group and not conform to some or all of those cultural practices, the practices of a shared system of learned and shared values, beliefs and rules of conduct that make people behave in a certain way. The observable aspects of culture such as food, clothing, celebrations, religion and language are only part of a person\u2019s cultural heritage. These things make up how you live and what makes you accepted in society If you are a member of the Irish Travelling community you see yourself as having a distinct identity, and people outside the group also see you as having a distinct identity. Broadly speaking people from the same ethnic or cultural background share the same culture which can include history, language and religion. Africa is as rich and diverse in cultures, people as it keeps changing from country to country even within one country in the continent. Africa is a continent within which many cultures and traditions can be found. That's what makes it so mesmerizing and attractive. Its culture centers around the ethnic groups and their family traditions. Art, music, oral literature, all display the religious and social patterns of its cultures There are over 3,000 different ethnic groups speaking more than 2,100 different languages in all of Africa. There are many tribes, ethnic groups and communities in Africa. Some communities have a large population of about millions of people, while some ethnic tribes number a few hundred. Each tribe follows its own culture and tradition. The Afar are tribal people that live in Ethiopian desert lands. They follow their own culture, and are nomads, living solely on their livestock. When you move to the central highland plateau in Ethiopia, you will meet the Amhara people. These people are farmers and have their own language. Their words and letters have had an influence on Arabic and Hebrew languages. The Republic of Ghana is home to the Anglo-Exe people. There are six main ethnic tribes in Ghana, the Akan that includes the Ashanti and Fanti, the Ewe, the Ga-Adangbe, the Mole-Dagbani, the Guan and the Gurma. They practice the drum dancing ritual and have three military units, whose sole aim is to protect their tribal African culture. The Ashanti people of Western Africa in central Ghana focus on spiritual and supernatural powers. Men follow polygamy, which is thought as a symbol of generosity. Major languages spoken are Twi, Fante, Ga, Hausa, Dagbani, Ewe and Nzema. The official language of Ghana is English. Bakongo people are natives of Congo to Angola along the Atlantic coast. These people produce cash crops like cocoa, palm oil, coffee, urena and bananas. There are many small villages that make up the entire tribal community. They are staunch followers of spiritual and ancestral cults. The Bambara form the dominant group of the Mali. The Bambara are farmers that grow crops and raise livestock. The Dogon are farmers famous for their artistic designs in wood carvings and elaborate masks. They wear over 80 varieties of mask in their dances which depends on their celebration. Fulani tribes are also called the Fulfulde or Peul. They are the largest nomadic tribes in the world. Coming to Northeastern Zambia, you will meet the Bemba people. They have strong religious beliefs that focuses on the higher god of Leza. They believe he has magical powers and controls fertility in people. Berber or the Amazigh is one of the oldest tribes of Africa. They are indigenous to north African countries, from the canary Islands, Morocco, Algeria, Tunesia, Libya and mostly followers of Islam. The Akye are people who live in southern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. They believe in the supreme god who takes on different names according to a particular religion. The other tribes of Ivory Coast include the Dan, Akan, Anyi, Aowin, Baule and Senufo. Malawi is called the 'warm heart of Africa', due to the friendly people and warm climate. The ethnic groups of Malawi include Chewa, Nyanja, Yao, Tumbuka, Lomwe, Sena, Tonga, Ngoni, Ngonde, Asian and European. The largest population group is formed by the Chewa people. There are over thiusand languages and dialects spoken in Africa. The most prominent languages spoken include, Arabic, Swahili, and Hausa. You will find several official languages in one country. Many Africans speak Malagasy, English, Spanish, French, Bambara, Sotho, etc. There are four main language families that add to the diversity and unity of character. These four language families are Afro-Asiatic, Niger-Kordofanian, Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan. Africa is a huge continent with many countries and each country with different peoples following unique traditions. Africa is a living encyclopedia for those who wish to learn more about our beautiful planet To be continued ",

            "answer_text": "Africa is home to the first and the oldest human population on earth and they are also the most genetically diverse human population on earth. Africa is home to 3000 indigenous African tribes, 2000 African languages and over 2000 dialects of those African languages. Africa is culturally diverse as well, with 3000 tribes there in Africa there is probably 3000 separate cultures as well. Unfortunately, with Europeans came their cultural influences and their religious beliefs. Notwithstanding, it is hard to place a finger on African cultures because there is not only one African culture. There are actually many natural and indigenous African cultures. ",
