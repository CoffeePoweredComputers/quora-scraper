            "answer_text": "I experienced it this morning and I can\u2019t recall the last time I did; it was so exhilarating I had to look this up to see if I was the only one who like the experience. I had about five solid hours of sleep, and woke up wide awake, alarm was still two hours off, figured I\u2019d just lay on my back and see what happened. Next thing I know, I was on my back, I felt it but I couldn\u2019t move my body, nor could I open my eyes. I heard strange voices, like a small crowd where you can\u2019t make anything out. At first I was scared, trying to peel my eyes open as hard as I could, not being able to move my arms or legs. Suddenly I realized I was either dreaming or at least in bed\u2026I knew about the phenomenon but as I said can\u2019t remember ever experiencing it. Then everything slows down, I regain feeling, but I want to go back. It\u2019s going to be like a dragon I\u2019m going to chase down. Next time I do the wide awake thing in the middle of the night I\u2019m going to recreate the conditions. I\u2019m also a passer-outer. Mostly during blood donations (most have been successful thankfully for the recipients) but my last time was during an eye exam strangely enough. I had a reaction to eye-drops that is apparently rather common. I love the feeling of coming to, that searching for just where the hell I am as my senses kick back in, usually sound first. I often get this rapid flurry of fast dreams I don\u2019t really remember, next thing I know I\u2019m in the room I just was. I don\u2019t even get embarrassed anymore, it\u2019s just something I do. A little off topic but I felt related to SP. Happy half-dreams! ",

            "answer_text": "As far as I am concerned, S.P. gives me the opportunity to explore something greater than consciousness. It crosses the thresholds, into another facet of both mind and new kind of sensory awareness. We are accustomed to our five senses, and have depended upon these senses, to glean that of the world around us. But these five senses, are limited, at best. It would be like asking an artist, to paint the world around he/or she, using only five colors. Sure, the artist could blend those colors, to create more colors. (and that is what we do, with our five senses). But what if you gave that artist unique colors. Multifaceted colors. With More diversity and more profoundness? Of course it would be beyond notable, it would be astounding! (Please note that; Even though our fives senses are \u2018turned off\u2019, during S.P., by no means are we limited!) Which brings me to your inquiry\u2026 You are not weird, to like S.P., To the contrary\u2026 \u2026I find it to be \u2018weird\u2019, that most people, do. ",
