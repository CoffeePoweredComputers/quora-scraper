            "answer_text": "As being a former president of a national composer society, I would answer your question with Nobody or Everybody. And also ask: Have you considered the question? To start at the end, \u201dcomposer\u201d is a rather unproblematic term: someone who designs, plans or otherwise creates music and/or concepts, by using sounds, notes, images, text or just playing. Usually the term \u201dcomposer\u201d is reserved for art music, whereas creators of popular music are called \u201dsong-writers\u201d, \u201dModern\u201d is a more debated term. Intuitively, modern (from lat. modo, right now) could refer to anything happening currently, like the news, or a new style. In a musical context, however, it usually refers to Modernism, a musical style or idiom mainly belonging to the 20th century, emphasizing complex patterns, unusual techniques, high instrumental skills and concentrated listening. Which gets us to \u201dThe Greatest\u201d, which is easiest and hardest to answer, as it involves personal taste and subsequent musical judgement. We all have our favourite music, based on all our earlier musical experiences, advice from friends or foes, educational activites, and personal opinions and beliefs. It could be anyone we happen to like, or everyone (excluding those we dislike). A great \u2013 but also demanding \u2013 thing about living in the postmodern (or post-postmodern (or post-post-postmodern)) society of today is that you are allowed and expected to make up your own mind about what you think is greatness. And although there are people out there who tries to declare artistic canons \u2013 for personal or commercial reasons \u2013 we all understand these are futile, ignoring the most basic fact of 20th century art theory: Beauty is in the eye/ear of the beholder/listener. So, to conclude, the greatest modern composer is a creator of contemporary (another problematic word) and/or complex music, and someone who makes music extremely important to at least one listener.

            "answer_text": "For me all of the best modern composer I know write music for film and theatre, my personal favorite is James Newton Howard,  heck!! I like to call him the great James Newton Howard,  but if I were to pick the the most famous and influential film composer still living and working today, that would have to be john Williams,  John William's music is so well known and influential, he has written some of the most recognizable scores in the history of film music,   even the average Joe can instantly recognize his music, iconic scores such as Star Wars, Jurassic park, jaws, E.T, Harry Potter, Indian Jones etc are all larger than life films,  accompanied by larger than life scores, with a career spanning six decades his style of music spans from the golden age of film music, which is heavily influenced by classical music, in fact john Williams has written quite a few classical piece as well,  he has written numerous concertos and other works for orchestral assemblies and solo instruments. He's also written music for the Olympics, NBC Sunday night football, NBC news and so on. In fact many other composer, Hans zimmer and even James Newton Howard have spoken about his influence on them.
