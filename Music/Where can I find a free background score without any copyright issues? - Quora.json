Be careful when you see \u2018royalty free\u2019. It doesn\u2019t mean totally free, just that you don\u2019t have to make payments whenever it\u2019s shown. You may find some music under Creative Commons search. These are usually material the author has released without expecting payment. Just read any terms carefully so you know what you\u2019re getting and what are your obligations. ",
