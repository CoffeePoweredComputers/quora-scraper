            "answer_text": "I've worked at a few radio stations and have studied music business/copyright so my answer is based from my experience and knowledge - it might not be fully comprehensive or correct for everywhere, but it should set you on the right path! A violation of copyright only occurs when someone does not have the legal right to distribute, share or use media. If you download a song for free (illegally) and you play that on the radio you are seen to be using someone else's product to make your living and is a violation of copyright.  If you purchase a piece of music (image a CD as example, for simplicity) then with that you have bought the right to play that music for personal use, eg. within your home, again it would be illegal to play this on the radio. This is because a CD does not take into account recurring royalties, the amount of times it is played is not recorded.  For commercial use, a commercial license must be purchased. The cost of this license takes into account that the product will be used to benefit your business (which means potentially repeat profits) and it takes into account the fees that must go to the original artist for their work (royalties).  That is the basics of it. My experience was in producing adverts for commercial radio so much of my copyright interaction came from the packages of CDs and digital files that recording studios would send us to use as beds (the music underneath adverts) - this again has been created by an artists and because the company I worked for paid a monthly fee to these recording studios we had a commercial license to use them in the products we were making (adverts) which was the main source of income for the company.  I hope that make sense :) ",

            "answer_text": "This answer is specific to the United States as each country has different laws. The US Congress just passed a major change to this called the Music Modernization Act. Radio Stations are treated differently than all other consumers of music. Most music has three main groups who get paid for music - the composer who wrote the tune, the lyricist who wrote the words, and the performers who played the music and sang the words. Everyone except radio stations (SiriusXM, Pandora, Spotify, jukeboxes, apple Music) have to arrange payments to organizations that own catalogs of songs (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC). Because radio used to be the main way people learned about new music, the radio labels agreed to allow radio stations to not have to pay the performers, as in theory the record companies paid the performers - but many artists got no money at all. The internet has changed all of this. If songs are streamed on the Internet, the artists now are paid by SoundExchange, including money from fees charged to radio stations for streaming their programming. Several artists now refuse to allow their music to be played over the air, believing online venues will drive people to download songs and attend concerts. Big players like iHeart have clout to cut their own deals. ",
