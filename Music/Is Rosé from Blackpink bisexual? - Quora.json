            "answer_text": "There are many rumors to this. Though some people think so due to her relationship with another member in the group called Lisa, I believe that they are just close friends who have trained together for years. But, you never know. Korea is quietly against gay/lesbian relationships, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be saying anything until they leave YG. Also, foreigners may find it so cute to ship them, but I\u2019ve been abroad to Korea. The affection between friends, is really that. They don\u2019t believe that it is anything to do with being gay, its just a normal thing. Don\u2019t take this as me being a gay person hater. I just dont think EVERY SINGLE KPOP IDOL IS LESBIAN/GAY FOR ONE ANOTHER. Of course, its possible to have gay people, but not all of them. ",

Many of these rumors come from the fact she\u2019s touchy with Lisa, another member. South Korea, from what ive heard, isnt open about queer stuff. Ive heard some people say S. Korea is a bit homophobic, and others say they just dont talk openly about their sexuality. Friends in Korea, male and female alike, are very touchy with each other. Another thing, Kpop idols rarely say their sexuality, so its possible you might never really find out. ",
