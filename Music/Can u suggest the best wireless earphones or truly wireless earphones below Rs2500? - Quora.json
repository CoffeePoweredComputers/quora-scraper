            "answer_text": "If you want good overall both sound quality and call quality in your budget range , then i would recommend to go for neckband style as true wireless earbuds don't provide good sound in budget range and call quality won't even be average unless you spend 5000rs. Having said that Best neckband bluetooth earphone option under your price will be OneOneplus bullets wireless zRealme buds wirelessAnd if you want better sound then i would recommend to slightly increase your budget by 500-700rs and get sony xb400 they are absolutely best sounding in 5k rs, but feature wise oneplus have more features. Sadly i haven't found any good true wireless earphones which have all good features unless you spend atleast 4k\u20135k and above as the technology is new and it keeps evolving the price to performance ratio is too low, and this means your earphones will be outdated too soon with new versions arriving every few days in budget range. So i would suggest to go for true wireless only if you don't mind an experience with connection issues and lags in bluetooth range with mediocre sound. ",
