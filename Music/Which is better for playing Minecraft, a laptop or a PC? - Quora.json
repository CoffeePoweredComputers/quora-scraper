            "answer_text": "First off, a Laptop is a PC. PC just means \u201cPersonal Computer\u201d. I believe the term you're trying to compare the laptop with is \u201cDesktop\u201d the term for a computer that is designed to stay in one place, generally on top of a desk. The answer sort of depends on your needs. Desktops offer more power than laptops because desktops are easier to cool given all the space in the case for fans and heatsinks and airflow, meaning a Desktop won't need to hold back the performance of it's parts to keep temps down. Plus, Laptop parts have to be designed to run on as little power as possible to keep power usage low, whereas desktop parts can be designed to guzzle extra power if it means a performance increase, since Laptops are designed with running on battery power as a considerable use-case, whereas a Desktop is designed under the assumption that it'll be plugged into the wall whenever in use. Long story short, the desktop computer will do a vastly better job at playing Minecraft than a laptop. However, the desktop will sit in one place in your house, whereas the Laptop can be used to play Minecraft almost anywhere, provided that the battery has a charge or there's a plug available to plug in the charger. This can make showing up to a LAN party with friends a tad more convenient - with the desktop, you have to carry the computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers/headphones, etcetera separately, whereas the laptop can be practically an \u201call-in-one\u201d device for this sort of thing (bring your own mouse, though. Trackpads are lousy business for playing a game like Minecraft). Plus, you need less space to set up a laptop than a desktop, since the Laptop fits on your lap, while the Desktop does not. If you'll only be playing Minecraft at home, or you'll go to LAN with your friends and the LAN area has enough tables and plugs and all for you to set up your desktop there, feel free to get a desktop for playing Minecraft. If you'll be on the go with Minecraft all the time and you just need that extra portability out of your computer, a laptop can suffice. It's also worth noting that the age of the desktop and laptop matter a lot, too. A laptop from today will almost always beat a desktop from 2003, and may defeat one from 2010, depending on the specs of both. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the version you are playing. If your are playing the java version, which is purchased from Mohjang, then a gaming desktop will typically beat a gaming laptop. However mostly this is draw distance (how far you can see). If you are buying Minecraft from the Microsoft Store, then you'll notice no difference. A \u00a3180 laptop can run this version smoothly! ",
