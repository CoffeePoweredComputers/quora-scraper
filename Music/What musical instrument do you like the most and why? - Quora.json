            "answer_text": "Acoustic bass guitars are interesting musical instruments. They were born of double (or upright) basses and guitars and have evolved over time. Fretted or not, the hollow-bodied instrument is an infant among the species, the first prototypes rolling out in the mid 50\u2019s. And they are still evolving! We recently added a fretted Kala U-Bass, bass ukulele to our studio collection. They are a new breed among the species. It's a wonderful instrument! It solves the problem of having to lug around a full-sized bass, because it was specifically designed with portability in mind; its compact size fits comfortably into the overhead compartment of an airplane.  My husband agreed to be my \u201clovely assistant\u201d and model in these photos for size reference. It weighs a fraction of an acoustic bass and takes up far less room. It is an especially economical space-saving purchase for bass players who live in cramped city apartments. It is also a very quiet practice instrument. You won't find your agitated neighbors pounding on your walls because your volume needs to be turned down. Electronic amplification is almost needed during a jam session. Solo, you're good to roll in an open room.  Size difference with a regular fretted hollow body. The U-Bass has a rich, vibrant tone, and sounds like a traditional steel stringed acoustic bass. The tuning is the same. The fat polymer strings even offer a similar vibrational dynamic to the large core steel ones you play on a double bass. The full body mahogany model we purchased sounds great! They are also available fretless.  Dynamic polymer strings equal fat sound and attack. \u201cRubber strings\u201d Who knew!? Included within the body are Custom Kala electronics with active EQ on board, so you won't need to go searching for a clip-on in order to tune your instrument, and plugging in enhances the experience. I haven't yet played through effects, but I'm sure I'll be slapping out Higher Ground later this afternoon through some cool FX. The U-Bass rocks!  Convenient electronics built in. Uke basses are trending. Professional musicians are ditching their cumbersome basses and gigging with their U-Basses nowadays. They sound that close to the real thing! The only drawback is you lose the ability to use a bow; the polymer strings won't allow for a bow draw. This instrument is more of a pluck and pick, a slap and groover, not a smooth-bow soother.  U-Bass with my upright bass in background. I suppose in studio, if I really need that bowed bass, I'll rely on my 3/4\u2033 upright. Of course, I'll need a roadie to transport that monster to my jams for me. I'm just a tiny little thing. The bass is huge and cumbersome. I much prefer an instrument scaled down to my size whenever possible. The Ukelele Bass did just that. Isn't that interesting?   ",

            "answer_text": "After reading about thirty answers, I am SHOCKED that nobody seems to have brought up the most beautiful, expressive, sexy, emotionally evocative instrument known - the SAXOPHONE! When I was three years old, I was watching television and I heard something that utterly transported me to another, much more pleasurable dimension. I asked my dad \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dad, being a lifelong musician himself explained that \u201cthat\u2019s the saxophone.\u201d I then said \u201cTHAT is what I want to play when I grow up!\u201d From that point on, my passion never left me. (Coincidentally, it was also the first time in my life I\u2019d ever seen a Black person. My dad explained that it was just a person with a different skin color from mine. This fact will make sense later.) I had to wait another 11 years until I could actually start playing one - Junior High School Band. In less than a week, I was able to read simple sheet music, play some basic scales, and produce a fairly decent tone, despite the fact that the sax the school had provided was a complete piece of shit (POS.) It was designed poorly to begin with, and it leaked like a sieve. I didn\u2019t care. I just kept blowing and blowing. Soon enough, I got sick and tired of being nagged to practice all the time. Instead of quitting, I just learned how to play by ear, improvise, and play my parts from memory. I NEVER practiced - I always \u201cjust played.\u201d I had a few years of private lessons, and by the time I was in my late teens, I was so sick of the regimentation of marching band, the utter boredom of constantly playing other people\u2019s music (instead of the music in my head and heart) and being fucking surrounded by people who were absolutely certain they knew what was best for me and my playing (despite the fact that not a single ONE of them could play like I could.) I don\u2019t say this to boast. I was born with this. It\u2019s no more worthy of vanity than having Blue eyes or brown hair. It just is what it is. Around that time I began to play Bass Guitar. I was in a small band playing the top 40 hits of the day (Beatles, other British Invasion, American Pop, mostly.) The problem was that every time we were supposed to play a gig, my bandmates pulled the bass out of my hands and gave it to the rhythm guitarist. \u201cBut what am I supposed to play?\u201d \u201cPlay the sax, man.\u201d \u201cBut I haven\u2019t learned any of the parts on saxophone!\u201d \u201cFAKE IT, man!\u201d These days, as a seasoned professional, I consider it downright insulting to refer to this skill as \u201cfaking it,\u201d but at that moment I sure as Hell started playing those songs, based on listening and the talent I was born with. I was considered very good at what I did. But I HATED the flip side - sheet music, endless boring rehearsals for symphonic pieces I detested and again getting nagged about PRACTICING. So I decided to quit playing saxophone! Around this time I had experienced a very profound spiritual awakening to Unconditional Love. I very dearly wanted my music to be an expression of that spirit in me. Not long after saying \u201cI quit,\u201d my grandmother bought me an album she\u2019d found in the cutout bin (remember those?) for (I think) about 69 cents. On the cover was a sweaty, very serious-looking Black man blowing a tenor sax. I told Grandma that I didn\u2019t know who this was, but I\u2019d give it a listen anyway. About 5 minutes into the album, I was weeping tears of joy and thinking \u201cOH! So THAT\u2019S what you can do with a saxophone!\u201d I couldn\u2019t move until the record reached its end, whereupon I put it on again with the record player on infinite repeat (remember that?) The record? You\u2019re wondering who it was on that record? It was John Coltrane, playing his masterpiece, \u201cA Love Supreme.\u201d He had completely changed his style for this album, based on (yup) his recent spiritual awakening to Unconditional Love. That was almost 60 years ago. I subsequently had a very satisfying and somewhat successful career as a saxophonist, specializing in playing by ear and improvising complex tunes on the fly. Often, I was the only sax player who could walk into a substitute job with a band I\u2019d never played with; never rehearsed with and play a four-hour gig leaving the audience commenting on how \u201ctight\u201d we were and \u201cyou guys must have been together for years!\u201d In the recording studio, I could listen to the tracks ONCE and lay down a sax solo that just FIT. Sometimes I used multitracking to play ALL the parts of a full horn section. Thanks, Grandma! ",
