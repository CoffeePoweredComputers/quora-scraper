            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t have royalties, they have residuals. Most movie work is union and they have a daily rate for 8 hours work (but for some reason they have a minimum of a 10 hour work day) with over time after 8 hours and double time after 10 hours. Most sets run 12\u201314 hour days and run them 6 days a week. Exceptions to this are news and live TV which have shifts and some overtime. The cheapest employee in a Los Angeles studio makes $300 to $630 per day. They get nothing else other than heath and retirement. No residuals. They might work 1 day or 150 days on a TV show. The only people who get residuals are ACTORs, WRITERs, DIRECTORs and PRODUCERs. They get a straight salary, Actors can make from $250 to $1,500 per day. Those in regular TV shows are paid a flat salary of $15,000 to $1,000,000 an episode. But Residuals are base on the UNION minimum so they are like $250 a day to $4,500 or so per week. They go down from there by 10% each airing until they finally reach just 10%. then it\u2019s $25 and $450 for each airing. Same with writers. They get between $2,500 for a half hour story to $150,000 for a screenplay at union rates. On a TV show this can be $7,000 a week to $1,000,000 a year. Movies can be $1,000,000+ a year. Directors make $5,000 to $10,000 a day, they\u2019d get the $5,000 minimum for a residual scaled down to 10% after 10 airing. For a TV show they get $35,000 flat and that would be their residual, scaled down to 10%. For a feature the base rate is $200,000 and that would be the residual, scaled down. Some actors and directors might have custom contracts with custom residuals. They might assign those payments to various people, children, grandchildren, wives, ex-wife 1, ex-wife 2, ex-wife 3, we-wife 4. Some actors, directors and writers get \u201cpoints\u201d in the movie. Gross points and net points. Most never see net point and sue then get an \u201cundisclosed\u201d cash settlement. Gross points are based on what the movie does at the box office or at the studio accounting office. When you hear a movie did $1 billion that\u2019s a total take and the movie theaters, distributors, syndicators, get to take a share before it it\u2019s the studio accounting office. So the studio might only see $200,000,000 of that billion. So points are based on either the $1 billion or $200 million. It depends on the contract and what the studio gives. It could be based on the producers share and the producer might only get $20,000,000 and your share is 5% of that or $1,000,000. Producers get negotiated contracts. Some get flat rates. Some owners of projects just get a credit and paid even if they do no work. Some get paid just to put their name on the picture or TV show because it\u2019s an important name. They might get a flat rate of $1,000,000 for the name or get a percentage of the gross. When you see all those \u201cexecutive producers\u201d they are getting the points or ownership as a general rule. Producers get flat rates and maybe points. If they were also writers they get Writer\u2019s residuals. Some producers make $35,000 to $50,000 an episode for 21 episodes. Sometimes flat. Sometimes with points. Sometimes with writer residuals of only $7,000 a week or $12,500 per script scaled down to 10% after 10 years. Creators and developers get a per new episode fee. Writers who create a character that gets used over and over get a fee when that character is used. ",

            "answer_text": "Union regulations (such as those for Screen Actors Guild) specify how much you must be paid initial salary, but I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any guarantee of future income. (Although I can check on that.) There are ways you can get that if you\u2019re a big star, but you have to negotiate for them. For example, Marlon Brando was only paid $250,000 initially for the Godfather \u2014 not bad but a bargain when you consider how much money that film made \u2014 but also got a deal on box-office receipts eventually getting him $2 million. That being said, there are two major kinds of deals, at least, that can be bargained for. that is, two kinds of \u201cpoints\u201d: Percentage of gross income: these are worth gold, if the film does any business at all. But these are tough to get. Percentage of net profits: these are much easier to get but often worthless, depending on studio\u2019s \u201ccreative accounting.\u201d It\u2019s typical for some mega-hit to generate a billion dollars (for example) and then studio accountants figure out how to write off 990 million on \u201cexpenses.\u201d This is done so that all the people who got \u201cpoints\u201d in net profits can be paid very little. TV and the Internet have complicated matters considerably. How much of the income do participants get for all the DVD sales? Rentals? Internet streaming? Again, all these things have to be negotiated for, and in some cases people with points were left high and dry because the technology changed before these things could be put into contracts. This is why people need agents. :) ",
