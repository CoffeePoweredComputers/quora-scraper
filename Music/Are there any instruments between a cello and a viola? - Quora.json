            "answer_text": "There are not any members of the standard modern violin family between the cello and the viola. There are some non-standard ones, both archaic, and experimental. There were 5-string cellos with the fifth string being an \u201cE\u201d a fifth above the open \u201cA\u201d. The Bach Sixth Suite was written for this instrument. Most were eventually cut down to be standard 4-string cellos. There are a few still extant, I'm told, although the few I've played are either restored where possible back to 5-strings, or are of modern make. Some fifty years ago a group calling themselves the Catgut Accoustical Society undertook to make a revamped set of instruments based on the violin. Their basic premise (debatable!) was that the violin had the \u201cperfect sound quality\u201d and that violas, cellos, and double basses were inferior in this area. So they revamped for length, thickness, and tuning, and got a set of instruments that indeed sounded more like lower-pitched violins. The viola especially underwent huge changes, including a small one held under the chin, and a larger one played vertically in the manner of a cello. If I recall correctly, which I may not, there was a smaller cello with an \u201cE\u201d, but no \u201cC\u201d, and a bigger one that I remember nothing about. I apologize doubly: I can't provide links these days, as any attempt crashes Quora on my device, andIt has been about 50 years since I saw and played any of them.I vaguely remember an article in Scientific American, by a member of the society named Carleen Hutchins, about that time.

Neither one of them is common, though. The viola da gamba would probably cover the tonal range. It was commonly used in the 16th and 17th centuries. It looks like it has seven strings, from the photo on this site, although the text mentions other configurations: About the Viol. The other is the violoncello piccolo, which usually has five strings and is sometimes known as the 5-string cello. Although uncommon in modern times, it may still be found. Music for it was composed by members of the Bach family, Vivaldi, Haydn, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, and Britten. Pictures may be seen here: I: J. S. BACH AND THE FIVE STRING CELLO. ",

Sigiswald Kuijken has been reviving the \u201cvioloncello da spalla\u201d, which is a small cello, played, not exactly under your chin, but held up with a strap across your chest.  The ensemble \u201cLes 24 violons de Roi\u201d (the 24 violins of the king) has been commissioning a number of instruments that the composer Lully used, but that also have gone extinct. Start this video at 4:35 to see the 3 instruments that came between the violin and cello. The lowest definitely looks bigger than a viola.  ",

It can be easily played by violinists and despite the appareance it\u2019s very comfortable to play because the belts unload the weight of the instrument on the shoulders. You can play basically all the repertoire of the ordinary cello with it, especially the 6th suite that Bach wrote for . The sound has less resonance but it\u2019s more agile and brilliant than the ordinary cello. Here you can watch a top notch performance (Bach 6th suite) of the instrument played by the virtuoso violinist Sergej Malov  In addition there is the audio of the second suite of Bach too  ",

            "answer_text": "Great answers about violi gambi etc. They came in many sizes and many numbers of strings. Gretted and non-fretted. The reason that the modern string quartet/orchestra has only violini, violi, celli and bassi is that there is quite a bit of overlap between the viola and the cello. All the ranges are covered, most redundantly, for pitch. The Cello could play all the parts. It has the range. The reason for the division of labor is that each instrument has it\u2019s own voice and tone. When the cello is playing in the viola\u2019s range, it sounds like a cello, not a viola. When the viola is playing in the violin\u2019s range, it doesn\u2019t sound like a violin. Cello can really fool you because they are as bright as a violin, and they play in the violin range all the time. They just sound stronger somehow. ",

In the 17th century Stradivarius and others made a tenor violin, tuned an octave below the violin, i.e., exactly between the cello and the viola, but its usefulness was short-lived. There is string ensemble repertory which calls for it but its parts can be played on the cello (and are). ",

An earlier development of the evolution of the violin family of instruments, the instrument is not standard in the modern symphony orchestra. Its tuning, typically G2-D3-A3-E4 - an octave below the traditional violin, places the range between the cello and viola and thus is sometimes confused with the modern baritone violin which has the same tuning on the standard violin body.
