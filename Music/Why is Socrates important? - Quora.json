            "answer_text": "He is not important at all ! It was not about him, it was about how he lived and how he questioned all assumption taking for granted and showed no fear of death . And most importantly he proved to the one who was willing to question , that his knowledge was an obstacle and ignorance of Truth, (the ultimate Good). He did not claim to have knowledge of anything but knew the arrogance of the human mind, he disproved that knowledge if used in the wrong way , makes man into a dangerous \u2018 robot\u2019, because he will behave and live according to the programmed psychological knowledge. Education can only give technical knowledge, a skill you learn in a certain subject. You can be an engineer, an economist , a chemist, doctor or lawyer , etc..And you move along in the ladder - right? always on the basis of previous knowledge. You may add to it - But still the basis is knowledge of that subject. But life is more than technical knowledge . The education system or society does not tell that knowledge does not help in living a sane and conflict free life. Socrates was questioning the so called \u2018psychological knowledge\u2019. He would show how a normal citizen of Athens would be be programmed ,into believe he had to have courage to be a warrior and go fight for the State. That type of conditioning is rarely questioned . If you are brought up as a Russian, American , Filipino, or as Hindu, or as a Christian, Muslim or Jewish . Same goes if you were told that the State or Country is everything , that it is your duty to sacrifice your life for it or something else, which is you are being told from childhood,. Then you end believing that you are a Filipino, an Hindu, a Christian, Jewish or Muslim. Another is from South America, Argentina, so you are being programmed to think that they are different human beings . If you are a Catholic you have been programmed for two thousand years. Right? If you are Jewish or Muslim, see the consequences of this type of Knowledge. Wisdom is to see that, that any form of identification to a belief , the knowledge passed on by the particular Tradition you were born in is the cause of division and insecurity in the world, hence the need to fear other humans who don\u2019t have our same belief( knowledge) and in the name of religion or political ideology , we continue to this day to have violence and legalized murder of the so called infidels, or the enemy. See the danger of this type of ignorance ? Wisdom is to see the difference between knowledge that is technical and functional versus the other where technical knowledge is used to destroy the planet and human species, in the name of a particular ideology or belief.

            "answer_text": "An excellent description of some of the little we have interpreted from Socrates\u2019 original method of thought can be found HERE: Socratic Thought (Formal and logical systems). Depending on the value we have for other philosophers, his work could be evaluated in various ways. But it is generally interpreted as highly valuable. According to the god of the temple, Socrates was the wisest of the Greeks. This was during the Greek Golden Age, when a lot of people possessed some type of wisdom. Socrates raised the standard, and since then we have forgotten what it is to be wise. It was important to raise the standard, but what he apparently didn\u2019t realize is that it wouldn\u2019t always be the Greek Golden Age. We can benefit even by small ideas of wisdom, and part of wisdom is believing that you\u2019re wise. If you ask me, there are sophisticated people these days, but they\u2019re like finding a silver dime in a pile of hay. Wisdom, according to Socrates, is even more rare, and Socrates\u2019 opposition to sophisticates had a double-effect of increasing doubt and also reducing faith in sophistication. If we are to believe Socrates, improving everyone is a good thing, which gives the internal appearance that some people are wise who are not. However, some of these people are not wise anyway. In fact, introducing wisdom seems good, until it turns out that no one has wisdom, and sophisticates are merely pretentious. The effect is to realize ignorance, and destroy illusions of wisdom. It might be easier to begin anywhere, and ironically Socrates helps us there by providing a method of critical investigation. Perhaps he was one of the only bearers of the idea of social equality, an idea he doubtless interpreted from the condition of the Greek State during the Golden Age. He should have been granted privileges. It would be better to remember him as a god or a demon than a philosopher, except that most of those who believe in him want to belittle him in order to feel like philosophers. In this way, ironically Socrates, like many good politicians, ultimately created his own enemy. ",
