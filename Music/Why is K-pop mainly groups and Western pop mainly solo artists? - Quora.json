            "answer_text": "Western used to be filled with groups a while ago. During the 90s to early 2000s boy and girls groups were a very popular thing thanks to mainly the Spice Girls. Groups for this time include, SWJ 3WL Destiny's Child TLC and Cherish. As well and Dainty Cane and the Pussy cat Dolls.  destiny's child (letoya latavia beyonc\u00e9 kelly)  3LW (adrienne bailon kiely) Groups in the Western Hemisphere still exists like Little Mix and Why Don't We. They are popular but most groups nowadays are not in the pop genre and prefer indie or rock.  why don't we (me and my friends used to argue on whether why don't we or bts were better lol) (Zach Herron, Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey, Corbyn Besson, and Jonah Marais. ) In fact, K-pop groups used to be often inspired by pop soloists and groups in the Western Hemisphere.  second generation group: SHINee (onew minho key jonghyun taemin)  newer fourth generation group: TXT tomorrowxtogether (yeojun soobin beomgyu taehyun huening kai) There is a good ratio of groups and solo artist in Korea. It's just that the groups usually dominate the industry nowadays. And it seems as though solo artist in america bring a stronger appeal to Westerners rather than groups. Just cultural possibly temporary differences I am sure once a big american or uk group is created, labels will go back to the craze of american/british groups. But right now kpop groups are dominating. ",

            "answer_text": "It's because of how different K-pop and Western is. In the west there's usually a singer or rapper on stage and backup dancers around them. Whereas in Korea the standards are higher. If your a solo act in Korea, people expect you to be able to sing, dance and rap successfully. And in Korean their are more groups than solo acts because in a group their are more members so your popularity is increased. So\u2026 Companies get more money from groups than from soloists. This is what Kpop companies see, Groups = More Talent. More Talent = More Fame. More Fame = More Money. There are heaps music groups in the west and and heaps of solo acts in K-pop. But a lot of them are over shadowed by more popular groups/artists. ",
