            "answer_text": "Lol all these answer to me are completely WRONG. Saying to practice this that this that this that\u2026 pfft.. to me, you are COMPLETELY over analyzing it, do you not think, singing , naturally you'll learn how to do things and pick things up? And also in turn pick up your own sound with your own style of techniques and feelings And not sound like a generic robot\u2026 sing, sing every day that's all you need to do.. half of these singers who practice set times and set things hardly ever get anywhere musically.. yes they can sing technically but it either lacks emotions etc\u2026 just sing, that's all you need to keep doing , eventually you'll get better as you learn naturally.. don't care what anyone above says I've done this for about 10 years and , without bragging I have a great voice. Just put emotion and passion into everytime you sing, and if something don't sound right try and change it vocally.. you will get there, trust me! Much better then the stress of \u201clearning\u201d through a set routine etc.. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, provided you are practicing correctly. When I say correct practice, I do not mean just singing to a karaoke backing track and focusing on hitting the correct notes in a song, because there are several other things you have to take into account that make one\u2019s singing great, including but not limited to solfeggio and scale exercises for agility and ear training, phrasing, stylistic and expression tools (rasp, huskiness/breathiness, vibrato, scoops, twang, melisma, etc), pronunciation, musicianship (arrangement skills, harmonies, etc), support, dynamics, developing a strong mix and blend of registers to extend your vocal range, and so on and so forth. Just pick any song you like and make it a habit to keep these things in mind all the time when you practice. As time goes on, you will be so accustomed into doing these things that they become second nature, and accordingly you can just focus on giving your best expression when you sing the songs you are familiar with.

Beware though, the technique, or lack thereof, your singing is based on is the one that you'll practice. Your voice will get more used to the way you sing, which can be both good or bad. It might even damage your vocal chords. My advice is to either have a vocal teacher (or guides, whatever floats your boat) teach you techniques that can keep your voice healthy and then practice as much as you can. Don't forget to rest your voice at least a day a week if you practice alot the other days. ",

By vocalizing, you're exercising to hit notes beyond your voice range. Vocalizing everyday especially in the morning coupled with exercise will get you warmed up. Singing will be smoother. Drink plenty of water to keep your vocal chords hydrated. Yes, singing everyday will improve your voice given you're doing it properly. ",

Like everything, great things come from practice. Singing everyday doesn't necessarily mean you will become better. To become better, understand that there is a difference between singing to study and singing for fun. When certain notes you are trying to hit come out wrongly you focus on what you don't know in order to improve. Singing exercises work wonders and loosen your voice. The more you exercise, the easier, the stronger and the more mature your voice becomes. I hope this helps. ",

This is like in sport-you need warm your muscules but should not make them damaged. Usually 3 times of the hard lessons per week with vocal teacher should be enough to keep your vocal ability. But as I told this is individual. You should find your own best regime. Also singers are recommended to be silent 1\u20132 months per year. ",

Once you\u2019ve got that part down, all the rest is just a matter of a little work. Here are several things you need to remember if you want to tune your voice properly to become a great vocalist.
