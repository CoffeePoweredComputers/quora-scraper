            "answer_text": "Well there are many reasons. Im not a fan of JoJo by the way. Let's start from the beginning. She started off in dance mom's a reality TV show that got ALOT of attention. Basically every girl on the show is popular. JoJo in the show of course was known for her bows. When she left the show she decided on making her own career and started her YouTube channel. Her YouTube channel was more faced towards kids as she acted childish and crazy for the kids attention. Soon her channel grew as more and more kids were shown her channel. Her bow and high side ponytail tops off everything as she is very popular for it. When she started growing more kid based companies reached out to her. Soon you could find JoJo's merch EVERYWHERE. Bows, dolls, anything and everything for kids. Her channel soon grew to be super popular and her videos were on trending. As she was growing she also started acting in Nickelodeon shows as a special guest. That made her grow even more. She started winning awards and her career was flying. And still is as her channel to this day is growing rapidly. Let's also not forget all the memes people are making off her, also making her known to an older base. That also helped her get popular as well as many huge YouTubers we're mentioning her in there videos. That's about it but I'm sure if you searched her up you would find much more. To Sum it up she is very well known because off her younger fan base. ",

            "answer_text": "Good Lord. Are asking about the singer or the anime? If it's the singer, well basic tween girls need their dose of untalented \u201cfamous\u201dpeople too. I didnt watch the reality show she appeared on, but I did see a few YouTube videos\u2026. Meeehhhh. Honestly, I have no clue why she is popular. As far as the anime goes\u2026 never seen it. ",
