            "answer_text": "Honestly, if you have to ask that question you are unlikely to be able to understand the answer, but I'll try. The sound of someone's voice is not the only reason for that person to be famous. Crazy, right? But it's true. There are a million people out there with great voices who will never be famous. My brother is one of those people; he's been singing for 30 years and hasn't gotten farther than the Atlantic City boardwalk, despite having a fantastic voice. Dylan is not only famous, but a living legend \u2014 because of the words, man, the words. And I'll tell you, a lot of the time, he sings his own songs better than people with better voices. A while back I wrote an answer in which I noted his song \u201cMississippi\u201d. He originally intended to record it for his album Time Out of Mind, but instead left it off and gave it to Sheryl Crow. Crow recorded a substantially different arrangement of the song \u2014 poppy, upbeat, radio-friendly. It sucked. Utterly, completely sucked. She missed the entire point of the song, captured none of the feeling in it. The lyrics are devastating in their sadness, and she recorded it as a fun, happy romp. She did it a disservice. Dylan would record the song as originally arranged for his album Love and Theft in 2001. His vocal was rough \u2014 very rough. But his version of the song is miles beyond Crow's, even though she has a more aesthetically pleasing voice. The feeling is exactly right in Dylan's version; it's a glorious song. The point I'm making is, it's not all about the voice. I suppose it is if you listen to music strictly for the melody, and the lyrics and feeling of a song don't matter to you. Such people are often also people who don't \u201cget\u201d Dylan. Admittedly, if all that matters to you is the sound coming out of his mouth, he is absolutely not for you. But understand that greatness is not all about the aesthetics. Take Simon and Garfunkel \u2014 Art Garfunkel had the voice of an angel; he opened his mouth and one of the most beautiful sounds imaginable came out. But it's Paul Simon \u2014 the man who wrote the words \u2014 who's the real legend, even though his voice never approached the sheer beauty of Garfunkel's. The bottom line is, when the words matter to you, the voice that's singing them tends to matter less. ",

            "answer_text": "Others have covered some of the same territory I am going to, but it\u2019s something worth reiterating. Bob Dylan is, first and foremost, a magnificent songwriter/storyteller. His voice isn\u2019t a perfect radio-friendly tenor, his guitar playing is relatively rudimentary, his harmonica playing is unspectacular. And all of those things are just fine. Because a meaningful song isn\u2019t about the perfect vocal track or a virtuoso guitar solo. Those can be great things, but they aren\u2019t what makes a song powerful. Dylan\u2019s lyrics, and his delivery of them, make you feel something. There is imagery, there is emotion, there is depth. There is agitation for change, there is a light being shone on problems in this world. That\u2019s not supposed to be comfortable, or comforting. It\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s gritty, it\u2019s difficult to process. And that\u2019s something that Dylan\u2019s voice and playing are well suited to communicating. That\u2019s why he\u2019s famous. These aren\u2019t supposed to be songs you dance to, that you bounce around in the car and sing along to on the radio. These are songs you listen to. Really listen. Back in the \u201850s, Harlan Howard described good country music with a phrase which I believe also encompasses good folk music, very much including Bob Dylan: \u201cthree chords and the truth.\u201d Howard recognized something which a lot of later songwriters have forgotten - that whatever happens lyrically, rhythmically, vocally, instrumentally, melodically, harmonically, should not be happening for its own sake. It should all be in service of the song. And that means that sometimes, you leave out the autotune and the fancy drum riff and the wailing guitar solo and the borrowed bVI chord in the bridge, because they\u2019re not making the song itself better. Dylan knows it. Howard knew it. Sometimes the best songs are just three chords and the truth. ",
