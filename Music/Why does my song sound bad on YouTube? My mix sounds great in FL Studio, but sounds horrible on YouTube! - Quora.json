            "answer_text": "Whenever you upload anything to YouTube, once the file actually arrives there, you will also wait while it is being \u201cprocessed\u201d. If you mixed it wonderfully for an Audio CD format (Maximum level of -0.1dB), you should know that YouTube will add some compression and reduce the peak level. This is done to ensure a consistent experience between different contributors. Similar levels. In my case, songs I\u2019ve uploaded actually sound pretty good. But in my case, I always go for a clear, clean mix, with lots of dynamics. I\u2019ll gently compress tracks like Drums, Bass (but not always), Acoustic Guitars and Vocals, but usually not Electric Guitars. Overdriven Guitars are already compressed by their nature. Also, I\u2019ll \u201chigh pass\u201d every track. If you don\u2019t do that, low frequency content will build up, and create an ugly mess of the low mids and bottom. When that gets over compressed, it\u2019s ugly. The only things present way down low (below ~40Hz) are things like Mic stand rumble, heat or A/C noise, low flying airplanes and other useless junk. High passing your tracks is 100% essential! If you don\u2019t know about high passing, do Google it. Usually, I\u2019ll compress the Master Buss, but also gently. Just a touch to glue things together. Not so much as an effect as merely only a bit of polish. Maybe 2dB at a 2:1 ratio. Barely noticeable. So not \u201cMastered\u201d, but \u201cready to Master\u201d. The good news is, you can update files you upload to YouTube. Try high passing and using less compression, especially on the Master Buss. Yes it will sound a bit \u201cweaker\u201d than your typical mix, but YouTube will \u201cMaster\u201d it for you. (Sort of\u2026) ",

            "answer_text": "You didn't get the kick to sit right in the mix\u2014you got it to sit right in your studio. Maybe your speakers don't put out enough low-end, so you wind up boosting frequencies on your EQ that your speakers can't even reproduce in order to feel the subs. If the audio quality is poor, check to make sure that the file you delivered meets the specifications. If you delivered an MP3 file, for example, it likely has a low bit rate causing it to sound poor on YouTube. Redeliver the track with a higher quality audio file, preferably in an uncompressed format. Go to my Profile and you can find all about YouTube Monetization material there... ",
