            "answer_text": "All of the answers here seem to agree that listening to music is good for you. Some even point to studies that affirm this. The one factor that studies ignore is that it really depends on the music that you\u2019re listening to. The studies that are often referred to mostly involve listening to calming, soothing music so\u2026 of course that\u2019s going to be good for you. On the other hand, try listening to some loud punk rock or gangsta rap. Do you still feel soothed? Music is a stimulus, just like any other sensory phenomena. Some things sound good\u2026 Other things sound awful. The same thing can be said of all of your other senses. Hedonists try to take advantage of great feels, smells, sights, sounds, tastes. All of those sensations are \u201cgood for you\u201d. ",
