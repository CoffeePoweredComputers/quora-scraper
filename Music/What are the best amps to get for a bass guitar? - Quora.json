            "answer_text": "Others have of course already pointed out that there is no \u201cbest amp for bass guitar\u201d; however, there are amps that are more or less suitable for you and your needs as a bass guitarist. Some of the factors you need to consider are: CostSize and Weight: Can you transport it yourself? Do you have space for it?Maintenance requirements (this is particularly an issue with tube amplifiers)The specific music you are playing: an upright double bassist in a bluegrass trio playing a coffee shop will have vastly different requirements than a death metal band playing a large theatre or an outdoor stage.There are many, many excellent bass amplifiers out there. You can safely ignore anyone\u2019s recommendations as to minimum power levels and particular brands. One of the most famous bass amps in the world has only 25\u201330 Watts of power, the Ampeg B-15 Portaflex. The kinds of gigs you play, the venues, the material, and the instrumentation are the things that will dictate how loud you need to be. That being said, it doesn\u2019t hurt to err on the side of caution and use a more powerful amp. One recommendation i can make is to say that you will be able to find a much \u201cbetter\u201d amp for the money on the used market than you will be able to afford new. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cbest\u201d amp. The amp you pick depends on many factors, none of which are specified in your question. Some of those factors include these considerations: Are you playing in your bedroom or in a band?Does your band have a drummer? Is s/he loud?Does your band have multiple guitarists? Do they play clean or distorted?Do you play coffee shops or clubs?Do you like a clean, modern sound, a fat, 70s rock sound, or a Motown sound?Do you plan to record at home?Personally, I\u2019m fond of GK heads and SWR cabs. But they don\u2019t make SWR cabs anymore, so, if I were buying new, I\u2019d probabaly go with Hartke cabs. His is because I like a clean, modern sound (though the dirt circuit on my GK head lets me fake a tube sound, when I need it. My amp puts out 400 Watts when I\u2019m driving two cabs. Currently, I play through a 2x10 and a 1x15. For smaller gigs, I leave the 1x15 at home. That cuts the wattage to 250. If I were only playing in my studio, a 100 watt amp with outs for recording (preferably USB with some speaker emulation) would be fine. Seriously, I could write a short book on this. My general advice is go solid state. Get as close to 400 watts as you can. Drummers are loud and your monitor mix will often suck. Having some extra power can fix both of those situations. ",
