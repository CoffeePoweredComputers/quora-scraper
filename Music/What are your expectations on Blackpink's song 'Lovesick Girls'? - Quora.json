            "answer_text": "Stay Themed and meaningful lyrics  People are probably tired of hearing me say this, lol. In the (whole group) teaser I could hear that some acoustic sounds have been used in the production. It also looks like a really sad song. No choreography in mv  I feel like it would be one of the music videos with a planned out story, I don\u2019t think they will dance in it. It will probably involve more acting. In the teaser they are also running so I think it would be more like a \u2018girl\u2019s night out\u2019 or \u2019young forever\u2019 thing, if you get what I mean\u2026 I don\u2019t even understand myself tbh\u2026 Car driving scene   I just feel it\u2026 I will most likely be wrong though but I feel like there\u2019s going to be a scene where their all in a car just enjoying the moment and laughing happily together like the BTS picture above. I really hope so, it would feel soooooo refreshing to get a scene like that. Sad at the start but gets happier throughout  At the start of the teaser the girls look sad but near the end they are running and are looking more free. Maybe the song will have a really nice build up and we\u2019ll get to see the girls go on an emotional roller coaster throughout the mv. Small moment of silence   I feel like music will suddenly stop playing and everything goes silent and it feels like time just froze... Check the BTS video above to understand what I mean, I\u2019ve put it at the current time (2:48 - 3:00). Their individual teasers made me think this, since it\u2019s mostly silent expect for that high pitch sound and wind. That\u2019s all! I will probably add more later. I hope you enjoyed my answer and feel free to ask me questions about BTS and Blackpink.  -semi- ",

Here are some hints on the new Blackpink single coming out in ~1 week. \u2728 Dissing women-obsessed men. This is not-so obvious as the name \u201eLove Sick Girls\u201d does not seem to be related to creepy womanizers.. \u2728 First, you saw her in a tank, now she\u2019s in a HELICOPTER.. Does this say anymore? ;) \u2728 Jisoo queen might say \u201eBlackpink in your area~!\u201d \u2728 RAPPER JENNIE WILL BE BACK. I REPEAT, WE\u2019LL GET RAPPER JENNIE!!! \u2728 This comes at a cost - there will be a surrounding controversy when it comes to her rap.. \u2728 Military-themed. \u2728 This is going to break records (NO DUH.) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ You guys, we are going to have the best comeback ever. Let\u2019s reach 1 billion in 10 days everyone!! Stan Blackpink~  ",
