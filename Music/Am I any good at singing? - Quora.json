            "answer_text": "I'm not a singing teacher, just a student, and my ear is not as trained as a teacher's would be, but I do have an excellent teacher.  I have a decent ear, I can hear pitch problems and nasalness, and I understand the principles for breath support and resonance.   I listened to you briefly.  I am not a fan.  The music you like is not generally what I like, but I have listened to some music from the Red Hot Chili Peppers before, so I at least have some familiarity with their style.  You have a very nasal voice, your timing and pitch are off, and your voice is not very stable.  Even pronunciation aside, you would have a lot of work ahead of you.  If you want to find out how much better you can get, find a good teacher (local or online), and let them listen to you so they can determine how to help you best. I would change your goal to finding out how good you can become, for your own enjoyment, and train your ears with a teacher.  If you find that you can hear the problems in your voice and know how to fix them and are working toward removing issues and singing in a healthy way, then you can reevaluate the possibility of a career in music - but remember that a career does not have to be on the stage, and there is limited capacity for stage performers.   I'm sure that some people may ding me for being pessimistic, or shooting down dreams, but I am just being realistic.  I should add in a disclaimer that I am very, very picky about vocal quality, not only for myself and those I hear in person, but for anyone who dares to try to make money off of their singing and be a professional when their voice quality isn't where it should be.  That said, I can still listen to groups where a few are good and others are not (i.e. some members may need to be autotuned, you can tell with fan videos of concerts), because it balances out with other entertainment talents, but I can pick out who is great vocally and who is good enough, and who is there for other talents (rap, dance) and not their voice.  Even watching singing competitions, I can still nitpick with the best of them, while still enjoying overall performance. For single artists, pitch should be perfect or nearly so, unless you want to be an autotuned recording-only-shameful-live singer.  I can listen to music where some voices have been slightly autotuned, but not heavily so.  I prefer voices that don't need tuning, and live performances, be it concerts of any size, variety shows, or randomly breaking into song, because that's when you can tell if someone is really that consistently good or not.  I am 41, and have no plans to get into the music business.  I sing for myself, for my kids, and for my parents who like to hear me.  I remember recording myself once long ago and my parents not recognizing it was me.  That seemed sort of unbelievable, especially since there was no background music and the quality was from a little tape recorder, the kind where you press the buttons together and it has a big handle and speaker... anyway.  The joy after singing lessons is that I've even impressed myself with how far I've come. Invest in your voice, for your own joy, to make yourself happy.  If you end up being able to use that voice to make others happy, do that, too.  Money should be a bonus, if you get that good, just have a plan B always, because making it is only for a few, most people will try and have to give up dreams of standing on the stage.  Even with K-pop trainees, some train for years, have to pay back the expense and never debut.  They have to be really, really serious about their dream.  So invest in your training first, and then see. ",

            "answer_text": "I did not click the link. I've still got an answer though. The answer is: it doesn't matter whether anyone thinks you're \"any good\". The whole premise can't lead to helpful advice. If you're not good, then it doesn't help you to know because you already know that you need to get better. If you are good, you should already be getting a career, or fixing whatever's preventing you from doing so. I'm a classical music student and our career paths are usually very, very different, but one principle is the same because it applies to nearly all vocations: if you want it, get good at it. You don't need people's opinion because, fact of the matter is, many people will think you won't have it even when you will. A major problem in the classical world is teachers telling young students they have no voice when in most cases they just need some training for the voice to shine out. I hardly know any singer who hasn't been told that they just don't have what it takes (myself included) - and this includes people who have successful international careers and acclaim.  If you want to have a career in music don't ask people what they think - offer them what you have and if they don't like it, smile politely and move on; learn to develop a thicker skin and develop a deeper sense of self worth. Meanwhile, actually get good - learn your craft. I wouldn't presume to know what it takes to become a successful singer in the non-classical world but having a \"good voice\", from my shallow familiarity, is obviously not a big part of it since most of the music is prerecorded and heavily altered in the production studio. You'll find the way as long as you don't depend on constant external approval - only seek approval from people who you know have your best interest at heart and also believe in you. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey Lola, before I answer the question, I second Jonathan's answer. If you really want to pursue singing, by any means go ahead. Fix all your vocal issues, continue sharing your talents, and strive to become a better singer. Do not aim for validation from others (which to me is the American Idol mentality that unfortunately many people follow) because guess what, you will be highly crushed and disappointed and think that you are untalented when they do not give it to you although in reality they might not know any better. This is your happiness, and you must do your best for your own improvement. Seek for constructive criticism, not validation. With that being said, there are two things in your singing that in my opinion you would need to improve if you want to be a good singer - your pitch / intonation and your diction. From what I heard, quite a number of your notes sound very wobbly and unstable, and some also sound flat relative to the backing tracks you use. At the same time, a number of words are not pronounced or enunciated clearly, affecting your diction and probably even your pitch in the process. Certainly, these two things can be fixed with training, because you seem to have an alright ear and an understanding of the key you are singing in.  I hope that helps. Keep singing and I believe you will get there someday. Remember that at the end of the day you are singing not to obtain validation from others but to express yourself through your voice. Doing the opposite totally misses the point of singing altogether. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Lola. First, yes -- I really did like to hear you sing. In fact, I like to hear almost anyone sing who is generally doing so to explore and learn more about how to do it better! As far as a career in music -- well, you've got a solid benchmark here to start exploring that dream. And I can say that I've known singers who have started at roughly where you're at and made amazing strides in just a couple of years with practice and some coaching -- even as a spare time hobby! Are you ready to look for some coaching or instruction? Do you have any local resources to check out? Singing is just one of those things that is really, really tricky to explain without someone there listening and talking to you about what's happening. And not every approach fits every singer, in fact, there's not always a lot of agreement on methodology. Or, sadly, a credential system for instruction that's universally accepted. I should say that you have to be aware that there are some rather unscrupulous charlatans out there too. But perhaps more common are the well-intentioned, well-trained good singers -- who are not so good at teaching, unfortunately. Be choosey. If you're not sure, maybe you can try some easy online lessons. One of my favourite online (free!) series for its encouraging, engaging and totally playful and low-pressure approach is the You Tube videos by Felicia Ricci.  She calls herself a 'Voice Finder' and her stuff is an excellent place to start to do just that. Her message is mostly,  \"I don't know if this will work for you but try goofing around with it and see if it does\", and they're nice and short and easy to understand.  But look around. Check out some more popular, publicly open singers' online forums to get a sense of what's out there that's really useful. ",

            "answer_text": "The truth is, anyone can learn to sing; but there is a degree of practice in a certain skillset if one wishes to sing well enough for a career.  Your voice has a nice timbre (texture), but you must learn to project in chest, head, falsetto or a mixed register.  That will remove the nasally sound which you hear.  Don't get discouraged, anything worth having takes time to acquire; singing is no different.  You can create a career in music, there is a list of things you need to do first though. Study music theory, this will help you understand the following; why and how you will be singing certain notes, what a key consists of, what rhythm is, what syncopation is, and many more that come with the study of music theory. Next, you need to ear train.  I learned ear training by learning to play scales on guitar and piano.  Once you understand music theory, singing your scales while you play the piano is very easy.  This is actually one of the things you would be paying a vocal coach for, on that subject though.... Find a vocal coach.  They will understand what you need to focus on for your practice sessions.  Piece by piece, a good coach will build upon each block of skill needed for singing well. Finally, learn enough music production to enable recording of yourself.  I use the TC Helicon Voicelive 3 with a Cascade Elroy Vocal Microphone.  The TC will allow you to learn about vocal effects, compression, and EQ.  These are very important in creating a pleasant vocal take.  The Voicelive 3 also has a looper on it.  This means you can hear yourself with proper EQ and effects for immediate monitoring while you sing.  Hearing yourself sing with a vocal monitor is very important for a vocalist, but so is listening to recorded vocals.  You can listen to each vocal take to see what needs improvement, then record another take and repeat the process.  If you follow my steps I provided, within 2 or 3 years you will be ready to sing professionally in clubs.  Treat your singing like a career.  Who stands a better chance of getting a great job in their field, the one who studied and practiced in the field for 3 years or they new intern with no experience? ",
