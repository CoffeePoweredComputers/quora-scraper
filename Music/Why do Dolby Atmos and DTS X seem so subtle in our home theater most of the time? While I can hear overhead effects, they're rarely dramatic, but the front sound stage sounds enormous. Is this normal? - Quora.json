            "answer_text": "Yes, it is. If I may ask, where is the tv screen located? In front of you, correct? So sound should mostly be emanating from the forward direction to match what you\u2019re watching. As a matter of fact, almost all of your sound is coming from the Center Channel (dialogue), and the L/R is reserved mostly for effects and music. Surrounds are subtly active when necessary to create the ambiance of the environment of a particular scene. Occasionally sound mixers will put specific effects like jet engines from rear to front, or vice versa, depending on the onscreen action. Please note that these effects (which is what you\u2019re probably listening for), is used sparingly. The goal of a properly mixed multichannel soundtrack is to enhance the realism of the film, to help tell the story. Surround effects are mostly subtle, but if you were to suddenly \u201cturn off\u201d the Surround channel, you would instantly notice a difference (sound field will collapse and all sounds will be coming from the front). If sound is thrown around the room just for the sake of showing off how many speakers are in room and not help advance the story, then it fails as it distracts you (removes you) from the film. That being said, the best type of films which use Surround effects to the fullest are Sci-Fi, Action, and Adventure movies. Don\u2019t expect much from Dramas and Comedies as these type of films are mostly dialogue driven. With Dolby Atmos, sound is even more dramatic (compared to Dolby 5.1/7.1). The key is proper speaker placement (available at Dolby.com) and to properly calibrate all channels to equal volume either by using a SPL Meter, or the built in calibration tool like Audyssey built in to many processors and receivers. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "There could be many reasons you are not getting the desired effect from your home system. Two of the most common issues are speaker placement and sound pressure level. When films are mixed, the Left and Right speakers can be quite far apart, almost the width of the projection screen, with that, the stereo component, usually music, has a wide field that enables you to hear the difference between the left and right or panned effects. Most home setups have the L/R speakers close to the TV where the spread is lost. Sound bars have an extremely narrow sound field, so they artificially create stereo spread with phasing. Depending on where you are in a living room greatly affects the sound quality. So speaker spread is important. You want the center speaker to be dead center of the TV, that\u2019s where the dialog will be. Surround and overhead speakers are placed on the top, sides and rear of the dubbing stage. The mixers sit with a side speaker slightly in front and another slightly behind. Two on the left, two on the right. And two to four in the rear and overheads depend on room size. The reason they don\u2019t sit directly in the path of is to replicate \u201cambiance\u201d. Another thing to consider is that home surround (I\u2019m referring to the rear set) speakers are usually the cheapest and lack full range. The sub-woofer placement is less critical, but the system should be tuned with an SPL meter to film standard listening levels from the viewing position. For 5.1, 85dB in the front (LCR), 82 in the surrounds and 88 to 91 for the sub-woofer. For Atmos, 82dB all around. These can all be adjusted downward for listening comfort or room acoustics (refer to speaker management or crossovers). There are SPL apps available for smart phones and most home systems can generate \u201cpink noise\u201d that is used for speaker level calibration. ",
