            "answer_text": "During my daily commute to work, I listen to a Sydney radio station although I\u2019m living in Kuala Lumpur now. It keeps me feeling close to the city of my heart. I enjoy all musicals - live shows and movies that revolve around music and musicals. My latest favourites include A Star is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody and The Greatest Showman. I have Nessun Dorma, Hallelujah and Shallow on heavy rotation this month. I\u2019ll probably have a different playlist next month. I tend to be quite emotional and if I\u2019m not careful, a sad love song will push me deeper into nostalgia and regret. So I consciously try to refrain from getting drawn into the emotion. Where I live now, there isn\u2019t a lot of choice of live quality entertainment so sometimes I feel that there is something missing in my life. My work keeps me busy and I try to not worry about what I don\u2019t have and be grateful for what I have in my life, instead. ",

            "answer_text": "Music plays a huge role in my life. I have thousands of physical media (CDs, blu-rays, etc). The home hi-fi is great for listening in audiophile quality. Many of these media are ripped to my smartphone, so that I always have music when I'm on the go. I mainly walk or take public transport, so that mainly means blue tooth headphones. But it can also mean hooking up to the car stereo, or the work PC. Apart from all that, I regularly attend live music performances: concerts, symphonies, local bands. I was also a DJ for eleven years and being paid to bring joy to other people was pretty special. In short, for me there isn't a bad mood that music can't make less challenging, or a good mood that it can't make even better! ",
