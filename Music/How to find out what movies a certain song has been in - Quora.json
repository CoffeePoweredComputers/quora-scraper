            "answer_text": "These are all pretty good answers. In order to find who sampled what, there is the website : Discover Music via Samples, Cover Songs and Remixes | WhoSampled Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know one resource as comprehensive then this that would do a similar job for soundtracks. If I understand well what you wanna do, you want to provide the title of a song and see a list of all film soundtracks it has been used in. Also, http://www.discogs.com AllMusic | Record Reviews, Streaming Songs, Genres & Bands can be good for that because they list all different pressings of a song very exhaustively, so if it has appeared on a soundtrack (because not all movies have their soundtrack commercialized and when they do not all the songs necessarily appear on it) you should see it in the list. Then, Ratings and Reviews for New Movies and TV Shows - IMDb have a soundtrack repertory which is somewhat of a work in progress, so it is possible to find it there. There are also a couple of specialized minor sites. They are not the most nicely organized, but they both have a pretty big database. Songs from movies [SoundtrackCollector - The Movie Soundtrack Database](The Movie Soundtrack Database) On any sites you want to look, if the search engine provided by the site doesn\u2019t suit your needs, it\u2019s a good idea to use some of Google's advanced search functionalities. Like if you want to know what movie the song I Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing. was in, you can type a query like this in google I Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing site:soundtrackcollector.com which will give only hits from that particular website. If you want narrow your search, even more, put the title of the song in quotes \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing\u201d site:soundtrackcollector.com Depending on the popularity of the song you\u2019re looking for, if it has been a single and a minimum successful, the Wikipedia page for that song will most likely cite where it has been used. If it hasn\u2019t been a single but has appeared on a singer or band album, then there\u2019s a big chance, the page for the album will mention it. If you still don\u2019t find you can take a look at The Open Music Encyclopedia They have an extensive list of resources dedicated to music and they also have apps and tools you can use to find information.

            "answer_text": "Okay, so say you don\u2019t know the name of that particular song, try to remember little snippets of the lyrics that are unlikely to be found in other songs. For example, there was once I simply couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember where I\u2019d heard the line \u2018stupid Cupid, stop picking on me\u2019 (yeah, I didn\u2019t know that song back then) so I googled \u2018stupid Cupid, stop picking on me lyrics\u2019 and found the song\u2019s name and artiste in the search results. Now to find what movie I\u2019d heard it in that\u2019s been bugging me. I just Wikipedia\u2019d the song. This method works for famous songs, and it might for the not-so-popular tracks. In Wikipedia, it will be mentioned where the song has been featured in. (films, tv series, etc.) OR You can Wikipedia the movie instead and keep scrolling until you reach the soundtrack section. If the song is in the movie\u2019s soundtrack, it\u2019ll be in the track list, but if it\u2019s just featured in the movie, then there might be a sentence at the end if the \u2018Soundtrack\u2019 section that says: This song has also been featured in the film\u2026. whatever. Hope this helped! :) ",
