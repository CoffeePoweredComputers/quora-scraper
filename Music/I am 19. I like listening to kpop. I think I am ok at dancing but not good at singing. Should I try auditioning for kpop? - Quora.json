            "answer_text": "Basically, you need to understand at least basic or intermediate level Korean to sing most K-pop songs pretty good if you must sing these songs in Korean. One of the most popular K-pop songs was Gangnam Style - also known as \u201cOppan Gangnam Style\u201d - by Psy. On first hearing of this \u201cOppan\u201d song, you hear all of that Korean gibberish, before Psy says in English \u201cGangnam Style\u201d, but if you want to really understand this Korean, you need to know the written Korean transliteration, and also get a basic understanding of the character writing of Korea, called Hungul. Also, it is best to take a taekwondo class or learn some taekwondo lingo from Korea, where the martial art is born. Especially understand the Korean numbers used in taekwondo because sometimes, you will need the number knowledge to count off before a K-pop song totally in Korean. Here is an example of numbers used in Korean\u2026\u2026 Il - (\u201ceel\u201d) - means first Yi - (\u201cyee\u201d) - means second. ",
