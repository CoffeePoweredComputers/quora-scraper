            "answer_text": "What guitar should I play on this song? The one that works best - for you. I own a Les Paul and a Telecaster. Both are great rock and roll guitars. Which one I choose for a given song depends upon the sound I want to have for that song. Fatter and beefier sound? The Les Paul. However, I can get quite a bright sound out of a Les Paul. Brighter and more strident sound? The Tele. However, I can get a quite beefy sound out of a Tele. I adjust the amplifier tone settings to do this. So, either guitar will work if you are willing to tweak the amp to achieve the effect you\u2019re looking for. Oh, and different amps will also give you different character, so that may be a factor in getting the sound you are looking for. And it is the reason most guitar players own more than one amplifier. Choose a guitar, choose an amp. Play around with the settings on the guitar and amp and you will find a great sound. It may take a couple days to dial it in, but it will be worth it. Then take a picture of the amp settings for future reference, along with the guitar\u2019s volume and tone control settings. Yes, learn to use the guitar\u2019s controls for tonal colouring as well! Yeah, not as cut and dried an answer that you thought it might be. ",

            "answer_text": "There really isn\u2019t a right or wrong answer to this question. Both guitars have been a huge part of the rock genre for years. For a single coil guitar, I think the Telecaster may be a little bit more versatile than the Stratocaster. Consider also the first Led Zeppelin album was recorded on a telecaster. Sure, it is true that Page became a Les Paul man later. John 5, of Marilyn Manson fame, often used a telecaster. I am personally more of a Les Paul guy. I like the fact that humbuckers don\u2019t buzz and add noise in high gain situations. However, you can get a telecaster with humbuckers and have the best of both worlds. My main advice would be to try both styles of guitar and see which one speaks to you. If one feels better than the other to you, then that is what you should play. Every guitarist is different. You have to find the equipment you feel most comfortable with and run with it. ",
