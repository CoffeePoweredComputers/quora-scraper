            "answer_text": "This is such an interesting question and what I like about it is the fact that it gives people the freedom to answer in something other than a black and white answer. While Yoko had no part in John\u2019s actual death I do believe that in some ways she does have some part in it though very indirectly. One answer did allude to the fact that Yoko was the decision maker and there was certainly a lack of security. John was somewhat naive to the evils of New York but Yoko was a New Yorker and should have been aware that a lot of bad things do happen there. This is one reason that she was indirectly part of the reason John died. Another interesting theory is the fact that Chapman decided on John as opposed to several other targets he was considering but chose John because he was the easiest to get to. This could go back to the lack of security issue but it also can go to the fact that by 1980 the marriage was kind of a joke and Yoko was having yet another affair, this time with Sam Havadtoy. In 1975 Yoko had asked for a divorce because she wanted to be with a man named Sam Greene but after learning Sam had no interest in marrying her the affair ended and suddenly she wanted John back. At that time John was living in New York with May Pang and they were just getting ready to sign the papers to buy a house outside of the city. John seemed both happy and in Love with May Pang but Yoko asked him to come by because she had found someone to hypnotize John to supposedly help him stop smoking. John didn\u2019t really want to go but ended up giving in to Yoko and after being hypnotized his whole demeanor seemed to change and he ended up staying. Yoko wasn\u2019t really in love with John anymore but how great is it being married to one of the Beatles because it afforded her opportunities she would not have otherwise and also financial security. Anyway had they divorced as planned in 1975 John would not have been in New York city proper and would have been a harder target and may have dropped of Chapman\u2019s radar for that reason. While Yoko had no direct involvement in Johns death there is a cause and affect to everything leading up to John being in the cross-hairs of a lunatic who took his life. The day after John was shot and killed Yoko moved Sam Havadtoy into her home and into her bed and when John was cremated his ashes were placed under the bed. Does this sound like the actions of someone who supposedly loved John so much? ",

            "answer_text": "Is Jackie Kennedy the reason JFK died? Was she not vigilant enough? The question is preposterous and one reason why I question the intelligence of human beings in general. It seems as though (on this forum at least) Yoko is blamed for every perceived negative event that happened to John Lennon and the Beatles. The reality of Yoko as a scapegoat is as disturbing as Shirley Jackson\u2019s short story \u201cThe Lottery.\u201d John Lennon was very much his own person. Yoko was worried about his safety and she wanted him to go to Bermuda for the holidays but, he said \u201cno,\u201d he wanted to stay in NY. This is stated clearly in the documentary \u201cImagine\u201d and conveniently forgotten about here. The simplistic brains of many can\u2019t seem to grasp that this was all meant to be. There are no mistakes. This is what happened and we need to live with it. As an Asian-American who has met Yoko Ono several times and sings Beatles sets at Strawberry Fields, the amount of Yoko hatred directed at me is amazing. Are people that thick to think that just because I\u2019m Asian, I\u2019m a representative of Yoko Ono? ",
