            "answer_text": "Old answer: She is young enough that it\u2019s possible she doesn\u2019t even know, so this question cannot be answered. New answer: I can\u2019t say one way or another if she\u2019s gay per se, and she may not want to answer the question. However, the pictures and clips she posted on Instagram of her vacation to Hawaii with her friend Drew (and at least two other people who were never shown clearly) pretty obviously showed that she and Drew are a couple, and the string of Bond Girls she posted on her Instagram story after announcing her song for the next Bond movie seemed intended to reinforce the point that she isn\u2019t straight. I strongly suspect she\u2019s lesbian, or at least bi leaning heavily towards women, but I think simply tacitly acknowledging that she\u2019s some degree of queer is all she feels the need to do at the moment. Harry Styles, Selena Gomez, and Lupita Nyong\u2019o have all done the same and I don\u2019t see any of them feeling a need to clarify any time soon either. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone thinks Billie Eilish is gay because of her song \u201c Wish You Were Gay \u201d She made a video that Popbuzz released. She said, \u201cI wrote this song about a guy that really was not interested in me and it made me feel horrible, so the song is called \u2018Wish You Were Gay\u2019,\u201d she said in the video. She then said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s so not meant to be offensive in any way. It doesn\u2019t mean that I wish he was like\u2026 it literally means I wish he was gay so that he didn\u2019t like me for an actual reason, instead of the fact that he didn\u2019t like me. Billie then continues to say that the boy in question did in fact come out as gay. \u201cAnd guess what? He just came out to me like a couple weeks ago. So I wrote the song and made him fuck a dude. I\u2019m fucking proud, bro! Except not really though because I was really into him, like so into him, he\u2019s so hot oh my God, he\u2019s so attractive.\u201d  ",
