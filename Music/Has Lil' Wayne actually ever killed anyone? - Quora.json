Lil Wayne never killed anyone but he did shoot somebody. a few years ago. Lil Wayne was at his place and found a gun. After a huge argument with his mom. He decided to do something about it. He took the gun and pointed it at himself. He shot himself in the chest. He has been rescued since then but every time he talked about that incident he just said: \u201cIt was an accident\u201d. Now he finally told the truth at what had happened. ",
