Minor achievements for individual artists that could not create the bigger picture or have less impact are not included. Based on general observation without bias thing involve, the most popular member is LALISA MANOBAN. There are many reasons why. First and foremost, many YG fans have waited for the new girl group from YG entertainment to debut.

The pre-debut dance practice video showed her amazing dancing skills with her blond hair that can really identify her from the rest. Her foreign features as Thai attract people to like her in their various MVs. We cannot deny that because the first impression matters. She shines from the other members. Her rap parts amazed many people as she added swag and badass vibes in the delivery with her dance moves. In live performances, Lisa has outstanding stage presence and charisma as the main dancer.

With the help of Lisa, she improves her dancing skills as she testified in one of their interviews. This makes her the lead dancer. Together with Jisoo, she makes the balance of black and pink in BP.

            "answer_text": "Probably Lisa. Here\u2019s the thing about Blackpink, unlike most groups, each member \u201chas their own style\u201d. I don\u2019 think I remember the source, but I read somewhere on Instagram that YG wants each member to dress in a certain style. Lisa, for instant, her outfits are exotic, and that\u2019s exactly YG\u2019s intention. Aside from that, you should consider their face as another important factor. Now I\u2019m not comparing them or commenting on their appearances. When stanning Blackpink, Blinks usually find their own bias. They find the most appealing face to stan (don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m just generalising what fans usually do). Yet don\u2019t forget about personality. Of course the most hilarious and cute member is more well-liked not only by fans but also by other artists and the netizens. Talents is the last factor, and the vital factor which makes Blackpink one of the most highest-rated girl groups out there. Sometimes, fans stan a member just because of their undeniable talent. So, to answer your question, I\u2019d say the most commonly liked Blackpink member is Lisa. Here\u2019s my personal opinion: Jisoo is the the most mature, the visual, good at singing, even though she is very popular in Korea but she doesn\u2019t seem to have as many International fans (Jisoo is the only member who cannot speak fluent English). Rose has a unique voice, however, she has more people stanning her in countries in Europe or North-South America because fans seem to adore her goddess aura. Jennie is popular in and out of Korea, the group\u2019s rapper and dancer. Jennie sings beautifully, but to be honest, she has a quiet character. Lisa, she is the dancer and rapper, wears exotic clothes, and has an outgoing character. Not to mention the fact that Lisa has tons of Thai fans. Whenever I ask someone which member they like best, most of the time they would say Lisa. (I stan Jisoo) Again, this is 90% based on my observations. I\u2019m a Blink so there\u2019s no reason to aggravate my favorite group\u2019s reputation. Hope this helps. ",
