            "answer_text": " Teenaged Elvis Presley. My opinion is Elvis was a one of a kind, although he was really two of a kind being an identical twin to brother Jesse Garon Presley!  Yes he was good looking, dressed differently from other kids loved singing country music songs such as some by Hank Williams, his mother Gladys was a huge fan of Canadian country artist Hank Snow who came out with his first big smash hit \u2018I'm Movin' On' circa Korean War. Elvis would have heard country songs on the radio, heard his mum singing along with the radio, joined her in singing and develeoped his interest in country music as well as the environment he grew up in in Shakerag, a small black area of Memphis where prostitution, drinking, carousing and fighting went on. He was known to sneak into smoke filled music joints to hear his favourite blues artists, locals \u2018Memphis Slim, and \u2018B.B. King'.  Elvis with his lead female gospel group singer, Cissy Houston, mother of Whitney Houston. These musical influences combined with watching his mother dance would have developed his love for music and movement which he became famously known for, or for him, infamously known for not liking the nickname, \u2018Elvis the Pelvis'. Growing up in a southern environment, his access to musical talent was a precursor to his wanting to as they say \u2018cut a record' for his mother at Memphis Sun Studios, those two songs I believe were \u2018Ole Shep' and \u2018My Hapiness' both country songs.  Elvis of course rose to fame, enlisted and served in the Armed Forces, got more into movies which his manager Col Tom Parker, an illegal Dutch Immigrant had him singing mundane love songs churned out repeatedly throughout the 1960\u2032s. The opportunity to do a TV special, later known as the \u201968 Comeback special shot him into the spotlight again and kicked off a new fresh career of doing what he loved best, singing quality songs.  Elvis with mum and dad, Tupelo, Mississippi. Sadly, Elvis wanted to please everyone, continued his search for who he really was, why was he put here on earth and this coupled with his reliance on medication not necessarily the best medication for his personal health led him into a decline that he did not or could not pull him out of. There were no \u2018intervention programs' and the lack of his hanger-ons pushing him to improve his health led to the biggest shock of all, dying aged 42, only metres away from his eight year old daughter Lisa Marie Presley in his million dollar Graceland Mansion.  Lisa Marie Presley & Elvis. His love of God, Music, Kindness, Hope and inspiration was a legacy not many other artists if any can be named equalled?  Vernon Elvis Presley, Elvis Aaron Presley and Gladys Love Presley. He was once told not to record the inspirational song \u2018In The Ghetto' a scary time in America's history, the mid to late 1960\u2019s when good men such as Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King were gunned down [1968] and race riots were prevalent in American society, an unpopular war in Vietnam. He was told this song might inflame people and lesson his star appeal but he recorded \u2018In The Ghetto' as his contribution to understanding and reasoning in a troubled society during those heady times.  Elvis\u2019 rise to fame. My humble opinion is God gave us all a gift in the man, Elvis Aaron Presley. ",

He was one of the real gamechangers who totally changed what went before and made it something new and more exciting. And I\u2019ve always had that respect without needing to actually listen to his music. But it\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve actually sat down and really paid a lot of attention to his musical input and come to appreciate how timeless a talent he was. His voice is brilliant and he had an incredible onstage presence. He surrounded himself with talented people and produced some of the greatest music of the last 100 years. It\u2019s true that his film work is mainly bollocks and he was terribly mis-managed (and I hate the Jordanaires) but his pre-army stuff is mainly brilliant and he had moments after he returned that show he never stopped having moments of greatness. I\u2019ve been an admirer for a long time but recently I\u2019d say I\u2019ve become a fan. I regularly put on his Sun Studios output and marvel at how great the guy was. ",

I started noticing a lot of black labeled ones with a white dog with his' head tilted, in front of an old Victrola, with the message under himsaying. \"His Masters' Voice.\"Who is this guy? Thru these worn labels I read Elvis Presley & the Jordanaires.Hmmmm. Jailhouse Rock, Love Me Tender, I Got Stung. Even thru all the scratches, his sound, his' power came thru to me.Still trying to figure this out, Elvis Presley? Then a light bulb came on, Oh! I know this guy, I just watched his' movie Kid Galahad and last week Roustabout. That's the guy that makes movies! And from there, When I started making my own money, who do you think I bought first,.... Elvis!Oh! Opinion wise-the Greatest part of Rock-N-Roll and the saddest part. ",

Yeah the guy didn\u2019t write his own songs but he didn\u2019t really cover old songs. He songs were written for him. Anyway, I think at the time he hit the airwaves he was a rare bird. A white man singing black music. Basically he brought into light what everyone else was ignoring. That black musicians(most who wrote their own songs) were the real rock stars. Elvis was an innovator. I think Hollywood ruined him but that shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone. George Harrison met him backstage in Vegas in 1971. They had a short conversation but George told him he should get ride of the flashy costumes and start playing his guitar again. If you notice Elvis didn\u2019t stop wearing the costumes but he did start playing his guitar in his shows. Was he a genius? Probably not. Was he talented? Hell yeah. ",

Most poor white kids wanting to get into the music business were Country music fans. Elvis was different. He wore long hair and flashy clothes. Carried his guitar everywhere in high school. He was really into the Blues music. He also loved Gospel music. I think Country took third place with him. He seemed like a big happy kid even in his 40\u2019s. He or his manager felt in the late 50\u2019s through most of the 60\u2019s that songs were costing too much. The guys who wrote his songs were being told no unless they wrote a cheaper song. The movies sucked also. Elvis started taking drugs that he took in the Army. His manager thought it was time to marry, so he did. Elvis grew tired of plain Vanilla so his manager got the 68 special for him. Elvis let other people tell him what to do. His Mom spoiled him when he was small all the way to adult- hood. There were people around him, but who was going to tell him he needed to quit taking drugs? He was a really good man who would give the shirt off his back to anyone.Lot\u2019s of people received cars, houses and other presents. But nobody knew the private Elvis. When he and Priscilla divorced, he started downhill. He was a womanizer which broke up every relationship he ever had. I feel that he died of a broken heart. He couldn\u2019t live the life he lived anymore. ",

Musically though, he was innovative with a wonderful voice, deeply coated with base.   He moved through style with no difficulty, from full on Rock n Roll one second to deep southern Gospel the next. The way that he is able to express such a wide range of emotion using just the range of his voice is almost totally unique (IMO). His movements too were astounding for the time.  He was considered so outrageous that they insisted that he be filmed only from the waist up. Sadly though, he was mismanaged by one Tom Parker, who signed him up to numerous poor films, some with very dubious scores considering his range.  Thankfully he made a live comeback in 68 which was wonderful, but by that time he was so medicated that he started to go downhill. And yes, in the couple of years before his death he WAS heavy, but if you look at the early days of his Vegas career (71) he is still very very slim, even if he is wearing the suits that all impersonators seem to wear.

            "answer_text": "To me, Elvis was and is definitely one of the greatest singers popular culture has ever seen. Not only that his vocal ability was amazing, but he also possessed great versatility that enabled to sing several genres and styles of music such as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, Gospel, soul, country, pop and blues, a feat that is not necessarily achievable by all good or great singers out there. His tone was also unique while his range was extraordinary - he can go down low like a bass-baritone and sing incredible high notes like a tenor in the next. Most importantly, however, he never stops singing with tons of passion and emotion - his stage presence and charisma, until today, is totally unmatched. Certainly, he was not just another overhyped pop star back in the day, but rather a true born performer. Certainly, he was an icon for his time, and rightfully so - the King of Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll indeed. To conclude this answer, here is one incredible Elvis performance for all readers out there, covering Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s Bridge Over Troubled Water:  ",

            "answer_text": "Americans think of Elvis as a semi god. He had unquestionably a great voice , some really good songs, he was a fairly good dancer and actor. He was charismatic on stage no doubt . His vocal range was untouchable no doubt but at times i prefer Tom Jones as a singer. Of course , some covers Elvis made are amazing, he had a very distinctive voice. Elvis was a white man who could sing like a black man. Elvis was born with the natural ability to sing. At the same time i think Elvis was tortured and taken advantage of . He was very lonely deep down. I believe he had a good heart. I think he died too young. One of Elvis\u2019 fears was whether he would be remembered after he was gone. I don\u2019t believe he was very self confident. He was by nature shy and humble. RIP Elvis ",

            "answer_text": "Elvis was a true rags to riches. He believed in God and worshipped the ground his Mother walk on. He was raised right and carried his manners with him up until his death. He knew he had a talent and was going to pursue it no matter what obsticles he faced, including ridicule, embarrassment by others, and put downs by those that did not know him. I believe he finally realized that Col. Parker was good for him in the beginning and made him who he was to become. But he also felt towards the end that the Col. Parker held him back in so many ways. But being raised to honor his word, he kept his contract as it was with the Col., but I believed that is what slowly brought him, amongst other things to his early grave. I idolized Elvis since I was 9 years old. I am now 59 years old and I still get goose bumps when I watch him in concert videos. The GREATEST entertainer EVER! ",

He was good looking, had a beautiful voice, and moved like a sex-god. The repertoire was raw and blues driven, oozing the promise of illicit sex and his hip movements drove girls wild and adults into apoplexy. If you weren\u2019t around then it\u2019s hard to appreciate just how he changed the world of music from bland crooners to wild, dangerous, sexy Rock and Roll. He was simply the second greatest performer of the 20th century after Sinatra and it was a great shame that his talents were not exploited better thanks to Colonel Parker his manager. ",

Elvis Presley was deservedly a great philanthropist, christian humanitarian, and cultural icon. Priscilla got to read, have a gun, have a horse, dance, karate etc. From Elvis. Many women have more dull lives than her. Most men still mess around on their women if they can. I dont want to be a adulterer even if I was a man. ",
