            "answer_text": "The short answer is that the words of a song count for 50% of a song\u2019s copyright ownership. So the writer(s) of the lyrics get 50% of the royalties. A song is generally considered to be two things: Words and Music. Generally, the writer (or writers) of the Words of a song has a 50% share in the song and the composer (or composers) of the Music of the song has a 50% share. For example, Richard Rodgers (who composed the music) had a 50% share in the song \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d and Oscar Hammerstein, II (who wrote the words) had a 50% share. They shared the royalties of that song and the hundreds of other songs they wrote together equally. The interesting thing is that Hammerstein got equal royalties even for instrumental versions. That is, even when his words were not used, only Rodgers\u2019 music, Hammerstein still got equal royalties. The reason for this is that a song prepared by two (or more) authors is considered in copyright law to be \u201cmerged into inseparable and interdependent parts of a unitary whole.\u201d As far as I know, every well-known two-person songwriting team shared their song ownership and their royalties equally, including George and Ira Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Goffin and King, Taupin and John, Bacharach and David, Leiber and Stoller, Lennon and McCartney, etc. Of course, other legal arrangements could be made prior to the publication of a song, in which one of the partners received a greater portion than 50% and the other a lesser portion. Such arrangements would have to be in writing and signed by the parties to be legal. Songs these days are often written by a committee of studio musicians. I recently performed a pop song that had 13 writers! Also, there is a thing called a \u201cwork for hire,\u201d that applies to either an employee working within the scope of his or her employment; or someone who has been specially commissioned to create a work. In that case, the employer or person who commissioned the work is the legal copyright owner and is entitled to all the royalties. The creator is usually paid some sort of flat fee. ",
