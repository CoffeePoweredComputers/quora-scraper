            "answer_text": "Forget a little about hitting notes: those notes sound \u201cshaky\u201d because they\u2019re too extreme for you and that\u2019s completely okay. Now you should get a good teacher, they\u2019ll be able to guide you properly. Meanwhile, please stop trying to push boundaries without proper training, it\u2019s really easy to do something wrong and get vocal damage, even permanent ones. Just try to sing songs that you like and search for what you\u2019re best at, only sing if it\u2019s comfortable for you, but getting some lessons are really important to advance. ",
