            "answer_text": "You ain't gonna get honest answer for this question of yours. Different people like different musical instruments. Musical instruments ain't like your computer or mobile phone which you compare by specifications. For example I love electric guitars and for me it's the most fantastic musical instrument. Then there are people who like other instruments like drums, sitar and other stuffs, for them they're the most fantastic musical instruments. So, long story in short, your question makes no sense and is kinda retarded. ",
