No matter what your natal chart looks like, make a concerted effort to get plenty of exercise, avoid junk food, keep sugar and cured meats to a bare minimum, and consume plenty of veggies, fruits and nuts. These steps are far more important than what your horoscope looks like. Please keep in mind that if you are seeking to understand and improve your health and longevity potential, your Sun sign alone is not going to yield insights. You cannot \u201cdumb down\u201d astrology to just 12 Sun signs. ",
