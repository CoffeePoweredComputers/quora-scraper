            "answer_text": "Of course it's not. Love is one of the most important things in society, and in my opinion, it stops many horrible things from happening. Think about it, a lot of tragedies are caused by people who have lost everything and have no one to love or love them, or by people who have just lost it. They are completely acting in the wrong, but they're not just acting out simply because they're horrible and violent people, they are acting out because, for a lot of people, love is what keeps them going. Problems don't seem as bad when you have a partner that helps support you, and just make you laugh and smile. A world without love would be a cold place, where a lot more people would be hostile and a lot more horrible things would happen. Some people go about finding love the wrong way nowadays, but if they're just in it for fun or for sex, then it's not really love. ",
