I think these four rappers and girl-crush women would be amazing as a group. They are all strong rappers. Ik a lot of you will disagree but I would put this group under YG Entertianment. Although YGE is not known for having the best management, I think they would definitely give the artists the most artistic freedom and after all, in Kpop YGE is the face of hip-hop, rap, swag, etc. Boy Group: Baekhyun of EXO as Main VocalistJungkook of BTS as Lead Vocalist, Maknae, Main DancerJinu of Winner as Vocalist, Visual, LeaderJune-hoe of iKON as Lead Vocalist, Lead DancerJaehyun of NCT as Vocalist, Lead Dancer, VisualThis group would be a visual/vocal group. All the members are very good looking and are talented vocalists. I would put them under SM Entertainment because SM is known for their amazing vocal training and outstanding visuals!! Co-Ed Group: Chanyeol of Exo as the Lead Rapper, Visual, Leader, CenterMingyu of Seventeen as the Main Rapper, Lead Dancer, Vocalist, MaknaeJisoo of Blackpink as the Lead Vocalist, Visual, FOTGSeulgi of Red Velvet as the Main Dancer, Main Vocalist, and Center.This group is a Visual group that can sing and rap. The concept is a group that is extremely good looking but also very talented. The groups weakest area is dancing but we have Seulgi it\u2019s fineee. lol I would put this group under JYP Entertainment because I feel JYP would handle co-ed groups the best out of the Big3\u2026 Hoped you liked my answer!!!I put a lot of time and thought into this so please upvote, share, comment, and follow!! Thanks~ ",
