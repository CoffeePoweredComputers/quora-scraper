            "answer_text": "Your focus should be on producing content that is interesting to you, before focusing on making money. The reason being is because 80% of new channels fail due to creators\u2019 impatience. \u201cI didn\u2019t get 100 subs in the first week? My videos have under 1000 views in the first month? I must suck at this, this isn\u2019t for me\u2026\u201dThe truth is you need TONS of patience, or you will not succeed on this platform - and so you won\u2019t make any money. Choose your niche (gaming/business?), choose a sub-niche (any particular game? Any specific business industry that hasn\u2019t been explored as much?), and stick to it. (Unless along the way you find something more interesting/something that your viewers would engage with more). 2. You start making money on YouTube after you join their monitisation program (which is available to you after x amount of views - they sometimes change this threshold, so in case this answer is read 2\u20133 years later, I will leave it blank). Once you reach the threshold, you will get approximately $1/1000 views (very rough estimation, this can really vary, and will depend on the total number of views on your channel as well). To make more money, look to improve content and put out a lot of videos from the start (it\u2019s a numbers game - sometimes quality can be preferred over quantity, but at the start you need to test to see what your audience really enjoys watching, so play around with the content). 3. I would recommend seeing how things go for at least 6 months (see what I mean by patience?), and only then if you are doing all the right things you will see first dollars/pounds/etc. trickling into your account. ($100 being the minimum threshold before the payout from AdSense) 4. Once you grow to a certain size (say, 50k subs), people will start reaching out to you, offering money in exchange for promoting their products. Product placement is another way to make money on YouTube. 5. Affiliate programs (for example recommending Amazon books in the video description) are another way to make extra money. (Bare in mind that you would need quite a substantial number of views, before you see this income grow - people don\u2019t like leaving YouTube via links). 6. Having a big regular sponsor is the most sustainable source of income for YouTubers, but that normally only happens after you reach a certain level of recognition. Good luck and remember - only do what you love! ",

            "answer_text": "Let me introduce you to the 1,000 True Fans rule. (I do not know who to credit for this, but it is not my original idea, I\u2019m sure you can find the owner on google) Imagine you have 1,000 true fans, and I mean dedicated fans, people you have given so much value to that they will buy anything you put out for sale. So you\u2019re a YouTuber, and you say \u201chey guys, I\u2019m putting out a t-shirt with my name on it. Would mean a lot to me if you bought it!\u201d and you did that one time a month for a year, your 1,000 true fans would buy every one with pride. 1,000 a month x ~$6 profit per shirt = $6,000 x 12 months = $72,000. There you go, that would support most individuals. Let\u2019s back up. I chose t-shirts because a lot of people do choose to sell merch, that\u2019s because they\u2019re capitalizing on their audience. If you want to make a living off of JUST YouTube paychecks, you\u2019ll need a pretty massive number of subscribers and you\u2019ll need to put videos out often, probably at least weekly. But if you strategically pick products, services, and other valuable content to sell to your audience, you suddenly need 10 times less subscribers to make a living from YouTube. In fact, when you launch the product (if it\u2019s actually a good product), your revenue from YouTube advertisements will probably become the lesser piece of the pie. Not to mention, when you get into certain numbers like 20,000 to 50,000 subscribers, you can start negotiating deals like \u201chey Company, I\u2019ll show your great organic tea in my video, and it will get 20,000 views from my fans, just pay me $250\u201d. This is called influencer marketing (the YouTubers are the \u201cinfluencers\u201d), and if it\u2019s done right, it\u2019s a great deal for the content creator and the company. Some of these deals reach into $1,000,000+ to show ONE product on just ONE video. Same type of thing when people say \u201cUse code \u2018myname\u2019 on this website when you sign up for 10% off.\u201d I\u2019ll give one more \u2014 affiliate links. Someone that makes photography tutorials will often have in their video descriptions a \u201cMY GEAR\u201d section, where they list all their cameras, lenses, backpacks, etc. with direct Amazon links so you can purchase the same great gear. If you click that specific link and purchase the camera, your favorite YouTuber will get a chunk of that profit, and it certainly can add up over time. There are more ways, but my point is, YouTubers have income coming from many different channels; a smart way to diversify in the face of a fairly unstable platform and career path. I reiterate \u2014 play it smart, and all you need is 1,000 true fans to make enough money to survive. ",
