            "answer_text": "Buy/borrow a guitar (doesn\u2019t have to be expensive or in great condition). Remove the 2 lowest pitched strings and the highest pitched string (that\u2019s the two thickest wound strings and the thinnest non-wound string). This leaves you with a chord of G when you strum the three remaining strings (D, G and B). Now all you do is: play the open strings 16 times then put you finger flat across the frets at the fifth fret and play that 8 times. Play the open strings again 8 times. Then fret seventh fret and strum that 4 times, down to fifth fret for 4 strums, open strings for 4 strums and then seventh fret again for 4 strums. If you do that and make sure your strums are evenly spaced then you now know how to play a basic blues chord progression in the chord of G. That\u2019s probably the fastest way to learn. Aim for one strum every 1 or 2 seconds at first. Speed comes naturally by itself but accuracy and evenness do not - those are the things you should concentrate on. Once you\u2019re good at them you just do them quicker to play faster. Playing fast is not inherently difficult. Don\u2019t worry about it and please don\u2019t waste your time and wind yourself up into knots trying to get faster because that\u2019s not how it works. Get efficient instead. Look at how far you lift your fingers above the frets when you\u2019re not fretting anything. That\u2019s something to work on. You want to stay very close to the strings at all times as the further you lift your finger the longer it takes to bring it down again and that physically imposes a speed limit on you. Practice that out as early as you can! Look at what happens when you pick the strings: how far does your pick travel? If you\u2019re strumming chords big movements are good as that improves feel and timing (watch Bon Jovi strumming his acoustic on stage for an example) but if you\u2019re playing rapid solo stuff you will probably find that minimising the movement helps (watch Yngwie Malmsteen to see an extreme version of this - I think it kind of looks like he\u2019s knitting/sewing). One of the hardest things to do is to play a single note and make it sound good without being allowed to use any effects or vibrato. In contrast to that, if you\u2019re playing a lightning-fast widdle containing 29 notes crammed into one second then most people won\u2019t notice if you get a couple of them slightly wrong. Slow and steady wins the race. Don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that what you\u2019re really doing isn\u2019t mentally learning anything or even memorising chord shapes - you\u2019re actually trying to train your muscles to do almost everything for you automatically so that you\u2019re then free to think about how you\u2019re playing what you\u2019re playing. The first time you pick up a guitar when you\u2019re blind drunk to the extent you can\u2019t even remember your name but your hands still remember entire songs you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. Effective practice will get you there quicker. The more times your muscles do something the more they will be able to do it instinctively. Do yourself a favour and make sure you\u2019re always teaching your muscles good stuff. Every time you shrug your shoulders at a difficult chord and just play a simplified version you\u2019re creating a limit for yourself in your future playing. Also, if you don\u2019t discover things which make you stumble when you practice then you\u2019re doing it wrong. Sure, you have to play some of the stuff you\u2019re already good at for confidence reasons but the more you can force yourself to work on the stuff which sounds awful the quicker you\u2019ll progress -if you\u2019re trying to learn a foreign language you won\u2019t make much progress if you spend all your time speaking in your native tongue. If you find that you\u2019re really good with your picking hand then you don\u2019t need to remove the E, A and E strings - just strum the D, G and B and avoid the other three. As you get better you can make the strumming pattern more adventurous and eventually put the other strings back on and learn some chord shapes, but in the meantime you can get by with the above method. You could also leave all the strings on but tune the strings down to D, A, D, F#, A and D so that you\u2019ve got an open chord - then you have to fret across all six strings which is a littler harder to do. Depending on your guitar this might require a truss-rod adjustment but probably not unless your action is insanely low to start with. ",

            "answer_text": "There isn't really any way for an individual to learn the acoustic guitar faster. However, you can learn more effectively. Getting better at the guitar is like going to the gym for body building or losing weight. You have to be persistent and consistent. Persistency will help you improve and acquire more skills, and consistency will help you keep it. You need to practise regularly and keep on doing the things you are failing at, otherwise you won't improve \u2014 this could be fast chord switching, memorizing scales, finger picking, or just playing faster in general. 15-30 minutes every day is better than 1 or 2 sessions that are several hours long per week. You need to play regularly because every new technique or scale you practise is something new your body is expanding its horizons into, and you need to do it consistently to keep getting used to it until it all becomes natural. A couple of years ago, I used to only learn how to play songs on the guitar - mostly Avenged Sevenfold and a bit of Metallica. As I kept on practising insane solos, I felt myself getting better and playing faster. However, one day during a lesson I showed my teacher a flamenco-style chord progression I came up with but upon his request, I couldn't improvise over it to save myself. It was at this moment that I knew I fucked up big time by neglecting music theory \u2014 scales, in particular; possibly the most important part. In short, you should start by learning basic scales (Minor pentatonic is the easiest shape to remember) as this will change your learning experience. Rather than learning songs as a means of improving, practise playing your scales and chromatic exercises at faster speeds with a metronome and also use said scales to improvise over backing tracks. Only then will you truly improve, while also making it more fun. Learning how to play through practising songs only gets you used to playing with the particular technique demanded by those songs and nothing more. Otherwise, you will play like shit \u2014 take it from me and a peer of mine who made the same mistake. ",
