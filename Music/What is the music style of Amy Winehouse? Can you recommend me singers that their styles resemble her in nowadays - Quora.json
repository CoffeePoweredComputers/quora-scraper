            "answer_text": "Amy Winehouse was a singular artist who only produced two albums, Frank and Back to Black. She grew up in a jazz household. Her uncles were professional jazz players, her grandmother was a jazz singer, and her parents\u2019 jazz albums were played non-stop. In her first album, her style was a combination of the Acid Jazz/Heavy Funk movement in London, Neo-Soul Movement on both sides of the Atlantic, and her beloved Ska, especially songs from The Specials. When she recorded Back to Black, the music took a leap in a different direction. Amy retained her Frank producer Salaam Remi, but added New York-based Mark Ronson, The Dap Kings as her band, and recorded in the Dap Kings\u2019 decidedly analog Brooklyn studio. Her songs and sound had matured, recalling the \u201cwall of sound\u201d American girl groups. Accolades were heaped on her, and it\u2019s been said that it opened the way for Adele, Duffy, and Estelle, although their success was mostly due to their own talent. I say all that because her music, based on her two albums, was trending towards something incredible. But her lifestyle and influences overcame her and snuffed out an artist who many believed was going to continue to produce music that acknowledged the past while being firmly in the present. ",

            "answer_text": "This is what last.fm had to say about the late Amy Winehouse :   ...known for her eclectic mix of various musical genres including soul, jazz, rock 'n' roll and Rhythm and Blues.Her musical formation went through listening to such jazz divas as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan; she was later influenced by contemporary metropolitan popular music as well. She represented a union of these aesthetics: a happy fusion of '40s jazz, '60s soul and hard texts inspired by daily life...  Artist recommendations similar to Winehouse (imho) : Lily Allen and Duffy in mainstream. Definitely Bob Dylan if classics interest you. I liked Sarah Vaughan style of jazz.  Hope this helped. ",
