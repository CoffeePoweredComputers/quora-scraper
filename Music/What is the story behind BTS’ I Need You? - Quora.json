            "answer_text": "I NEED U is part of the Most Beautiful Moment in Life Series. It's basically a non chronological summary of the BU fictional universe which put very simply is a fictional story that is told across content here's a list of the content officially confirmed by BigHit. You know them because they have a special logo in the video description. It connects to the prologue Butterfly, and the official BU music videos as well as the webtoon Save Me. So it's not just one story. It's a continuing one. Here is a gist of the BU universe. With all official information no theories. TIMELINE SO FAR: BU Content Guide Music Videos in the Bangtan Universe in order of release but not story order. 1.Bangtan Begins VCR after School Luv Affair 2. The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Prologue, song Butterfly 3. I NEED U Korean and Japan versions 4. RUN Korean and Japanese versions 5. Epilogue: Young Forever 6. All of the Wings Short Films 7. Blood Sweat and Tears 8. Highlight Reel, Love Yourself: Her 9. Euphoria, Love Yourself: Wonder 10. Fake Love, and Extended (Magic Shop) version 11. Epiphany Note: Contrary to popular belief Spring Day is NOT part of the BU. It's more likely a tribute video to the victims of the Sewol Ferry incident or to lost ones in general, it's basis is the scifi story: Those That Walk Away From Omelas. Album Notes: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Love Yourself All albums: Her, Tear, Answer Map of Soul: Persona The: Smeraldo Books compilation Trigger warnings: Suicide, abandonment accidental deaths, abuse, violence, and murder though it's the comics that go into it while the music videos tend to show more implications of the above. The BU Story in the simplest terms In highschool Seokjin followed in the footsteps of his father by making selfish decisions and protecting himself instead of standing by his friends. This caused the group to drift apart and as a result of losing eachother, they get in trouble some landing in jail, others committing suicide as a result of not being able to cope with their VERY dark pasts. These are briefly shown in I NEED U. Seokjin left school after betraying his friends and comes back two years later on April 11th. He sees Namjoon at the gas station working but doesn't say anything. He later on May 22nd decided to check on him to find out he's in jail and each of the members all met a terrible fate. Seokin goes back to the beach near the wishing rock his friends were trying to find years ago and wishes for things to be different and is granted the ability to turn back time and fix everything. He tries to save his friends, but it causes a Butterfly Effect which makes everything even worse each time. He becomes obssessed with fixing things, going back multiple times as things snowball. I NEED U is sort of introduction to the BU and shows each character's backstory along with the fates Seokjin needs to save the members from. (For each member it seems to be the unaltered original timeline except for JungKook\u2019s car accident.) Simply put: >The original timeline JungKook committed suicide on April 11th up to that point he feels abandoned by his family and friends and gets into fights on purpose. (I NEED U also shows him get hit by a car which is another instance in which he dies probably in alternate timelines.) >Namjoon got in a fight with a customer at the gas station he works at and was arrested >Yoongi gets drunk and sets himself on fire on May 2nd as his own mother died in a fire a few years before and he can't cope after Seokjin's actions cause him to be expelled he has no one to turn to. >Jimin tried to drown himself in the bathtub because he has trauma from something that happened in the arboretum when was 7. He gets seizures because of it and his parents won't let him out of the hospital. In the Webcomic he tries on May 12th. >Hoseok was abandoned at age 7 by his mother and as a result of trauma he has Munchausen Syndrome where he thinks he's sick but isn't. He faints on the bridge because he thinks he's narcoleptic. Later he sees someone that looks like her in the hospital and falls down the stairs. >Taehyung originally murdered his father for abusing his sister May 20 and was arrested May 22nd. In an alternate timeline Taehyung commits suicide by jumping into the ocean (Butterfly) because Namjoon is not able to pick up his distressed phonecall after he kills his father. >JungKook gets hit by a car on May 22 if he doesn't die on April 11th. Of note: The moment any member including him dies, Seokjin will wake up on April 11th. Other timelines change dates and times of events but the members all still meet bad fates causing Seokjin to constantly rewind. Thus is the loop. Seokjin wished to travel back in time on the original May 22nd and returned to April 11th to fix everything and keeps going back to April 11th as he can't get to May 22nd without someone dying. (Until he figures out a solution in Euphoria) This formed a timeloop between those two dates. Also of note is the prologue: The members go to the beach on 2 dates. June 12 in their first year of highschool they skip school and take a picture. They then go back on May 22nd 2 years later ONLY if Seokjin stops them from dying before then. May 22nd is what we see in the prologue as Taeyhung jumping messes things up again. I NEED U shows us why Taehyung jumped in the prologue. RUN shows Seokjin's attempts to fix the timeline by going back multiple times and we see the different timelines. Some of these events eventually lead into the solutions he finds in Euphoria. For instance, he lets Hoseok faint on the bridge so he can reunite Jimin at the hospital (shown in the scene where they pillow fight, and this makes it so Jimin stops Hoseok from falling down the stairs) thus saving Jimin from drowning himself when Hoseok suggests breaking out of the hospital in Euphoria. The times where he fails are also shown in detail in the Save Me Webcomic. We see Seokjin rewind time multiple times leading to multiple outcomes. Taehyung dreams about the other timelines and so we see those events unfold as he drowns in the second timeline. He's basically dreaming of himself drowning. Of note: Taehyung is shown knocking over Seokjin's house of cards, because he is the factor that messes up Seokjin's plans when he thinks everything has been resolved. Also JungKook catches on early to Seokjin\u2019s power as he was supposed to die in one of two instances and probably had been hit by a car in other timelines, in the end Jin hits him with his car so he's only injured and JungKook remembers this. We also see the timeline where he gets hit in I Need U. In Euphoria Seokjin goes up instead of Taehyung breaking the loop but bad things continue to happen because Taehyung remembers from his dreams that he was the one supposed to climb the platform and they fight instead driving the group apart again. The Wings series flesh out the members backstories using inspiration from Damien by Herman Hess. Blood Sweat and Tears both versions summarize and add more detail to events in the timeline showing them in a very surreal manner (also Damien inspired). Fake Love shows Seokjin breaking time basically by going back so much and still failing. Extended version goes into each member\u2019s fears and positive counter to that fear as they trade objects in the magic shop related to their back story and Highlight Reel. Euphoria shows how Seokin actually breaks the first timeloop and saves all the members before more bad things happened again. Each scene is an alternate of those in I NEED U. and The Highlight Reel and Epiphany are about him realizing he needs to be himself and become a better person if he's going to save his friends from a cycle of suffering. These events are all supplemented by the album notes, the Smeraldo books and the Save Me Webtoon which basically summarizes the events of I NEED U and RUN which is the basis for why Jin had to time travel in the first place. Hopefully that makes it clearer! Edit: Added more details for clarification Sources: All Official BU content authorized by BigHit mostly music videos and notes BU Content Guide (Unofficial) ",

            "answer_text": "Each of the seven boys tells a specific story, and the combined music video tells the story of the pain and hardships of youth. The song by itself is about the dying relationship between two lovers. In the context of the music video, it is about the dying relationship between a young person and their, well, basically their youth, happiness, and even life. The common theme is that even though the boys have their own individual problems, they were able to forget them when together, having a good time. If we break down each individual member\u2019s significance to the story, in order of age\u2026  Jungkook- Estrangement His character is a wandering, lost teen. He accidentally starts a fight with two hoodlums (fun fact: played by the managers) but he doesn\u2019t have the willpower to fight back, or maybe avoid conflict. Likewise when he walks into the street as a car approaches. What Jungkook represents, especially as the youngest member, is a lack of hope and motivation that plagues many youth today. V-Independence V kills his father. Mull over that for a bit. In the context of an extremely filial Korean culture, this is extremely symbolic. Much like the younger boy, he becomes very distant from guiding figures: father, home, and friends. The latter is especially noticeable in the Prologue and Stigma videos. Jimin- Depression He tries to drown himself but can\u2019t do it. Not knowing how to deal with his problems, he turns to suicide, but something is holding him back, keeping him alive. This is most likely the presence of his friends. When the seven boys are shown together, they are happy and can temporarily forget their inner struggles.  Rap Monster- Duty and Repressed Self He works at a gas station where he is mistreated by the customer, and is the only member who is seen rapping/singing in the music video: \u201cIt goes round and round\u2026I go down and down\u2026I\u2019m talking to myself again.\u201d His job is boring, Rap Monster the rapper seems out of place, but there is nothing else to do. The lollipop that turns into a cigarette stands for people who try to repress their addiction to harmful, \u201cadult,\u201d substances like nicotine, and replace it with something harmless like sugar. The addicted adult inside Rap Monster who wants passion, music, maybe drugs, is confined to the gas attendant lollipop man. J-Hope: Depression and Sickness He, like Jimin, is clearly suicidal as he is seen attempting to overdose on his medication. Being with his friends provides respite from his demons; he burns the pills in the bonfire. Suga- Self-Hatred This is pretty obvious, considering he tries to burn himself alive and his lyrics can be summed up to \u201cI hate this; I hate life; I hate you.\u201d As with most of the boys, we don\u2019t know what the cause of his struggles is, just that they are there and very big.  Jin- Growing Up Jin\u2019s scenes are much lighter than the other members\u2019\u2014literally, he is in a white room\u2014but not without pain. The six flower petals shown represent beauty and youth. However, they also stand for the six friends who, in turn, represent the bad and ugly of youth. The oldest and most mature, Jin\u2019s character is very conflicted about leaving youth. Maybe he doesn't want to become a boring, soulless adult, but he has to leave behind the recklessness and hardship of youth that can be so treasured, like good friends. And that\u2019s it. BTS doesn\u2019t tell us how the story of the seven troubled youths ends, or what it all means. This is partly because their stories aren\u2019t over yet. They also don\u2019t try to explain they whys, hows, wheres, whats, of the music video. It\u2019s entirely up to the viewer. What I\u2019ve written is how the video spoke its message to me, and it is my great pleasure to pass this on to you, just as BTS passed their stories to me and (namjoon voice:) ARMYs all over the world.
