            "answer_text": "I think you mean a trademark, where only one company can use that word. It it were copyrighted, your sentence above would be illegal copyright infringement. No, K-pop is just a description, like the words \u201cbakery\u201d or \u201ccamera\u201d. You cannot copyright a single word and trademark registrations cannot be done on descriptions. The \u201cCanon 5D camera\u201d is a trademark that includes the word camera, but I cannot register just the word camera and prevent Nikon from describing their products with that name. ",
