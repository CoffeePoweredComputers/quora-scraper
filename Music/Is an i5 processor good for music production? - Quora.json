            "answer_text": "Impossible to answer accurately, because the i5 CPU (which i5, there have been many) is only one portion of the computer, all of which must work effectively to be good for music production. Another way of answering: a properly configured computer system with a modern i5, generous amount of RAM and fast storage and a good audio interface, and good music production software properly installed, can be a good system for music production.

            "answer_text": "First up, I5 is a very long line of processors, so I\u2019m just going to assume you are talking about the 10600 and 10600K processors. And I\u2019m going to have to say this. If you are producing as a hobby, get a 10600K. If it is a job, get an I7 10700K. Also, I would recommend an amd cpu for anything but music production. ",
