            "answer_text": "I believe that Kanye West is the best and most creative musician working in the world today, in any idiom or genre. Here\u2019s a draft of a paper I\u2019m working on that explains why. A few months ago, I was invited to participate in a tutorial session entitled \u201cWhy Hip-Hop Is Interesting\u201d at the 2016 International Society for Music Information Retrieval conference. A typical pop music listener might find it surprising that such a tutorial would be necessary. Hip-hop is the most listened-to music genre in the world, at least among Spotify listeners (Hooton 2015). Surely a musical form with such a broad global impact must be interesting. After the tutorial, however, several audience members remarked that they had never heard rap songs analyzed so closely; one said that it had never occurred to her to think about rap music at all. These conference attendees are representative of the music academy generally. Hip-hop has received significant scholarly attention in recent years, but that has mostly been in the context of cultural studies. When humanities scholars engage with hip-hop as an art form, the focus is usually on the lyrics, reading them as a subgenre of African-American literature that just happens to be performed over beats. Interesting though rap lyrics are, it is not sufficient to study them outside of their musical context. \u201cWe need to begin to hear not only what these rappers are saying, but also what these musicians are composing - how they are using rhythm, rhyme, and rhetoric to enact survival and celebration, clamor and community\u201d (Walser 1995, 212). Why do music theorists so rarely examine hip-hop for its musical content? Perhaps it is due in part to the way that hip-hop focuses on rhythm so much more heavily than other musical dimensions. The jazz drummer Max Roach characterizes hip-hop as \u201crhythm for rhythm\u2019s sake\u201d (quoted in Lipsitz 1994, 37). Theorists trained to understand music in terms of harmonic and thematic development might therefore not expect to find much in rap to interest them. I intend to demonstrate that, to the contrary, hip-hop has rich musical interest beyond its rhythmic innovations, using the example of Kanye West\u2019s song \u201cFamous,\u201d from his album The Life Of Pablo (2016).  A note about authorship: Contemporary hip-hop is a collaborative art form, especially in the upper commercial echelon where West resides. West made his name as a producer, but on \u201cFamous\u201d he did not work alone. The album credits list West and Havoc as the producers, with co-production by Noah Goldstein, Charlie Heat, and Andrew Dawson, and additional production by Hudson Mohawke, Mike Dean, and Plain Pat. West is the author of \u201cFamous\u201d in the same sense that Steven Spielberg is the author of \u201cE.T.\u201d\u2014he supervised a creative team, rather than doing all of the hands-on work himself. West does not discuss his creative process in detail, so it is difficult to know what specific role all of his collaborators played. For the purposes of this article, when I refer to a musical decision as having been made \u201cby\u201d West, I mean that it was made by West along with any combination of the other producers listed above. \u201cFamous\u201d was immediately embroiled in controversy upon its release due to its part in the ongoing highly-publicized feud between West and Taylor Swift. It is beyond the scope of post to address the controversy; the popular press has covered it exhaustively, and in any event, it is peripheral to the song\u2019s musical interest. For present purposes, we can acknowledge the feud\u2019s existence, and move on. The music video for \u201cFamous\u201d has been another source of extramusical controversy. It is a ten minute art film that shows West in bed sleeping after what appears to be a group sexual encounter with his wife, Kim Kardashian West; his former lover, Amber Rose; his wife\u2019s former lover, Ray J.; her mother, Kaitlyn Jenner; West\u2019s frequent collaborator Rihanna and her former lover, Chris Brown; West\u2019s high-profile nemeses Taylor Swift, Anna Wintour, and George W. Bush; and, for no obvious reason, Bill Cosby and Donald Trump. While this video is richly interesting, it is once again beyond the scope of the present analysis, which focuses only on the aural content of the song. Suffice to say that in his videos as in his music, West embodies the way that hip-hop \u201ctakes pleasure in aggressive insubordination\u201d (Rose 1994, 80). West\u2019s lyrics in \u201cFamous\u201d carry their share of aggressive insubordination. Like many of his songs, this one uses problematic and offensive language. In the first verse alone, West greets \u201call the Southside n****rs that know me best\u201d and calls Taylor Swift \u201cthat bitch.\u201d I am reluctant to fall into the cliche of the white hip-hop critic who celebrates the music\u2019s sonic innovations while judging its regressive lyrics (Chapman 2008, 157). I do not want to patronize West, who for all I know is using this racially charged and misogynistic language ironically or critically. While discussing his collaboration with West on his earlier album Yeezus, the singer Justin Vernon observes: \u201cKanye feels like a director, and I don't think everything he's saying in the songs is actually him saying it every time. It's like a movie, or a concept\u201d (quoted in Dombal 2013). Perhaps we can read the opening verse of \u201cFamous\u201d as a playful boast or taunt. Rose (1994) points out that for all of its technological innovations, rap music \u201chas also remained critically linked to black poetic traditions and the oral forms that underwrite them. These oral traditions and practices clearly inform the prolific use of collage, intertextuality, boasting, toasting, and signifying in rap's lyrical style and organization\u201d (84). We can also regard the function of West\u2019s lyrics not as conveying particular meaning, but rather as being the topmost layer of a bed of rhythmic sound. Adams (2008) encourages us to hear rap lyrics this way, especially in a song like this one: \u201cIn rap songs whose lyrics do not seem to have a single unifying theme or narrative\u2026 the best approach is first to disregard the semantic meaning of the lyrics, and to treat the syllables of text simply as consonant/vowel combinations that occupy specific metrical locations\u201d ([12]). While West has written albums worth of songs with clear narrative and autobiographical meaning, \u201cFamous\u201d has neither. Furthermore, in addition to West, the song features four additional vocalists whose lyrics also resist literal interpretation. We can feel some confidence that in this case, as in many rap songs, \u201cthe music comes both logically and chronologically before the text, and the meaning of the text is often secondary to its interaction with the music\u201d (Adams 2008, [43]). \u201cFamous\u201d has an unusual structure for a mainstream hip-hop song. The graphic below shows the audio file in Ableton Live\u2019s Arrange view.  The sections are color-coded as follows: yellow for the intro, orange for the instrumental break, blue for verses, green for the hook/chorus, brown for a groove section that will be discussed in detail below, and pale yellow for the outtro. Aside from the brief instrumental interlude, every section of \u201cFamous\u201d is six, twelve, or twenty-four bars long. For example, the verses are three sets of four-bar phrases. This is highly unusual for the genre; hip-hop songs are almost always built on phrases that are eight, sixteen or thirty-two bars long. \u201cBecause of the high degree of repetition, the short length of repeated units, and clear formal boundaries demarcated by changes in text, texture, and other parameters, structural patterns of larger units such as phrases and sections are generally more perceptually salient in vernacular music than in many forms of art music\u201d (Biamonte 2014, [1.2]). The factor-of-three-length phrases in \u201cFamous\u201d thus represent a mild but noticeable hypermetrical dissonance. The six bar intro consists of Rihanna singing over a subtle gospel-flavored organ accompaniment in F-sharp major. She sings a few lines from \u201cDo What You Gotta Do\u201d by Jimmy Webb. This country/pop standard has been recorded many times, but for West, and presumably his listeners, Nina Simone\u2019s 1968 recording is likely to be the most meaningful reference point. Simone carries clear significance for West; he has sampled her on two previous releases, \u201cBlood On The Leaves\u201d (2013) and \u201cBad News\u201d (2008). Having Rihanna interpolate Nina Simone is the first of many intertextual moments in \u201cFamous.\u201d Walser (1995) cites veteran hip-hop producer Hank Shocklee as \u201carguing for a view of music as something discursive and social, created out of dialogue with other people in the past and the present rather than through some sort of parthogenesis\u201d (196). West begins his song with a literal dialog between African-American music\u2019s past, as embodied by Simone, and its present, as embodied by Rihanna. After Rihanna\u2019s intro comes a four-bar groove, a more aggressive organ part over a drum machine beat, with Swizz Beatz ad libbing on top. This beat and organ sample were created by Havoc, and were the first elements of the track to be created (Preezy 2016). The drum part is a minimal funk pattern on kick and snare. The snares fall on the backbeats, with the kick playing more complex syncopated patterns around them. As in the James Brown grooves that inspired so many hip-hop producers, \u201cthe emphasis of the downbeat grounds the groove while setting up the playfulness of the rest of the phrase\" (Greenwald 2008, 268).  Aside from the kick drums on each downbeat, the snare drum hits on beats two and four are the most stable element in the rhythm. If there is a single unifying feature of hip-hop, it is the omnipresent accented backbeat. While the syncopation represented by the backbeat is traditionally thought of as a rhythmic equivalent to tension or dissonance, American vernacular forms like rock and hip-hop make beats two and four rhythmically consonant through sheer force of repetition. \u201cBecause it is an essential component of the meter, functioning as a timeline\u2014a rhythmic ostinato around which the other parts are organized\u2014I consider the backbeat in rock music to be an instance of displacement consonance rather than dissonance\u201d (Biamonte 2014, [6.2]). While the \u201cFamous\u201d beat references classic hip-hop\u2019s basis in funk, its timbre is futuristic, soaked in cavernous artificial reverb. This conspicuously unnatural sense of space is a world away from the organic-sounding soul samples underpinning West\u2019s first few albums. The move into increasingly otherworldly timbres is in keeping with the broader sweep of popular music. In 1990, Goodwin pointed out that \u201cpop musicians and audiences have grown increasingly accustomed to making an association between synthetic/automated music and the communal (dance floor) connection to nature (via the body). We have grown used to connecting machines and funkiness\u201d (55). Chapman (2008) describes the production style of West\u2019s contemporary Tim \u201cTimbaland\u201d Mosely as evoking \u201ca sonic no-place, where the dancing body resides as a starkly minimal, mechanical trace of the more \u2018human\u2019 breakbeats that earlier rap production would sample from 1960s or 1970s soul\u201d (169). Most contemporary hip-hop combines dance rhythms and party-oriented lyrics with bleakly posthuman electronic timbres. West pushes this juxtaposition to the extreme. Swizz Beatz ad-libs gruffly over the brief introductory groove, as he does over much of the rest of the song\u2014in fact, he is present during a larger portion of the track than West himself. His ad-libs are almost free of semantic meaning, functioning completely as percussion. We can take one interjection more literally, the announcement that \u201cWe gon\u2019 let the beat rock.\u201d Swizz Beatz is inviting us to relax into an open-ended groove. We could imagine a DJ extending this section in a club or party setting if the crowd is responding energetically. The tidy loop structures of hip-hop and electronic dance tracks are designed to make it easy for DJs to spontaneously extend them at will. Since its origins lie in social dance, groove-based music exists to create a mood rather than a narrative. As Walser (1995) observes: \u201cBecause the groove itself is non-teleological, it situates the listener in a complex present, one containing enough energy and richness that progress seems moot\u201d (204). While looping in the studio and the DJ booth alike are achieved through highly technological means, the musical impulse is warmly organic: to foster dance, socializing, or head-nodding. The organ riff that runs throughout the verses of \u201cFamous\u201d is in F-sharp minor, which is an abrupt mode change from the major tonality of the intro section. West\u2019s co-producer Havoc sampled the organ from the closing section of \u201cMi Sono Svegliato E\u2026Ho Chiuso Gli Occhi\u201d by Il Rovescio della Medaglia, an Italian progressive rock band. This song is itself built around quotes of Bach\u2019s Well-Tempered Clavier, making a pleasingly recursive chain of musical reference.  Rap music has been criticized extensively for the practice of sampling. There is a widespread perception that sampling is nothing more than an expedient way to avoid learning instruments or hiring musicians. In this instance, however, using the organ sample was not much more expedient than recording a soundalike would have been. Given the generic simplicity of this organ riff, it would have been a trivial matter for West to replace it using a similar organ sound from any number of software instruments. Why, then, was West willing to take on the expense of the sample clearance and licensing fee? We must assume that he was drawn to the specific ambiance of the sample, because it allowed him \u201cto signify upon a different kind of space and distance, the long perspective of passing time\u2026 [T]he materiality of these recorded samples, their saturation with buzz and crackle, intensified their demarcation of a distance between past and present\u201d (Chapman 2008, 160). West has built his entire discography on carefully selected samples. In his output as in hip-hop generally, \u201c[e]xisting recordings are not randomly or instrumentally incorporated so much as they become the simultaneous subject and object of a creative work\u201d (Culter 1989, 21). Verse one continues over Havoc\u2019s drum machine and organ, with West alternating between aggressive rap and loosely pitched singing. West is more highly regarded as a producer than a rapper, but his flow is nevertheless distinctive. In rap terms, the word \u201cflow\u201d encompasses both emcees\u2019 lyric writing and the rhythmic and articulative aspects of of their delivery. The metrical aspects of flow include the placement of rhyming or otherwise accented syllables, the relationship between lyrical phrase boundaries and musical hypermeasures, and the number of syllables per beat. The articulative aspects include the use of legato or staccato, the articulation of consonants or lack thereof, and the placement of any given syllable ahead of or behind the beat (Adams 2009). Most contemporary emcees use what Krims (2000) has called a \u201cspeech-effusive style\u201d characterized by the casual enunciation and loose rhythms of everyday spoken language. This is in contrast to two other major flow styles described by Krims. One is \"sung,\" a schoolyard chant feel with on-beat accents and strict couplet groupings, characteristic of the first generation of rappers like Run-DMC and Kurtis Blow. The other is \"percussion-effusive,\" a more rhythmically complex flow that is freer with metrical boundaries and rhyme schemes, but which still has crisp articulation and clearly discernable regular rhythm patterns. This pattern is more typical of a later cohort of rappers like Rakim and Q-Tip. West\u2019s flow is mostly speech-effusive, but in \u201cFamous,\u201d his rhymes have a simpler chant-like quality harkening back to early rap. It is a widely held belief that rap has no melodic content. However, attentive listening reveals that all rappers use pitch expressively. The border between rapping and singing is a porous one, and most emcees cross it routinely in the course of a song, as West does in \u201cFamous.\u201d Furthermore, even in straight rapping, the pitch sequences are deliberate and meaningful. The pitches might not fall on the piano keys, but they are melodic nonetheless. The easiest way to explore the pitch content of rap is to use pitch-tracking software on acapella tracks. Sadly, there is no acapella version of \u201cFamous\u201d available. However, West delivers one line in the second verse \u201cin the clear\u201d (without instrumental backing), making it amenable to automated pitch detection. The graphic below shows the line as visualized in Melodyne, with lyric annotations by the author:  With the assistance of the audio-to-MIDI feature of Ableton Live, it is possible to map these pitches to the closest piano-key note.  Even this short fragment shows considerable melodic interest, starting and ending on B3, with a leap up to D4 and drops to G3 in between. Melodic analysis of rap vocals is a largely untapped vein of potential scholarly inquiry, and a promising area of future research. After the first verse would conventionally come the \u201chook,\u201d the hip-hop term for a chorus. Rihanna continues to interpolate the Jimmy Webb/Nina Simone quote from the intro over the F-sharp major organ part from the intro. Swizz Beatz continues his ad-libbed interjections on top. While his function on the track is mostly to add rhythmic energy, in this section he also adds another layer of intertextuality by quoting \u201cWake Up Mr. West,\u201d a short skit on West\u2019s album Late Registration. That skit, in turn, is itself richly intertextual\u2014it features a comedian (DeRay Davis) imitating another comedian (Bernie Mac) over a sample of \u201cSomeone That I Used To Love\u201d by Natalie Cole (1980).  Verse two is much like verse one. At the end, we expect Rihanna to return with the hook, but instead we only hear her sing the pickup, \u201cI just wanted you to know.\u201d In place of the hook, the track shifts into a new F-sharp major groove over fuller drums, including a noisy artificial snare sound resembling a socket wrench. The lead vocal in this section is a sample of \u201cBam Bam\u201d by Sister Nancy (1982).  \u201cBam Bam\u201d is a frequently-used sample, one that a more-than-casual rap listener is likely to find familiar. The author immediately recognized it from \u201cLost Ones\u201d by Lauryn Hill (1998), \u201cJust Hangin\u2019 Out\u201d by Main Source (1991), and a variety of unofficial mixtapes. West does not merely sample \u201cBam Bam.\u201d He also reharmonizes it. Sister Nancy\u2019s original is a I\u2013bVII progression in C Mixolydian. West pitch shifts the vocal to fit it over a I\u2013V\u2013IV\u2013V progression in F-sharp major. Rather than simply transposing the sample up or down a tritone, he instead keeps the pitches close to their original values by changing their chord function. Here is a transcription of Sister Nancy\u2019s original:  And here is the sample as it appears in \u201cFamous\u201d:  Pitch shifting a vocal by even a small interval alters its timbre. The formants are transposed in parallel with the base pitch, rather than staying constant as they would if the vocalist were actually singing at the new pitch. Also, the phase vocoding that makes it possible to alter pitch independently of tempo further colors the sound. The resulting sonic artifacting gives Sister Nancy the feel of a robot from the future. This association directly conflicts with the lo-fidelity recording artifacts in the sample. As with the Nina Simone interpolation and drum machine part, the juxtaposition of audio past and future represented by the Sister Nancy sample has an otherworldly effect. Like the Il Rovescio della Medaglia song discussed above, Sister Nancy\u2019s song is comprised of pre-existing musical elements. She is singing over a widely used instrumental track (a \u201criddim\u201d in reggae parlance) called \u201cStalag 17\u201d by Winston Riley (1973). Furthermore, her chorus is a quote from a song of the same name by Toots Hibbert (1966). There is a pleasing symmetry between her collage aesthetic and West\u2019s. We cannot be certain whether West selected \u201cBam Bam\u201d on that basis, or because of its lyrics, its melody, its sound, or some motivation known only to him. But it is interesting to speculate. \u201cThe arrangement and selection of sounds rap musicians have invented via samples, turntables, tape machines, and sound systems are at once deconstructive (in that they actually take apart recorded musical compositions) and recuperative (because they recontextualize these elements creating new meanings for cultural sounds that have been relegated to commercial wastebins)\u201d (Rose 1994, 85). What new meaning does West create for \u201cBam Bam\u201d by including it within \u201cFamous\u201d? Sister Nancy\u2019s chorus means \u201cWhat a bummer\u201d in Jamaican patois. She is referring to her struggles to make it as an emcee in the male-dominated world of dancehall reggae. Does West intend that meaning to rub against the casual misogyny of his own verses? After twenty-four bars of the Sister Nancy groove, the track ends with another Jimmy Webb/Nina Simone quote. But this time, rather than Rihanna singing, we hear a sample of Simone herself.  West has combined an interpolation of a sample with the original recording before, on \u201cGold Digger\u201d (2005), in which Jamie Foxx\u2019s imitation of Ray Charles is followed by a sample of Charles himself. However, that juxtaposition occurred at the very beginning of the track. In \u201cFamous,\u201d Simone\u2019s first appearance comes at the end, and on first hearing comes as quite a surprise. We can read West\u2019s bringing Rihanna and Simone together on his song as a form of bragging. Few producers can afford a guest appearance by Rihanna. Similarly few have the resources or the audacity to sample a sacred and iconic figure like Simone. By doing both, is West engaged a kind of musical conspicuous consumption, the sonic equivalent of flashy jewelry? Or does he intend a deeper musical meaning? Holm-Hudson (1997) observes that John Oswald\u2019s sampling practice \u201ccreates a larger web of stylistic references from the interaction of various formerly unrelated samples. Oswald's technique, in particular, often extricates extramusical meaning from the \u2018innocent\u2019 sample, ironically commenting on its source, the sampled artist or the music industry that spawned both\u201d (Holm-Hudson 1997, 24). This analysis applies neatly to West\u2019s use of Simone as we compare it retroactively to Rihanna\u2019s interpolation. West presumably wants us to feel the contrast between Rihanna\u2019s heavily processed purr and Simone\u2019s unvarnished, preacherly tone. Reynolds (2012) comments on the way that recorded music in general and sampling in particular can create uncanny links across time: \u201cRecording is pretty freaky, then, if you think about it. But sampling doubles its inherent supernaturalism. Woven out of looped moments that are like portals to far-flung times and places, the sample collage creates a musical event that never happened; a mixture of time-travel and s\u00e9ance\u201d (313). By sampling Simone, West invites us to wonder what she might have made of Rihanna, and of West himself. Below, the author has constructed a flowchart showing the samples and samples of samples in \u201cFamous.\u201d  We can classify the samples in \u201cFamous\u201d using the typology of sampled material proposed by Ratcliffe (2014). The kick and snare are short, isolated fragments. The organ riff is a phrase, a self-referential musical element, rather than a pointer to a recognized external source. The Sister Nancy and Nina Simone samples are larger, more extensive referential elements. While sampling is ubiquitous in hip-hop, \u201cFamous\u201d is remarkable for deploying samples at so many different time scales. In interviews, West rarely gives specific insight into his creative process. We are forced to surmise as to how \u201cFamous\u201d came about in the studio after Havoc brought in the beat and organ sample. Gelineck and Serafin (2009) describe two major approaches to creating electronic music. The producer (who Gelineck and Serafin refer to as \u201cthe composer\u201d) may start with a clear goal or idea of the finished product. Alternatively, the producer may be inspired by playful exploration and experimentation using whatever sound sources and technologies are at hand. As quoted in Preezy (2016), Havoc describes West as having \u201cthe idea for how he wanted to go\u201d with \u201cFamous.\u201d Havoc also describes a process by which West\u2019s collaborators will introduce ideas in the studio for West to react to in the moment. Taken together, these remarks suggest that West combines both a goal-oriented and a playful/experimental approach to composition. West\u2019s music provokes strong emotional responses. In the process of writing this paper, the author discussed it with various friends and students. Their comments ranged from enthusing about West as a genius to denouncing him as an egotistical buffoon. Similarly, their assessments of \u201cFamous\u201d run the gamut from proclaiming it a masterpiece to dismissing it as offensive and empty. As Walser (1995) observes: \u201cHip hop's appeal to a variety of audiences, its cultural legitimacy, and its vulnerability to censorship all depend upon reactions to the music: whether its repetition enervates or animates, whether its noisiness alienates or accreditates, whether its complexity disorients or situates\u201d (210). In \u201cFamous,\u201d we are reacting to a dense interplay of rhythms, harmonies, timbres, vocal styles, and intertextual meanings, not to mention all the complexities of cultural context. How do we even begin to evaluate such a work? Like many rappers, West praises himself for being \u201cfresh.\u201d The meaning of the word in hip-hop slang could be referencing any of its conventional senses: new, refreshing, appetizing, attractive, or sassy (Hein 2015). We frequently praise music for its originality, but in sample-based music like hip-hop, that term is not as good a proxy for musical quality. We need a criterion that gets at the aspects of a successful rap song: emotional truth-telling, inventive wordplay, creative juxtaposition of existing and novel musical elements, the construction of a compelling soundscape, a beat suitable for dancing or head nodding, and situatedness within a complex cultural context. We can best judge hip-hop by its freshness. \u201cFamous\u201d is a difficult and at times unpleasant work, but it is extraordinarily fresh. References Adams, K. (2009).

            "answer_text": "Musically, he's one of the best. He\u2019s ever changing his style. He\u2019s been in the game for almost 10 years now, and he\u2019s arguably as strong as ever. That\u2019s mainly because he never makes two of the same albums. For example, College Dropout was innovative in backpack rap and provided a fun album that wsa really laid back, yet strong; Late Registration dropped some soulful melodies with some of his top notch bars, creating an orchestral album which provided insight into the pain of everyday life and some boss posse cuts, i.e. Gone; Graduation was a twist on modern radio rap, but he was able to do so whilst keeping his lyrical and production-wise integrity. He was able to take the least respected of rap genres at a time when rap was considered dying, and twist it into an arguable classic album; 808\u2019s & Heartbreak took modern, mundane autotune and showed us the real pain behind his asshole facade, providing a depressing album about the struggles of love and loss; My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is arguably Kanye\u2019s magnum opus. In it, he brought together some of the least expected of rappers, and handed them a mic with which they dropped some of the best guest verses of all time. For example: Nicki\u2019s verse on MonsterRozay\u2019s on Devil in a New Dress.Also, Kanye made some of his deepest songs in this album, creating an experience that felt more like a ballet or show than an album; Yeezus was an experimental album which created some of the biggest debates of the year. With Yeezus, he was able to tell white-America, to their faces (through SNL performances and etc) that racism is still alive and our nation is fucked up, there\u2019s no one but you to blame, and he WILL NOT let them get away with it. He was able to create a dark album, with raw emotion and anger, that said that he WILL NOT let middle-America control him and let him but the infamous \u201cpink polo\u201d back on. So, that\u2019s personally why I love Kanye: because he never gets boring; just when he starts to seem like he\u2019s falling off or leveling out, he\u2019ll smack you in the face with something completely original. If you appreciate any rap that is post 1990\u2019s, then you can find a Kanye album to appreciate. Now, choose the album that you think suits your tastes best from above, leave and feel enlightened, my good sir. ",
