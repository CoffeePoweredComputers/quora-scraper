            "answer_text": "Your CDs and iTunes songs are licensed for personal & private home enjoyment, so you can always share those with friends in your home (even if you put them on a slideshow or PowerPoint to share in your home). But the moment you post that online or play it in a public setting or put it on a DVD to share, the copyright law comes into play. If you upload it through YouTube\u2019s server, that\u2019s considered distribution (even if you make it private or unlisted) and so it\u2019s subject to their Terms of Service and U.S. Copyright law. The only way to upload a video containing copyrighted audio or video clips and not eventually receive a copyright flag is to obtain permission from the copyright holder. Ideally you would have done this before you posted it, but since you\u2019ve received copyright notifications, click those to see who the intellectual property rights owner is (usually a company or agency) and review what remedy they\u2019re proposing. If they\u2019ve opted to simply monetize it (run ads on your video) or block it in some countries and you\u2019re OK with that, no worries, just click the acknowledgement that you understand and are OK with it. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re giving permission; it\u2019s just a concession for convenience\u2019 sake (in other words, they\u2019re not going to sue you as long as they can do the remedy they\u2019ve chosen). NOTE: They can rescind or change this at any time, so it\u2019s always best to get permission on the front end. If they\u2019re stripping out songs altogether or blocking the video because it contains that content, you\u2019ll need to contact that rights owner to request permission to use it\u2026and fair warning: If you\u2019re using entire songs, it\u2019s unlikely. Shorter excerpts on a personal video for a small audience where there\u2019s no profit or loss of sales? Likely. But the copyright owner has complete say in what they\u2019ll permit and how because it\u2019s their property you\u2019re wanting to use. Once you\u2019ve obtained written permission, you can re-upload and then dispute the copyright notification, giving as your justification for the exemption the reason that you have obtained the permission or have a license to use it (usually you have to give enough details that the rights holder can verify this). Another (far better) option is to not use copyrighted music at all. Either produce your own or buy, license, or obtain some royalty-free non-copyrighted music that\u2019s intended for this type of use. One great example of this (which I love and use in many personal videos) is Bensound.com. They have both free and paid licenses depending on how you want to use their work, and on the free ones they usually permit it (license it) as long as you\u2019re willing to follow their terms, which usually means proper acknowledgement/credit and a referral link to their site. Another such service (geared more to professional video producers, but with single-song options and reasonable per-track pricing) is NarratorTracks. Or use music which is licensed through Creative Commons, as Todd Gardiner suggested. ",

            "answer_text": "Do people actually read the question before they answer? This bloke wants to know how he CAN GET PERMISSION TO USE THE MUSIC LEGALLY? So here is what you would need to do but chances are that this will be a frustrating experience: You need permission by the rights owner which is usually the publisher of the music. This is not necessarily the label company that produced the music! You would contact the publisher and ask for procedures to grant you the right to use the music in a YouTube video. But: As most of those guys \u201chave lots to do\u201d, chances are that you will not even receive an answer because they think you are just a private guy with no money to spend. Sad but true. There are also places like the GEMA in Germany who make sure that people get money when their stuff is played in the radio, online, on TV in movies \u2026 wherever. Probably you will be more successful trying to get the rights there. If the stuff you are doing is not commercial work, your chances are not bad to actually get the rights for a reasonable amount of money. Companies like GEMA do have some fair online packages. Not sure how it works in other countries than Germany, though. If all of this does not lead to anywhere: Replace the songs with some royalty free music: There are tons of websites where you can buy awesome music for little money regarding usage rights. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to contact the record label or publisher of the track you would like to use - because you need to acquire the synchronization license from the copyright owner. This could end up in a big amount of money as the copyright owner can ask anything in exchange for the \u201cSYNC\u201d license. An alternative would be to use music from a royalty free music library where composers upload their music and authorise the music libraries to sell those sync license on their behalf. The price for such is license is usually around 30 USD per track and the process is extremely easy and instant. If you are looking for a certain track you may also go for a \u201csound alike\u201d track in royalty free music libraries. It will not cost a fortune and you may end up creating the same feeling as the popular track you intented to use. Another advantage of using music from royalty free music libraries is that in most cases, composers upload different versions of the same track (30sec, 60 sec, full track, full track without lead instrument etc). This may save significant time of track editing. ",

YouTube (and only YouTube) has sync license agreements with 95% of all publishers. So if YOU make a cover version of a song YOU can post that as a performance video or even a concept video on YOUTUBE. They also generally let you post actual artist recordings provided you DON\u2019T use them in original films or videos, but just show the lyrics, or a photo of the artist or the album cover. YouTube also has licenses from ASCAP, BMI and SESAC. ",
