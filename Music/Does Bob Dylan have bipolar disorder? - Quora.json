            "answer_text": "I've never seen any evidence or suggestion that he has.  I think what Bob suffers from is a a case of \"Unwanted Fame Syndrome.\" Bob doesn't really want to be famous.  Some people get into the music industry because they want the fame. They want to be noticed, loved and adored at every opportunity. They try and gain attention wherever possible and attend every event, opening and awards ceremony. They make a bee-line for every camera and their various social media accounts project their fame far and wide. Bob Dylan gives every indication that he doesn't want to be famous at all. He wants to make albums and perform concerts for his fans and then he'd really rather you forgot all about him in between.He had more than his fill of fame when he was an icon in the sixties and people were breaking into his house and going through his rubbish and following him everywhere. Now he just wants a normal kind of life which lets him do what he loves. He seems to crave a level of anonymity that he will never, ever be able to have.  Bob might come across as suffering from bi-polar disorder or another diagnosable condition because he doesn't behave like a famous person. He doesn't even behave like a normal person (most normal people would love to be famous), he behaves like someone who hates fame and everything associated with it. That's such an abnormal attitude in today's \"Notice Me!\" world of social media that we instantly assume there must be something wrong with him. There isn't anything wrong with him, he's experienced fame, he's seen it tip over into obsession and he doesn't want anything to do with it. He just wants to make and play music.    ",
