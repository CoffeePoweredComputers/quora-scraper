            "answer_text": "Depends on the school and the student. If the person who the laptop\u2019s intended for is adept at touch typing, I would go with a 13\u2033 screen for most people (as they are lighter weight and easier to carry around). If not, a 15\u2033 might be better option. Also, if they are in a dorm room or share the apartment, there\u2019s a chance they will be cramming through the night. A backlit keyboard is really invaluable on such occasion. Watch the weight. They will be taking that thing with them everywhere, the lighter the machine is, the better. But don\u2019t go the ultrabook route, you don\u2019t want to buy your student something that is a potential thief magnet and too expensive to replace. Also, students don\u2019t tend to be too careful with their tech, someone might easily use it as a drink coaster and destroy it. Also, be mindful of the battery. Short battery life can make a machine way less usable. As for the hardware, I would strongly suggest at the very least 8GB of ram (preferably 16) and an SSD, as in 2020 anything without these 2 components is way too sluggish. As for the screen, except for the size, I do think that today 1080p should be in every laptop. Also, I would like to see the IPS panel (HP calls that a UVWA), as the viewing angles are way better than on cheaper TN panels. There will be way less head tilting and neck pain. If the student is an engineering student though, I would probably forget the whole weight thing and go for a gaming laptop. Those things are big and heavy with bad batteries and they do look tacky, but they will provide the most power for the smallest financial outlay. They do come with powerful processors, upgradeable ram, graphics cards that can speed up almost any kind of rendering. They will never be as powerful as a full blown workstation laptops, but they will be plenty powerful for the studies and cost way, way, way less. If it\u2019s a design school, I would go with the best possible screen I could afford, something with calibration certification if financially possible. That way, you\u2019ll know you\u2019re getting accurate colors. But you don\u2019t necessarily have to go over the top expensive, it\u2019s still a school, not a professional studio. Now, if it\u2019s a high school student, I would probably simply go with a gaming laptop if I could afford it and be done with it, your kid will probably be happiest with that one. Or whatever I could afford. ",

            "answer_text": "In the current world, one of the most necessary items for any college student is a decent laptop which can support a multitude of all-nighters throughout the entire course. We are expected to write our papers and dissertations on it and our study materials are expected to be in it as well. It is however difficult to find the laptop that would suit your requirements without burning a hole in your pocket. I have been there. I will list a few of the laptops that I think might suit the needs of a student in 2020. Acer Aspire E5 Acer has always been a reliable brand when it comes to laptops. The Acer Aspire E5 retails for around 24k which is a very decent price tag for a student. It also comes with pretty good features which will be able to support intense study sessions smoothly.  Specifications of the Acer Aspire E5 It has a 15.60-inch display size.The resolution of the display is 1366 * 768 pixelsThe processor is Core i5It has 4 GB RAMWindows 10 Home Operating systemThe hard disk has 1 TB internal storageIt does not have an SSD Card slot and does not support touchscreen as well.The Graphics are Nvedia GForce 940 MXIt weighs 2.20 kg.One of the best parts about this laptop is the 1TB internal storage. That is ample storage space and you won\u2019t need to carry around an external hard disk as well. I also like that the processor is 5th generation. Dell Vostro I have personally always loved Dell laptops. I used a Dell Inspiron 15 a few years back and it was really a good experience. I still have it to this day and still use it. Dell Vostro is another budget oriented laptop which retails for around 20,190rs. It is really good price for a laptop, I mean smartphones are more expensive than this at the moment.  Specifications of the Dell Vostro It has a 15.60-inch display size.The resolution of the display is 1366 * 768 pixelsThe processor is Celeron Dual CoreIt has 4 GB RAMDOS Operating systemThe hard disk has 500 GB internal storageIt does not have an SSD Card slot and does not support touchscreen as well.It weighs 2.50 kg.This is another good example of a decent and reliable laptop. It also comes with ample internal storage and a decent RAM. HP 250 G5 HP released a budget range laptop which retails for around 21k with reliable features.  Specifications of the HP 250 G5 It has a 15.60-inch display size.The processor is Core i3It has 8 GB RAMWindows 10 Operating systemThe hard disk has 1 TB internal storageIt does not have an SSD Card slot and does not support touchscreen as well.These are a few choices that I am able to provide for budget laptops. I think that nowadays any laptop within 25k will do the required functions for you especially if you are a student. All of these options have a good RAM and ample internal storage along with a good OS as well. (Source : GadgetsNDTV) (Source : GadgetsNDTV) ",
