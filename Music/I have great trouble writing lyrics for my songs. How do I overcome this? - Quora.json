            "answer_text": "How to Build a Song/Write a Lyrics Poem From Scratch 1. What to write about Think of something or someone that inspires you Something or someone that bothers you Something or someone that changed your life A person you admire A childhood or travel memory A small incident in a moment that reversed itself in your life Any subject it seems no one talks about 2. How to write it Pick a melody in your head or a catch phrase that you like, and just flesh it out. You can change any song idea after getting stuck for some other new angle or different idea. Don't stay stuck long. Use your journal. Catch ideas that don't yet fit for later. Use a rhyming dictionary, thesarus (directory of concepts!) or some creativity exercise. Oh yeah....keep doing it. Someone once said \"there's no such thing as a genius, just someone who practiced 100,000 times\". 3. Format for familiarity People often write lyrics as poetry, but fight the usual rhyming and formatting most popular songs use. It's your choice, but it also depends heavily on whether your target audience is going to \"get\" your work if you get away from a standard AABA format with a solid chorus and hook, or whether the object is to try new creative or innovative ideas. In the end, you decide how and what to tell the world. Personally, I believe in choruses, familiar rock/country/blues formats and whatever gets your audience to sing along. Usually, less is more, and repeating a key line once or twice makes a point stand out. 4. Standing on the shoulders of giants Someone somewhere blew you away with a song or two. What was it about that song that you liked? Would you like to try and make a song that blows people away like that too? Emulate your idols without copying, or be inspired by a song you just heard on the radio. Believe in what you're doing. The only thing the greats (Dylan, Lennon, etc.) had in common was the belief that they could change the world by doing what they did. They were right. 5. Exhibit A This song has no music yet, so feel free to co-write it with me. Now That I\u2019m Ready For Love Another year wiser, another year older Another day empty, another night colder Another squandered opportunity But now that I\u2019m ready for love, no one\u2019s ready for me I sift through these streets, filled with aimless dancers In calm desperation, still searching for answers Leaves green and inviting, new rings on the tree But now that I\u2019m ready for love, no one\u2019s ready for me Young maidens sense some hot wave of emergency They marry and mate in a false sense of urgency As the hurried home crumbles, the fingers point blames And all hold back burned hearts as they re-alter names Never considering a cause holding true That someone like me could want someone like you That someone like me could need someone like you That someone like me could love someone like you INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE Another year wiser, another year older Another day empty, another night colder Another squandered opportunity But now that you\u2019re ready for love, are you ready for me? Ready for me? Really ready for me? Now that you\u2019re ready for love, are you ready for me.... Laughing Dolphin Music ",

            "answer_text": "When I get writer\u2019s block with lyrics, I harken back to my favorite poet, Robert Frost. A person once asked Robert Frost, \u201cHow do you write a poem?\u201d \u201cI can tell you how,\u201d Robert replied. I don\u2019t remember his exact words but I do remember his intent. This is a paraphrased version. Here goes! Wait until something special happens! Then jot down every nuance of the event. Write down the time of day, the feel of the wind, the color of the sky, the sound of laughter or sorrow, the sound of voices, and the whisper of the pines. Shout at thunder and revel in the rain. Watch cats and dogs frolic. Bring out the mood of every moment. When you have a great list in front of you, ride the words until your poem is complete. That is what I got out of Robert Frost\u2019s response. When I write lyrics and I get stuck I use the influence of Robert Frost. One of my personal techniques for writing lyrics is to write one sentence that defines the theme of the song. From that one sentence, I write four separate sentences that pertain to the subject at hand. I turn each sentence into a paragraph and I shift from prose to poetry as needed for the lyrics. When the four paragraphs are set right, I cook up the chorus sections. The chorus sections are set after the paragraphs, sometimes after one or two paragraphs. Keep in mind that the meter of the lyrics can be extended by allowing certain words or phrases to extend a lyric. You can stretch out a catchy word or phrase instead of keeping the phrases as you originally wrote them. Play with this concept and you will bring more life into your tunes. When in doubt, experiment. When your lyrics are ready to roll. Take the time to speak the lyrics as you would a sentence. This technique can create the rhythm of the lyrics, and when you have the rhythm of the lyrics, you have the basis for your melody. That\u2019s when you go for the vocals. You can also determine whether the lyrics lead to the first measure or whether they start in the first measure. The start placement for the intro lines is an important factor so give it due time to find its place. Ride the words and music until you have your song! This always works for me! ",
