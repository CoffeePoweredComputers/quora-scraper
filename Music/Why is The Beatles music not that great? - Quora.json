            "answer_text": "I might be wrong. However I believe a few people may have misunderstood what the writer ment. The Beatles were and will always be kings of their art. However we also must remember when they recorded their music and the technology of the equipment available to them at the time they recorded their albums and the style of engineering of the time. Abbey road studio was still wearing white coats in the studio. Everything was by the book written by people that recorded with wax not too long before the Beatles came along. The Beatles recorded on 2-track tape machines with I believe 2 1/2 wide tape. which probably why during the remastering of their most recent album releases produced by Giles. He was able to make them sound modern by today\u2019s standard. However during their time. The Beatles records were standards. Listen to other British bands of the time. I listened to the Pete Best combo and the Yardbirds. and found the sound to be harsh to the ears. But that was the standard of the time. By the time they began recording with 4-track recorder, or sync\u2019d to a 2nd 4-track like in Sgt. Pepper, recording technique had grown. Placing mic\u2019s closer to the amps. Closer to the drums. Recording the bass guitar direct to the board onto its own track. Stuff that was \u201cjust not done\u201d at the time. And their engineers were getting called to the head office. And then to hi-jack the brand new 8-track to begin recording \u201cAbbey road\u201d. The sound of that album alone is high and above their first album in sound Superiority. . Lennon him self said their earlier albums sounded like crap and wanted to record many of their songs over again. So to answer the question as to why the Beatles music doesn\u2019t sound good. well. Take your phone. Which is still light years ahead of what they had. And record 14 songs. then grab you computer with all today\u2019s modern plug in\u2019s and record the same songs. Then you tell me. why does your music suck. and remember. They recorded together live. No computers. No effects. No pro-tools. I can tell you this. You\u2019ll suck. mahalo ",

            "answer_text": "No one can answer this question for you but yourself. It\u2019s completely subjective. There is no good or bad music, and only you can decide what is or isn\u2019t great for you, and why. Why do you think The Beatles\u2019 music isn\u2019t that great? I\u2019m sure you have your reasons for thinking that. They\u2019ll be different from the reasons of other people who think their music isn\u2019t that great. Since we\u2019re talking The Beatles, this question is full of answers trying to prove you \u201cwrong,\u201d and that they are great. As expected. Like them or not, they\u2019re probably the most famous band of all time, which obviously means they have a LOT of fans. And fans (of anything) like to think their favourite is the best. Most famous doesn\u2019t necessarily mean best though- there is no \u201cobjective best band of all time\u201d and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. I love The Beatles. I don\u2019t think their music is \u201cnot that great,\u201d but I can\u2019t expect everyone to share that opinion. However, the way you worded the question makes me think you\u2019re looking for an objective answer to this question- I\u2019m sorry to tell you that you\u2019re not going to find one by asking other people. Everyone\u2019s opinion on The Beatles (or any artist) is slightly different, and they\u2019re just going to answer with what\u2019s true to them rather than to you. Stick with the answer that\u2019s true to you- it\u2019s YOUR right answer and, love or hate The Beatles, you can only be right in regards to a subjective art form like music. ",
