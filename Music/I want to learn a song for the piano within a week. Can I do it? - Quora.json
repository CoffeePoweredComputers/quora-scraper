            "answer_text": "This is an extremely broad question, because it all depends. If I practiced a difficult song for a minute every day, of course I am not going to master it. Now, if I practice that song (or even an easier song) for 15 minutes or more, there is a higher chance. Another thing to keep in mind is the length of the song, how well you know it (when you listen to it are you familiar with what is coming next\u2026 in other words, have you memorized the song in your head?), what resrouces you\u2019re using to learn it (lessons? sheet music? videos? picking it out by ear?), how long it usually takes you to master certian songs, your skill level, how long you\u2019re willing to practice, etc. Ask yourself all of these questions, then step back and analyze the situation. If you feel like you can maybe do it, give it a try. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? Although, if you\u2019re playing this song for a performance and you\u2019re doubtful that you\u2019ll be able to play it, you may want to consider choosing another song or talking to your teacher/band conductor. You definetley do not want to go on stage if you\u2019re not confident, comfortable, and/or fully prepared. Good luck! ",
