            "answer_text": "Yes, they were technically proficient (except for Ozzy, who had no training as a singer). One of the things that people miss when talking about Black Sabbath is their technical proficiency. Such has been their impact on music, that we forget that they had 3 excellent instrument players in their ranks: 1) Toni Iommi: Everyone knows him as the one of the best riff masters of all time, who turned the Gibson SG into the instrument of choice for metal music. Considering his limitations with his fingertips, his solos are extremely good. Not the most technical but still better than what most guitarists have put out in their entire careers. For example, check out his solos on War Pigs, Paranoid, Into the Void, Wheels of Confusion, Under the Sun \u2026 and those are just the first 4 albums. His soloing diversified on the Heaven and Hell album (esp. the title track and Lonely is the Word) and on the albums after that, where he experimented with major scale and jazz based solos, with more use of the delay effect. 2) Bill Ward: Very underrated and I disagree with anyone who says that he was not a technically proficient drummer. He was trained as a jazz drummer and one can clearly see his jazz influences in several Black Sabbath songs. However, it was his high-energy, almost tribal style of drumming that became synonymous with heavy metal drumming. 3) Geezer Butler: His influence on heavy metal is unquestionable as is his technical proficiency and innovative style. He was one of the first bass players to use a wah pedal and downtune a bass guitar to C# tuning to match Iommi\u2019s guitar tuning. When you are the inspiration for Steve Harris of Iron Maiden (usually considered one of the finest bass players of all time), you know you are good !!! ",

            "answer_text": "Back in the 80s, when I was in college I remember a professor saying \u201canyone can learn grammar, not everyone can learn to write\u201d. Why is that important? It applies to music also. You read books because the story grabs you. You get interested in the story. You don\u2019t get caught up in the number of complex, compound sentences. Nobody says \u201cthis novel is great, there are absolutely no misspellings or comma splices! Best novel ever!!\u201d The story. That\u2019s the point of writing. You tell a story. An uninteresting story is uninteresting, even if it is written well. If you practice long enough, you can become a proficient musician. You can practice your entire life, be a proficient musician, and not learn to write a song. You listen to music because the song grabs you. It moves you. It creates feelings in you. A basic song can rock! You don\u2019t have to be some kind of virtuoso to write a great song. So, who really cares how technically proficient and complex music is? Uninteresting technically proficient music is uninteresting. Me? I love Sabbath. Tony Iommi? Have you read about his accident and how he overcame it? Interesting. Sabbath songs talk to me. They move me. I don\u2019t really care about the technical aspects of the song. NIB? Yes please. Thy this. Have a random person name a Sabbath song. Now ask the same person to name a Joe Satriani song. I bet almost everyone knows a Sabbath song and far fewer know Satriani. Why? Sabbath rocks and Satriani, while technically superior to Sabbath, just does not tell as good a story ",
