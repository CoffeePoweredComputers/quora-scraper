            "answer_text": "It depends on the instrument. I was a trombonist, so any symphony or anywhere that does Dixieland. As keyboard, drummer or guitar/bass player, you can work anywhere. Military towns usually have a lot of bars with live music, but it\u2019s mostly cover work. Being an aspiring guitar player in a C&W town like Nashville means lots of competition. As a jazzer, NY and LA are the hot spots. What you do is take lessons from a heavy. When he or she gets double-booked, if you\u2019re good enough, you may get a chance. Always play where you have to play over your head. This forces you to grow into a monster player. Join the musicians\u2019 union - AFM. In LA, they used to have a job board and I expect that they still do. You could find a lot of things that are really scary, like a tour to some war-torn country, but sometimes one thing leads to another. When a group tours and some members have studio gigs, nobody wants leave town. That\u2019s when you get a shot. In LA, there are rehearsals going on a lot all day and guys don\u2019t show up. You make your presence known and sometimes you get called. The bands that played elsewhere in back rooms at night were usually old guys who never progressed beyond college or high school. It was just higher, louder, faster. No gigs. You\u2019re playing for sophistication and detailed work. These are not your people. In my experience, it took at least 6 months to get known in a new city. I remember when I first got to LA, I hung out at the union during the day and I got called. We all traded business cards because nobody knows who you are and they\u2019re very polite. It\u2019s not like the back-biting at college. You could be source of these guys\u2019 next gig. I remember sitting in with a band and the guy next to me hands me his card first. Damn! I studied this guy\u2019s book and he has albums out. Wow! I remember being invited to be backstage at a Miles Davis concert. It was so loose that I could have walked on stage and played. If Miles had liked me, he wouldn\u2019t have thrown me off. I was too scared. It seems that most of the guys that I went to school with went to NY and ended up on SNL or with major jazz bands. One of my friends at North Texas used to play the Arban\u2019s Bass book at really high speeds. He ended up with Toto. Not jazz, but not starving. Then he had the bucks and freedom to do whatever he wanted. When you\u2019re starting out, take anything, even if it\u2019s free, just to get known. I found that even when I was off the horn for a while, being able listen to great players caused my own ideas to grow. It was a sub-conscious thing. Hear everybody that you can afford. ",

            "answer_text": "There are of course a lot of musicians in cities like New York, Boston, Los Angeles, and Chicago. However, the city that provides the best opportunity for you personally is the one where you have the greatest opportunity to perform frequently. And this could be anywhere. Not that you should stay in a smaller town forever, but if you have an in with a club/restaurant/teaching opportunity or working band in a smaller pond where you're a relatively large fish that\u2019s allowing you to a) grow musically and 2) play paid gigs several times a week, it's probably worth swimming there for a while. You just have to be honest with yourself about when that place has become too comfortable; by then you've hopefully gained a toehold you can stand on in a larger city. ",
