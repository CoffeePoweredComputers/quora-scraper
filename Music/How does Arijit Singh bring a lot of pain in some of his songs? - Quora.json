            "answer_text": "My opinions expressed may not be very amenable/digestible to many of the younger generation who reveres/adores him in awe\u2026 That said, as a wonderful 'musician' he comes out very down-to-earth and humble, a trait he has genetically been bestowed or accomodated to cater to Bollywood hoi-polloi\u2026 I, personally am not a great fan of this singer, because of either the music directors in question have molded/forced him to sing in a particular movement, which grates one's ears over time. Every song of his sounds 95% the same! Secondly, despite the fact that he has created his own, individual style, he sounds more constipated than rendering the lyrics the right way. The same goes with Atif too. He has a higher timbre in his voice, and therefore can reach higher octaves, but again the output is monotonous. My comments are NOT to deride anyone, but the charm of listening to Kishore Da, Manna Da, or Rafi saheb is totally lost. My humble apologies to everyone in rhe group, if I have inadvertently offended anyone. Yes, I belong to the older generation and the lyrics, composition, and rendition of a work that enhances a composer's work has stood the test of time and it will\u2026Muse about remixes, and why Pancham Da still rules the world and across all gobal frontiers\u2026 The new crop are like comets\u2026they whizz past with a Wow! but immediately erased from memory. I am not expecting any up/down votes with my opinions, but just to clarify that my comments are just my 2 cents\u2026 ",
