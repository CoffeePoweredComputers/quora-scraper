            "answer_text": "The story goes he had an affair with his then manager and she hit him for speaking to her via phone while they were driving to an award show. To avoid crashing, he pulled over. Then got out of the car and chased her down as she ran from him. Catches her, assaults her, drives around without her, then turns himself in. Apparently they soon after went on a trip together, after which she gave the famous oprah interview. In my personal opinion regardless of the reported circumstances his behavior cannot he excused. ",

He beat her up because she spit in his face in which doesn\u2019t justify his actions. The combination of alcohol and insecurity peaked. She is also guilty, because at some point she could have removed herself. He is guilty because no man has any right to put his hands on a woman not matter what the circumstances. This incident wasn\u2019t their first rodeo. ",
