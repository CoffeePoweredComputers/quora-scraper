I do not know if he has any finacial stakes involved with them because no one actually knows where BTS money comes from or how much they are actually worth because NONE of them have said so from their mouths (a lot of guesses or estimations). To answer this question\u2026Naver started V Live back in 2015 (I think that is the correct year off the top of my head, I just use the app and it states Naver V Live) ",

(LOL ) But it is not like this. V Live (sometimes stylized as VLIVE) is a South Korean live video streaming service that allows Korean-based celebrities to broadcast live videos on the internet and live chat with fans from around the globe.
