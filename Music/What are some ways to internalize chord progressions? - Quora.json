You need to hear them and play them repeatedly. If you haven\u2019t already, you also need to move from thinking of a Dm7-G7-C sequence as a ii7-V7-I sequence. This will allow you to see that the sound of the progression is not limited to those specific chords. Rather, the sound is (largely) dependent on the function of those chords, which is indicated by the numbers. That is necessary. But if you want to supplement your practice, assign a meaning to the progressions: if you can attach emotion to the meaning, so much the better. Psychs call this \u201celaborative rehearsal.\u201d This meaning needs to be personal. My meaning might not work for you. For example, I try to be conscious of feeling the \u201cheading out\u201d tension and the \u201ccoming home\u201d resolution of progressions. I also take the tension of a chord, and look at it as if someone were expressing an idea. For example, a two-five sequence (or extended three-six-two-five) is seeing your house in the distance as you come home.moving to an unexpected chord is a new idea, as in \u201cnow on the other hand \u2026\u201dother signpost words or phrases that echo the path of a progression that come to mind are:for examplein additionbutnow wait a minuteThis more relates to jazz improvisation, but it might help. A few years ago, I had the good fortune to see the Marsalis family perform. While everyone on stage was a monster player, Wynton was \u2026 different. His solo sounded like a soliloquy, a conversation with himself, or expressive poetry. When I imagine myself expressing ideas through the horn, as if I were in a one-hander play (or playing a madman talking to himself!) I get very interesting solos. Hope that helps. ",
