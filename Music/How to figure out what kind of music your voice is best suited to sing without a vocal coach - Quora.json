            "answer_text": "Well, without a vocal coach it can be fairly difficult-but I guess I'd go by the following guides: How do people think you sound when you sing certain music? By this, I mean some voices are built for belting, some voices are more operatic/legit by nature-they sound better with music that doesn't require a heavy belt sound. If you try to sing pop music that requires a heavy sound/belt, but your voice sounds light, you may not be able to sing that kind of music-at least not without some training. But even with training, different voice types simply do certain music better than others. How do you feel after you sing certain music? If you are trying to  belt, do you feel hoarse or sore after singing? You may not be suited for that type of music if you are hoarse or sore-singing should never hurt. Are you sore or tired after singing music with a lot of high notes or low notes? Again, that's an indicator that that type of music may not be right for you. If you sing high notes easily, look for music with that. If you don't, look for music with a range that is comfortable for you. Again, proper technique is critical to being able to sing without discomfort and with proper training you can learn to sing with comfort-one can even train to belt without killing your voice- but if you aren't going to get that training, then know that pain and hoarseness is NOT healthy, and that until you learn to sing properly, stick to music that doesn't cause you pain or discomfort. What do YOU like? Are you a person who likes fast songs to sing? Or do you prefer ballads/slow songs? Some voices sound better singing ballads-this is true if you have a rich, resonant tone. Some voices do very well with faster music-their voices are built to move faster, and your tone quality isn't as important as it would be if you chose mostly ballads (but it is still important though-people have to find your voice appealing no matter what you sing).  Of course, your repertoire should contain a mix of music types, especially if you are looking to make a career out of singing-you should be as flexible as you can to be able to take advantage of more opportunities. A vocal coach can help you expand your horizons, both through picking out music for you and training you so that you can sing other music as well. How easy is it for you to learn music? If you pick up the music quickly, and can learn to sing tricky melodies relatively quickly with accuracy, then you can try genres that use tricky and/or complex harmonies or arrangements like jazz or have complex melodies, such as opera/classical. How loud are you? If people are always telling you to pipe down, you have a large voice-and that's a good thing. You can pursue music that requires power-such as opera, rock, and the like. However, know that without proper technique, you will not sound optimal, and you could hurt yourself, especially with opera and rock. However, this self analysis will only take you so far. A vocal coach can not only tell you what you are suited for at your present level, they can train you to bring out your true vocal quality and teach you technique that will enable you to sing without pain-and once they do that, that can open up more types of music that you can sing.

And don\u2019t forget to get the opinion of others! Our recorded voice is how most people perceive it - we hear our voice much differently. So the opinions of other people are very important to determine which kinds of music is best suited to your voice. Also take note: some voices fit very specific styles of music. You might think that once you are able to sing one kind of song, you\u2019d be able to sing a similar song. Some voices aren\u2019t like that. I know of someone who\u2019s a really good R&B singer, but he can\u2019t sing them all. Mind you, this is in the same vocal range and same style. But his execution isn\u2019t suited to all the songs even in the same style. It\u2019s just that way. Sometimes it\u2019s specific the other way around! I know of another guy who can do ballads and heavy metal growling stuff, but his voice sucks at regular 90s boyband pop! So, try them all, explore, sing the songs you think you can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t and you might be surprised with what you discover! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, first you need a device to record yourself on. And brace yourself for a nasty shock: what you hear of your own voice is much amplified and enhanced by your own body, it is not what others hear, and what YOU hear is much, much better than what others hear. JFTR, It took me two years to get used to mine. Voice is the most difficult instrument to learn and train because not two are the same and you don\u2019t even see it. You have to go by feel. If you really dislike the voice you hear on the recorder, then it\u2019s up to you to place the sound differently in your mouth until you hear an improvement. Apart from providing you with tips and mental images on how to achieve this, a voice coach could give you breathing exercises and vocalises that would allow you to train your voice like a muscle and protect your vocal cords from ill use and consequent injury. Once you find the sound of your voice bearable, choosing repertoire is pretty much a matter of matching your vocal capacities with your preferences. Choose something you like, but which feels comfortable singing and sounds good in your voice. ",

There's not much point in singing what you don't like, you won't be able to connect as well with the music (unless you're a pro or just really good, then you can find a way).  Then, go find people to sing in front of. Ask your friends.  Go to a karaoke place and get their opinions.  Step up at a bar.  Find family members and ask them.  Record yourself singing something and put it on YouTube.  (Get permission from the artists and songwriters/publishers, but most won't care about your copyright infringement just to check if you're any good at it)  (or share it privately with friends and family and it won't be an infringement). They may not have a professional answer, but people have ears.  They can help judge you if you are not capable of at least partially objectively judging yourself. ",

Some voices in one genre, like rock, are suitable for others like blues, but not for jazz. Good for bossa nova, not good for punk, and so on. Some talented vocalists can adapt to multiple styles, too, depending on the situation. They can mimic the nuances of vocal delivery and suot the style. So experiment, record, listen, and go for it! I've sng and fronted three bamds which play rock, jazz, funk, and blues and some styles are more comfortable than others. Get out there and sing! Then get out there and listen!! ",

Record yourself singing, and listen to it. Pick it apart. Fix what you don't like. Rinse and repeat. And then decide what sounds good to you. ",

For example, you could hire a vocal coach for just 1 hour and they should be able to give you suggestions on what material would suit your voice, which songs would be ideal for auditions, etc. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to take a lot of trial and error. You could probably work it out; but a tutor will help you to get there quicker. ",

A vocal coach is someone who helps you get your role or songs from what you think is ready to actually performance ready. They may suggest different phrasing or dynamics or correct your diction. They are not voice teachers. They are either conductors or pianists. They don\u2019t suggest repertoire. You tell them what you\u2019ve been hired to do and they help you get it amazing. ",
