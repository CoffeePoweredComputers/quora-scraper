            "answer_text": "It is more likely that you may feel a sense of guilt after eating, not necessarily deep sadness - which is depression. If you are having other symptoms - such as lack of appetite/overeating, insomnia, loss of pleasure and/or a deep sadness - it is always a good idea to contact a doctor and get a proper assessment and diagnosis. Now, if we are speaking about feeling guilty after eating: If we were to do a retrospective of the way we eat, it would be easy to notice that we don't always eat because we are hungry. There are times when we eat because we get bored, because we are anxious, to get rid of stress or worry, to find comfort or relief or simply to reward ourselves for success. Emotional eating occurs when a person unconsciously uses food not to satisfy their hunger, but to quell or avoid a difficult or unpleasant emotion. When the urge to eat breaks out, you can focus on nothing but food (what to eat, how fast you can get to eat a particular product or feel a certain taste, etc.). Once you have eaten, you remain in the same unpleasant state, to which is added the feeling of guilt that you did not solve anything by eating, but on the contrary, you created a bad physical state because you ate too much. Use conscious eating to give up the urge to eat. Take a break of 5 minutes before giving up and learn to accept your feelings, even the unpleasant ones  If you found this answer helpful, please leave an upvote. ",

            "answer_text": "Because when you eat blood has to travel to your stomach to digest the food. Some of this blood travels from your brain (and everywhere else in your body) which might you temporarily lose some of your cognitive functions. One of the functions of the pre frontal cortex is to balance stimuli from other parts of the brain (such as the amygdala that handles emotions). When you eat you are now feeling these stimuli at full force. It is the same thing as when you are starting to eat and suddenly realise that you are really really hungry. You have actually been hungry for a while but your brain has been actively ignoring the stimuli that tells your brain that you need food. It is important to understand that the change and the depressed mood is temporary. Once your body has processed the food your cognitive functions will return. One good way to lessen the depressed feeling is to eat better (more nutrient at a more regular interval) since your blood glucose level in turn affects your mood. You might feel sad to begin with because you are hungry! Good luck! ",
