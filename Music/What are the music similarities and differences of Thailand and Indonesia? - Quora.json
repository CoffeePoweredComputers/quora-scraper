            "answer_text": "The first thing we must establish is the immense diversity of music within Indonesia alone\u2014the gamelan orchestras of Java and Bali are much more similar to Thailand\u2019s phipat music than it is to, say, sasando music of Rote Island or even Angklung music of the Sunda people (who share an island with the Javanese). So I\u2019m using the description \u2018Indonesian music\u2019 as an umbrella term for the most widely spread traditional and folk music typologies that belong to cultures that happened to fall under Indonesia\u2019s current geopolitical borders. As with many Austronesian cultures, both Thai and Indonesian music feature percussions (non-melodic ones like various forms of drums and melodic ones, usually metallophones like the Indonesian gamelan or Thai ranat). They also both have string instruments like the kecapi in Indonesia or khim in Thailand (though one is plucked and the other is struck). The most striking difference I can think of is Arab influence in more modern versions of Indonesian folk music. Speaking of more modern music, my take is that both Thai and Indonesian music makers have a knack for making sappy and mawkish pop-ballad songs :) ",
