            "answer_text": "Music speaks volumes about a person, and many tend to bond with people with similar music tastes. If people are asking you to listen to their favorite songs, they are judging by your reaction whether or not you are compatible with them. It's part of normal human interaction -- finding a common bond. I like all sorts of music, but if somone like a particular genre (I'm not name it) over something else, I might make a decision that we won't be \"close\" friends, because I can't tolerate their choice of music for long. If music is playing while you are with friends, it evokes pleasant memories (usually). If I can't relate pleasant music to a friendship, I might stay away. ",

That\u2019s the warmest answer, maybe we should just stick with that one, heh heh. But if we\u2019re not giving them the benefit of the doubt, they could be seeking validation from you (bit needy), testing whether you\u2019re cool enough to be with them (sad) or trying to impose their music taste upon you (controlling). End of the day, we each love what we love - a song, a band, a type of food, a person, whatever. We love it. It doesn\u2019t matter one bit if nobody else in the world even *likes* it. ",
