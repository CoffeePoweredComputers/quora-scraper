            "answer_text": "Well, that\u2019s of like asking which horse is the best kind for travel between New York City and Washington DC. There\u2019s probably a correct answer, but you\u2019re kind of asking the wrong question. Many, perhaps most smartphone mics are tiny piezoelectric or MEMS mics, intended primarily for voice. They will likely distort at higher volumes. The best I know of are those in the LG V10 and LG V20, which at least handle audio levels at 120dB,spl and 132db,spl directly. Rather than buy a new smartphone, you have options. You can add an analog mic, a digital mic, or an audio iterface that will let you use any number of standard pro mics.  Most smartphones have external mic inputs, which may allow a higher-fidelity mic to be added. This is on your headphone jack. Most phones today use the CTIA pinout. Older Android and Blackberry may use the OMTP pinout. You can buy mics to plug in here, probably better than your built-in mic, but nothing too professional. One other interesting analog option is the iRig PRE. This is a powered preamplifier that lets you hook any old professional mic to your phone. Not too expensive However, the quality may still be limited by the ADC in your phone. Though with a top notch phone ADC like those in the LG, it\u2019s a real option.  As far as microphones go\u2026 one will never be enough. But you can start with one you\u2019ll still use later on. Pictured is the GLS Audio ES-58, which is a blatent Chinese rip-off of the Shure SM-58. It doesn\u2019t sound exactly like the SM-58, but mostly because it uses more modern magnets, like the sort you find in the Shure Beta series. This is a dynamic mic, which will ok on voice, ok on instruments, good on stage if you ever need that. I own three of these, which run around $30. Cheap. It\u2019s also possible to buy a mic that cost more than my current car. Most are somewhere in-between. As far as digital devices, there are way too many for iOS, that\u2019s easy to find. Android is a bit behind, but any Android phone with Android L can interface to most USB sound devices\u2026 the same thing you use on a PC. You\u2019ll need an OTG (on-the-go) cable to hook up .. see here: Dave Haynie's answer to How can I capture an audio signal from an audio mixer to an Android smartphone? Buying a USB sound module gives you the flexibility of using it on a PC or a phone/tablet.  Another option is a dedicated sound recorder, like the Zoom H4n, which I also own. This has decent-quality built-in mics, the ability to add professional mics externally (including support for phantom power, which you\u2019ll need for any condenser mic you might buy), and built-in 4-track recording.

            "answer_text": "An iPhone. I realize this is a very old question, but I\u2019m answering for anyone coming upon this like I did. There also seem to be very few people who have actually tried this that are answering. The iPhones not only have EXCELLENT built-in microphones, but also come with GarageBand installed. You can record just about anything you\u2019d like with this combo alone and make it sound good enough to release. Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz) recorded an album entirely on an iPad. The microphones that are built into these things are, I would say, as good as the low-range condenser microphones you can buy (and iPhone mics are a form of small diaphragm condenser). They are great for acoustic guitars, some electric, surprisingly good with vocals, and oddly one of the best way to record bass guitar cabs. Combine those recordings with a couple of virtual instruments in GarageBand, spend some time mixing on a pair of decent headphones (or monitors if you have them), and you can get truly good sounding tracks out of it.
