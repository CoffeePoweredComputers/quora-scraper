            "answer_text": "Bus Group usage. In an age of more and more CPU power at disposal there\u2019s a trend to add reverb and delays as insert effects for each channel you want the effect to apply on. Instead keep it simple and clean by adding the reverb and delay on individual bus groups and send the tracks you want to effect to those.Using this method, including perhaps a couple different reverbs on individual bus groups ensures each sound has its own space in the dry world whilst shares reverb and delays space in the effect world. It also ensures to minimise or prevent the smearing of too many reverb and delay tails which can happen when you have too many effects all vying for space of their own inevitably clashing with one another. Contrast Good usage of delay and reverb is about understanding the contrast between wet and dry so keep some sounds dry or drier. Reverb sounds great and it\u2019s natural to want to apply it to everything but doing so you\u2019ll end up with a weak sounding mix. Reverb and delay push sounds to the back of the mix so it\u2019s best used for sounds which work with that. In an electronic track this may be ethereal vocal parts or pads for instance.Dial it in then dial it back Push the send/wet control up so you can hear the reverb/delay have an effect, where it feels (sounds) \u2018good\u2019 then dial that back a couple clicks.Delays and Reverbs are at their best adding depth/width and space to the sound, rather than becoming the sound itself; dialing it back from your initial \u201cthat sounds good\u201d position is usually just enough to give the whole part a bit more breathing space and sit better without losing its effect. Mono Using mono sounds with a stereo reverb can be a great way add space whilst keeping mixes under control. It really feels like added garnish to your sound rather than just a default \u201cit needs reverb\u201d type approach.Don\u2019t be afraid to dial back the reverb width control, nothing creates a busy mix like too many parts vying for the stereo field. What are you wanting your listeners to hear? Effects? Or your sound? Clearly your sound.Cheers Martyn Founder at SOUND7 Master Quality Sound Packs ",

            "answer_text": "Be very choosy about where you use them, and especially the reverb. Indiscriminate use of reverb tends to make mixes really murky and unclear. So I suggest you use subtle, short reverb (under 2 seconds at most) for the \u201croom\u201d sound for drums and instruments, and any very long reverb on one instrument or section, such as strings, brass or choirs, unless your arrangement is very sparse, and you have acoustical space to spare. Don\u2019t push too much complex sound at your listener. It\u2019s your job to lead them to the bits they really need to hear, whether it be a guitar or synth solo, a bassline or a vocal, not to baffle them with audio fog. Otherwise, you can only blame yourself if your listeners aren\u2019t getting the best that you\u2019re trying to give them. ",
