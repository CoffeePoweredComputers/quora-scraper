            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not exactly sure what \u201cmost technical\u201d means in this case, but I can say that I once wrote a paper in college comparing James Joyce\u2019s writing style in a section of Finnegan\u2019s Wake and GZA\u2019s writing style on the track Labels. The passage I used from Joyce is likely the most famous one from the book, in which two washerwomen are talking as they wash clothes in the river. Over the course of their conversation, which is written in dialectic vernacular, the names of hundreds of rivers all over the world come into their speech in a remarkable bit of witty wordplay. While Labels is far shorter, GZA (one of the founding members of the Wu-Tang Clan) does the exact same thing. He writes a track about the dangers of trusting record labels and manages to put the names of more than 40 different ones in the lyrics, often using witty wordplay (for instance, saying that he'll \u201cwarn a brother\u201d instead of saying Warner Brothers directly).  Whatever you mean by \u201cmost technical\u201d, I think any song that can be adequately compared to James Joyce probably qualifies. ",

Do your homework before you just say \u201cRap God\u201d is the most technical rap song. Eminem would say Rakim laid the foundation and is the reason he wrote the hook, \u201cI am whatever you say I am, if I wasn\u2019t then why would I say I am.\u201d* Rakim, many years earlier, wrote \u201cIt\u2019s the R the A to the K - I - M, if it wasn\u2019t then why would I say I am?\u201d Sound familiar Here\u2019s a recent interview with Rakim and Scott Van Pelt (yeah, the dude from Sportscenter). SVP pays homage to the God emcee, Rakim Allah.  *Please note: the hook I am referencing is from The Way I Am, not Rap God ",
