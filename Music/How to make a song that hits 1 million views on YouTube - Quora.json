Honestly, I just thought it\u2019d be really hilarious. like bringing a whoopie cushion to class. So I record myself singing the song using my camera\u2026took about 8 times before I could do it without cracking up\u2026then, I made some photos on photoshop and used moviemaker to put it all together\u2026perhaps the fact that I lucked out at getting a random good thumbnail that youtube automatically chooses for you (there\u2019s 3 thumbnails that you can choose from when you upload a video for free that youtube gives you) Otherwise, I have no clue why else. it\u2019s funny. hehe ",
