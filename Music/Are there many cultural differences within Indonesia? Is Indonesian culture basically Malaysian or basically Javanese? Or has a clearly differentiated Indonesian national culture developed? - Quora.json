            "answer_text": "Neither based on Malaysian nor based on Javanese. I must give you enlightenment to clear your 2 misunderstandings (about Indonesian culture based on Malaysian & based on Javanese). Let\u2019s talk about the first misunderstanding. It\u2019s Indonesian culture brought to Malaysia by their ancestors which were hailed from Indonesia. Yes, Malay race (or called as Melayu, in our language) are vastly spread from Indonesia, Malaysia+Singapore+Brunei, Philippines to Vietnam. That\u2019s why Melayu\u2019s culture product are similarly found in these areas though the name will be different. Back to talking about Malaysia, thousand years ago Nusantara area was including Malaysia & Singapore area. On 6th-10th century Nusantara led by Sriwijay/Sri Vijaya Emperor then on 10th-13th century Nusantara led by Majapahit Emperor. Both Sriwijaya & Majapahit is Indonesian emperor. Sriwijaya was situated in South Sumatera & Majapahit was situated in East Java. That\u2019s why many Malaysian ancestors hailed from Indonesia (from Sumatera & from Java). But since foreign colonialization era Nusantara separated due to different colonial factor: Indonesia colonialized by Dutch while Malaysia+Singapore (Malaya Peninsula) colonialized by British. That makes Nusantara area divided into 2 countries & 2 nations: Indonesia & Malaysia. Because Indonesian is Malaysians ancestors, that\u2019s why they share cultural similarities wirh us. Especially with Indonesians who belong to ethnicities in Sumatera such as Minang (West Sumatera people), Aceh, Melayu in Riau & Melayu in North Sumatera. That\u2019s why Rendang which is originated from West Sumatera found in Malaysia also. (I belong to Minang ethnic and every year for Eid my family cook rendang. Then we surprised when suddenly Malaysian claim to the world that rendang is theirs.) I don\u2019t know whether when they claim Batik as theirs the reason also similar or not. But because of lack of cultural promotion from Indonesian government, the rest of the world believe in anything Malaysian claim as their culture product & later we struggle to claim it back from international public understanding. Thank God UNESCO has proved Batik as ours. But the rest, I don\u2019t know. Now talking about second misconception. Indonesia is one of multicultural country in the world. (Yes, my fellow Indonesians, our beloved country is not the one & only multicultural country in the world as taught in our school time.) Indonesia consists of various ethnics, various race & various religions. (Various ethnics produce various cultural products such as various local languages, various local traditions, etc.) Among of various ethnic there is Javanese ethnic. Based on National Statistic Board data, Javanese ethnic is the largest ethnic in Indonesia. Thanks to Soeharto who only promoted Javanese culture through entire Indonesia while he reigned. Their significance added into international because almost every President of Indonesia belong to Javanese ethnic. (Only BJ Habibie is non-Javanese President, he is hailed from South Sulawesi/Celebes). The truth is Indonesian culture is not based on any ethnic. Though Bahasa Indonesia is indeed rooted from Melayu language. But it doesn\u2019t mean our culture based on Melayu only. It\u2019s because of our native diversity culture, Indonesia is exist. Honesty speaking, culture from every native ethnic in Indonesia represent Indonesia. It\u2019s wrong to pick only one ethnic culture from many ethnic culture to represent Indonesia, just like Soeharto did in New Order (Orde Baru). But there is a value that we consider as our culture since it\u2019s exist in every ethnic in Indonesia. The value is gotong royong culture. Gotong royong simply translated as cooperation, working together & helping each other in every situation. I can be right or wrong to say this but I believe this value is our plus factor from other nations in the world. I humbly thank you for taking interest in our culture. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. No. Yes. I\u2019ll explain it. Thanks to Fikri Kawakibi to mention me to this question. Are there many cultural differences within Indonesia? Yes. Absolutely. That\u2019s what you\u2019d get if you unite an archipelago with thousands of islands within its range. Each island was previously separated from each other so each inhabitants developed their distinct cultures not found in other islands. Moreover, many of these islands have cultural variations of their own. Even minor islands like Bangka has at least 12 languages spoken across the island. So yeah, Indonesia is diverse in cultural variation. Is Indonesian culture basically Malaysian or basically Javanese? Not one of these question is true. \u201cMalaysian\u201d is an adjective for everything related to or within the state of Malaysia. Indonesia is a different state from Malaysia so saying that Indonesian culture is basically Malaysian is not only insulting to Indonesian but also to Malaysian as well. Just like Indonesia, Malaysia is not a homogenous country. In Malaysian Peninsula alone, every state has its own distinct culture not found in other states. Johorese are not the same with Kelantanese, and also with N9ers or Malaccans. The only thing that they are called as \u201cMalaysian\u201d is because they live in one country named \u201cMalaysia\u201d. So, is Indonesian culture basically Javanese? Again, there\u2019s no single culture defining what is \u201cIndonesian culture\u201d. It might be valid for homogenous countries such as Japan and Korea, but not Indonesia. Heck, even \u201cJavanese\u201d is not homogenous. Cirebonese are not the same with Yogyakartan, who are in turn not similar with neighboring Surakartan. Don\u2019t even bother to bring in Tegalan and Surabayan in the equation. No, there\u2019s no single representative for Indonesian culture. However, being united under one country for at least 72 years, many ethnicities and cultures across the country have developed a convergence trend towards integration. Integration to what? To each other. Our founding fathers realized that there was no single defining cause to unite the archipelago other than simply being colonized by the Dutch in the past. So, to unite the vast numbers of identities, our founding fathers encouraged Indonesian to embrace a new identity: Indonesian. Bhinneka Tunggal Ika stands for Unity in Diversity, which tells us that no matter how different Indonesians are, they are still one nation: Indonesian. If you have a Malay Malaysian, a Malay Indonesian, a Papuan Indonesian and a Papuan New Guinean, you\u2019ll see that a Malay Indonesian has more things in common with a Papuan Indonesian than to a Malay Malaysian. Similarly you can see that a Papuan Indonesian has more things in common to a Malay Indonesian than to a Papuan New Guinean. Hope that helps. ",

Even in one provice, there could be cultural differences. I\u2019m not talking about the difference between each of the families living there, but the general population. For example, North Sumatra. There are at least seven sub-ethnic groups of Batak which has their own languages, cultures and dialects. Not to mention the Chinese-Indonesians, the Indian-Indonesians, the Malays, the Javanese, living there. Even in Java, where all the big cities are basically neighbors, Tangerang-Jakarta(45min-1.5hr), Jakarta- Bogor and Depok (45 min-1 hr), Jakarta-Bekasi (1 hr), Jakarta-Bandung (2.5\u20134hr). Even Surabaya\u2019s only 13hrs away from home. We\u2019re talking about land transportation, oaky. That\u2019s pretty close. But you can already tell the differences of culture maybe even between two neighboring provinces like DKI Jakarta and West Java. So, that shows how diverse we are, and how Indonesia\u2019s not only Java. For our cultural relationship with Malaysia, yes, we do have some shared culture. Even I can understand 50% of their language (Malay) without any special training, and they can understand standard Indonesian also. ",
