            "answer_text": "The main one is that an anthology book exists, an anthology of books doesn\u2019t.An anthology is a collection of writings, being them prose or poetry, with a common factor: an anthology on music will have writings from different authors that will involve music in a way or the other, at the same time an anthology on H.P. Lovecraft will have excerpts from only his writings, or other authors that knew him and talk about him and his works.Being a collection of excerpts, as single short poems, or single chapters from various books, or again a collection of short stories, you can understand the word itself precludes the possibility of an \u201canthology of books\u201d existing.Maybe you got confused with the word \u201cbibliography\u201d, that indicated a collection of books from the same author (i.e. all the books wrote by Stephen King) or of the same genre, or about the same topic.
