            "answer_text": "Isn't it amazing how the overwhelming majority of people love the lie? A reason they love the lie is that they want to believe that they can have a life past this one and live by their own standard. It's absurd when you think about it that a goofball could give events themselves that they can live by whatever standard they want and then The Giver of life continues their life after this. There's another dude who answered this question he says he\u2019s ahead of physics. He very well might be. We had 9200 views and like a vast amount of likes and writes an answer that has absolutely no validation behind it. But again, most love the lie. Anyway, here is the proper answer. The soul is the individual, and the spirit is the force that gives the individual life. Meditate on how simple that was! Unbelievable, huh? Interestingly, when you read other responses (unless they're from members of my family) they'll typically be very confusing. Why? It's because the ONLY way a person can get everlasting life is to come to an exact knowledge of Jehovah God and be obedient to his Son, Jesus Christ. (John 17:3) (2 Thessalonians1:8,9) Satan, the current ruler of this world (1 John 5:19), (2 Corinthians 4:4), (John 12:31) confuses people about this issue and many others. The first lie ever told here on the Earth was when he told Eve she wouldn't die from eating from the tree in the middle of the garden. Jehovah said she would. (Genesis 3:1-5.) That sin passed on to all of Adam and Eve\u2019s progeny, which is why we all get sick and die. (Romans 5:12) When Jehovah created Adam he formed him from the dust, blew breath into him and Adam BECAME a living soul. (Genesis 2:7) The Bible refers to animals as souls. Jehovah is the source of all life. (Psalms 36:9.) A soul can not exist unless he gives the soul the spark of life or putting his spirit on that life. So when the sperm hits the egg, Jehovah gives it his spirit if he wants to turn that life on. When an individual dies, that person\u2019s soul dies. (Ezekiel 18,4,20) says \u201cthe soul that sins die\u201d. We're all sinners, so we all die. (Romans 5:12.) When the soul, the person dies, the spirit returns to Jehovah. The person has no consciousness. They can do nothing in the grave. (Psalms 146:4) (Ecclesiastes 9:5,10) The human has the same eventuality as the animal. (Ecclesiastes 3:19.) They go to the same place, nothingness. The hope for the dead is the resurrection. (Acts 24:15) (John 5:28,29.) That's a different question. So again, the soul is the individual. The spirit is the life force that comes from Jehovah at inception and goes back to Him at death. ",

            "answer_text": "Your soul is nothing more than everything you can observe within you: your feelings, sensations, thoughts and imagination. Soul is nothing more and nothing less than that. Where people go wrong is by imagining \u201ca soul\u201d. This leads them astray. There is no truth in imagination. Stop picturing your soul and instead observe it, directly by silently, patiently, acquainting yourself with your inner reality. That means you have to attend inwardly without giving in to the habit of unconscious thought. It is by thought and imagination that the soul hides from itself, cloaks itself in false images and idols and worships those. Learn to attend to what-is within. Your spirit is nothing more than that which acts within you that cannot be observed directly, or that appears as \u201cnothing\u201d. You cannot know the spirit (or ghost) until you know the soul. Spirit is too close. It is the pure subject (being or observer) in you. Whilst you continue to believe that the soul is something other than the sensations and thoughts within you (your tangible but private inner experience) you cannot hope to identify spirit, for spirit has nothing tangible within it. Spirit is recognised by its effects. The soul overlaps the physical body (which is nothing more than the body revealed by your senses; and is public and tangible). This overlap is experienced as bodily sensations such as hunger, physical pain etc. Part of the soul that does not overlap with the physical body relates to itself. It does this when it daydreams, worries, judges or gets emotional, or (more rarely) rests in quiet contentment. It is clear in each of these examples that there is a sense of self or selfishness in this level of the soul. This is the part of ourselves we are responsible for straightening out. This is where we have our work cut out. Another part of the soul overlaps with the spirit, which, remember, is that part of us which has no tangible content, but nevertheless acts. One example of the spirit is your attention. You can show this to yourself by trying the following: Without moving your eyes, direct your attention so that as well as looking at these words (don\u2019t stop reading!) also, notice the periphery of your visual field\u2026 Did you notice that your attention got broader? It shifted from narrow to wide focus, didn\u2019t it? But what moved? Nothing tangible! Now, whilst continuing to read, notice the sounds around you\u2026 did you do it? Again, What moved? What shifted? Nothing you can \u2018see\u2019 or \u2018sense\u2019 - nothing tangible. The attention is like the zoom lens in a camera as you look through it. You can\u2019t see the lens, but you can detect its presence as it shifts focus. The attention is like this. It is obviously a real part of you, but it has no directly tangible qualities, nor personal or selfish attributes. It is a ghostly or spiritual aspect of your being. You experience the spirit in you when you are suddenly inspired, or get an insight out of nowhere. Where did that come from? You can\u2019t will inspiration or insight. Anyone who has suffered writers block will tell you that. It comes when it comes. That is the spirit. You can\u2019t detect inspiration directly, but you recognise it in its action or effect on your soul. Take the writer experiencing writers\u2019 block: they turn ideas over in their mind (thought), they assess and judge their ideas, they put some down on paper and read them back to themselves\u2026 all of this is soul activity. No matter how hard they try, nor how cross, frustrated or despondent (soul qualities) they get, they know they have not clinched it. Then suddenly, perhaps in the middle of the night, often when they are no longer thinking about it\u2026 bam! A bolt from the blue: Eureka! They\u2019ve got it\u2026 That\u2019s the Spirit. You don\u2019t do inspiration, it does it to you. One more: if you learn to quietly attend to the sensation inside every part of your body, you will gradually awaken the part of your soul that is able to receive the intimations of the spirit directly. As you learn to prefer being still within to thought and emotion you awaken the part of the soul that can recognise the spirit. One thing you can realise as you do this is that your habitual awareness is partial. That is, you have a lifetime habit of attending to only part of your being at a time (a thought, an object in your field of vision, a sensation that is bothering you\u2026) As you learn to broaden your attention to be aware of as much of your being as possible awareness turns into consciousness. You can only be aware of anything because consciousness is already conscious of it. Consider this: when you are reading intently, and are apparently unaware of your peripheral vision, how come you immediately notice if something moves in the corner of your eye (the cat, your mug falling over, a snake slithering into view)? Your consciousness is already looking at the entire field of vision, is already attending to your whole field of hearing, is already attending to every sensation and movement of thought within. Consciousness is an aspect of the spirit: pure 360 degree observation, permanent and effortless. Only the stilled, silent soul can recognise the spirit. Only when the soul gazes long enough on the spirit and is surrendered enough to find rest in contemplation of that spirit - it\u2019s love - can the spirit reveal the truth of God, for God is the reality behind the spirit, the nothing behind consciousness, the nothing behind everything, the beloved of the spirit. It\u2019s behind you now. How do I know this? Because I have done what I had to do. I have sufficiently cleared the selfish soul, found the love of the nothing that was always there, and, by grace, been shown this truth. Now, it\u2019s your turn. ",
