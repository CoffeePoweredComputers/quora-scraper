            "answer_text": "That must be a pretty great riff. Problem is, the better a riff it is, the more it\u2019s going to draw people\u2019s attention away from your song, and to the song it\u2019s from. They\u2019ll be distracted by your incomprehensible decision to swipe it as if to pass it off as your own, rather than come up with a riff of your own. Other answers stress the intellectual-property aspects of your question. Rightly so. You\u2019re not going to be able to do anything with this song. It\u2019s not your song - not if it has a piece of someone else\u2019s composition in it. You will never own it. You won\u2019t own your own song. Wow. I can\u2019t even imagine doing that. This must be a great riff. Well anyway, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting out of it, but if you\u2019re only going to play it for yourself, who can stop you? You should run into no trouble. As long as you\u2019re cool with somebody else owning your song. Literally - if you tried to use it they could claim 100% of what you made. Why don\u2019t you take the riff and play around with it? Take it to pieces and rearrange, shuffle it up. Stretch and bend. Pay attention to how it gets its effects. Hey, if the riff\u2019s that great you should have a blast, working theme and variations like an old-school classics composer! You can\u2019t lose. You\u2019ll probably come up with a number of useful riffs, for other songs of yours. Record yourself playing around, and play it back. I bet you find ONE RIFF that has the effect you want, for this song. A riff that\u2019s not theirs, it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s really worth a shot. Your song will be yours. ",

            "answer_text": "If it's a signature riff or a long riff, you'll probably want to get permission to make a derivative work. Most performers will be happy to oblige: a guitar picker will love the idea of someone wanting to swipe their licks. If it's just a lick in the middle of a ride, it might even be kosher to swipe. In addition it may have been used elsewhere before. A friend of mine used a cool riff that Buddy Emmons played on George Strait's Adalida, and the PRO people tried to raise a stink. The problem was that Emmons has been using that lick for decades. It's on Bottle Baby Boogie and the Justin Trevino recording of Who Will Buy the Wine. If you can find that riff in multiple places, you can make a case for it being a common musical idiomatic expression. Stealing from one is plagiarism: stealing from many is research. Let's say you borrowed the riff from Stevie Ray Vaughan\u2019s \u201cScuttle Buttin\u2019 \u201d for use in your own tune. If Vaughan\u2019s lawyers, or those of his label, come knocking, you have a rock solid defense. He stole it from Bill Doggett's \u201cHold It.\u201d Just to spite the big money, go get derivative work permission from Doggett's family, telling SRV's money-grubbing lawyers to pound sand. ",
