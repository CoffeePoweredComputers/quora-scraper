            "answer_text": "It depends on the quality of the musicians. If you have a good bass player who locks with the drummer, and you allow them to EQ so that they fill the sonic spectrum, then a melodic guitarist who plays riffs with the bass-player when appropriate is all you need. Think of Led Zeppelin and U2. If you have a keyboard player, as in Queen, you absolutely don\u2019t need to split out the role of melody and chords. If you\u2019re a beginner band (and we all started there), then you need the rhythm player all the time to keep the sound full. In the beginning, bands struggle to fill the sonic space, especially if they have two guitars and no keyboard. If two guitarists are playing flat out rhythm, then when the guitar solo starts, it seems like half of the support has vanished. At a particular point, bands find they are crowding the sonic space: everyone has a wider range of techniques, more sounds, and, often, better equipment. If you\u2019re faced with the choice of the lead guitarist leaving, or the rhythm guitarist, (a common issue in beginner bands, but sadly also with more established players), then you need to decide who is going to take the band where it\u2019s going. If your band has a high degree of showmanship provided by the lead guitarist, and they are also one of the main songwriters, then, no matter how hard they are to get on with, they are irreplaceable. On the other hand, if the rhythm guitarist is the guy who holds the band together socially, looks after all the other instrumentalists and keeps the singer happy, then they can probably integrate another lead guitarist. You need also to ask yourself: who is responsible for the band\u2019s distinctive sound? If the rhythm guitarist creates a complex bed of harmonic movement that the band floats over, then missing the occasional guitar solo is not going to be a problem. On the other hand, if melodic playing drives the band forwards, as it does with Led Zeppelin in Rock and Roll and Black Dog, then you need to keep the lead guitarist.  As others have said, the real issue is dividing players into \u2018rhythm\u2019 and \u2018lead\u2019. A good guitarist can move seamlessly from one to the other, and can even change the parts they are playing to suit the mood of the audience. Improvisation isn\u2019t just about choosing what notes to play, but also choosing what role to play. A cosy caf\u00e9 gig might require some tasteful, background, Dire Straits style rhythm with fills, but the same band playing on a big stage in front of a rock audience might need to change everything up.  Finally, if faced with a band bust-up where either the lead or rhythm player is going to leave, ask yourself: is one of them going to leave anyway, and is the band going to survive? If you\u2019ve realised that one of them has been discontent for a long time, their focus right now might be on one of the other musicians, but, ultimately, replacing the lead or rhythm guitarist won\u2019t keep them. So keep the guy who is going to stay. Equally, if the band relies on one of them to arrange gigs, do transport and arrange publicity, the band will not survive them leaving. Sometimes, the band won\u2019t survive whatever you do. Call it quits at the right time, and stay friends. ",

            "answer_text": "I like that question because it\u2019s a little offbeat. It\u2019s obviously best to be good at both lead and rhythm if you\u2019re going to be a maximally desirable gigster. However, every schlub in the universe wants to be a lead guitarist. That means that the world is glutted with pretty good lead guitarists who are mediocre rhythm players because they just don\u2019t really pay attention to it and put in the time. Sure, they can usually crank out some serviceable rhythm, but definitely don\u2019t shine as rhythm players. I\u2019ve been that guy before, but I was paying attention and realized that I needed to stop being lazy and up my game. If you asked rhythm section people who they\u2019d rather play with, a significant number will say they\u2019d prefer a great rhythm player, who can really drive and enhance the band\u2019s sound. People like Steve Cropper or Jimmy Nolen come to mind. In fact, if you\u2019re a great versatile rhythm player in a good-sized city, you may work a lot because everybody wants to play with you, especially if you\u2019re not a big diva like many lead players are. When I was subbing a lot in bands, a number of bassists and drummers told me that they really liked playing with me because of my time feel and because I was really listening to them, unlike their guitarists, who would sort of space out waiting for the next lead solo. It wasn\u2019t because I was a great rhythm player, but I am a very attentive one. I love accenting with the bassist and drummer and just locking in with them for a big groove. It\u2019s almost too much fun, and the band sounds great when that happens. To get back to your question, one could argue that a rhythm guitarist is more important, because you significantly impact the bands sound and play almost constantly. Even the most wanky bands usually don\u2019t have constant soloing, so somebody has to lay down chords and rhythm. A great solo is very exciting. If your lead specialist is killer, they may overshadow other band members and really be featured. But that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d, I\u2019m afraid. Everyone wants to be Jimi Hendrix, but not so many people are. By the way, Jimi was a superb rhythm player. Ultimately, try to do both, and then you\u2019ll gradually see what you find to be your specialty. ",
