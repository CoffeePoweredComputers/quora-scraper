            "answer_text": "Are you talking about a \u201cDJ Medley\u201d, or about arranging music for musicians to use in performance? That is, are you merging audio recordings (which several Quorans have assumed and already answered), or are you playing or preparing music for yourself or others to use in a live performance? If it\u2019s the former, you have some decent answers already. If it\u2019s the latter, here are some guidelines/ideas: Pick the ending first \u2026 you want a strong finish to your medley. Your opening song should be the 2nd best, or at least a very good one that will establish the theme for the medley (see #2 below). Hide any song you think might be \u201cweaker\u201d in the medley\u2019s interior, typically just before the great closer. ;-)The songs should be related in thematic material somehow: they\u2019re all about dancing, or all about love, or all by the same composer or made famous by the same recording artist/performer, etc. Tempo and key are not as critical in live performance as DJ mixes ... keep reading.As for \u201csame tempo\u201d, that\u2019s not as big a deal in this context. To go from a slow tune to a quicker one, insert an instrumental passage that accelerates. You can also hit a dead stop and do a \u201ccold entry\u201d to the next song in the medley. You can gradually decelerando, or even do a sudden ritardando, to get from a fast tune to a slower one, or, again, use the \u2018dead stop\u2019. Just don\u2019t \u201coveruse\u201d these elements, particularly the dead stop; a medley where every song is separated by a dead stop kind of ceases being a medley ;-) \u2014- your goal is to produce a musical experience that provides value to the listener by performing several related pieces, in quick succession, in less time than it would take to perform them all as separate pieces of music.Key changes are accomplished by modulation. This would require a rather lengthy treatise on music theory, but it\u2019s not always difficult. I\u2019ll provide a couple simple examples. You can modulate up a half step using a chord progression that ends with the Dominant Seventh chord of the new key; in C Major, for example: C, C/Bb, Ab7 \u2014-> Db. You can modulate to the subdominant (\u201cIV chord\u201d) via a direct modulation of its Dominant Seventh; in C Major, C, C7 -\u2192 F. You can modulate to the dominant (\u201cV chord\u201d) via a secondary dominant chord; in C Major, C, D7 \u2014-> G.Best of luck in arranging your musical medley! ",

            "answer_text": "Well that depends on the songs....  From personal experience it is easiest if they are in the same key and at a similar tempo, then you can simply make the jump from one progression of chords in the first song into the next (try to adjust tempo smoothly if needed)  You can modulate keys if needed to medley songs that are close (i.e. a medley where you are going from Eb into E, simply play both in E...)   You can drop to a cappella for the last chorus and then come right in on the next song on the 1 beat drop to just drums for a few bars (in a band setting)  Any medley will present its own challenges for you to figure out depending on the songs you are attempting to link together. Good luck.   ",
