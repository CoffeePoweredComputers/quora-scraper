            "answer_text": "Music was his purpose. As mentioned, Beethoven famously said that he would\u2019ve ended his life in suicide were in not for his art. He had music literally beaten into him from a young age, and he had no other venues to express himself. This is why Beethoven is generally agreed to have sparked the transition from classical to romantic, because he knew no other way to express himself. Not to say by any means that Beethoven\u2019s music reflected what he was feeling most of the time like Chopin\u2019s did, the sixth symphony was written amidst horrible depression, but to deny Beethoven\u2019s emotion and biography influencing his work would be ignorant. Beethoven came from a place where he had no control over a lot of what happened in his life. His father was a horrendously abusive alcoholic, his art couldnt survive with the aristocracy commisioning it, he lost his hearing. Beethoven used his art because he was truly in control. He could make masterpiece no one else could. His talent couldn\u2019t or atleast wouldnt be removed from him. Beethoven was also an irrefutably obsessive character. He spent 8 hours a day writing music, and to anyone who has ever composed by hand, the idea of spending more than 3 hours straight is horrifically frustrating. Beethoven composed because in his mind, he had no other option. ",

            "answer_text": "Beethoven\u2019s father was a court musician in Bonn. Beethoven followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and was taught by him. As a result Beethoven was immersed in music from an early age. Without a doubt, the child was gifted and his father envisioned creating a child prodigy. Subsequently Beethoven received instruction from Haydn, Albrechtsberger and Salieri. In 1782, before the age of 12, Beethoven published his first work, 9 Variations in C Minor for piano on a march by Earnst Christoph Dressler. Undoubtedly Beethoven had a burning desire to create music from this date or earlier. What started out as a practical way of generating income swiftly became the most powerful means of intellectual and emotional expression. ",
