            "answer_text": "Almost anything by the Allman Brothers Band, or the Grateful Dead. The ABB, with the exception of a short time when they substituted a piano, has always had two dynamic lead guitarists who could also play slide guitar, including Duane Allman, Dickey Betts, Jimmy Herring, Warren Haynes, and Derek Trucks as the most notable axemen in that band. On some songs, the two guitarists would take turns doing extended solos, and on others, they may play in unison in between individual solos. Allman Brothers Band - Back Where It All Begins The Allman Brothers Band - Mountain Jam ( At Fillmore East, 1971 ) The Allman Brothers Band - Whipping Post ( At Fillmore East, 1971 ) The Allman Brothers Band - In Memory of Elizabeth Reed ( At Fillmore East, 1971 ) The Allman Brothers Band - Blue Sky (Eat A Peach, February 12,1972) The Grateful Dead had two guitarists, Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia. Jerry was the traditional lead guitarist. Bob plays rhythm guitar, but he is not a simple strummer. I'm not a guitarist, so I struggle to describe his playing style, but suffice it to say that he is a more complex player than someone who strums simple chords in accompaniment with a lead guitarist. I saw Bob play a NYE midnight set one year in San Francisco in which there were only a trio on stage- Bob on guitar, with Dead bandmates Phil Lesh on bass and Bill Kreutzman on drums. I was expecting a very sparse sound from a trio when they normally played in a 6 piece band, but they surprisingly had a very full sound. These are three of my favorite complete studio albums: The Grateful Dead - American Beauty (\u00c1lbum Completo) [Full Album] The Grateful Dead - Mars Hotel (Album, June 27,1974) The Grateful Dead - In The Dark (Album -Re-Issue, July 6, 1987) Ask a thousand Deadheads which of their nearly 3k live shows was their nest and you will most likely get a thousand different answers. Archive(dot)org Digital Library of Free Books, Movies, Music & Wayback Machine has all their complete shows. This is just one of many shows: Grateful Dead Live at Barton Hall on 1977-05-08 : Free Streaming : Internet Archive ",

            "answer_text": "Although it maybe a little havier than what you have in mind, old school bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer to newer bands like as I lay dying, Killswitch engage, Avatar lamb of God and many others actually have two guitar players their are alot like Pantera who only have one guitarist but will overlap 2 or even up to 5 rythem and lead track's on one song as dimebag and Zakk Wylde often do. You can also just split up single track songs into rythem and lead and take turns playing different verses and solos and shit like that. Think of every song with a guitar solo and behind the solo theirs always a backing track going on to make it all flow seamlessly ",
