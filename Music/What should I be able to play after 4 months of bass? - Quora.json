            "answer_text": "This is a tricky question to answer due to the fact it depends on how much time and effort you put into actual practice as to how much proficiency you will have with the bass in 4 months. I have been to music school and seen a lot of guys go from beginner to extremely good in a very short amount of time. I had a huge jump in musical proficiency 3 times in my life so far and each time it was due to spending more time actually practicing and playing my guitar than anything else. With all that being said I can give you a list of things I think a bass player who spends 4 months practicing diligently from beginning should know: All the notes on the neck. This is actually very easy to do with a system of memorization. Major and minor pentatonic scales in as many keys as possible. Major and minor scales in as many keys as possible. Some rudimentary walking basslines and turnarounds from different styles of music. Rudimentary Blues basslines. Learning about triads: knowing what they are, the formulas that make each one. (major, minor, augmented, diminished) Learning about chord progressions and how to compose them yourself. Being able to play with a band and hold a rudimentary groove. As much theory as you can cram into your brain will help immensely in your understanding of music and how to play and communicate with others. This is how I learned all the notes all over the guitar neck. You can adapt it to bass to learn the system. Do all great guitarists know every note on the guitar neck by heart? What is the best way to learn that? These are just some general guidelines I just thought up. Your experience may vary depending on how much time a day or week you devote to practicing and studying. I hope this helps you with your understanding of music. Good luck and have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "It really, really depends. It is like asking how strong or in shape you should be after 4 months of working out\u2026. Are you taking lessons? Really good teacher? How often are you practicing at home? How many hours a day? What do you mean by \u201cable to play\u201d? Bach? Bachmann Turner Overdrive? Country? Jazz? My background; I took 2 years of bass lessons starting at 14. At 4 months I could read the bass chart pretty well except for some keys. I could do quite a few scales. I went to bass lesson every week for an hour, then practiced my lesson material 1 hour a day every day. Then I practiced our rock band songs 1 hour a day, also rehearsing with the band on Saturdays for a couple of hours. I learned rhythm guitar after 2 years so I could learn bass chords better. I have played guitar and keyboards also. I play out on an average of once a week in a classic rock band. I think I am almost competent. You think you start getting good, and people tell you that, then you go see somebody awesome and you get put back in your place. This help? ",

            "answer_text": "Very elastic situation. Sheer amount of time is important, but so isaptitude, and how you apply your aptitude over time!I used to study for several years with a world class bassist. He left the states and teaches in Paris for many years now.But I try to apply the multi pronged approach he imparted to meeven today . Ear training, music theory/ideas, and actual bass playing.The actual bass playing will go farther and faster and better with the first twobeing part of it. Many good ear training apps online you can use - I use Earplane.Building your ear lends confidence to your playing and greatly reduces frustrationin making your hands go where your ear hears you needing to be! And theory(chord structure, scales, modes, intervals) is really important as it is the \u201cbackstory\u201dto what you are TRYING to play. I found \u201cScotts Bass Lessons\u201d on YouTube to be the best most inspirational video lessons. But there are many others with a lot to offer.Divide your time between pushing forward your \u201cchops\u201d (learning new licks, new songs, new techniques) and the ear/music. I started learning \u201cDonna Lee\u201d back in the 80s and kind of fell off working it, only to finally finish and get it down just a few years ago! Music Minus One files are also EXCELLENT for building improve skillsif you do not have live jamming partners. ",

Can you do a walk in major and minor up and down the neck? those are the things I was shooting for as I learned bass. Same with guitar, actually. now, for some fun fun fun homework. learn \u2018anathesia - pulling teeth\u2019 from Metallica. It is amazing, and the first thing I worked on learning bass (to be fair, though, I had been playing guitar for 20 years when our bass player quit\u2026 so I had the fundamentals. and if you enjoy the rock, and I pray you do\u2026 listen to lots of Iron Maiden. Not only is it great bass, but the bass player (Steve Harris) IS Iron Maiden. It is his band, on every level. He writes the songs, lyrics, hires, and fires. Watch his fingers melt your brain! normally, I would link some Maiden and Cliff Burton below from youtube. But, I am at work, and they (wisely) proxy that out for us. ",

            "answer_text": "You should definitely be able to ably play any chord progression thrown your way. By \u201cably play\u201d, I mean that you should be able to work with the root note, but also the third, fifth, octave, etc. You should also be able to play most walking bass parts easily, and switch them up a bit. If you haven't learned pentatonic scales yet, you should start. It will help with soloing. You should, at this point, have major and minor scales memorized. You should read tab well, as well as the notes (quarter, eighth, dotted notes, etc) and a smart bass player would either know how to read bass clef or at least starting to learn how to. If you can do most of this stuff, I'd say you're off to a good start. Have fun playing! ",

Learn a couple scales(practice them) go to youtube and look for drum tracks to play along to using the scales. And of course learn songs. nirvana is a good place to start. Start listening to bass in every genre of music and pay attention to the rythms they use. ",
