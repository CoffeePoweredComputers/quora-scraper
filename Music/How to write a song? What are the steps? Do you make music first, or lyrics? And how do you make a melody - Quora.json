            "answer_text": "There are lots of songwriting \"rules,\" many of which have been successfully broken when some aspect of the song is just so compelling that the rules don't matter. They're easy to find so I won't repeat all of those here. Rather I'll give you three things which I believe live above the \"laws\" of songwriting. Listen to songs. I know that sounds obvious, but I mean listen actively to a lot of songs you consider good. Pay close attention to lengths of verses and choruses, how the energy rises and falls throughout, when and where the writer leaves space, and everything else you can apprehend. Say something universal, but in a way that sounds personal. All great songs do this. The song is ostensibly about \"him\" or \"her\" or \"me\" but in reality it's about eveyone. Otherwise it would be boring and self-indulgent, like a friend who only talks about himself and his problems. This is probably the hardest thing for a beginning songwriter to accomplish, so have patience. Songs are fundamentally an emotional vehicle, not a logical or technical one. Any reference, detail, repetition, chord, instrument, or anything else involved in your song should serve a unified emotional purpose. If it doesn't, it's extraneous and will be in the way no matter how important it seemed at the time. And have fun. Keep in mind that most of today's hit songs are written by committee, assembled by teams and focus groups to conform to the requirements of specific artists' marketing needs. The songs you write probably won't sound like that, but they'll mean more to you and feed the natural desire to express ideas and emotion, which is much more worthwhile. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been writing songs since I was 15 or so.  By far the best foundation for me was listening to and singing along with songs of all kinds, anything hat resonated or was just fun to sing.  Of course I wasn't doing it with any kind of conscious plan to get skills at melody writing or lyric writing, but like others here I agree listening to and singing as much as possible will only benefit you when you come to write something yourself.   My method varies:  sometimes I like jamming on an acoustic guitar a simple chord progression and singing (often nonsense lyrics) whatever comes to mind, and a melody or at least tone of song and maybe a line of lyrics will come from that.  Then I'll make time to expand the lyrics.  I don't usually write out an outline but it definitely helps to spend some time thinking or plotting out the theme or story, genre or emotional tone, and with these noting any particular lyrics that come to mind, even if it's just a couple of words that you like and think would have a place in the song.   Having a notebook or a good app for note taking is great to jot down any ideas that come to mind throughout your day, and it is so worth it to jot down any little ideas or phrases that may turn into songs in the future.   My other method is to write out a lyric first and set it to music later.  Actually I like to do this with any text, I often take poetry by others and turn it into a song, this can be great practice as you don't have to come up with the lyrics, so you're just focussing on melody/genre, and you can try to set the words to several different styles of music, just for fun.  But in the case of a completed lyric of my own, I'll try to picture the sound I want (fast, slow, sad, happy, etc) and again, take out the guitar or sit down at the piano and base it on simple chord progressions.  The complexities of the song (if you want them or feel they're necessary) can come later.   Finally, probably the best advice I can offer is to be patient with yourself.  Like any creative endeavor, you'll have times of plenty and times of famine, and the good stuff can't be forced.  So when the well is dry try not to get down on yourself about it, but accept that the time just isn't right and go do something completely different.  You might just find yourself humming a new tune or churning over a memory while you go for a walk or have a shower that may end up being the basis for a new song (my wife even got me a waterproof paper notepad, the kind surveyors use, to jot down lyrics that come to me in the shower, as they often seem to!). All the best in your songwriting.  If your interested in hearing what I've been up to, I'm at the following:http://phillipleross.bandcamp.com ",
