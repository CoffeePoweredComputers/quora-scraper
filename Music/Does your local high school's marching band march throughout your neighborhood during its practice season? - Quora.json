            "answer_text": "If we hop in the way-back machine, my marching band did this. We moved into a brand-new high school that did not have a field for us. The nearest field we could mark was about a half mile away, behind an elementary school. So just after school let out, we\u2019d gather ourselves, line up ranks in the school marking lot, and then march down to our practice field. We\u2019d rehearse for a couple of hours, and then march back to the school. Back then, weekend competitions sometimes had parade routes early in the morning. For example, we had a morning parade and then an afternoon into evening exhibition of bands. Maybe 8 or 10 bands would show up. Some of those contests would also give out awards for the parade portion of the competition, and our band routinely won awards for marching. We had lots of practice at it. We were also invited to march in the Indy 500 pre-race parade. Unfortunately, back then for us, Macy\u2019s or Disney World was way out of reach. I\u2019m not even sure if Bands of America was running back then. ",

            "answer_text": "I went to school in Plano, TX. The high schools are split into two halves. The junior high schools, of which there are about 12, are for grades 9\u201310, and the senior highs of which there are three, are for grades 11\u201312. You will find that the marching bands for the junior high will march and play around the neighborhood when they first start learning to play and march at the same time, or prior to a parade, just so we can get used to playing and marching in that format.

            "answer_text": "We actually do, but not in the way you might be seeking. We do what we call the \u201cMarchathon\u201d, where we march through rich neighborhoods and charge people $20-$60 for us to play a stand tune for them on their lawn. It is highly successful and gets us nearly $10,000 a year. It does tach our members a little endurance though, because we usually go for about 7 miles. ",
