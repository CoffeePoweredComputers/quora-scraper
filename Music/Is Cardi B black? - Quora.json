            "answer_text": "Yes. Even though she\u2019s officially Dominican, she\u2019s Black. Let me explain: Here\u2019s a clip from Dave Chappelle\u2019s show: The Racial Draft It\u2019s hilarious because it shows different races \u201cclaiming\u201d people based on a certain racial factor or because, despite outward appearances, they come from a cultural place closer to another race. Cardi B may not be technically African American, but she is accepted as being from \u201cThe Hood\u201d for lack of a better word. She is OF Black Culture, (or perhaps to be more specific New York\u2019s Black Culture.) and for many people that\u2019s good enough. DJ Khaled is Palestinian. Rihanna is from Barbados. But they are generally accepted as \u201cBlack\u201d. Even Eminem, clearly White, is generally accepted within in the Black community as \u201cLegit\u201d given both 1) his skills and 2) the environment he grew up in. Robin Thicke and Hall & Oates get the label \u201cBlue-Eyed Soul\u201d and also have many African American fans. The late Teena Marie \u2014who came of age prior to MTV \u2014 was long thought to be Black by people who heard her only on the radio. On the other hand, not everyone gets that treatment: Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish has a largely White fanbase. So too do singers Carly Simon and Halsey who are both part African American. Basically, it\u2019s often more about culture and your genre than just skin color. ",

Does she have African ancestry I\u2019m sure she does, the real question is how she classify herself. Many people who have African ancestry but are from the islands consider themselves Dominican, Haitian, Puerto Rican, Cuban etc then either Afrolatina or Afrofrench etc. ",
