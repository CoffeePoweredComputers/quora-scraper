            "answer_text": "No. Scale length is wrong. The tension on electric Bass strings is different than acoustic Bass strings and could potentially damage your instrument. Electric Bass strings are made to vibrate in front of magnetic pickups to generate sound. Acoustic Bass strings are meant to vibrate acoustically to reproduce sound from the Bass itself. There are other, but I think you get the idea that they won\u2019t work. ",
