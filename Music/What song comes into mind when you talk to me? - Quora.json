The song changes in every three - four days, so I can't name any specific song which I think of while talking to you. But, there's one song which I associate you with a lot: \u201cBeliever\u201d by Imagine Dragons. As you might expect, there's a small history behind it, but you didn't ask for it. So I won't talk about it here. SG  PS: this end signature is getting pointless now, yet I can't just stop using it. I've been using it for too long already. ",
