            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll save myself a bit of grief and start with \u2018credentials\u2019. I have played bass for over 50 years, most every venue and genre. I have a Kay standup that was purchased when I was born and have owned a wide assortment of electrics over the years including fretless electrics. A fretless instrument has voicing. Like a voice every analog wavelength is available, you must select the right one. There are a few things you can do with a fretless instrument that you can not do at all, or only poorly, with a fretted one. The obvious ones are smooth slides, pitch bends and tremolo. You can even do the bizarre and impossible verses a fretted. Just because it put a smile on our very gifted jazz guitar player every single time, I used to sneak in a five note run from C to D. Those notes would be C, C &1/2, C#, C#&1/2 and D. The tune was 5/4 time and no one but him ever noticed. The very fist time I did that was at practice and he froze, and said \u201cHey you can\u2019t do that.\u201d My answer was \u201cWrong, you can\u2019t do that, I can. See.\u201d and played it again. We also played an old tune that started with two beats on Gm, two on B# and kept that up for several bars. I just played a slide between the two notes on my E string. The job of bass is to build a wave and that works like a dream. It also sounds unlike anything you have heard out of a fretted bass. They also sound different for everyone who plays them because they allow for or even exacerbate tiny nuances in fingering. You can pitch a full dime just by rolling your finger a bit. Like singing however these things are only an \u201cadvantage\u201d if you also have the ear to apply them correctly. Someone with out a good ear and accurate fretting will sound awful on a fretless and even worse on a bass fiddle. Hope that shed a little light. Thanks for the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly it\u2019s because of the tone. You can get a great growl or \u201cmwah\u201d sound from the strings vibrating right on the fingerboard, especially with roundwound strings. Combine that with a good vibrato on your fingering hand and you can get a singing, shimmering sound - very expressive. You can also slide and slur for some interesting effects. You\u2019ll have the ability to get to the \u201cin-between\u201d pitches that you can\u2019t on a fretted bass because the frets force you into regular pitches. You can also do slides with harmonics (play a harmonic then press finger to fingerboard and slide up to another position). Lastly, you can compensate for an out of tune string by playing a little sharp or flat on the fly - useful if you don\u2019t have time to tune up in the middle of a song. Some things you can\u2019t do well on a fretless because of the absence of frets. Anything that needs aggressive fret sound as part of the tone, slapping, and tapping are things that aren\u2019t suitable. ",
