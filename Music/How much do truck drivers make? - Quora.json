            "answer_text": "I would just like to add a comment on top of everyone else's answers, that, for me, I have found a driver's pay to correlate to the type of freight being hauled. when I began my driving career with the now bankrupt, Arrow Trucking Co., which left me and hundreds of other drivers stranded around the country three days before Christmas in 2009, I was making .28c/mile. I had zero commercial driving experience before working for this company, so I thought this was fair. I was also paid $30.00 for tarping the load if it was a flatbed load of lumber, and $20.00 if it was a coil of steel. on top of that, there was the industry standard layover pay, holiday and sick pay, etc. in 2010 I thought I would try and drive a van (boxed/enclosed trailer) like Rick, in the answers here, drives\u2026..not for me. those guys do A LOT of driving. totally different than driving a flatbed, where the average load was 350 miles and a lot of physical activity, compared to a van\u2019s average load of anywhere from a few miles to thousands of miles and basically zero physical activity. the primary difference is, when driving a flatbed you must secure the freight to the trailer, as opposed to driving a van, pretty much just close the doors and put the seal on. pay is reflected in physical work performed. in 2013, I added my hazmat endorsement to my license and began driving tanker trucks. a little bit more money per mile because of the obvious hazardous work, about the same load and unload pay as driving a flatbed but no where near as much work. I find driving tankers the ideal driving job because it's not too much driving without getting out of the truck (to hook up hoses and load/offload) but not as much physical activity as driving a flatbed. driving tanker pays well, very well in my opinion, the average load (for me) about 600 miles out, 2 - 4 hours un/loading, for about $450\u2026..not bad for a (if I hustle) day's work note: when strapping down a load on a flatbed, it takes a lot of practice to do it in under two hours. take a lumber tarp, for example - an 8\u2032 drop tarp weighing in at around 100 pounds. if the weather is uncomfortable and the forklift driver who stacked 10\u2032 of lumber on your trailer doesn't want to lift your tarp to the top of the load, you will be working very, very hard for your $30.00 tarp pay lolthere is sort of a sub-catagory, with a different pay grade, in driving flatbeds. the highest paying flatbed loads are oversized loads and I believe this is the highest paying commodity in trucking.although there is a pay difference between the type if trailer you drive, there is no hierarchy out here. all drivers are equal and are treated as such, regardless of the trailer driven or pay grade",

            "answer_text": "Well, that depends. Your first 1 to 1 1/2 years you might see an average of $30k to $40k per year. Might sound like a lot to some folks but you have to consider how many hours you typically put in per week (at least 70 if you are long haul). When you do that then you will realize you're not getting paid much more than minimum wage in some cases when you break it down. But don't worry because, if you've kept your record clean during that time, something wonderful happens afterward: other firms will be very, very interested in you, and your pay will skyrocket. It's not uncommon to see experienced drivers making $70k or more per year. That being said, the big money is in specialized hauling; I'm talking about car carriers, tankers, flatbed, heavy haul - more than just the usual dry freight. Those guys can make a pretty good living because of the extra qualifications, skill and responsibilities those jobs incur. I've seen car haulers making over $85k before and I've done it myself so I know it's possible. Even bigger money can be made as an owner operator however you will also have bigger risks. A lot of drivers try going that route but often fail within the first couple of years; my theory is that they've figured out how to drive a truck but often forget that they are also running a business. Also, you won't have anyone holding your hand: the fuel, taxes, finding loads, repairs, paperwork - all of that is on You and no one else. Big risks, big responsibilities - but (if you run your business right) also big rewards. ",
