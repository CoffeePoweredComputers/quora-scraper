            "answer_text": "I have a couple of theories here\u2026one that could be related to the other: 1) It could be that Hall of Fame officials didn\u2019t like the fact that ROSS didn\u2019t show up for the Supremes\u2019 induction. Why induct her TWICE ? She probably wouldn\u2019t show up for THIS one, either. 2) Ross has a bad reputation for being a DIVA . A lot of people at Motown simply didn\u2019t like her because of it. She and Mary Wilson hadn\u2019t talked in years\u2026and the only time they DID share a stage, during Motown 25, there was an incident , where Ross pushed Mary onstage\u2026and grabbed the mike\u2026so that SHE could introduce Berry Gordy, who was seated in the audience, after MARY had already done so. ROSS was also a no-show during the filming of the Supremes\u2019 2006 Motown DVD. MARY introduced all of the tunes \u2026and did the narratives and song histories.  It has been a long known fact that Mary blames ROSS for Supreme FLORENCE BALLARD\u2019S DOWNFALL\u2026.and subsequent REMOVAL from the group\u2026which eventually led to her death. Since then , ROSS had pretty much washed her hands of The Supremes\u2026and Mary had washed HER hands of ROSS. She said in an interview, that she wasn\u2019t even told of the possible \u201creunion\u201d until the wheels had already began to turn\u2026and the plans had already been put in place. Mary thought this was disrespectful of HER legacy as an ORIGINAL MEMBER\u2026and the comparatively small amount that SHE would get compared to ROSS made things even WORSE. Many other people in the industry feel the same\u2026so to give ROSS a second induction is something that quite probably WON\u2019T happen. MARY WILSON accepts induction for THE SUPREMES into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\u2026accompanied by Florence\u2019s daughter , LISA. Diana was a NO SHOW. (1988)  MARY on with Bryant Gumbel on THE TODAY SHOW (1990)  MARY on THE TALK ( 2020)  MARY REMEMBERS and DEFENDS FLORENCE (2020)  MARY on DIANA ROSS (Several interviews)  ",

            "answer_text": "Well that\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s also questionable as to why she\u2019s never won a competitive Grammy (neither solo, nor with the Supremes), especially since she\u2019s churned out plenty of the kind of pap Grammy voters love (\u201cEndless Love\u201d anyone? UGH) My best guess is for the same reason that Cher, Bette Midler, Barbra Streisand, solo Phil Collins, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are not in: the RnR HOF tends to look down on \u201cold-school pop singers.\u201d She has had a number of hit singles, but she had very few classic albums, Diana and The Boss being the main ones. The HOF largely looks at albums. Amongst many critics who pay attention to innovation, influence and relevance, Ross has always been too lightweight in all three categories. Also: one can surmise that she\u2019s made a few enemies in the industry, thanks to a Diva attitude. Also, there\u2019s the affair she had with Motown founder Berry Gordy, and in return, the favors he showered her with, from promoting her into a solo career to roles in movies produced by Motown. (some in which she performed well like Lady Sings the Blues, and some she was ill-suited for, like The Wiz.) People tend to frown on you when your success seems to come through suspect means. Famously, Mary Wilson has been Ross\u2019 strongest detractor, casting aspersions on both her talent and definitely her character. It has been implied by many that Ross and Gordy bear some responsibility for the tragic life and death of The Supremes Florence Ballard. And then there was that ersatz Supremes reunion which struck a bad note with many. In recent years, her image has been somewhat refreshed to that of Living Legend; she\u2019s one of our last links to that old fashioned showbiz era and is still touring yearly well into her 70s. But the RnR HOF may remain out of reach. ",
