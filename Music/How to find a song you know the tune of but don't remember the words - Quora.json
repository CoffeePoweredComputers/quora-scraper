That isn\u2019t always possible so the way I\u2019ve had to do it before is to just listen to a bunch of songs until you find it. If it\u2019s on the radio or in a public place most likely its going to be on a top song list of the genre. Your best bet would be to go to a music streaming service such as Spotify or Apple Music or even YouTube and find what are the top songs of the genre the song is. You can then listen to snippets of each song and go from there. ",

If you were then you could ask them if they can remember when\u2026. Etc etc! Also, how old were you roughly and was it a song you recall hearing on numerous occasions at that time or just once or twice?? As you could then try to search through releases from around that time/year\u2026 Should it be a song you recall being played frequently then it is likely to of been popular and therefore likely to have been in the charts, which I imagine are easily accessible with a search on Google or two :) x ",
