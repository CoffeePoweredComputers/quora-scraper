            "answer_text": "Specialised software always gives better experience. Spotify focus on music. Podcasts have to treated different and I think a single app cant do justice to both. Take an example of the genre which applies to music - rock, instrument etc. Also see the genre which applies to podcast - news, business etc. If spotify has to support both, these will have to be mixed and that is not good. So specialisation is the key. Another good reason is music makes spotify a lot of money with each sale of music. Podcasts cant be compared in the same leage. ",
