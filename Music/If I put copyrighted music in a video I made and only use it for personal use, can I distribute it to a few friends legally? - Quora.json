If its truly personal use, go for it, just don\u2019t upload it someplace online where people can view it. Be safe if you do put it online. Either purchase a license to use the music legally, or use some of the royalty-free music - there\u2019s a lot of good sites out there with quality music. Just be sure you\u2019re using the music as described and intended. ",
