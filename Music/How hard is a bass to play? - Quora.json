            "answer_text": "Not particularly but once you learn the basics, bass can be as complicated as you choose to make it. I've been playing bass for 30 years. I started out as a basic rock bassist, mostly providing the backbeat with the drummer and adding a little fill here and there. Later I worked on becoming a more melodic bassist and began playing more complex patterns with more interesting fills. I consider myself a fairly decent bassist but nothing particularly special. My son on the other hand followed in my footsteps but he was more interested in jazz and bass theory than I was at his age. He's been playing bass for about 7 years and he's way ahead of where I was at that age (heck, he's better than I am now) His playing style is much more complex and technical and his fills are well thought out. I should mention that he is somewhat of a musical prodigy and plays several instruments with just about equal proficiency, so not everyone will advance as quickly as he did. So basically, bass is as easy or hard as you choose to make it. I think its worth mentioning that playing repetitive, single note bass lines like some hard rock bassists can get rather boring though.

            "answer_text": "When a bass player is playing live with a band and their mind floats off into a different world for just one second. It could throw the entire band out of rhythm. The bass controls the rhythm, not the drums as you would think. Sometimes they control each other like the great Sly and Robbie, but if the drummer messes up it usually doesn\u2019t effect the basses world as much. Although bass lines are much simpler than all the rest of the stringed instruments, the bass is the only one that would be noticeable to everyone if it is off. Have you tried dancing to a song with a drunk bass player? It makes you the dancer look drunk too. There\u2019s no other instrument besides the drum that really has this much effect. So to answer your question. Yes.. the bass is pretty hard to learn, but that\u2019s depending on who you are. If you are good at repetition and have a good sense of rhythm then you might pick it up quickly. If you are more of an artist person that likes to create and gets bored easily, then you might want to consider a different instrument. Bass players are different than the rest of the band. They are usually a bit more structured. So there\u2019s no way to say if it is easy to learn bass because for some it could be really difficult. ",
