            "answer_text": "It is no longer an era where going to a strip club is considered a sin. Even the so-called judgmental society has started to embrace the strip clubs. People hit Miami strip club, take their friends along, enjoy the drinks and snacks, and most importantly watch the female strippers dancing on the pole. But only a few people are interested in knowing \u201cwhat exactly the life of the female strippers in strip clubs is like\u201d? While some ladies enjoy their job in Miami clubs others have to do it to earn their living.  Well, lap dances earn significant bucks to the female strippers. You can expect to earn hundreds of dollars if you manage to give lap dances to the wealthy clients. All that you have got to do is get off the pole, walk around, find a right client, initiate the conversation, and that\u2019s it. If they feel like getting a private lap dance from you, you have done your job. When you interact with your clients or you carry out your job in strip clubs, you no more remain the real you. Whether the stripper is married or she has a boyfriend, she is supposed to give her best in the strip club by flirting with men, giving them lap dances, and encouraging them to spend some additional bucks on the strip club services. In simple terms, you can\u2019t hesitate, feel awkward, or shy in strip clubs. The clients have come to fulfill their fantasy. And it\u2019s your responsibility to accomplish their desire. Thank You.
