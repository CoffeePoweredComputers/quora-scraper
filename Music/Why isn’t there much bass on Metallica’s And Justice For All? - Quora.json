            "answer_text": "There is an interview with the mixer from that album on youtube where he explains this. - Lars came into the studio where it was mixed, with James and told him to turn down the bass a little, then a little more, and then \u201call the way down\u201d. Lars was satisfied, and the mixer also asked if James liked the mix, and he just had a certain body posture and a gesture that suggested that he agreed to whatever Lars decided. The mixer said in the interview that he regretted not saving the masters before the bass was turned all the way down. Back in those days, quite simular to today, Lars and James \u201cdrive\u201d the vehicle of Metallica while the two other members that are/have been in the band takes the backseat. They were young, and into different drugs and alcohol. They knew best, like most young confident people do. ",
