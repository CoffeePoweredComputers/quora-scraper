It is accepted universally that the more we practise or recite or listen to something the deeper it gets stored in our cereberum..so in this case the songs..Just think of how many times do you listen to your favourite song and then sing it as well.More you listen the deeper it gets into your subconscious mind.So when you listen to the same song after a long time your brain has to just recall it from your subconscious mind and voila you remember the song.",
