            "answer_text": "Songs are the larger brush strokes used for generic scenes whilst the soundtrack scores are used for the nuance required to provide the emotional undercurrent for different characters or scenes. Scores have soundscapes or themes composed specifically for these parts of the film in alignment with the directors vision. Many films these days have more atmospheric or textural scores such as with Social Network or Sicario without much thematic material providing tension and a sense of pace. Martin Scorsese or Quintin Tarantina for example use songs more readily to illustrate a certain period or to impact the audience with associations they may have already built-up. Some composers like Hans Zimmer compose music that is closer to the story/fore and are closer in style to more popular music and others closer to classical music like Alexandre Desplat. ",

            "answer_text": "You don't have to look very far to see comments like \"Those songs are bad\". It's easy to say music is all subjective, but that more often ends a discussion rather than begin one. So I'd rather pry: How are they bad? Can you articulate what it is that makes you like or hate them? Why do you like any song or set of songs? The inherent aesthetics of the sound? (Which aspects? Melody, timbre, chord progression?) The artist's background? (Would you enjoy it as much if you did not know the artist?) The lyrics? (Would you enjoy it as much if you could not understand them?) Skill with a voice or an instrument? (What makes a skilled singer/player such that it translates positively to the listener?) For example, I like video game music a lot, but not really other genres. The limited design space (generated sounds, no lyrics, limited processing power, changes dynamically with the pace of the game) forced the artists to innovate and create some unique iconic sounds, and having grown up with games, I can relate very readily to them. I like how the notes can influence my emotions even in the absence of lyrics, and I don't quite understand how, so it's like a game in and of itself. (Sometimes I think there's something wrong with me for my apathy toward more popular music...) ",
