            "answer_text": "Some really good answers here but I as someone that plays both trumpet and clarinet I\u2019d like to speak about what\u2019s hard about each of them. Trumpet: Stamina!!!!! - This is IMO the hardest challenge that the trumpet offers. Playing the trumpet is much more painful than most expect. You will often experience your \u2018lip going\u2019 due to pressing the trumpet into your lips, cutting off circulation and causing them to temporarily stop working. Often trumpet players will be able to identify other trumpet players by a small circular scar on the lips. Pitching - On the trumpet (and all other brass instruments) each combination of valves offers multiple notes. You adjust the tightness of your lips to determine which note is produced. If you aren\u2019t precise with this or your lips are tired the note will note be clean. It may be \u2018split\u2019 where it seems briefly partway between two notes before you correct it or it may be mispitched producing entirely the wrong note. Most wind instruments require a \u2018musical ear\u2019 to some extent but the trumpet requires more pitching than most others. Clarinet: Pain: Holding the clarinet in your mouth involves folding your bottom lip in over your lower front teeth and resting the reed on top. This means that your teeth end up digging into the inside of your lower lip. Eventually you\u2019ll build up a patch of dead skin there and it won\u2019t become painful as fast but it never really stops completely. This doesn\u2019t cut of circulation like it does with the trumpet so with a bit of grit you\u2019ll still be able to play but it\u2019s a much sharper pain. The Break: Clarinet fingering is for the most part fairly logical. More fingers is lower and as you take fingers off the note gets higher\u2026 sort of like a recorder. However\u2026. Moving from a Bb in the stave to the B above involves quickly moving from only 2 fingers used to 9 fingers. This makes some fast passages extremely difficult! Construction: Most clarinets come in 5 pieces. You\u2019ll need to put these pieces together each time you play then fit the ligature and reed to the mouthpiece (being careful not to damage your favourite reed!) Then when you\u2019ve finished playing you\u2019ll need to clean the inside and disassemble it again. Despite (and sometimes because) of these challenges both of these instruments are incredibly fun and rewarding to play and whichever you choose you\u2019ll be learning a great instrument! ",

            "answer_text": "I like Dylan Quattro\u2019s answer a lot. My opinion differs only in that I think all instruments are equally difficult to play well. It takes just as long to learn to play a clarinet well as it takes to play the trumpet well. Do not let that idea influence your thoughts. Clarinet is definitely not rather easily learned. Must be a trumpet player stating this ;) To emphasize the equal difficulty to learn any instrument I bring this video clip showing that even learning to play the triangle well it takes practice. An you thought anybody could play that!  As Dylan explained think more about the passion for the style and the kind of music you want to play. Where is you love? If you don\u2019t have love for either instrument go and play saxophone. ",
