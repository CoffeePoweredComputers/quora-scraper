            "answer_text": "When you\u2019re a beginner you need immediate feedback from someone with a good ear and singing experience that will correct you when you do something wrong, otherwise you\u2019re not learning from experience. Watching videos on how to sing are only telling you things. If you don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re doing something correctly you can\u2019t change it. (It\u2019s like reading an article about pole vaulting. The author can explain all they want about how to do it, but until you find a coach that will teach you to use the muscles and breath in the right way you will never really experience it). To learn how to sing correctly from the very beginning, get a voice teacher! Otherwise you\u2019re just waisting your time. ",

In the end it may only be a few that are free. In your neighborhood check the recreation center. Sometimes you can find people hiding lesson at discount prices. ",
