            "answer_text": "Hey Quora, why is this answer appearing under \u201cWhere were you when MJ died?\u201d? I answered this in response to a question about radio stations playing a lot of Van Halen after EVH\u2019s death. Get it together Quora. What a bunch of oafs. The simple answer is yes, but I also believe you\u2019re experiencing confirmation bias. The phrase \u201cthe radio\u201d doesn\u2019t mean what it did 2 \u2013 3 decades ago, when it primarily meant a finite number of local or powerful broadcasters that played specific formats of music - like a classic rock radio station or a pop radio station etc. Today there are literally tens of thousands of so-called radio stations available via the airwaves, the Internet, satellite and other broadband services etc. My guess is that you\u2019re into rock from the Van Halen era - the very late 70\u2019s through the 80\u2019s - or classic rock, more broadly defined. Because of that, that\u2019s your definition of \u201cthe radio\u201d. And because those are the radio stations you listen to, by default that\u2019s the format of music they\u2019re playing, with extra emphasis on musicians who recently died or were in the news for some other reason. If you were listening to most of the other thousands of radio stations out there, you would not be hearing non-stop Van Halen, or probably any Van Halen at all. That\u2019s confirmation bias. But yes, when other famous musicians died, the radio stations which featured their genre of music in their formats did play their music extensively after their deaths. When John Lennon died in 1980, the number of radio stations was limited, as I described in the first paragraph, and many radio stations which didn\u2019t normally play pop or 60\u2019s - 70\u2019s rock switched to playing a lot of Beatles and solo Lennon music for a few weeks. Or they slipped some of it into their usual formats. ",

When Prince died I was driving home in the evening after I went out with my wife and I noticed that they played 3 Prince songs in a row and I thought, ok that can only mean that Prince died today and it turned out to be the case.
