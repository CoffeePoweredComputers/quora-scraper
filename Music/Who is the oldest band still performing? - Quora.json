However, unlike some bands that still perform today with few, if any, original members (The Beach Boys, for example), the original members of The Seekers continued to perform and tour right up to a few years ago, long enough to do their Golden Anniversary tour to celebrate the 50 years since their first performance together in a Melbourne coffee house. Some 57 years later, Athol, Keith and Bruce continue to perform today as The Seekers with a replacement for Judith, whose health prevents her from touring. ",

If we exclude military bands and keep to popular type bands (including the genres above. here are some. Rolling Stones - 1962 (Wiki) Fairport Convention - 1967 Canned Heat - 1965 (not sure if they are still performing) Beach Boys - 1961 (not sure if they are still performing The Who - 1964 I would have to do some research to find others - memory is not what it used to be.
