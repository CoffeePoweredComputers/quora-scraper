            "answer_text": "Hmm. A variety of genres but it really depends like always. With main stream culture embracing dance music more you find that in pop music more and more. Beyond that some of those dance culture DJs are actually making rock music of a slight variation that\u2019s being classified as alternative. For the most part mumble rap is still dominating most of the mainstream hip hop charts and that\u2019s a lot of what younger gens get exposed to on their journey to find what sound agrees with them. In dance/party cultures genres are blending for sure and lines are almost impossible to find but for the past decade or so bass music has dominated in the USA. I have no complaints to that since it\u2019s my bread and butter. Dubstep has evolved to the point where it\u2019s no just a tiny piece of its own genre. Deathstep is pretty popular, as well as Vomitstep (created and made popular by Snails). Riddim is dominating for sure. All of those sub genres are much much harder and darker than the original dubstep. Bass music isn\u2019t the only genre getting darker. We\u2019ve seen the birth of Dark Disco and what I call Death House. Bass house has completely taken over most things. A small small sub genre called speed house is struggling to make a place for itself. Rock is almost stagnant. It\u2019s not progressing very far but in almost all it\u2019s variations it carries a slight emo vibe with it in my opinion. Hope that helps. Ask if you\u2019d like some artists of any genre for examples ",
