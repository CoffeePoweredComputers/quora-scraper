            "answer_text": "The top 3 ROCK bands that come to my mind are; 1-the James Gang. Joe Walsh has been referred to as the greatest American guitarist and I won't argue. His work on the bomber was phenomenal blending guitar versions of classical tunes (Bolero and Cast Your Fate to the Wind) into a hard rock song was magical. I remember when the James gang Rides Again came out I bought a copy and we would listen to it over and over again. Naturally with adult beverages involved and using a phonograph with a needle the first copy I had quickly got scratched beyond hope so I went out and bought another just a few months later but something seemed different. Eventually I found out that they had never gotten permission to use the licks from Bolero so the record company had to go out and pull all of the existing copies out of the record stores and replace them with new copies that had Bolero removed. I was devastated. They did get the matter settled and you were able to get the original copy that included bolero. My life was so much better after that. 2-ZZ Top. The video of Legs was the song that really seemed to launch them but Stages is the jam that I really got hooked on Billy Gibbons style. I never saw them live but wish I would have. It's a hole in my life that maybe someday I will fill. 3-Grand Funk Railroad. Before they hit it big my brother had told me he had seen this new group playing at a small gig and the guitar player was wild as hell running all over the stage and firing up the crowd. It was less than a year later that they did hit it big and I went to see them at a sold-out Arena. My brother was right. Mark Farner was going a mile a minute all over the stage. His energy was over the top. I know they were criticized by the music world experts as being one-dimensional and shallow and many radio stations wouldn't play their cuts but even without support from the industry they were selling out major Arenas all over the country. They are best known for I'm your Captain which is a classic but they had a lot of other tunes that rocked, especially if you saw them live. Loneliness was another powerful song that blended orchestra instruments into it and still one of my favs. ",

            "answer_text": "There will be a lot of different answers to this question, simply because of the old axiom \u201cdifferent strokes for different folks\u201d. However, for me, I would say that the best 3 piece rock band of all time would be GFR, Grand Funk Railroad. NOT the GFR of the era that put out \u201cThe Locomotion\u201d. Rather the GFR much before that. Mark Farner on guitars, keyboards, harmonica and lead vocals; Mel Schacher on bass; and Don Brewer on drums and also contributing lead vocals. This threesome put out some of the heaviest and groove heavy rock of the \u201870s. And, in my opinion much of their early catalogue still stands up to repeated listening today. My personal favourite is the classic \u201cI\u2019m Your Captain (Closer to Home). But there are so many other great tunes by GFR to check out. Close second for me is \u201cAre You Ready\u201d which kicks off the 1970 Grand Funk Live album. Some other favourite GFR tunes of mine are: Footstompin\u2019 Music; Mark Say\u2019s Alright, T.N.U.C; Into the Sun; I Come Tumblin\u2019; Sin\u2019s A Good Mans\u2019 Brother; Flight of the Phoenix, and a total KICKASS cover of the Stone\u2019s \u201cGimme Shelter\u201d! There are more good GFR tunes, but\u2026by the 7th album, they added a 4th member, so those later albums are disqualified in terms of the \u201cbest 3 piece band of all time\u201d. If you want a real taste of the band, check out Youtube for Grand Funk - Live 1974 (From Japanese LaserDisc). It will give you a good idea of the band\u2019s musicianship and their ability to really rock! Anyhow, that\u2019s my opinion. I really do encourage anyone that is not that familiar with Grand Funk Railroad, give them a listen. And then ask yourself, how is GFR NOT in the Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Hall of Fame!?!?!? ",
