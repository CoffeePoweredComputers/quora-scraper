I don't know if they fit your definition of \u201cband\u201d a la drums, lead guitar, bass, etc, but they were a successful musical group. Oh, now that I am typing, some \u201creal bands\u201d (see above parameters) example could be the The Arctic Monkeys, Alice in Chains, Alabama, America, The Animals, and Animal Collective. I am just thinking of groups off the top of my head. I am sure there are a lot more. ",
