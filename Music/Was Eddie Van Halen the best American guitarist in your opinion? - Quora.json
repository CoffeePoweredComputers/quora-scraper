            "answer_text": "In terms of \u2018greatness\u2019, as in influence, impact and popularity regardless of my personal taste, he was one of the most greatest rock guitarists of all time. I wouldn\u2019t put him at the very top, because Jimi Hendrix was more influential still. I would place him third behind Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton (who was English). Especially through popularising the tapping the technique, Eddie Van Halen really raised the bar on how fast guitarists could physically play. This was hugely influential on the various heavy metal and shred guitarists from the 1980s onwards. But unlike those bands, Van Halen had a far more mainstream fanbase. As for my personal taste, I have tended to be more interested in melodic players like David Gilmour, but I enjoy Van Halen. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I would say no. As far as rock/blues style guitarists go, I think Jimi Hendrix ranks higher than Van Halen, and I could see Stevie Ray Vaughan being placed higher as well. Everybody has their own opinions though, so there are definitely some who would put Eddie at number one. There are plenty of American guitarists in other genres that I would place above Eddie, like Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, Charlie Christian, and Chet Atkins, to name a few. ",
