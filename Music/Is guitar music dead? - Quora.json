            "answer_text": "I would not say it\u2019s dead because there are a lot of bands still playing guitars that are succesful. What I would say is that it\u2019s not mainstream anymore. Yes, maybe back in the 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s it would be considered otherwise, but right now it looks like most people are interested in other genres like electronic music or reggaeton. Of course, this is not the case in every country. I\u2019m pretty sure it will change in the near future, though. I have seen that there are a lot of new bands coming up that are focusing on older styles like glam rock (one of my favorites, btw). You should check Reckless Love for example:  \u2026or Steel Panther, of course:  This brings my hopes up that we\u2019ll see a guitar-band comeback in the near future. Bow down, infidels! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, in a sense that the average young kid still yearns to play guitar, yes. My kids are middle school age and they have no interest in my music. (Or any music played with instruments) When I was 10 I used to salivate over electric guitars in the sears catalog. Guitarists are dying off and not being replaced. Go to a bar that features live music. I guarantee that on stage there will be musicians no younger than 45, playing music from 40 years ago and getting paid the same money they got paid 30 years ago. If you have any highly priced collectible guitars lying around, I suggest selling them now. I did just that a few years ago. I kept just the ones I play regularly. And if you think I'm wrong, and guitar music is going to come back someday, I have an accordion I'd like to sell you. ",
