            "answer_text": "Less people told them to train their voices for speaking and singing. It is a quite different pair of shoes. So thanks to Kevin! Actually this was \u2018a little\u2019 short and cynical. Voice actors have to dub personalities with their natural habits.What they do is acting like being behind a magnifier-glass. So every unnecessary amplifying or beautifying is not wanted.Classical singers have to amplify their voice by well coordinated vocal functions and well formed vowels. So often directors don\u2019t like working with them because of their sometimes unnatural habits.Pop singers a little less ( crooning, fainted voice etc). Good ones have many classical skills. If they have a classical education, critics often write: \u2018He/she oversings\u2019.Stage actors are needing amplifying skills as well. American stage actors in many generations had, as I know, this three way education (acting, singing, dancing). Many of them are doing movies and voice acting too.The good guys under the voice actors had a good voice education for singing and voice acting and stage acting.So I guess, that the flood of Netflix or similar productions creates a lot of not so well trained so called voice actors.

            "answer_text": "Some actors can sing, some singers can act but not all of them can do both. Both skills require years of learning & practicing to master. Then there are wrong ways to sing, not all singers can sing properly let alone someone who sings as a secondary profession. And some parts don\u2019t require the actor to sing well. Their job is acting after all, not singing. ",
