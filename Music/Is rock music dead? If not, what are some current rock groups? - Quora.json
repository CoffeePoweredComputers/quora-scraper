            "answer_text": "No, it isnt dead but it is a shell of its former self. To explain it you have to go back to its 50s origins. Rock was born at a time of conservative revival in the US after WWII exposed the world to the failures and horrors of liberal New Deal, fascism and communism. Back in those days you couldn\u2019t be black or gay without being discriminated against or lynched. However the youth of the time were defying their wartime parents by hanging with these crowds. Its important to note that this was illegal at the time due to segregation laws. Amongst this crowd was the \u201cBlack music\u201d of the era. Jazz, Blues and Country over time fused together into Rock N Roll. Well, the parents caught wind of this new music and considered it to be a destructive influence on the youth and society even going so far as having Bible Belt pastors deeming it satanic. This was all because it defied the conservative culture.  Little Richard in particular was considered to be especially evil due to his flamboyant almost homosexual persona and highly sexual lyrics. In fact he was the poster child for controversy. In response they propped up Elvis Presley (a white man) as the face of Rock N Roll. However the latter was far more tame than the former. If there was to be boundary pushing music to thrive there had to be a counterculture, and then came the 60s.  In the early 60s Rock almost died when Buddy Holly and The Crickets were all killed in a plane crash. However this was in America. Luckily for us Rock fans there was a band from Liverpool UK that was fast becoming the new wave of Rock N Roll. This ended up becoming the British Invasion and many great bands such as The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks joining them in leading the charge for a new era in Rock focused on boundary pushing music, bold style, dangerous attitude and raw sexuality. Everything was about being cool and rebellious. Oddly enough this music thrived in the UK without much backlash from conservatives but in America things were turning ugly. JFK was assassinated, Vietnam was raging, race riots were beginning to occur and distrust in the government was at an all time high. The biggest and most important element of this new counterculture was the generational divide. No longer were teenagers buying Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, they were buying the Stones and The Beatles. Suddenly Rock music had a firm grip on the youth culture and when the hippie movement, new age spirituality and LSD came into the picture, Rock diversified and led to Psychadelic Rock, Acid Rock and Prog.  This was huge in the US and it garnered huge backlash from conservatives and as the counterculture grew the band that became the face of American counterculture were The Doors and Jim Morrison. Jim in particular had all the elements of the counterculture with his rebellious lyrics and imagery and Dionysian persona. However as The Doors grew the failings of the counterculture was showing itself through Morrisons antics, the deaths of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Mansons Helter Skelter and the election of Richard Nixon. Then in 1970 out of Birmingham England a new genre was created by a local band named Black Sabbath, this genre was called Heavy Metal  This music was a complete rejection of the hippie counterculture seeing it as nothing more than a pipe dream. It was heavy, it was bleak and most importantly it was relevant. Margaret Thatcher became the new British PM and the threat of nuclear war was more prevalent than ever. However while Black Sabbath had something to say, most of the Rock scene in the 70s was focused on extreme technical ability and hedonistic pursuits. Enter Punk  Punk was aggressive, in your face with fiercely leftist tunes about anarchy and youthful disobedience. Songs like God Save The Queen were a complete rejection of the establishment and garnered censorship from the BBC and condemnation from the government itself. However this would not last as the simplicity of the music meant that it all became very homogeneous and boring. As a result Punk became New Wave which dominated the early 80s. With Ronald Reagan winning the 1980 US election this rebirth in conservatism led to a rejection of the very ideology which allowed Punk to thrive and now allowed New Wave to be played in shopping malls across every city. It was safe, it was clean and it was pop music with synths instead of guitars. Thus began the first cause of Rock\u2019s demise: new technology.  Meanwhile Heavy Metal was evolving and becoming bigger, bolder and more creative. Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin were now old cats who were in a creative slump. Now bands such as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Dio were leading the charge with fantasy inspired album covers, grand stage shows, flashy clothing and classical shred. In the States however the LA scene took it one step further with Glam Rock and Punk thrown in with Metal. Thus began the Hair Metal scene which led Heavy Metal to overtake New Wave as the biggest genre in the West during the mid to late 80s. In response to this, a committee run by bored pearl clutching housewives called the PMRC was formed. At the time this was the most aggressive attack on Rock ever to have happened. Bands such as WASP, Motley Crue and Twisted Sister faced censorship and even outright bans. Many of them in fact stated their case before congress before the parental advisory stickers were issued as a compromise. However the second cause of Rock\u2019s demise was becoming more obvious: the increasing corporatism, materialism and hedonism. Rock founded itself on core values of authenticity and anti establishment. Now, Rock was the establishment leading a trio of Seattle teenagers called Nirvana to become the new generation of Rock music this was called Grunge and it was a total rejection of the larger than life persona of all previous eras of Rock. Although vastly more authentic, this in my opinion was one of the biggest and most damaging cause of Rocks demise in the 90s. Basically Rock went from this:  To this:  Gone was the high energy, gone was the sense of style and gone were the groupies and gone were the solos. Now every Rock musician was just like you and how boring is that. Rock needed something larger than life again. Rock needed a new rockstar and then along came Marilyn Manson. Marilyn Manson was dangerous, he had an over the top gothic/glam appearance, he was wild and surprisingly his biggest strength proved to be that he was an intellectual. At the time the Christian Right became a highly powerful group of evangelical nutjobs with political influence and Marilyn Manson was public enemy #1 alongside the likes of Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein. Manson could hold his own against the likes of Fox News effortlessly and became a voice for a generation of unheard kids. Also a new subgenre of Metal was created titled Nu Metal influenced by Hip Hop and Grunge, with bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn being the big names in the genre. However this music proved to be far too violent and nihilistic and this led to four major events that were the nails in the coffin for Rock. The first was the Columbine Shootings for which Marilyn Manson and multiple other bands were scapegoated as having inspired the shootings. The second was Woodstock 99 in which Limp Bizkit incited a riot where multiple teens were assaulted and raped. The third and by far the biggest cause of Rocks demise was 911. Let me explain. After 911, a radio conglomerate called the Clear Channel created the Clear Channel memorandum. This banned many songs to be played on radio which unfortunately had a very anti-Rock bias. You want to know who they became?  iHeart fucking Radio, the people who forced Green Day to get off stage for Justin Bieber. I can almost guarantee these people were the ones who pushed the labels to kick Rock out of the mainstream under the authority of the Bush administration. We kept up the good fight but in the end the conservatives destroyed the last true bastion of rebellion and authenticity. Now all we have is boring, bland hipster bands who have nothing to say and no ability to create original music, instead ripping off older bands and passing it off as original. Also because of social media, having actual talent is no longer required and materialism and narcissistic behaviour is a virtue aka the Kardashians. This is why Mumble Rap, EDM and modern Pop thrives because it embodies the degeneracy and excesses of our hypercapitalist society. Now these genres have lost their authenticity and ridiculous just like Rock did in the 80s. Despite this, some of the actually talented and authentic artists in the Pop and Hip Hop game such as Billie Eilish, Post Malone, Machine Gun Kelly and Yungblud have brought more awareness to Rock, Punk and Metal through being fans of said genres, doing collaborations with the likes of Ozzy Osbourne and/or incorporating electric guitars in their music. This has allowed many young teenagers who aren\u2019t much into Rock becoming big fans and even devoting entire reaction channels to the old school bands. If anything this is a good thing which I hope will inspire the youth to pick up an instrument and form a band. The problem is that record labels dont really sign any new bands. I think this is largely on the bands not being bold enough in their music and style and their lack of star potential. So now I am going to list some more recent bands who I think carry the traits mentioned and I believe are the future of the genre Avenged Sevenfold- The oldest of the bunch but are the leading face of American Heavy Metal. A modern take on old school Hard Rock and Metal Ghost- A bit more pop inspired than most others on this list. They make up for this with pure retro macabre with just enough originality to not sound like a novelty act. Thunderpussy- These ladies pride themselves as being lesbian bikers with a love for beautiful women and a big bottle of Jack Daniels. Pure Rock N Roll attitude with a twist Greta Van Fleet- I know these guys get a lot of flack for being too similar to Led Zeppelin but hey they are the biggest new Hard Rock band and they deserve to be on this list. They are the ones carrying the torch Halestorm- Lzzy Hale alone is worthy of respect for her passion for the genre. Their sound is also some of the best in the business Black Veil Brides- These guys have it all. Look, sound and attitude. Nothing more to say The Struts- These guys are the epitome of cool not seen since the Stones and their songs are worth the time any day of the week \\m/ \\m/ ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldnt say dead but its more underground now. There are very few true rock artists that are being discovered today and the reason being is simple\u2026.MONEY. Ever since file sharing, Youtube, Pandora etc etc , record companies are NOT making the money they used to make pre internet. Because of this record labels are no longer willing to take a chance on a genre that has seen better days. Instead, they are looking at more \u201cbankable\u201d stars in the 3 main genres that are still around\u2026country, pop and rap. The difference being is that most of the artists you see today are manufactured by the label. Pop and rap stars now sing songs that were written for them by a group of song writers, look the way the label feels they should look, will only be interviewed in a \u201csafe\u201d environment by reporters who toss \u201csoftball questions\u201d at them, go to specific events that the record labels feel will get them the most exposure etc. Sadly though when you hear a song by a pop or rap artist, its a song that could be sang by any artist and you wouldn't know the difference. Back when rock ruled the airwaves you KNEW who the band and singer were once you heard the guitar riff or the vocalists distinct vocal style. A song that Motley Crue performed couldnt be performed realistically by, lets say, the Foo Fighters, Led Zep etc. The main reason being is that most artists back then wrote their own music. The internet has become a double edged sword now. Yes its great to be able to hear your favorite song anytime for free. Before the internet you either bought the CD, Album, Cassette, etc, recorded the song off the radio (if you were lucky enough to and were quick enough) or you taped off a friends copy of said CD. Rock wont be as big as it once was because most rock artists dont like being told what to do. They dont like being told what to wear, what to write, what events to go to etc. Plus most rock bands wont record a song that someone else had written for them, especially if that song was designed for radio airplay and did not represent the band.
