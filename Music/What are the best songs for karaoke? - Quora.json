            "answer_text": "My introduction to karaoke was in Tennessee, where there was a LOT of country in the karaoke catalogue.  Yee-haw.  And country music is fantastic for karaoke. There's usually a slightly slower tempo which means that you can follow the words on screen a bit easier and because of it's folk traditions - it usually (but not always) sits in a normal vocal range for most people. And some of them are almost spoken rather than sung - so anyone can do it.  Depending on your audience, you can play it straight or you can play it ironic. I love 'Stand By Your Man' - it's not actually the easiest song, but the words are easy to recall unless you're v. v. drunk (one shameful episode in San Francisco I dimly remember)  but if you crack a little bit it tends to add emotion.  I personally love Mary Chapin Carpenter's Passionate Kisses.  And I've won a prize for 'Jolene'  Since I'm a southerner, I can bring up the right accent which works a treat for UK audiences.  Best karaoke I've ever seen though was a 6 foot tranny and a goth hooker singing \"Good Ship Lollipop\" in a dive bar in Knoxville, followed by Riders in the Sky from a guy with a surprisingly good bass.  I've always wanted to duet on \"Jackson\" (Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash)  - but I've yet to see it in a catalogue.  Scariest (but also fun!) was singing Battle of New Orleans with a Texan in a scary, scary bar near a dog track in the South London.  There really isn't a more antagonistic song an American could sing to a British audience. But whatever you do, don't sing karaoke in Sheffield! Those people take it SERIOUSLY.  They are good, like better than people in the charts.  Just sit back and enjoy if you ever find yourself on a karaoke night in Sheffield. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the crowd, your singing ability, your connection to the song and the overall sobriety of the audience. You being drunk doesn't make you a better singer.  However a drunken audience will make you a better singer.  ;-) Up-tempo songs where everyone knows the lyrics are good.  Ballads/slow songs are only good if you have a really good voice and are emotionally connected to the song. Gimmick songs will bring smiles and might get you free drinks cuz someone had never heard that song before and think it's awesome. \"Brown Eyed Girl\", \"Margaritaville\", \"Why Don't We Get Drunk And Screw\" and almost any Neil Diamond or Elvis song are all good songs for guys that audiences will enjoy. Unless you sound just like him, please do not ever sing songs made famous by Frank Sinatra.  Too cliche unless you can *nail* it. My personal 'standby' is \"Secret Agent Man\".  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNve8dMRHKE  (note the exit in the background--I always like to know where those are in case I'm really, really bad) Of course, if you can REALLY sing, you can sing the alphabet in Croatian and the audience will love it, so song choice doesn't really matter.  And ultimately...you're singing for yourself and to have fun, so who cares what others think?  They can always have another drink and you'll sound better.  :-) ",
