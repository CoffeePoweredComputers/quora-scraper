            "answer_text": "This is going to be a very objective and informed ranking. Note Mamamoo does not have any main/lead positions and all members more or less do everything an idol group does. Vocals Wheein > Hwasa > Solar > Moonbyul Wheein has a natural talent for singing and although her range is not as grandiose and obvious as the others, she is the strongest technique wise. Her ability to change key in the middle of a high note or switch from head to chest voice so effortlessly is remarkable. Her voice would come across breathy and soft but she can belt with the best and reach high whistle notes. Hwasa comes a close second naturally and her more unique jazzy tone adds to her appeal as a singer. Her falsetoo high notes are heavenly. She also has a more breathy approach when she's singing and prefers a mid to low range tone. Solar's vocal ability, as gifted as she is, comes more from hardwork. But my god, her range from high to low registers (her lower tones make panties drop ngl). Her voice can fit any type, genre, concept, tempo of music. She's incredibly versatile and though she gets a lot of the high notes, you can note her different styles in songs like Egotistic and Temptation (her cover). Moonbyul isn't as naturally gifted as Wheesa and had to stop vocal training so didn't get the chance to improve as much as we all would have loved for her. But since 2018 she's been getting more vocal parts and more confidence. Her harmonising with the others have been accentuated alot more. She has higher notes on a few of her covers and recently their song Ten Nights from their new album (check it out). Rap Moonbyul > Hwasa > Solar & Wheein Moonbyul undoubtedly received the most rap training and her unique delivery in different kinds of songs always shows the emotion and meaning she puts in her rap parts and lyrics. Her melodic flow with different tempos and her versatility shines. Hwasa's newer fans know her more of a singer but as an official rapper of Mamamoo whose diss track (I do me) dropped when she was just 20, don't slack off on her rapping skills. She has a more aggressive tone to rapping than Moonbyul whose usually smooth and melodic and her lyrics are so witty and ingenious. Solar & Wheein, the unofficial rappers probably rap more than the official rappers in Varieties. MC DdukDdak, as their new stage name (check out their latest idol radio) is a hit. I put them together because their skills are quite similar plus we can't take it too seriously as we don't see that much of them officially but if they were to rap in a feature I know Solar would ace it as she does all styles of music and Wheein's natural rhythm would be perfect. Dance This is quite difficult because you have to consider their freestyle/natural dancing and their choreography dancing. Also they all have different dancing styles and preferences. Choreography Wheein > Hwasa & Moonbyul > Solar Freestyle Moonbyul & Wheein & Hwasa > Solar Overall Analysis (Solar I'm sorry) Wheein grasps choreography the fastest and can fit the spectrum of dance styles that range from Moonbyul\u2019s smooth footwork, Hwasa sexy hip movements and Solar\u2019s \u201cwhatever I feel like\u201d dancing during freestyle so she fits well with whatever each other member comes up with. Hwasa\u2019s stage presence and charisma usually outshines her choreography skills but as more of their choreo is fluid and less hard hitting, she embodies it and just enjoys herself. But if you look at her Twit stages you'll appreciate more how great a dancer she is. I put Moonbyul and Hwasa together because they both excel more on in solo dances where they are able to express their preference without being confined to choreographed group dances. That being said, Moonbyul does really well when the dance is more rigid and hard hitting added with her smooth footwork. Solar (my heart \u2665) takes longer to learn choreography and tends to be the black hole but when she nails it, it looks incredibly good. She's also one that would forsake the choreography for charismatic and fun stage manners. Her natural dancing is honestly anything goes. She tries to learn the cool hip moves but it just looks funny when she does it. She would stick to more fluid and sexier dances like Hwasa than hip hop, rigid smooth dancing that Wheein and Moonbyul do. Visuals Firstly, we don't rank visuals in this house. Mamamoo isn't just unique from other groups but the members are unique from each other. So I'm just going to leave these and you decide how bad you got wrecked by each member     Variety Skills There are two ways I access this: Doing a variety of things shamelessly for the fun of it with or without successDoing a variety of things as asked and doing it successfullyFor 1. Solar > Wheein > Moonbyul > Hwasa Solar\u2019s variety doesn't have skills \u314b\u314b but she's entertaining and hardworking and will always put on a show and attempt something whether she's good at it or not. For 2. Moonbyul > Wheein > Hwasa > Solar I'm variety shows, Moonbyul does what she's told almost immediately and is embarrassed afterwords (it's adorable) but when it comes to skills of pointless variety things, she's the queen. There's a compilation on YouTube about her being good at random things Hope this suited the ranking criterias \u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "VOCALS Wheein - Vocal range supported (G#3 to C#5). She has the healthiest technique allowing easier transition. She also has the most balance mix out of all the members due to her vocal control in lower, upper, and mixed register. Wheein can achieve G5 with falsetto with consistency. However, her runs are a bit sloppy and random.Solar - Vocal range supported (A3 - C#5). Great vocal control similar to Wheein. But, her mixed register tends to be a bit strained and noticeably unrelaxed. Solar achieves D5 through belting coming off strained and yelled. Her runs are also sloppy with no musical direction. Her high notes tend to be more popular due to her vocal texture.Hwasa - Vocal range supported (A3 - C5). Lower register has great support while her upper register tend to be extremely airy and disconnected. Her mixed register is chesty and really unbalanced but is able to achieve C5 with resonance. Her runs are extremely inconsistent due to lack of precision and accuracy. She can sometimes execute it with clear intentions or it can sound mushed up notes.Moonbyul - I\u2019m not really sure about her vocal range as she does not sing enough for me to see her consistent results, but I know she can also sing contrary to popular belief.RAP (Don\u2019t know much about technicalities) MoonbyulHwasaSolar and WheeinDANCE Wheein - She is able to execute the dance routine with great accuracy. Her attention to detail is greater than her members most notecieably shown in \u201cGogobebe,\u201d \u201cGleam,\u201d and \u201cHip.\u201d She can also dance to any type of dance routine without changing the base forms allowing and accurate representation of emotion intended to be expressed. She can control well how much intensity should be applied and her footwork is well thought-out allowing a smoother and connected transition from each move she makes. I suggest watching \u201cBe like me,\u201d \u201cLo lo,\u201d and \u201cRunaway\u201d and compare her dance steps with BAEK the choreographer. Then, watch \u201cTitle.\u201d Her range is limitless as she can achieve any type of genre due to her good basics and execution.Moonbyul - Contrary to popular belief, she is not close to Wheein\u2019s dance skills. But, she is still a good dancer. She can follow the routine with no difficulties. Byul\u2019s transition is on the disconnected side but it usually works on plain sight. However, her versatility is compromised. She tend to change the base form to fit either her taste or comfort. In singing, it is like changing the lyrics as it will not match the intended expression. This tends to be cover-up by swag which usually works with casual fans who are not dancers. She will have wider options of genre if she were to fix her basics and remove barriers of preference as she is already a good dancer.Hwasa - Similarly to Moonbyul, she tends to cover up her lack of accuracy with confident vibe. Her versatility is likely compromised by her skill rather than taste or comfort. Her strongest part is her hip which can be seen largely used in her solos. Watching \u201cGleam\u201d and \u201cGogobebe,\u201d you will notice how her upper body tend to be stiff. Although she can perform and memorize dance routines quickly, she cannot perform them with great precision or accuracy. Her footwork and force application tend to be inconsistent.Solar - She tends to have a hard time memorizing dance routines as shown in their practice videos. Opposite to Hwasa, her strongest part is her upper body. Her lower body is on the stiffer side. Her foot work is also not that great, and her transition is disconnected. She does a pretty average job in dancing which is acceptable in her line of work as an idol. She can do the routine requested, but the small details wont be achieved.VARIETY SolarHwasaMoonbyulWheeinEDIT: I know most won't agree on my variety skills list, but I just put it based on confidence which I think is the key. Wheein is honestly the funniest out of all of them but she cant do the same when she\u2019s with other people. VISUAL WE DONT RANK THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL STUNNING IN THEIR OWN DIFFERENT WAY. ",
