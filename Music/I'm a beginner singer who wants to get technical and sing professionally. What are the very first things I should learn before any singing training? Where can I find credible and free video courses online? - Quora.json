            "answer_text": "You may think that you're stuck with the voice you have, but this isn't true. You can actually change the way your singing sounds today and end up singing better than ever. Sound too good to be true? Well, it's not. Think of it this way. Let's say you want to build muscle in your triceps. You don't like the way your arms look. After checking out a few youtube videos, or getting tips from a body-builder, it's clear that you can change the appearance of your arms by consistently working on certain exercises. You may need to make some changes in your diet as well, but the exercises are mandatory. Now, it wouldn't make sense to exercise your thighs if you want to concentrate on your arms. It's the same with the voice. Specific exercises geared to develop areas of the voice are essential to better singing. If singing on key is a weakness, it makes no sense to work on developing vibrato. How is vibrato going to help to carry a tune? Several factors are necessary when it comes to singing with a better voice, depending on what your present strengths are as well as your weaknesses. It's important to focus on the exact areas that need development. Make it a habit to always warm up your voice before singing. Warm-ups not only prepare your voice to sing better, they also help to prevent vocal damage. Warming up your voice will get you ready for singing challenges, resulting in a happier and healthy voice. I can't possibly cover everything here but will introduce a few vocal techniques (skills) to help you to sound better (and in some cases) much better than you do now.

            "answer_text": "Most anyone who teaches voice and knows what they are doing is going to want and need [to eat] to be paid for it. If you really want to get down to it, nothing is going to do it but an actual, one on one with a trained teacher. My teacher is not just a university trained musician, but a trained music educator. She could teach school if she wanted to. it's really important that you work with a teacher with real credentials, I could hang out a shingle, or run an ad, or start up a website. At least where I live, there is no regulation whatsoever, and a bad teacher can mess you up as badly as a good one can help you. There's lots of sites where you can check out what they offer. Maybe it's legit, perhaps not so much. If you have a teacher who knows what is what, you can screen stuff through that teacher, and get a little free knowledge, but basically, you get what you pay for, and whatever you get is worth about what you paid for it.
