            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Vikas Kundu. IMHO, this question itself is very flawed. It would depend on many factors. Firstly, what is your singing pitch like? Don't be overambitious and attempt things beyond your control. My only advice when it comes to singing: don't do it for others, don't do it to impress. Do it from the heart. Do it for yourself, and from \"within yourself\". I have been practicing my singing since 2010 (Had a quick crash course, with a Swiss professor, between 2008 and 2010, but nothing great). One thing I realized is that, when you start singing \"for the sake of  others\", you tend to get lost in those perceptions. To ambiguously paraphrase a dialog from Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar (2011): Real music comes from the heart. It can be a broken heart, a happy heart... but it should come from within. You should be inspired enough. I used to croak like a frog. Now, with practice practice and more practice, I can manage easy songs on a guitar. To keep it short: any song you feel deeply attached to. A song you can relate to. And a song that makes you forget everything, and that comes from within your soul. All the best! Kill it! :-) ",

So, before preparing for auditioning you must have your voice tested (musically, of course) by a music teacher/ guru. It should be only then that you go looking for a suitable song as per your voice quality, range, vocal abilities, control over the throw of your voice and rest.If you are already taking music classes, you should understand the basic intricacies needed to have in your voice to sing beautifully. For an overall idea, prepare atleast 3 songs: A song based on classical musicSoft-romantic/ melancholic numberFast or funky songI hope it helps. All the best! :) ",

If you are good with high notes and want to up your game as compared to other contestants then my friend you should try Abhi mujhe me Kahi - Agnipath ( shows your strength to convey emotions and show off your accelerating pitch) Teri Diwani - Kailash Kher ( gives a variety of pitch most judges mostly looks for) Gulati aakhen- ( most guitarists already sung it unplugged but last couple of years I have not seen anybody sing it in auditions hence it would be refreshing for judges to hear this in auditions and being able to judge you for this particular song) Imran Hashmi Movie Songs are good Choice Old Songs by Kishor Kumar ji or Gajal by late.Jagjeet Singh ji or a playful song by Udit Narayan Ji may just do the trick.
