            "answer_text": "Yes, although I\u2019m not sure when the term \u201cpopular music\u201d first appeared The term \u201cclassical music\u201d first appeared in the early 19th century. It referred specifically to the music of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and a few other acknowledged masters who wrote similar music\u2014similar meaning music that revealed new charm and beauty with every hearing. Rossini didn\u2019t qualify. A French writer claimed that there were two kinds of musicians: classicists and Rossinists. By that time, only Beethoven was still alive of the classical triumvirate. Certain political and economic conditions\u2014particularly the French Revolution\u2014caused concert life to cease or become seriously curtailed in Europe\u2019s major musical capitals for 20 years or more. No one followed in Beethoven\u2019s footsteps. Why bother, since there was no way to get performances? Only connoisseurs appreciated it, anyway. The mass public preferred music they could grasp at first hearing. And they always wanted to hear something new. With no concert halls, they could still hear novelties at the opera house. Rossini never completed his musical education, but he knew how to appeal to a mass audience. Classical music lovers despised his operas. Meyerbeer\u2019s, too, and for the same reason. It all sounded alike and did not repay repeated hearing. The wealthy segment of the mass audience opened their homes to popular piano soloists and invited an audience to hear them in their salons. Most of the pianists were more businessmen than musicians. They specialized in flashy, showy music. They wrote hundreds of variations on well known songs and operatic arias, and a lot of dance music and other short, uncomplicated pieces. Then they published versions easy enough for amateurs to play and made a killing from selling sheet music. Classical music lovers hated that music, too. Robert Schumann established a music magazine partly so he could write about how much he hated the music of the \u201cPhilistines.\u201d Like Rossini and most of the popular pianists. But he recognized that some of them wrote substantial, worthwhile music. Like Chopin and Liszt. By that time, concert orchestras that could play the music of the masters had come back. Schumann and his generation of composers wrote music modeled on the music of the masters. The \u201cclassical\u201d repertoire began to grow. Eventually Liszt moved on from the flash and dazzle of his earliest music. Rossini\u2019s overtures (but not the operas) became acceptable to the classical music audience. Closer to our own time, Gershwin wrote songs for Tin Pan Alley, the centerpiece of the American popular music industry. He also wrote an opera and some orchestral pieces. Audiences liked them and still do. But it is only recently that critics have begun to admit that Gershwin\u2019s music deserves comparison with Stravinsky, Bartok, and other composers of his time untainted by association with popular music.

            "answer_text": "It is an interesting question as what we call \u201cclassical music\u201d is very much an interpretive thing and quite different to what one might call the Classical period. For me, personally, I consider a lot of today's music \u201cclassical music\u201d; that is to say my defintion is, to a degree, one which encompasses music that utilises, but not limited to, classically taught techniques. Contemporary and experimental techniques are also included. To be quite honest, to truly explain what I define \u201cclassical music\u201d is not quite possible at this time as I do not know fully myself. I should perhaps examine why I think something classical music when I do and come to a conclusion of my definition. But that is besides the point. It is subjective. It is quite difficult to say as a whole whether or not the classical music of the time, or contemporary music of the time should I say, was considered popular. That is to say that there is just so much that a generalisation would be just as good as a blind answer. Certainly there are pieces which, upon their premiere, were widely popular and appreciated from the get go. These are usually from composers who have already made a name for themselves, or at least have some standing. Rachmaninoff, for instance, premiered his piano concerto No.2 and was instantly a hit. Everyone loved it despite it not being his usual idiom, but that is besides the point. However, that concerto was written in dedication to Rachmaninoff\u2019s therapist who helped him get out of a, I think, two year depression. The depression was due to a failed premiere of his first symphony, again, I think, this was down to a drunk conductor. It was not popular at all. I want to go back further and talk about Liszt,Beethoven, Mozart, Vivaldi, Bach, and whatnot but I feel my answers to those will not be as informed. I am starting to wonder if my answer has added anything has, great! I may edit this at a later date to incorporate them. ",
