            "answer_text": "why would you want to? The DRM on audible is fairly innocuous. They can be played on any major desktop OS (Windows and Mac), as well as all major mobile platforms. Audible has a mobile app for iOS, Android, and even Windows Mobile (and NOBODY supports Windows Mobile). The mobile app allows you access to your entire audiobook library in the cloud at all times (network and data fees not withstanding). If you care, the app even allows you to track your own use patterns. Now, assuming you still need/want to for whatever reason, the simplest is of course the analog audio playback weakness. Play the audiobook over a speaker next to a microphone that re-records the audio as an unprotected format (this works for any DRM audio). A little trickier would be to use something like audiohijack, to do the same trick electronically. Downside to both of these is that a 50 hour audiobook would take 50 hours to convert. Unfortunately for those looking to speed up the process, there is not another way. The drm for audible is, as far as I know, unique to them. It is such a small nitch, and the customers are so unconcerned with it, that no one has bothered to crack it. If you have to have DRM, then this is how it should be done. Lightweight, and largely unseen by the user. Thus removing the incentive for it to be cracked in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "Before I tell you the free \u201cand\u201d best way to strip DRM from audible audiobooks I want you to read this: Is it illegal to remove DRM from audiobooks purchased from Audible? There are software tools which can remove DRM from your audiobooks but quality comes at a price. All free tools do a very poor job or audio conversion. The output quality is very poor. If you have already invested into $15-$30 for audible subscription, and want to store audiobooks to listen in a different device, investing $15 on a good audible converter will not be wasted. It can strip DRM, Convert different formats to one another and give a better peace of mind. Still, if you want, you can test M4VGear or Requiem which are free tools but not actively maintained by the developers. (People need money to produce). Another way to remove DRM from audiobooks is to use a recorder. Record audiobooks and save them in the format you like. This way, you don\u2019t need to break jails to get what you want. ",
