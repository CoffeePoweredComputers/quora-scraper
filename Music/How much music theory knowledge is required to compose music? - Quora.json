            "answer_text": "The \u201c natural composer\u201d may or may not get \u201c help\u201d Irving Berlin was forced to sing for small change as a young boy. He found himself to be a good organizer and started his own company to publish songs in sheet music about 100 years ago. He could heat melody dies n his head and could just about pick up a tune with one finger on a piano that changed key by moving the keyboard and using mostly black notes.He seemed to be able to recognize chords for his tunes but could not name or play them So he employed other musicians to write down his tunes. They would then give him choices for each chord. But as they were musicians they would only play obviously present chords that fit the tune. When Berlin heard the chord he liked , he would agree . So was Berlin composing a chord progression? Or was the secretary doing it? We will never know! One thing is pretty sure If he had not been able to use a guy to play them and write down,they would not exist due to technical considerations! Paul McCartney is a natural musician who also had help from Heorge Martin to polish his ideas and get them recorded. Some tunes like yesterday have been recorded by many people in different ways as they are empirically good and lend themselves to varied treatments like standards from the great American writers. However such songs as Eleanor Rigby are not so much covered. That was recorded with a doubled string quartet which , not bring classically trained, Paul would not have thought of. Another consideration might be that whereas most simple pop hip hop etc is aimed at not n musical younger folk,which are non discerning ,or may get away with trying each note in order to get something with logic to it.But as above, most composers get an idea in their heads , even if they invariably edit it later. They will probably hear the chords with the melody, even if others may make them more interesting or elaborate . Although I am completely self taught musician, I was able to correctly put down on tape what I was composing.After paying you have someone write out the music, I did the next one myself and have him play it with n keyboard for me. Having established that it was correct( though scruffy), I had no further need to pay others to do it. All my ideas start with n my head, I now firstly scribble them down on paper Top line and chords. Then I will record it either tape multirrvotded on guitar, or later using Band In A BoxI am somewhat ashamed to admit that I have never had patience to learn Cubase , and only know basics of band in a box( an age thing at 77) Hope this was helpful ",

            "answer_text": "Any honest answer must ask for more details regarding what you wish to be able to do. For example, are you referring to simple songs or symphonic orchestral music? With a knack for tunes and a nice sense of rhythm, great songs can be written without a formal knowledge of music. Remember, Paul McCartney (in his Beatles days) wrote almost all of the actual music for the songs he co-wrote with John Lennon. Lennon wrote words, McCartney wrote tunes. McCartney also could not then (and to this day still cannot) read or write music. However, he did enjoy the services of trained musicians who helped him greatly. So, I would also recommend to EVERYONE wanting to compose music of any type to learn the basics of reading and writing of tunes and simple chords. BTW, YouTube is bursting at the seams with free-of-charge web sites to assist you with learning chords. Also, learn the structures of keys (major, minor, and some of the more delicious and exotic \u201cmodes\u201d (Lydian is one of my favorites. It gives the unique flavor to Bernstein\u2019s Maria, from West Side Story.) Again, there are many, many web sites to assist with this. Just search Google (or your search engine of choice!) for such key words as learning basic scales and harmony, writing melodies, etc. Once you get started, just continue to search for the key words that represent what you need at that moment. One last word \u2014 don\u2019t hurry (especially at first). Now, with regard to serious music (Sonatas, String Quartets, stuff like that), the answer is quite different. It is critical to master each step, one at a time. In any structured environment (and these will, in the end, be your fastest route to take) you will bypass early mistakes that are so easily made by beginners. Also, please, please, please find a good instructor. He/she needn\u2019t be a professor. A second- or third-year music major from a local college would be quite fine for your early studies. You would be in fine hands with such a person. I know that that I\u2019ve been vague on details, but that is my intention. I hope, however, to have cleared the air regarding how to proceed, regarding your particular status at the moment (and only you can assess that for yourself right now). Write again if you have further questions regarding your progress. Best of luck! Music has been the most beautiful pursuit of my life. I hope it becomes such in yours. ",
