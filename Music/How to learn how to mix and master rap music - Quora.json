            "answer_text": "If you are really serious and have a budget I would recommend enrolling at a school like Expressions College or Academy of Art. Anywhere that has a reputable sound engineering program. That\u2019s the technical name for what you want to do, sound engineering. If you can\u2019t afford tuition, check Skillshare or Udemy which both have some pretty good courses on mixing and mastering. YouTube probably does as well but I would use that as a last resort. The only other option is to find someone willing to teach you. Like a friend or mentor. Mixing and mastering is hard to self teach without some kind of outside source of learning. ",
