            "answer_text": "Objective Skill (I think, not 100% sure): Vocals (I think Taeil and Doyoung are close, but Taeil overall has more power and versatility, Jaehyun also has amazing technique, Jungwoo and Haechan convey emotions well, it\u2019s harder to tell for Yuta and Johnny \u2019cause they don\u2019t sing as much but I think they overall are good but have less control, Taeyong and Mark can pass as singers but they aren\u2019t trained for it): Taeil>Doyoung>Jaehyun>Jungwoo=Haechan>Yuta=Johnny>Taeyong=Mark Rap (Mark and Taeyong are the two I most thought about, I do think Mark is slightly better, his flows and delivery are a little cleaner, harder to tell for the rest, but I think Johnny has the best objective delivery of the sub-rappers): Mark>Taeyong>>Johnny>Yuta=Jaehyun>Haechan>>Jungwoo=Taeil=Doyoung Dance (I cannot guarantee 100% this is accurate because I\u2019m not a dancer, this is based on my research. All of them are good, but Taeyong and Mark are the most precise, smooth, strong, and emotive, then Yuta and Jaehyun, the next three each have different skills, I think Haechan\u2019s really smooth, Jungwoo\u2019s precise, and Johnny\u2019s strong and has good endurance. The last two are the main vocals who aren\u2019t bad but just are last because everyone else is so good, they are just less good relatively.) Taeyong>Mark>Yuta>Jaehyun>Haechan=Jungwoo=Johnny>>Doyoung=Taeil Personal preference based on style alone: Vocals: Doyoung>Jaehyun>Taeil>Yuta>Haechan=Jungwoo=Johnny>Taeyong>Mark Rap: Taeyong>Mark>Johnny>Yuta>Haechan (even tho he rarely raps I always enjoy it when he does)>Jaehyun>Taeil=Doyoung Dance: Taeyong>Yuta>Haechan>Jungwoo=Johnny>Mark (I love mark\u2019s dancing, it\u2019s just never struck me personally)>Doyoung>Taeil DISCLAIMER: NCT is such a well-rounded group that even the lowest people are amazing.I tried to be objective and thorough for the skill one, but I am bound to make mistakes.Personal preference is solely based on what stands out to me",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think you can ever truly objectively rank them since music and art is such a subjective area, so I\u2019m gonna ranked them based on my personal preference and what styles I value when I listen/watch kpop performances. I\u2019m also adding their positions according to Kprofiles. VOCALS Taeil (main vocalist)Doyoung (main vocalist) (Doyoung and Taeil are pretty interchangeable depending on the concept and your preference)Jaehyun (main vocalist)Haechan (lead vocalist)Jungwoo (lead vocalist)Yuta: (sub vocalist) watch his White cover!!!! So good!!!Mark (sub vocalist)Taeyong (sub vocalist)Johnny (sub vocalist)RAP Mark (main rapper)Taeyong (main rapper)Johnny (sub rapper)Jaehyun (sub rapper)Yuta (sub rapper)HaechanJungwooDoyoungTaeilDANCE Taeyong (main dancer)Mark (main dancer)Haechan (lead dancer)Jaehyun (lead dancer)Jungwoo (lead dancer)Yuta (lead dancer)Johnny (lead dancer)DoyoungTaeilPersonally I would say I particularly like Jaehyun\u2019s vocal tone, Mark\u2019s rapping, and honestly Haechan\u2019s dancing. xoxo ",
