            "answer_text": "I think you don't actually have a deep sense connection with someone. You are not (for some reason) able to share what you truly want to share. Who you really are. You live with a mask not (not because you want to) but it's something that doesn't let you express yourself and reach out. You are a mere ghost of the person you could be. Maybe you are pushed away, perhaps someone is stopping you from becoming who you want to be. Don't let them. No matter who they are. They are hurting you. They are hindering your personal life. I have felt like that. I had great friends. Not such a good family situation but my friends were not enough to fulfill me as a person. I wanted to study abroad and learn writing. I am trying to achieve that now but I lack more deeper connections, more understanding. I am still working at opening myself and sharing. Believe it or not there is a lot to share! Good luck! ",
