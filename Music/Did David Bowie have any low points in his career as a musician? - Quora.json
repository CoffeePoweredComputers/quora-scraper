            "answer_text": "Yes. Several and for different reasons. Prior to the release of the Ziggy album Bowie was a one hit wonder. Space oddity had been popular and got him known but the album it came from wasn't reflective of the single and didn't sell well. His previous eponymous album had sank without trace and no one was taking his substandard quirky 60s pop songs seriously. The Man Who Sold The World and Hunky Dory got done critical recognition and with hindsight are seen as the start of his true rock genius, but at the time they weren't huge. After the commercial success of Lets Dance Bowie seemed to rest on his laurels somewhat with the rather lacklustre Tonight; a hastily put together cashing in album. For most fans this and the follow up, Never let me down, are low points, although the Glass Spider tour that accompanied NLTD was a sell out. Killing his success Bowie joined a grunge band for Tin Machine. Largely rubbished at the time it sounds, in hindsight, like proto Nirvana. Many of us hated it at the time. I've changed my mind on that one. In the 90s his music fell further from favour and allowed him to be more experimental. Feelings vary greatly on the later albums. For me Outside remains impenetrable, but I loved Earthling and Hours. Bowie considered himself an artist, not a singer. His ambition was to make rough money to let him do what he wanted. In many ways that makes his least commercial works his most interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh yes! He referred to this time as his \u201cPhil Collins years\u201d. It's not as if Bowie did anything really bad. His problem was that he was the popstar who changed everything. That's why his influence is still felt today. In my opinion, he was more important than The Beatles. The Beatles paved the way but Bowie was the first who really set off on the Yellow Brick Road and ignored the good and the bad witches and made his own way. The problem is, once you\u2019ve been a pioneer it's hard to stay ahead of the pack and remain original. Take, for example, Queen. Yes, they made music in many different styles, but the multi-tracked sound became a clich\u00e9. They tried and failed to change their sound (which Queen fan loves Hot Space?). I am a fan but regardless of this fact who has such a canon of constantly changing, always different and challenging music? Nobody. For this reason there is no true Bowie fan who prefers his \u201cPhil Collins\u201d phase. Tonight isn\u2019t a bad album compared to most of the crap that was popular in the 80s but it's certainly not what you would expect from Bowie. It's the aural equivalent of watching Mike Tyson spar with your nerdy friends from school. It should never have happened. ",

Tonight was basically an attempt to do the same again, which is never how Bowie operated in the past. Bowie spent his career as a restless mover, always going forward and always pushing himself to new things. Tonight is one of the few moments when he tried to replicate a past success and the results sounded uninspired. Critics weren\u2019t impressed and Bowie later went on to claim he wasn\u2019t impressed with the result either. ",
