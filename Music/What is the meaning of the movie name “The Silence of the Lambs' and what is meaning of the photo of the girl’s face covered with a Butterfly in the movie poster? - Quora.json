            "answer_text": "SPOILERS AHEAD:  The title, \"Silence of the Lambs,\" refers to a conversation between Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Lecter has information about serial killer Buffalo Bill, but won't give Clarice any clues about his identity until she shares some of her childhood memories. Her superiors warned her about sharing personal information with Lecter, but eventually, she shares it anyway.  She tells him about a traumatic moment from her youth: After her parent's died, she was sent to live with relatives in Montana. There was a lamb slaughterhouse nearby. She was horrified by the murder of the lambs, and even tried to save one. She felt helpless because she was unable to stop the slaughter.  The moth on the cover/poster has two meanings.  LITERAL: When performing an autopsy on one of Buffalo Bill's victims, the coroner finds an object lodged in the victim's mouth. He removes it. It's a brown pupa. He cuts it open, revealing a moth. We later discover the Buffalo Bill has a pupa breeding room at his home, where thousands of butterflies and moths flutter about. FIGURATIVE: Buffalo Bill has an obsession with moths because they represent what he wants for himself. Moths begin as caterpillars, but then enter a cocoon and emerge as fully-formed moth. He is a man who wants to become a woman, but was denied a sex-change operation. Now he murders women and collects their skin to create a \"woman suit\" -  a cocoon for himself - which he can use to become a woman.",

            "answer_text": "The movie name, \u201cThe Silence Of The Lambs\u201d, is kinda complicated, but not really. You see, Clarice and Dr. Lecter have a conversation, the scene is called \u201cQuid Pro Quo\u201d, which means \u201cSomething For Something\u201d, so Clarice shares information with Dr. Lecter, for the same in return. She tells him about how when her father died, she had no one, so she lived with her uncle, on a sheep and horse ranch.(I think). One early morning (still dark), she was awakened by a strange noise. She crept into the barn, and saw the lambs. They were screaming. She tried to free them, but they wouldn\u2019t go. So, she ran away. She took one lamb with her, thinking that if she could save one, just one, she could save them all, or, stop them all from screaming (silence). It\u2019s the same with the Buffalo Bill situation. Clarice thinks that if she can save Catherine Martin from Buffalo Bill, she can stop the entire situation.The moth on Clarice\u2019s mouth in the movie poster is an important part of the film. Dr. Lecter says, \u201cThe significance of the moth is change.\u201d, to Clarice when she tells him that during Frederika Bimmel\u2019s autopsy, they found a moth pupa directly inserted into her throat. Buffalo Bill was severely abused as a child, and he wants to change, at least, he thinks he does. He thinks he is transsexual, hence what he is doing with his victims.I hope this helps! ",
