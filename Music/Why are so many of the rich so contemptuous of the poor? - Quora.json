            "answer_text": "Three things\u2026 1 many people who are rich now made their money way back in the day or there family with somebody who did born with a silver spoon. these people go on their experience and their knowledge of how they made it happen and what their lives have been like in different times and they look at anybody who doesn't make it happen in this day and age when it's much harder as if they're just not trying they don't want it bad enough they're lazy there drug addicts etcetera it's just their fault I made it you can too you get the idea. But these are different times today come here with $10 in your pocket from another country today you'll be lucky if you don't get beat up mugged and thrown in jail long before you figure out what happened what's going on and how to get by. 2 somebody was born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they are far removed from the realities of what it's like to be poor despite trying your best. it takes not only effort on your part but opportunities being available as well. all the effort in the world means nothing if there's no opportunity that you can work at or take advantage of. dad says here's $10,000 son make it work and that son makes $10,000 into a million my only thought here is the son had $10,000 to start with (opportunity?) and he could easily risk it without having to worry about bankruptcy homelessness just being straight up left down and out if you took a bad risk. there are far fewer opportunities now than back in the day before everybody and their brother invented things and entrepreneurs made it big doing all kinds of new things leaving Less modern-day new things to be an entrepreneur in. Opportunities do still exist but they are less and harder to come by is my point. 3 perception is everything. you always hear about some homeless guy going crazy the drug addict homeless etc etc. In the news from Friends. We all know not all homeless people are drug addicts or lazy unwilling to work so why is it we never hear about them? Juicy gossip spreads the fastest people want to hear the juicy gossip and the news knows this so they're going to sell it to you if there's some crazy homeless guy staying behind your house you're going to want to talk to your friends about it your friends are going to want to tell you about it. Here's an example. Which one are you more likely to hear about A. homeless person gets high breaks into business steals and rapes Or B homeless person works does no drugs maintains normal life. you ever hear about a homeless person working who doesn't do drugs and maintains a normal upstanding life despite being homeless? Trust me they exist. Many homeless people are hidden doing their best to maintain normal appearances so much so at the guy across the room wearing a suit clean shaven ironed clothes who works might well be one of them and you never know because he looks and acts just like you. Look up online \u201cworking homeless population grows in u.s.\u201d and you'll find countless official sources stating that very fact. Also the fact that the working homeless population is growing says it is becoming more common then either homeless people are randomly starting to decide they want to work or more and more people who formerly had homes and live normal lives are being forced into homelessness despite working. The second one is certainly true there are homeless people out there on the street who do want to work to though. The last note I want to make is that when I first became homeless it was hard for me not to take attitude at people passing by. I get mad at people as they walked by look away as I look at them lie to me 100 of them in a row saying it's their last cigarette (apparently nobody ever has more than one cigarette left in a pack) even when I tried to buy one they yelled get a job assume I'm a drug addict etc. Etc. But after awhile something occurred to me maybe people don't want to recognize that good decent upstanding respectable people can land in a hard tough spot EG homeless poor through no fault of their own and get stuck there. That means reality is harsh cold and cruel and nobody wants to deal with that. It's easier just to blame the homeless person then to actually stop and say what's going on here let me let my emotions get involved let me think about this let me put some effort and thought into it give it some consideration ",

            "answer_text": "Humans are subject to experience as it happens. Individuals live in social bubbles and act accordingly. Societies formalize and enforce their own kind of powerful echo chambers and use resources, pressure, coercion and violence to keep whole populations in line. ~In interpersonal relationships, having access to financial resources creates options that are simply not available to others of lesser means. For example, we are all required by law to attend school during early childhood, and it is the wealthy who are able to devote themselves to the work of formal education. Poverty means the tax base of the local school dictates the quality of instruction available for those children who are able to attend class and are free of responsibilities at home. Foster and homeless children are not in one place long enough to adjust. The resulting socialization of individuals creates artificial, dramatically disparate ways of viewing self and others. The rich lack direct experience of being homeless or other peculiarities of growing up in poverty, but they are not spared the dehumanizing effects of their own constrained social situation. Among the few advantages of having to sit still all day is that one can judge those who are not in a position to be stuck in a stuffy classroom every day. If that's all they get for their trouble, then, yeah, the rich are going to revel in the perks of being trained in the art of competition with those who do not get a chance to read, travel abroad and dress up for dinner. ~On the level of society, culture, governance and law, having access to financial resources means that whole classes of people are actually controlling the status and circumstances of whatever groups are chosen for specific roles in scripted power-centered functions. Definitions are institutionalized and subject to exclusion and capture through the twin oppressions of abuse and neglect. The resulting institutionalization of hierarchical differences creates artificial, dramatically disparate ways of systematically treating insiders and outsiders as either privileged or \u201cother\u201d. The rich formalize their morally pure, perfectly sensible mode of behavior through normative standards of identity and conduct, enforcing rules by creating special scapegoats who can be easily punished for their own misdeeds. It means the rich can be alcoholics and beat their subordinates, but the poor go to jail for the same conduct. The rich go to rehab centers. One does not have to be rich to dismiss those who spend time behind bars. One does not have to be rich to admire those who admit they have a problem and seek help. The difference is that the poor lack access to health care and the rich are too well-represented by expensive lawyers to ever be subjected to incarceration, no matter what they do. ",
