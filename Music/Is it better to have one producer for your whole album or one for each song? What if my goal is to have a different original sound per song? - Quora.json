            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer the two parts of your question separately, as they are quite opposite. One of the many roles of a producer, is to provide a coherence to an artist\u2019s music portfolio. This can be done via many different ways, working on arrangementaudio engineering during the recording stage (using certain microphone techniques, certain effects, certain rooms, \u2026)audio engineering during the mixing stage (using certain mixing techniques, compression tricks, certain effects, applying a certain \u201ctouch\u201d for which a specific producer is known, \u2026)mastering stage (where the mastering engineer can further contribute to bringing coherence, via EQ, compression, etc.)So usually, artists choose a producer with whom they have a particular vibe going. Then you ask a very legitimate question: what if you want a different sound for each song? Although some of the answers have underlined that this might be quite unusual, why not? After all, this is already quite common in the R&B world, where each song might not only feature a different team of producers, but even a different vocalist. Yet the album still would have a common guideline: YOU It would inherently be more expensive, as contracting one producer for 14 songs (average number of songs per album) allows you to negotiate a package deal, but it wouldn\u2019t be more than triple the budget, I reckon. Would one producer be able to pull off 14 different styles and sounds? Let\u2019s be honest here: not likely. Or at least, it\u2019d probably end up costing as much as if you\u2019d gone for different producers. The reason being, if you tasked me with producing 14 different styles of sound, I\u2019d want to use 14 different techniques altogether, starting with at least, 5 or 6 different environments (rooms / acoustics), meaning either an expensive recording facility that has that many different rooms, or travelling to various places. Same with consoles, microphones, etc., to try and get more variation in sound colouration. All in all, a very intense exercise, and you\u2019d need to let that one producer breathe a bit to get fresh ideas (to get out of their comfort zone), whereas hiring different producers will inherently give you that different approach to begin with. That\u2019s my humble opinion. Hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "The base sound should be the responsibility of the composer/arranger and/or performer(s), the producer normally just puts all the stuff together, in a way that badly destroys the base material, or makes it work together like an organic thing, adding some spice and sometimes magic. Finding one of the latter witch fits you well is already hard, and letting different producers do different songs on an album will quickly sound messy, often terrible. There are also a few audio wizards who can turn any fart in 30 different moving songs, but, those only will be tempted to work with HUGE talent, or HUGE sums of money, cause they might just as well do it alone. Personally I always produce myself, better (for me). ",
