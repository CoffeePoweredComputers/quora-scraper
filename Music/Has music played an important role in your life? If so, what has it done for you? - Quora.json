            "answer_text": "Music has been a huge part of my life for almost 10 years now. As a kid, I was pretty indifferent to music as an art form. Sure, there were songs I liked, but none that I really sought out. But around age 13, that began to change. I started finding more and more songs I really liked, and started listening to them any chance I got. Then, in 2009, when I was 14 years old, it happened. I got an iPod for Christmas.  Sure, it was one of those tiny little iPod Shuffles. The ones that barely held 200 songs. (Does anyone remember these things, by the way?) But, man, that Christmas morning I couldn\u2019t care less. I could finally listen to the music I loved wherever and whenever I wanted! And from there, my love of music just continued to blossom. In the years since I got that first iPod, music has been almost like a best friend to me. It\u2019s there to comfort me when I\u2019m sad. Calm me down when I\u2019m angry. Pump me up when I\u2019m out for a run. Pat me on the back and tell me \u201cI know what you\u2019re going through, even when it feels like no one else does.\u201d There\u2019s also just this\u2026this rush that I get from listening to a really good song. It\u2019s the kind of thing that\u2019s hard to put into words. Hearing a really good song for the first time is almost like getting your first kiss, or eating your favourite food\u2026there\u2019s just this adrenaline rush that comes with it, and it\u2019s amazing. Ever since 2009 or so I\u2019ve fallen deeper and deeper in love with music as an art form. I\u2019m almost constantly listening to music. I can talk about music all day. There are hundreds of albums, thousands of songs, that I absolutely love, and that have legitimately improved my life just by existing. For the past decade, music has been a huge part of my life. And I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. ",
