In concert, after a performance of \u201c1977\u201d, with it\u2019s rousing chorus \u201cNo Elvis Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977\u201d he told the audience that John Lennon was all right, though. He also seems to have been open to his friends about John Lennon being a sort of template for him. He may not have liked McCartney\u2019s too much though. Mick Jones probably had less of a problem with the other Beatles (especially McCartney; as a musical craftsman I can\u2019t imagine he wouldn\u2019t have appreciated what Paul brought to the Beatles.)

In London Calling, they reference The Beatles in the line, \u201cPhony Beatlemania has bitten the dust.\u201d This is mostly due to the historic rivalry between punks and hippies. However, as many other answers have stated the band may have privately appreciated their work. ",
