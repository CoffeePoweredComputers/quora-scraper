I like more of his music ( my favorite is Hitch Hike )and especially those memorable duets he made with several of Motowns female artists ( especially Tammi Terrell ) like Ain\u2019t Nothing Like The Real Thing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" Lyric , Ain\u2019t No Mountain High Enough and If I Could Build My Whole World Around You . Then there\u2019s the nice duet It Takes Two performed with the lovely Kim Weston from 67\u2019 A Motown Classic \"Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston- It Takes Two\". Musical greatness personified !   ",
