            "answer_text": "Most famously speaking I think Bobby Brown\u2019s song from the Ghostbusters II soundtrack has this featured, but \u201coh we oh\u201d has been used in films and songs for decades. I don\u2019t know who first used it. It sounds like a chant you could use to keep everybody focused during a long trek or march. I think the biggest visibilty use was as the chant of the Wicked Witch of the West\u2019s guards in The Wizard of Oz. But after that it\u2019s been used very often! ",
