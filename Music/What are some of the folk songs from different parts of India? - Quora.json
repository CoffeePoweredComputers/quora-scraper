            "answer_text": "I can give some idea about the north indian folk music especially that belonging to uttar pradesh..Folk music stands for \"Lok\"geet in hindi. \"Lok\" means people and hence folk musc is the most democratic and participative form of music. Every folk song is a story in itself. It is orally transmitted over generations. They are simple, emotive and catchy in terms of their melody.Fundamentally it has 5 types1- \"Sanskar\" geet- which relate to birth of a child, various ceremonies of chld( Annnaprashan,Janeyu), Wedding(haldi, banna-banni geet, dwarchar,jayamaal)  and even death as in the case of \"nirgun\" 2- Songs on season-  SPRING time-Holi, Ulara, Jhoola, Fag( Feb,Mar,april) RAINS-   Saavan, Kajri(August,Sept)3- Work songs- These are sung in groups while working on the fields like \"Ropni\" , \"katni\", \"kumhar geet\"(sowing, harvesting, pottery)4- Devi geet or songs in the name of traditional gods or goddesses. eg Pachra geet or Chatth songs. this includes \"Mela\" geet meaning songs sung in traditional festivals or fairs.5- Social issues- Migrant community songs like  \" Bidesia\", patriotic songs written in the name of Gandhiji, \"Nautanki\"(satirical verses) Local dialects like Avadhi, Bhojpuri are used to sing these songs.

            "answer_text": "Folk Music  is diverse because of India's vast cultural diversity. Though it might  be started with devotional songs later it covered each & every part  of contemporary human life including psychology, philosophy, anatomy, socio-economic condition, love, day to day living etc. and in many of them you will find deep insight into life.  I am Gujarati and fond of listening folk songs.Some of Gujarati folk songs are also famous as Garba. List of famous Gujarati folk songs are: - Man mor bni thangat kre (also included in movie \"Ram-leela\")- Tare angniye koi aavi chade to aavkaro meetho aapje (Dula Bhaya Kag)- Kasumbi no rang (written by Zaverchand Meghani)- Mare todle betho re more kya bole..- Pankhida ne aa pinjaru junu junu lage...- Vijli na chamkare motida parovo panbai- Bhakti to karvi to avi krvi..- Umbre ubhi sambhlu re bol valam na..- Kon julave limdi...- Vadlo kahe vanrayu salgi..- Mehndi te vavi malve ne ano rang gyo gujarat..- Mele mele morladi hele chadi..(it becomes a famous garbo) ",
