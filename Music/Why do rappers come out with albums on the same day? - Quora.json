            "answer_text": "Well generally albums come out on Fridays, so of course there will be multiple releases of albums on Fridays. Another reason with hip hop in general is competition. Since the days of tupac and biggie, rap has been like a sport that everyone wants to win or \u201cbe the king\u201d of. These reasons vary from rival gangs (bloods and crips) to younger rappers trying to prove themselves to the elder rappers This is what j Cole did when he dropped Born Sinner the same day Kanye dropped Yeezus Here's some lyrics from \u201cforbidden fruit \u201c \u201cI\u2019mm drop the album same day as Kanye Just to show the boyz the man now like Wany\u00e1 And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect\u201d Another reason is that rappers think if they sell more then they're style is superior to others. A famous case of this was when Kanye West and 50 Cent decided to release albums on the same day, the latter claiming he would end the other\u2019s career.  It turned out that Kanye outsold 50 cent with Graduation; a more poppy, positive message album then 50\u2019s Curtis; a more gangster attitude album with more violent lyrics This was a huge deal to hip hop back then because back then there weren't people like Kanye, who were experimenting with the samples he was, who was wearing pink polos and backpacks and not flaunting a gangster, drug filled life in his songs Kanye inspired a whole new generation with albums like graduation and 808s and heartbreak, such as Drake, Kid Cudi, and future. I know my Answer got a little long but I hope I helped! ",

            "answer_text": "When an artist or label or distributor puts out an album/single/ep then they choose a specific and scheduled date usually a week or two out or even longer which gives a higher chance of an artist dropping on the same date as another artist. A release could be sent out in January and it be scheduled to release in March but someone in February could, coincidentally, pick the same date or the day after for it to drop, unknowingly having the album drop on the same day as another rapper.
