Though all of them have their raps, the Isle Of Flightless Birds rap is really fast\u2014 not to mention Zack\u2019s rap in Kitchen Sink. \u2026 If you\u2019re talking about the fastest part in a song, I\u2019d say Zack\u2019s rap in Kitchen Sink. If you\u2019re talking about a whole song, I think Levitate would be the answer. ",

Overall Ode to Sleep is a syllable faster, but only if you count both verses Tyler raps.
