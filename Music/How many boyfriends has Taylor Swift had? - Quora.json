            "answer_text": "If we are here discussing Taylor's dating history then I'd go way back to 2009 when Taylor dated Lucas Till who was her co-star in her hit music video \u201cYou Belong With Me\". But they dated for only a month from March 2019 to April 2019 because Lucas said that he saw her only as a friend. Then Taylor dated the actor Taylor Lautner (they met while acting together in the movie \u201cValentine's Day\". They dated from August 2009 til December 2009 and then Taylor Swift released her song \u201cBack to December\u201d in which she spoke of a guy who she dumped and described him as having \u201ctanned skin\" and a \u201csweet smile\" and we all know that's Lautner. Then comes John Mayer when they met in the summer of 2010 and then she told him through her lyrics \u201cDon't you think i was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.\u201d. And even i, a swiftie think that this was way too dramatic. They dated from December 2009 til February 2010. Next is Cory Monteith, she told on Yahoo that her song \u201cMine\" was about a guy \u201cThat i just barely knew put his arm around me by the water and i saw the entire relationship flash before my eyes.\u201d The late \u201cGlee\u201d star Cory never confirmed their relationship but they both turned bright red when Ellen DeGeneres talked about them. They dated for only a month from April 2010 to May 2010. After that Taylor dated Jake Gyenhall from October 2010 til January 2011. People really supported them both because they were a great pair. In the US Weekly the main title was \u201cJAKE AND TAYLOR IN LOVE! From secret dates to private weekends with the parents - after just five weeks! Inside their sudden romance\u201d. In her song \u201cThe Last Time\" Taylor talked about an unreliable kind of guy because you never know when he's going to leave, you never know when he's going to come back, but he always does come back. \u201cPut my name at the top of your list.\u201d From \u201cThe Last Time\" was about him. Later from October 2011 to January 2012, Taylor dated the \u201cMy week with Marilyn\u201d star Eddie Redmayne. But even now the 31 year old star is still denying their relationship. Their three month fling ended soon though. After that Taylor dated Zac Efron from for a month from February 2012 to March 2012 while promoting their movie \u201cThe Lorax.\u201d. Both deny the rumours though and Efron doesn't seem to be attached to any of the songs from \u201cRed\". The relationship didn't quite make the news like the one with Jake Gyenhall. During an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Taylor said that her song \u201cBegin Again\" was about \u201cwhen you've finally gotten through a bad relationship and you dust yourself off.\u201d Taylor was dating 18 year old Connor Kennedy, from July 2012 to October 2012 and she sung about him in her single \u201cBegin Again\" when she said \u201cI think it's strange that you think I'm funny \u2019cause he never did.\u201d So this one is my favourite and i still ship them. It's Harry Styles from One Direction. From the moment They stepped out together Harry was scrutinised by the media before they were officially a couple. But a few months after they had a rumoured fling in April 2012 she wrote the song \u201cI knew you were trouble\u201d and once they broke up she tweeted one lyric from her song \u201c\u2026til you put me down,\u201d for the fans to know it was over. Two years later in her song \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d which is rumoured to be about Harry Styles, the song has references to their December Romance and the \u201csnowmobile accident.\" The couple dated from December 2012 to January 2013. Next comes Calvin Harris. The duo met through a mutual friend Ellie Goulding at the Brit Awards in 2015, and they immediately hit it off. The couple was a match made in Music Heaven. Spending July 4th Holidays together on the beach and celebrating their one year with a homemade cake. But all good things come to an end. In her music video of \u201cLook what you make me do.\u201d Taylor crawls out of a graveyard next to a headstone that says \u201cNils Sjoberg\u201d which was psydenom she used in Rihanna and Calvin Harris's hit \u201cThis is what you came for.\u201d They dated an year from February 2015 to June 2016. And finally Tom Hiddleston from June 2016 to September 2016. Few days before her public break up with dance EDM artist Calvin Harris. Swift was seen dancing with Tom Hiddleston at the Met Gala. Then a few days later they were spotted sitting at the beach kissing and cuddling. After three months \u201cmeeting the parents and spending the 4th of July with the Swift Squad\" the couple broke up and in her music video of \u201cLook what you made me do\u201d the male dancers behind Taylor were wearing shirts with \u201c I <3 TS\" (I love Taylor Swift) which was a reference to the white tank Hiddleston wore on the 4th of July and he was trolled for it.

She may dedicate some songs to some boys but the above names are the only guys he dated and fell in love with. And hopefully, and thankfully, Joe Alwyn is the right guy for her. I couldn\u2019t be happier for her for finally being happy after failed relationships. Love you, Taytay. ",
