            "answer_text": "Many years ago I worked as a television serviceman. In those days, there was only BBC and ITV in Britain and programmes were limited, mostly in the evenings. During the morning, BBC transmitted a test card - test card C - and myself and the other servicemen on the staff knew the music sequence by heart. All of it was instrumental in form (other than one track which was actually created with the barking of dogs, amazing as that sounds. It was actually rather clever!) Anyway, we all enjoyed the music. Ring of Kerry, Tchaikovsky\u2019s Polonaise from Eugene Onegin, Polovtsian Dances by Borodin and many others. We may have been a little odd - most TV service engineers were! - but as for mental problems, no worse than average, I\u2019d guess. A great deal of classical and light music is played without lyrics, often written without lyrics and complete in its own right. Therefore those who say you have mental problems because you prefer such music are wrong, in fact ludicrously so. Carry on! ",

            "answer_text": "Only a certified mental health provider can and should diagnose anyone. Having said that. just because you like one type of music and friends or acquaintances disagree tells me is time to change friends. Intolerant people can become bullies very quickly. I like classical and Latin music from the 1920s to the 1960s. Does that make me crazy? No, I am just very particular about what I listen to and very careful about how I spend my time and very importantly about not losing my hearing, which so far is pretty good. Hint: Prioritize. Enjoy!
