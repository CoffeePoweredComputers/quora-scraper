            "answer_text": "Have you ever been in a conversation with someone, and you just stand there waiting for them to finish talking so you can say what you want to say? That's hearing someone. The sound of their words wash around you, but you don't really process the points they're making. Instead, you're forming a response to the tiny part of their side that you listened to them say at the beginning, almost completely ignoring whatever they are still trying to tell you. Listening is waiting to form a response until someone finishes speaking. You give all your attention to what they're saying, without interrupting. After they speak, you take a second to process all the points and ideas that they have shared. Then you share a response, based on everything they said- not just the snippet you listened to before you started thinking about what you wanted to say next. Basically, hearing is in one ear and out the other, with no rest stop in between. ",
