            "answer_text": "NWA - Not only a significant presence on the West Coast, but in terms of individual star power, this is about as good as groups get. Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy E, MC Ren and Yella all started here. If you look at everyone whose careers got started because of Cube (Westside Connection, Kam, Yo-Yo), Dr. Dre (Snoop Dogg, Dogg Pound, Eminem, and everyone else who was affiliated with Death Row, Aftermath and Shady) and Eazy E (Bone Thugs N Harmony, The DOC, Michel'le and everyone else on Ruthless Records), this was easily the most important collective of young talent in any genre of music.  Public Enemy - The first guys to make serious, socially conscious rap music. Chuck D was always intelligent and insightful, and never strayed away from getting political. Though Flavor Flav was not much of a rapper, he is one of the all-time great hype men. And lastly, there were their beats, the awesome productions by The Bomb Squad with additions from Terminator X. Chuck D remains an important activist for hip hop.  Cypress Hill - The first guys to make drugs the basis for their content (very controversial). Also pioneers in the Latino hip hop movement. Some of the best at bilingual and codeswitching raps. DJ Muggs is one of the best at flipping samples.  2 Live Crew - The pioneers of the Southern rap and the Miami bass sound. Extremely important group for pushing the envelope for freedom of speech. As Nasty As They Wanna Be was the first album in history to be lableled \"legally obscene\" after a US District Court in Florida ruled against it (ruling was later overturned).  Their music was highly sexual in nature, but unique. Also played an important role in helping University of Miami's football team become a dominant force in college football. Seriously, they did. Check out ESPN's 30 for 30 documentary The U.  A Tribe Called Quest/ De La Soul - As members of the Native Tongue, both groups were influential in starting and furthering the alternative hip hop movement. They went in different directions, but both groups put out groundbreaking albums throughout the 90s. Stetsasonic - The first rap group to work as a live band, a style that would influence, The Roots (my favorite band), Digital Underground (the highly influential collective that introduced 2pac to the rap world), The Beastie Boys (circa Check Your Head) and many others.  The Beastie Boys - Decades of hit songs that have gone in many creative directions. Be it rap/rock on License to Ill, heavy sample-based sound on Paul's Boutique, live funk instrumentation on Check Your Head, the straightforward hip hop sound on To The 5 Boroughs, or a mix of all the above like Ill Communication, these guys have never put out a bad album. One of the most synergistic bands of all time, they have a unique form of rhyming in which they share verses and and complete each others' bars, making it that no one rapper stands out more than the other. This style of shared rapping is a big part of the reason why they've lasted so long. They all contribute equally.  Lil Jon - Hate him or love him, he is the King of Crunk, and the Crunk sound was one of the most influential production styles of the 2000s. Obnoxious, but kinda lovable as a rapper.  Master P - The man who introduced the world to one half of the New Orleans sound. Created the massive No Limit empire of hip hop, fashion, film, sports and every other thing he wanted.  The Hot Boys - Juvenile, Turk, BG and a pint- sized teenager named Lil Wayne. These are the guys who gave the world the other (and better) half of the New Orleans style. Powered by Mannie Fresh's beats, they were unstoppable during the late 90s and 2000s. Mannie and Wayne's empire continues to spread as Cash Money and Young Money. Geto Boys - The heroes of Houston since their 1988 album Making Trouble. Often credited as the godfathers of Dirty South. Much like NWA, this was a group with serious individual star power (Scarface, Bushwick Bill, Willie D, Big Mike and others). All Texas rappers were influenced by these guys.  Too Short - The true pioneer of Bay Area rap. He had a heavy influence on Souls of Mischief, Casual, Digital Underground, E-40, Ant Banks, Extra Prolific, and pretty much every other rapper to come out of Oakland, Vallejo and the rest of the Bay.   Wu Tang Clan - Ghostface Killa. RZA. GZA. Method Man. Old Dirty Bastard Raekwon. The talent pool in the Wu was endless. Their group and individual albums combine for one of the most impressive discographies ever . RZA's productions sound like nothing else out there. New York rap was always all about Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem and The Bronx, but these were the first to really rep Staten Island. ",

            "answer_text": "I second Aaron Ellis on N.W.A., Public Enemy, Native Tongues (Tribe, De la Soul - and don't forget about The Jungle Brothers!), Too $hort, Beastie Boys and Wu-Tang Clan. I would also add... Eric B. and Rakim - Relative to his peers, Rakim took lyrical wordplay to a different dimension.  Don't know this for a fact but I believe he was one of the first to use internal rhymes.  Influenced countless number of emcees.   The Dungeon Family (Outkast, Goodie Mob, etc.) - I grew up in FL and 2 Live Crew, Poison Clan, The Dogs were big down there and helped put Miami rap on the map.   What they did for Miami, Outkast and the Dungeon Family did for the ATL.  And then some.  They had their own family of producers and collaborators.  They paved the way for countless number of southern groups. Boogie Down Productions - I think BDP has a unique distinction of influencing both gangster and conscious rappers.  From Criminal Minded to You Must Learn. Ice-T - I think Ice-T opened the door for NWA and then they knocked the damn thing down.  But Ice-T had 2-3 albums and several videos that laid the groundwork for that genre.   Honorable Mentions -  MC LyteKool G. RapEPMD ",
