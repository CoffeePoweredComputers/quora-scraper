I had no idea how to create a video. Then I created my first one, and I changed my mind as soon as I published it. It was so silly; I can\u2019t even explain. After a slight panic, I figured out the way to delete it: Go to your profile firstOpen the video that you want goneYou\u2019ll see an icon with three dots (...) at the bottom right cornerTap that icon, and you\u2019ll see a trash canTap the can to delete the videoConfirm your actionYou\u2019re done. Actually, TikTok is an easy app to use once you get to know its features. Now that I shared my embarrassing beginnings with TikTok, I have to say that I grew to love the app. It\u2019s not that hard to get used to it. With all the social distancing right now, what do we have? To be honest, TikTok made my days more interesting. I still film silly videos, but I no longer delete them. Let them be. They remind me of happy moments. ",
