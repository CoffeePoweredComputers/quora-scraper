            "answer_text": "These aren\u2019t in order. And I\u2019m not hating at all. Angelica had no brothers- Although she was the oldest sibling that was ALIVE, she did have several brothers. John Adams fired Hamilton- Hamilton actually resigned when Washington was still President, even though Hamilton still co-wrote the Farewell Address, he wasn\u2019t in the cabinet at the time Hamilton punched the bursar- He did have a disagreement with someone working at Princeton College but it wasn\u2019t the bursar and I doubt there was physical harm done. Thomas Jefferson was loud and arrogant as Hamilton- Thomas Jefferson was quite reserved. Jefferson, Burr, and Madison were the ones who found out about the Reynolds Affair- A different James (James Monroe instead of James Madison), Abraham Venable, and Frederick Muhlenberg were the first to find out. And I may be mistaken but Hamilton *thought* that Madison knew about the affair but he didn\u2019t. Madison and Hamilton were against each other- They were friends, or at least civil enough with each other to be called friendly. They did write the Federalist Papers together, after all. Angelica was single when Hamilton met her- She was married, and it\u2019s debated whether or not she was *happily* married, which was probably the case, due to the marriage being an elopement. John Jay wrote 5 then stopped because sickness- John Jay wrote 4 before falling sick but finished the 5th after he got well again. Phillip Hamilton died because of 7- The duel between Phillip and George Eacker. In real life, they counted to 10 and actually were confused on what to do for a few minutes before Phillip decided to raise his gun to the sky and Eacker thought it was to shot him and quickly shot him in defense. They wrote the Federalist Papers after being lawyers- In the beginning part of Non-stop, they sang about the \u201cfirst murder trial\u201d and it was with \u201cLevi Weeks\u201d which happened in 1800. The middle-ish part talked about the Federalist Papers which were published way before that. Phillip died before the Election of 1800- Another inaccuracy about timing. He died in 1801. You can do the math on that one. There were 10 Duel Commandments- There are actually 25. Phillip- They had 8 children, only one of which is an actual character and only one other sibling is referenced (Angelica Hamilton was only referenced 2 or 3 times). And he asked for a little brother even though he had multiple at the point. Eliza ensured Hamilton\u2019s legacy- We all mostly forgot about him until Lin made the musical. Eliza- She was more commonly referenced to using her full name or Betsy in the time of her life. Casting- I like that they used POC for the cast but that isn\u2019t accurate at all to the diversity that the past lacked. Hamilton was a super abolitionist- He was against slavery, sure, but he didn\u2019t express it too much in his writings. He inherited slaves and viewed them more as siblings. Laurens timing- Something is off about the timing of Yorktown and Laurens\u2019 involvement in it. He was in Yorktown and still went down to South Carolina after that and the war was not technically over yet, opposed to what was stated in Laurens\u2019 Interlude. Endorsement of Jefferson killed Hamilton- Sure, the endorsement pushed Burr against him more, but the election about NY Governor in 1804 was the very last straw. Hamilton had no career after the Reynolds Pamphlet- He served as a Military General only a couple years later. Common people voted and could sway the outcome- Only rich people with a special rank could vote. Campaigning- Public campaigning wasn\u2019t a thing. Burr was Lee\u2019s second in the Lee/Laurens duel- It was Evan Edwards. Hamilton met the love of his life the same time as his 3 other friends (I\u2019m kidding)- He didn\u2019t meet Laurens (okay only sort of kidding, but have you read Hammy\u2019s letters to him?), Burr, Lafayette, and Mulligan at the same time. They might have been different days and different years for each of them. Peggy- She lived for a while then died the same year as Phillip and nothing is mentioned of her after \u201cthe night\u201d Eliza and Angelica met Alexander, although he was a pen pal with her for the longest and educated Eliza on Peggy\u2019s health conditions all the way to her death. Sally- This isn\u2019t so much an inaccuracy as much as under-explaining. Alexander wasn\u2019t the only one to be rumored of the founding fathers to have an affair, and Jefferson\u2019s was with his own slave. Feral Tomcat- Martha Washington didn\u2019t name a cat after Alexander Hamilton as far as we know. Phillip\u2019s wound had an infection- Infections take hours (12+ or 24+ I don\u2019t remember) to occur in a wound. And germ theories didn\u2019t develop until decades later. Jefferson won in a landslide- He won by only one or two votes. Burr was a decent guy- He was a jerk irl. Sam Adams beer- Laurens notes drinking it for work and whatever but it wasn\u2019t invented until the 20th century. But drinking was more common back in those days, since water was making people sick. These are only the ones I have the energy to remember for now ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! So of course Hamilton has a ton of inaccuracies. Lin did pretty well, but there were some things that needed to be done to move the plot along. Here are the ones I can think of right now: The Schuyler Siblings? Yup, they had brothers. I could be wrong, but I think I heard there were around 15 Schuylers in total. Woah.The real reason Aaron Burr fast-tracked through college. This isn\u2019t really an inaccuracy, more like it was skimmed over. Aaron Burr\u2019s father, Aaron Burr Sr., was the president or head or whatever of the college. So yeah, that helped (I can\u2019t remember if his parents were dead or not though like the musical says\u2026) (Also fun fact: the reason Hamilton wasn\u2019t allowed to fast-track was because James Madison had tried to do it before and had a nervous breakdown)Hamilton was a loyalist. What??? Nope, I kid you not. When Hamilton first arrived in America, he was extremely sympathetic to the king\u2019s cause, as the newspapers in Nevis were loyalist. He was nothing like the passionate man we see in My Shot. Once he met Hercules Mulligan, he was persuaded to the revolutionary side. Speaking of\u2026They didn\u2019t meet him at the same side. I believe Hercules met him first, and I\u2019m not sure about Lafayette and Laurens. I\u2019m also pretty sure they weren\u2019t the tight-knit group shown in the musical. Hamilton was close friends with all of them, but I\u2019m not sure they were close friends with each other.Angelica was married. Angelica was already married in 1780 when she met Hamilton, not in 1787 as the musical would have you believe. However, there was a lot of speculation about the relationship/attraction between Hamilton and Angelica.On the topic of abolitionism. Unfortunately, Hamilton was not the fierce abolitionist shown. He did have slaves, for the purpose of fitting societal standards. Although he would say he didn\u2019t believe in slavery, he didn\u2019t do much about it.Where is the relationship between Hamilton and Laurens? Nuff said. But in all seriousness, I suspect there wasn\u2019t enough room for more romance and speculations in the show.Philip died in 1801. Notice that Blow Us All Away takes place before The Election of 1800. Lin was probably trying to separate the personal life from political life. (\u201cCan we get back to politics?\u201d)Where the fuck is Peggy? I know they needed Jazzy for Maria, but I kind of wish they addressed this, especially when the pull out the Schuyler sisters motif in Take a Break. I\u2019d always assumed she died, which she did, but she died in 1801 just like Philip?James Monroe knew. You know the song We Know when Jefferson, Burr, and Madison confront Hamilton about his possible embezzlement? It was actually James Monroe. Then later, when an article suggested something about the affair, Hamilton blew up and wrote the Reynolds Pamphlet.\u201cI\u2019m erasing myself from the narrative.\u201d This isn\u2019t really a historical inaccuracy, just a creative liberty. Basically, all the letters written from Eliza to Hamilton (maybe vice versa- I can\u2019t remember) are missing. His to hers are all intact. No one knows what happened, so Lin made it up and I think it\u2019s pretty cool. However, it\u2019s unlikely, as all of them, even ones she wrote after Burn would have taken place, are missing. More likely someone did something to them after her death (or Hanilton\u2019s I suppose, so it could have been her).Burr was running with Jefferson. Yup, Burr was not running against Jefferson. He was running for Vice President. I\u2019m not quite clear on what happened, but one way or another people decided they liked Burr more and voted for him over Jefferson. Then Hamilton endorsed him and you know the rest.Or do you? Burr did not kill Hamilton over the Election of 1800. If you look at the dates, Burr did not kill Hamilton until a few years later. Basically, the same thing happened again when Burr ran for governor: Hamilton endorsed his opponent, or said something bad about him. 1800 was the turning point, but the second time around really tipped Burr over the edge.This is all I can think of right now. I hope you found it interesting to read! ",
