            "answer_text": "I think you mean the Billie Eilish song. On its face it\u2019s about a girl who acknowledges that she\u2019s nothing but trouble, especially for this one guy who already has a girlfriend, and doesn\u2019t care how much mayhem that happens to her and that she causes. But when you get to the end of the song, it sounds more like the narrator of the song is a sort of fictional idealized media-created version of a \u201cbad girl\u201d that this guy has in his head. He wishes she was a real girl. He wants her to be real so he can abuse her and get away with it. And she\u2019d never leave him like his actual girlfriend did. He\u2019s likely projected this fictional image onto his girlfriend that he wants her to be: a submissive slut monster devoted exclusively to him no matter what he does to her. And it\u2019s the fictional image is who is singing this back to him. I\u2019m going to sound old for saying this, but there\u2019s a climactic scene in the last season of the TV show Thirty-Something, where the image of a woman in an ad exec\u2019s advertising campaign starts to talk to the main character about who she\u2019s supposed to be. That\u2019s what this song reminds me of. Not the character herself, but the fact that she\u2019s fictional and speaking to him.  ",
