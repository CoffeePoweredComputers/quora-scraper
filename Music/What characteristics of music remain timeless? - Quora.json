            "answer_text": "\u201cTimelessness\u201d to me would evoke concern with a theme, or a subject, that applies in any period of history one cares to name. If texted music, the text will concern those core issues that touch us all\u2014love, strife, joy, death. If it concerns current political issues at all, it will treat them in such a way as to emphasize the parts that are common to all periods (say, the mendacity of political figures) rather than any current events. With non-texted (instrumental) music, I would think of any pieces that are well-organized and don\u2019t really need any explanation to be grasped\u2014or, if they are somewhat more complex, have enough surface sheen to get listeners to stick with the piece until one day it all makes sense to them. To me, the style of the music is irrelevant to its timelessness. In a recent answer\u2014(Steve Kahn's answer to How do you create a good musical piece?)\u2014I touched on some of the things I thought would make a good instrumental piece. I believe these same considerations apply to \u201ctimelessness\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Such a hard question to answer.. and a good question.. obviously if people still listen to it years later. I think all really good music is, though. If something really sounds good then it never stops sounding good. One way you can tell is just by listening to a lot of music and developing your ear and your taste. I\u2019m sure some people are more apt at that and that they\u2019re usually the ones who are crazy about music already. But still, just listen to a lot of music, be both open and confident in your taste and critical. Generally the good music is the music that gets stuck in your head in a way that makes you feel like you have to listen to it again. A good song you can listen to 100 times in a row. You get over it but you always think it\u2019s great. Any time you hear it in public you get pumped. And you keep coming back to it and it keeps growing on you, as oppose to music that starts to get boring quickly. You\u2019ll look back at that later and think \u2018man, what was I thinking?\u2019 Whereas the stuff that grows on you will always seem great. You love revisiting it. And if you do that often enough and with enough different things, then you start to have a quicker ear for the ones that are going to last for you. You can tell the first time you hear something. And you start to pick up on it a lot, cuz there\u2019s a lot more going around than we realize. Then you get proven right years later when your favorite music comes back and starts to be called timeless, while the music you weren\u2019t into doesn\u2019t. So it is possible which means it\u2019s not just incidental, there are reasons that some music is timeless and it could potentially be analyzed. Even if we can\u2019t figure out exactly how. ",
