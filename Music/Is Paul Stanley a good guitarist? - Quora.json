            "answer_text": "I've answered something similar about Slash, in that - Yes of course he is because;He has written, recorded, played live 1000's of times to millions of paying public bringing unquestionable joy to over 4 decades of people. His guitar playing and writing is forever imprinted on over 60 million albums. His timing is spot on, his stage presence and technique given the energy he spends on stage is remarkable and his tone is thick.Are there players sitting in a bedroom some where that can play Hendrix better than him? Are the same players competent at playing 16th notes at 240 bpm? Absolutely!  Does Paul say he is a brilliant guitarist...NO WAY in fact he hates discussing gear and effects and amp speakers he can't give a rats about any of it. But he has used the guitar as one tool to make sure he never ever has to work 9 to 5 or ever have an issue with the landlord. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. No because as others have said their are other players, both famous and not famous who have way better skill, variety etc. Yes and a resounding yes because he has used the guitar as an instrument to bring the joy of hard rock and heavy metal to millions of people. Along with James Hetfield and Izzy stradlin he is my favourite solely rhythm player. One of my most prized possessions is a Paul stanley iceman, circa 1977 \u2014 1980 and circa 1992 \u2014 1996. ",
