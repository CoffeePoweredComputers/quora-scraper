            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019ll try to give an unbiased opinion, which I\u2019m pretty sure will be biased. And to answer, WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE BTS SONGS? with another question, WHY WON\u2019T PEOPLE LIKE BTS SONGS? or a statement, I DON\u2019T SEE WHY NOT? Firstly, let\u2019s look at them as artists. BTS has amazing vocals and rappers. They have potential which keeps on expanding over the years, comparing their previous songs and now, their vocals have gone way high, and their rappers have gone from good to better and even more better. A shout out to JIN and J HOPE in particular. Aside from vocals and rap, as dancers, their dance is top notch. All K pop groups are really focused in dance, as they have to be pretty and sing and dance, and BTS is no exception. And the thing about them is it gets better and, they have set the bar really high for newer groups. Before it was their synchronization that was the best in their choreo, and it still is, but now it\u2019s not only the amazing sync, but also the dance in itself. The dance line was always good, and are even better now, but a particular shout out to TAE HYUNG and JIN. And moving on to technical levels- song writing- They have been writing songs from the beginning of their debut and even before and have been participating in the song writing and are still in it, and I guess that is why they are able to convey the emotions so well, on a deeper level. Like when they are actually expressing the raw emotions from their own heart. It is not something that can be taught, but it is something that comes from within them cause they were the ones who wrote it. I have loved their choice of words like a real lot. Shout out to all their ballads lol, I mean they\u2019re all good to be specific, however, in the more recent ones, I absolute love FAKE LOVE.production- Just as song writing, they have been a part of the production team from the beginning, and I SWEAR on MY Left hand that you will find no other like BTS\u2019s music tracks. Every single one of their songs have a touch of so many hands and heads put together and it makes it works out every time. I want to give a particular shout out to a lesser known song of theirs COFFEE. The track here is different on a different way, I won\u2019t say it is extravagant, but it definitely shows something \u2026 different and I really like it. You won\u2019t find and BTS song with just an acoustic track, unless it is particularly the acoustic version. It is skilful and shows their talents. and they got so much more better over the years. Shout out to SEA, BUTTERFLY and FAKE LOVE. Another shout out to MAGIC SHOP and our golden maknae KOOK for the production.MV- One thing about their MV, don\u2019t watch it unless you already know the members. Watching any kpop MV without recognising the members is a real daunting task. I for one, don't enjoy it at all. So, as I was saying, upon comparison, their MVs have gained so much more better quality and the like, you know. From just blank props to complicated castles, and having sets which values over millions of dollars now, they really have done it all. I likes all their sets and MVs though. Special shout out to FAKE LOVE, DNA, BST, RUN and DOPE for their outfits and also to BULLETPFOOR Pt.2, NO MORE DREAM and N.O for their choreo IN the MV. The sets weren't luxurious and all that, but according to me, it fit the dance well and it isn\u2019t all that distracting.And the REAL reason I listen to BTS- I became an ARMY back in 2016, when I first saw BTS on a gloomy Friday evening (Note- They may have gained popularity through BST released on October, I became an ARMY on the HYYH:Young Forever era, and they weren\u2019t all that popular and had much haters still XP). I was off colour and I watched AHL and Bangtan Bombs and ARMY Rookie King (These are series created by Bighit starring BTS) it was really hilarious and I was drawn in by their characteristics. then came the MVs it was FOR YOU, and I loved it (Otaku listing to Japanese songs by some handsome dorks who are really funny\u2026 I was meant to fall fro them) Anyway, as I was saying, the real reason I listen to BTS is cause I like BTS, it\u2019s like even if they produced shitty music, I\u2019d not stop being an ARMY, because at one point of time, they were the \u2018unknown\u2019 k pop group that really made me happy. Though I say that if they produce shitty music, I\u2019m sure that they won\u2019t. They\u2019re getting better and better and better, and bigger and bigger and bigger. ",
