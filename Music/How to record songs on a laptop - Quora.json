            "answer_text": "This depends on what you\u2019re looking to accomplish. I use my set-up for light to moderate projects that include acoustic and electric guitar, vocals, synth, occassional percussion and for some heavier mastering and post-production work. If you\u2019re simply looking to capture scratch tracks, you just need an app for your phone. I recommend Spire, a free multi-track mobile app for musicians on-the-go. It\u2019s way more intuitive than GarageBand and it\u2019s great for capturing the moment. And it just sounds good. I used it to record this while traveling through Indonesia. If you\u2019re looking for something with a little more heft, you\u2019re going to need a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and there are several options to consider. You\u2019ll also need a good audio interface for your set-up and a computer with some good ram (8\u201316gb). Here are some suggestions. You\u2019ll also want a decent mic and stand. Shure makes good, durable and affordable microphones (SM-57, SM58), but nothing beats a quality condenser mic. Moving onto DAWs\u2026 I\u2019ve used Ableton Lite, which is the free version. While it doesn\u2019t provide all of the features of the paid version, it\u2019s enough to get you going, and there\u2019s some pretty decent on-board effects for tracking, mixing and mastering. For instance, I recorded this trackages ago with Ableton Lite and I\u2019m pretty happy with the finished product. Though I\u2019ve never used Logic Pro or Pre-Sonus, I\u2019ve worked with some people who have that swear by them. I eventually picked up Pro Tools, but you don\u2019t have to go this route unless you\u2019re handling some big mixing or sound design projects. [1] I do prefer it, but that\u2019s probably because I\u2019ve gotten confortable with the interface and controls. You can check out my most recent project, which I tracked, mixed and mastered through Pro Tools using my Zoom Tac-2 Thunderbolt interface and Macbook Pro. If you do decide to bite the bullet and pick up Pro Tools, there are some really great discounts available for students and educators; make sure to seek these out if you qualify. I\u2019ll leave you with one final note: A lot of people try to argue that Pro Tools is the only way to go, but there are some other options that are more affordable and might suit your needs better. Don\u2019t dismiss your own comfort level and trust your gut. You don\u2019t want to be slogging away for hours in a DAW that you don\u2019t like using. Remember, it\u2019s about finding what\u2019s right for you! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way i think is use a audio recording software to record music. GiliSoft Audio Recorder Pro is a perfect audio recorder to record computer sounds and microphone to AAC, AC3, AIFF, AMR, AU, FLAC, M4A, M4B, M4R, MKA, MP2, MP3, OGG, RA, VOC, WAV or WMA files on Windows 7/8. Recording the sound that goes through your audio card isn\u2019t at all a difficult task, but GiliSoft Audio Recorder Pro promises to make everything a lot easier, even for those with no advanced computer knowledge. 1) Allows you to pre-define recording qualities to help quickly set and manage recording parameters. 2) Allows you to start and stop recoding automatically with built-in timer. 3) Support silence detection during audio recording. 4) Built-in advanced sound engine to produce high quality recording. 5) Allows you to preset your recording device before start record.     Choose the 'Computer sounds\". You should now see a computer sounds waveform displayed on the window.  Choose the output audio format. If want to change the audio quality(Bit Rate), please click \"Settings\" button.  Click \"Record\" to start recording the computer sounds. ",

            "answer_text": "This sounds ridiculously simple, but the best way is to just get started. Make something. (I would also second the previous commenter: Audacity is great and free)  Do your best not to overthink it and just make some music. Far too many people obsess over what kind of \"gear\" they need and whether or not it will sound \"professional\" enough. The reality is that a great producer can make anything sound good (or at least better) no matter what gear they have.  When you need to learn how to do something specific Google is your best friend. The resources you'll need are easily found online and the laptop you have now is likely powerful enough to do anything you want if you're a beginner.   Just make stuff. Expect your first tries to be shitty. Expect to get better over time and eventually be embarrassed by your first tries. Keep those first efforts handy for those times when you need to remind yourself that the work really does pay off.   Hope that helps.   ",
