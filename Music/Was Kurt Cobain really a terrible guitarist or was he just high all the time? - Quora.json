            "answer_text": "There are so many misconceptions surrounding Kurt Cobain that, even though he is considered rock royalty, his legacy is not painted as an accurate depiction of the man. In one way, it is almost funny to me that many of the people who were jamming Nirvana in their heyday were not their intended audience and never have known many realities about the band that changed the face of music right in their faces. The beauty of it is they didn't want most of society to love them and most of their former, as well as current, \u201cfanbase\u201d is a cross section of the subjects of many of his songs. That information notwithstanding, both parts of the question are essentially fallible. One misunderstanding about Cobain is that he was a horrible guitarist. Of the more popular bands from that era, we\u2019ll say he is one of the \u201cleast good.\u201d Of couse, we are now comparing him to the likes of Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains and Kim Thayil of Soundgarden who has been named one of the top 100 guitarists of all time by Rolling Stone. But he wasn't a bad guitarist by any means. Kurt was not only a professional musician but the leader of one of the most successful bands of all time from any genre. Furthermore, he got consistenly better throughout his career. So, no. He wasn't a bad guitarist as many so called fans may purport. The second, and to me the most annoying, untruth about Kurt Cobain was that he was some space cadet who epitomized the life of a heroin junkie. Your thinking of the likes of Sid Vicious from the Sex Pistols. Or more in align with the time period, you could call out Layne Staley or Scott Weiland. Those two guys were notorious junkies whose successful careers were largely overshadowed by their crippling drug addictions. Kurt didn't do heroin at first. Then came the stress of being the biggest musical artist since John Lennon. Unlike Lennon, though, Cobain had trouble embracing his immense fame, largely because, as I touched on earlier, the fan base that surrounded him was not composed of the type of people that he felt was his target audience. He and Kris had formed a punk band who made songs downing the inconsiderate, popular, jocks they didn't like in school and now they suddenly filled the stands. Then, couple that stress with a pretty bad case of depression. The two amplified each other. He is said to have bad back problems, as well. Arguably his most crippling malady, though, was his persistent stomach pains. He went to doctors and there was no relief they could offer him. Now combine all those factors and imagine this guy out on tour trying to perform night after night under these conditions. But, he found an answer on tour. He found the relief that doctors could not prescribe. He found heroine. Sure, he had a heroin addiction and he was seen high a lot, especially close to the end of his career. Addiction is a progressive illness which only worsens a mental illness. The tragic flip side of that is that as depression worsens, so does your desire to check out, thereby temporarily relieving the depression. It is called a co-occuring disorder and is exponintially worse than having just one or the other. So, if you are interested in learning about Cobain and Nirvana, delve in and try to find the facts about their career. The story of Nirvana is a pretty interesting one and worth the time involved in learning about them. While you're at it, listen to each album at least a hundred times. It may take you that many times to figure out what the hell he was saying. ",

            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t say Kurt Cobain was a terrible guitarist. But he wasn\u2019t that good either. I will try to cut down some points to answer both of your questions. First of all, he was a grunge guitarist. Don\u2019t hate me for it, but most grunge guitarists are pretty limited in guitar skills. Especially when considering lead guitar. Comparing to hard rock, blues or heavy metal guitarists. However I don\u2019t compare lead guitar to rhythm guitar, but I always favor lead guitarists above rhythm guitarists who can play both lead and rhythm very well. For example, Jimmy Page,  Jimi Hendrix,  Ritchie Blackmore,  These three guitarists, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix and Ritchie Blackmore are well known for both lead guitar and rhythm guitar. They have some of the most recognizable guitar riffs and as well as guitar solos. All three of them, especially Ritchie Blackmore wrote easy guitar chords for riffs or difficult tons of notes for solos. Example, Smoke On the Water was a very easy guitar riff. On the other hand, solos like Stargazer, Gates of Babylon or the shredding he had done in 1960s were very difficult. But the thing is that all of them were sloppy. Especially on stages, but in studios? Not always. And one thing to remember, all three of them were drug addicted. Especially Page and Hendrix. And that made them sloppy. But in general, they weren\u2019t sloppy that much. So, drugs were the main reason behind their sloppy guitar performance. On the other hand these guitarists are not sloppy most of the time, Eric Johnson,  Mark Knopfler,  Rory Gallagher,  These three guitarists, Eric Johnson, Mark Knofpler and Rory Gallagher were very clean (least sloppy possible) guitarists when performing on stages. But they might have had drug issues. Can\u2019t say surely about Eric Johnson, but Knopfler and Rory may have. Mark Knopfler was very skinny in his early days. I assume because of his drug abuse. But he wasn\u2019t sloppy at all. He was always clean like studios. In fact, he was better on stages. And about Rory Gallagher, he was an alcoholic. But he too was very good on stages. In fact sometimes even better than studios. He didn\u2019t even lose vocals when performing. So, all three of them are technical,skilled but not sloppy. Might have been high sometimes. But that didn\u2019t affect them. So, I don\u2019t think being high is always the reason for being sloppy. Some people could be sloppy just for not focusing properly. And one more thing, Mark Knopfler was a lefty who used to play with right hand. He did it because so he could do strong vibratos with his left hand. So, Kurt isn\u2019t the only left out there. Michael Angelo Batio can play guitar with both hands. Also, Shawn Lane was a lefty,  But he could do some crazy picking with his right hand. At least, twice or thrice fast as Cobain. Not sloppy at all. And 10 times more emotional than Cobain. Don\u2019t mind. But that\u2019s reality. I didn\u2019t make that up. I am no anti-Kurt. Anyway now it goes to the real answering. Kurt Cobain was both high and had limited guitar skills. Being high made him sloppy. That\u2019s one reason to play wrong notes when performing. And being mostly a rhythm guitarist more than lead guitarist was something else. And no, it wasn\u2019t because of his addiction. It was because of limited guitar knowledge. Or simply his genre obstructed him. And now its simply upto you what you wanna hear and decide. Like I said, he was both sloppy and less skilled guitarist (compared to others). Jerry Garcia was also heavily addicted to drugs. But I don\u2019t mind his guitar playing or vocals. He was a very good rhythm guitar player. Johnny Ramone too was limited for lead guitar. But he cracked everybody\u2019s ass with his rhythm guitar playing. Now, most of the time I don\u2019t mind Kurt Cobain\u2019s guitar playing. But being less technical guitarist, and over than being sloppy, I don\u2019t consider that good. I mean, he\u2019s ok. Just OK. Not terrible, nor great. Just ok. I just don\u2019t consider him on the level of those guitarists who could play both rhythm and lead guitar, or who could stay clean for most of the time. ",
