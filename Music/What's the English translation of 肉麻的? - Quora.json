            "answer_text": "As with all such questions, the first answer is, \"There is no single translation,\" since any and all choices will be context-dependent.  Generally speaking, \u8089\u9ebb describes a reaction to a public display that crosses the bounds of taste into tackiness. If you were to hear a guy call his girlfriend \"Snookums,\" or something similarly cute without being ironic, the shudder that might give you would be \u8089\u9ebb. It's the same reaction northern Chinese get when they hear Taiwanese boys talk. Similarly, Hello Kitty - bordered booth photos of dippy girls puffing their cheeks out and V-signing is also \u8089\u9ebb. Oh, gross. It makes my flesh creep.  \"Makes my flesh creep\" is close to \u8089\u9ebb's literal meaning, but again, context will determine whether or not you're using it accurately or as a false positive. The English term can describe reactions of visceral disgust as opposed to derision, such as the sight of an opened corpse, and may thereby take the English in a direction you don't want it to go. ",
