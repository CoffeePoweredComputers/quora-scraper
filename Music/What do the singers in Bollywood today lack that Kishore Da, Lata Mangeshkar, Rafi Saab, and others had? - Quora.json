            "answer_text": "Very Good Question. I'll answer it in very simple words. The one thing that Singer of Present era lacks that (with due respect) Rafi, Lata, Kishore, Mukesh, Hemant Kumar, Asha bhosle and other legends of Bollywood Music Industry had\u2026.is nothing! Yes, you read it right..they lack Absolutely Nothing. The great legends of the past had few things as advantage- Perception: That Time, working in movie, that too in Music Industry was not considered as a reputed job. As a result, only a few talent happen to reach Bollywood.Producer's choice: At that time producer's were not so much Flexible as that of the Present time. Previously Singer used to be the Voice of Hero but Today even Rahat Fateh Ali Khan gives his voice to Salman Khan in one songs, in another song of the same movie Mika sings.Sentimental Connection: The Viewers had Sentimental Connection with the singer/Emotional Attachment, leaving producers and composer in no choice but to sign the particular artist for their album/movie.Monopoly in Music Industry: Even singers have their monopoly in the Industry. For an instance, singer used to refuse working in future projects with composer if he signs another singer for a song. Which means no matter what the composer had to sign that Singer.Also, Lack of Platform to search and bring the Talent. (Like we have so many singing reality shows) was a major reason composers were not having much choices. Ps. There's no doubt all the singers of the Past time were really very talented, highly skilled. Several Hits, So many success stories. I personally like Rafi saahab. One may disagree to what I have mentioned, but for an instance just imagine- Arijit Singh, KK, Kailash Kher, Shankar Mahadevan, Shreya Ghoshal, Monali Thakur, etc in the times of Rafi Sahab or Kishor dada. They would also have written a great Success story if they were in that golden era of Bollywood Music Industry. Also I would like to mention, personally I also think we can also consider Udit Narayan, Kumar Sanu, Sonu Nigam and Sunidhi Chauhan as the Legends of Modern Times. Because they have given their voice for almost every type of Songs for Decades. They also have success stories. They grew up listening to Rafi sahab, Kishor da\u2026and present generation of singers idolize Sonu Nigam,KK,Sunidhi, Udit Narayan or Kumar Sanu. In the present times due to too many talents in music industry we have so many music composers, the reality shows proved themselves as great platform to bring forward the fresh talent. The Economy has risen as compared to past times. Now a days every week we have atleast 4 movies to arrive on cinema. Working is fast. Composers are now music machines. They have to produce songs really fast. I think there's low in music, as music of present times doesn't has longitivity. That's why sings now a days are hard to remember I.e. they are not long lasting. Forget about being evergreen. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not think that the present day singers are any short on talent as compared to those of yesteryear. Not including the great Kishore Kumar who was a class apart from everyone else anyway. If anything, the technological advances in sound engineering have meant that any rough edges the singers have can be smoothed out in post production treatment. The reasons why present day singers do not catch the imagination as compared to Lata Mangeshkar, Rafi, Kishore Kumar etc are a combination of many factors as under: There are many more singers around and the space that each of them get is limited. The numbers are high because there are many more avenues to showcase talent and be noticed.The importance of melodies in movies has reduced. What sells is fast and racy songs that are good to dance to. This means music directors are not putting in as much effort. More and more efforts are being put in introducing foot tapping music, often generated electronically.Songs, 30 and more years ago, often advanced the plot or brought hidden emotions to fore. They no longer have that purpose. Why would poets strain? They need to ensure that there is some semblance of a rhyme, sometimes even that is not needed. Remember Phulari bina chatni kaise bani?To conclude. What the modern day singers lack is quality content to work with and demand for melody. Talent, they have but that in itself is not enough to create memorable music. ",

            "answer_text": "According to many eminent people, the most important cause of the decline is deficiency of melody. In other words the music directors are not playing their roles well and good. Some 50 years back, we had some classic directors like SD Burman, Madan Mohan, and Shankar-Jaikishan. Even in the 89s era showed melodies. But ever since the death of the veteran composer RD Burman, the song quality has gone down beyond limits. Not that every song is as drastic. Songs by Pritam, Anupam Roy, and Jeet Ganguly are good. However, opinions vary. Singers were there, are there and will be there. But, can you compare Teri Aankhon Ke Siva Duniya Mein Kya Rakhha Hai with Main Tera Boyfriend, Tu Meri Girlfriend?? You cannot, you must not. THANKS FOR READING. ",

What the yesterday legends had was the inner feelings in their voices, and the exceptional talent and melody that their voices had. They did not have many chances, and they had to give most of the songs in ne take only. The quality and the melody of the music was so good, that the songs are still widely appreciated and loved. I'm not criticizing the talent of singers from today, but as we can all see, that in today\u2019s generation, many OLD songs are being re-mixed and remastered, so that people love them all over again. hope my answer helps ;-) ",
