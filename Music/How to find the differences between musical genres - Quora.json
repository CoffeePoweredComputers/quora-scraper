            "answer_text": "Oh man, this one is not so much difficult as it is long winded and subjective. I\u2019ll try to make this as fast as I can and limit it too the core of genres so it easier and I\u2019m old and don\u2019t get half of what the genres are these days. But here we go! We will start with classical. Why? Because it\u2019s an old one that almost everything bases itself off of. When we started (as humans) composing scores, we had orchestras! So naturally that\u2019s what was written for. Back then people respected musicians that could play so lots of really intricate movements and melodies. That and it set the tone for pretty much all other musical genres that we know in the western world. Almost everything uses the same scales and theory to write in. So, we move on! Lets take a shot at jazz next. A whole genre dedicated to improvisation and so, so many notes. Whether it be cool jazz, hot jazz, they all come from the same background. They all follow the idea from classical as well to use theory and scales in it\u2019s fullest. Some jazz songs can use darn near every note in the book, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, showing your muscle as a musician. The drummers for jazz are the epitome of \u201cin the pocket\u201d, the guitar players use chords and scales rarely used by anyone else, and the bass players, they find the groove in pretty much anything. They also tend to set the tone of what the song is going to feel like. Going on, we hit country/western. In its original days, it was about writing simple songs note wise and focusing more on lyrics. Unless you moved into the bluegrass area where as it\u2019s more like country jazz. But country was more about getting out emotion. Singing a song about a love lost or a life broken. Something generally tragic in life. Not always, but lets face it, life was hard back in the 1800s so they would generally have a lot of sorrow to song about. But some were happier dancy tunes as well. Move on later still to rock. Rock kind of embodied all of these genres with the added point of energy and attitude. Think about how rock used to represent itself. Loud, in your face, energy, ect. Improvisation from jazz, guitar solos rooted in classical theory, lyrics that sometimes came from the sadder side of country. Hell, they used a lot of riff from country that blues just slowed down. We can\u2019t talk about rock without blues. Blues really set the tone for modern music as we know it today. Blues had the sad lyrics (generally about hard life as a slave) and simple songs. But truly a mountain of emotion. The cousin of blues, R&B, was a truly the bases of modern hip hop and rap tunes. The basis of those genres were from it. From old R&B came Motown. Motown was the natural next move for R&B. Got a good singer? Really let them do their thing in Motown. Harmony for days. Melody that simply can\u2019t be matched. Which brings us too what we hear most of today. Electronic R&B/hip hop/edm. All made to make you want to dance for the most part. Rap can be more about a message, but mostly people listen too it because they want to shake their booty. There are lots and LOTS of subgenres around all of these but I wanted to stick with the core genres and not make this too long winded as this is my break time and I only have so much time to ramble on. I hope this helps in some capacity and when in doubt, just youtube a blanket search like \u201cclassical music\u201d or \u201cjazz music\u201d and you can start to discern the differences for yourself. They all have their goods and bads, but it\u2019s all music and everyone has their taste too it, find yours!!!! Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "Well, music genres are countless indeed. If you are talking about theory and song structure, it\u2019s different in popular (pop) music, jazz, blues, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, rap, hip-hop, electronic, etc\u2026 But if you are talking about characteristics, added elements and themes; then they will be very difficult to differentiate by time. As a rock/metal music fan, 10 years ago, I was capable to differentiate between heavy metal, and glam metal, death metal and grind-core metal, but now it\u2019s about adding elements above each other, so don\u2019t be surprised to find a band playing Atmospheric Doom/Ambient Electronic Metal! And after all this; I preferred to go back to roots, so whatever metal sub-genre is, I call it Metal (or as known as; heavy metal) and if it\u2019s death/doom, blackend, I preferred to simply call it, extreme metal. Anyhow, my advise is you listen to many styles as much as you can. By time, this will help much especially if you are composing your own music. ",
