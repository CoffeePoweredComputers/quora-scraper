But despite \u201cGood Morning to You\u201d being out of cooyright, music publisher Warner Chappel claimed that the lyrics to the song \u201cHappy Birthdays\u201d were actually resulted in the song being rewritten and copyrighted in 1935, and a royalty had to be paid for any public use of Happy Birthday A court case in 2013 resulted in $14m of royalties being repaid to filmmakers and other users who the court concluded had overpaid royalties in prior years It was even claimed the daughter of the song lyrics writer was a co-writer on the song thereby potentially extending the copyright from the 70 years after the date of the death of the songwriter that would otherwise have applied In 2008 the song was reported to be earning Warner\u2019s $2m per annum.

            "answer_text": "Strangely enough, the song \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d has made approximately $60 million in its lifetime, the most money that any song has ever earned. Technically, you were supposed to pay $25,000 for every performance of the song in a non-familial setting (like an office party), which is why you hear places do their own \u201cbirthday song.\u201d But it has since moved into public domain. The Top Five are pretty interesting (as of 2017): 1. \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d2. \u201cYou\u2019ve Lost That Lovin\u2019 Feeling\u201d3. \u201cYesterday\u201d 4. \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d5. \u201cStand By Me\u201d \u201cYesterday\u201d is the song that has been \u201ccovered\u201d (rerecorded) the most times, with over 2200 artists having done the song.
