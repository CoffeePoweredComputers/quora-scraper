            "answer_text": "Casting is a good possibility. Usually they are actresses or dancers or whatever. It means, they are professionals or at least semi professionals (therefore they don\u2019t look ridiculous). And I assume they get paid, however the single agreements might change on a case by case basis. One point is: if they were amateurs and don\u2019t get paid, a mistake or a distraction (say, one is putting the finger in the nose) can cost minutes of filming. And usually you can\u2019t afford loosing too much time when you have tons of persons and rented a space, etc. It is better, more efficient and \u201ccheaper\u201d to work with professionals. And that means: fees. If your question behind the question is that you want to apply, better ask another question from zero. There are several people that could help with that as well.
