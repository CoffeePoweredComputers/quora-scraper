            "answer_text": "An obsession with watching YouTube covers led to the singer posting his own across social media, which he describes as \u201ca habit and a fun thing to do after school in a boring town.\u201d He became determined to pursue it, taking vocal lessons and idolizing Ed Sheeran, the template for Mendes' songwriting and career. He is the first artist to become world famous and score a record deal using the Vine app. ... He was discovered by Andrew Gertler (Artist Manager) in 2013 from posting singing vines, and YouTube covers that got him a lot of attention. Gertler then brought him to Island records where Shawn got signed in May 2014. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Learn To Sing material there... ",

Every voice is unique, and trying to be someone else is not going to help you much. I'd rather listen to covers who have different voices and different styles than to hear the same song trying to be interpreted by someone else. ",
