            "answer_text": "Hy there! Single - A song which was released alone. Song - Can be released as a single or with album. Every Single is a Song but every Song is not a Single. Whenever a new album is announced, some of its songs are released as Single. To get some publicity so people buy that album after it is released. Mostly Singles have a dedicated music video to them. But other songs in an album don't.  Hope this helps. ",
