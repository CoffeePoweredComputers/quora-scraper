            "answer_text": "I have never heard that particular story. Playing high in trumpet or any brass instrument is sort of like breaking boards in Karate demonstrations. Done right, the board breaks, done wrong, the hand breaks. Embouchures ( the lips, face, tongue, where the face meets the horn) are personal and free advice given here or facebook or some media is worth what you paid for. To stay out of trouble and get good results fastest you need a good teacher. I don\u2019t know where you live but here are some resources to help you: Trumpetherald.com, BBtrumpet.com. TPIN ( a mailing list), Wilktone.com( mainly for trombones but a lot of good advice and information). A lot of very good teachers Skype. Off hand I can think of Jeanne Pocius, John Mohan, and Rich Willey ( not sure if Rich teaches but he would know where to find a good teacher). On youtube Greg Spence has some very good videos, some aimed beginners. Good luck. Trust me, if I can do it anyone can. It just takes work and a good teacher ",

            "answer_text": "First, you can be led astray by thinking that there is a special technique for playing high. There is now \u201clow\u201d \u2018middle\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d register on trumpet; the aim is to create as seamless a delivery as possible. As with singing the aim is to add a semitone to your register per week, or month, or as long as it takes until it becomes part of your \u201cnormal\u201d range. The search for extended range on the trumpet appears to have begun with Louis Maggio who sought to rehabilitate himself following a devastating lip injury. Subsequent \u201chigh note\u201d methods have been built on extending the lower end as well as the high \u201cinto the \u201cpedal\u201d register. To built a high-rise block you have to dig the foundations deep into the earth. Sound is what matters most of all. ",
