            "answer_text": "This is the second question that I\u2019m answering with you as the author. I did a little background search and now I know that you\u2019re new here. BTS is a K-pop group that is successful worldwide. Their fans are called ARMY ARMY is abbreviated to Adorable Representatives and MCs for Youth. Army is any fan of BTS. ARMY IS THIS  NOT THIS  ARMY is a group of beautiful-hearted people who spread happiness and positivity all over the world and do whatever it takes to save BTS from any harm, not physical harm like gunshots but mental harm like cyber hating, bad people who spread hate and toxic people who call themselves \u201cARMY\u201d And the army that you\u2019re probably asking about is a group of people who do whatever it takes to save their country from harm. See the connection with the words and roles. Okay, okay, now back to your question. NO, BTS WILL NOT PERFORM A CONCERT WITH EITHER THEIR FANS OR THE REAL ARMY. Because there is a risk there, what if the fan they choose to perform with does any harm to them? And the real army would probably be too busy meeting their families and saving their country. Let\u2019s end this on a good note, with this gif.  Make sure to search for DYNAMITE on YouTube! ",

I don't really know when that's going to happen.. but this is my opinion\u2026 Corona is still spreading and it is said that Vaccine for it has also been found and it is being tested on people of different countries to see whether it's working or not\u2026 They are still working on it. Until then, we ARMY(s) should wait to see how and when BTS will perform live with ARMY(s) on stage. It hasn't been declared that they'd perform or not\u2026 ",
