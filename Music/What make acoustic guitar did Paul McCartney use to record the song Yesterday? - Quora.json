            "answer_text": "Like Rolf Fahl\u00e9n already stated, Paul recorded \u201cYesterday\u201d on his Epiphone (by Gibson) 1964, FT-79 Texan. He bought it at the end of August 1964 at Manny\u2019s in New York City. It had a Natural coloured solid spruce top, a mahogany back and sides, with serial number 194959. It was sold in the US at the time for about 1000 pounds in today\u2019s money. It\u2019s a right-handed model that Paul turned upside down and he had it strung left-handed. He also used it for live performances of \u201cYesterday\u201d during The Beatles years and beyond, although during the Wings\u2019years he also used a Gibson or Ovation while performing the song. In 1976, while performing in Detroit with Wings, Paul stuck a Red Wings sticker of the Detroit NHL hockey team, given by a fan, on this guitar, and it has been there ever since. When Pail played in Pittsburgh in August 2010, Pittsburgh\u2019s fans, seeing hem play with a sticker of their rival hockey team, asked the Pittsburgh Mayor to convince Paul to add a Pittsburgh Penguins sticker to the guitar, which Paul did. He hasn\u2019t played it live anymore for a couple of years now, since \u201cYesterday\u201d hasn\u2019t been on his set list lately. ",
