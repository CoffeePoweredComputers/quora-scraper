            "answer_text": "It depends on what kind of sound you\u2019re seeking. Remember, no rules in electric guitar music. Some of the most revered bass players in history didn\u2019t use bass amps.  Here\u2019s James Jamerson playing through a Fender Dual Showman with Marvin Gaye. There are many others. Carol Kaye played through a Fender Super Reverb for about a gazillion hit records. Lemmy Kilmister used a Marshall Super Lead. Kris Novocelic played through a Fender Twin before Never Mind. The amp itself won\u2019t be bothered by having a bass plugged in. It cares somewhat about what impedance is plugged into the jack, but a bass guitar signal has close to the same impedance as an electric guitar. Bass frequencies, however, can be below the normal range of guitar speakers. This can cause excessive wear as the speaker attempts to vibrate wider than it was designed for (bass frequencies have longer wavelengths, so speakers have to move farther to create them). If your amp has a closed-back (enclosed) cabinet around the speaker, it helps. If the amp has an open back, stuff a pillow or something to close it up. The extra air pressure helps the speaker deal with long extrusions. As long as you don\u2019t overdrive the speakers too much, you can get away with using a bass with many amplifiers. Don\u2019t let this stop you from playing and practicing until you can get a \u201creal\u201d bass amp. Or stick a bass speaker in the guitar amp in between. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question is \u201c is it bad\u201d. The answer is yes. Here is why. Amplifier wise it makes little difference although bass preamps and power amps are set up specifically to put out the lower notes that a bass can reach that a guitar cannot. Here is the other issue. Bass frequencies require more power to cleanly reproduce than do guitar frequencies. As you are probably aware most guitarists want their amps at a certain part to break up or distort. Most Bass players want to get as clean and punchy a sound as they can get- they are opposites. Also, if you ever look at the cones of guitar speakers, the paper on them is very thin- that is the help reproduce the notes of the guitar. A bass speakers cone is very stiff and rigid. That is what helps to produce the clean punchy sound of the Bass. So can you use a guitar amp- sure. Is it bad? Yes. Played at high volume for a long time you will likely damage the speakers and in all likelihood not get the sound that you were looking for to begin with. ",
