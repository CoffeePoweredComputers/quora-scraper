            "answer_text": "Interesting question, alcohol makes me want to listen to music that I wouldn't normally play, and makes you want to go to a gig or concert, it has had this effect on me for decades. The other thing, is that at the weekends, they put on these things, so you anticipate having a drink, just because you know that there is something going on in town. Most of the time, you know that it is going to sound good, and by being there in person, you can have some influence on the band that are playing, by influencing those that choose to dance/jig/headbang/pogo/mosh etc. ",
