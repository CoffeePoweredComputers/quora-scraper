            "answer_text": "Yes and No. Yes, mental states can definitely effect/affect the body. This really what \u201c*Psychosomatization\u201d really is. (A term that is regularly used incorrectly). Though it in itself, poor mental health will not cause death. The neglect of the care of the body and poor decisions and poor living habits, e.g.; poor hygiene, poor nourishment, lack of sunlight, sleep deprivation, over sleeping, lack of physical exercise, and picking up bad habits such as smoking, alcohol and drug use. In addition to some who also self harm. If thier immune system is weakened they are also more susceptible to infection from all of the above and the combination of all the aformentioned. It's really a bad way to go. There's a great deal of suffering and it is a slow death, years, sometimes decades to succumb to wasting due to cognitive behavioral dysfunction and apathy. Which can result in physical wasting, physical and mental deterioration, and failure to thrive. In addition, it also takes a toll on the people around them. Eventually, most people get fed up and move on with thier lives. Leaving the patient to waste alone. Often, for years. Unfortunately, I have seen this a few times more than I care to admit. After the demise or in the end stages, those contacted often said, they tried and often. But the patient wouldn't help themselves and they honestly just got fed up with it. Though, they were sad to see thier loved one in this situation. Life goes on, even if the patient didn't. The dying die. The living go on living. It's a sad and pathetic way to go. The longer the patient waited, the worse it got. The more of a burden they became on thier loved ones. When people are very depressed they often get sucked up into thier own self. Often not realizing there are other people that they are effecting. Like the depressed patient. The other's also have thoughts and emotions. People, all people are entitled to these things. After a while, the others often grow weary trying to help \u201cSave\u201d the patient. Though we can't control our thoughts and emotions. The things we think, the things we feel. We can control our behavior. The things we say and do. How we react. If you feel this way or someone you know. Please get help ASAP. The sooner the better. Even if you pick up the phone and call 911. To get things moving. The longer one waits, the worse it gets. I have also seen patients come back from this \u201cApathy\u201d & \u201cHopelessness\u201d. Often bouncing back quicker then they imagined. If I had a dollar for every time I heard, \u201c I wish I would've done this (got help) sooner\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the yes and no. However, I would like to share a personal insight to this. I hit the rare disorder lottery in my 20\u2019s. It was misdiagnosed for years and years and every time I tried to get a diagnosis, I was treated like it was in my head or it was something else (my disorder is one of exclusion and mimics other diagnoses). After years of fighting on my own behalf, specialists FINALLY said yes, it is \u201cthis\u201d. I am now on TNF meds because it is aggressive. About 7 years ago, I started experiencing extreme pain into my eyes, cheeks, jaw, and head. Doctors dismissed it as headaches and somatic pain disorder (basically saying it was all in my head); but because my disorder affects every type of blood vessel of all sizes, I am at higher risk for neurological problems. In 2019, the pain became so unbearable that I was suicidal because it seemed the only way to be free of the pain. Imagine if you can, a headache that never goes away but it's not your head; it's your face. Late last year I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia type II, the rarer form of the disorder. This was after being on suicide watch for six months. I am now on two separate medications, one of which has awful side effects and if I don't take it every three hours, I cannot function but that is the price I am willing to pay to have significantly reduced pain. I have fibromyalgia, Behcet's, and TNII. I cannot do the things I used to do because pain and fatigue limit my life. I stay in a constant depression and have anxiety and hardly leave my house. Does my physical health affect my mental health? Absolutely! Is the reverse true? Absolutely. Can I die from the second? Yes, but only if I neglect the first and the black hole that hangs at the edge of my conscience tells me it's not worth it. Moral to the story; advocate for yourself and recognize when you need to reach out to make sure your mental health is supported. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, mental health and physical health are directly related and affect one another and, yes, people with serious mental illness die from its effects on their physical health. People with serious mental illness have a statistically significantly lower life expectancy, at least here in the US. From the National Institute of Mental Health a few years ago: Five years ago, Colton and Mandersheidi surveyed mortality data from eight states and concluded that, on average, Americans with major mental illness die 14 to 32 years earlier than the general population. The average life expectancy for people with major mental illness ranged from 49 to 60 years of age in the states they examined \u2014 a life span on par with many sub-Saharan African countries, including Sudan (58.6 years) and Ethiopia (52.9 years).ii Average life expectancy in the United States is 77.9 years.iii It would appear that the increase in longevity enjoyed by the general U. S. population over the past half century has been lost on those with serious mental illness (SMI). In fact, this drop in life expectancy due to mental illness would surpass the health disparities reported for most racial or ethnic groups. Yet this population is rarely identified as an underserved or at-risk group in surveys of the social determinants of health. iv Why is there such a profound disparity in life expectancy for those with SMI? Disorders such as schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder are risk factors for suicide, but most people with SMI do not die by suicide. Rather, the 5 percent of Americans who have SMI die of the same things that the rest of the population experiences \u2014 cancer, heart disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and diabetes. They are more likely to suffer chronic diseases associated with addiction (especially nicotine), obesity (sometimes associated with antipsychotic medication), and poverty (with its attendant poor nutrition and health care) and they may suffer the adverse health consequences earlier.

            "answer_text": "Yes. I was very stressed at work. I didn't realise it at the time, I thought I was ok. But my physical health was deteriorating. At first I was dizzy, feeling faint light headed, kind of thing. It started getting worse so I started to see a doctor and was referred for tests. As I was in going tests nothing was changing and my health got worse. My arms would feel like lead weights and I would be unable to lift them. I would be unable to walk at a normal pace, it was like signals telling my legs to move would not reach them. I would lose my balance, not being able to walk in a straight line (falling off the curb or into fences). A few times my hearing went, another my sight started to go, these did not last long. My head would all of a sudden feel like a bowling ball and I would have to lay down. They are a few others I cannot remember at this time. When I eventually left work my physical health got a lot worse. I couldn't walk far, I even struggled to get to the doctors which was 15min away. At home I couldn't stand for more than a few minutes. Making a cup of tea was out of the question as the effort of just getting up to put the kettle on would cause me to have to sleep for a few hours to recover. I had to sleep for a few hours just so I could pick my son up from school (a few minutes walk) It took months to recover and I still to this day have no idea what happened and why. I did find out that I had been having several panic attacks every day for years whilst at work, I just didn't realise it at the time. I thought I wasn't stressed and I was ok, my body told me otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "The short, short summary is that bipolar people (my area of interest) have elevated risks higher rates of death from natural causes due to their physical health. The natural causes can be mitigated by good general health care. And, something to keep in mind is the methodology of the study. http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psyc... Suicide was substantially more common accounting for 5% of deaths among women and 10% among men with bipolar versus 1% and 2% among the general population. Unintentional injuries were also a 10-fold higher risk for women and eight-fold higher risk among men with bipolar disorder after adjustment for age and other factors. Looking just at death from natural causes, the bipolar patients died roughly 7 years earlier than those without the disorder. The deaths elevated among bi-polar patients are: Influenza or pneumonia, elevated 3.7-fold among women and 4.4-fold among men Diabetes, elevated 3.6-fold among women and 2.6-fold among men Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), elevated 2.9-fold among women and 2.6-fold among men Stroke, elevated 2.6-fold among women but not men Cancer, elevated 40% among women but not menColon cancer, elevated 2.1-fold among women, albeit based on only 13 deaths Finally, I want to mention from this article Mortality Among Bipolar and also from some general knowledge I have that bipolar people have more concurrent health problems, medication side-effects, likelihood of substance abuse, concurrence of other mental illnesses, less access to healthcare depending on their employment, whether they are on federal disability, and their likelihood of searching for healthcare, and that being bipolar is a HUGE stress on the overall well-being of the physical body. That one I know from personal experience. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all we should be aware of both mental and physical health and let\u2019s try to explore more on this topic. What is physical health? Answer to this question is that it is condition of body where you are not able to do any work physically because of your bad health as bad diet , bad lifestyle and this results into some basic in efficiency to do any work and it may cause illness, you may get tired and of-course it may badly affect your mental health but one can not take any extreme step only because of poor physical health until it affects mental health. Now let\u2019s move on mental health. What is mental health?? As we all know that mind/brain is boss of our body. Our single body part cannot even move without the proper functioning of mind. So when we talk about mental it automatically implies full body health that includes mental and physical health both. If you brain is not healthy then your body automatically becomes in-efficient. So it is very important to take care of our brain/mind that means mental health should be very proper with proper physical health. But it differs with physical health in this case that mentally disturbed people can take any extreme step that should not be taken. Also there is an idiom : Healthy mind lives in Healthy body. So take care of your body as well as your brain. Some tips to maintain your mental health proper : a) Take good diet: It is also said that breakfast should be very good an healthy because breakfast directly relates to our mind and thus breakfast is also known as brain-food. b) Meditation: It is the best way to be filled up with positive energy and positive thought but one thing we should always remember that meditation must be done in open air and during sunrise.(As written in our great ancient Indian meditation books ) . c) Be happy and always positive :Don\u2019t let negative things come to you ever.Always be happy and share your feelings either it is of joy or sad and never be sad of anthing you tried for and didn\u2019t get. d) Be with your family : Always remember when there is no-one with you there is always a family that will stand with you in whatever condition you are. No one is as much motivator as family so share your thoughts and feelings with your family and absolutely they are enough experienced to let you know the solution of your problem. Here ,a very useful resource that is dToks | Talks that De-Tox, a podcast where people from different backgrounds come together to speak on topics related to mental health .Hope it may help many of people who are suffering from mental health problem and there is not any problem to use atleast once this resource may be some one can get a huge benefit from dTox.

There is a disorder that makes a person make others sick so that they can sweep in and save them, this has been known to kill people. People with depression will stop taking care of themselves, including not eating, drinking, exercising or sleeping. This can make them very sick, if it is too long before anyone checks on them, they can die. Depression can also cause a person to become suicidal. People with mania have been known to do some really risky behaviors. Sometimes a person can feel invincible, it can put your physical health at risk. Similarly, your physical health can also affect your mental health, and it can turn into a vicious cycle. ",

Lack of initiatives and lust for life which can lead to depression which can again lead to suicide. Underweight and malnourishment caused by the lack of appetite caused by depression. Etcetera. Medication and depression may also lead a person to be less socially active and lack of social contact also pose a heath problem. * Accidents caused by lack of concentration and focus due to depression. Accidents caused by the person overestimating his or her capacities (for example during mania). Etcetera. ",

            "answer_text": "There is always a misconception in people's minds about the relationship between mental and physical health. They are often thought to be separate entities but they are connected. If a person's mental health is not sub-par then there is a high chance of it affecting your physical well being. Hence, YES bad mental health does affect physical health. Also, there is always an association seen between mental illness and depression. One needs to understand that mental health is not only related to one's depression there are other illnesses that are related to mental health like Anxiety disorders, Schizophrenia, Eating disorders, Bipolar depression, etc. to name a few. To answer the second part of the question: NO, If your mental health is so unhealthy that it affects your physical health badly, can you die from it. Rather it can lead to several health complications : Heart diseaseHigh blood pressureWeakened immune systemAsthmaObesityGastronomical problemsHence if you are facing mental health issues or physical health issue please talk to someone or find like-minded individuals for having meaningful discussions about mental health, as an ambassador at dToks I suggest you join https://www.facebook.com/groups/dToks/ ",

Mental illness causes physical distress and that distress causes even more mental health problems. Especially if you are not sure where does the problem come from, is it the mind or the body\u2026it\u2019s important to not get misdiagnosed so you can cure or at least treat your simptoms fairly. Make sure to visit some specialists rather sooner than later. As for the second part of the question, at least I haven\u2019t died yet and I don\u2019t know if am going to, although it always feels like I am about to die directly from an anxiety/panic attack. Depression also causes a horrible suffocating feeling. But I guess one is more likely to commit suicide rather than die from mental illness itself. ",

I recommend that you get your genes mapped to see what mutations you might have that could be contributing to both any mental health issues you might have and any physical health issues you might have. See 23andme dot com DNA Genetic Testing & Analysis - 23andMe and genetic genie dot org Methylation and detox analysis from 23andMe results for more info on this. Look for any MTHFR mutations or CBS 699 mutations or SUOX mutations etc. Here is an article from Psychology Today that talks about the MTHFR mutation that causes folate/folic acid absorbing problems, so causes folate/folic acid deficiency, and thus can cause both mental and physical problems since you can have both mental and physical problems if you are very deficient in folate/folic acid and or other B complex vitamins and magnesium.

I didn\u2019t take very good care of my body as far as eating healthy, exercise, getting sun, watching my weight, etc. I also took a medication called Seroquel. Within a year I had diabetes. The medicine itself had been found to cause that. (I was part of a class action suit). My primary physician said although it played a role, I was probably pre-diabetic when I started taking the med. Although it can be handed down by genetics, not keeping my body, and actions and behaviors healthy had greatly contributed to the diabetes. If I had taken care of myself I could have stayed healthy. And there are complications from it that can cause you to lose feet, eyesight and many other things. So my mental illness and depression made it so I did t care. ",

            "answer_text": "Mental illness MIGHT cause a person to pay less attention to their physical health. Generally, treatment helps a person to get on with all the little details of life that contribute to good health - getting annual checkups, brushing teeth, seeing a dentist, eating good food and getting daily exercise. So for example, my friend with untreated schizophrenia was very listless. He didn\u2019t have the energy to cook and was too paranoid to go to a store or restaurant or to get annual physical exams. As a result he ate poorly - he would eat a box of candy instead of a meal with protein, vegetables and healthier ingredients. He also did not brush his teeth or go to the dentist. I always worried that an infected tooth could lead to an infection in a heart valve or other important structure of the heart. After 50 years of this he was overweight and had mild signs of heart disease. ",

People with mental health disorders usually are not eating in the healthy 3 meals a day so, usually their body systems including their gut health isn\u2019t healthy which has been shown to be an important factor in mental health. The types of food that people eat, affects how the person feels in a positive or negative way. Processed foods usually make people feel sluggish and just off, while lean meat, fruit and vegetables give energy and can change the chemicals released by the brain.

Poor mental health can cause an increased reaction to stressful situations. Researchers have tied stress to cancer and other diseases.

The lack of a proper diet and adequate sleep lower the person\u2019s immune system which makes them more prone to getting sick. Anxiety can also cause irritable bowels which is not a good situation.
