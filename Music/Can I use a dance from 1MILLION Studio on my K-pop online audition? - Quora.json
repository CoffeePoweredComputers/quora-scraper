            "answer_text": "Of course you can, you can use any song you want to, as long as it is up to your ability. Never aim for something that you cannot reach because it will only be your downfall and highlight of your weaknesses. When you do pick one, remember to dance to it with the same emotions they do, because only then can truly show them emotions of the dance, and really impress the judges like the person did, to you. You have to deliver the same impact, the same energy, the same aura, stage presence, and maybe, improvise by adding a bit of your flair. Don't completely, follow their every step, you can always add a bit of your own flavor, for an additional layer, so it can be unique as well. I think you would do great, if you can be able to prefect those moves and really dealer the perfect performance from beginning to end. If not, then hat I suggest is doing a dance that suits you and don't think about doing something that is impressive, and simply doesn't fit your style well, it is all about what you can do and who you are as a trainee, not reflecting the quality of others and what they can do, so do what is best for you, or maybe king your own choreography, but only if you are up for it and ambitious towards that goal, I think if you were to do one that is self choreographed, it would only show another layer of skill, from you, but if you can\u2019t do it or are not willing, don't push yourself. You will only be more liable of failing if you are doing something you are not willing to do. So just do what you want, and do it to the best of your ability. Good luck and I hope you succeed. ",

If not, it may seem as though you're passing it off as your own and we don't do plagiarism lol. Also, make sure its a well-known song, but if its not, that's okay as well considering if the choreo is just THAT goood. I hope that helps! ",
