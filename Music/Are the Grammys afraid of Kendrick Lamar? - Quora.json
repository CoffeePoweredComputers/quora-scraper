            "answer_text": "I want to start off by saying that in the grander scheme of things, the Grammys mean absolutely nothing. Your success, relevance, productivity, and overall artistic excellence are not dependent on the spotty track records of the National Recording Academy and they never will be. Regardless if they\u2019re informed on the landscape of music and musicianship or not, they\u2019re just someone with an albeit unsupported opinion. Leave them be. But, Jesus Christ.  Maybe the biggest snub ever. And I don\u2019t see much of argument against this. In a previous answer, I predicted, but not explicated stated, DAMN. would win Album of The Year at the Grammy\u2019s. DAMN. was the fastest selling and I\u2019m very sure (couldn\u2019t find the exact numbers) best-selling nominated album at the Grammy\u2019s this year. This is especially noteworthy considering DAMN. was released in April of 2017, while 24K Magic hit the markets over a year before (November of 2016). Their total sales are comparable despite Mars having sixteen months to rack up revenue to Lamar\u2019s nine. So, a factor that the Grammy\u2019s have historically favored goes to Lamar.  Secondly, DAMN. was widely, and I mean widely, considered the best album of 2017. Music publications and writers alike celebrated the record as yet another triumph for the Compton-born musician, who we can without bias say is on pace to a legendary status. Such a continuum of reverence should be some sort of factor; it\u2019s exceptionally rare to see such accordance for an album, especially a prominent one. This only occurs when whatever was presented was unequivocally estimable. At least 18 different publications chose DAMN. as the best album of the year. At least another eight chose it as the 2nd best. The 2nd most frequently cited album was Lorde\u2019s Melodrama, where it was selected as the best album of 2017 by at least 10 different publications, and ranked #2 by at least another six. Mars failed to even be ranked at all in some instances, let alone ranked at the top. Other ratings gave average and just favorable reviews. Meaning that a bulk of critics, people who aren\u2019t just casual listeners mind you, saw some something lacking in his repertoire.  The only real argument against Kendrick Lamar is his very limited set of skills. He is just a performer of Hip Hop, and a songwriter. He isn\u2019t a producer. He\u2019s not an audio engineer. He doesn\u2019t mix. He doesn\u2019t play any instruments. And he isn\u2019t an adept dancer. Lamar can offer his artistic vision, as in explaining what exact sounds he desires, and can convey particular nuances he wants to accompany him in the instrumentation, but, to my knowledge, can\u2019t actually make that happen himself. As commendable as his album is, there\u2019s an entire component he has just about zero involvement in. Bruno Mars is not only a singer and songwriter. He\u2019s a multi-instrumentalist\u2014 capable of playing the drums, piano, guitar, and keyboard, in addition to producing and dancing competency. He\u2019s yet to ooze with virtuosity and ingenuity, like instrumentalists Prince or D\u2019Angelo for example, who actually both never won Album of The Year, but perhaps the minds of the more old-school voters saw him as a true musician. He had an input on everything you hear on the record. A genuinely impressive feat, I must add. (Shouldn\u2019t Kanye West have at least two AoTY Awards given this?) But even putting that aside, Lamar, as a lyricist, is currently the best of all nominees and by a substantial margin. He excels supremely at his talents.  Lastly, I just want to say that in 2012, Lamar bursted into the mainstream with, what most publications would say is, one of the best albums of decade, a poetic, poignant, and cinematic conceptual record called good kid, m.A.A.d city. Nominated for Album of The Year, it lost to an excellent, but not as excellent, more successful record, Daft Punk\u2019s Random Accessed Memories. It\u2019s loss, when accounting for respective commercial performance, made sense. Then Lamar improved lyrically, artistically, and completely reinvented himself stylistically with To Pimp A Butterfly, maybe the most celebrated album since Radiohead\u2019s seminal OK Computer. He lost to Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989, a worldwide box office success, but in comparison, not anything particularly special, creatively or otherwise. It was strange to see sales mean nothing in the Rap Categories, where Lamar swept his contemporaries, but watch it seemingly mean everything for AoTY. I was stupefied, but he couldn\u2019t hold a candle 1989 earnings. There was at-least a hint of sagacity to their choice.  Then Lamar returns. This time with immense, in fact, the most successful record, wrapped in a familiar bow called lyrical talent, artistry, and (again) uncontested critical acclaim. But, he loses to 24K Magic? An album that was not nearly as acclaimed, nearly as imaginative, or even as successful? Every one of his songs debuted on the charts for goodness sakes and he couldn\u2019t Song OR Record of The Year? I\u2019m sorry but this makes zero sense. Meaning something else is the culprit. Is it an undisclosed mislike for Hip Hop? Fear of giving such a prestigious award to a revolutionary artist? Just a hint of social consciousness too much for the Grammy\u2019s? Is it fear? Of what? Only they know. Regardless, if you needed another reason to scoff and wince, you got it.  Damn. ",
