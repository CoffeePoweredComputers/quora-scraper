            "answer_text": "Depends on how you define \u201cDAW\u201d. If you search for a software to produce music in the way it is done since the 1960, Ardour is very good, almost perfect. Record playing musicians, compose music in MIDI and play it with plugins and/or external hardware synths, precisely edit, arrange and mix all that: Ardour has everything you need for that. In intuitive ways and still flexible enough even for very advanced needs. You may also controll most of its plethora of functions using professional hardware remote controls such as the higher tier Mackie mixers. And you can produce soundtracks in up to 16 output channels in the master with a videotrack synchronised. And it works natively in Linux, so you have every option imaginable to build a specialised music computer around it, thanks to the audio/midi server Jack you can also use a lot of Jack aware sound programs as if they where hardware. Such as GuitariX as a instrument amp or Yoshimi, CALF, Carla, AMS and many others as software instruments. Projects made in Linux can be used in the officially supported Versions of Ardour for Mac and Windows as well. And vice versa, given the used Plugins are available in all used platforms. Anyway: if you look for a software that is specialised in loops and patterns, Ardour would not be your best choice. You can work with these techniques in Ardour but the workflow is not exactly designed for that. Basically Ardour is a classical recording studio, not so much a tool for composition methods frequently used in electronic music. Try Tracktion Waveform or BitwigStudio in that case. If you really want to specialise on loopbased electronics, LMMS may be a good choice too. Short: if you plan to record something like Zeal and Ardor or a Joanna Newsom Album, get Ardour today, if you are more into competing Skrillex or producing beats for Rappers in a flexible way, better try Waveform, Bitwig or LMMS.

            "answer_text": "I have used a few DAWS - I still like Ardour for workflow - for some songs it is smooth fast and easy. Other topline DAWS have much more to offer (With Reaper Native Linux at the top of the heap IMO) but the more they offer it hinders workflow\u2026 so Ardour will always be good for this reason alone. I like the fact that Ardour is rock solid stable on linux and works as it should. ",
