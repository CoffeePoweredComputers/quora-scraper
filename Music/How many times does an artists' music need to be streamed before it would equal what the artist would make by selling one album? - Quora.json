            "answer_text": "So the problem is that sale of physical copies cannot directly be compared to streams. Let\u2019s see how close we can come by getting some numbers. Triple A artists would get a deal like 7% royalties, at 8c per album this translates to 56c. Selling 10 million copies of an album would pay out USD 5.6 million in royalties. (Well, not PAID OUT as such, as the recording costs, promo\u2019s marketing and \u201cbreakage fees\u201d would be deducted from this, as well as taxes - the artists in question would see about USD 1.1 million of this. Streaming songs has an average composition royalty rate per stream is around $0.0005, according to Audiam, in the case of on-demand streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music, there\u2019s an additional royalty generated on the composition called a streaming mechanical. The average streaming mechanical rate per stream is somewhere around $0.0067 resulting in a payment of 0.0072c per stream. The absolute biggest songs of the past 3 years stream upwards of 500 million times. Say 8 album tracks would stream 50 million times each for a AAA artist, giving us USD 2.88 million in royalties paid out. After tax that\u2019d be about USD 1.3 million. I guess it\u2019s a fair assumption that the record contracts have not changed that much, so there will still be money deducted for (part of) recording and such leaving the artists with way less than this. To make things simple, to get the target USD 5.6 million gross royalties from 10 million sold albums the tracks would need to be streamed 780 million times. ",
