            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s easy. You can play most Metallica songs on open strings with a standard guitar tuning. Try it. The ostinato for Nothing Else Matters is completely open string on a standard tuned guitar. All but two notes of the Enter Sandman riff are open string. Creeping Death, Sanitarium and a host of others can be played with little use of the left hand. E minor\u2019s chord and scale contain the most open strings on a standard-tuned guitar. EADGBE. E minor triad-chord is EGB. E minor scale is EF#GABCDE. This allows a guitarist to play the most amount of notes with the least amount of effort in depressing frets. Plus it\u2019s easier to do the palm-muted-open-E chug (that driving, chunky \u201cdjent\u201d sound that Metallica loves; as does its fanbase) when you\u2019re in the key of E; and E major is too happy for Metallica. Plus, E is the lowest note on a standard-tuned guitar. It took Ibanez to create the 7-string and Brian Welch to down-tune it seventeen whole-steps to add more heaviness and chunk. Up until that point E was the lowest, darkest, heaviest, chunkiest note you could get on a standard guitar. Enter Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield. Not guitar virtuosi by any stretch. But they write kickass, badass, awesome riffs. Some of the best metal riffs out there. E minor allows you to write kickass, badass, awesome riffs without being a guitar virtuoso. Pretty basic. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some possible reasons: The band are familiar with the key - less effort to learn new chords, progressions and solos.James Hetfield is comfortable singing in that key. As a singer myself, let me tell you that's absolutely vital.The key permits the use of open strings for a guitar using standard tuning. Useful if you are using power chords.(Slightly silly, Spinal Tap-esque reason). If you can play open strings, this can be done one handedly. This frees the fretting hand up to punch the air or do that devil horns thing.",
