            "answer_text": "I have to assume that you are multi tracking because that\u2019s what garage band does. The simple answer is press the solo button. If you have say, played guitar and sung at the same time then that\u2019s not possible. If that is the case I would suggest calling that your scratch track and open some new tracks to record the real ones. You will need to use headphones to keep each track isolated from the others. There are a million ways to do this but for fun I\u2019ll say: -record your guitar track -pan it to the left and record an identical one that you will pan to the right. -put a capo on in a spot that makes sense and record two more, also panned left and right. -because you left a spot for a solo now you can record that. Double it if you want. You may want to pan them closer to the center but no rules. -Turn the scratch track off. -record the vocal(vox). You may want to double it with one slightly quieter than the other. - if there are bg\u2019s(background vox) now is the time for that. add spice to taste. Now if if you hit the solo button on any of the tracks it will be by itself. ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t isolate vocals from mixed down tracks in GarageBand or in any other software. At most, you can use EQ to make vocals a little quieter (though this will also make everything else in that frequency range quieter.) Sometimes it is possible to remove or quiet vocals by taking advantage of differences between the left and right stereo channels, but this does not work on every recording. Ultimately, if you want isolated vocals, you need find the isolated vocal stem, and these are not always available. ",
