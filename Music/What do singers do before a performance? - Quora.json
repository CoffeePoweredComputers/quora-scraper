            "answer_text": "For me, it was mostly load and set up equipment. Since I was just in local/regional bands, we didn't have roadies. Sometimes the venue had a sound guy, sometimes they didn't. So several hours before the gig I was loading equipment into the truck or trailer (depending on if I was bringing a full PA). Then driving to the gig, usually singing along with whatever I was listening to. Then you get there and it's time to load in. Instruments and equipment out of the truck, on to the stage, in place, powered and cabled, and then stage tested. Fix whatever doesn't work: replace cables, re-duct-tape my harmonica mic, replace batteries, etc. Then it's time to mic the stage. 9 channels of drums, bass, 2 guitars, keys, sometimes 3 congas and 2 timbales, and 4 vocals. Mic check, level check, turn the guitars down, fix the mics on all the drums, get baseline monitor levels, turn the guitars down again, get a decent room sound, try to finalize the monitor mix, turn the guitars down again, actually finalize the monitor mix, good to go. The sound guy puts on some music and we all sit down and get food, drinks, whatever, and relax for an hour or two until the room fills up. Sing for 3\u20134 hours. Then it was time to do it all in reverse. On an average gig, worth $50-$100 per person, I would spend an average of 3 hours actually performing and more like 5\u20136 hours loading up, driving, setting up, tearing down, driving home, and loading the gear back into the house. That means live music is a $5\u2013$6 per hour job, if you don't count practice, gas, the food/drinks while at the gig, a hotel room if it's far and you don't want to drive 2 hours home at 3am, etc. Add in the cost of equipment and I really paid the bars to let me play all those years. That's what I did before, and after, a gig. ",

            "answer_text": "I love this question because you asked what singer do and not what should they do. Generally speaking they are 2 separate things. I was in stage and touring bands in the 70\u2019s up to the 90\u2019s and I generally did all the wrong things before we played. I never drank anything with milk because it causes mucus and depending on what type of music you sing that is not a good thing. Other than that I never really didn\u2019t do anything special because back in the day we were all wanting to be Rock Stars and we focused more on how we looked instead of performing any rituals before going on stage. At times we played 4\u20135 hours a night and up to 5 nights a week. There is one thing I did do though and it is important for any singer and that is warm my voice up. Even to this day if I am going to the studio to record I warm my voice up. I\u2019d sing before ever going on stage or recording and would sing something that didn\u2019t put too much strain on my voice. While performing I never drank alcohol and usually drank sprite or ice tea and also avoided things like orange juice or lemonade while performing. I loved being on stage so I never needed to get psyched before going on no matter how large the crowd was. It\u2019s different for everyone so I\u2019m sure you can ask 100 singers and get 100 different answers. ",
