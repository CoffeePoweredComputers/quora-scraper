            "answer_text": "All these answers ignore the realities of current American radio. Clear Channel owns most of them, and decides what to play. This has a direct correlation to the number of persons under 25 (maybe under FORTY) who don\u2019t ever listen to the radio, but to Spotify etc, or their own playlists on iTunes etc. Music companies PAY radio stations to play their artists. And yet, I\u2019ve heard BTS in my local GROCERY STORE 3 times in the past 4 months. You may think \u2018not so much\u2019 but I\u2019m only in there briefly, maybe 5 or 6 times a month tops, and the songs those stations play are in rotation, so hearing any song repeatedly means it\u2019s played a lot. KPop has become a genre in the US. MTV created a category for it (to prevent BTS from winning everything at the VMAs, of course, but still, it happened). Billboard reports on the latest KPop groups now, and it\u2019s next to Latin music as far as popularity. The radio stations are playing BTS and various collaborations with American artists now. ",

            "answer_text": "Why don't American radio stations play K-pop? Some do, it just isn't too frequent. I have heard BTS Idol and BTS Boy With LuvIdol Nikki (idk how to spell it) version and normal versionBwl i heard lots of different times, but once i got mad because the station cut out ALL the raps in the song.But they probably just do not play it because Kpop is foreign\u2026 it is overseas music, and kpop has just began becoming extremely popular internationally (though i know it was popular to a degree at different points of time with like SHINee and BigBang) so it is still a relatively new kind of thing. Thank you for the request :) - xoxo\u2022maleah ",
