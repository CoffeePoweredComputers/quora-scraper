I\u2019ve been dancing hip hop for a few years now and I'm guessing you don't have access to dance studios or rooms like that, so just start by learning a few Kpop dances that really interest you and after you've learnt and danced to it a couple of times record yourself and correct any mistakes and repeat the process. Even if it may seem hard, with every mistake you make and correct, you are learning something new and getting better at dancing. Start by easier girl group dances if you\u2019re really new and as you get better go for more intermediate dances. ",

Search up some Eminem and Nicki Minaj, too. For dancing, improve your flexibility and athletic attributes. Make sure your body is strong enough to be dancing for a long period of time. Search up some dance routines and choreography. ",
