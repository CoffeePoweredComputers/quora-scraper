            "answer_text": "I've actually never had this issue. Instagram takes videos up to one minute. Mine generally run thirty seconds to one minute in length after I've edited them specifically for Instagram and Twitter. Twitter's limit is thirty seconds. I would recommend going frame by frame and adding additional frames that don't detract from the continuity of your clip to the end of your video until you have the appropriate length. Afterward view it several times to be certain it flows the way you want so you achieve the impact you're looking for when you publish your video. ",
