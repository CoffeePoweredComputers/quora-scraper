            "answer_text": "Damn, I was going to answer with \u201cThe Prophet\u2019s Song\u201d or \u201c \u201939 \u201d but they seem to have already been covered. Alright then, I\u2019ll go with \u201cGood Company\u201d, yet another song of \u201cNight at the Opera\u201d. This song is, though played in a cheerful tone, quite sad as it details the life of a man who is never able to keep anyone faithful by his side and loses his friends along the way. This, in turn, causes him to shut himself out from the world and even leave his wife and end up spending his days alone. The song sounds fantastic, as the ukelele and the tapping drums make it feel as if you\u2019ve almost found yourself in a quite European bar, and you\u2019re just listening to the performer describe his woe\u2019s onstage. So aesthetically, it\u2019s a beautiful song. How about lyrically? Well for what it needs to be, it\u2019s really quite simple, and I mean that in the best way. It is straightforward and doesn\u2019t need to amaze with any clever wordplay or metaphors because it is just telling a small, basic story, which needs small, basic words. Mercury on this song is fantastic as always, channeling a very Paul McCartney like sound to his voice an using that to help accentuate the emotions of the song all the more. In total, it\u2019s a brilliant piece off an equally brilliant album, and definitely deserves more attention than it gets. But hey, if you\u2019re on the album with Bohemian Rhapsody, what real chance do you have. (P.S: If we\u2019re discussing songs off of \u201cNight at the Opera\u201d that are underappreciated, \u201cSeaside Rendevous\u201d. Although it is more of an interlude so what more can you do?) ",

            "answer_text": "I would add to the very good songs already suggested a title that wasn't released until 2014 called \"Let me in your heart again\". As a fan of Queen since the age of 10, I find it quite impressive how this song which was initially discarded by the band, conveys their sound and energy at its best. Basically, every Queen album has very good \"unknown\" songs. To cite some of their later work, the best \"unknown\" track on \"Made in Heaven\" is arguably the title track: on \"Innuendo\" it is quite possibly the title track, and on \"The Miracle\" it must be \"I Want It All\". But really, these albums have handfuls of gems totally worth listening and enjoying.  ",
