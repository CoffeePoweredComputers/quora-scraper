            "answer_text": "Well, you need two things. The first is that your car needs to be able to receive a Bluetooth signal (most modern cars do) If your car is NOT able to get Bluetooth you might have to add Bluetooth as an after market add on to your car. Expect it to cost anywhere up to the cost of a new radio/stereo for your car. Next you need something that can TRANSMIT Bluetooth, generally your phone. When you have your car stereo modified, make sure that you get a microphone mounted in your car for you to use on the phone. I have a 2001 Lexus RX300. It did not come with Bluetooth. I had it built in for about $800. Now IT\u2019s broken (grumble grumble) Now comes the easy part. Tell your car or after market device to be ready to connect. This will be different based on the configuration. Next go to the phone and tell it to connect. scroll around until you find the car install Bluetooth or original Bluetooth. Click on that in your phone. ",

            "answer_text": "From USB what? USB key? USB port on a laptop? Micro-USB port on your phone? Let\u2019s assume USB key. What type of car? What year? Make and model? My 2014 Ford Focus has a USB port under my center console for charging my phone. I also believe I can use it to bring up contacts on my phone to place Bluetooth calls. I have never used it to play music. I am not sure it can, but it might be able to. A quick lookup at Ford.com says my SYNC\u00ae in my car, which is what they call the user interface, can indeed play music off a USB key. The car I had in high school, 1972 Buick Skylark, had no USB ports anywhere. So, it would be totally out on that car. I am sure if your car is not properly equipped, you can buy after market products to add this functionality to any car. To see if your car supports it, please refer to its Owner\u2019s Manual. ",

            "answer_text": "If your car with a built-in USB port, you can plug it with your phone or other USB devices. Just insert your USB drive into your computer, drag and drop Music songs to the USB. And you can insert the USB to the USB port of your car stereo system, now you can start playing the Music songs from USB drive in your car at will. ",
