            "answer_text": "The honest truth is, that trained musicians have gone through a whole process of education through a graded music system which includes Aural, Sight Reading, scales and arpeggios in root position and inversions along with theory.  This knowledge is a cumulative acquisition undertaken over many years. There are certain people who view certain aspects of this training as redundant.  At school, I had a class music teacher who regarded learning scales and arpeggios as a waste of time, because you could learn them in the pieces. However, he was a decidedly mediocre musician who gave appropriately mediocre advice.  Playing scales and arpeggios, dominant 7ths etc. isn't  SOLELY technical training, it develops aural acuity, whereby you learn to hear how an inversion sounds different from a root, and how it connects within the tonal hierarchy. In the higher grades (here I am inevitably speaking from my personal experience of UK exams such as ABRSM), you have to learn to identify cadences and their approach chords  with inversions. This is just one aspect, while another involves listening out for the bass line in order to sing it.  The bass line is, in fact KEY to chordal recognition and what inversion may be involved at a given point.  If you have never gone through such a process of training, there will be gaps in your musical apparatus (if I'm making assumptions, please forgive me).  The question is, how to fill in those gaps (if gaps indeed they are). I suggest that you must find time, quite independent of your own personal transcription work, to embark upon a graded course of Aural Training.  Some of the early stages will seem needless to you, however, only by progressing through such a course will you learn what your gaps are, and what areas need particular attention.  Some may suggest, that you can do your own aural training.  To a certain extent, that may be true. However, what a COURSE in Aural Development will give you is a STRUCTURED approach.   I wish you well,  but you must do this kind of work if you are truly serious, is my view. ",

            "answer_text": "I like all of the excellent advice already here. I think that certainly it is true that the kind of aural skills you're inquiring after are part of a much bigger picture and are achieved through many years of training. The question being asked is not one that can be answered with a formula like, Oh, that's easy! You just listen for ______ and _______.   Learning to speak a language and to comprehend speech in that language is a serviceable analogy. How would you explain to someone how to go about doing that? You'd probably insist that they watch a lot of films in that language, spend a lot of time practicing conversation with fluent speakers, and maybe go live for a while in a country where the language is commonly spoken.  Where my feelings are a bit mixed is in the discussion of the type of training that works best to acquire versatile and finely-honed aural skills as a musician. I can agree with Mark about the benefits of a highly structured and graded approach, and in fact that is just the way in which I teach aural skills to others most of the time \u2014 but in my own personal experience as a growing musician, I never needed such an approach and was able to acquire a lot of fluency and skill without it.  In fact, I learned most of my aural skills without at all realizing that I was learning aural skills. I learned them by improvising at an instrument, by improvising with my voice, and by learning to play by ear, trying to recreate what I heard on the radio and on television \u2014 everything from Beethoven to Southern Gospel music and big band jazz. I did this simply through years of largely undirected and almost completely unstructured playing. Literally, playing, not \"trying to learn.\" I got quite a ways along in the journey before ever learning to read music, and before learning the first thing about the nomenclature and spelling of musical intervals, formal harmonic analysis, and so forth.  When I took a placement exam for a major American conservatory at age twelve, I could in no wise complete a simple harmonic analysis. This was not because I didn't understand the sounds or musical notation, as I very much did. It was because I didn't know the symbology and nomenclature. And yet I was able to absolutely blow the minds of the examining professors when it came time to take dictation. It took them a very long time to stump me; getting the best of me required some pretty severe atonal counterpoint, and then I was had.  It was only later that I learned the other stuff \u2014 and I'm very, very glad that I did. But by that time, about 95% of it was simply learning the names of beasts whose anatomy and habitats I had already grown to understand quite intuitively. By that time, I knew a great deal about the concepts, and in many cases had only to learn their names. I also like this approach; perhaps I am biased because that is how I grew up. What I like most about it is that it never once felt like a struggle to comprehend; it was always just a game which got progressively more challenging as I kept going. (It still does.) Perhaps for you, some combination of a highly structured curriculum in ear training plus a lot of time spent in musical perambulation may work best. The problem with learning this stuff as adults is that we become so goal-oriented, so task-minded, that we lose much of our inherent osmotic ability. I do think it's possible to reclaim a lot of that, but it takes a certain shift in perception and attitude. And it's a time-consuming endeavor with quite a long arc. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not sure I can answer this question - for one thing, after 50+ years of doing it, this sort of thing is now more reflex than methodology, and for the same reason (50+ years) current \"best practices\" may well be very different and far better than what I learned and practice. That said: My approach is, I think, two-tiered. The first tier is based on traditional harmonic theory, in which the harmony is expressed by the bass note and the intervals above it (bass continuo, in old-school terminology), while the second tier leverages standard jazz harmonic theory (in terms of progressions, substitute harmonies/reharmonizations, voice leading, and voice drops).  So I tend to focus on the bass line, determining on the fly whether it functions as a root, chord tone or passing tone, then analyze the intervals above it. Taken in the context of standard harmonic motion (dominant-to-tonic or -substitute-tonic cadence, for instance, cycle-of-fifths, and other predictable motions) it's pretty easy to sketch out the basics of a given harmony, even when there are occasional odd tensions (flatted or sharped 9ths, 11ths, 13ths, etc) to contend with. Listening carefully to the voice-leading of the inner voices in any progression can also be very helpful. Keep in mind that many chords functions can be interpreted differently based on context! It is often helpful, especially when using these progressions as the basis for one's selection of scales and other tools of improvisation, to \"interpret\" the chords in the way that makes the most structural sense and then explore the other possible interpretations... a lot of good ideas can be uncovered in this way.

Play the C chord in root position - block and broken. Play the  C chord in your left hand and play each note of the scale against it. Listen the blends and the clashes. Try singing the scale notes against the chord also.  Do the same for Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim. Pay attention to the number of each chord so you can transpose for other keys. Do the same with the chords in inversions. Explore how one chord after another sounds. Mix them up. Repeat above adding various 7ths, 6ths, 9ths, etc. Repeat all the above for A minor. ",
