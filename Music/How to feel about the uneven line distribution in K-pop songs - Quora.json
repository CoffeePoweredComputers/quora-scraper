            "answer_text": "Line distributions are a very controversial topic in K-Pop. They obviously matter. Idols do not train for five to eleven years with rigorous schedules that deprive them of physical and social stability, only to be pushed in the back of choreographies and given little to no time to actually sing or rap. The whole point of their careers is based on singing or rapping in songs, and line distributions are integral in providing them a stable career. But, instead of just discussing unfair line distributions, today I want to touch on the meritocracy system of line distributions.  One of the most famous examples of totally unfair line distributions within K-Pop is NCT, a group with twenty-one members split into four different subunits. Because of the pure number of idols within each subunit, it is insanely difficult to provide equally fair line distributions that suit the song and match the concept at the same time. For instance, this is the line distribution for NCT 127\u2019s \u201cCherry Bomb\u201d:  Johnny, most notably, sang only one line in the entire chorus: \u201cIf you are happy and you know it, clap your hands.\u201d People have compiled every single line Winwin has ever gotten, in both NCT 127 and WayV, and it barely even passed four minutes. [1] A lot of NCTzens were not even aware of what Yuta\u2019s voice sounded like until he sang a solo cover of TVXQ\u2019s \u201cWhite.\u201d   This doesn\u2019t even touch on the full extent at which members of other NCT subunits are constantly deprived of having lines. It\u2019s easy to see how every NCTzen has grown weary and defensive when it comes to line distributions. However, today, instead of just covering the clear unfair line distributions, I want to discuss exactly why this may be. A few weeks ago, SME released a video of NCT 127 working on the recording of \u201cKick It,\u201d featuring all of them performing certain lines in different manners, or singing different lines to try them out.  Similar to NCT\u2019s \u201cRecording Diary\u201d series, NCT 127 seems to be changing their lines up based on how well the producers think that they will fit the line itself. In fact, in the start of the video, Jaehyun states, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to record [the song] by expressing [\u201cKick It\u2019s\u201d] concept as much as possible.     Taeil is asked to perform different lines over and over again to either fit a \u201chip-hop\u201d or a \u201cmean\u201d style. Even Johnny tells Taeil to try out some other lines as well, commanding him to change its mannerisms up as best as he can in order to suit the purpose of the song. Haechan is told several times to either tone his singing down or tone it back up. We also see various members trying out parts that they were never given:    Several times over and over again, we hear from the members about how they personally feel about the song and the new arrangements and tones that they have to perform. Johnny and Mark both discuss listening to the demonstration song and the lines that were already written out. Jaehyun, in particular, is shown struggling to fit the tones that their producers ask them to cover.    Taeyong talks of not being able to \u201ccatch the right tone all the time,\u201d and Yuta is asked by the producers if he thinks that the parts he recorded are lacking. Taeil, after finishing the second round of recording, concludes that the tone of the song was difficult to match and that they had to rearrange parts of the song and lines of the members several times:    If it is already not clear by now, what we see NCT 127 doing is a meritocracy system of line distribution. Producers allow NCT 127 to try out different lines to see if they suit the tones of the song. Members either lose or keep lines depending on how well they are able to fit the song in the producers\u2019 eyes. Many groups follow this meritocracy system as well. For instance, Loona, another group with an unfortunately famous unfair line distribution, seems to follow the same formula, as Yeojin details:[2][3]     Evidently this meritocracy system is used very often in music industries, as per producers\u2019 confirmations. Does this necessarily implicate that those that continuously receive few and fewer lines are untalented? Not at all. These parts are given to members based on how well they can fit the style of the song, as NCT\u2019s \u201cRecording Diary\u201d series teaches us. And this is the dilemma of K-Pop producers. Do you give less lines to a couple of members that don\u2019t fit the particular mood of the song, or do you produce a song with less style and meaning in order to provide an equal line distribution? Oftentimes fans will yell about line distributions without realizing that perhaps there might be a reason as to why there exists such an uneven depth in lines. For instance, a commonly-cited group with poor line distribution is 2NE1.   It\u2019s more than obvious that CL is favored in terms of line distribution because she is the main rapper. People continuously use CL as an example of \u201covershadowing\u201d her group because of these line distributions. However, as a longtime YGE stan and an actual 2NE1 fan, I would like to point out something about this. Lines are given to specific members depending on what the song is supposed to sound like. Both \u201cFire\u201d and \u201cI Am The Best\u201d are meant to take strong inspiration from rap-heavy trap, hip-hop genres with a loud EDM beat. So what happens if we flip it and look at the ballad songs of 2NE1?   Both \u201cMissing You\u201d and \u201cIt Hurts\u201d are vocal-strong ballad songs, and the line distributions adapt to suit the singers of 2NE1 (Bom, Minzy, and Dara), instead of just CL. The line distributions, therefore, change depending on the style, tone, and meaning of the song. And the meritocracy system is once again at play, leveling certain members above others in order to fit the tone of the song. Of course, the meritocracy system doesn\u2019t explain why certain members in NCT and Loona constantly don\u2019t receive lines, no matter the tone of the song. It\u2019s clear from Yuta\u2019s cover that he is not the lacking singer that so many people claim he is. So perhaps it is legitimate favoritism or bias that causes Vivi to only get 2.3 seconds of \u201cSo What,\u201d a three-minute song. [4]  This is something I wanted to talk about for a long time, especially when it comes to 2NE1. I get really frustrated when people don\u2019t realize that 2NE1 is a group with many versatile songs, and the line distributions will change depending on the song. It\u2019s also quite bothersome when people claim that members who don\u2019t receive lines are just untalented, which just isn\u2019t true. It goes far beyond that.

            "answer_text": "Most people would say its so bad and stuff like that but I actually think that it is okay for several reasons. Songs have a concept to them- Groups are always going to try different styles each comeback. Every style may not fit every member or may fit one member really well. Of course the members who look, feel, and sound better will have more lines in a songThe company wants to push one member- this happens in a lot of groups. The company gives 1\u20132 members all the variety shows and magazines and stuff so that through one person, the whole group gets promoted. Like GD in BB and CL in 2NE1.Vocal ability of everyone is on a different level- companies sometimes have some trainees with crazy training gaps to other members of the same group. Sometimes there could be years upon years of gaps. The company wanted a visual or a dancer so they put someone with less training into the group.Members have positions for a reason- A group is going to have a Main vocalist and main rapper for a reason. Groups with 2 main vocalists and 1 main rapper will obviously have a line-distribution that is dominated by them. Its hard to keep switching every other line. Also, dancers of the group may get dance breaks which will make it hard to have to sing a lot live tooWhen a new person starts singing, positions change to highlight them and its hard on them to have to flip flop around a lot- I think this is a little self-explanatory. One person is highlighted during their part so if you want to be \u201cfair\u201d it would be hard for the idols to keep switching aroundIDK if it\u2019s just me but I feel like a lot of people who wanted to be actors became idols because their company wanted them to- If someone wanted to be an actor before, they obviously aren\u2019t super trained in vocals and are learning how to sing because they are a visual member in the group.However, I accept that in some cases uneven line distribution truly is bad and uneven. In iKON\u2019s Rhythm Ta, one member named Chanwoo was actually training to be an actor but was put into the idol part of YG and trained around 2\u20133.5 years less than all the other members so he ended up getting 0 lines(yes really, 0 lines just bg nanannananana). I love iKON(they are one of my ults lol) but when I found out I was like what? But in some cases its okay, it forms good songs and hits. Fantastic Baby by Big Bang is a song where GD has 44% of the song while Seungri gets 6.4%. Sure it is a little unfair but all members get a chance to sing and dance and be in the spotlight so its okay. For more I would suggest watching some videos on YouTube which explain this better than I can. ",
