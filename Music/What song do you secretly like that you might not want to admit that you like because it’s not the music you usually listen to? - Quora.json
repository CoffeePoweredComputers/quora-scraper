            "answer_text": "That\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t want to admit that I like the song. I often don\u2019t put songs on my main playlist because I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll come on when one of my friends is over. Sometimes I won\u2019t even admit to myself that I like a song because I\u2019m afraid of liking the song. Who knows? It might change my taste in music that I play on the guitar/ukulele/piano, and then I\u2019ll have to be even more careful than I already am choosing songs to play while around my parents or younger sisters. I wouldn\u2019t sing Dum Ting by Yomi in front of my parents, for example, because a line in the chorus says \u201cFuck det de mener.\u201d (I think it means \u201cFuck what they think,\u201d but I\u2019m not sure.) I also can\u2019t sing/rap in Norwegian super easily, or rap at all for that matter, so I wouldn\u2019t sing that song, but that is not the point. I read an answer written by Ethan James earlier today recommending Hopsin and decided to check him out. I would never admit to any of my friends that I like this person\u2019s music (what I\u2019ve heard of it so far, anyway) because 1) none of them listen to or appreciate rap music and 2) it isn\u2019t the kind of music I would listen to with or around my friends. I wish I could be more comfortable telling my friends about all the music I like so that I could open their minds to genres that they might not listen to normally, but alas: the only friends who would care only listen to music that you can play on the ukulele.

            "answer_text": "I listen to a variety of different artists, from Billie Eilish to AJR. One band that I don't tell anyone I listen to is Panic! At the Disco. My family is pretty strict when it comes to music, as I live in a Christian household. Heck, I'm not even sure that my parents would approve of a lot of AJR\u2019s lyrics (some swearing here and there). But I know that nobody in my family should know that I like P!ATD because first of all, they are judgemental. My sister has told me that she thinks P!ATD sucks (but she hasn't listened to them at all, so how does she know?!) and she's disgusted by them for some reason. Secondly, the lyrics. Some of the lyrics are a little.. questionable. Like the song every P!ATD fan knows, I Write Sins Not Tragedies. Specifically, this part: I chime in with a Haven't you people ever heard of Closing a god**** door I personally enjoy the song, but my family can't know because of those lyrics. Hopefully none of my family is on Quora. If you happen to be related to me and are reading this, all I can say is, \u201cSorry!\u201d ",
