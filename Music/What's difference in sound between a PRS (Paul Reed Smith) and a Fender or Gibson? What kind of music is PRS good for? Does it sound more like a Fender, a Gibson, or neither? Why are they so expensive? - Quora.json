            "answer_text": "This are actually a bunch of q's :) So ... First said, I am not a LP Lover, as - even though some great guitarists like Slash make them sing wonderfully - their muddy side is not my thing. Second I played a Les Paul copy (Aria Pro II) many years ago which was a neck through model and I loved it. I changed the bridge pickup to some Seymour Duncan hottie of that time (80s) and loved its warmth and endless sustain. But I never got warm with real LPs. I got stuck on Fenderish guitars, especially Music Mans, which are for me the better Fenders. They are more precise and lack that friendly and special sloppiness of Strats, which is why I love them but also will use a real hand chosen Strat in future. And I seriously decline you could not use them for harder music styles. It's just a question of your overall setup and pickups :) So to PRS: I actually one an SE, which might be far from the real thing, but I bought it because it is really awesome for the money and is somehow between the LP and Strat world. It is stronger in the mids, has good sustain but never ever muds everything down to a swamp of mud notes ;) the sounds Are quite versatile and again, it depends much on you amp/box setup. As I am lucky to own an Axe FX II I have them all. And it fits in many different settings. If you have a close look at the overall quality and details, you will see even the SEs do not look like 'oh that one is for the guys who can't afford the real thing'. Everything is handled with great care and the wood seems to be really good one, even for the SEs. I tried some at that shop and they were all great, so not so much difference in manufacturing quality. That is not my experience with Fenders and Gibsons. I would seriously try them out if possible, but not order one blindly. That's nothing which should be done with guitars. Especially you should buy a guitar which sounds inspiring to you :) Just spice of wood with the right name on it is not the thing you should go for ;) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve had 5 PRS guitars (Custom 24 SE, Custom 24, Hollowbody II Piezo, Custom 22 Piezo, and S2), 3 Gibsons (LP Std, 135, LP Traditional) and 5 Fenders (American Std Strat, American Pro Strat, Eric Johnson Strat, Custom Shop Jeff Beck and Telecaster Cabronita). I\u2019m not an accomplished player and don\u2019t gig, but have played each extensively and through a variety of amps from pure analog to solid-state and digital modelers. As most others will likely say, PRS has its own sound and vibe that mimics neither Gibson nor Fender entirely, though with most of the models outfitted with hum buckers, there is more tonal similarity to a Les Paul. While somewhat more known for metal sounds from the 90\u2019s, PRS are (IMO) amazingly flexible guitars that play an array of genres very well. I find the 25\u2033 scale length to be more ideal than 25.5 or 24.75 but this is highly subjective. As for their expense, the Core line is quite a premium, but for that you get a level of fit and finish throughout that is both higher quality and more consistent (from an individual guitar to another)than either in Fender or Gibson. Without a return window of least 14 days, I\u2019d hesitate to buy a Fender or Gibson online but would (and have) bought $3k+ PRS guitars sight unseen that never disapoint. Side-by-side, I\u2019d say PRS Core models likely equal Fender/Gibson Custom Shop, so from that perspective, prices are more equivalent. Not sure if others would agree, I\u2019ve only owned 1 Custom Shop Fender, but have seen and played many others including Gibson R8\u2019s and R9\u2019s. In particular, I\u2019d call out PRS necks for being exceptional, and adding to a very high level of playability and quality \u2018feel\u2019 that is hard to articulate but commonly observed in reviews and comments from players. Very high grade tuners and tremolo systems are also frequently highlighted. I think it\u2019s hard to fault PRS design, build quality, and tonal performance. If you prefer satin necks, there are fewer models from PRS that come this way so that\u2019s perhaps a consideration for the buyer. Additionally, the majority of the line has highly colorful, glossy finishes that are visually too loud for some tastes. If the Core line doesn\u2019t fit your budget, there is now a rather extensive line of SE models that deliver amazing quality at sub $1,000 prices. ",
