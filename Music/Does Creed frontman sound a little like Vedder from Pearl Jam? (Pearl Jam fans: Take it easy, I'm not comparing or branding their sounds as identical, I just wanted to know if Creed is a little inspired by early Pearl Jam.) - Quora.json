            "answer_text": "Yeah, Scott Stapp sounds similar to Eddie Vedder albeit less interesting. I figure however, that Creed\u2019s music and the production values of their albums are more along the lines of Load-era Metallica or something similar. Couple those with Scott Stapp\u2019s bombastic Bono-like persona and you have a perfect storm of late nineties middle american popular appeal and highbrow critical resentment. Interestingly enough, as Pearl Jam is essentially Temple of the Dog with Eddie Vedder replacing Chris Cornell as the lead singer. Alter Bridge is Creed with Myles Kennedy replacing Scott Stapp as the lead singer. Cornell and Kennedy too are somewhat similar vocalists but Alter Bridge and Temple of the Dog sound almost nothing alike. I\u2019m not a Creed fan but from what I\u2019ve heard Alter Bridge is actually pretty good. ",
