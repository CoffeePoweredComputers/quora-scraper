            "answer_text": "No he is not. Only gang members from N.W.A was Eazy-E and MC Ren. They were kelly park compton crips. Not even Ice cube had any gang affiliations. Dr.Dre acted like he was a gangster to sell records and most people like Suge Knight and Eazy -e questioned about subjects he rapped about in his Chronic album potraying a thug. Listen to Real compton city Gs by Eazy E. He only started to act like gangster when he was with Death Row records where Suge Kinght hired most L.A based gang members as security to protect his artists. ",

Though he grew up in a tough community in L.A., Dre was described as the shy kid who never really got into trouble. He didnt join any gangs or was ever involved in criminal activity which is why he has been reffered as a \u201cstudio gangsta\u201d. ",
