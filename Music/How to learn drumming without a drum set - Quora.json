            "answer_text": "You'll always have to start somewhere, with or without a drum kit. Personally, I did not own a kit when I started out. I think, almost only a year and a half after my first lesson that people actually started to think: \u201cRight. So he can actually play\u201d. Also the time I got my own kit. So, how did I keep learning in those 1.5 years? First thing I did was get myself a pair of sticks. Even if you don't own a kit, just get yourself a good pair of sticks. The 5B size is what would be optimum. Shouldn't cost you a lot. I used to take lessons starting out, so I would have access to the drums at least once a week (varied based on the frequency of lessons). Along the course of the week ,between lessons, I would practise anywhere I possibly could: on the sofa, on the bed, on my lap and what not. This is what got me by in those days. It may sound a bit ridiculous to some people, but this was how I practiced over that period of time. So, what I would suggest you to do is to improvise, find whatever you think is good enough to practise on and make it work. I was just in the 6th grade at that time, and people around me thought I was fooling around, banging sticks on mattresses (pcause what else would a normal 11 year old do anyway). If not a kit, even a practise pad was out of question. But the sole reason I kept on practicing during that time was because something about the instrument just moved me, as if I was in another realm just being on a kit. Drums are pretty expensive, compared to other instruments, and therefore I understand how this question would pop up. But, if you're really that interested I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get by. Of course, if your into it for the long haul, you'll need a kit. But just to get started, that can be done without one with just a little extra effort from our side. Hope this helps . ",

            "answer_text": "There are definitely ways to get started without a drum set, if the cost, noise or size of a drum set is going to make it difficult for you to get one. My earliest start with drumming was playing on pillows. Drum sets are expensive, and it\u2019s perfectly normal to improvise a drum set using other items for some time and still really enjoy it. There are now whole Youtube channels dedicated to practising without a drum set, so there are lots of options for someone just getting into drumming and seeing if this is a hobby they really want to get into. If you want some ideas about where you should go for free drum lessons you could do without a drum set, I wrote a more detailed article about it called \u2018Learn to play drums without a drum set\u2019 on my drumming blog. There is a great middle ground between pillows and a drum set, which is to get yourself a pair of sticks and a practice pad (The best one I\u2019ve ever had cost $60 but was well worth the money). A practice pad is a quiet way to replicate the feeling of a snare drum which helps you develop better technique and makes it easier to move onto a drum set at a later date. If the noise of a drum kit is the biggest factor stopping you from getting one, then you can always buy an electronic drum set. They are a world apart from an acoustic drum set in terms of how quiet they are. The only place you might not be able to play them is a flat (cause they still can cause vibrations that would go through the floor). I played on an electronic set for the first 5 years I was a drummer (after the pillows) and absolutely loved it. In conclusion, there are many different ways that you can experience the fun of drumming without having to break the bank. As you progress as a drummer and you get more and more into it, you\u2019ll probably expand the amount of equipment you have, but there\u2019s no need to be a perfectionist. Your enthusiasm is the most important starting point! ",
