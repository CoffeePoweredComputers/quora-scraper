            "answer_text": "It\u2019s no longer relevant because it became staid and dull and most of all, exclusionary.  In the beginning rock was a cultural explosion, an explosion that broke all barriers: between black and white, between the sexes, between high and low forms of art; it heralded a new age of unbridled hedonism and changed the world: it was Arthur \u201cBig Boy\u201d Crudup and Bill Monroe, Blues, country, folk and broadway show tunes. It was the Rocket 88 named Maybelline, bursting out of the gates and to the moon; the freedom of twentieth century travel and post-war spoiled children screaming their freedom; it was Alan Ginsburg\u2019s Howl and Jack Kerouac\u2019s ON the Road set the tune of screeching brakes and roaring engines.. It was whites and black sleeping together and making babies, it was all-inclusive.  In it\u2019s unbridled initial surge it kept unfolding, taking in elements of vocal jazz, English music hall, surfing, Beat poetry and Rimbaud, German expressionism and abstract impressionism: it was life and breath and the poetry of the moment, when the hot breath of the body you are dancing with is tickling the hairs of your cheek and all you really can say is \u201cShoo-bee-doo-wop and Shoo-bee-doo-way\u201d because nothing else mattered.  It\u2019s initial practitioners were pill-popping drug addicts and child molesters, who wouldn\u2019t think twice about sinking a knife into you, who burst through the barriers of your town, rocked your daughter\u2019s socks and panties off, blew out like a hurricane and changed the world, creating a technicolor landscape of denim-clad teens furiously humping.  YOu\u2019d have songs about holding hands, surfing; cute Italian or black chicks wearing beehives, singing about leather clad bikers that would beat your ass just for looking at them, all mixed together. It was the secret weapon that brought down communism as the grey world of Eastern Europe longed for the cool wild freedom that rock embodied. The problem is, by that time, unknown to the East Germans and Russians who longed for that freedom, that wild abandon, it had already been commodified by powers that it had initially railed against and who initially worked against it: because, after the initial shock wore off someone realized that the freedom that rock embodied was really good for business. It was part of the establishment: and every attempt to wrest it back from the establishment (the now 40 year-old punk thing) has been almost instantly co-opted \u2014 by the establishment. The wild uncool-cool of the pink-trousered Elvis Presley, pompadoured hair dyed black, make up running under the lights, sweating out fifteen pounds of drugged-up sweat a concert, fucking the TV screen while girls and boys wet their pants, \u2014 all that gave way to the measured, stiff upper lip, the hip sneer, the cooler-than-thou; the emotionless, staid stance of ultimate conformity that eased so easily into middle age. The intellectuallism of it all. Rock and roll became another way to sell Marlboro\u2019s and Michelob. It\u2019s practitioners became billionnaires who hob-nobbed with Presidents, preached a liberal message while hiding their millions in off-shore accounts. I mean, yeah, they are still criminals. But now they are white collar criminals, fully blessed by the Corporate State. Trash-free. Basted and crisped by tanning beds. Filled with Stove-top stuffing. And the music was\u2026not bad. Just conformist.  It started as soon as the record companies starting splitting Americans (and presumably others) into market segments: black, white, adult, child, college-educated, red-neck, gang-banger. Suddenly Rock and Roll music wasn\u2019t all inclusive at all: it was long hair and guitar; white skin; the expression of the piano, the original rock instrument was suspect and most un-penis-like. Still is. How can an artform be taken seriously when it has all these rules?  In the late seventies, as the genius urban (by which I mean, mainly, black) producers who melded rock, pop, James Brown funk, and orchestra and horn sections and sent it pulsating over the airwaves, white rockin\u2019 America put their collective foot down: NO MORE DISCO. It became a rallying cry everywhere as the pasty-faced, skinny tie set moved in with a vengeance to \u201csave rock.\u201d  The subtext wasn\u2019t exactly subtle: they didn\u2019t want to hear N\u2014\u2014\u2014- music. Rock, originally invented by Ike Turner\u2019s ode to speed and gasoline and incorporating music of all the folk sub-cultures in the USA \u2014 in all their dirty, ragged, off-kilter, red-necked splendor\u2014 and beyond the borders put up its barriers, put them up high and wrapped electrified barbed wire around them.. It was perfectly all right for a white English guy to do a song written by a black American about killing his wife, forty years after it had ceased to be culturally relevant; but a song about shaking your booty and pumping your loins? That was right out. Disgusting! What made it disgusting? The fact that a sweaty white guy with a beard wasn\u2019t playing it? You ever notice that the classic rock fans never mention Holland-Dozier-Holland, Goffin-King, Smokey Robinson or (hell), even George and Ira Gershwin with the same fawning, quasi-religious reverence that they hold for Lennon-McCartney, Jagger/Richards or Strummer/Jones? Ever notice that the only black music that is acceptable in rock circles to like is either a century old or re-commodified and sold back to Americans by British (or Irish or whatever)? Don\u2019t blame me: it is them who brought the identity politics into all this when they bought into the divisive barriers that corporate America had lain down for them. It\u2019s tragic. Really. Hip Irony, thy name is spinelessness.  Rock music isn\u2019t dead: but it\u2019s split into a dozen different markets and and market segments: and whether it\u2019s the violent rage of Death Metal, the sludgy sleaze of hard rock, the bright cleanliness of Mainstream Rock or the sexless nasal-pop of the shampoo\u2019d beard set you can bet one thing: it\u2019s white as white can be. It\u2019s no longer relevant because rock fans are essentially conservative. Read any rock forum, and you will find a million and one middle aged pontificators telling you why band x was no good, and why brand of music x is not artistically viable. And it is NEVER about what\u2019s on the record: it\u2019s ALWAYS about who played on the record. The simple fact is, most rock fans are just fucking anti-expression. Anti-single; anti-pop; anti-fun; and secretly anti-feministic and dirty\u2026.You get the picture. Even anti-melody, anti-beauty: some people will swear that if it\u2019s not sung by a man who sounds like he is shitting on the toilet, or whining off-key like a castrato, it\u2019s not real music. When the fans of an art-form start making all these rules; when cool is so easily and quickly commodified as \u201crock cool\u201d is, when it becomes a dog essentially chasing it\u2019s tail, it\u2019s not dead. It\u2019s just lame. I'm sure there are great impressionist painters in the world, too. So, Rock and Roll may never die. It is alive and well, thriving; even well-crafted: I like it. And in White Malesville, USA, and wherever middle-aged pot-bellies can take themselves seriously telling each other what they\u2019ve already read in the Holy Annals of Jann Wenner, David Marsh, Mark Lewisohn or what have you, it still reigns supreme. But it no longer has a good beat. And you can\u2019t dance to it. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIs there any chance rock music will make a comeback? What are some reasons it\u2019s no longer relevant\u201d? Rock music could certainly make a comeback. It\u2019s not as if it doesn\u2019t still have millions of fans. Within the last three years or so there have been a number of rock bands that have had worldwide tours that filled stadiums night after night. Fleetwood Mac, Guns n\u2019 Roses and Metallica are some of the bands that did that. That\u2019s relevancy! The question is; What new bands are coming along that will be able to do the same thing, or even do worldwide tours where they can fill arenas if not stadiums? Even when rock music was at its peak of popularity, most of the top bands toured arenas - not stadiums. Playing to 18,000 people a night is an incredibly impressive accomplishment by pretty much anyone\u2019s standards. The 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s were all filled with highly successful new rock bands who went on to do that. The teenagers of the 80s didn\u2019t stop listening to rock because it was \u201ca 1960s thing for old people.\u201d The teenagers of the 90s didn\u2019t stop listening to rock because their parents grew up listening to rock. What may be \u201cold\u201d to one generation of people is new and exciting to the next generation because they\u2019ve never head it before. It\u2019s an ever changing audience! Think of the first time you remember hearing rock music. It was new. It was exciting! There are children hearing rock music for the first time every single day. They haven\u2019t heard Led Zeppelin songs thousands of times. Or Fleetwood Mac songs. They haven\u2019t yet discovered bands like Queen or Aerosmith or Guns n\u2019 Roses. When they hear those bands for the first time, the music is every bit as new to them as it was to you when you heard it for the first time. The problem isn\u2019t relevancy; the problem is: How does a new band achieve that level of success these days? How does a rock band that\u2019s talented and has great songs go from playing clubs to playing bigger venues? That takes exposure. It takes radio play, although Metallica was the exception that got big without radio play. It takes someone who is going to be willing to finance your tour, because what new band has the money to undertake a major national or international tour? The major record labels did all of that for all of the great, legendary rock bands. They did that for The Rolling Stones, for Led Zeppelin, for Van Halen, for Guns n\u2019 Roses, for Pantera and all the rest of them too. Every legendary rock band you have ever heard of had success that was a product of the major record label system. It worked that well. Their record label contracts gave them publicists. A publicist\u2019s job is to push you! To get your name known! That\u2019s exposure. Radio play also gave new bands exposure. The radio industry is so different today, with the consolidation of a couple huge companies owning almost all the rock radio stations and with the advent of satellite radio stations that it\u2019s much more difficult to get the kind of exposure today from radio that new bands used to get. The record label would fund your tour so that you could afford to travel around the country or even internationally, with a good looking stage set and pay for the transportation and road crew necessary to put on a major tour. People talk about \u201cgoing viral on YouTube\u201das today\u2019s way of making it big. Well, is YouTube gonna fund your tour? Are they gonna give you an advance so you can afford to live? Are they going to provide you with a publicist who'll get you on magazine covers and get you interviews and market your new album? I don\u2019t think so! That\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of great success stories of rock bands that made it to the level where they can do a nationwide tour, playing in arenas every night, because of YouTube. Not that YouTube can\u2019t help a new band, but it\u2019s no replacement for having a contract with a major record label. Clearly, what is standing in the way of us having a vital rock music scene with great new bands is that nobody has figured out how to create a viable replacement for the major record label system. I\u2019d like like to think that either someone will figure out a way to do that, or that there will be some type of a resurgence of either the major record label system or a variation of it. That\u2019s what it would take to revitalize the rock music scene. It\u2019s not a matter of rock music not being relevant, or being something that\u2019s too old to interest young people. Young people still get interested in pro sports and look at how long the NFL has been around or the NBA or Major League Baseball. Kids don\u2019t say: \u201cThat\u2019s for old people, that\u2019s what my parents liked.\u201d These are simply forms of entertainment that have a timeless appeal. One is sports and one is a form of art, but at bottom, they are all part of the entertainment industry. When you attach the name \u201cpro\u201d to any sport and sell tickets for people to come to an arena or a stadium to see you play, you are in the entertainment business. The big difference is that pro athletes didn\u2019t suddenly find themselves in a situation where there were no teams left to play for or no leagues for their teams to play in. They didn\u2019t find themselves in a situation where all the sporting goods stores went out of business. Pretty much all the record stores were wiped out because of illegal downloading and file sharing; even Tower Records went out of business. The record labels and the record stores either went out of business or became a shell of what they used to be because people started just stealing their products instead of buying them. If something similar had happened to pro sports, some type of scenario where they couldn\u2019t sell their product anymore because people were just stealing it instead, they would be in the same situation now and you\u2019d hear people saying they\u2019ve become irrelevant and asking if they will ever be able to make a comeback. It\u2019s a situation where technology progressed in a way that became destructive for the music industry and especially for rock music, because it\u2019s more expensive to make than pop or hip-hop. What\u2019s left of the record labels system pushes those two genres hard right now because they\u2019re the cheapest ones to produce! Also, because by their nature, they\u2019re extremely mainstream genres and that makes it easier to market them and sell their music. Country still does well but it has changed a lot and become much more mainstream and commercial. It certainly doesn\u2019t sound like country music used to sound; it started to sound more like very light, very commercial rock music. Not all, but a lot of it did. Country music is also fortunate enough to have Nashville - a town that consistently supports country music artists, whether we\u2019re in a time where country music is considered \u201cin style\u2019 or not. Rock music doesn\u2019t have a Nashville. The closest thing to a Nashville rock music has got is Hollywood, but Hollywood isn\u2019t loyal to rock music the way that Nashville is to country. Hollywood will push whatever they decide they think will sell the most and cost the least money to make, and will drop everything else so they can push that one thing. That\u2019s what happened to AOR rock and metal when the grunge and alternative bands were the ones that the record companies decided to push. The pushed those things just because they decided it would be a good idea, but those turned out to not have as much longevity as classic rock and metal and basically turned out to be fads, like disco was a fad. Meanwhile, because they\u2019d stopped signing bands that weren\u2019t alternative or grunge, they did a lot of harm to their business. But that was nothing compared to the advent of file sharing and illegal downloading. They are what destroyed the major record label system. It needs to be fixed and so far it hasn\u2019t been. We either need that to happen or to have some other equally effective business model to be created and so far nobody has invented one. ",
