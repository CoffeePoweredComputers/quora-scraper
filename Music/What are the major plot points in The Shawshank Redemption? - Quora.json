            "answer_text": "I am not generally a fan of breaking down stories into plot points, I find it too reductive. In a good film, everything is a plot point. That said, the website scriptlab (http://thescriptlab.com/) does a good job of breaking down films in this way, for The Shawshank Redemption they have (spoilers ahead): \"1. INCITING INCIDENTA batch of new inmates arrives at Shawshank Prison, and the cons bet on who will break down crying first. Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman) puts his money on Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), but when the cons \"go fishin' with the first-timers\" that night and the chief guard Hadley savagely beats a \"fresh fish\" because of his crying, Andy doesn't make a sound, costing Red two packs of cigarettes. (00:17:46) 2. LOCK IN (End of Act One)While tarring a prison roof with Red and some other cons, Andy overhears Hadley complaining about paying taxes for an upcoming inheritance. Andy approaches Hadley, who threatens to throw Andy off the roof, as Andy informs Hadley how he could shelter the money from the IRS, offering to set it up for Hadley \"nearly free of charge\", asking only three beers apiece for each of his \"co-workers\". (00:33:41)3. FIRST CULMINATION (Midpoint)When a donation of old books and records arrive at the warden's office, Andy finds a copy of Mozart's \"Le Nozze de Figaro\", locks the guard assigned to the warden's office in the bathroom, and plays the record on the phonograph over the prison's PA system. Norton, the warden, arrives furious at the act of defiance. Hadley breaks into the office, and Andy is sent to solitary confinement for two weeks. (1:05:29) 4. MAIN CULMINATION (End of Act Two)With new information to prove his innocence, Andy asks Norton to help him get another trial, assuring Norton he won't reveal the money laundering schemes he set up for him, but Norton reacts by throwing Andy in solitary and luring Tommy, the only inmate who can testify on Andy's behalf, to meet him alone, where Norton has Hadley shoot him four times in the chest. (1:31:54) 5. THIRD ACT TWISTWhile Andy is not accounted for as usual from his cell, Norton finds Andy's shoes in a shoebox instead of his own and rushes to Andy's cell, demanding an explanation. With increasing hostility, he throws one of Andy's sculpted rocks at a poster of Raquel Welch, and the rock punches through and into the wall. Norton tears the poster away to find a tunnel just wide enough for a man to crawl through. (1:51:45).\" ",

            "answer_text": "\"Hope is always a good thing\". Andy faces the worst always in his life. He is imprisoned for a murder he never comitted in the first place. In prison he is constantly abused and tortured by a corrupt, sadistic jailor. Add to that  he becomes the victim of a prison rape. It would have been enough to break the spirit of any one. But not Andy, for all the pain he goes through, he ends up stronger than ever. Andy, never seems to give up hope, as can be seen by the way he keeps digging the tunnel, inch by inch, slowly, hoping to make his escape.  It is the hope of a better tomorrow, that makes Andy draw out all his inner strength, to fight the indignities heaped on him. \"Hope is dangerous\". In sharp contrast to Andy is Red, his friend and co inmate. Unlike Andy's introverted nature, Red is more outgoing, street smart, he knows how to bend the rules in the prison to his own advantage.  But within himself  Red is deeply insecure and cynical, he has never seen a world beyond the prison. Red is scared of actually facing the world outside,  he does not really want to be there. It is for this reason he warns Andy against being too hopeful.  Andy and Red are two contrasting personalities, but yet both have learnt how to survive in life. And that leads to a wonderful friendship, which both benefit from.  Red  acts as a guide to Andy in the prison, helps him to survive and get around in a harsh world. And Andy  returns the favor back to Red, when he comes out from prison, helping him to make a living in the real world. ",
