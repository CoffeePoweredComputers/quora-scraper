            "answer_text": "I believe there is an answer to this question, so I will give it a thorough attempt. First, it depends on what your priorities are.  There are several reasons to use a DAW.  Some people use them merely as a more interactive tape machine, others use them as a complete studio (like myself).  For some people cost is a major issue, for some money is not an object.  Some users value an immersive MIDI/plugin integration for composition (hip-hop/EDM producers, musicians), some prefer working with pieces of audio (recording, mix, & mastering engineers).  Some are happy just producing directly from their shop, others require easy compatibility with outside studios. I will list 3 top DAW products that I have significant experience using and explain how each one satisfies each category, from that, perhaps you can make a sensible decision as to which DAW is best for you.  I am not considering how easily your project will transition to a live environment, or live-performance features at all, this answer is written strictly from a studio-work perspective, however, some DAWs make strides to be more live-friendly so I will mention that where it applies. These products are not listed in order of superiority, but rather the order in which I thought of them.  I have attempted to summarize their rank with a 5-symbol ranking system in each category of concern as well as in total, which I've averaged from their rank in each category.  DAW's that cost more will have a lower cost ($) score, which is counter-intuitive, but makes the scoring system consistent and easily averaged. 1. ProTools  **** Obviously the industry standard and most popular in studios worldwide. ProTools started life as a robust editing interface designed to digitize audio and make it easily editable, while maintaining extremely high audio quality. This is one of the reasons ProTools (for years) required that you use their interface; they had put great attention into making converters that represented their product well, and they knew that there software would be judged on this issue.  For them, it was a package deal: great audio hardware, powerful software, great end result.  Virtually every major label album you've heard in the last 20 years was edited on or otherwise saw the inside of a ProTools setup.   Cost     *ProTools is not cheap.  Even though today you can use ProTools with a non-ProTools interface, the software itself, along with any decent plugin setup will cost you thousands of dollars.  This is money well spent, however, if you require top-notch quality, real-time plug-in monitoring while recording, and widespread studio compatibility, or you are producing an album for widespread release on a major or indie label. Compatibility     ***ProTools can be run on both PC and Mac, and almost any decent studio uses ProTools, so it does give you a distinct advantage there.  However, because versions vary, plug-in versions vary, 32 vs 64 bit matters, and other issues, the portability of a ProTools project is rarely what you hope or imagine.  The busier and more successful a studio is, the less likely it is that they will have taken the time and effort to disrupt their studios by keeping up with the latest version, latest plugins, or even 64-bit software architecture.  So, most of us are left printing our tracks to high-quality audio and loading it into a ProTools setup for tracking/mixing, especially if we have lots of tracks of MIDI feeding various plug-ins, etc, or a special effect we like that we can't easily reproduce in a competing plug-in or piece of gear.  I scored ProTools a little higher on compatibility than the others because ProTools' prevalence means that when someone sends you a simple project, say some vocal tracking, it will most often be in ProTools format, unless they exported audio, so having ProTools is a huge benefit here. Engineering Platform     *****Excellent, end of story.  ProTools has two distinct advantages here, among others.  First, ProTools has a set standard for hard drive performance that they publish, which audio-specific hard drive makers use to make drives that will have maximum compatibility with the software.  This ensures no stutter/lag/latency when recording, punching in, or playing back large projects.  Second, ProTools uses the RTAS plugin platform, which stands for Real Time AudioSuite.  These plugins are specifically designed to work in real time in a studio environment without latency or punch-in lag.  This is extremely important to simulating a real, analog, real-time recording setup, which is what your DAW should strive to do.  A great example is recording with the Antares Auto-Tune plugin in real time, so you can \"sing to it\" and hear the end result in your headphones as you sing, which is a huge plus for being highly expressive with this very popular effect.  It is the closest thing to using a hardware Antares unit that I've ever experienced. Midi Integration/Composition      ***ProTools used to be way behind in this category, which is way Nuendo/Cubase, Logic, Digital Performer, and other competing DAWs were able to take sizable market share from DigiDesign in the late 90's/early 2000's.  They aren't dummies though, and they have made major strides in catching up.  Today's versions of ProTools (8-10) have pretty strong MIDI integration and editing, with a standard suite of MIDI features and plugins.  However users who favor other DAWs often do so because they still find the ProTools UI/UX to be a little clunky and immature in this regard.  Count me in this camp. 1. Logic Pro   ***** Probably the second most popular DAW in production/studio environments. Logic started life as really good electric piano (Rhodes) plugin, matured into a small DAW around that, and then really exploded into a fully functioning composition DAW once Apple purchased it.   Logic will work with any USB or FireWire interface, or even the built-in Mac hardware; but because of that, the quality of your audio is at the mercy of your hardware.  That said, get a great interface (Apogee or UA) and you will be easily rivaling ProTools' quality and responsiveness.  Many great albums and popular tracks that are released on major or indie labels are made in Logic, mine included :).   Cost     *****Logic is very affordable.  Although a nice Mac tower to run it on is not cheap, (3-4k for a decent setup) it will also run very well on a robust iMac or MacBook (1.5-3k).  The real benefit here is that the software itself is only $200, and can be purchased right in the Mac App store.  Plugins tend to be widely available, and the software comes with a very high-quality assortment of both virtual instruments and effects plug-ins, saving you thousands right out the gate.  The Rhodes piano, B organ, and Clavinet are all extremely life-like and are regularly used by professionalsfor recording/composition, and through MainStage, even live performance. Compatibility     **Like ProTools, a Logic Pro project will rarely be entirely portable, so you are left printing tracks to take your work to another studio or for mixing. However, the compatibility between versions has largely been excellent, and the Apple AU (Audio Unit) plug-in platform has proved very popular, so many manufactures of the highest quality plugins (UA, Waves, etc) all make AU versions.  In many of these plugins, a plugin configuration saved in one platform (like RTAS or VST) will be compatible when loaded into the AU version, so my favorite SSL plugin settings were easily loaded in the AU version of the plugin after being saved from the VST version.  This does require that you use the plugin's preset save feature, so that the preset is saved in the plugin's native file format, not the file format of the DAW you were working in.   Engineering Platform     ***Very good, but not ProTools.  Logic Pro has some significant deficiencies here, but nothing that can't be worked around with high-quality hardware and good disk I/O.  It just isn't as easy as an off-the-shelf ProTools setup to get the performance you desire.  Getting lag-free punch-in is counter intuitive and difficult for a new Logic user, and real-time audio monitoring is not great.  However, these issues are not deal-breakers in a project studio environment, most of us can handle a brief delay in playback as recording starts, or the occasional glitch in playback while monitoring when we are working by ourselves.  I found these to be minor annoyances, not show-stoppers, and with a little training, the settings can be tweaked to avoid them altogether.  Editing and mixing are both vary intuitive in Logic IMO, however, the keyboard shortcut setup is a little wonky at first.  Getting a keyboard cover with all the shortcuts printed on the keys is highly recommended. Midi Integration/Composition      *****Absolute amazing, no question.  The best built-in instruments and effects, very intuitive MIDI/score editing (easy to make notation or tablature from a MIDI chunk, etc.) and incredible hands-on musicality make Logic the clear winner here in my opinion.  Logic has wonderful automation, time-stretching, and pitch tools built right in, and in my opinion, they far exceed what ProTools can accomplish in this regard without additional expensive plugins.  If you make beats, remixes, or need to pitch/time correct a capellas to a new track, Logic is hands-down the best for this purpose.  Tasks like time-matching a vocal to a new track that is a few BPM slower or faster, or making a vocal swing when it used to be straight, used to take me hours in Nuendo/Cubase, Samplitude, or ProTools, but takes literally minutes in Logic. I am an avid remixer/re-producer, so this is a very helpful plus. Bonus - Mainstage - *****Mainstage is an Apple product that is designed for live performance.  It is incredibly powerful and can really help you take the exact sounds/plugins you use in your Logic Projects to the stage.  ProTools has nothing like this, and it is a HUGE boon to the project producer that intends to perform their projects live.  I highly recommend it. 1. Nuendo/Cubase   *** The Cubase family of apps started life as ProTools main competitor on the PC side of things.  For me, since I start producing in 1997 on a PC, Cubase SX 2.0 was, at the time, the only game in town with the feature set that it boasted.  I was stretching audio in real-time, sequencing/automating MIDI and audio, and even getting impressive mix/mastering results with it back when most old dogs in the industry said it simply couldn't be done on a PC. Cost     **The Steinberg family of audio software runs right between Logic and ProTools in terms of cost.  The more full-featured package you get, the more you will spend, but Cubase 8 can be had for around $300.  A top-flight Nuendo version will cost more like $800-1000. It comes with some neat plugins out of the box, including the excellent Magneto tape distortion simulator, something that gave me great vocal and mastering warmth/fatness practically for free.  However, it does not come with anywhere near the suite of instruments and effects that Logic does, so you will spend quite a bit outfitting these things with third-party plugins. Compatibility     *I never found Cubase/Nuendo to be convenient in this regard.  Almost no one that I worked with used it, and often times version upgrades were not backwards compatible, sending me scrambling for new plugins that would replace old ones that no longer loaded.  Other times a newer version of Cubase would flat-out say that my project was made in an older version and could not be opened, because I had used some edge feature that had been removed.  That said, the VST plugin platform was once rich and varied and was really leading the league on PC, it also is more open and had a great community of hackers/developers making cool plugins for free.  If you are a PC user who can't/won't purchase ProTools (for myriad reasons), this is most likely still the case, you will get many plugins available in RTAS format for VST format, like UAs or Waves' excellent suites. Engineering Platform     ****Also very good, but also not ProTools.  Cubase/Nuendo does beat Logic here, however, because it is very intuitive and mostly lag/latency free right out of the box.  It isn't *quite* as excellent as ProTools in this regard, but a close second.  Punch-in is seamless/zero-latency all the time, even with a very large/memory intensive project, and the integration with off-board apps like Reason or Ableton Live through Rewire is intuitive and usually \"just works.\"  Of course, because these apps are open to be used with any hardware, like Logic, you will need to invest in great hardware and a strong/fast PC to get the most out of it. Midi Integration/Composition      ***Better than ProTools IMO, but nowhere near Logic.  However, this app does seem to prioritize composition/musicality more than ProTools.  As well, Nuendo includes many strong features for scoring to video/film, and the app has a strong legacy in using MIDI to generate actual music notation.  I've also found that it makes more sensible decisions about how to score your MIDI (i.e., it picks more efficient ways to express the same thing in notation, whereas logic tends to give you somewhat, er, illogical combinations of tied and dotted notes).  It probably even has tablature support by now, something that Logic does very well. The Bottom Line ProTools - **** (four stars). Largely because of cost and a somewhat still-archaic interface for editing/composing via MIDI.  Also, the lack of high-quality instruments/effects included for the high purchase price.  However, if you are a studio pro, or looking to become one, you absolutely must learn ProTools.  Also, if you require top-flight recording in real-time, ProTools is still the only game in town. Logic Pro/Mainstage - ***** (five stars).  Logic wins for me because most DAW users these days are project studio composers/producers who need a fully integrated music-making environment, and Logic is very musical. It will save you thousands in plugins with it's incredible suite of included instruments and effects, and it's remix tools are simply the best out, period. Lastly, a huge number of musical engineer/producer types use it, so you will find a robust community of friends and forums to learn from and work with.  If you need an excellent, affordable DAW to start bringing your music to life in your project environment with little technical struggle, just get a Mac and install Logic immediately. Cubase/Nuendo - *** (three stars).  Not as amazing as the others for any reason, but if you are a PC user who isn't planning on investing in ProTools, this is still your best bet for a combination of great engineering, good plugin platform, and great composition/automation features. AfterwordThis post does not consider a wide variety of other excellent DAWs and DAW-like products, including Samplitude, Digital Performer, Ableton Live, and Reason, among others.  There are also new excellent apps coming online all the time that are either more affordable/less proprietary or altogether open-source.  Lastly, this answer is somewhat biased toward the project-studio musician/producer, because that is the largest category of DAW consumer in the marketplace.  Thanks for reading, and I welcome your polite comments. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, right now, unless you're an Apple user (and if so, why?) I can't see why anybody wouldn't run, not walk, to download the FREE DAW, Cakewalk's Sonar now owned by Bandcamp. I've been a Cakewalk user for decades and the most recent version available now for free I paid over $500 for less than 18 months ago. It competed with Cubase, Ableton Live, Digital Performer, Studio One, Pro Tools, Logic, Mixcraft, Bitwig, FL Studio, Reason and others and, by the reckoning of most professionals in the industry was really in league with Cubase, Pro Tools, and Logic in terms of serious producer DAW products. It's as deep as they come and every feature you can imagine in a beautiful user interface, records audio perfectly and sequences MIDI (both hardware and vst / vsti) with ease. Has a powerful rendering engine that reduces latency and drop outs better than anything out there today, can accommodate any kind of interface or hardware controller, and supports touchscreen, Bluetooth, and even the Microsoft Surface Wheel better than any DAW on the market. It's unbelievably customizable, yet is very user and beginner - friendly. Further, it's been around for decades, so the bugs have been ironed out far more than with the younger DAWs. Add to this a passionate and HUGE user base with over 30 years of content on the Cakewalk Forums discussion board and tons of content, macros, and user-created accessories for the DAW, and you've got a winner that I (and tens of thousands of others) gladly paid over $500 for as recently as 8 months ago. \u2026but it's now all completely free AND BEING ACTIVELY DEVELOPED AND UPDATED. Unless you're married to another DAW already (and I mean married) I can't see why you wouldn't pick this free DAW. If ever there was a disruptive moment in music production technology, now is it. I'm not paid by Cakewalk (actually got royally screwed over by Gibson-the previous owners) and have no reason to make it sound better than it really is\u2026other than: it really is this good and there really are no catches and no strings attached. It's a free lunch if ever there was one\u2026and a FEAST at that! ",
