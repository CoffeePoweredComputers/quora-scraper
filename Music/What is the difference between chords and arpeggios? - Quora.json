            "answer_text": "Chord: several notes played simultaneously (at the same time). Note: it must not be a tonal chord (such as F major or whatever). Can be tonal, must not be. Arpeggio: several notes played one after the other one, usually quite fast and usually in ascending order. You find also descending arpeggios. If the notes are played one after the other but NOT in (either ascending or descending) order, this is NOT an arpeggio (but, for instance, an group of acciacaturas). So the main difference is that in a chord, the notes are played at the same time and in an arpeggio maybe the same notes are played one after the other, fast, ascending or descending. If you are playing lots of arpeggios and ONE chord is not to be played arpeggiato, you sometimes listen the denomination \u201cplaqu\u00e9\u201d as the opposite to arpeggio. According to this definition, you can consider the glissando as an extreme case of arpeggio: if a cluster is an extreme kind of chord, that cluster performed as arpeggio gives a glissando. However, for our perception both entities (glissando and arpeggio) are so different perceptually, that they (reasonably) receive different names. Juan Maria Solare ",

            "answer_text": "Chords are a group of notes played all at once. Take the notes C, E and G, hit them at the same time and you hear a C major chord. Now play each note separately. Play C, then stop playing that, and play E. Stop that and play G. This is a C major arpeggio. A variation is a broken chord, where you play an arpeggio, but let the notes sustain, building up to a chord. Arpeggios are real building blocks for lead playing. Being made of chords at heart, you can use them as a guide for your most important single notes at a basic level. You can go on to substitute arpeggios and get a hold get variety of melody out of them. ",
