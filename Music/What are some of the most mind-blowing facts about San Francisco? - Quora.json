            "answer_text": "Well, now you've put the quarter in me. San Francisco is potentially the very best place on earth \u2013 if you're willing and able to afford it. The City is walkable. Whether I'm heading to work, hitting the gym, or meeting friends for a meal, I'm almost always walking. This feels great \u2013 there are no insurmountable traffic jams when you're on foot. The exercise, especially going up and down hills, means I shed a good bit of weight within a few months of moving in. It's liberating to have so much of what I want within walking distance. The City of San Francisco is also beautiful. Crest a hill and you'll often get a view all the way out and across the bay. A gorgeous blue sky framing Alcatraz island turns into just another thing you see sometimes. There's a decent amount of trees. We've got lovely parks, both large and tiny. Save for the Financial District, the buildings aren't tall or oppressive. You get a city life without feeling cut off entirely from nature. And the food. The fucking food. There's a lot to eat here. A wide variety of ethnic foods and no shortage of perfectly-honed domestic fare. Rich competition drives up quality while lowering prices. You can definitely spend as much as you want on grub in the City \u2013 there's no shortage of fancy \u2013 but it's really surprising how much you can get for very little money. I also have to say \u2013 the people are pretty damn good. Lots of kind folks across all walks of life. Courtesy is the default assumption, as even drivers are indulgent of the most blatant jaywalker. (Cyclists are less friendly, but they have more stress to manage.) For nerds, the City is a boon for all of the experimental businesses who use it as a testing ground. Services like Uber, Exec, Instacart, Postmates and plenty others made San Franciscans their first customers. The innovation and convenience continually added through these efforts is pretty fun \u2013 and often addicting. Some negatives. The City does have a substantial homeless population. As any city, there are certain regions I'd rather not visit on foot. If you own a car, San Francisco hates you. Road closures, detours, expensive parking, impossible-to-find parking, parking tickets, yadda, yadda, yadda. My solution was to ditch the car. Very happy about that. There's also a gender imbalance favoring men, which may complicate finding romance to an extent that I'm not really sure how to measure. But overall, I'm challenged to think of a place I'd rather live. I've spent my whole life in various places, wishing I lived somewhere else. San Francisco is strange for me \u2013 the yearning go live elsewhere has, at last, been silenced. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve actually lived in San Francisco twice. Once in 2004\u20132009, and then again in 2016 until recently. All I can say is a lot has changed. Being young and stupid, it was a beautiful city with a lot of things to do. I thought it was a big city with a diverse group of people and good food. I get a little thrown off by all the people who say the weather is terrible. It\u2019s not. My friends who all say \u201cit\u2019s horrible\u201d come from Mexico City, SoCal, and Colorado, where yes, the weather is better. If you\u2019re from a place that has much worse weather, it\u2019s pretty nice. It\u2019s not \u201cFREEZING\u201d\u2026It will never snow here. It doesn\u2019t rain very much. It\u2019s also sunnier (or less foggy) by the marina district. It was weird to drive from marina into the inner sunset and learn that it was always foggy there. Walking around the city is fun and there are so many beautiful parts about it. Just looking at all the water is cool. I love how it\u2019s a great setting for so many movies. Transportation is expensive, except for the bus, where you\u2019ll want to take a shower or two right after. Of course, it\u2019s a city. The Uber and Lyft drivers are crazy and clog the streets, but you\u2019ll also be able to click the app button and have a car waiting 3 seconds after. I had my own car and parked in a private garage, but if you can\u2019t afford a garage, be prepared to be searching for a parking spot for the rest of time on the street. Also, expect your car to be hit, broken into, and messed with on a regular basis. One of the weirdest things you\u2019ll see on car windows are all the signs people write going \u201cthere is NOTHING in my car. It\u2019s been broken into 5 times, so please robber, don\u2019t break into it.\u201d Ya\u2026that will stop the meth heads looking for a quick score. I never once rode the cable car. I don\u2019t know, didn\u2019t seem like I needed to try it. Even having my car, I still walked 5\u20138miles daily because I loved it so much. Okay, so for some of the more not so great stuff. When I came back to work in SF again in 2016, it really did not have the same appeal. It was a hell of a lot more unsafe and the homeless situation was out of control. There are homeless everywhere, regardless of how nice of a neighborhood you live in. You\u2019ll see trash and people sleeping on a lot of blocks, and from time to time, human shit. The problem is out of control. There are times now when people just don\u2019t go outside. It becomes quiet around 10pm and if you go out early at 5am, you\u2019ll see Uber drivers sleeping in their cars, people injecting substances outside your place, and people searching all the cars. I love the screaming people in the middle of the streets who are coming down from their last high the most. It\u2019s definitely not pleasant. If you are not in tech and don\u2019t like that culture, you\u2019ll become a little annoyed. Walking into the restaurants and hearing conversations, you\u2019ll most likely hear a lot of kind of \u201ctype A\u201d nerdy people talking in code about something they are working on or how much work they have. It\u2019s fine, but it gets to be really boring. I don\u2019t know why but the \u201cStart up\u201d culture bugs me. More than 90% of these things fail as I know, because I\u2019ve worked in finance, but tech and money is crazy right now, and I predict another tech crash in the near future. It just doesn\u2019t pencil out. The only companies I see really moving forward is Apple and Google. Even friends at Facebook are worried and know they are hated. I tend to think a lot of people in the city are over worked, so they all look drained, bored, stressed, or not happy. With a city that is always going to the next level of cost, I understand why they are stressed. This is definitely a city of have and have nots. You have a group that is very affluent who own multi-million places and shop and dine out. Then, you have the regular side that struggles to afford their rent and can\u2019t even afford a car. Don\u2019t be fooled by all the people loitering, SF is one of the richest places in the country. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s so skewed in it\u2019s wealth distribution, that you\u2019ll either feel really lucky or pissed off. San Francisco is seeing an exodus of young and old people combined who are fed up with the costs and bad stuff of the city right now. I always read the SF subreddit on Reddit and people are moving out. The city even has felt emptier this past year, and not in a good way, because more of the homeless seem to be \u201cmoving in\u201d. I feel bad for the younger group who want to explore a once great city and for the older group who has to suffer from the young, affluent techies who made their money from a few well known companies. It\u2019s just not as fun as it used to be and I feel very lucky to have lived in SF when I was 23\u201328 because it was a beautiful place. It\u2019s still kinda cool, but it\u2019s definitely lost its elegance. I recently had my hair cut at one of favorite spots and my barber, who is in his 60\u2019s and has lived in the city all his life, said he thinks San Francisco will be \u201cunlivable in 10 years.\u201d What he means by that is that he thinks San Francisco will become a place where it will be too unsafe to walk or you\u2019ll be mugged, and it will have a bunch of super rich mansion bunkers where people will live in protection. Kind of like Elysium. Maybe it will, maybe it won\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t want to find out. I\u2019m finally lucky enough to afford a nice place and I\u2019m buying in Marin. Yep, getting out. I was looking in the marina and pac heights, but for $1.4 million, I can do more with my money. My sister owned a nice house in the marina district and she left because of the school system for her kids. I\u2019m just leaving because it\u2019s not as safe as you\u2019d want it to be. And whoever said, SF is a bike friendly city, you must be crazy. I wouldn\u2019t risk being hit by a Lyft driver. It\u2019s too hectic. But there\u2019s good things and bad things about every city. Maybe it will become nice again eventually, but I doubt it. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite its problems, I can't imagine living anywhere else. THE GOOD:First of all, the weather is perfect for me. I love going outdoors and hiking or biking, but hate hot weather and there's not much of it in S.F. There are hundreds of biking and hiking trails in the Bay Area, many in the City itself. Also, it's possible to get almost anywhere in the City on a network of bike paths. San Francisco is a great city to walk in. Sometimes, I will walk home from downtown (45 minutes) and take a different route just to see what new shops have popped up. The food in the City is amazing, also. The key is to find neighborhood holes in the wall. For example, I live in Crocker Amazon and there's a fantastic Salvadoran restaurant with a bunch of old ladies cooking authentic Salvadoran food and dinner for two is only about $15. Despite its reputation as being expensive, San Francisco always has plenty of things going on that are free or almost free. Street fairs, parades, Sunday Streets (where large chunks of streets are closed to cars), etc. Despite what you read about the \"techie invasion\", there are still plenty of \"real\" neighborhoods left where people know one another, there are mom and pop stores, and the vibe is casual. In my neighborhood, there's a drugstore (Daniels) that knows me by name and are extremely helpful. There's also a hardware store which, though it's a little pricier than Home Depot, is worth every penny because the guy who owns the place knows what's needed to fix almost anything. San Francisco also has an amazing number of parks, many of which are underused, such as Sutro Heights and McLaren. There are amazing views almost anywhere you walk. The City has a LOT of neighborhoods, each with their own distinct character. You read a lot about how techies are \"destroying\" S.F. but this isn't the case IMO. Some neighborhoods have gentrified a lot, but having lived here 30 years I've seen many neighborhoods that have changed more than once and they'll probably change again. That's just how cities work. San Francisco is one of the most dog-friendly cities I've ever seen. There are A LOT of dog parks and a lot of services for pet owners. THE MIXED: City services are a mixed bag. I've had to call both the police and the fire department before, and both responded promptly. However, I've also had to deal with the Planning Department and its byzantine regulations and the DMV in San Francisco is especially terrible (I realize that's run by the State). San Francisco is very integrated by race, but very segregated by class, and this is getting worse.  THE BAD: Since moving to District elections, the Board of Supervisors has become much more ineffective in getting anything done. They spend huge chunks of their time on things that don't really affect local citizenry all that much (such as international politics) vs. doing the things necessary to keep a city running--fixing potholes, replacing infrastructure, etc. Theater in San Francisco is nowhere near the quality you get in New York, London or even Los Angeles.  I've never seen a City with more homelessness despite the huge amount of money spent to supposedly prevent it. If you walk around downtown, you have to wear headphones otherwise you'll be asked for spare change at least five times per block. City government nickel and dimes you for everything, tacking on all kinds of fees for just about anything you want to do. There is no easy way to go from North to South in the City by bus or by car. East to West is fairly easy with both Lincoln Ave. and Fulton Street, but trying to go North/South on Van Ness or any of the other streets requires a lot of patience and it's faster to bike or sometimes even walk. There is a lot of NIMBY-ism in S.F. and an entitlement mentality among a large segment of the population. No matter whether someone wants to build a building, open a store, start a service, etc. SOMEONE will complain about it. The entitlement mentality becomes most visible when it comes to transportation. Cars routinely ignore traffic rules and cut people off, but so do bikes. Pedestrians step onto the street looking at their phone screens without even bothering to check if it's safe to cross. Large chunks of the population think nothing about closing a Laundromat to put in a fancy new eatery even though poor people still really need the Laundromat. Parts of S.F., especially SOMA, are starting to resemble a \"Disney-fied\" version of San Francisco. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve lived in SF since 1972, at which time my wife and I had the unbelievable good sense (and luck) to buy a house here. We moved \u201cup the hill\u201d in 1985 and are still there, with two kids \u201cborn and raised\u201d. Needless to say, we\u2019ve seen a lot of changes over the years, many good, but not all for the best. Many of the other comments here convey my own feelings for why we stayed in SF instead of moving down the Peninsula or over to the East Bay. But I would add a few more: 1) the cultural scene is outstanding. We have world-class ballet, symphony, and opera companies. There\u2019s a huge amount of local theater, in addition to the touring Broadway shows, which always seem to make SF their first or second stop. The SF Museum of Modern Art has just reopened, and has one of the best collections in the world. Unfortunately, the high cost of living here has put a serious strain on artists and performing companies, and I hope that they can continue to exist here. 2) the restaurant scene is dominated by local places, rather than by chains. Sadly, we have an Olive Garden (out in the far southwestern corner of the city), but fortunately no PF Chang or Chick-fil-a. If you look hard, there\u2019s an Applebee\u2019s at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, a Denny\u2019s downtown, and numerous Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, Subways, KFC, and Taco Bell here and there. But they are the exception, and there are about 4000 local places. Someone once figured out that everyone who lives here could go out to dinner at the same time and there would still be available space. Not all of the 4000 are great, by any stretch, but any place that survives for a couple of years outside the tourist areas is likely to be OK (or better). We finally have a few places that can make a good NY-style pizza, but SF is a tough place to go searching for a NY-style bagel, as the local scene is dominated by Noah\u2019s round puffy rolls. But prices are extremely high - you regularly pay $3 for hot water and a tea bag - and other prices match that level. There\u2019s a 3\u20134% surcharge everywhere to cover a city-sponsored health care plan for restaurant workers. 3) the professional sports scene is OK, though you have to leave SF (for now) to see the Warriors, who will return to SF in 2018 after 50+ years in East Oakland. Pro football has moved to distant Santa Clara in Silicon Valley, major league hockey and soccer are more than an hour away in San Jose. American League baseball is in Oakland, but the Giants are here in beautiful AT&T Park, flying their three World Series pennants. Dynamic pricing makes Giants tickets expensive, though not as bad as tix for Yankee Stadium or Fenway. Games always sell out, so you usually have to buy through scalpers online or near the Park. 4) the City spends a lot on the public library system. If you are patient, you can check out both hard cover and eBooks, as well as DVDs, through the library. You can go into any branch and find a wide selection of magazines and newspapers in many languages. 5) the City also spends a lot on the public parks. Everyone knows Golden Gate Park, but there are more than 200 parks and open spaces in our 49 sq.mi. city. These are widely and heavily used by everyone, with the occasional conflicts over dogs running free and homeless encampments. We also have the Golden Gate National Recreation Area on the northern waterfront. What was formerly a military area (the Presidio) now has lots to see and do. 6) people\u2019s tolerance is fraying a bit from what it once was. The City has long had a live-and-let-live attitude, which is why we became a destination for \u201chippies\u201d in the 60s and a safe home for the LGBT community. The weather and available services have made SF attractive to the homeless, who are a highly visible presence in and near downtown and the major tourist areas. One local government after another has tried to address the problem, so far without success. Many of our local tech companies are trying to help, too, but there are also a lot of newer arrivals with a sense of entitlement and less of a sense of community. There\u2019s much more, but this list was intended to complement other answers to this question. Finally, to reinforce the point: if you come here, bring money. There are good values to be found, but it takes a while to find them. Last, just because it\u2019s June or July doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s warm here. May and September are the warmest months, but you will need a jacket or coat in the evening. If you forget that, the Union Square Macy\u2019s sells them year-round. ",

            "answer_text": "THE GOOD:I have lived in San Francisco for 9 years and can tell you it is a very awesome place. It is very diverse, in its ethnic makeup and gastronomy, and you meet a lot very interesting and smart people here. If you like professional sports, you have a lot of options in the Bay Area: 49ers, Raiders, Giants, A's, Warriors,  Sharks, and Earthquakes. There are also a lot of 'cute' neighborhoods in San Francisco, such as Hayes Valley, Inner Sunset, La Misi\u00f3n/The Mission, Bernal Heights, Cole Valley, Laurel Heights, Inner Richmond, etc, etc, and all these neighborhoods have 'legit' personalities. By that I mean you can walk around these neighborhoods and feel they have their own personality and identity, which is something a lot of suburbs in Southern California - and arguably other burbs throughout the US of A - just don't have. San Francisco also has some pretty decent natural attractions: Golden Gate Park, Mount Sutro, the Presidio, Lake Merced, and a few other parks, which definitely make the city super attractive. The city is also super bikeable, and in fact the San Francisco bicycle coalition has a map with all the bike lanes throughout the city so you can travel more efficiently on your bike.  This city also has an amazing variety of eating establishments. If you crave Turkish food you can eat at a la Turca in the Tenderloin. Craving Burmese? No problem, just go to Pagan in the outer Richmond. Wanna try some awesome Peruvian Ceviche? No problem, all you have to do is visit one the many legit Peruvian restaurants in the city: Lim\u00f3n, Fresca, Piqueo, La Mar, etc. How about yummy mole enchiladas? Then you should definitely hit up El Toreador in West Portal. Japanese Izakaya anyone? Make sure you check out Sozai in the inner Sunset.  There are also a ton of breweries in the city, including Thirsty Bear, 21st Amendment, and Social, and in fact the microbrew culture is very deeply rooted here. Also, people are super chilled about cannabis, and even though it's not technically legal - you need a medical cannabis card to get your medicine at a dispensary - it is not at all uncommon to see people smoking a dubby on the street, particularly if you walk around the Tenderloin or Haight & Ashbury.  The city also has a pretty decent public transit system, and for $70 a month - as of October 2015, you can get a monthly MUNI pass that let's you take public transit system within SF all you want for that monthly period, which is definitely more economical than maintaining a vehicle.    THE BAD:SAN FRANCISCO IS VERY EXPENSIVE! I have lived in SF for 9 years and in my current 1-bedroom apartment since 2008. I am super fortunate to have rent control, and even with that I pay $1,600 a month for a 1-bedroom apartment. Now, that is considered cheap these days. How cheap? Well, my landlord has told me he could rent my apartment for $2,400 if he wanted to. He's not a mean guy, and his intention wasn't to be a jerk when he said this, but I know he is not kidding at all when he said this. Also, the building where I live was built around 1950, so it is by no means new. In fact, it is not at all uncommon to find 2-Bedroom apartments that cost $3,000-$3,500 a month to rent.  I used to share a 2-Bedroom apartment in a nice part of town - West Portal/Sunset - with roommates back in 2007-08 and our monthly rent was ~$1,750. I  guarantee you that same spot now rents for no less than $3,000 a month.  Now let's talk about buying property in San Francisco. I've been surveying the market for a little over a year now and IMHO there is very little value in buying property in SF right now. For example, there is this new apartment in the Mission - a historically Hispanic neighborhood that is being hypergentrified -  called 'Vida' where 2-Bedroom condos - probably really nice ones - are being offered at around $1.4 million. Yes, $1,400,000!!!! If you don't believe me just Google and you'll see I'm not kidding. There are also a lot of new condos being built, but they are virtually all luxury and you have to shell out at least $600,000 for a 1-Bedroom, which seems a bit excessive in my opinion.  If you are fortunate enough to have the financial wherewithal to live in San Francisco, then go for it since this is a great city. However, the cost of living makes it difficult for the middle class to survive.  If you're one of the lucky SF residents that have rent control, then you're cool, but if you're a young person that wants to move to this idylic liberal mecca you're going to need some serious financial resources to make ends meet in this town.  So, there you have it. Just wanted to wanted to share my sincere opinion about the state of San Francisco in the fall of 2015. ",

I\u2019m on the phone talking with suburban relatives or friends and announce I need to go to the market to get more wine. I take them along of course, talking with them as I go downstairs, across the street, and back. Ten minutes later they ask when I\u2019m going to the market and I tell them I already went. They\u2019re astonished. They have to go get the car, drive at least ten minutes to a package store or a 7/11, and back, and all I did was go downstairs and across the street. Then again, my rent controlled 600 sq foot, 1 bedroom apartment fits in almost everybody\u2019s suburban kitchen/dining area or two car garage.

And many of the rest of the native born are also the dimmest bulbs on the sign. Not the San Francisco of Herb Caen, or any of the books I\u2019d been reading since high school. Look at all the presumed Sierra Club and Greenpeace members driving cars or taking Uber instead of transit. City DPW trucks spraying water on the streets in the midst of an historic drought, with signs saying the water is recycled, yet there\u2019s the truck refilling at a small hydrant, the ones connected to the Yosemite water supply! Then again, when you go home from here you\u2019re going to be surprised at how white your home town is, even if it\u2019s San Diego. When they say diverse, many are only mouthing the words, but San Francisco is diverse. If you don\u2019t think everyone talking in a foreign language is talking about you, you\u2019ll love hearing all the languages spoken here\u2014-the guttural tones of Cantonese turned me off, and then I heard someone speaking Mandarin\u2014-Wow\u2014-I thought French was beautiful on the ear! And the funny thing is, the foreigners are the polite ones, always with a hello, or a good morning, it\u2019s the native born (Black and White) who are rude. Like me. I never say good morning unless so greeted. I had to work on it in Paris. Are you married? Frequent articles here detail the difficulty in meeting people. It\u2019s a common gripe amongst the 20\u201330 something set. We have a lot of broken people here and it shows in the dating scene. I discovered this late in life, after a trip to New Orleans in 2000. I walked into Lafayette In Exile (a gay bar) at 4pm, with a mindset that gay bars were for meeting people for sex. I spent the next 14 hours in conversation with various patrons, no sex in sight, nor wanted. WOW, I thought! I couldn\u2019t wait to get home and try this. From the start it was quite clear: Even at a bar, here (gay or straight) most people don\u2019t want to talk to people they don\u2019t know, or who aren\u2019t like them. They\u2019ll come right out and say it, they don\u2019t want to talk to you, or they\u2019re with friends (but you\u2019re not invited to join them) etc etc etc. Yet, the city is beautiful\u2014-not itself, necessarily though. It\u2019s streetscape is often banal, uninteresting, but the views will leave you breathless. The view up the hill or down from it. The view of a certain street of houses, or of a group of trees\u2026 The food is unbelievable. It is here where I realized that food and sex have a lot in common and eating is not just for nourishment but sheer decadent pleasure. If you succeed in hanging on, a rent control apartment and all, you\u2019ll find yourself asking your partner on a sunny day \u201cSunny side or shady?\u201d meaning which side of the street (do you want to stay cool, or are you feeling chilled?). You become a weather wimp. Three days of temperatures over 80 and you\u2019re complaining of the heat\u2014-if the fog doesn\u2019t show up and send it packing. Three days of rain and your life is ruined, when is this damned rain going to end? It\u2019s December 12th, it\u2019s fifty five degrees (the same temperature it was on August 12th under thick fog) and you\u2019re walking about in your newest coat and winter wear, feeling so stylish and complaining of the cold (again it\u2019s the same temperature it was in August) and your Aunt in Minneapolis laughs. \u201cCold? It\u2019s ten below zero here. How much pot have you been smoking?\u201d You watch the news of polar vortices and named blizzards, the worst on record, and you\u2019re walking to Sausalito, across the Golden Gate Bridge in January on a clear blue sky day, with your hoodie tied around your waist\u2014-the world has never been so beautiful and yet here you are. All the freaks, all the self entitled assholes, all the losers, addicts and PC redundant nowhere to be seen. Wow you say to yourself. Wow. Yep. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like to live here. ",

            "answer_text": "San Francisco is and always will be my favorite major city in California and one of my favorite cities in the world. However, it is also arguably the city in California most affected by the overall economic trends of the last 40 years, which makes it something of a cautionary tale/acquired taste. The good: Of the three major economic, political, and cultural hubs of the state\u2014Sacramento, San Francisco, LA\u2014San Francisco easily has the best public transit infrastructure, cultural assets, and culinary scene and is competitive with LA in terms of its arts scene in the performing, visual, and literary arts. (People seem to view San Jose as a separate thing from the rest of the Bay Area these days\u2014it\u2019s basically urban sprawl and represents the worst of post-war urban planning in the state.)Unlike every other major city in the state, it was planned as a city in the traditional sense prior to the tax revolt of the 1970s and wasn\u2019t completely redeveloped afterwards to make the population utterly dependent on cars, like much of Southern California was. This means it has an organic-feeling density and compactness that you don\u2019t get in Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Jose, or San Diego.Despite out of control levels of redevelopment and gentrification over the last 40 years, it has maintained a good balance of urban development and green space and has retained a significant chunk of its historical identity.It has one of the most progressive health departments of any city or county in the United States.It has some of the best libraries in the state of California, the United States, and the world, owing largely to the fact that the region is home to one of the best public universities in the world and also one of the best private universities in the world.It has some of the best hospitals in the country.To me, it\u2019s the city that most best utilizes being on the coast of California in the stateThe bad:As others have pointed out, it\u2019s basically unaffordable to live here due to the compounded effects of 40 years of gentrification, the Great Recession, and two major tech bubbles on each side of the Great Recession. A single bedroom in a shared housing situation in a bad neighborhood will run you at least $1100 a month.Most of the people who work in San Francisco live outside it due to that, which has contributed greatly to the housing crisis in the region and the breakdown of its public transit systems.This has also led to a homelessness epidemic in San Francisco. Many people in the city with full-time jobs that pay well are living in their cars. And people are living and dying in the streets in numbers that should be legitimately alarming.The one major housing development built in my lifetime in the city was just shown to be radioactive.Bottom line, if you are single, have flexible living standards, and feel culture and decent public transit are important to you OR you are super wealthy, it\u2019s a great place to live. For everyone else, it\u2019s kind of a nightmare. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s hard to say it better than many of the other answers here have. The walkability, the food, the weather, the poop on the sidewalks, the homelessness. They couldn\u2019t be more right. Since I was A2A, I\u2019ll answer with two things that pop into my head most readily. They do not constitute a complete answer on their own, and i include by reference all those other answers. But I\u2019ll do one pro and one con. I\u2019ll start with the con and this might seem sort of bizarre to pick out of nowhere but it\u2019s something that has grated on my nerves more than anything about living in the city - grocery shopping. This didn\u2019t used to be a problem when I was a student and would go at random hours on weekdays. But shopping on evenings and weekends gives me PTSD. I\u2019ve just never seen more crowded grocery stores in my life. It is incredibly hard to shop at, for instance, Trader Joe\u2019s, when the lines for the cash registers are so long, people are lined up down the aisles and are thus standing in front of the wares you would like to view and consider buying. Some lucky people go shopping with a roommate and/or partner and thus one person can get in line immediately while the other person goes and selects all the products to buy. Very efficient! But for those of us shopping on our own, it\u2019s depressing. And if you like to purchase things at lots of different stores (x place has good produce, y has cheap staples, etc.) god help you. In the bigger picture, small shop/street level commerce in this city mystifies me so much. There are always new restaurants opening and somehow they are always soooo busy. There could not be too many grocery stores. But somehow, my previous neighborhood had a nail shop, dry cleaner and dog washing boutique on like every other block, all of which seemed empty most of the time, but still stayed in business. It\u2019s a mystery. What I loved is just that there is always something to do. There is always something going on that is interesting or that you stumble upon while out for a bike ride. You don\u2019t even have to plan! In fact, there are so many things that are still on my to-do list (like going to Cal Academy or trying the toast at Trouble) but I never make it to because there\u2019s always something else going on that weekend that diverts us. One other minor thing - having lived in the Bay Area for 4\u20135 years now, plus or minus, and having been born and raised in Southern California, I\u2019m just now starting to miss having a real summer. At first I was more than happy to not have any 90 degree days ever and to have constant mild weather. But now, once mid-July comes and I still have to put on my wool peacoat every morning to go to work, it\u2019s a little sad. I keep reminding myself that we\u2019ll have a lovely September and October, and we\u2019ve just planted some tomatoes in anticipation of the warmer weather, but I\u2019ve spent most of the last month heading out east looking for a little warmth. Last weekend, we went to Pinnacles National Park to go hiking and it was over 90 degrees and I almost passed out. I used to live in a desert where the average summer day temp was about 104, but now I\u2019m a wimp! ",

            "answer_text": "If there\u2019s one word that could characterize my life right now, it\u2019s the last one I could have predicted: stability.  I graduated from college this past May, found my first job in tech, and moved to San Francisco at the beginning of September, when summer was just starting to fade into fall. Having never lived in this city before, it took me about two months to get comfortably settled in. It seemed like the right amount of time to lull myself into a happy reverie\u200a\u2014\u200ato get into a familiar rhythm, to feel like I had things under control. Nowadays I\u2019m used to my life constantly taking 180\u00b0 shifts, so much so that I\u2019m genuinely surprised when things go according to plan. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m still gingerly waiting for something to break. But if tomorrow the sky starts to fall, at least I will have taken nothing for granted today. Self-fulfillment can be a complex beast to dissect\u200a\u2014\u200abut when it comes down to it, it can be a binary one as well. To the question of whether I like my life, the answer is a strong yes. And just in case you were wondering, the honeymoon phase of life in California looks like this:  (Twitter\u2019s sunny rooftop deck. Great spot for lunching and drinking smoothies.) Every morning I come to the office and arrive in a literal playground. Twitter\u2019s headquarters are full of natural lighting and airy d\u00e9cor, with cute bird puns fluttering around every corner. I am happy when I come to work\u200a\u2014\u200aI feel valued, like my contributions matter\u200a\u2014\u200aand I am surprised at what a positive impact this makes in my life. Of course, it helps tremendously that all my basic needs are taken care of. I am fairly compensated, I am well-fed, I am warm. And despite living in one of the most expensive cities in America, I have a sublease on an apartment in a safe neighborhood, I have great healthcare coverage, and I have ample time to pursue my interests at the end of each day. Having experienced what it\u2019s like to not have all these benefits, they are now indispensable to my quality of life. Just holding up my healthcare card makes me feel like I\u2019ve cheated my way up Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. I know that my European friends would laugh at me for touting as luxuries what they would deem necessities. But I count my blessings every damn day. In terms of material possessions, I don\u2019t own much that I couldn\u2019t fit into an oversized suitcase. Outside of expensive electronic devices, my most prized possessions are the souvenirs that I\u2019ve taped to the far end of my wall. Every few days, I dotingly supplement this growing paper collage with new additions\u200a\u2014\u200aphotos, ticket stubs, cards, postcards, stickers and hand-written letters\u200a\u2014\u200awhich accumulate in lockstep with new events in my life. My friends are scattered all across the world now, but I like the people who are around me. San Francisco is a city where the power brokers wear 100% cotton hoodies, deploy laser-sharp judgements of competence, Lyft and Uber everywhere, drink $7 organic fair-trade coffees on their way to work, and can never stop talking about tech. To put it lightly, it\u2019s an interesting\u200a\u2014\u200aif highly specialized\u200a\u2014\u200acrowd. Perhaps what I like the most about this city is that the games people play here are explicit, with the rules clearly demarcated. Everyone buys into the premise from the beginning; chaos can ensue from there. This sentiment goes a long way towards explaining why people in San Francisco are so obsessed with board games. After all, it is a truth universally acknowledged that recurring Avalon, Coup, and Secret Hitler nights are a critical staple of the technorati\u2019s social scene. (A risk-free venue for plotting political power plays, perhaps? The world may never know!) Networks here are particularly close-knit, because everyone seems to know each other from [insert top university/tech employer/highly specific shared interest group/elite fellowship here]. Since having these affiliations means undergoing rigorous selection processes that ultimately optimize for a similar set of criteria, you end up with a city full of young, intelligent, and like-minded transplants, who, incidentally, all converge into one location for the same reason\u200a\u2014\u200atheir careers. Moreover, since even the outwardly diverse are not significantly different from anyone else in their cohorts, you get a perfect recipe for what a philosopher might call \u201cGirardian terror.\u201d San Francisco is homogenizing faster than it can diversify because the people who are self-selected to be here end up living in the same high-rises, working at the same places, shopping at the same stores, eating at the same restaurants, reading the same books, playing with the same apps, even working out in the same gyms at the same times. Unsurprisingly, this creates a perfect bubble\u200a\u2014\u200aa perfect mirrortocracy. And six months out, the Silicon Valley bubble reminds me a lot of another bubble as well. But that\u2019s a story for another time :) ",

            "answer_text": "I moved to San Francisco in desperation to get back to the western part of the US from Chicago, hoping that I would eventually move to Seattle, Portland or Los Angeles; 20 years later it's hard to imagine living anyplace else.  There are more than 100 best things about living in the City; here are my top five:  Diversity isn't tolerated, it's celebrated. From the rich ethnic/racial mix of residents, to events such as Bay-to-Breakers, the LGBT Pride Parade, the Black & White Ball, Fleet Week to Balmy Alley, people in San Francisco value many different things. It may not be our individual taste but we think that relishing the difference a core part of what makes San Francisco great.Stunning geography; it's hard to imagine a more beautiful setting combing a deep water bay, the Pacific Ocean, hills in the City and mountains nearby. Even the fog that rolls over the coastal hills - something that I call the Steven Spielberg fog machine because it looks like something that it straight out of Hollywood special effects - grows on you.Location; while it's great to live in the City, you can get to and connect with people with ease around the world. Europe is a morning call, Tokyo or Shanghai can be how you finish up your afternoon. If it's foggy in the City you can always get away to Sonoma. Tahoe or Deer Valley is nearby for skiing, or catch a flight to Park City. Vancouver, San Diego, Denver and Phoenix can all be day trips. Surf on the coast, or hang glide from Mount Tam. It's all here.A city of neighborhoods; while it has the feel of a bigger city, the way I experience San Francisco is that it's block by block. Noe Valley is different from the Castro is different from Duboce Triangle is different from the Mission is different from Bernal Heights. Small city - lots of neighborhoods, with usually a sense that people take pride in where they live and who they are.Best food in the world; combine a friendly climate to having things locally grown, ethnic diversity and people who appreciate difference and you get some of the best food in the world.  Where else could Charles Phan open up a shop on Valencia Street and become world famous, Craig and Annie Stoll start with a hole in the wall and become celebrated for their graceful service and great food, or Tartine Bakery move into the City from the suburbs and be the toast of the coast - all with blocks of each other?That's my 5 - I'm sure there are hundreds more.

            "answer_text": "There's always an opportunity to do something interesting, or go some place that's stimulating, or else just wander around and see where your legs carry you.  It's a city filled with people trying to make the most of their situation and enjoy themselves doing it. But there's this tension between the various classes of residents that becomes more apparent every passing year. It's cold and windy for long stretches of time, particularly during the early summer months, although the weather might be completely different a mile away from where you're standing.   There are always bars, restaurants and nightclubs coming and going, although in recent years, it seems like they are mostly going, being replaced with condo construction.   There's a tangible sense of decay in the structures, and sometimes in the people, that have been around for long periods of time.  In a sense, that's part of the allure.  The history of the city needs to be actively preserved, lest it simply crumble to dust underneath a corrosive blanket of fog.   The history of the city seems to repeat itself in these looping boom and bust cycles.  Mostly boom, actually, but every now and then a major crisis happens which tests your determination to remain here.   Some parts of the city have smelled like urine for decades.  Other parts have smelled even worse.  There is poop on the ground in pretty much every neighborhood, although the source of it varies by neighborhood as well.  You smell pot smoke frequently.  Despite this, there is very little smog or otherwise noticeable air pollution on most days.  It has the cleanest air of any major city I've been to around the world.   There is a lot of contradiction and conflict within the city, and you get a sense of the pent up frustrations that people carry around with them after decades of waiting for a muni vehicle that will never arrive, or hoping their neighbor will finally get the message and quiet down after 11pm on a Tuesday night, or watching seemingly permanent encampments of homeless people fouling up the alleyways and underpasses. There is a pervasive sense of paranoia that next year's newcomers will drive up the rents for everybody and drive out all of the eccentricity and charm.   Most of all, it has a sense of energy and vibrancy that seems to be utterly lacking from the rest of the Bay Area - parts of Oakland and Berkeley notwithstanding. The most consistently satisfying recreational activity for me has been cycling around the city in the late morning or early afternoon, getting lunch somewhere, and then continuing to another destination and getting a beer.  Riding from my place up towards the Golden Gate Bridge, through the Presidio has always been a great experience, as has riding out to the Mission, through the Lower Haight.  Even with that, however, you can feel the tension and conflict mounting with each passing year. ",

            "answer_text": "San Francisco Home Sweet Home. Having been born in 1972, we played outside all day, every day,   given the chance, which we were.  You knew all the faces that lived on your block. We could walk home from school alone (if we had to). When your mother took you to the park, the kids on the block that were your buddies came along. When you needed a cup of sugar, you really could borrow some from your neighbor. Your next door neighbors dad coached the local PAL baseball team. We wore our roller skates from Sun-up til Sun-Down. You remembered the name Kevin Collins, because nothing like that had even existed to us before. The only time you saw someone begging for change or homeless is when you went downtown and walked on Market Street. We rode the bus for a quarter. With One Dollar you could get yourself a Snickers Bar AND 3 more for your friends from Woolworth's. An elememtary Catholic school education was attainable for $50. a month. Christmas shopping included a trip to Emporium Cpapwell's downtown. You could climb a mountain, visit a park, the Zoo, the Academy of Science, ride a Cable Car and watch the Sunset from Ocean Beach all in one day and still be home in time to watch the Dukes of Hazzard or Solid Gold. At leaat that's how I remember it.  I appreciate the fact that I was Born and Raised in this beautiful city. Although it saddens me that too many of us that were born and raised here, can't afford to live here as adults. I too have chosen to raise my children here. I know its a different time and a totally different experience for them and they may decide to make their lives elsewhere one day...but my Girls know San Francisco is home because this is where our heart is.

Number of times police called for things that happened right outside my window? = 5 (all in one apartment of two) in the other apartment? = 0.

Happened many times every day.Times the bus was so packed it just avoided stopping leaving people stranded at the Bus stops? also every day.Distance walked each day? 5-10 miles. Enjoyment factor? Depended on whether it was uphill or down!  I was never fitter, though.Times I rode the iconic cablecar? Zero.

If I will not be working from home, I strap on my computer bag and ride my bike down to a local cafe, purchasing items every now and again to earn my keep. Mostly, the cafe is filled with tech-minded people working on software code but you do get the people hung over from the previous night's adventures and the occasional couple that want to smoke a joint while sipping their coffee out in the garden (we have lots of gardens in San Francisco). When it is time for dinner, there are some great restaurants within walking distance, a bus ride, or inexpensive car service. for me, the Mission is for the weekends with free-flowing margaritas and great Mexican food. During the work week, I enjoy heading to the Richmond district for Vietnamese, Thai, or Korean. Visiting friends is something of a regular thing as most city goers do not have family nearby so we are each other's family. We meet up for drinks, we walk around neighborhoods to see what is new and check out new shops. We always like to try out the new restaurants, and we make use of the open spaces to relax and unwind. On hot days, the best place to be is outside the house because even most rich people do not have air conditioning, so it is off to the park to get a good view of the city, drink some wine, laugh, and eat snacks until the sun goes down.

            "answer_text": "Fire.   Interesting Fact 0: The City burned to the ground 6 times before the 1906 earthquake and fire.  After 1906 - it became difficult to get insurance in some locations of the city because of the lack of water/firefighting capabilities. Interesting Fact 1: The current Water System is capable of covering a city block (100,000 square feet) with water to a depth of 25 feet in one day. Interesting Fact 2: The Golden FIre Hydrant saved Mission-Dolores in 1906.  It marks the hydrant that continued to pour water even after all the other hydrants stopped.  here's the story:  http://www.naalarm.com/bill/golden.htm Interesting Fact 3: There are cisterns all over the city to help in the next fire.  Taking a lesson from the Pioneers and their construction of cisterns, fifty-four of the old cisterns built as far back as 1860 were repaired and placed in service. In addition to these eighty-five new reinforced concrete cisterns were built, making a total of 139. The new cisterns were built to contain 75,000 gallons each, while the old ones, built of brick contain varying amounts of from 32,000 gallons to 90,000 gallons.   The result - there are cisterns all over the city (see map below).  Firemen can literally drop a hose into the cisterns in the case of complete water-system breakdown:   The Cisterns are visible throughout the city as brick circles (or semi-circles) - and if you see a Green Fire Hydrant - it means there's a cistern nearby.         A green Fire Hydrant means it is connected to a cistern. A typical Family inground pool (18'x25') has about 25,000 Gallons of water. The largest cisterns in SF are 90,000 gallons.  There are 172 cisterns strategically spread throughout SF, totaling 11 million gallons of auxiliary water, enough to cover the city 1.25\u2033 deep. The water system established for fire-fighting is pretty neat and forward thinking.  Here's a great backgrounder by the SFFD: http://www.sfmuseum.org/quake/awss2.html I should note that it is a tad dated in places, but Water systems don't necessarily change much over the years - here's a great excerpt about the \"user friendliness\" of a VAX-4000.  The two Central Control Processors (CCPs) are based on a VAX 4000 platform running a software package with a graphic user interface. This is a very user-friendly computer program that simplifies masses of technical jargon into pictures and icons on a television monitor for ease of operation and speed. ",

            "answer_text": "Lived in SF from 1997\u20132003, and it was my first experience living in a big city. That said, I\u2019m glad I lived there at that time because it\u2019s gone south in so many ways. I\u2019m not going to discuss the weather, etc, as that\u2019s been covered but will offer up my own observations: When I lived in SF it was at the dawn of the tech/Internet revolution so it had more of its \u201clegacy charm\u201d, a period before big tech companies would swoop in and scoop up all the real estate. Seemed more quaint and more like \u201cold SF\u201d. Mind you, we were all still using Netscape Navigator as our browser, AOL or EarthLink as our dial-up service on a 56k modem, and accessing the still primitive Internet on one of those candy-colored iMacs with nary a mobile phone to be seen. Son of a bitch, seems like ancient history now, doesn\u2019t it? You could bike through town without feeling like you were tempting fate. you could easily get a table at a restaurant, or go grocery shopping, etc, without waiting forever. I had a 1 bedroom in Noe Valley which had a small alcove that acted as a second bedroom that a friend utilized for 3 years or so. Total rent on a clean, newly remodeled 1 bedroom in a popular neighborhood? $1500. You\u2019d pay double for that now. Some things that I miss about the city: hopping on a trolley car (rather than the more modern but boring Muni cars), shopping \u2014 or just browsing for hours \u2014 at Tower Records, Buster\u2019s Cheesesteaks on Columbus Ave in North Beach for late night post-clubbing grub (which has been there since the first time I\u2019d seen SF around circa 1983 and is just as good now as it was then), the Halloween street party scene in the Castro before a bunch of violent lunatics ruined it (RIP), going on a date once to Musee Mechanique, walking into The Palace Hotel just to feel the old-school charm of it, the various clubs and music venues \u2014 does anyone remember Polly Ester\u2019s?, Cafe du Nord (RIP), dating at a time before the nasty \u201cswipe right\u201d apps made dating awful, not being charged an arm and a leg for dinner or drinks or parking or whatever else has been seriously inflated since then, being able to walk through sketchy parts of SOMA and the Mission without feeling like you had a target on your back (but then, I\u2019m a 6\u20194\u201d guy so likely a different perspective), working in an artist\u2019s loft full of filmmakers and post-production people at a time when said artists could still comfortably live in the city (and, coincidentally, was probably one of the best periods in my life as far as my career and feeling free and liberated enough to do what I truly wanted to do), a time when the city wasn\u2019t so over-the-top gentrified/entitled/hyper-liberal-to-the-point-where-being-garden-variety-progressive-isn\u2019t-\u201chardcore\u201d-enough, the great musicians and artists I\u2019d meet, knowing that certain people like \u201cthe Twins\u201d and other eccentrics like Frank Chu (12 Galaxies) shared the city with you, showing your visiting friends and family around the city and taking pride in doing so, hearing that Tony Bennet song and feeling in your heart that you, too, \u201cleave your heart in San Francisco\u201d every time you depart the city. I live in the North Bay now and much prefer it. The patina has faded from the old SF charm, especially in the wake of losing people like Robin Williams, Herb Caen, Harvey Milk and others who gave this city real grit and character. I still commute and work downtown/SOMA and, on occasion, I will stroll over to The Palace, walk inside, and admire its history and sense of place \u2014 and, now and then, when the fog rolls in I can even feel a little bit of that old San Francisco feeling stir in my heart. It\u2019s a jaded mistress but a sassy one all the same. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve lived in SF for about a year now and here are my thoughts: The good: The diversity - you meet all kinds of people here, you get to try different food from beef noodle soup in chinatown to the best burritos in mission districtSocially active - SF social scene is very much like NYC when it comes to activities / events. People join social leagues to play sports and clubs to climb / run. It\u2019s a great way to meet people. There\u2019s always something going on the weekends.Bike lanes - probably one of the most bike friendly cities I\u2019ve lived in, bikers get huge wide lanes and drivers are oftentimes more scared of bikers than the other way around. still you should wear a helmetScenic sights - go for a scenic stroll at land\u2019s end, take a picture at golden gate bridge, appreciate the architecture palace of fine arts, SF is loaded with beautiful sightsNature access - need to get out of the city? just take the ferry to angel\u2019s island to bike around or drive across the golden gate bridge to hike at mt tam. Yosemite and Tahoe are just a few hours away if you need to immerse yourself in natureTech scene - SF is a great place to be if you like tech. 93% of what happens in silicon valley tv show is true. Just be prepared to not get sucked into the tech bubble (i\u2019ll explain later)The bad: Weather - SF is cold when it\u2019s supposed to be hot and hot when it\u2019s supposed to be cold (except for only a month). Year round you\u2019ll need to bring a jacket wherever you go because you just don\u2019t know. Also unsafe to wear shorts if you get cold easilyHomelessness - it\u2019s pains me to see the amount of homeless people on the streets, especially around civic center and fidi area. 33% are there because of some sort of substance abuse, another 33% because of mental health, and the remaining because of financial reasons. The best way to help is to talk to them as humans, not give them money (buy food if you can or even better direct them to a shelter that can help)Tech bubble - tech reigns supreme in SF and while many enjoy the kool-aid perks of free food, laundry services and ping pong tables, its easy to be carried away and forget what the real world looked like. its only later that you realize that all of these perks are just another way of keeping you late at work.High expenses - SF housing prices are the highest in the nation because of the influx of tech companies. It\u2019s hard to save money when you\u2019re paying premium rent prices, eating out and taking Uber / Lyft around. I\u2019ve resorted to biking and cooking grocery as much as I can to saveDating scene - dating in sf as a guy is tough because there are just more guys in tech than women. most people also don\u2019t want to settle down and want to be in the forever vacation mode where they enjoy each other\u2019s company but don\u2019t want to ever grow up.All in all, I think SF is a good place to live if you\u2019re a young and working in tech but if you want to raise a family and settle down, I think there are better places (e.g. Austin, Orange County). I started a YT channel about life in SF. Hope this helps gives a glimpse on what life is like as a young urban professional.  ",

            "answer_text": "This question is asked a lot, and in contrast to some of the other answers I see, I\u2019ll try to say what it IS and ISN\u2019T. It\u2019s like,( and it\u2019s always BEEN like); You will get the San Francisco that you EXPECT, and also the San Francisco you DON\u2019T expect\u2026 and a lot of that depends on where you are coming FROM. First: It is not a huge metropolis, like London or New York, and people who compare and then belittle it , are being unrealistic and dim witted! If You want a world scale MAJOR city, San Francisco is only playing at it. It is only 7 x7 miles,( being surrounded by water on 3 sides and big hills on one, (where the airport lives!) But it is a very dense city, population wise. It is not a sprawl of suburbs, with front yards and swing sets or pools in the back. It\u2019s a very \u201c concrete\u201d city, but it\u2019s full of lovely parks, large and many small, it\u2019s easy to find a patch of grass if that\u2019s What you really need. THEY ARE FREE AND PLENTYFUL, and a fair number have places to let your dog run or chase balls. Some even allow children. It is also, largely a rather antique, European style , small to mid size city with a dense and fairly large down town, and narrow streets, one way streets and hills. Of late, with the Tech. Boom, we are full up with new arrivals. I find they rather tend to make snap judgements and sometimes expect the city to adapt to THEM. This place is most likely going to change YOU. People come here to get that! If you DONT like change, then you might think twice, or at least visit before you move here. It is a VERY multi cultural place, with many different languages and forms of dress. If you are not culturally tolerant, You will probably NOT enjoy living here. Many people don\u2019t speak English or they have thick accents, so patience is almost an every day necessity, Do not expect your Post Office Clerk or even your Doctor to be from the U.S. or speak without an accent. If that seems anti American or WRONG to you, you will be annoyed a lot! If you consider it an \u201c opportunity \u201c to meet a new person from a different place, you might have fun! Most long time San Franciscans are quite color blind, and we are proud of our diversity. We LIKE that we can meet, and live next door to, and work with people from all over the world, without traveling more than a block or a mile! I see constant jibes at the bus system, the lack of bike paths, traffic, etc. But the people most complaining about it, seem to be the most obvious contributors to exactly what they complain about! We are having a \u201c boom\u201d and many people are coming in, and our infra structure is stretched! I rarely feel like I \u201c need to take a shower\u201d, after riding Muni\u2026 but I\u2019ve been here 45 years! I rarely see human excrement, VERY RARELY, ( and I live where people complain about it the most! ). Maybe I don\u2019t look hard enough, I mean , I don\u2019t sniff dank corners or bushes in parking lots\u2026? It just ISNT THAT BAD! You WILL see a lot of \u201c homeless people\u201d and street life. Remember, it is very dense, and small and so the homeless with encampments or tents or sleeping in parks or right on sidewalks really stand out, and when you add the drugged out, the winos , etc. it can seem intense. But they are NOT everywhere, and there are plenty of neighborhoods where there are few or none. People, of late; paint very extreme pictures of the negative aspects. If it\u2019s what you want, there are no end of things to complain about. But considering how many wealthy people, who could live many other places , want to live here, and the incredible beauty, mild weather, and perfect location , and that it is close to skiing, beaches, mountains, camping, and every type of recreation and sport, many people consider it quite a privilege to be a San Franciscan. It comes at a much higher price lately. To pay it and then complain seems like an unwise investment! Some of the challenges; It is INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE, especially to rent or buy housing, and if you\u2019re on ANY kind of a budget, housing is VERY difficult to find. If you have a service industry job, or are just starting out, expect to share digs. Parking is very difficult. Walk or take a bus or ride a bike if you are brave, but our streets are narrow and that\u2019s just the way it IS in a Victorian meets modern city! The bus system, much reviled on Quora, is actually quite well laid out, and one or two busses will get you most anywhere. It isn\u2019t always on time, and sometimes people board who live rough and smell or act like it, but plenty of well heeled people use it too. ::For Visitors and Short Term stays: Hotels are also expensive and you have to stay too far away to do much better out of town. There are tons of Uber and Lyft cars, and shares, but this comes at the expense of traffic jams. Cabs are expensive. There are plenty if you learn how to hail or use your real telephone, but DO have an exact street address, they don\u2019t do corners! We do not have much \u201c corporate food\u201d, like fast food and chains, so don\u2019t plan on having dinner at \u201c Outback\u201d. We do have TONS of small cafes , and bistros of the most amazing ethnicities, and a fair number are really good. Fresh vegetables are common, and food is more \u201c home made\u201d than in the suburbs, but they may not all have corporate standards of cleanliness. The health department sorta works, You will rarely get sick with a little common sense! Grocery stores can be a bit hard to find, but they are here, and probably are more expensive than \u201c home\u201d. There is a tendency towards \u201c Organic\u201d and politically correct food.( \u201cFarm to Table\u201d, \u201c \u201clocally sourced\u201dand \u201c non GMO\u201d are frequently claimed and who really knows? ) It all costs more, and to find \u201c plain old food\u201d to prepare, You\u2019ll need to go to China Town, The Mission, or the Richmond,( where the food markets are largely Chinese or Spanish). Following Chinese consumers will save you money and find you better fresh ingredients, but shop early and prepare to dive into the crowd. Queuing is Unheard of there. There, and lots of ways to spend endless amounts of money if consumption is your thing. You will get used to carrying a jacket or wearing a hoody because if the fog doesn\u2019t reach you round 6:30 pm, the cold air and wind WILL. This is a maritime city and the Pacific is way too cold to swim in without a wet suit. They stroll the beach in Bikinis in LA , not here! Forget shorts and sleeveless tops, or clothes in bright summer colors, rather prepare for Fall weather that can change quickly, but you rarely need to be heavily or lightly dressed. It\u2019s mostly between 55 and 70 degrees and for most of US, that ain\u2019t half bad! I\u2019d take it over \u201c real weather\u201d , ANY DAY! I think Herb Caen called it something like \u201c our malfunctioning Air Conditioner\u201d that either \u201c kicks in or out, sometimes inconveniently\u2026. But come on it isn\u2019t SERIOUS! Picnics, walks in the park and on the beach, hanging out in coffee houses and bars or brew pubs, and attending free concerts, street fairs, and walking around taking pictures are free, or pretty affordable, and that\u2019s what we LIKE about it! So that\u2019s mostly the \u201c good\u201d and a little of the \u201c different\u201d. As for the questionable; I understand the recent anger of locals, myself included, as land developers are permanently ,( well ? It IS earthquake country and it IS a matter of time, so \u201c sorta permanently\u201d) changing the face and feel of our town. The landlords and developers are cramming as many people into questionably built , high cost housing , as is possible, and it\u2019s going up, at an alarming rate and looks haphazard and poorly planned. A small bungalow type house in the outer fog belt is over a million dollars to buy, and a very basic two bedroom place with a tiny bit of yard or a garage can easilly run $1.5 Million!( Hey, You can rent out the garage to a student and people ARE putting up and renting tents in thier tiny back yards! That\u2019s \u201c income\u201d property! For rental, a one bedroom apartment can easilly run $2,000t to $3500 a month! Businesses, long loved are being priced out of business, or demolished , and are being replaced with \u201c fake\u201d gourmet and ethnic fusion places that serve bad food, masquerading as some kind of connoisseure experience! Throngs of people are moving here WITH NO JOY, and driving prices up, trying to spend their way to the \u201c San Francisco Experience\u201d that never was, or live as though it\u2019s some horrible work camp that they simply must put up with! In FACT, they seem to be apalled that the city can\u2019t turn into some Midwestern suburb as soon as possible, and seem to dislike any aspect of living here that isn\u2019t planned out and sanitized with their peculiar sensibilities! Yes there are POOR people here , maybe where YOU live, but we don\u2019t have miles of dangerous slums, and ( sorry), NO they don\u2019t come here for the services, they are \u201c consumer failures\u201d, and are created here,having been shoved out of what little they could afford! Another \u201c good\u201d point is that SF still has very good services, including a great County Hospital and a fair assortment of emergency food, though not enough shelter. And YES, if you suspected that the \u201c poor\u201d ARE served in the Heart of the city on purpose, you are RIGHT! It is to make the most needy, VERY VISABLE to the better off, because ; those who tirelessly sacrifice to make things better, and those that know we breath the same air, and all that implies, know the poorest are the most easilly forgotten about, when hidden away. And THAT is pretty much what San Francisco is like, to ME.( OH YES, AND SOME OF US ARE RATHER \u201c PREACHY\u201d ahem\u2026). It\u2019s a \u201c liberal\u201d, international, yet quite provincial ,( compared to modern metropolises), quickly changeable city, in a beautiful place. it\u2019s going through one if it\u2019s many human transitions, that happen when it\u2019s not burning down or shaking itself to rubble. It is not exactly known for its conventionality OR it\u2019s predictability! If you want that just visit, and bring a lot of money, PLEASE! And REMEMBER\u2026. If you don\u2019t like it; You can ALWAYS change your name and \u201cmove to another state\u201d ,( both figuratively and literally!) ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends on who\u2019s asking. People from religious and/or socially conservative backgrounds might find our extremely open-minded and liberal culture mind-blowing, e.g. many people here are open about their sexuality: pansexuals, polyamorous people, LGBTQIA folks, etc.; people identify as whatever gender, gender fluid, or non-gendered without widespread disapproval. Not that we are free from hatred or crimes against the aforementioned, but they are generally accepted. Some things I find mind-blowing about this city - and surrounding areas - are: A person who lives here can surf and ski in the same day at the right time of year - surf at an SF beach, then drive 4 hours and ski in Tahoe. The beauty here is mind-blowing, as is the amount of homelessness. The proximity of some of the richest and poorest people in the country here is unbelievable. There are glorious redwoods less than an hour\u2019s drive to the North, South, and East of SF. There is a theater company that produces Shakespeare plays on Alcatraz Island. The audience has to walk around the island to see different scenes, and can be pulled away from the main action into side scenes with the actors. The Ohlone tribes that lived here before any other humans had everything they needed and lived in relative peace. A book, The Ohlone Way describes their societies in detail, and is a very good, though short, read. ",

Its alleged purpose was to celebrate the completion of the Panama Canal, but it was widely seen in the city as an opportunity to showcase its recovery from the 1906 earthquake. The fair was constructed on a 635 acre (2.6 km\u00b2) site in San Francisco, along the northern shore now known as the Marina. As noted above, after the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition the site had been sub-divided int Continue Reading",

Apart from the ancient presence of Native Americans living in this commodious part of the world, the history of European presence here is pretty recent by the standards of much of the rest of the world\u2014 like that of Europe, not to mention that of Greece, Egypt, etc. Early discovery of the SF Bay Area was frustrated by fog blocking view of the Bay\u2019s entrance by passing ships.

At the same time, San Francisco was unique and a wonderful city, there were so many different types of people, so many different age groups, some people not making a lot of money, others making tons of money, yet they were all able to make a sustainable living and reside in the city in one location or another.

There is a great deal of art in the city, and in nearby Berkeley and Oakland: symphonies, opera, jazz, rock, hip hop; painting, photography and other visual arts; many museums; and all kinds of theater from touring Broadway shows to performance art. Seeing this art, and being part of the art scene, is the main reason I moved to San Francisco 40 years ago.

Since the new owners are not covered by Prop. 13, they can expect to pay $18.000 per year in property tax. Since the house was built in 1910, everything seems unrealistic.
