            "answer_text": "It all boils down to how will you know your material. If you came in the studio not knowing a single like the guitar parts, keyboard parts, drums in any other element relevant to your song that you wish to record it will take you a significantly longer amount of time to get these tracks recording which could lead to you only being able to get one maybe two songs done in one session that\u2019s a four hour long session. If you come in knowing every element of your song lyrically and whatever role it is it you\u2019re playing you have mastered as well as the other members of your group with a higher success rate in completing songs within that four hour period. When I enter my own studio with the intent of writing a song I make sure that I understand how it flows musically and what it is I expect from myself and how I want to hear it back. By knowing this information and setting a goal for myself I can knock out 2 to 6 songs within a four hour period which does not include editing, mixing or mastering. Make sure you know your material down to a T and he could basically play with your eyes closed. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it all depends on how long it takes to do one individual track, and there is no definitive length of time for that, but if you take into account what actual bands have said, it takes about an hour per song for the tracking process and 30\u201360 minutes for the mix and master, and there is also the recording and over-dubbing of various instruments, so it could take longer than that; but at the minimum? About 1-and-a-half to 2-and-a-half hours per song, give or take. So you could probably get in around 2 songs in 4 hours. ",
