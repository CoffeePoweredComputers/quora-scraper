            "answer_text": "May be not. Some of his best songs came in the late 90s and early 2Ks (Be with you, Bailamos, Hero, Tonight etc). These were his chartbuster songs. The period from 2002 to 2008 was a dry spell for him. Although, he did make a comeback and have been producing good songs but I don't think his songs have been able to generate an impact which they did about 15\u201316 years back. Thanks. ",
