            "answer_text": "\u2018Losing track of Time\u2019 As far as I could understand, you mean to ask any or a combination of the following: How to forget for how long you have been studying?How to stop measuring how much time it took to cover a topic?How to get immersed in the reading and not getting distracted?Well, I\u2019ll cover them all one by one. In case you meant to ask something else, you can always update. 1~ How to forget for how long you have been studying: While studying, we generally measure time at two intervals - between reading and after finishing reading. The one done after finishing is actually a productive measurement. That lets us know the time we contributed for studying. However, if the quality of time spent is poor, the measurement is of no use, howsoever big it comes out to be. You must focus on the matter in hand, devote your full attention towards it and in the end you can observe how much time you contributed. That will make you feel accomplished. The measurement carried out between reading is waste of time and energy. It only symbolizes that you are more concerned about quantity than quality. For example: If you are checking the time after every five minutes just to realize that you haven\u2019t done enough or you won\u2019t be able to finish, it will do no good to you. That anxiety and pressure will deteriorate your performance and ultimately the quality of focus will be hampered. Even if you study for an hour, it will be of less use.

Because that helps you analyze where you lost your focus and your thoughts started wandering. But hey, let\u2019s make sure that you are not over-thinking about this, noting it down and deriving deviations out of it. Pheeww! Just spend a few seconds recapitulating the concept and see how long it took you to understand it completely. This exercise must take place within fractions of seconds.  Image source - Google 3~ How to get immersed in the reading and not getting distracted: Before explaining how to get immersed, let\u2019s make sure that you have switched off wi-fi on your phone or logged out of social media handles as phones can prove out to be major distractions. You might even be checking your phone by the excuse of measuring time when the actual purpose could be seeing notifications. Now, it\u2019s time for some tips on how to get immersed: Before beginning, meditate for 5 minutes. That\u2019ll clear out all thoughts from your mind.Imagine the entire process pre-hand as if you have already completed. This will make you believe that it\u2019s easy to do it.Bifurcate the material to be read into sections. Go through the chapter in an overview before reading thoroughly.Start reading with concentration. Observe yourself throughout the process.After each line/paragraph, ask yourself if you\u2019ve understood it - you can even speak it into your native language for your understanding.Mark the key words to make sure they enter your mind and stay there.Take frequent breaks. Small 5\u20136 min breaks in which you must not use electronic gadgets.In the beginning, it would seem a little difficult, but I assure you that slowly and steadily, this will enter into an automatic gear and you will realize how fast your reading speed becomes. The best part - you\u2019ll also be able to understand in one go.  Image source - Google Choice is yours! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think what you're asking is how do you enter the flow or be in the zone so that you're so completely focused on the task at hand that you lose track of time. If that's what you're asking, then environment is important. You need to be aware of certain stimuli that trigger entering the flow. I use two particular triggers to enter the flow so that I can do my most productive work. By far my preferred choice is to use a playlist of video game music that I've curated. The playlist is almost 4 hours long, and by listening to it I can remain focused for almost 4 hours without taking a break.My second choice is a trigger that takes place when I'm commuting. Here's when I do most of my productive writing. I travel by public transport a lot, so I use this time to write. The ambient noise and rocking bus or train is perfect for entering the flow.Your own stimuli will be different from mine. The key is to be aware of periods when you're in the flow, so that you can replicate them and control how and when you trigger them. ",
