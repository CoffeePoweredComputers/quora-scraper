            "answer_text": "hey there! I\u2019ve tried a loot of different online music downloaders, but they\u2019re all full of ads. The apps were buggy and didn\u2019t transfer music to my iPhone quickly. What\u2019s more, Apple has many format restrictions, so this means no FLAC files could land on my iPod. But I've recently discovered a good iTunes alternative - WALTR 2 for PC or Mac. it helps transfer music to an iPhone without syncing with iTunes. you can download the app and read about its features here: How to Transfer MP3, FLAC, APE to iPhone without iTunes it\u2019s quite simple to use so I can now explain a little bit.  first, connect an iPhone/iPod to your laptop via a usb wire and trust a device or with wifi (just connect it to the same network as your computer). then, if you already have some music or videos you\u2019d like to have on your iPhone (or iPod, for instance), drag a file and drop it into the app. of course you can drop a folder instead of separate files and everything will be transferred altogether. it takes several seconds to transfer music or short videos. if you want to download a film, you\u2019ll wait approximately 2 mins. aaand that\u2019s it! see, how it looks like:  by the way, you can also add videos to iPad or iPod or iPhone, PDFs or EPUB files to iPhone/iPad with WALTR. the quality remains the same, so no worries. hope it was useful! feel free to ask me anything:) ",
