            "answer_text": "The \u2018Home tone\u2019 is the tone with the lowest tension, where the melody feels the most at ease, most relaxed. A melody often starts out on this note and almost always ends here. A scale would begin on this tone. As the steps of a scale (and especially the chords/triads build on them) are refered to with Roman numbers, we could call the first step of the scale \u2018i\u2019. Another name (especially in classical or European termibology) is the \u2018tonic\u2019. But I like your term: \u2018home tone\u2019. If the first note/i/tonic/home feeling in a key is the tone A - voila, we are in the key of A. That\u2019s exactely why this specific key is given this letter as part of its name. ",
