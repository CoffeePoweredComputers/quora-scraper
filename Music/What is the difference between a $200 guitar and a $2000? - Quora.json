            "answer_text": "A $200 electric guitar has about $40 of materials, $40 of manufacturing costs, $40 of shipping, handling, storage and display, $40 of dealer markup and $40 of manufacturer profit. In other words, of your $200 guitar, $80 went on the guitar.  This is, of course, all generalised: every manufacturer will have its own pricing policies, its own costs, and so on. A notional $2,000 guitar has $470 of materials, $470 of manufacturing costs, $120 of shipping, handling, storage and display, $440 of dealer markup, $200 of manufacturer profit, and $100 each of research, marketing, and post-sales support (spare parts, keeping the manuals online, and so on). Now, you might say \u2018that looks fair \u2014 I\u2019m spending 10x as much on the guitar, and the materials and manufacturing are costing 10x as much each.\u2019 That\u2019s true. You might even say \u2018that\u2019s unfair, look at how much the dealer is making\u2019, though, you might also recognise that it\u2019s because of this that dealers can give serious discounts to customers they like. The thing is, $40 of material and $40 of manufacturing isn\u2019t enough to build a shed, let alone a fine musical instrument. The same amount of work goes into the basic 90% of the instrument shape and fittings. Even if the manufacturer is paying subsistence wages in a country with a low-cost-of-living, the $200 is not getting the attention it needs. Now, you aren\u2019t getting 10x as much attention in the manufacturing, because a $2,000 guitar is probably made in a country where workers are better paid (without necessarily being better skilled), but on a $2,000 guitar you should be getting a decent amount of attention. The same goes for the materials. For an electric guitar the body isn\u2019t especially important (really, it doesn\u2019t make that much difference), but the neck and fretboard have to be immaculate to give the low-action that electrics require. Then there\u2019s the pickups, the machine heads, the electronic components, the bridge hardware, and even un-obvious things like the strap pins and the frets. And the truss-rod, of course, which will determine whether your guitar lasts one year, or one hundred years. The reason that a $200 guitar has $40 spent on its materials is that this is the minimum amount that a manufacturer can spend and still have beginners (or their parents) buy them. It used to be the minimum quality that guitar shops would stock, but on-line has taken that down further. When everything is pared to the minimum, the result is barely playable. Then there\u2019s shipping. Why does it cost $120 to ship an expensive guitar? Part of that is the expensive guitar arrives in a hard-case, protected in a cardboard box, protected in a bigger box, and so on. The $200 guitar arrives rattling around in a cardboard box that probably does not fit it at all well. True, the manufacturer is making more \u2014 but not 10x as much. Profits are to be had at the bottom of any industry, because economies of scale can play a much larger part. The dealer is not making $40 on a cheap guitar, or $440 on an expensive guitar. The dealer has to pay staff, rent, lighting, insurance, and still have enough to make it worth running the business. A dealer who likes you might discount all of their profit for a quick sale, on the grounds that you will be a repeat customer and will probably bring other customers. But they won\u2019t do it for everyone, or for every guitar. Then you have three lines in the $2,000 guitar which aren\u2019t there for the $200. Marketing, Research, and Support. Marketing is why some brands are highly respected, and others basically unknown. Every penny you contribute to marketing contributes to the resale value of your guitar. Then there\u2019s research. The $200 guitar is not full of innovative features. It will be the cheapest-to-make copy that doesn\u2019t instantly provoke a lawsuit. Every five years, high-end guitars are manufactured better, because high-end manufacturers are working on improvements. And don\u2019t forget support. You can get exact parts for long-discontinued $2,000 guitars. You won\u2019t be able to get parts for the $200 guitars that are still being sold.  Now, all these numbers are notional. They will be different for every process. Some manufacturers can make a $4000 quality guitar and sell it for $2000. Some may be selling a $1000 guitar for the same price. The point is, though, that there\u2019s a sweet spot where you\u2019ve spent enough to have a guitar that functions correctly. Above that point, you may be paying for bling, or you may be paying for expensive marketing, or you may be paying for innovation, manufacturing precision and near-perfected design. Or all three. Or just more profit. That\u2019s why it\u2019s usually the case that a very cheap guitar isn\u2019t going to be an economic choice, but you need to try out a lot of guitars to find one which is right for you, affordable, and has that particular magic which blends with your style and genre.  May the strings always bend in your favour!  To clarify in case of misunderstanding. All the figures above are notional figures. Every manufacturer will work them in different proportions. But every product, whether it be vehicle suspension, yoghurt or guitars, has to cope with the same set of costs: ShippingManufacturing workMaterialsDealer discountResearchMarketingSupportProfit.This, of course, is excluding sales-tax (where applicable). Manufacturers from time to time get the figures wrong, and can end up selling at a loss while imagining they are selling at a profit. The way that Research, Marketing, Support and Shipping are calculated can also make a major difference. Generally speaking, a top brand gets a \u2018brand premium\u2019 in terms of what their Manufacturers Recommended Selling Price is, although, often, this translates into dealers taking less of a discount because, ultimately, if consumers don\u2019t buy them, the dealer is making nothing on them.

            "answer_text": "As a guitar player who started on an old Squier (cheap guitar) for the first years and now play on a luthier custom made model, I may have an answer for you. The first thing I need to tell you is that watching comparison videos on YouTube won\u2019t give you an accurate vision of the differences between the cheap and expansive models. You will watch a specific guy with a specific playing style playing on a specific amp, recorded by a specific device, and you won\u2019t even touch the guitar. So you can\u2019t possibly know how it even feels to have the guitar in your hands. I\u2019ve tried a lot of guitars, cheap and very expansive, and it may be true that some inexpansive guitars may be quite good and some very expansive guitars may be overrated. But keep in mind that judging the sound and the playability of a guitar is a very subjective thing. So what are the common differences between a 200$ guitar and a 2000+$ guitar ? -The quality of the wood: Inexpensive guitar are made of low quality wood (agathis , nato, sipo, poplar, basswood), that are not well dried and are plain sawn, which mean that the wood will be less stable with time and will transmit the vibration less well. A good quality guitar will be made of high quality wood (hard maple, mahogany, ebony, etc\u2026), well dried, and quarter sawn for a perfect stability. -The components on the guitar: I remember that using the tremolo bar on my old Squier was a nightmare! Just one use and the guitar was completely out of tune. The tuning machines were low quality as well and wouldn\u2019t hold the strings in tune. And the pickups and electronic were also poor and had a weak and nosy sound. A good quality guitar will use a high quality tremolo such as Wilkinson or Original Floyd Rose, Die cast tuning machines, and good pickups with high grade magnets and wire (Dimarzio, Seymour Duncan for example, or Bare Knuckle or Dominger for highest quality). The sound will be deeper, organic, more accurate, and react more to the variations of playing. -The overall quality of construction: The low priced guitar are made in big factory by unskilled workers. On a low quality guitar, the finition of the guitar (bindings, sanding, varnish, alignement of the components) will mediocre and sometimes poor, which makes for a bad comfort when playing and less beautiful guitars. On a high quality guitar, everything will be done by experts and everything will be optimized for the best playing experience possible (such as low string action without buzz, good neck profile, frets finition, etc\u2026), and of course a more beautiful guitar. That\u2019s why you NEED to hold the guitar in your hands to make your own opinion. It\u2019s like driving a Lada or a Ferrari. One last thing: Yes, there ARE a lot of differences between a low quality guitar and a high quality one, but don\u2019t forget that the guitarist is more important than the guitar he plays. You can give a good guitarist a 200$ guitar and he will always be able to play something that sound good out of it, but give a 2000$ to a beginner/intermediate guitarist and it will still sound like an amateur is playing :) ",
