            "answer_text": "Dm13 \u2261 1-\u266d3-(5)-\u266d7-(9)-(11)-13 = D-F-(A)-C-(E)-(G)-B. In guitar theory, notes in parentheses are optional. Sticking to guitar theory, which ignores inversions for chord-driven guitarist standardization purposes, an example finger position is X-X-0-5-6-7 = \u25cf-\u25cf-D-C-F-B. Assuming you\u2019re focusing on the diatonic scale, the underlying scale can only be C major, unless employing temporary accidentals in one or more measures. That said, guitar theorists commonly ignore changes to the structure of the underlying scale when building & naming chords, particularly extended & altered chords. For example, the underlying scale might be G major, even though our Dm13 chord requires an F rather than F\u266f. The parent scale, the one whose keynote double-dips as the chord\u2019s root, is D major, not D minor. Your confusion about where B comes from is somewhat common among undergraduate students of music theory. Specifically, all chords, including minor, assume a major scale as its parent. So while the quality of the chord itself is minor, its parent scale is major. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two, non-competing, answers to this question. The first and simplest is that there are more than one type of minor scale. The Melodic Minor scale does indeed include a full 6th (which an octave higher is a 13th), and in the case of D melodic minor is a natural B. The second answer is less direct but equally important and useful: remember, every scale is associated with a series of chords, so, a D minor chord does not have to imply a D minor scale. In this case, for example, the D minor chord could be the 2nd degree chord in the C Major scale. The \u201cscale\u201d associated with that chord is the D Dorian, which is the second mode of the C Major scale. Simply put, it\u2019s The C Major scale starting on the D note. Well, the C Major scale includes a natural B, so a D minor 13th chord is \u201cin scale\u201d. This second answer is where you should start, because the designation \u201c13\u201d implies there is also a b7, in this case a natural C. ",
