            "answer_text": "before i begin talking about this topic, this answer will be heavy with sm artists because they are the best vocalists and no matter how much biased we all are we can\u2019t deny this. i will be talking about a lot of groups, but i will be focusing more on the members. First of all snsd one of the best vocalist groups if not the best taeyeon mainly known as the main vocalist can belt really well and has a decent support range even though she can\u2019t produce resonance really well in the high register but she does extremely well in the middle one, now tiffany, she may push her voice to its limits which can damage it if she isn\u2019t well trained, but we can see that her high register is very \u201cclean\u201d which shows her good support and good use of range, there are much more members i wanna talk about because the thing with sm groups is that you won\u2019t find any member who doesn\u2019t match the vocal image of the group, and they all are close in range, so to the next group.Superjunior, i\u2019ll begin with kyuhyun, there\u2019s no vibrato technique such as his, adding that to his breath control and his belting technique he\u2019s the perfect vocalist with a wide range and good resonance, i\u2019ve heard him singing a segment while riding the taxi in exciting India (a show he participated in with SHINee Minho, CNBLUE jonghyun, Infinite sunggyu, and EXO suho). However, the only issue which can be found even though it\u2019s not an issue is his pronounciation which can muffle the notes sometimes, and it\u2019s present in most of the 2nd generation boygroups\u2019 vocalists it was more of a style used than an inconvenient, i\u2019ll move next to ryeowook he has more agility in his voice than kyuhyun and almost never strain8: also has good support.Sistar, but i\u2019ll be only talking about hyolyn she is one of the best female kpop vocalists, she has a surprisingly amazing lower register for a soprano and produces very good resonance she has a light voice and can execute good runs, there are really few times in which you won\u2019t enjoy her voice.EXO, even if i just wanna talk bout the vocal line, i\u2019ll have to add some other members, but let us begin with chen who is arguably the best singer of the third generation due to many points of force and very few points of improvement, chen has one of the most developped voices in kpop people tend to notice his high notes, because of his incredible belting technique but his middle register is more enjoyable and it shows in his solo works even though he has a very impressive high support range for a male singer, baekhyun has also a lot to show through his middle and low range but since he has a very good high register too and they have to explore for the group\u2019s chemistry sake that\u2019s why the middle and low ones rae barely used in exo songs, d.o is good belter too and is appreciated for his r&b style he has a really good tone but is affrad to explore his high register which leaves to execute the high note in falsettos rather than head, then i\u2019ll be moving to suho whose falsettos i think are the best among exo members, he has a very gentle tone, he also has a clean head voice and his high register is well explored, lay is mainly known for his consistent head voice, lay is mainly a dancer but he trained hard in vocals and it shows through his latest songs, he used to not execute runs nor support his head voice but now he can and transitions from falsetto to head in avery good manner. I\u2019ll be adding the rapper too chanyeol who has impressive technics that a rapper doesn\u2019t have to aquire.EXID, i\u2019ll be talking about solji and hyelin and hani, solji who is known to be exid\u2019s former vocal trainer has little to no flaws concerning her technique even though he range is a bit restricted she has good placement she is an all rounded vocalist, now hyelin she is actually my favorite vocalist due to her well trained low and high registers, besides her clear tone makes it very enjoyable to listen to her, and most importantly she has very good support, next i\u2019ll be moving to hani, hani may not be the strongest vocalist, but she is surely very stylistic and this is what makes her shine in exid, she has a very gentle and sudective tone and has good breath control, her lower register is well developedRedvelvet, again sm artists, wendy is known to be one of the most appreciated kpop vocalists, she has the widest range among female idols and she can hit Eb7, there aren\u2019t many vocalists who can reach the 7th octave (irene did in RBB hitting D7 which is again very impressive) she can support all of her registers really well, and can execute many technics like runs, belting, vibrato etc, now seulgi is also known for her tone, her range is average and she can support it well, very smooth transitions, exceptionally good head voice and good runs, joy one of the cutest voices not the stongest one out there but can support fairly well her head voice executes good vibratos too and is more stylistic than her members.Dreamcatcher, i have to add this group because it is one of my favorite vocalist groups out there, most of the girls have good technics which let them one of the best vocalists, let\u2019s begin with the main vocalist siyeon, she is one of the sopranos who have expended lower register and she has one of the most consistent and strong voices when singing in her middle register, her head voice is well trained in the higher register and sings comfortably in her chest voice within her lower register strong belting technique which fits perfectly with dreamcatcher\u2019s rock songs, then yoohyeon who can pass for the main vocalist in many girlgroups has almost the same exquisite technics as siyeon but with less stamina, then we have gahyeon, handong, suA, and jiU who all have different positions in the group but can all pass for lead vocalists.Then lastly i\u2019ll have to mention another group Loona, especially chuu who has one of the prettiest and most consistent head voices among idols of the 4th generation, then Yves who has a very good tone and consistent voice while performing along with good breath control, and lastly jinsoul who has a very strong hed and can belt really well and Kim lip who has a very gentle and enjoyable voice and falsettos.wooh that was it, this is pretty long tbh. Btw this was written following the order of who debuted first to last. ",

            "answer_text": "SM groups hands down. Love them or hate them, no one can ever deny that SM definitely KNOWS what they're doing when it comes to vocal prowess, and it's not just me saying it, any expert will tell you that Taeyeon, Tiffany, Wendy, Jonghyun, D.O., Chen and Baekhyun are the best vocalists of their respective generations. My ranking will be this: Girls Generation. Their vocal prowess is legendary. Both fans and haters would always acknowledge that they had PIPES.EXO. Even their non-main vocalists could swipe the floor with other groups\u2019 main vocalists. Have you heard Xiumin sing? Well, he's not even in the vocal line.TVXQ. Legend says Xiumin's jaw is still on the floor after that 2018 MBC Music festival performance.SHINEe. Having a good voice AND the technique to keep it stable throughout gruelling choreography is not a skill easily found.Super Junior Legends don't need an explanation.MAMAMOO. I'm inclined to believe their vocal talent is what saved them from being permanently cancelled in the West after their racist scandals.Red Velvet. Not all of them are great in fact, I wouldn't even consider Irene and Yeri good but Wendy and Seulgi alone could carry the weight of a 12-member group.G-friend. Yuju is a legend. The other vocalists are overrated imo but they're still good.NCT. Taeil. Enough said.Pentagon. Not much to say here, Hui's voice can step on me.TWICE. I know this one will be controversial because they have the fame of NOT be able to sing but I'll be damned if anyone says that my girl Jihyo is not one of the top three singers of this generation. Nayeon is super consistent and Jeongyeon's got incredible stability when singing live. I think that the rest of them would make decent singers if they gave them a lower range.Honorary mention: Luna of f(x). Being the most talented and yet the least popular member of your group must be devastating. ",

All the members of this group are definitely great singers. And not to mention that Kyuhyun's singing skills is DABEST! Lastly, I don\u2019t have to explain more on how this Legendaries existed in kpop industry for I am speechless. Its just a wowowow feels. \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04. Aww I miss this dorks :< Despite their silly and humorous way of entertaining others, they also have the capacity to impress the audience through their music. The musical instruments, along with their voice, had a great combination of emotional and pop electronic vibe, and their song sounded much better even without rap. And that\u2019s a FACT. \ud835\udc01\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udc00\ud835\udfd2. Their music often provides a remarkable positive melody. Idk if some of u can relate on how I feel, its just everytime I listen to their song. I feel sooOoo YOUNG AND ALIVE:> \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e. Each of the members' voices have different qualities and once they sing together its sounds like.. WOAAHHH HOW ON EARTH DID I GET ON HEAVEN EASILY?! call me exaggerated or whatsoever but they really possess an astounding music to the ears \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d. They actually relieve all my stress everytime I hear their song. The vocals are great and cute but overall it remains powerful. Their voice blended well with the musical instruments, and I find them very pleasing in my ears. I just cantttttt!! <3 \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc17\ud835\udc0e. Its just.. This boys really never failed to impress me. Until now, even though some members go parted ways , you can still feel their presence being complete towards their music. They certainly are capable of controlling high notes in a good and stable way. And everytime they try new things the result of their song becomes great. \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc01. I can feel a lot of emotion going on in their music. The harmony just brings a lot of vibes. I can feel the softness and comfort of their voice. And you'll see how emotional am I in making this statement hahah maybe because I got carried away because of them. LASTLY, ALL OF THEM HAD A POWERFUL VOICE AND A SOUND SO GOOD THAT CAUSE MYSELF A HARD TIME CHOOSING WHO\u2019S THE BEST?!!! <3 But currently i'm quite disappointed to see some kpop band underrated this year. Just like infinite, beast, btob and etc. It just shows that no matter how a kpop group, delivers a good song towards the audience. As time passed by, people like them can only be appreciated on the basis of their appearance, age and popularity. Tbh. Edited::: Btw I also wanna add Golden Child on my list. I was able to know them because of the ads that i\u2019ve seen recently on yt. Like gaaaad!! they are so good. Their vocals is really satisfying in my ears i just cant!!! And also, CLC, Onewe, Oneus , Redvelvet, Dreamcatcher, Loona, VIXX ,G-idle, MonstaX, LOVELYZ, Mamamoo, and Kard. If you're not familiar with some of these groups. Well, I suggest u to check out their MV\u2019s, coz in terms of vocals all of them nailed it. ",

            "answer_text": "I AM SHOCKED NOBODY HAS MENTIONED A.C.E. YET!!!! Seriously, folks, A.C.E. has some of the best vocals out there in K-Pop, but NOBODY IS AWARE OF THAT. I never see them in rankings like these and that is a problem. Before you disagree, please listen to this:  This is three of their members covering \u201cSomeone You Loved\u201d by Lewis Capaldi. Just LISTEN to their harmonies, their angelic and soulful voices and the emotions they convey. The definition of beauty, I'm telling you. FYI, A.C.E. is a group that officially has 2 main vocals, one lead vocal and two (sub-) vocalists. But don't let their positions fool you!! I dare say that if the members were in other groups, they would totally all be AT LEAST lead vocal, if not main vocal. Even the rappers. For proof, watch their beautiful \u201cYoungblood\u201d cover (all 5 of them together):  Yes, the 2 members on the left are (according to their official positions) both main performance, main/lead rappers and \u201cmere\" vocalists. Would you believe that from this amazing cover? So, now you might think, \u201cwell duh, their vocals are only good because they are not dancing at the same time like other idols\". In case you made this assumption, feel free to watch any of their live stages. These group doesn't even know the meaning of the term lip sync!!! To give you an example, this is their latest comeback stage:  And this is their comeback stage of their title track \u201cTake Me Higher\", which relies quite heavily on great vocals (I didn't want to put this here at first, cuz one of their members (one main vocal!) used to promote with UNB at that time):  Screw Mnet's usage of cameras. Doesn't do the difficult and exhausting choreo justice. Did I mention that A.C.E. are also some of the best dancers out there? Feel free to watch any of their countless dance covers or any of their performance videos for proof. They also have very unique and interesting choreo. But since this question is about vocals, I won't go too much into detail. So basically, what I'm saying is that A.C.E. even slays their vocals while dancing hardcore. This is so rare in K-Pop nowadays. Yes, I am aware that this answer is probably pretty biased since I have no clue about vocal technique and EXO has, according to most kpop fans and people who know what good vocal technique actually is, some of the best vocals in the industry. But after them, who is next? I think A.C.E. could come pretty close. I'd say that all of them are very very stable, and I think that people should agree that AT LEAST 2 of them have really distinctive and unique vocal tones. More than that, the choices they make on how to sing a their own song or a cover are often very interesting and surprising and convey a lot of emotion. And in my opinion, this is exactly what \u201cgood vocals\" should do. Also, it is very rare that each individual in a group is actually a skilled vocalist, which makes A.C.E. even more special in my opinion. So, probably my personal ranking for the top male groups' vocals is as follows (so far): #1 Exo #2 A.C.E. #3 NCT Honorable mentions coz I don't know too much about them to be honest, but they seem vocally really talented: Pentagon - don't get me started on dr bebe!!! Plan to stan ONF - watch any of their rtk performances for proof- amazing!!! Their music isn't rlly my type of thing tho. SF9 - have not checked out their live vocals yet. But their vocals on the MVs do sound very nice!! Also, I really don't know too much about 2nd generation groups, but I've heard that Shinee, VIXX, Super Junior (or just some of them), TVXQ and Infinite have/had very strong vocals, too. If you have become interested in A.C.E. by reading this answer, I'll leave you a few uninteresting, but impressive facts about them here (but this is just very little, coz it is a lot): Members Byeongkwan, Donghun and Sehyoon participated in YG's survival show Mixnine and placed 4th, 8th and 11th respectively - Byeongkwan and Donghun actually made the cut for the debut team, but since YG is shit, they didn't keep their promise and never debuted the group. At the same time, members Jun and Chan participated in the survival show the Unit, ranking at places 20 and 9 respectively. That way, Chan made the cut for the debut team and has promoted with UNB (the group that derived from the Unit) for one year until their disbandment. Talented kings indeed!Speaking of talent, there is literally no black hole in A.C.E.: all of them could actually be considered main dancers and main vocalists. Also, A.C.E. has 3! Triple! Threats! - since their initial 2 rappers left before debut, the remaining members had to fill their spots. And they do it so well!!! They switch the rapping between almost all of them, so we can listen to 3 of them rapping in their title tracks, while there are also videos/tracks with the other two rapping (and it's not even bad)They have no official visual, cause they're all visual members^^A.C.E. members used to train under JYP, YG, Jellyfish ent and CJ EN&M, but left these companies because they were told that their companies would not debut any boygroups in the near future (2 yrs later skz debut rip Byeongkwan and Chan). Instead, their former (female! this is rare) vocal coach and now CEO formed their company/label Beat Interactive for them so they could have at least a chance at debut (cos they are amazingly talented). I guess you don't know Beat Interactive, but you should know that they are actually a GOOD company that treats their idols well and doesn't impose a fake personality on them. The company even pranked them lmaoooSince their company was very small, they did busking with covers and later on (when they had one) their own debut song to raise enough money for their debut. They still do it now - if you are interested, you can find many many videos of them busking on yttheir CEO encourages them to read about and educate themselves on topics such as feminism and racism. A recent music video for their side track actually had a small part with cultural appropriation in it, but soon after fans told the company on twitter, they decided to take the video down and retake the scene differently.A.C.E. openly support LGBTQ and go against fashion standards for men in Korea, introducing e.g. crop tops and hot pants for men into Kpop (they did this at their debut and received a lot of hate for it as a consequence). They are proving that a more feminine style doesn't make them less manlyThey introduced the hardstyle genre into kpopThey were the first kpop act to ever perform in Ireland :DA.C.E are one of the most improved groups out there. If you compare their vocals and dancing from debut with their dancing and singing now, 3 years later, you can see a significant difference (tho they were never bad to begin with). And they are still doing their utmost to improve even moreOne of their member's stage name is literally Wow. It can be confusing sometimesThe members seriously care for each other. At least this is what I'm getting from pretty much any of their videos. They are pretty much being their chaotic and seriously hilarious selves all the timethey are spoiler kings. I will say no more. Look it up on yt if you are interested it is hilarioustheir b-sides are actually goodalso cover kings. I have heard a yt reactor say: If you want to do a cover, do it like A.C.E. - For proof, you can watch e.g. their dance cover of NCT's Kick it or their busking cover of BTS's Not Today (predebut), the vocal covers I've already linked or basically any other of their covers. Seriously. I'd recommend them all. But my special recommendation would be their recent cover stage of VIXX's On and On - even if you are not familiar with VIXX, watch this cover, it is very impressive. Especially if you read the comments under the video.they have lowkey shut down YGthey were specially invited to perform at the 2020 oscar afterparty after Parasite's winchicken is destiny. I'm sorry.they are just some of the most talented, wonderful and genuine people in the kpop industry. So check them out at least. They are wayyyyyy too underappreciated, tho they are now gaining some more fansSO GO NOW AND CHECK THEM OUT!!! They have sooo many covers uploaded on their yt channel, you could start with those. You could also check out their title tracks, which are all pretty different from each other with A.C.E. slaying in a multitude of genres. These are: CACTUS (debut), CALLIN, TAKE ME HIGHER, UNDER COVER and SAVAGE (latest track)if you are just here for the crack videos, I got you! I highly recommend \u201cA.C.E. vlives are chaotic\u201d by wowson universe, but quite honestly, A.C.E. are hilarious and/or adorable no matter where you put them.Well, at the end of this, I want to apologize for the shameless self-promo. But I have never seen anyone mentioning A.C.E. before here on Quora and thought that it was about time, considering their hard work. I am very sure lots of people would like them and the music they put out a lot, but many people just don't know about them. Keeping in mind that A.C.E. are considerably talented, I think it's a shame. So never mind meeee :D Sorry for any mistakes content-wise or language-wise. I might be wrong at some points and I'm not a native speaker. Have a wonderful day!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Mamamoo has a great vocal line and a pretty strong one at that. My favorite vocalist of them is Solar, but in my opinion, they\u2019re all very good. EXID (although not a big fan of their discography) must be acknowledged for their wonderful singers, especially Solji and Hyelin. Hani has a very interesting voice; she has kind of a jazz-y vibe and sometimes an airy, soulful voice. Then there\u2019s BtoB \u2014 very talented vocalists, all of them. EXO has well-trained vocalists such as DO (my favorite), Chen, Suho, and Baekhyun. In VIXX, there\u2019s Ken and Leo, with their charming vocals. In SEVENTEEN, there\u2019s a dedicated vocal unit (DK, Seungkwan, Jeonghan, Woozi, Joshua) as well as Seungcheol and Hoshi (different units but trained to become vocalists). Pentagon has a sweet vocal line comprising the majority of the members. I need not say much about the legendary SHINee \u2014 with talented singers like Onew, Taemin (and late Jonghyun). Dreamcatcher\u2019s Siyeon and Yooheyon are very good singers. Got7\u2019s Jaebum, Yongjae, and Jin-young seem to be appreciated for their singing (although I cannot entirely vouch for their live singing ability). Some K-pop singers have great voices but don\u2019t sound that great live. I usually don\u2019t judge someone\u2019s singing ability by their studio voice. Lives (especially fancams) can help \u2014to some extent\u2014 to get a better idea. Some fans tend to confuse screaming/screeching into the mic with belting; the latter is not suitable for everyone\u2019s singing voice and requires much training. Unfortunately, some singers have very nice voices but lack proper techniques. They tend to hit notes that are not within their range (and for reasons unbeknownst to me, some tend to equate hitting high notes with good singing). I have seen a couple of videos in which the singer goes through considerable strain to hit those high notes and their veins ready to pop any second, making it harrowing for both the singer and the listener to endure.

I don\u2019t mean to say these groups are better than Mamamoo, Super Junior, etc., I just didn\u2019t want to repeat groups. Lovelyz It\u2019s such a shame how people don\u2019t talk about their singing talent as much as other groups. Seriously amazing vocalists, their SubVocals could be main in quite a few groups and their mains are just\u2026 phenomenal.  9muses They disbanded, but I couldn\u2019t make this list without them. Their vocalists are so good and they have members with deep voices which is refreshing.  I.O.I. Another disbanded group but their vocals are still legendary. How could I not include them when they have Chungha, Sejeong, Yeonjung, who are all amazing vocalists, and that\u2019s not even a third of the lineup.  (I couldn\u2019t find a singing compilation of them but this shows their singing nicely.) GeeGu This group is filled with amazing vocalists but, sadly, they don\u2019t get recognition for that. I originally looked for this question because I wanted to give some GeeGu vocal appreciation so they\u2019re going to get multiple videos.      I seriously recommend you listen to all of these videos, their singing is heavenly.  I\u2019m sorry if I forgot any groups you had in mind, but these were all the groups I could think of~ K-bye \ud83d\udc9a ~Shadow ",

            "answer_text": "Onew is my favorite singer in kpop period. His voice at first sounds nice soft and clear, but he has an incredible range, with his low notes being supported, and high notes sounding heavenly. He probably has the best vocal technique out of any singer in kpop in my personal opinion. His breath control is just insane. Jonghyun as well has this Soulful RnB sound that\u2019s so smooth and really gets you into it. His voice is powerful as hell. Like if he is in a choir, your hearing him immediately. He truly had a near perfect voice. For newer groups Hui is amazing, and I think better than Jin-ho. And Chen, D. O and Baek are all equally incredible and play off each other amazingly. Also max from TVXQ has Hugh notes that will literally shatter your soul. And while Jungkook is the Main vocalist of BTS, V is obviously better. His breath control is absolutely incredible, and his range is great. He is one of the few distinct Baritones in kpop who can really support that low register, and give it soul. Also Key from Shinee is extremely slept on, but whatever. But overall Onew is the best in my current opinion, and if Jonghyun was around (RIP) he would be tied. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the best vocal lines in Kpop at the moment include NCT 127 - with Haechan, Doyoung, Jaehyun and the legendary Taeil that can hit them high notes in his sleep, they make a truely amazing vocal selection SHINee - Onew, Taemin and the late Jonghyun (Rest his beautiful soul) are easily one of the best vocal lines, not only are their voices like angels, but their stability when live is also insane, even Key has great vocals, I remember hearing \u201cGood Evening\u201d earlier this year and being stunned by his vocal ability. BTS - Jim, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook all have amazing vocal abilities, with some of their notable examples being their solo songs in the Love Yourself Series, they\u2019re very deserving for their success. Some notable female vocalist in girl groups include MAMAMOO - SolarRed Velvet - WendySISTAR - HyorinSNSD - TaeyeonOverall My all time favourite vocal line has to be SHINee due to their amazing range and stability in their voices.

Changsub, Sungjae,Hyunsik, and Eunkwang are probably some of the best vocalists in kpop due to their amazing stability,emotion and raw power in their voices and also , they all can hit high notes and sing without damaging their voice. The other members as well can sing very well too! I would say the same for Exo too regarding Baekhyun, D.O and Chen. all of the other members are extremely good too and they have no faulty singer. Finally, I would also mention Shinee. Need I explain but seriously, Jonghyun and Onew are again one of the best vocalists to hit kpop. ONEW CAN HOLD A NOTE FOR 40 SECONDS YEESH!! ",

BTOB Newer fans of Koop may not know them, since they are from a smaller company, but their vocalists are no joke. Their voices compliment eachothers very nicely, and I really love the group's music style.  EXO Though they have many members, and their line distribution doesn't showcase certain members' true poetential, I can tell that they have a well trained and beautiful voice.  ",

I\u2019m not saying this just because i stan them, i truly felt like they are one of the best if not the best vocals. I also think btob has very solid vocals along with mamamoo, and Girls Generation.

            "answer_text": "Nam woo-hyun and kim sung-kyu. Woohyun shows a very determined passion for singing, however he may not be exposed to as much vocal technique as he should. His breathing and jaw tension seem to be recurring issues that although have improved, are such implemented habits that perhaps nobody has told him not to do. He has shown good improvement over the years and could potentially show much more improvement in the future when given the right tools to work with. He has an certain degree of understanding of music and dynamics, where he knows how to place his voice to create different breathy approaches, fuller sounds or lighter brighter sounds when singing. He has the potential to show much more than he\u2019s shown so far, with much more attention to detail, breathing and perhaps developing and using his voice to fullest to a create a one sounding connected instrument throughout his registers. Sunggyu\u2019s voice is probably the most agile amongst Infinite members. When it comes to vocal runs and ornamentations, Sunggyu seems to be the only one with interest in that area of his voice, truly allowing for certain developments in his voice and in agility over time. Back in the day when Infinite performed \u201cWith You\u201d by Chris Brown, his vocal runs lacked note separation and true clarity of tone, sounding messy and unbalanced however so overtime he\u2019s shown that he\u2019s been working on his vocal runs, most notably when he sang \u201cAs Long As You Love Me\u201d by Justin Bieber, where he accurately hits added run notes with good separation and yet connected smoothly in a line. The speed of his runs is still quite slow, showing that he\u2019s taken time to improve his accuracy but still needs to further develop the true agility of his voice to be classified as a vocalist with an actually agile voice.

Their vocal line is absolutely no joke and the trio main vocalists can beat any other vocal trio out there. I am absolutely astonished by their technique, wide range, high notes, etc. etc. They all have color as well. Without a doubt, EXO has the best vocals in the KPOP Industry. They are seriously unmatched. Here\u2019s the Main Vocal Trio consisting of: Chen  D.O  and Baekhyun:  Here are the other vocalists in EXO, consisting of: Suho  Xiumin :  Their rappers also sing a lot (Kai and Chanyeol mostly).

And exo adapts to any kind of genre. Do i need to say anything? Oh and they have a well rounded vocalist which is chen, it\u2019s pretty rear to see well rounded vocalist in 3rd gen compared to 2nd gen. Well rounded vocalist that i know are kyuhyun, jonghyun, taeyon, chen, onew, wendy, etc. Even though btob only has 1 main vocalist their group is also known for having good vocals and like exo their rappers can also sing. Exo and btob are known for their vocals and i believe these 2 groups leads the vocals for 3rd gen. I\u2019ve been waiting for a collab between them :( Oh and i also forgot nct, they also have 3 main vocalist :D ",
