            "answer_text": "Question: \u201cDid Freddie Mercury know he had AIDS when Queen recorded \"Who Wants to Live Forever\"?\u201d Answer: Thank you for the A2A: According to a couple of his very close, personal, friends he had first been tested with the, then, new HTLV-III/LAV ELISSA tests in 1985, and the results came back positive. However, the Dr then told him that the tests were new and were the first generation of the tests ever released - they were still experimental essentially - and that it had since been discovered that they had actually given false positives. They also weren\u2019t designed to test if patients had \u2018AIDS\u2019, they were designed to test the blood supply in hospitals for the virus. This lead to them discovering that when used to test for the virus in people they could in fact give false positives.  Initially this was taken by the medical people to be a \u2018rare\u2019 thing, however as more and more people were tested with them the Dr\u2019s behind the tests, and the Dr\u2019s doing the testing realized that the tests were in fact highly flawed, and false positives were not rare, they were actually very common. In fact those first generation tests had an approximate 50% chance of giving a false positive. As a result while the next generation of tests were developed Dr\u2019s testing people were advised to do multiple tests, and be very careful with how the tests were handled, stored and conducted.  For example, being pregnant could result in a false positive, certain illnesses, disease etc could lead to false positives, even just feeling run down and having a low immune system at the time of being tested could result in a false positive. They were also not able to detect if someone was recently infected(ie - someone that was tested in the first 3\u20134 months** of infection would come back as negative) **This \u2018window\u2019 was variable, and depended on several factors, but it was widely accepted that the tests couldn\u2019t detect the virus until it had been in the body for at least 12 weeks, and in some cases longer. It was said at the time, and even in later years - by several people - that simply shaking, or putting the test down too hard could turn a negative into a positive - how true that is I don\u2019t know, but it is something that several people have stated; although it may have been in jest at how many things could result in false positives, and wasn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously. But I digress. The Dr was said to have told Freddie that the tests had a roughly 50% chance of being wrong, so he wanted Freddie to have a whole batch of tests run, and then they would look at the results as a whole (e.g- The patient would have 10 tests taken over a year or so, and if they are all positive(or most of them are) then you\u2019re more than likely positive and they will monitor you for known symptoms etc while you try and live a healthier lifestyle. Basically the more tests you have taken, and over the longer period of time the more \u2018accurate\u2019 their educated \u2018guess\u2019 would be essentially.) Freddie was said to be not amused at this, and had been worrying a lot while waiting for the results to come in, and broke down when told the test was positive, only then to become furious when the Dr went on to say that the results \u2018might\u2019 be wrong, so not to worry as they needed to do an entire batch of the tests just to be sure. He\u2019s said to have told the Dr that he felt fine, and that he wasn\u2019t going to go through the hell of having anymore of these tests when they had such a high chance of being wrong, and that he\u2019d get another test done when there was a new, better, and far more accurate test available. Freddie had apparently been talked into taking this test by someone he was very close because of the fact that he\u2019d recently been told that one of his old friends from New York had died from AIDS, and that a couple of other friends of his from the US had been diagnosed with AIDS. It\u2019s \u2018after\u2019 he was said to have had this test that he very abruptly left Germany, without saying goodbye to anyone - not even Barbara who he was living with at the time, nor his German lover. He simply upped and left without a word, moved back to the UK and settled down with Jim Hutton, leaving his old partying lifestyle behind. By 1986 he was certainly worried he might not be well. He made several comments to people that in retrospect people have been taken to mean that he either knew, or at the very least highly suspected he was - or could be - sick.  The magic tour was also the last time he said he would tour because he couldn\u2019t do it anymore - the band thought he was joking. But he had noticed that he hadn\u2019t got the energy that he used to have. He wasn\u2019t officially diagnosed with AIDS until May 1987, and according to the story he kept it to a very small number of people for quite some time while he processed it all. So did he \u2018know\u2019 - as in with medical verification - that he was sick when the song was written ? Maybe, maybe not. It really depends on who\u2019s story you believe; whether the official story is the actual truth, or whether that too was partly, or entirely a lie, and whether the stories that some of his close friends have said is true or not.  After all, when the story first ran in the paper that he\u2019d been tested it was due to a \u2018so called\u2019 friend leaking stories to the media for money. Freddie, and the bands manager get out in front of it and said it was the sensible thing to do given the climate of the times etc, and that it was simply for peace of mind, and not because he was worried etc. Back to the song. The band have said that songs often had \u2018nods\u2019 and \u2018winks\u2019 to other things, and double meanings in certain lyrics. Like Rogers song to his children also contained a \u2018nod\u2019 to Freddie. He was private, and didn\u2019t want to talk about his personal life, but at the same time they were all very close and working together in the studio a lot. So it would be hard \u2018not\u2019 to notice changes in their friend, and it would be hard not to worry about him when AIDS was all over the news, and front pages of the papers etc So, in my opinion, it\u2019s highly possible that the lyrics were either consciously, or sub-consciously, influenced by their friendship, and what was happening around them - e.g:- drawing inspiration from what they saw in the media and worrying about Freddie. Not to mention if Freddie himself had any input into the song, and changed things around - as he often did - then it\u2019s also possible that he too may have drawn from the things around him, and his worries. TLDNR: It\u2019s hard to say with 100% certainty that he \u2018knew\u2019. But that he worried he had, or suspected he might be sick? Certainly. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Dave Setchell \u2019s response for the most part. I will add that Freddie was already having multiple seizures in early 1985 and had an EXTREME case of oral thrush in June of 1985 and was apparently unresolved in July \u201985 as his doctor advised that Freddie not participate in Live Aid. I'm sure doctors had told him many times to let his voice rest due to chronic issues with vocal polyps\u2026however that the doctor was specific about \u201dLive Aid\u201d it leads me to believe he was having uniquely serious problems with his throat. Especially since he already had two months vocal rest as the last concert date before the July 13 Live Aid show\u2026 WAS May 15. If it was just vocal nodules, he would be easily been recovered enough in 8 weeks. That the doctor was STILL advising he not do the show, there was something more serious going on, IMO. Friends say that Freddie \u201dsuddenly\u201d disappeared from Munich in mid to late 1985. Mary Austin said Freddie \u201dknew\u201d during the \u201dMagic Tour\u201d which started June 1986. So, if I had to make a bet, whether he was officially \u201ddiagnosed\u201d in 1985, or if he just \u201dknew\u201d something was seriously wrong\u2026 I think he had at least SOME idea he was sick during \u201dWho Wants to Live Forever\u201d.

            "answer_text": "There is no way of knowing for sure what Freddie\u2019s private thoughts were when he wrote the song. No one but Freddie can tell us, and he is no longer around. It\u2019s important to remember that \u201cWho Wants to Live Forever\u201d was written for the movie The Highlander, which has themes related to immortality. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to assume the song was simply written for a film about immortality. At the same time, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that HIV/AIDS and his own mortality was at the very least at the back of his mind. I will never understand what it was like for a gay man in the 1980s. I can imagine the AIDS crisis was a nightmare. I wasn\u2019t around at the time, but can imagine HIV/AIDS was gaining widespread coverage in the media, and ingrained itself in the public\u2019s conscious. Maybe he did write the song on commission for the film, but maybe it\u2019s message had a strong, private meaning to him. Who knows? Edit: Freddie Mercury didn\u2019t write the song, Brian May did. I guess the answer is no, than! ",

            "answer_text": "The song was written by Brian May for the soundtrack of the movie highlander. He wrote it in the backseat of the car after seeing the movie scene it was meant for. It is completely unrelated to the life and experiences of Freddie Mercury. No one can deny that Freddie's voice \u201cmade\u201d the song though. On the album recording May sings along with Mercury, but in live versions Freddie sang the song and just took it to another level. It brings me to tears when I listen to it, because Freddie gives the song so much meaning and feeling. It's one of my ultimate favorite songs ever. And no, Mercury only found out in 1987 that he was diagnosed with aids. However I do think he knew he wouldn't live long, not after seeing so many of his friends succumb to the illness.

            "answer_text": "Good answer from Neil Anderson. It\u2019s worth remembering that Brian May wrote this for the soundtrack to the movie Highlander. The lyrics, while being general, are very much inspired by the themes in the film and I don\u2019t think Brian May would regard them as \u2018personal\u2019, much less Freddie. What I find more interesting is the writing and performance of a song like Was It All Worth It. The band would have been aware that Freddie was dying at this point. When this song was recorded they would have known that it was possible that The Miracle would be their last album and they placed it as the last song in the album. The same goes of course for The Show Must Go On (Brian and Freddie together), which I think is even more powerful and poignant. ",

Up until November 23, 1991, Mercury denied rumours of being HIV positive and was stalked by photographers and paparazzi who pointed out his appearance and absence at performances. On November 24, 1991, 24 hours after his announcement to the world, Mercury died at the age of 45. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS. So, we\u2019ll never know if Freddie was aware at that time whether he was already ill or not. ",
