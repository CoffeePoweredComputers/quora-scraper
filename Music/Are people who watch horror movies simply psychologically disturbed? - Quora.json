            "answer_text": "Not in the least or maybe I should say not any more than other person who enjoys musicals, war films, drama, comedy, etc. Why would you even ask that question? But to answer it, humans have enjoyed horror tales going back to the ancient Greeks and Romans and probably back to when we were huddled around a campfire trying to fend off saber tooth tigers. The horror film is just an extension of the horror tales, plays and books that humans have enjoyed forever. The need to be frightened and entertained by horror films is the same basic desire which drives some to ride roller coasters or go para gliding. Nothing more and nothing less. ",

I had a little family business, one son. Ah and love Heavy Metal. Why always the people got that worst impression? Why I like horror? Mostly for the mythology behind\u2026. ",
