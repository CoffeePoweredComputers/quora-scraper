            "answer_text": "OK. Please listen carefully: You cannot sing with your diaphragm. It is a physical impossibility. All vocal sounds are generated in your larynx which happen to be in your throat. The only function of the diaphragm is to regulate air flow from the lungs. That\u2019s it. Now about the moving Adam\u2019s apple. It\u2019s supposed to do that. As you sing higher pitches, the larynx will rise in the vocal tract and slide downward as you produce low pitches. It\u2019s just the way your voice works. I\u2019m sorry to sound so abrupt, but this type of question keeps appearing. It is astounding the amount of misinformation about the process of vocalization that exists. ",
