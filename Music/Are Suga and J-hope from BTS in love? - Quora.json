            "answer_text": "Well as you should know a few things, jhope and suga actually ship themselves together because they understand each other very well. Jhope brings out the best Suga when he is down and he frankly isn't really scared to love Suga. Their ship name is Sope and they made a song for their ship. I don't believe they are dating but I sure do know that these two are a perfect match and Suga really is in love Jhope. In fact, Sope is a worldwide ship that started really because of their song. And they aren't hinting anything, they are being straightforward that they may really be in love with each other. Welp I hope I answered your question. ",

Jokes aside, I understand Yoonseok is a well known ship in the fandom and how it's clearly obvious those two have great chemistry together. But I wouldn't go so far to say they were \u201cin love\u201d with each other, that's too much. First of all, that's assuming. Unless you personally know those two are in love, I find it rude to see that there are people that have the audacity to assume such things. Sure, they know each other quite well. Because they're group mates and good friends, they're know each other for practically a decade now. So do all of the other members, that's why they have such an easy going friendship with each other. Unless anything is confirmed, I'd like to believe that all of them have platonic relationships with each other. If they come out and reveal they're dating each other, I'll always support them. But for now, Yoonseok seems like a platonic friendship to me. Those two have great chemistry - crackhead energy is clearly obvious hahaha ",

Korean has this thing called Fan service, it is called shipping. Well shipping is done by fans that think so and do look cute together. This is fantasy dating, which is a term I came up with to describe these type of relationship to outsiders. Fantasy dating is fake not real, it is what the fans want to see hence the name fantasy dating. Suga J-Hope are friends brothers roommates, or business partners. So nothing going on to see. ",

Jhope liking men seems far shot to me..my baby is just so super sexy swaggalicious. They do love each other and are bonded through this and other experiences but bromanced not romanced. ",

We, as shippers, just tend to overanalize things, but after all, we only see about them what they want to show. Just ship for the thrill of the fun and creative artwork that comes along the way!  ",

All the members are very close. They are arguably best friends. Once you spend 7 years with someone, you would probably become very good friends with them. They are just friends. ",
