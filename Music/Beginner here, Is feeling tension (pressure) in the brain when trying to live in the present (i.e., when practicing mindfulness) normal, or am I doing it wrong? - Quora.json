            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a story about some western visitors at a Japanese Zen temple. They asked the abbot all sorts of questions about meditation, and he gave very full and detailed answers. Eventually, somebody asked, \u201cis effort required?\u201d He said only: \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult question.\u201d  It\u2019s similar with mindfulness practice. You\u2019re not asked to cause yourself any stress and tension, but many beginners will find it takes a bit of effort to allow it to become effortless.. It\u2019s called Mindfulness Practice for a reason! When you\u2019re learning a new skill, you don\u2019t get it right every time. Don\u2019t worry about that! You won\u2019t be present all the time - that\u2019s normal. It\u2019s expected. The practise is simply to bring yourself gently back to the the present once you notice your mind is wandering. It might help to think of mindful, relaxed presence as your natural state. The practice is to stop doing the things that take you away from presence, whenever you notice them. You don\u2019t need to stand guard over yourself or monitor yourself rigidly. Just set an intention to be present, and gently remind yourself to return to presence when you notice you have become distracted. Beginners sometimes picture a \u201cboss\u201d part of their mind keeping a close eye on an unruly \u201cprisoner\u201d mind \u2026 but that will make you very tense and drive you crazy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having thoughts or memories or daydreams - you\u2019ve just decided to try something else for a little while.  If you have a day when you find yourself distracted all the time, and you bring yourself back to the present a thousand times? Fabulous! That\u2019s a great workout! It will gradually make it easier for you to stay present and relaxed. Be gentle with yourselfLet goIt\u2019s not a raceEveryone gets distracted. It\u2019s OKTreat your mind like a cute infant or a puppy dog learning to stay in one place. Just gently and kindly remind it to return when it wanders off.Your responsibility in Mindfulness is simply to respond to distraction - not to prevent it from happening. As long as you are alive, your brain will secrete distracting thoughts in the same way your pancreas secretes insulin. Gradually, you\u2019ll learn not to be controlled by them.  And while you\u2019re practising, when you find yourself being frustrated with your distracted mind - just notice the frustrated feeling. Over time, gradually, gently, you\u2019ll develop the ability to be mindful for longer: without tension and without forcing and without frustration. ",

Experience is feedback presented by you to you. It\u2019s purpose: it shows you what\u2019s next. Without it, without experience, how would you know where you are relative to where you started? Introducing the belief contained in the word \u201cwrong\u201d and the negative feeling you may feel having judged your practice, are both also feedback. A good rule of thumb to post on your mental refrigerator is: if it feels good it is good. If it doesn\u2019t feel good, that\u2019s good too! Take the feedback and adjust. Physical manifestations of discomfort can mean a lot of things. It might help turning your attention to that pressure and nonjudgmentally be with it. After all, you\u2019re practicing being in the present/mindfulness and tension is part of your now, so what better thing to put attention on to focus you in your now/be present? You may discover too what you\u2019re calling \u201ctension\u201d turns to something else under your dispassionate internal gaze. Finally, relax. You\u2019re eternal. You have all of eternity to bring greater awareness to the now. There\u2019s no rush. You never get it wrong. So enjoy the process on your way to greater expansion/awareness. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe ",

            "answer_text": "If you are feeling tension when you try to live in the present, you are doing it wrong. The right way to practice Mindfulness is: First join a retreat with an experienced teacher for at least 10 days or 2 weeksYou shall learn to do sitting meditation and walking meditationWalking meditation is to bring the Mindfulness from sitting to all aspects of life, like eating, cooking, driving, studying and walkingYou cannot practice Mindfulness from just reading some materials, especially those that is written in the west and then try to enforce it into your life. Until you can join a retreat, you can now start to notice how often you watch your breath or your thoughts or your feelings and sensations in your body, especially in your free time. The more you do this, the better. If your mind wanders, i.e. thinking, chattering, etc\u2026, gently bring it back to watch your breath, thoughts or feelings from moment to moment without joining in the mental chit chat. Don\u2019t try, just remind yourself to do this. You can read more books of Zon-Kabat Zinn on the subject. Wish you good practice ",

Your brain will work much harder the more you train yourself in mindfulness and that can create headache like effects but keep going its a good sign. When I pull all day mediation sessions sometimes my head throbs to the point of bursting and its difficult for me to even turn my head to the left or right\u2026 this is a side effect of \u201cmachine consciousness\u201d and when those gears start turning you bring the pain lol ",

To answer your question a little bit of tension is good but when it gets out of control it can cause a mental strain.. Your brain is like a muscle, you train it then it becomes stronger then before.( Remember this) You wanna try but not try to hard.. Like learning to box you just simply go with the motions but don't think too hard about it.. Trust me if you do it like this then it will work. Or you can always ask your higher mind this question and it will give you an easy to understand answer. ",

Of course, continuity of awareness of present is good, but it takes time, and with practice and patience, it gets better. Good luck. ",
