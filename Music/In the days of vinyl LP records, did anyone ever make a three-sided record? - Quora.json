            "answer_text": "A three-sided record is physically impossible. I presume you mean a double album with audio on only three sides? Joe Jackson released a three-sided vinyl record in 1986. \u2018Big World\u2019 was a double album, but there was only music on Side One, Side Two, and Side Three. Side Four was blank, or \u2018flat\u2019 (I think that was the terminology for such records). It was his first album to be released in compact disc format. He knew he didn\u2019t have to conform to the regular running time of a double vinyl album, so he only recorded enough music for three sides. I don\u2019t own the vinyl version, but apparently the label states on Side Four: \u201cThere is no music on this side.\u201d It does have a groove, and if you put the stylus in it, the stylus quickly moves to the end of the groove. Jackson is quoted as saying that the album doesn\u2019t have a missing side - you get an extra side! ",

            "answer_text": "I remember a couple of oddities like that. Johnny Winter\u2019s 1969 release \u201cSecond Winter\u201d was a two-LP set with the fourth side blank. Monty Python\u2019s 1973 \u201cMatching Tie and Handkerchief\u201d had for a limited time a \u201cthird side\u201d contained within the grooves. On a related note\u2026. A group called Sand had a unique two-LP issue for their 1973 release: one record had \u201cSide 1\u201d the second record had \u201cSide 2\u201d and the flip sides were blank. Most phonographs had a tall spindle so one could stack 45s or LPs and enjoy uninterrupted listening, as much as possible. The intention behind the design of the Sand album was one would stack both records and listen without having to flip sides. ",
