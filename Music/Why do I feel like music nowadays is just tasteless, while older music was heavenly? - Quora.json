            "answer_text": "There is no simple answer to this dilemma. It is the mentality of most of the adults now that songs of bygone era stuck with us longer. But this is mainly due to the fact that those songs have been introduced to us since our most impressionable age. We grow up listening to a particular art and then we start to gravitate towards that art form more. For example, try to remember the last good song that you heard. You will find that it is not that distant in the future. Another factor that influences this argument is the type of music you like. If you like serious sombre tones, then the present music of bollywood wouldn\u2019t satisfy you. But you can look towards the indie scene of India, which features some great artists. Rock and Fusion fans look towards the live performance of local bands more than the movie music. Some great and beautiful songs of past 25 years have come from indie artists in India. Hariharan, KK, Shaan have also started from there. Also, to realize the true leaps being made in terms of music, you need only watch Coke Studio. It has brilliant artists doing things they wouldn\u2019t do in a live show. Lastly, the old songs were outstanding because more emphasis was given to singers and vocals. This era has devoted their effort towards music and instruments, so much so that singers have become secondary in a song. Music lovers appreciate good music, but it doesn\u2019t always have to be the taste of the masses. For instance, The Humma Song by A. R. Rehman was derided as he took his own classic track changed it completely. What everyone ignored was the outstanding changes Rehman made to the music and base-line of the track. The lack of the rock-and-roll hook stuck as boring to most people. But Rehman brought Dubstep and Fusion into mainstream bollywood and as a result, now people are loving that song. It is only a matter of what piques your interest. If you don\u2019t like the mainstream music of today, then don\u2019t listen to it. Explore other genres of music that are niche but so good that you will rarely ever complain again. ",

            "answer_text": "ITS ABOUT THE TASTE OF EVERYONE. Music in present days are lot more enthusiastic, lively, n gives the pace of euphoria in ones life. But the music in the olden days were jst about the voice and wordings, it was believe that if someone get broken form their heart, they start singing all that shit he did fo her, n all that relationship shit. But, yeah it was meaningful, in making your mood down as it was damm slow. Presently the music is fast and progresive, which literally make ones feel positive. What is wrong with slow music, its like when you hear fast music certain neuro-chemical compounds, like adrenaline and dopamine is released, and one feels happy. But slow music is incapable doing so. And remaining about the taste, the present is far beter and make the moment Ear-GRASAMIC. It depends on oneself about how one take the situation/circumstance/selection. Rest, everything have their own taste. You cant compare Bob marley With Nekroglobin. ",
