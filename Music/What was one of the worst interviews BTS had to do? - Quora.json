This came to the boys\u2019 ears, what is worse is that he had to interview them. The interview was so uncomfortable it never came out complete.  Also, the b-free one.  ",

            "answer_text": "The majority of the US ones (grammy meseum interview is the best). Most of the time they ask questions to denigrate BTS, their ARMY or both. Some questions are meant to make ARMY speak bad of BTS. Other questions are utter nonsence and ask for personal information like who they are dating. The only reason I watch them is for Kim Namjoon because he knows how to respond to all those nonsense. The interviews in other countries are much better. Right now I\u2019m heading to check if they have any portugese interviews since I can manage in portugese and BTS are in Brazil *Danel runs hastily to get ear phones ",
