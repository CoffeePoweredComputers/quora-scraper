            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \u201cuse\u201d an album song or its \u201ccover?\u201d You can \u201cuse\u201d a song or cover by enjoying it personally. Seems pretty obvious. But if you want to copy and reproduce a song recording and the artwork of the album cover, the other contributors here correctly point out that you need the rights from the recording company. You also need the rights to reproduce the music composition. As Todd mentions below, the recording companies have licensing departments. The type of license and rights you can get to \u201cuse\u201d an album song and/or album cover for a fee will depend on the context of your use. The license also will restrict how you can use the works. If you are using a small portion of a song or showing the cover, let\u2019s say in a lecture for educational purposes, your use may be protected under the fair use doctrine as long as you don\u2019t use too much of a work or take away its economic value. When I first saw the question, the word \u201ccover\u201d in the question made me think of a question on whether you can do a \u201ccover\u201d of a song, that is, perform your own interpretation of the original composition of a song (and not reproduce the actual recording). If that\u2019s the case, you can do a cover at least in the USA if you follow the mechanical license process for covers set out in the US Copyright Act. Essentially, the song must have been previous released in a recording, you must notify the owners of the copyright in the music composition that you plan to do a cover, you pay the statutory license fee per copy of the song (or you can negotiate a different rate with the copyright owners), and you provide an annual report of the song\u2019s distribution. I\u2019m not sure that was the nature of the question, but I hope this discussion is beneficial. ",

            "answer_text": "The law in the USA and many other countries treat music licensing as a flat fee payment system, with no negotiation or contract required as long as the fees are paid. The song authors (or owners of the copyright on the song, which are often sold to publishers) get paid for each copy of the song sold or distributed. Note that this applies when a song writer is also the recording artist. Legally, they must pay themselves to use their song. A similar system applies to live music performances. The venue that holds the performance must pay the music rights agency in order to legally cover the copyright costs for the music. Because most live performances don\u2019t track individual songs, the payments are collective, and the agency distributes them among the many copyright holders they represent. So why can\u2019t you do this in other mediums? Because the music business depends on performances of the song writers songs, and they want a system which ensures payments are made without requiring complicated negotiations and tracking for each performance. When a song is used for something other than a performance, as background music in a movie or video, in advertising, etc., even if it is a cover song, the stock payment rules no longer apply. The stock payments are based on a theory that each performance is of equal value, and the artists are fairly compensated for their work by this system. That is no longer considered true when the music becomes part of another work. A song cover does require the publisher to take care of the payments to the copyright owners, otherwise, it is infringement. But for most cover artists, they don\u2019t make the payments themselves \u2014 it is the venue, or the publisher of their recorded songs, which does that. ",

            "answer_text": "Unless they are licensed, the cover can be an infringing work. The legal record is full of cases of musicians being sued for ripping each other off.

Well, Ray Parker Jr\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters\u201d theme was the subject of extensive litigation with Huey Lewis and the News. Does it sound like a case of \u201cBlurred Lines?\u201d Guess what? So was that song. A cover can either be licensed directly with the copyright holder of the original work, or, in the case of tribute bands, be covered under a blanket license from ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC. ",

For example if you want to release a cover recording, you can pre pay via Clear Cover Song - Synch Print Master Grand Rights - Easy Song Licensing or similar sites. If you want to sync a particular song to picture, ie include the song in a video, then you need explicit consent from the owner(s) of the recording (master) and the owner(s) of the song (publishers and writers of the composition). You have to get them to agree to the use and likely have to pay them money for it. ",
