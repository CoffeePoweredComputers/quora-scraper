            "answer_text": "At age fifty-three, Marijohn wrote her most famous song, \u201cOne Day at a Time.\u201d Here\u2019s the story behind the song, just as she told it to me: \u201cI really could not understand why I was having so much success in the country music field. Although I had enjoyed quite a rush as a country writer, I had reached the end of my rope. I truly felt that I had been called to be a gospel writer, but I couldn\u2019t seem to get there. I was in the music scene up to my ears in Nashville. Wherever it was \u2018happening,\u2019 I was there, helping to make it happen. Yet I became frustrated! I\u2019d had it! \u201cI stopped by a small church and asked a young minister if I could talk with him. I found out later that I was the first person he had counseled. I drove up in my new, midnight blue Cadillac, dressed in a full-length mink coat with sparkling jewelry and my cowboy boots. I said, \u2018I have all kinds of problems.\u2019 He looked at me and said, \u2018You look like you don\u2019t have any financial problems.\u2019 I answered, \u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019 He said, \u2018You look pretty healthy.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, I guess I am.\u2019 He then asked, \u2018What is your main problem?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 He didn\u2019t seem to know what more to say to me. \u201cAt that point in our conversation, he said a funny thing, but it was okay, because it worked. He asked, \u2018Did you ever think about thanking God for your problems?\u2019 (Ephesians 5:20). I left his office and drove back home. \u201cWhen I reached the house, I found it was empty, and I was glad. I sat down at the piano and began to play and sing\u2014out loud\u2014the entire chorus to \u2018One Day at a Time.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking from You. Just give me the strength to do every day, what I have to do.\u2019 It just dropped into my heart. And when I had finished singing, my \u2018Nashville mind\u2019 said, \u2018That\u2019s a hit!\u2019 That was the first thing that popped into my head. I then recognized that the song was a prayer\u2014and I got some relief. \u201cI wrote the chorus on the back of an envelope as fast as I could write. I then continued to sing, \u2018Do You remember when You walked among men? Well, Jesus, You know, if You\u2019re looking below, it\u2019s worse now than then.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t quite sure the Lord knew where I was. I\u2019d never quit believing in Him, but I was in Nashville and God was in heaven, and never the twain shall meet. I really didn\u2019t know if God actually knew where I was. I realize that some don\u2019t believe that, but that was where I was at the time. \u201cThe following morning, my mind went back to the song. I had the second verse and the chorus, but somehow I couldn\u2019t get the song started properly. Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge, who were married at the time, were in town. They had just had a huge hit, \u2018Why Me, Lord?\u2019 written by Kris. Their recording had won a Dove Award for them. I called Kris and asked him to help me with the first verse. He had written songs for my company, Buckhorn Music, and we\u2019d had some pretty big hits as a publisher. \u201cWhen I showed him how I started the song, \u2018I\u2019m just a mortal . . .\u2019 he looked at me and said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you say, \u201cI\u2019m only human, I\u2019m just a man . . .\u201d I said, \u2018That\u2019s good! That\u2019s what I need.\u2019 We finished the first verse in about twenty minutes. The lines just flew out from each of us.\u201d The song, first recorded by Marilyn Sellers, rose to become the number one song in several categories. In this country, it was first a hit on the country charts and then it crossed over to the pop charts. It was the number one pop song in England, the number one country song in Ireland, and among the top ten in two other countries. Each recording has been by a different artist in that particular country. It has long since passed the six hundred mark in artist recordings and has crossed over into the Southern Gospel Music genre.
