I'm not up on the latest offerings and your preference will be personal, but all the major players offer products with excellent piano touch through weighted keys - Yamaha, Roland, Kurzweil, etc.   I suggest browsing through their respective product websites and visit a local retailer for some hands-on to determine your preference.
