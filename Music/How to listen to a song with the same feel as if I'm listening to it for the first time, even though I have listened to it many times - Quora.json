We all have certain songs that we really connect to which will make that song and feeling last. A way to keep it fresh is to explore other artists and have a lot of music to choose from so when that song you really like comes on you will get that fresh feeling because it\u2019s that one of few that stands out to you! So it\u2019s different with every person but just don\u2019t overplay the songs you love when you first hear them and they will last a lot longer! ",

            "answer_text": "If you have heard the song many times, hopefully you know it enough to know the words. Assuming your alone, sing the some like your in the band. If your around other people you may want to do this in your head. It\u2019s kind of a mental trick, but it helps me when I hear a loved song. God knows I do not have a great voice, or even a good one, but when I\u2019m singing along with The Stones or Led Zeppelin, none of that matters, but I feel connected to the song or artist for that 4 minutes.
