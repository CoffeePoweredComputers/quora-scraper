            "answer_text": "Spotify seems to be the most popular one, though it doesn\u2019t let you choose what to listen to without paying, much like Pandora. We\u2019ve all tried things like Limewire, and gotten hit by that. But to be honest, the best free music app was Grooveshark - however they were shut down years ago. The correct answer is, for playing music you want to listen to, there are none. This is because most government entities have taken a harsher view on copyright infringement (which, sharing music without the copyright holder\u2019s permission, is) in the last 15 years than in the past. If you\u2019re fine with random music and adverts, use Spotify or Pandora free. Bonus bit: if you should happen to be willing to pay for a service, I prefer Youtube music. Google recently improved Youtube Music to a Pandora-like service, for US$9.99/month - but there\u2019s the added perk of using Google Play families for an additional US$5 a month to allow up to five family members to share that subscription with you. Other people will swear by Pandora and others still will swear by Spotify. I\u2019ve used both of those services, and I can only tell you what I prefer. Hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "InsTube is of great use. It\u2019s a nice video&music downloader I have used before. Downloading videos and songs in a high speed and little cellular is helpful for saving more files. And I like the lock feature which can hide my downloaded videos and music to the private space. On the other hand, you can choose different format when downloading a video or music and you can choose an HD video of 1280p.  Taking SoundCloud as an example: 1. You can open InsTube and enter SoundCloud website. 2. At there you can search for the music you like. 3. Once you find out the music, you can click on it and a red download button on the bottom right of the screen will pop up. 4. Tap on it and choose the MP3 format to start downloading. If you need any help you can watch the following video:  ",
