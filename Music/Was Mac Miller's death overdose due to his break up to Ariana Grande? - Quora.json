            "answer_text": "Ariana Grande is in no way responsible for the substance abuse and ultimate overdose of her ex-boyfriend, artist Mac Miller.  It\u2019s toxic thinking to make Ariana Grande responsible for the additions of Mac Miller, her ex-boyfriend whom she broke up with early 2018 as she couldn\u2019t handle his substance abuse anymore. We see the perfect couple photos, but I can imagine she struggled with watching him and his addiction. Eventually, she made the right decision for her own mental health to leave that toxic relationship.  Here is a tweet from Ariana Grande posted soon after their break-up became public and she had received massive back lash for \u201cbreaking his heart\u201d from Mac Miller fans. \u201cI have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety & prayed for his balance for years.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t share about how hard, or scary it was while it was happening but it was.\u201d These are key points to understand. She has obviously shown she\u2019s been dealing with this for years in secret, and it has been scary for her. Just stop and think about this. Imagine yourself in a relationship with somebody in such a dark place that they turn to drugs and alcohol and develop a toxic addiction. You care for them and watch them go through overdoses and have the constant fear that one day they will just die on you. This is horrible. For both, but especially the person having to care for them. It\u2019s hard. Ariana grande had to break up with Mac Miller for her own mental sanity. Mac Miller history with depression, alcohol and drug use: Here is a quote from Mac himself in an interview with Billboard in 2013 discussing his drug/alcohol use \"I was not happy and I was on lean very heavy,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cI was so f---ed up all the time it was bad. My friends couldn\u2019t even look at me the same. I was lost.\" Ariana Grande was dating Mac Miller at this time also and would have kept her struggles with looking after him a secret which is completely unfair on her. Then, not long after their unsurprising break-up Mac was driving around Los Angelos and crashed his car at high speed wrapping it around a tree. He was arrested for a DUI and being 2 times above the legal alcohol limit. Here are some photos:   This is insane. He could have easily died here, and this is a public snapshot of his destructive behavior as a result of his addiction. He also revealed in a 2015 Billboard Interview \u201cI\u2019m not doing as many drugs. It just eats at your mind, doing drugs every single day, every second. It\u2019s rough on your body.\u201d Not doing as many drugs, but still using. He\u2019s always been open about his battle with addiction. The reason I\u2019m putting this information in my answer is to convey to the public, how addiction was long a presence in his life- and Ariana Grande cannot be made responsible for this. It\u2019s extremely cruel and unjust. She\u2019s a human being that is no doubt grieving right now and has to deal with these hateful accusations, people need to stop this and see that they are speaking to someone who loved him and dealt with this for the longest time. Mac Miller \u201cSuicial Thoughts\u201d Mac also expressed suicidal thoughts. He claimed that his song \u201cGrand Finale\u201d which was the closing song of his 2014 album about coke and drugs, was \u201csupposed to be the last song I made on earth,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way as much anymore.\u201d Please understand, Mac Miller was deeply deeply troubled. He had a long and complicated relationship with drugs and alcohol. Ariana Grande was the love of his life and you could actually argue she likely helped him out of these suicidal thoughts while they were together. I\u2019d bet she had nights where she pleaded him to stay with her and to stop this before he dies. Don\u2019t be cruel and think about who you are hurting before you ignorantly accuse her of being the reason for his death. Ariana Grande recently turned off comments on her Instagram because of mean comments like this:   WHAT IN THE HELL?? Only a sick minded person would comment this and I can\u2019t believe the number of sick minded people there are in her Instagram comments. It\u2019s disgusting! I feel for her so so much.  She\u2019s been through a terrorist attack during her concert which killed countless of her fans (her getting off the plane after the attack to meet Mac Miller, noticeably crying and distraught) and now her ex-boyfriend someone she loved, but had to leave for her own health has died. On top of that, she\u2019s recieving the blame when it is NOT HER FAULT!  I hope Ariana Grande can be strong. But this is a lot to put onto a single person. The chances of her turning to substance abuse or suicidal thoughts as a result of all these things out of her control are very high. As a fan, and I\u2019d like to think decent human being, I hope she is going to be okay. These comments and cruel hashtags could end someone\u2019s life. Think before you type. ",

            "answer_text": "To blame his overdoes on Ariana Grande and their break up is an insult to both of those people, and is evil. Ariana is suffering enough losing one of her closest friends, and probably feels like she could have and should have done more. I have lost a close personal friend, and there wasn\u2019t much I could do to stop it, but I still constantly thought what if I did this or that. Ariana is going through enough and doesn\u2019t need trolls causing her more pain in her time of mourning. As for Mac Miller to think a break up would be enough to drive him to destroying his body is an outrage. Yes people do overdose accidentally and sometimes intentionally due to break ups, but the drug problem was effecting him while he was with Ariana which means there were a lot bigger things going on than just a break up. Perhaps even those closest to Mac don\u2019t know all of the demons he was facing, but whatever they were it was clearly a lot. Probably one of his bigger problems was the reception of his latest album. He was a very popular artist who blew up and become world famous. Then when his most recent album dropped people didn\u2019t like it as much as his previous work, and many people bashed it. That may seem like a small thing to some people, but anybody who has poured their heart and soul into something just for people to treat it like trash knows how bad that hurts. Also being a top artist like him comes with a whole new level of pressure. You can\u2019t just be good when you\u2019re at that level you have to constantly be better. And the higher you are on that mountain the further you have to fall. He had drug addiction, work problems, relationship troubles, and that\u2019s what the public knew of; imagine all the stuff he was going with that he kept inside because his job wasn\u2019t to have problems and be a normal human. His job was to entertain and be a super human. His death was a tragedy, but he was a good person. Don\u2019t insult his memory with click baits trying to create drama. Destroying people\u2019s lives is not worth 15 seconds of fame. ",
