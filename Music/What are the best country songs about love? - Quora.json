            "answer_text": "That's a loaded question. How many country songs are there about love? I think everyone has ones that affect them in different ways. What some might like. Others may not. I have been emotional affected by Keith Urban song \u201c l told you so\u201d . It always affects me. My wife may have left me. But l will always love her. Though she doesn't admit it. Both her and our son need me. I'm always here for them. This is my story. Because love doesn't judge or have conditions. Love is love. You give it expecting nothing. You just give it. Sure I'm a fool to others. But l know they appreciate it. Even if it is never shown. Thanks \u2026l hope you like that song. ",
