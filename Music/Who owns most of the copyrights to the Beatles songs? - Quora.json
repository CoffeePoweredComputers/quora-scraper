            "answer_text": "Dick James was the Beatles original music publisher and had the lions share of interest in Northern Songs, the company John and Paul set up for their publishing. James relationship with the two Beatles soured, and their breakup was clearly on the horizon so he cashed out while he could and sold his shares to ATV. Ultimately John and Paul sold their shares to ATV as well, since they couldn\u2019t control the company anyway based on their small %\u2019s. Michael Jackson bought ATV in the 80\u2019s, outbidding Paul himself (Yoko, infamously, refused to chip in to Paul\u2019s bid figuring she had John\u2019s songwriting royalties anyway - certainly enough to live on.). When Michael Jackson had financial problems, his most valuable asset was ATV so he sold half to Sony. When Jackson died, Sony had the option to buy out the other half - which they exercised. So the answer is Sony owns the publishing rights to the Beatles catalog. The individuals (Paul, Olivia Harrison, Yoko etc.) own the songwriting rights. ",

            "answer_text": "The music royalties for any musician belong to whoever is the legal owner of those royalties. If an artist is persuaded to surrender those royalties in exchange for a chance to hit the big time, well, that\u2019s why a lot of artists end up making lots of money for other people. The early Beatles signed their long-term rights away and made many people rich even as their contract (and, in spite of their tax rates) allowed them to enjoy the huge incoming money anyway. John Lennon said, \u201cWe weren\u2019t businessmen,\u201d and others (including the government) got most of the money generated by the success of the Beatles. After many years of paying royalties to perform their own creations, Paul McCartney got into a bidding war for ownership to the rights to the Beatle songs that he lost to the superior bid from his friend Michael Jackson.
