            "answer_text": "Sir Elton John wrote this song along with his writing partner, Bernie Taupin as a tribute to John Lennon. There are parts of the song that are referencing to Lennon, which I will get into right now. What happened hereAs the New York sunset disappearedI found an empty garden among the flagstones there Who lived hereHe must have been a gardener that cared a lotWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop And now it all looks strangeIt's funny how one insect can damage so much grain And what's it forThis little empty garden by the brownstone doorAnd in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more Who lived hereHe must have been a gardener that cared a lotWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazedA gardener like that one, no one can replace And I've been knockingBut no one answersAnd I've been knockingMost all the day Oh, and I've been callingOh, hey hey JohnnyCan't you come out to play And through their tearsSome say he farmed his best in younger yearsBut he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear Who lived thereHe must have been a gardener that cared a lotWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop Now we pray for rain and with every drop that fallsWe hear, we hear your name And I've been knockingBut no one answersAnd I've been knockingMost all the day Oh, and I've been callingOh, hey hey JohnnyCan't you come out to play And I've been knockingBut no one answersAnd I've been knockingMost all the day Oh, and I've been callingOh, hey hey JohnnyCan't you come out, can't you come out to play Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty gardenJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty gardenJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden In the first verse, the line \u2018What happened here\u2014 As the New York sunset disappeared\u2019 this references that New York no longer had the sunset it used to have, as it was mourning Lennon\u2019s death and because he lived there at the time of his death. In the first chorus, the line \u2018Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey JohnnyCan't you come out to play\u2019. This lyric is parallel to \u2018Dear Prudence\u2019 a beatles song that was written by Lennon, this catchy lyric signifies the song: \u2018Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?\u2019 In the second verse, the line \u2018Some say he farmed his best in younger years\u2019, implies Lennon\u2019s success during his years as a Beatle, as they were his best years as a musician. (Though I would beg to differ since he did have a few catchy tunes as a solo artist!) Lastly, the outro: \u2018Can't you come out to play in your empty garden Johnny Can't you come out to play in your empty garden\u2019 The words portray Elton John\u2019s melancholy as he\u2019s calling out \u2018Johnny\u2019 to come out to play in what has now become an \u2018Empty Garden\u2019.  Sigh, what an amazing duo they were on stage together.. ",
