He has his own group of doctors and his team of about 120 members to take care of his need, starting from his work to home ! He has a very well maintained diet. When he visited India, he had organic bananas and seed less grapes as his foor prodeucts besides many other things ! He always has mineral water to keep himself hydrated to a great extend. His wife Hailey takes care of his beauty regime :) Moreover as the son of Pettie Mannette who is also very cute, he ought to be so. Another thing is his smile and his thin but well toned body makes him look cool. Moreover he opts for normal and bright colours for clothing which gives him the cute nature and not too bold. He also opts for rather over sized clothes which includes mainly sweat shirts and pants . If you want to be cute, opt for colours like pink, yellow, white , etc. ",
