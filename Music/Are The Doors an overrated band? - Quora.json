            "answer_text": "Short answer: It really depends what you\u2019re looking for in a band. Long answer: I love The Doors. Second only to Pink Floyd, they\u2019re my favorite musical group of all time (sorry to all the Led Zeppelin fans, but at least Zep is in my top five). I love their music and the group dynamic they had. Jim Morrison, as my bio says, is my favorite singer; I adore his voice. All that being said, they got lucky as far as the music industry goes. Serendipity, we\u2019ll call it. Their first album was immensely popular when it was released, and still is today. For a lot of rock bands (and just musicians in general), this is far from the norm. But they were portrayed as counter-culture musicians of the late 60s, something that appealed to a younger demographic disillusioned with the Vietnam War, racial injustice, and so on and so forth. In addition, after the New Haven incident, where Jim was arrested on stage, The Doors became associated with an anti-authority ideology, which only increased their popularity. Based on this, an argument could be made that The Doors are overrated. However, all four are exceptional musicians (with perhaps the exception of John Densmore, but even still, he is a talented and good drummer). The greatest of all four is, without a doubt, Ray Manzarek. He was a phenomenal keyboardist, up there with Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman and the other greats (I love prog rock, so those are the two that came to mind immediately). Listen to songs like \u201cLight My Fire\u201d and \u201cRiders on the Storm\u201d to get a good idea of Ray\u2019s style. Robby Krieger is definitely not the most well known rock guitarist, but you can hear his classical training in flamenco in \u201cSpanish Caravan,\u201d something that not many other guitarists I\u2019m familiar with know how to do. His solo in \u201cLight My Fire\u201d is great, and he has great parts in \u201cShip of Fools,\u201d \u201cPeace Frog,\u201d and \u201cRoadhouse Blues.\u201d I\u2019m going to skip Jim and John, I think, because my personal bias will get in the way of a (hopefully) objective answer. What I\u2019ll say is this: John is a good drummer, and Jim\u2019s voice seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it sort of thing for everyone, and not everyone digs his poetry. As far as live shows went\u2026 it would be a stretch to say they were unparalleled, but I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s pretty darn close. Jim was the inimitable frontman, sexy and mysterious and charismatic all at once. He really, I mean really, knew how to work the crowd and play to their interests (especially if his stage outfits were anything to go by, but I digress). For fans of The Lovin\u2019 Spoonful, Jim used to bring John Sebastian (who also recorded the harmonica part on the studio version of \u201cRoadhouse Blues\u201d) up on stage to play harmonica on Willie Dixon\u2019s \u201cLittle Red Rooster\u201d quite often, a treat for some fans to be sure. Between the hits they played, the intermittent poetry Jim injected at random points, and the extended bluesy jams they played, The Doors\u2019 live shows are truly something else to hear, never mind watch. If you\u2019re not a fan of blues, it\u2019s quite easy to make the argument that The Doors were overrated. After all, unlike many rock bands, they returned to their blues roots after a few decidedly more psychedelic albums, essentially traversing musical history in reverse. It makes for a very interesting research topic, but again, that\u2019s neither here nor there. Not everyone likes real bluesy music, and that\u2019s okay. To me, that\u2019s part of their appeal. I do think that there is a good amount of people that like The Doors because of their association with the counter-culture movement and \u201cmind-expanding\u201d lyrics that they were so famous for (in their earlier albums, anyway). That said, I genuinely enjoy the music they produced, by and large. Sure, not all of it is the greatest, but that\u2019s true for any band. I firmly believe that they had a big effect on rock music that caused a ripple going into the 70s. Lastly, don\u2019t take it personally if someone tells you that something you like is overrated. Life\u2019s too short to worry much about what other people think. ",

            "answer_text": "The musicians involved in the actual band, as in backing up Jim Morrison, were immensely talented. Morrison himself was a pretty great natural singer. Unpracticed without a doubt, but great. He had such a vibe that made you want to be part of what was happening. He sounds warm and distant all at once. His lyrics seem to make sense when you hear them. Together, the band and his voice are what really made The Doors the presence that they were. As a long time fan of the group it pains me to admit to their shortcomings. In my opinion, only the The Doors, Strange Days, and L.A. Woman hold any water as excellent albums. There are great cuts on their other releases, but only enough to compile your standard Greatest Hits collection. \u201cBut that\u2019s 50% of their catalog while Jim was alive!\u201d you say. Yep, it was. The Doors were a miscalculated success. Many of their greatest songs were written before their popular career even started. They basically performed their first two albums (the first two excellent ones) at their early bar gigs. After the well ran dry, and Mr. Mojo Risin\u2019 certainly did not, their material quickly deteriorated. L.A Woman, while awesome, is largely a larger drunk man singing over a great blues band finally giving into their roots. Add to this the ongoing stage antics of Jim. Imagine a popular singer of today allegedly pulling out his member on stage as Jim did in Miami. How would that be treated? I\u2019m against political correctness in most forms, but that\u2019s crass. When I was a teenager, it was written about and seen as a sign of his rebellious spirit. Hmm. In summary, I honestly believe you could grab a drunken creative writing major with a great voice and throw him onstage with the best local jazz/rock band around and you\u2019d roughly have The Doors. Again, I say this as a huge fan of their music. There is no accounting for the personality of the performers and The Doors had that in spades. But as for an overrated band, I\u2019d have to say yes.

They were highly accomplished musically, they had songwriting chops and they had a sexy lead singer with an incredible voice. Jim Morrison was not a technically good singer, but his voice had a power and an urgency to it that is matched by few other rock singers and every member of the band sounds like no one else. Morrison may have been a pretentious little twerp in interviews, and his poetry is\u2026well, it has potential but it wasn\u2019t even close to being good yet\u2026 but he was such a great rock star. Yes, if you write down the lyrics of the \u201cThe End\u201d they seem, at best, kind of silly: but the way they work with the music\u2026it just works. Robbie Krieger is one of the most underrated guitarists of the sixties: his fluid, melodic, jazzy lines, add as much as the spooky keyboards to the music and mesh perfectly with Densmore\u2019s syncopated drumming. Goddamn they were good, and they made some kick-ass records. They are a missing link between the jammed out late sixties rock and intellectual bent of the punk scene and seem more connected, intellectually to the super-arty Velvet Underground, their almost exact contemporaries on the East Coast. Listen to \u201cFive to One.\" That song is just\u2026it scares me. It is true that not all of their albums are equal: I always think that The Soft Parade and Waiting for the Sun had too much filler on them, but then I knew Doors fans for whom those albums are the greatest\u2026and a mediocre Doors album is still a pretty good album, in my opinion. Now I will say there are times in my life when the Doors have become very very popular: when I was in college in the early nineties, around the time of the Oliver Stone movie I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without hearing them . AT that point I did get sick of them, the same way I got sick of R.E.M. and Led Zeppelin, who were also everywhere. Maybe they are overrated by teenagers who think that Jim Morrison was, like, super deep. But they were not overrated \u2014 if nothing else they have an easy two discs of stone-cold classics and, really, four awesome albums. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me first be clear that I love The Doors. It\u00b4s one of my favorite bands ever, I have all their albums and I went to see \u201cThe Doors of the XXI Century\u201d in concert when Ray Manzarek was still with us. Having said that \u2014 Yes, The Doors are overrated. The good: They were innovators, they created new and strange music and made a serious and successful attempt to mix poetry with rock music. Dylan had done it, yes, but Dylan was more parable and symbolic story-telling than poetry per se. Jim was a good poet and had great charisma, Ray was an organ virtuoso. They often quoted Bach and the guitarist could manage to write a few smash singles, like Light my fire, a simple but effective ditty. Their music can take you to magical places. I can listen to Wintertime Love over and over. Ray is fabulous there. The bad: They have two great albums: The Doors and Morrison Hotel. The others are chaotic, disorganised, and while they have good songs, they stray a lot and amount to nothing. Some songs are simply horrible. It\u00b4s a miracle they didn\u00b4t release The Celebration of the Lizard (only recently available in the studio version), they are totally lost. In their last album, LA Woman, Jim\u00b4s voice is simple gone. He couldn\u00b4t sing anymore, and the band lost its creativity. Boring blues standards with mediocre execution (Cars hiss by my window), silly pop songs (Love her madly), Jim reciting poetry and the band playing like they\u00b4re not listening to the singer (Texas Radio). The ugly: They were a functional for about two or three years. But they burned out fast, and in the end they did albums by miracle. They began to sound terrible onstage and legend says that John Sebastian who played harp in Roadhouse Blues said he didn\u00b4t want to be in the album credits because he\u00b4d be embarrassed. We have to remember that in their time nobody wanted to hire The Doors, because Morrison was seen as a dirty, non-bathing troublemaking hippie and the band in general played bad. Jim Morrison who had a very loyal fan base and was the favorite of pseudointellectual reporters and film makers and the like, died when just in time to give the band a legendary status. P.S. Ray, Robbie and John made two more albums. Without the distraction that Morrison was, they reveal what the band really was. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a big Doors fan I'll point that out now but I'm gonna answer this as no they are not an overrated band. Their is some valid points on why many people mostly people from the era the doors existed are overrated. I belive other answers have Pointed out and I agree that part of their popularity came from their anti- establishment habits. Jim Morrison was seen pretty quickly as the ultimate rebel against society defiently skyrocketing their fame a little bit. So other musicians who gained most of their popularity from the music and not any image or personal related ways seem to get upset over the Doors fame. Many people didn't really believe rhe doors would be all that remembered maybe faintly as another band from that era. But it turned out they have been remembered and are now seen by people from today as one of he iconic bands of the 1960s. Why I think they are not overrated well one because the make awesome music. Most people tend to stay with the hits when it's the doors you know the singles they released. While those songs are gold liLuke light my fire, break on through, hello I love you it's their album Content such as Not to touch the earth, five to one, when the musics over, the end, waiting for the sun, hyacinth house that's classic doord music right there. They are all talented musicians Robbie krieger is often praised for his flamenco influences and infer slides that created the perfect psychedelic sound for their music. Ray Manzareck is an excellent rock keyboardist and is easily the defining musician in the band to he the iconic doprs sound. I also belive they aren't overrated because they have made it this far and out still remembered. I belive the reasoning for this is because part of their lyrics and style were a little ahead of their time. The doors anti establishment style was perfect for the latr 1960s but their lyrics were very different from the times. The doors weren't very hippy like and didn't go into the peace and love and doing protest songs and all that. So one could make that counter argument on the argument they are only famous because of the time they played. Their lyrics and music represent better with the punk and alternative rock seen in the 1980s and 1990s. So really that is a huge reason ehh they are still remembered because they are a clear influence of many music genres that have lasted today. Jim Morrison frontman style has been copied and seen with Joy Division, The stooges, the strokes, and even had influence on nirvana. So their influence, being a little ahead of their time, and overall great music outside of the chart topping hits are the reason the doors are not an overrated band. ",

            "answer_text": "The Doors were a great band. The fact that a band could put out their first album and have it sell so well is testament to that. The band started to drop out of favor with critics from the underground press after their second album \u2018Strange Days\u2019 who argued the band lost its\u2019 integrity and sold out for pop hits. The thing is that many bands, then and now, release albums and singles that the producers like. So, unless you signed a contract like Prince in which you have total artistic control you are at the mercy of the producer of the album. With albums from bands such as the Electric Prunes you have a strong first single and a first album was hurried in an effort to cash in on their recent success. The band was already composing material for what they hoped would be an album of their own design. However, much of the album's content was out of their control as producer Dave Hassinger brought in the songwriting team of Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz. They, alone, produced seven of the 12 tracks, much to the frustration of the band. Mark Tulin and James Lowe, the band's main songwriters, were limited to just one track, the song \"Luvin'\". The band considered some of the tracks just as filler and were disappointed in not having a choice in disclosing them. Tulin stated \"We had nothing resembling freedom, let alone total freedom, in the selection of our songs. Consequently, there are definitely songs that I do believe didn't belong on the album...\" The time of The Doors putting out epic length songs like \u201cThe End\u201d and \u201cWhen The Music\u2019s Over\u201d had come to end after the second album. But, I would still argue that songs of a shorter length such as \u201cThe Unknown Soldier\u201d and \u201cNot To Touch The Earth\u201d were just as valid. The Doors were at an end with the release of \u2018L.A. Woman\u2019 the band was at a stalemate with their usual producer Paul Rothchild who did not want anything to do with it. This album was produced by the Doors and Bruce Botnick (their longtime studio engineer). I think that Jim Morrison was done with the music industry at that point and there was no plan to record anything by him after that as he was fully disenchanted. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll say no, they aren\u2019t overrated, for a couple of reasons. And I\u2019m just going to focus on where the music is now in terms of the music lexicon. I\u2019m writing this as someone who only \u2018discovered\u2019 them in 1979. So I can\u2019t attest at all to what they were in their day. But since that time, I have seen their notoriety decline. Among the younger people I know, The Doors are familiar by name, but not by reputation or by artistic merit. So, strictly by where their reputation is now, I think it would be hard to rate them lower, considering where they once were. In terms of the music, the lyrics, the bluster and the psychedelic blues, they are still relatively unique. They stick out as a band when you play their work side by side with other bands from their time. Morrison would probably appreciate this comparison: they are to their times what William Blake was to the other Romantic poets who came along later. So this isn\u2019t to say that they are better than The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and many others, but they inhabit a separate throne in the Rock pantheon with their ability to turn our mesmerizing incantatory songs alongside rugged blues performances. On one album you could go from something that a more put together Charles Manson might write (look up Charlie\u2019s \u201cCease To Exist\u201d - the song that was re-titled and became a Beach Boys\u2019 song), to \u201cRoadhouse Blues\u201d to the deft melding of classical guitar and haunting exoticism of \u201cSpanish Caravan.\u201d And then a few hit-oriented songs. My point is that, even though they might never reach the heights they once hit, they are currently highly underrated. ",

            "answer_text": "Roughly speaking, Rock and roll is the soundtrack for a certain type of exploration, decadence and sin. Excess, destruction and youth-driven bombast are its calling cards. A life lived by the fingertips and spun out of spit, jizz and wits are its preferred audience. No wonder I love the stuff. At its best, rock and roll is brash, theatrical, rising from the steamy confines of an unwashed denim crotch. It\u2019s not supposed to be tasteful, that\u2019s not what it does. The Doors did youthful bombast better than anyone. I will forever love them. I was ten years old and \u2018Light my Fire\u2019 was a hit. It scared the shit out of me but I was drawn to it. With a mouth full of Necco Wafers and fingers nervously clawing a broken Slinky, I cocked a pink, malleable ear toward a new sort of sound. Tribal. Sacrificial. Insistent. I heard \u2018Light my Fire\u2019 and knew that someday I was going to get into deep trouble. And I did. The Doors kept me company through all of it. A smattering of years later someone slid L.A. Woman on a turntable. I loved it and made my way to a record store with a few dollars and a pocket full of coins. I decided on \u2018Strange Days\u2019 because the cover looked like I felt. My love affair with Jim Morrison began with the song \u2018When the Music\u2019s Over.\u2019 The lyrics entered my grey matter like a fist rearranging clay, and \u2018til this day the song gives me goosebumps, \u2018When music is your special friend Dance on fire as it intends Music is your only friend Until the end...\u2019 The theatricality of the song was startling. Repetitious chords, slow crawl narration exploding into mayhem, spoken word, primal scream, over the top lyrics that fell on their face then got up to drag you to a dangerous biker bar. \u2018Cancel my subscription to the resurrection, Send my credentials to the house of detention, I\u2019ve got some friends inside- \u2018 Yep, that\u2019s it. That pretty much sums up what I was there for, standing in line, ticket in hand, hash hidden deep inside my Joe Cocker inspired boots, silver-leafed with stars so they looked just like his did during Woodstock, and a belly full of Southern Comfort because that\u2019s what Janis drank. A dozen chemicals warring for dominance in my testosterone tortured head, and a body oblivious to the cold outside because inside waits one rock band or another, and rock and roll is what made being a teenager survivable. Are the Doors an overrated band? Don\u2019t even. At their best the Doors are as good as rock and roll gets. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, first up, I am 25. The only reference I have is listening to their albums  since I was young and catching the few remaining doors on tour a few times. if your looking for a first hand account, then I am sorry to say you will need to wait on another response. I personally feel that the boundaries breeched by the doors have given musicians who have emerged since a much more open and exciting environment in which to develop their music than might have existed in their absence.  The dark and disturbing lyrics of some songs encourage  musicians to approach  emotions such as anger and lust, while Jim's abstract lyrics stand as an example of how modern music does not have to have a rigid and instantly declared moral or meaning.  Beck is a good example of this.   While both he and the doors are worlds apart, their freely flowing lyrics are open for interpretation and do not travel a straight line from A to B. This makes for some truly interesting and fulfilling listening. Even as a fan, I have to admit my enthusiasm for them has lessened as I have revisited their music time after time. But it is important to remember the time in which the doors' music was released and the influence it had.  To judge the first few to \"give it a try\" against those who have evolved from those initial few steps is misleading. It's like saying cave wall paintings are overrated through their comparison to     Picasso. I can not deny my bias being a fan, but the doors to me will always stand out as a turning point for modern music, Where a few men decided to ignore the expected and play with the surreal. ",

            "answer_text": "Rating bands is always about context.  In 1968-69, the Doors were unique and worthy of a reputation as a great band.  If you only know the Doors through listening to albums/CD's, you fail to get the sense of the milieu they were working in. I was going to a lot of concerts in the late 60's including  many of the great bands of the era -- Cream, Led Zep, Jethro Tull, Byrds.  The absolute concert experience was a Doors concert, largely because of the power, some said it was evil, projected by Jim Morrison.  These days, everyone says that \"The End\" is their most memorable song, but in performance, nothing was better than \"Light My Fire.\"  The short poetic pieces like Horse Latitudes worked to create mood.  That was the thing with the Doors.  They were not just playing a line-up of hits; they were creating an experience.  At the end of a Doors concert, you were exhausted. I did visit Morrison's grave in Paris, not exactly as a pilgrimage, but as a tribute.  He was as talented in his own way as Freddie Mercury.  He was one of those people who burn brightly and then are extinguished.  Kurt Cobain.  Janis Joplin. Jimi Hendrix. ",

            "answer_text": "Overrated? Hmm.. to answer that I\u2019ll have to think of the most memorable times I had listening to them. I remember listening to Spotify radio while walking on campus when the song \u201cPeople are Strange\u201d popped on. For the next few minutes, I felt like the band was playing for me. Every lyric hit my conscious like an arrow hits a bullseye. There was a time where I felt particularly flamed out, sitting in bed to kill the day away. I searched on Google \u201csongs to listen to when you\u2019ve had enough\u201d. \u2018The End\u2019 was one of the first recommendations. I listened to all 11 minutes of it. I spent the next few days listening to it. \u2018The End\u2019 is one of those songs that simply won\u2019t get off my mind. It\u2019s mysteriousness is, in my opinion, only rivaled by some of Bowie\u2019s stuff. Jim Morrison is one of those guys who just compells you to start singing. He\u2019s one of the greatest natural talents to have walked the earth. So you could probably guess what my honest answer to this is ;) ",

            "answer_text": "The Doors were one of the greatest bands ever! Their psychedelic rock originality has never been matched. They are truly the most original band that America has produced. They made just six studio albums in five years, and you need three full records to do their anthology !!! No other band has that distinction ! That\u2019s a very small lead compared to the intense experience of listening to their music. They are truly legendary. Jim morrison\u2019s uniquely suited voice, his hypnotic singing quality, the doors\u2019 great instrumental mastery, their highly original compositions make them truly unique in the music world\u2026 Their greatest albums are \u2018Strange days\u2019, \u2018The Doors\u2019, \u2018LA woman\u2019 and \u2018Morrison hotel\u2019. \u2018The soft parade\u2019 and \u2018Waiting for the sun\u2019 are good too with great singles. Their live music is highly organic and dynamic. Just listen to \u2018Absolutely live\u2019, \u2018No one here gets out alive\u2019, and \u2018The Doors at the Hollywood bowl\u2019\u2026 These have some of the best live performances ever recorded.

I think Jim Morrison ate too much acid and other than having a decent voice was a talent-less hack and a lousy poet/lyricist. His \u201cLizard King\u201d thing was creepy. I remember listening to a bootleg tape of a live show wherein he wailed, moaned, muttered and caterwauled \u201c\u2026fuck her in the ass\u2026\u201d for many minutes accompanied by a dirge-like drone of a tune. Not that I have anything against consensual anal sex, it seemed more that a bit unseemly to me at the time. I also associated hearing The Doors tunes with the musty, lusty, smoke-sweat-sex-muskiness of strip clubs I had occasion to visit in the Tenderloin district of SF and on Broadway in San Diego while serving my country in the US Navy. Never really cared for them is all. Don\u2019t mind that others do, I prefer other music to theirs. I think they were overrated. So sue me. ",

He knew how to control the masses.  He understood the psychology of \"group think\" and would have audiences eating out of the palm of his hand.  This carried over to the mystique and legendary quality of the band's reputation.  With mediocre music and only slightly above average poetry, The Doors created a fan base as loyal and defensive as any band could desire.  The culture of the time was ripe to be played against the \"normal\" ways of society and the authority that controlled things to that point.  The Doors were in the right place at the right time.   Now I sit back and wait for all the Doors fans to berate and belittle me.  I'm used to it.  :)  ",

Their albums were great as well and there was nobody else quite like them. They deserve to be held up as one of America's greatest Rock and Roll bands.  Jim Morrison however is definitely over rated. He had a great voice and a good stage presence but his lyrics were often overblown waffle and he doesn't deserve to be taken seriously as a great poet. Listening to live Doors makes it clear that his massive ego ruined a lot of their shows and his attempts to portray himself as a mystical sage just make him look a bit silly. ",

I could tell of at least 4 bands in the same period who really had a very similar feel & sound... maybe the doors was the most complete of them... but we should know by now that no one human has ever invented anything in music...  ...but there are some musicians who brought some of the best melody & harmony combinations ever from the persistent universe of music & sound...  A practical example: Should we praise Beethoven as the composer (creator) of the sounds of The Pastoral? No but we should praise him at least for being the best musician ever to capture in sheet the sounds of the country & nature... he didn't create the way a bird sings... did he? ...the right question would be: Are all bands & composers overrated?
