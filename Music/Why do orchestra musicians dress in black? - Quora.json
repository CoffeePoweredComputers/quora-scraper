            "answer_text": "In an orchestra or choir, the combined efforts of the individuals\u2014the music\u2014is the most important thing.  In the case of an orchestra, you have about 100 people on the stage. Inevitably, there will be (at least) a few people who have more \"flare\" than the others and will want to express that flare in their attire.  Since the most important thing is that no one stands out and detracts from the music, a dress code is established....and it is generally very particular/precise...including shoes, socks, arm length of shirts, jewelry, etc. I should point out not all male orchestra members wear tuxedos. In some orchestras, they can wear black pants and a black (open-collar) shirt.  And in a choir, they can wear any color of robes (red, teal, etc.) ...almost anything as long as everyone wears the same color.   Each organization decides on their dress code (as per above) and the members agree to abide by it (sometimes with lots of grumbling, but that's another story.)  Sometimes orchestras change the dress code particulars to meet the requests of the members (often women, see below) but it's rarely noticeable to the audience as it's often just a small \"tweak\" to all-black. Most major orchestras (in their current form) were founded in the mid- to late-1800s. Prior to that, they were employees of the nobility.  It should be noted that at that time, they contained only *male* members and at that time men's clothes \"went black\" according to author John Harvey in his book \"Men In Black\" (available on Amazon.)  So, it's been this way for about 150 years.  Since women have only recently (last 50-75 years?) been allowed in orchestras, they are often the ones pushing for dress code changes. It's accepted that soloists get to wear whatever they want because they're basically \"the guest of honor\" and you *should* be looking at them.  It's mostly the women though where you will see the most colorful outfits; usually beautiful dresses. I find that male soloists tend to stick with a fancy black tuxedo because almost *every* man looks good in a tuxedo. The conductor generally wears something more \"formal\" than the orchestra to establish his \"rank\" to the audience.  Some conductors prefer the opposite approach and wear the most basic black-only outfit so they don't stand out but also because it gets HOT flapping your arms around for a couple hours in a tuxedo!

            "answer_text": "Professional orchestras publish a sort of book of regulations for musicians, some of which designates what type of clothing is proscribed for each type of performance. For example, for men, evening concerts are usually white tie and tails (a la Bugs Bunny cartoons where he flips the tails over the piano bench). However, some orchestras have men wear tuxedoes (with black tie and no tails, like what a groom might wear at a wedding). For afternoon concerts, it\u2019s almost always a dark suit with either long or bow tie, but not a tuxedo. For summer concerts, it\u2019s usually white dinner jacket, tux pants with the satin stripe down the side, and black tie. It varies with the orchestra, but women are usually asked to wear \u201clong black,\u201d which means either pants or a skirt/dress that reaches the floor when sitting and 3/4 to full sleeves with as few sparkles as possible and a modest neckline. Some even ask for only diminutive jewelry. In the summer, it\u2019s often a white top and black pants/skirt, which makes you look like a busboy, but at least it\u2019s cooler. When I began subbing in the NY Philharmonic in the 1980s, there was a clause about \u201conly simple pearls and simple diamonds\u201d that was much-joked about in the locker room as, er, the salary didn\u2019t allow for a LOT of diamonds!! Ha. When I first started working 40 years ago, many orchestras prohibited women from wearing pants and the skirt had to be a full maxi skirt, to the floor when standing! I played in one orchestra that would dock your pay if the contractor decided your outfit was not OK. That is no longer the case anywhere. The point of all of this is to make the orchestra look organized and uniform, placing the emphasis on the performance. A few orchestras experimented with other looks \u2014 years ago The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra has dark blue velvet outfits. But that could get complicated when substitute musicians filled in and had to borrow such an outfit from a member. It makes much more sense to buy something off the rack that everybody has and is generally the same shade of color. For musical theater (not opera or ballet) where the orchestra is fairly well-hidden in the pit, anything black, including sneakers, is usually just fine. Women can and do wear tuxes and tails sometimes. And I did see one male soloist wear a black tux jacket, black tie, and maxi ball-gown-type skirt, and it looked great. I don\u2019t think any orchestra could legally complain that attire *must* be sex-specific in this day and age. ",
