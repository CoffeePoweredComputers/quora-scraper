The Loudness Wars basically is when record labels wanted \u201chotter\u201d (louder) records so they sell better. They found out that people pay more attention to the louder track queued up on the DJ\u2019s playlist. So they made their tracks as hot as they could be so people pay attention to it, and eventually pay for a copy of the record.Recording medium limits. The older format you use, the quieter the record is, typically. Technology has improved such things as noise floors and headroom, meaning as you advance, you can go louder without making much noise, compression, or distortion. This is a good thing, but it also will bring the average volume up. On the other hand, some media like vinyl sometimes can\u2019t go louder than a certain volume because the record would skip on playback, or in even older shellac records, the needle would jump while recording, which is bad.Style of music/Dynamics. You would be surprised how classical music records are actually the quietest and the loudest records you will listen to. This is because of the dynamics. Classical music has a great range of volume. One passage you can barely hear it, and all of a sudden it will bleed your ears out ten times worse than a heavy metal song. Given the average volume though, it\u2019s on the quieter side. A pop record on the other hand will be recorded hotter, because there\u2019s less dynamics. The volume is pretty much constant. The greater the dynamics, the lower the average volume is, because if it is any louder, then the song will clip and distort, and you don\u2019t want that.This is also how a guitar and vocal track will sound louder than a full band record when you max them out before you clip them. This is because there\u2019s tons of headroom when you have just two things going on, and pushing the loudness can go really far. With a full band mix, you have to give a lot of sonic space and headroom for all the instruments, hence you can only push the loudness a bit before you will have to resort to intense compression.Relative Volume Between Tracks. When mastering a whole record, quiet tracks have to be quiet, and loud tracks have to be loud. In a varied album which contains for example acoustic and full band songs, one has to ensure that all the acoustic stuff are quieter than the full band/electronic ones, because if not, then listening to the album becomes a jarring experience that is so far from reality. Acoustic guitars louder than drums? - that\u2019s not a good album experience. So you have to turn the loud ones up, and the quiet ones down.Now, if you take the acoustic stuff from that album, and compare it to another acoustic track from an all-acoustic album, the latter one will very likely be louder. Why? Because the all-acoustic stuff are pretty much all the same volume, so you can push the average loudness of the whole record up (see second paragraph of point 3). So even between two similar records, you will end up with different volumes, because that will depend in part on what else is on the same record.",

            "answer_text": "You, my friend, have just discovered what the audio industry refers to as 'The Loudness Wars.'  This difference in average volume actually comes from the mastering stage of the production process (rather than recording as you mentioned). As recording technology changed over time, record labels had mastering engineers create louder masters than ever before. They felt this would be a competitive advantage over other albums of lesser volume. It is based on fact, that most average listeners feel that 'louder is better' whether they are aware of this phenomenon of not. So over the years, albums became very compressed and limited to have less dynamics, and a very loud RMS level. Mastering engineers are actually generally against this, and prefer dynamics, but are merely following the labels requests. In reality, radio stations squash the track once again and any loudness advantage that a track had before, is rendered useless upon radio processing. iTunes has the option to enable Soundcheck (and auto-enables this on iTunes radio) which analyzes the average loudness of the track and turns it up or down to create a more seamless listening experience. This is the issue you spoke about experiencing. When algorithms like this start to exist in more places, labels and engineers realize that creating a loud master actually creates the opposite of the intended effect. When level matched, more dynamic tracks sound much better, open, and have their transients in-tact, while severely limited tracks sound small in comparison. Unlike other industries, no music loudness standards exist, but it does seem that the loudness war is on its way out and we are creating more balanced masters. ",
