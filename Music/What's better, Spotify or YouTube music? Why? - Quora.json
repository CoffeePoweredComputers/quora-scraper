            "answer_text": "I am coming up to this conclusion after using both apps for 1 week. Talking about Youtube music :- It has a enormous amount of songs,music videos,live performances, covers all of those songs that you search on youtube are on youtube music app.I would say it has vast library in comparison to any other app in the music app market. Your all liked songs ,playlists on youtube video app syncs directly on youtube music app.Moreover you have a feature of adding a video song directly to your music app playlist. Youtube music gets ahead in this scenario. Well, coming up to spotify :- Spotify is all about playlists. Its' algorithm is designed in such a manner that you get your recommendations on the basis of your choices. Unlike Youtube music app ,User Interface of spotify is so organized and clean that it gets so easy while you discover a new song. Spotify might not have have same number of songs as youtube does but diversity of songs is undoubtedly good in it. You also get a Gapless feature with Spotify. .i.e. there is a fading effect between the interval of two songs. Spotify stops suggesting the genre of songs if you dis like any song. So at the end, if you are a person more into number of songs who does not want to miss any good song . Youtube music is the app for you. If you do like songs to be orchestrated in a good manner ,like other culture songs and want the app do the work for you. You can go with Spotify. ",

            "answer_text": "I use Spotify premium and youtube music premium for 3 months now and here are my thoughts- K-pop listener will love youtube music because of the content of k-pop and the playlist well managed. Youtube music is available in South Korea so you will get all the latest hits based on the Korean market and it is official playlist by youtube music. Where Spotify not launched in Korea so the k-pop playlists are based on popular k-pop songs only. American pop songs playlist are really good in youtube music but Spotify playlist has a bit better songs.Music quality - Spotify uses 320 Kbps MP3 and youtube music uses 256Kbps AAC and believe me in daily life you will not notice the differences. AAC codec is much better than mp3 and those instrumentals are very clear where Spotify will give a little bit more bass that you will not notice in your everyday life.Subscription - I believe both music streaming service has 12 dollars a monthly plan and India youtube music is Rs-99 for youtube premium it is RS-130 and Spotify is Rs-130. In USA Spotify comes Hulu bundle and youtube comes with youtube premium (ad-free youtube and youtube originals). Watch Cobra Kai it\u2019s a great series. Hulu is not available in any countries could be a deal-breaker for other countries people. But what you watch more youtube or Hulu? I watch more youtube.Content - youtube music is a clear winner here. you will find every song and also you can find it by searching by lyrics on youtube music and it has official music videos you can switch to videos to official audio with a single tap. Where Spotify has fewer contents than youtube but it has really good podcasts just check it out.Conclusion - Spotify and youtube music premium both are really great. It\u2019s up to you what you like more. I think youtube premium is a great deal than Spotify because you will get ad-free videos and also youtube original contents where Spotify has good podcasts. So if you don\u2019t care about ad-free videos then go ahead for Spotify.Spotify and Youtube Premium in India - This section is only for Indians. So recently Spotify and youtube music released in India and I found out Spotify in India sucks even you are premium users. Warner music groups and other music company aren't licensed yet. Spotify really messed up in India without taking permission from the artist and added their songs in their library so no Ed-Sheeran, Twenty-one pilots, Charlie Puth and other artists come under warner music and lots of k-pop songs and Indian songs aren't available where youtube music is fully licensed and every songs are available. If you like American pop or K-pop or Indian songs you will enjoy this app. If you buy youtube music premium services then you will more enjoy, it has all official audios and videos. For Indians, youtube music is highly recomended if you addicted to kpop and pop. Spotify is not good in India don\u2019t waste money for Spotify premium buy youtube premium instead or youtube music premium it is cheaper than Spotify and also you will get google play music for free. It is not a biased review, this is how I experienced.",
