            "answer_text": "You absolutely have to go to at least three piano shops that sell new and second-hand pianos.  You need to play them all - the most expensive grand piano and the cheapest new upright, the most expensive used and the cheapest used. Ignore your budget at this point because you need to get a good idea of what there is. Test them out in the middle, the high notes and the low notes. Play chromatic scales and chords. Look for the softest to the loudest sounds and all the shades in between. Notice how the keys feel to touch and how the go up & down. Is it too light, too stiff, too heavy, too short, etc? Does it have a warm, rich tone, or a bright, loud tone? Does it sound muffled? Does it echo? How long do the notes sound for? What about full chords? Do all the pitches continue together? Which sound do you prefer? Test the pedals. Do they squeak? Are they worn? Do they work? Note that the left pedal on a grand will move the keyboard sideways. The centre pedal should sustain a single note. Don't worry too much about the middle pedal on an upright unless you want to practice quietly. Look at the music stand. Is it wide and deep enough? Is it at a good height and angle? Look at the case. Will it work with your home decor? Will it fit the space? Does it smell OK? (Kind of relevant if it's used). Does it come with a stool? Is the stool adjustable? Can it fit two players? Take note of the brand you are trying. You will notice that Yamahas have a particular sound (fairly bright), Kawaiis are a bit more mellow - both are good - just depends on your preference. German pianos have another tone.  All this research will take a few weeks and should help you determine what you prefer. After that it comes down to bucks. You can get some excellent bargains in the private used market, but you need to know what you want. I recommend find a piano tuner/technician who can check it out and give their appraisal. It is well worth the fee. Like buying a used car. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess what I feel a need to add to this is, piano makers don\u2019t make pianos with one sound or feel. As you go up their product lines, their sound gets more refined and their actions usually get more responsive, refined, and smoother. Some makers are known for high level lines, like say Steinway and Bechstein. There is a base high-quality and you get even more high-quality as you go up in models and price. However, it is different with Kawai and Yamaha. You can get a brash sounding Kawai or Yamaha in the lower to middle range. But as you move up in tiers, the sound gets more refined, less prone to harshness. So, you can\u2019t really say a Kawai has one quality of sound, or Yamaha either. They have a range of qualities of sound. They have their mid-range standards, like Kawai\u2019s K300, K400. But there\u2019s a change when you get to Kawai\u2019s K500 and K800 in terms of sound quality. The K500 and K800 use duplex scaling for example, where the lower models don\u2019t. That affects the sound quality. With Yamaha, you\u2019re more limited in the USA. The standard is the U1 and U3. Solid, reliable pianos that used to be tuned to pop (bright) but have been toned down recently. A \u201cP\u201d or a \u201cB\u201d are not as good. Especially a B. Then you can go as high as YUS5, which is a very nice piano. But you don\u2019t have SE and SU in the USA, and those are the really fine sounding Yamaha uprights. But, they\u2019re expensive. The thing to remember with Kawai and Yamaha is that they make a huge range of pianos that go from budget to competing with Steinway at the highest levels (and price-wise as well). Kawai Piano Pricing Guide (notice, for $10,000 you are getting a middle Kawai, not an upper Kawai upright) Examine tiers in any brand. Their teir systems don\u2019t always work the same way. It depends on how big a range they have in what market range they make pianos for. The sound and feel of the lowest tier may be quite different to the highest tier. And sometimes, a diffferent line may have a different tonal quality with some brands. A simple general X brand has this type of sound will not do. You need to zero in on the model and such. Even with that said, the same models can sound very different depending on the voicing and the prep, and they can feel differently as well. Sometimes it takes playing five or more pianos of the same model to find a really good example of a particular model with any brand. ",
