            "answer_text": "Yes. Absolutely. I don't know what your plans are whilst visiting the island, since many people come here for the party scene and it's rare that a person would go out drinking or clubbing by oneself, but even if you fancied that, you'd be safe. Beware the pickpocketers, that's probably the most common issue. If someone buys you a drink, be careful no one\u2019s trying to spike it with drugs. That's not really an everyday Ibiza thing but that occasionally happens to women all around the world, so just common sense. Ask for someone to look after your bag if you go for a swim at the beach alone. Again, just common sense, extra awareness, I\u2019ve been going to the beaches alone most of the time for the last 3 summers and never had my bag robbed or anything. Don't get into unlicensed taxis, although most of the time it's just seasonal workers who don't have a taxi license trying to make money, but again, I guess a licensed taxi feels safer for a tourist. Lastly, there are some aggressive street sellers that can harass you, just ignore them and don't let them put any bracelets on your wrists etc because they won\u2019t leave you alone and make you pay for that. Have a good time. ",
