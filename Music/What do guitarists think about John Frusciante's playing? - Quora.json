            "answer_text": "When I was growing up in NJ in the 80s , tons of people played guitar. There were always a couple of stoners that could play pretty well and liked the retro 60s and 70s stuff. Frusciante reminds me of one of thise guys, just a bit better. He has two things going for him. He is a good songwriter and he has a sort of specific style \u2014 a vision of how he wants to sound \u2014 even if it isn't super original. He isn't great technically. Nor does he aspire to be. I mean, he is a professional, but nowhere near a virtuoso. He isn't really innovative. He basically sounds like he took Hendrix and 70s funk and mashed it together. Take Dani California for example : I love it, but it is basically a retempoed Tom Petty song with a bolted on, somewhat sloppy, Hendrix solo. So ultimately I enjoy his music, but I feel he is overhyped as a guitar player. ",

            "answer_text": "I actually learned a lot by playing close attention to what he\u2019s playing - and what he\u2019s not playing - on all those great RHCP songs. See, my background as a guitarist, I started out learning Metallica songs and from there I tried to get more and more technical and showy with my playing. Louder, faster, more! As I got older I started looking into more diverse playing styles like blues and classical, just to keep it interesting. So in RHCP, I find this new (to me) concept: playing exactly no more and no less than what the groove calls for. Frusciante is a really talented player but he\u2019s always letting the groove breathe. Maybe it comes from having a guy like Flea playing bass, when you have something good like that you gotta give it room to shine. But whatever the reason, it taught me a more musical approach to composition, using the guitar as a part of a much bigger whole rather than trying to make the guitar the main driver of the song. And sometimes the guitar should be out front but Frusciante has time and time again demonstrated how effective subtlety can be. ",
