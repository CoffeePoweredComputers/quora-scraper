Because I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.I fear no evil because I'm blind.I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soulBut I know when I die my soul is damned. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest many songs from the video games I love get stuck in your head (yes now I can even sing in chaos language from nier and nier automata) But I would have to say the most catchy songs I've listened to are the ones from Persona 5 and Bayonetta, for which I recommend \u201clast surprise\u201d and \u201cwhims of fate\u201d from persona 5 and \u201cmysterious destiny\" and \u201ctomorrow is mine\u201d from bayonetta 1 and 2. Yes they get stuck in your head, but in a toe tapping fun kinda way. They shall live on in my phone ringtones for it ",
