            "answer_text": "Yamaha R1 is a more \u201cpractical\u201d motorcycle.. The bike is used in super-bike championships, that\u2019s how this bike is good. To be specific, the Hayabusa is heavier by 66 kg, has a longer wheelbase by 75mm and has lesser ground clearance. To be very honest the bike doesn\u2019t look good too! That might be my perspective though. What isn\u2019t a perspective, is that it handles bad and is meant for straights and top speed. The Suzuki bike that can rival the R1 is the GSX-R1000. They share proper racing dynamics and go head to head in timed event. Hope that helps. ",
