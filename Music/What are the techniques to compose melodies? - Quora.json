            "answer_text": "For many years I had the problem of coming up with really good short melodies, like four bars long or shorter, but never anything longer. This made composing difficult, because it forced my music to be very dense with ideas, which to many listeners translates to a higher level of anxiety expressed through the music. A couple key realizations helped me to begin writing longer melodies.  Melodies are like sentences. If you start with a sentence that does fine by itself, the way to make it longer is not to add more ideas onto the end: that produces a run on. Rather, add subordinate clauses. Often, that means taking a four bar idea and deleting or postponing the final resolution, inserting in its place variations on the idea that leave the resolution incomplete. This allows a four bar idea to be stretched out into a longer melody made up of many phrases. In many cases, I will through this process generate several variations on the melody that I can use at different points throughout a composition.Let things be as long as they need to be, but no longer. If I start with music that is composed of many regular, eight bar kind of phrases, I often experiment with adding and subtracting beats. I find that comparing the more irregular results to the original, the original begins to seem breathless and therefore mechanical compared to the new version. Repetition should always have a rhetorical purpose. If I find myself repeating phrases of music just to round out a regular eight bar phrase structure, I almost always cut the repetition, to the benefit of the music. People don't speak in eight bar 4/4 phrases. Similarly, if you find your melodies leading you to time signature changes and 7 or 9 bar phrases, you may be doing something right by allowing the melody to breathe. Naturally, all this depends on taste, and it may be less appropriate in groove driven styles; nonetheless it can be done in such music, and is worth considering.Sing everything. Melody, bass line, inner voices. If you can't sing it, chances are it isn't a good melody. Obviously this is not universally true, but breaking away from singable melodies is something that one should do only after one is confident in one's melodic writing.The gesture should always be clear. Is the melody ascending? Is it outlining a triad? Is it ornamenting a particular note or interval? See Modal frame. In many cases, clarifying one's thinking about the large scale gesture can help in revising a weak melody, by leading one to cut extraneous elements that do not contribute to that gesture. For example, if the gesture of a melody is supposed to be a descending run in sixteenth notes, having too many ascending notes would weaken the effect of the melody. This type of thinking is often helpful in revising counterpoint, harmony, and orchestration as well. In many cases, an unsuccessful passage is caused by writing too many contradictory gestures at the same time.Write music that phrases itself. Good musicians can make \"Three Blind Mice\" sound expressive, but composers often do not have the luxury of working with excellent performers, and even when they do, those performers may have very little rehearsal time or just put less into playing a new piece than they would into Brahms. Therefore, writing music that phrases itself even when played poorly greatly contributes to the success of one's performances. This is absolutely essential if one intends to write for high school musicians or younger. How does one do this? Think about how you want a melody to be phrased. Is there a crescendo into a note? Is there a little pause or lift? Is a particular note lighter or heavier? In what way are the notes connected? All of these things can be exaggerated by clever orchestration and melodic writing. If you want a pause after a note, why not change the time signature and add a rest? would that make it easier to play or more difficult? Rather than writing a fortepiano-crescendo, have one instrument attack the note and another play the crescendo.Good melodies imply harmony. This is true even for unaccompanied melodies. It need not be obvious to anyone but the composer what the specific chord is under a note, but if you can't hear the chords that your own melody is suggesting, you may need to work on how you generate pitch material for your melodies. I find that it helps me to think in chromatic movable-do solfege, because ri and me have completed different harmonic connotations. Always be specific about spelling! Spelling is how we communicate the grammar of music.Good melodies are hospitable. A good melody will always allow the addition of another strong countermelody. Likewise good two voice counterpoint allows the addition of a strong third voice. Etc.I find that reserving certain melodic gestures to happen on certain pitch levels, while transposing other gestures freely, creates a sense of tonal space, structure, and motion. Freely transposing all materials ends up seeming aimless, because listeners have no reference to keep their bearings. Needless to say, not transposing anything can just get boring.Motives with strong gestural profile are important, because they maintain their aural identity as they are developed and modified. Even if they lose their original pitch and rhythmic makeup altogether, if the profile is strong, the original gesture will remain audible. Motives with strong profile also hold their own better in contrapuntal treatment, because they are easier to hear in inner voices or through an intricate texture. Using motives with strong profile makes orchestration much easier, because one does not need to rely on weight of sound to differentiate foreground and background.Composition instruction traditionally makes much of motivic unity and techniques for motivic development and combination. Pitch class and interval set techniques have also become widely used in all styles of music, to great effect. I don't have much to add to these techniques, as they have been discussed in great depth by others. I completely agree as to their importance, and I merely mean to add some other ideas that I think are also important. The importance of score study of the masters cannot be overstated. If you want to write great melodies, learn how the melodies you love are put together. ",

            "answer_text": "Context is everything -- a good melody is something that's sensitive to what's happening around it, which is what makes it sound good to begin with.   Let's say a saxophone is improvising a melody over the bass and the piano -- a good player would create a melody that makes the rest of the parts sound integral to what's happening in the foreground.  A poor player will just wail away, playing whatever they feel like which will make them sound \"out of place\" with the rest of the music.  Cohesion is what gives melodies that \"smoothness\" that makes its lines seem so natural and pleasing.  Even if you're doing it in written form, a lot of the same principals still apply. Sounds complicated?  That's because it is, and it's a lot harder than it looks.  There's no right or wrong way of doing it and getting better just takes a lot of practice and listening to what's going on around you.  It's not about writing what you think sounds good, but what sounds good in context. But if you're looking for techniques, there's a few pointers you can use from doing counterpoint exercises, which I highly recommend learning about if you're interested in improving your melodic writing skills.  Here's a few things that make for a traditionally \"good\" melody: Step-wise Motion Assuming you want the audience to be able to follow where your melodies are going, you probably want to use a lot of \"step-wise\" motion, minimizing the amount of leaps and jumps that you make.  This will help make your transitions from note to note a smoother one. Occasional Jumps But just doing everything in steps can get pretty boring after a while, so occasionally you'll probably want to throw in a jump here and there just to make it interesting.  If you take a leap down, though, make sure you follow it up with step-wise motion going upwards and visa versa.  Too many leaps make the melody sound disjointed, but by counteracting it with steps in the opposite direction you can help make it sound more interesting without losing its sense of balance. Interesting Contours Melodies that just go up up up or down down down like a scale becomes linear, predictable and boring because there's no element of surprise.  It should have contours that go up and down, making it exciting for people to hear.  Keep it smooth, but nonetheless unpredictable. Climax There should be a \"high point\" in the contour of the melody in order to simulate a climax of that particular line.  Consider it the \"peak of the mountain\" for that melody.  (If the highest note on the melody is a high-C then there should only be one, in other words.)  Traditionally, this sits around 2/3rds or 3/4ths of the way through the line. Varying Harmonic Content This one's kind of hard to explain in words, but say there's 7 notes in the key that you're writing a melody that's 8 bars long.  On the \"strong\" beats (1st and 3rd) you might try to emphasize different notes of the scale because it'll give the impression that you \"made the most\" out of the notes that were available to you.  In the example above, you could, for instance, land on every note of the scale at the beginning of each bar, finally landing back on the original note at the end.  This is more or less subjective and these \"rules\" don't always make sense to use, but it helps to keep in mind that if you emphasize different areas of the key you're more likely to get a fuller, \"richer\" sounding melody in the end. Counterpoint exercises usually have you start with 8 bar exercises that make you write \"melodies\" with 8 whole notes first, using the techniques above.  If you get good at it, you can then break it down into half-notes and try to do the same.  Then quarters, eighths, and so on.  It helps to have a teacher while you're doing all of this, because at least in the beginning, you want someone to be a hard-ass and make sure you're doing it right with the simple stuff before you start adding more complicated rhythms into the mix. You can always break the rules if you want, but having this background will give you the means of justifying it later on.  It's a good thing to know, either way. ",
