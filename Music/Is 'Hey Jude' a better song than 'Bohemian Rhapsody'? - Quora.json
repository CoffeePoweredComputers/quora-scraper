            "answer_text": "Yes. Hey jude was written by Paul McCartney as a song to help Julian Lennon cope with his parents divorce. It's one of the most beautiful songs ever written and still stands the test of time. Every time it plays everyone around joins in. No other song brings people together like that Bohemian rhapsody was written by Freddie Mercury and I've heard multiple times and still I think of it as just a bunch of noise. I think alot of other queen songs are better not just to listen to but far better written. It's a cool song to listen to once or twice but other than that it just gets annoying. The lyrics don't go anywhere and the music is eh. Everything impressive about the song was done 10 years earlier. Now today with that stupid movie people think queen is the greatest band of all time. they have nothing that qualifies them for that. They were another rock band that had a good vocalist. The bands that are superior i songwriting, influence, and popularity deserve it more. Was Queen a good band? yes. Do they have anything on the Beatles, Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink floyd, or the Eagles? No. The movie was nowhere near as good as people say it is. Alot of the story wasnt accurate the only saving grace about it was Rami Maleks incredible performance. ",

            "answer_text": "They both are at par,both are nostalgic but as a 21st century kid,i feel like hey jude is better in terms of lyrics but on the other hand bohemian rhapsody music has so much more to offer,it has the best music ever in a song and can be fitted in wide range of music from different genre,from opera to rock. Hey Jude is one of the best lyrically written song along with Stairway to heaven while Bohemian Rhapsody is the best musically written song ever. Both of the songs give a chillin relief from every wear and tear of modern world,and make us to lead pre ninety\u2019s life which was much more simpler.Both of these songs are very different from the music that we listen now which is all about sex,moneywhich i think is because they are from pre jackson era,and michael was great but people now just bring way much \u201csexy\u201d content dance music,club bangers,boy bands etc. ",
