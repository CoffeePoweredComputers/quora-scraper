            "answer_text": "K-pop idol trainees? No. They don\u2019t get paid anything. If anything, they\u2019re in debt. Let me explain how the K-pop system works: Companies recruit good-looking boys and girls to train to become an idol. For most of these people, it\u2019s a life-long dream! Sadly, some of them don\u2019t know about the consequences. First, you sign a contract that tells you how many years you\u2019ll train and how the system works. You train every day for at least 12 hours, you won\u2019t see your family, you won\u2019t meet your friends and sometimes, the company will tell you to not eat anything in order to lose weight because if you\u2019re over 50kg you will be considered fat. And then you debut! Finally, all of your training has paid off! But do you get paid? Stop dreaming about it! You have to pay off your debt. What debt? Oh, since the company paid for you to live and train, any money you make will go towards the company until you\u2019ve paid off your debt, IF you make enough money at first. Some idols have actually made money and then some since they earned enough money to pay their debt as well as keep some for themselves. BTS, BigBang and Blackpink are some good examples. Trainees don\u2019t get paid, but idols and artists do. Enjoy the quarantine, Eni <3 ",

            "answer_text": "If it's a legitimate company, you pay no money. No money at all. If someone approaches you with an offer to become a trainee for a certain amount of money, RUN. It is going to be a scam. The only circumstance where you have to pay for your time as a trainee would be if you ghosted on your company. This means that you received their training, ate their food, and stayed at their dorms, but left without fulfilling your contract (for example, you left the company after a year even though your contract stated you'd be a trainee there for two years). In this case, it's reasonable \u2014 obviously, since you're the one that broke the mutual agreement with the company and used their resources. If any of you do become trainees, remember to choose your contracts wisely. It's best to sign a 2 year contract (I think this is the shortest contract offered at any company), because at that point you'll have seen your own growth as a trainee and maybe even got news of a possible debut. Or, maybe you'll have found by the end of those two years that the whole idol thing isn't for you, and then you can leave without any repercussions. Remember, any company that asks you to pay to become a trainee is probably not a real company. It's a scam. Don't fall for it. ",
