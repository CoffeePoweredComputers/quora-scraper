            "answer_text": "There are two answers right now, one didn\u2019t understand the question (not sure what they\u2019re talking about asking how you\u2019ll ever make money from registering and distribution\u2026) and the other was almost complete but not quite. The moment your music is recorded or written down a copyright exists. Distributing it on a platform like Distrokid has nothing to do with assigning copyright but it does help establish a date after which if somebody were to infringe on your copyright you could say clearly \u2018I own this music - I uploaded it to distrokid on <date>\u2019 You OWN the copyright just by creating the music and putting it into a fixed and tangible form (eg sing it out loud and it\u2019s no copyright, write or record it and there is). The song is one copyright the sound recording of the specific song is a second copyright. You can officially make money from the recording itself (distrokid) and anybody else recording your song or using it in a movie, tv show, etc. Registering the copyright with the library of Congress has nothing to do with exploiting the copyright (eg making money). You do, however, need to register to PROTECT the copyright - that is if someone infringes on your copyright and you want to sue them you must first have registered it to bring the lawsuit. You do not have to register the song and recording separately - to establish both just look for form SR on the library of Congress website - I suggest doing full releases (album or EP) together as the same protection is added to all parts and it\u2019s all one fee.
