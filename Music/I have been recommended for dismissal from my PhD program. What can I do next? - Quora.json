            "answer_text": "Well, if they give you a MS degree for what work you have done, you can go out and work (or teach in community colleges, or in private high schools), for a few years and go back and finish your PhD at a school that requires a MS or MA degree as a prerequisite. That is what I did. I went out with my MS degree in Chemistry, and worked in industry for a while, went back to school and earned a MDiv degree in another subject to learn to write and speak (I needed to learn to communicate better to people of a variety of backgrounds) better. Then I got into teaching at the High School and Community College level, then I got a lecturer position and started grad school again at age 49, and finally earned my PhD at age 53. NO regrets now. Give yourself a break and work for a while, maybe you might meet someone working and marry and have a family, then go back and finish when they are in college or high school. It is NOT the end of the world, even though it seems like it. One school I left my PhD with no degree and all and switched grad schools, because my adviser was a last minute one who did not like me, and told me I should see a psychiatrist because I did not know how to do research in his estimation (he did not want to teach me how really). So, I found another grad school in my area across the country that would accept me, and finished my MS in 3 years total. The second one also made me stop with just a MS, because I had too many outside distractions, I needed to find someone and get married and have a family. I even cried (in my apartment off campus) when I heard the news (and I am a guy), but now looking back, yeah they were right! I had no desire to work 60 hours per week in the lab, and my \u201cgirl troubles\u201d were too distracting. I was in my mid 20s and was too distracted by personal matters, I needed to get married and have a family first, and then when our sons went to college, I started grad school again. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to stay in grad school, you should appeal - that's what the process is for. Strengthen your hand by talking to your immediate advisers. Nothing says 'grad student will fail' like keeping it all to yourself and never talking to them. As for personal issues, they suck, but few places that pay as poorly as grad school will care about it. If you have a counselling service at the school you could use that. Ultimately a PhD lasts longer than the average marriage, and cannot be approached with half-hearted enthusiasm with expectations of success. You have to prioritize your resources as you see best fit.
