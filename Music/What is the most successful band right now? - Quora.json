            "answer_text": "If your asking regarding Boy Band then it's gotta be BTS regarding all genres.. If only English pop then you can say it's \u20185 Seconds Of Summer\u2019 or \u2018Coldplay\u2019. And if it's regarding a girl group then it's gotta be BlackPink or Twice regarding all genres or if only English pop is considered then it has got to be Little Mix (dude you gotta hear their new single - Woman like me) or it can also be our dear Fifth Harmony! It's definitely The South Korean Pop group BTS. It is so because they have been trainees since before 2013 and debuted at 2015. They weren't that popular before but due to their wide use of social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, V Live, etc.. They have reached to many foreign fans. This a known fact that they weren't that popular in South Korea even after their debut due to their band name, BANGTAN SONYEONDAN, meaning in English- Bulletproof Boys scouts. But as Armies (as their fans are called) in Korea came to know about their popularity in foreign countries.. They joined in to cheer too. Another reason would be the prefection in the band members choreographies in their music videos and above all their so called \u2018proportional faces\u2019.. And most importantly their ability to write such beautiful songs and at the same transform them into beautiful songs with totally different style and catch which haven't been produced before(rarely) by the artists at all. Most importantly they also hold fan meetings in Korea which goes on a whole new level for the fans to meet their oppas (Saranghaeo ). Before hand One Direction used to be the biggst boy band but now as they have disbanded BTS has taken the lead!! ",

And in case you don\u2019t know the Beatles, just Google, watch Youtube or listen to the Beatles\u2019 channel on Sirius radio. And there are many books written about the Fab Four. And many tribute bands who look and sound like the Beatles. Or, catch a Paul McCartney concert or a Ringo Starr concert, with his All Stars. ",
