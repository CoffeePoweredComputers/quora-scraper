            "answer_text": "Absolutely. And at the same time, not at all. I undoubtedly believe that Hip Hop music, which is one of the most prevalent aspects of Music & Hip Hop Culture (though certainly not the only influential one), is here to stay! \u2026Kinda, I\u2019ll get back to this (Though it should be a little obvious). So much of the American culture itself is derived from, tied to & dependent upon the happenings of Hip Hop music & Hip Hop culture. Here are some sources showing how Hip Hop is defining its place as a pillar in our society: 3 Areas Of Society Hip-Hop Culture Will Dominate By 2020 How Hip-Hop Music Has Influenced American Culture and Society Hip Hop: A Positive & Generous Force In Our Society Music, in general, has an uncanny ability to move, inspire, & save many people. I am one of many who would assert, without question, that Hip Hop music has invariably saved my life. Hip Hop music empowers generations of marginalized, oppressed, & once voiceless people; to speak up & tell their story. It allows us to articulate our experiences in rhythm & rhyme, usually encouraging a level of vulnerability we were never allowed, or never able to experience. It connects with the youth in profound ways. Hip Hop music, emboldened & bolstered by the Hip Hop Culture that birthed it, is becoming a worldwide, universal language of sorts. A mode of expression, that is far more accessible than other musical genres. It has no rules that say how you can or can\u2019t express with it. Because of this, creative & inspiring people are using the art form to teach, to help commit complex academic curriculum into easily digestible bites of lyrical knowledge. This is just one of the many reasons I believe that Hip Hop will be around for far longer than people anticipate. Now, to address the \u201cnot at all\u201d & \u201ckinda\u201d statements \u2014 nothing is here to stay. Everything as we know it is impermanent. Life is fragile & humans are fallible. Change is the only constant. Centuries, decades, or perhaps even a bit sooner than that\u2026 the world as we know it, won\u2019t even be recognizable. Cultural traditions will evolve & take a new form. Musical styles will be an eclectic synthesis of styles reminiscent to older times, or perhaps, so far removed through many iterations, that we can\u2019t even pinpoint its roots. Should Hip Hop withstand that test of time, I would be truly elated. However, I accept that nothing is permanent, & change is the only constant. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A\u2026 Yes, though it depends on what you mean by \u201chip hop music\u201d and \u201chere to stay.\u201d There is an incredible variety of hip hop out there and, interestingly enough, most sub-genres are still being produced to this day; in some cases because the artist(s) who invented/popularized that sub-genre are still producing material (The Lox with the gritty boom-bap or A Tribe Called Quest with quirky, jazz and sample-laden Afrocentric hip hop) and in some cases because cats are just content to ride historical styles to success (like J Cole thinking he invented lyricism- sorry, had to get that Cole dig in there). Now, trap is certainly the dominant sound in today\u2019s (American) pop culture. Even truck commercials feature that characteristic hi-hat and 808 kick. That\u2019s actually probably an indication that trap is on its way out as the dominant style, though it will probably take a few years and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s next. Maybe even a style not born from hip hop? I don\u2019t think it will ever go away but hip hop might not always dominate the pop landscape as it has for the past 20\u201330 years. One thing that makes hip hop so prevalent is it\u2019s accessibility of creation. Technology has made all forms of music more accessible to create but hip hop remains most accessible because you really only need a Digital Audio Workstation and a mic (no musical instruments, specialized training, collaborators, etc needed- though all of these things can help) to make a rap record. Heck, to go really simple with it, you only need a beat (by record, 808, human beat-box, etc) and something to say. I don\u2019t see this changing and I believe it\u2019s accessibility will continue to be a key component of its popularity. Hip hop has also indelibly left its mark on most other musical genres. From instrumentation to rhythm to vocal cadences and even lyrical themes and slang, every popular music genre owes something to hip hop in this day and age (yes, even country\u2026 especially country). So, hip hop is here to stay though it will continue to evolve and may not always be at the forefront of pop culture (just like rock\u2019n\u2019roll!). ",
