            "answer_text": "Before I answer this I would like to ask clarification first about the question..when you said \u2018flirt\u2019 do you mean it as a negative one like a synonym of s*ut or flirt in a way that she is close to her co member..if it is the latter then I will answer it according to my utmost knowledge about Blackpink.. As I watched Blackpink house (BP reality series) and vlive videos of BP I observed that among the member Lisa is the most clingy person in the group she is even labaled as \u2018Lisa oppa\u2019 because of her caring acts towards her unnies and eventhough the older members tease her she will just laugh about it and even voted by the members as the most savage among the four of them. But if it is the first one then let me tell you this..BP may wear revealing dresses but it doesn\u2019t sum it up who they are and as an idol they need to look good to suit the cooncept of their videos (YG style) and in the eyes of their fans those dresses make them look sexily elegant rather than a flirt ",
