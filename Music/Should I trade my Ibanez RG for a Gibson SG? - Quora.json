            "answer_text": "SGs are quite versatile guitars and Gibsons in general have good quality control, but I wouldn't get an SG simply because a guitarist you admire plays one. Have you played an SG? Does it suit your playing style? Is it comfortable to play? How does the neck feel - do you like the thickness of it, the thickness of the frets, the scale length (space between the frets) and radius (curvature of the fretboard)? Do you use a vibrato bar, and if so, would you prefer an SG with a Bigsby or a Vibrola system? There are a lot of things to consider. I think it's hard to go wrong with an SG as they are good all-around, versatile guitars, but there are other guitars that would suit you just as well or possibly better such as Guilds, DeArmonds, PRSs, various Les Pauls and semi-hollowbody guitars, or even humbucker-equipped Fenders (I mention humbucking guitars as you're a fan of metal and Black Sabbath, but don't entirely rule out single coil or P-90/P-100 equipped guitars - you'd be surprised at what you can coax out of guitars not specifically designed for metal or hard rock with the right distortion and EQ pedals). There are also different kinds of SGs apart from the official Gibson models - Epiphones, obviously, but also various other copies (the Japanese-made ones tend to be the best; it's hard to go wrong with a Tokai) and variants on the original SG design. It sounds like you're not happy with your Ibanez RG, so selling it to fund a new guitar seems like the right way to go, but only you'll know what's best for you when it comes to choosing that new guitar. $800 is a good budget to work with and the SG is a good starting point, but definitely try out several different ones (one guitar will vary from the next, so avoid ordering online if possible and make sure to play different ones - even of the same exact model - if your local guitar store carries several of them) as well as other guitars such as the ones I mentioned. Keep an open mind and don't rule out certain things without trying them out first; you may be surprised at what you wind up liking the most. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite what others here have said, this really boils down to 1 thing, the frets. Do you like the crowned frets and thin neck of the Ibanez? Does it feel smooth? Do you do lots of bends and vibrato? If you do vibrato and bends quite frequently, or if you are a rhythm player, you may find the SG more comfortable due to the flat fret tops. It will create less tension in your fingers are you play and give you a more solid feel when doing chords. If you're a lead player and you value a smooth, fast neck the most, then the Ibanez is probably the thing to stick with once you fix the crappy EMG installation job that the original owner did. TL;DR, Gibson SG = Flat frets, Ibanez = Crowned (Rounded) frets ",
