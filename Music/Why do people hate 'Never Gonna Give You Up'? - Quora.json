            "answer_text": "It is one of those songs that is so bad that it becomes good, a bit like an Ed Wood movie. I remember the first time I heard it. I couldn\u2019t believe how awful it was. Rick Astley had such a dull voice that grated on me. The lyrics seemed so trite: \u201cNever gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye, never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.\u201d Yeah, right\u2014these romance songs are so full of promises that no one ever keeps. The beat felt forced, the song seemed to lack any musicality, and I found myself wondering how anyone could tolerate it. Now I admit I like the song. I don\u2019t love it, but I find it reassuring and comforting, like a bowl of Cream of Wheat. That chorus epitomizes heartbreak and betrayal. There is real cleverness in such language as people with trust issues want what the song is promising to do: never get let down, deserted, abandoned, deceived or hurt in any way. As people pursue relationships, they realize that Rick Astley is granting the golden goose of perfection\u2014no pain and infinite gain. Really, these are kind lyrics, and it is nice to know that someone is willing to sing about good intentions toward another. I still think the song isn\u2019t technically musical, but I have danced to it and I am not ashamed. I even listen to it some mornings when I\u2019m in a bad mood, and it cheers me up as I get ready for work. There is an innocence to the song that some people may find cloying. But it does grow on the listener. It may take a few years or even a couple of decades, but it becomes listenable and fun. I actually thought the song had found a resurgence. But I do sympathize with those who loathe it as I was one. Now it makes me smile. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Hate\" is a strong word. In my case, \"dislike\" is probably more accurate. When the song first burst onto the charts I was put off by its general cheesiness and the heavily synthesised beat and bassline. Not that I mind synth-based music, I just felt this wasn't done very well. With hindsight, I grew to loathe the song even more because it marked the beginning of the end for me as far as chart music was concerned: It heralded the dawn of the Stock Aitken Waterman era and things seemed to deteriorate irredeemably from there. I eventually stopped listening to the radio around the year 2000 but Never Gonna Give You Up and Kylie's I Should Be So Lucky are the two songs I associate with the start of the downslide. Btw, I'm a lot more mellowed out about these things now and I accept that musical trends come and go; also that these changes are not good or bad in any objective sense and neither is my taste any better or worse than anyone else. One final point: Astley has a fantastic voice. It's the songs I disliked, not his vocals. ",
