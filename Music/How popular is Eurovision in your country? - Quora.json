            "answer_text": "I\u2019m from Switzerland, and until last year the situation was like this: The ratings were quite good, better than the average Saturday night show, but comments on social media and online articles were mostly negative, like \u201cWhy do we even bother taking part of this, if we never qualify for the final anyway?\u201d (Maybe we should try sending better songs \u2026) \u201cEven when we sent DJ Bobo in 2007 (who was very famous in Europe back then), he didn\u2019t qualify\u201d (Have you listened to the song, it\u2019s not very good, is it?) \u201cBut it\u2019s so political anyway\u201d (What does that even mean?) \u201cEastern countries give each other points, so we have no chance\u201d (Ahem, the majority of the winners since 2009 are from western Europe \u2026) \u201cBut it\u2019s so expensive\u201d (it\u2019s not much more expensive than producing our own four-hour entertainment show) \u201cOur commentator is so bad\u201d (He\u2019s a bit plain, but definitely not bad. Besides, you can watch it on German or Austrian television, surely you\u2019ll find a good commentator.) Thankfully, we finally produced a 4th-place entry this year, so a lot of this complaining is now obsolete. It will be interesting to see how it develops. ",

            "answer_text": "I come from Australia, and we, oh we just LOVE the Eurovision Song Contest. Mainly because most of us come from Europe and our grandfathers and grandmothers have watched it. This whole love story between Eurovision and Australia started in 1983, three years after Channel 0/28 (now SBS) started up. SBS, instead of broadcasting programs similar to the programs on other Australian channels at that time, broadcast programs from around the world, some of them in different languages. Anyways, in that year, SBS broadcast the 1983 contest in Munich delayed. I guess they figured that people on the other side of the world were watching them, so they read this message at the start of the program: \u201cAnd a special welcome to our viewers in Australia\u201d. Ever since then, millions of people have tuned in onto SBS to watch what\u2019s going on over in the other side of the globe. In 1987, it kinda went up a notch. Johnny Logan won Eurovision \u201987 in Brussels, and in case you didn\u2019t know, he\u2019s from Australia. So the people watching the contest in Ozm must have felt pretty proud. Then we switched it up AGAIN. From 1983 onwards, SBS would either broadcast the show with no commentary, or they would use the BBC\u2019s tape, which features the voice of Terry Wogan. But, one year after the new millennium, SBS sent Effie Coustas to Copenhagen\u201901 to co-host alongside Terry Wogan in the booth. Two years later, Des Mangan took full advantage of the commentary for Riga \u201903 and Istanbul \u201804. I think by then, people already realized Australia was watching them, so these Australian flags started popping up in the arena in 2007. Then Julia Zemiro was sent by SBS to commentate Belgrade \u201808. The next year (Moscow \u201809), Sam Pang was sent alongside Julia to commentate. It was like this up until Kyiv \u201817, two years after Australia made its debut in Vienna \u201815. Julia and Sam stepped down and were replaced by Joel Creasey and Myf Warhurst. They\u2019ve been commentating ever since. In conclusion, Australia, we just love Eurovision. ",
