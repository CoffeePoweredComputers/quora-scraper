            "answer_text": "I honestly don't know and it may surprise people, but I think I'm the same - because when I look at a piece of art, stylised item or anything decorative - I glance at the work and immediately my mind starts to wonder about the artist. I can guarantee that is what happens with me, I've visited some fabulous sculpture parks and especially when there are numerous pieces by the same artist, I start to look at the creations they've left, like they are all puzzle pieces - \u201cwhat is the mind, that created such things?\u201d I know the \u201cwhy\u201d bit, only an artist with a fever and obsession to create can ever understand. It is the passion, the passion to move earth, shape dirt, form patterns, it all comes from a chaos inside the artist. It is a universal language and it writes in stone, glass, wool, wood, nail polish, fine arts, treen, metal - as many fabrics as there are, there is always an artistic mind that enda up securing their use Everything made, from the mind or with the hands of a person - it is all \u201ccreative\u201d - some people believe in god's, I believe in a creative force, you can stick all of that \u201cgood and evil\u201d business, all that matters is that we tap in to this energy. Indeed, for the sake of our own sanities, we live in a world we cannot control - all we can control is our means to produce. Whenever we make something from nothing, (ie if we can source a material and shape it with our hands) we are adding value. If we can make money from our own creative pursuits then and only then can we be \u201cfree\u201d to own the modes of production. The proletarian become its own beourgoise and all in our own time, with materials of our choice and the skills we develop whilst doing so. I see \u201ccreativity\u201d as a means to be free from the 9\u20135 work machine. It is worse now than ever before because employers can enslave us into living in a shift rotation pattern \u201caccording to the needs of the company\u201d - that system destroys sleep patterns and is so bad for people who want social lives or have responsibility. It turns life into a treadmill and we wish the weekdays away so that we might get time to live during weekends. Because that is pretty much all we are left with \u201cthe remains of the day\u201d and that was a fucking depressing film. I don't have a life like that. I don't want a life like that, I did it for a while and worked 70 hours a week for a salary. Never again. And there aren't many people who dare to be so bold as to create mere aesthetics, as though we are just playing with twigs and dirt\u2026 until some final \u201cproduct\" emerges from a mountain of sawdust. I didn't make an educated decision in my choice to be \u201can artist\u201d - not at all\u2026 I just see faces in wood, and I like to emphasise them by using hand chisels! It's not like work to me. Work is doing shit you don't enjoy at a time that is inconvenient. Yeah, well it doesn't have to be - we are just conditioned into thinking it does. And that is what I appreciate about art: the rebel spirit of artists who dare to not conform to mundanity. It isn't easy. I've had bailiffs hammering in my door - I tapped harder with mallet to drown out the noise. I didn't do what I was supposed to, I never answered the door - I managed to make things because I was defiant enough to ignore everything else. I don't think it was luck, that landed me on my feet with learning how to produce saleable art work - I sweated blood and tears and worked as a slave to the obsession \u201cto create\u201d - I ignored all expectations. I devised my own and it was fortunate that people found my work appealing. But that isn't why I did it. I didn't create any thing that I wanted to sell, I enjoyed the satisfaction that I felt seeing them in a completed state. They reminded me that it could be done, and no matter how hard a particular timber was, it showed me there would be a finish. I wouldn't be stuck working on one piece foooorrreeeeever. But back to the question and away from madness: I do not get moved by pieces of artwork either, I am moved by the passion and determination that it takes to create and complete a piece. Art is a snapshot into the mind of an artist, it provokes that unfathomable question \u201cwhat provoked a person to retreat more towards their own inward visions, than show interest in the outside world?\u201d If I hadn't been \u201cdiscovered\u201d or offered the opportunity to make money from my own \u201cart\u201d - it wouldn't of mattered to me. ALL that mattered to me was that my chisels were sharp and i wasn't bothered about a roof overhead, as much as I cared about whether there was enough light. I felt free. That is my version of \u201cperfect freedom\u201d that was what mattered. The fact that other people wanted to buy my work, certainly made life easier. Maybe you are more of a creator, than an \u201cappreciator\u201d - I think the two get nurtured by one another\u2026 I appreciate others work, because I know what it takes to create - it may well come in some obscure forms, there's no accounting for taste. One man's trash is another man's treasure, Or to quote Oscar Wilde \u201cone man's poetry is another man's poison\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The myth that art has to move people emotionally is just that, a myth. Emotions that people feel are often just them being tricked by what they think they genuinely have come to feel on their own when in actuality it\u2019s often what society has told them they should feel. Maybe you just aren\u2019t easily tricked into being as emotionally manipulated as many people. I\u2019m an artist and often my mother used to take me to museums when I was a child, and she would walk near me and gasp at paintings and say in my ear \u201cISN\u2019T IT BEAUTIFUL!?\u201d And it would anger me. I wanted to be allowed to have my own reactions, feelings, and thoughts, and I felt like she was just reacting to what she what she felt like she was told she was supposed to feel like. I had different opinions about which pieces of art were or were not beautiful, and wanted to be able to make those decisions on my own without her shoving what I considered to be her very pedestrian opinions down my throat. I still believe that most people don\u2019t have very original thoughts or feelings and just think that they love Monet because they\u2019re told that they should. As an adult I worked at art museums and these middle class older women would line up around the block for the Impressionism exhibition every year, then stand and gasp in front of the same boring paintings of water lillies and boating parties. How dull to live an entire life just filled with emotions that other people tell you to have. You\u2019re an individual and at least you\u2019re not doing as others tell you to. ",
