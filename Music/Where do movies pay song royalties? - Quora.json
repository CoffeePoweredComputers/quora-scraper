            "answer_text": "Persons in charge of music for films are known as music supervisors. Their responsibilities include, but not limited to, managing budgets for music uses in a film, administration of scoring, and acquiring music for a film. When a music supervisor wants to use a song for a film, they typically reach out to the publisher. The publisher controls and administers the rights to the music and negotiates with the music supervisor a synch license - a license that the copyright owner (the publisher in the case of major label artists; in the case of independent artists, the songwriter) gives to the music supervisor to use the music in the film. The synch license is a flat fee that is part of the music supervisor\u2019s budget (which in some cases can be negotiated). Publishing royalties (otherwise known as residuals) are paid out or any subsequent airing, including DVD release, broadcast TV syndication and new media use such as Netflix streaming. The valuation of residuals takes into account the amount of time spent on the production, the type of production and the market in which the production appears (e.g. TV, DVD, new media). All of these are paid to the publisher who then pays the artist (or again, in the case of an indie artist, these payments go directly to the artist). ",

            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t pay royalties. They buy sync licenses from either the Publisher or Harry Fox Agency in NYC. It\u2019s a one time payment to license a single song in a single movie. The sync license usually extends to DVDs of the movie. The license is generally negotiated by the producers of the film and the lawyers of the publishing company. When it goes to TV the producers have to provide a listing of all music, name of composer and publisher, time and if it\u2019s featured or background, vocal or instrumental. Then the TV reports this to ASCAP and BMI who pay the publisher and songwriters based on the log sheet information. ",
