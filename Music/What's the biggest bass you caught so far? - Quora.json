            "answer_text": " 10lb+ (she bottomed out my 10lb scale) About 18 years ago, I was fishing on Pinto Point, San Pablo Reservoir in San Pablo, Ca. My family and I were targeting planted Rainbow Trout. But being a bass fisherman, I always bring some bass fishing gear with me whenever I\u2019m fishing in freshwater. Once I got my family\u2019s rods setup with powerbait and strike indicators, I decided to take a look in the adjacent cove to see if there were any fish on their spawning bed. Sure enough, I saw a mated pair protecting their nest. As typical, the buck was much smaller, but more aggressive than the hen. He acted like a Cam Chancellor roving the back field just waiting to clobber some poor receiver. Every time I made a splashless cast to the bed, the buck would make a mad dash to the lure and crush it. I tried larger lures and smaller. I didn\u2019t set the hook on his attack. Instead, I free-lined the spool, and waited from him to drop the lure before I retrieved it. Often, the female made a move towards the lure, but the male always beat her to it. That dinky, little male, full of testosterone and LDS (Little Dick Syndrome), macking on the biggest most beautifulest gal on this side of the pond, determined to rule his roost. He bumped his queen away from my offering then crushed the lure time and time again. And every time, the hen would just backed away from her suiter, letting him have his way with my intruder. I fought the urge to set the hook on that male. When my cast wasn\u2019t a perfect, splashless presentation, she\u2019d bolt to the deeper waters. So she was already a bit spooked. If I set the hook on the male, there\u2019d be a chance that she\u2019d disappear forever. This went on for at least an hour. Finally, I pitched a 1/16oz, black with blue flake Gitzit onto the bed. As I tapped the gravel bedding using my right hand with the Gitzit, I waited for the buck to make his move. As he came in to attack the lure, I readied my second rod with a smoke/blue flake, dropshot worm. As soon as the male picked up the Gitzit, I put the dropshot rig next to the hen with my left hand. She turned on my lure as soon as it touched bottom. She mouthed the lure on the first shake. Needless to say, I drove the hook home and she took off for the deeper waters. Honestly, the fight was less than five minutes and somewhat underwhelming. She made one strong run. After that, she was landed without too much of a fight. I took a couple of pictures of my successful catch, and set her back in the cove. As she lumbered away, I saw her mate tailing her within a few seconds, they both were out of sight. By that afternoon, we had our limits of Rainbow Trout. After packing up all of our gear, I went back to the cove to see if the hen and her buck had returned to their bed. As if nothing had happened, they were there! She was fanning her nest with her tail while he patrolled the roost. ",

            "answer_text": "During my family trip to Disney world in florida, we decided to do a charter at one of the hotels. There was a very deep lake right at the carribean hotel, where charters always go out at.  I didnt have a scale with me that day but I was guessing around 6 pounds. Was a nice fight, but you tell me if you think this bass was bigger.  I can for sure tell you, holding that bass up to take a picture was pretty difficult. This one was caught in a small lake in new Jersey where I live, so you can imagine how shocked I was when I reeled it in on my kayak. Both were amazing bass but it's hard to decide which was bigger. I caught the first one on a light spinning rod with 6 pound mono so it was a hell of a fight, but I caught the second on a baitcaster with 20 pound braid. It was still a great fight but it was easier to reel it. ",
