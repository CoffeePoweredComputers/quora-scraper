We try to keep it \u201csomewhat\u201d child friendly as our young son really tunes into these books as well. This genre doesn\u2019t usually have extensive mystery details that involve paying very close attention (your driving is more important) but there is enough excitement and suspense to keep you awake and focused. Clive Cussler\u2019s Dirk Pitt novels are a blast and also his Fargo novels involving husband and wife treasure hunters, Remi and Sam Fargo. I thoroughly enjoy listening to Clive Cussler\u2019s books on audio. They are exciting, adventurous with lots of action, funny but not gruesome. He also has well written female characters. Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher novels. Admittedly, these books can be a bit slow going on audio, but do pick up pace as the story progresses. There\u2019s always at least one good scene where Jack Reacher gets to beat up an unwitting bad guy; very satisfying. Lee Child can get into some gory details depending on the story line. Any Dan Brown novel: like Angels and Demons (my personal favorite of his). ",
