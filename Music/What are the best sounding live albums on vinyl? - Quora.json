            "answer_text": "David Bowie Live at the Tower Theater. One of my favorite albums of all time since literally the day it was released nearly 46 years ago. I am an audiophile with a meticulously assembled and tweaked audio system. Last year I was thrilled to get my hands on the most recent digital remaster FLAC file version. Unfortunately my thrill turned to chill when I heard this remaster. It sounded dull flat and lifeless. Clear as a bell, everything razor sharp. But the sweaty raw edge was gone. It's too clean. So I ran it through some pro audio filters on my pro audio system (DAW) and got it sounding good again (to my ears at least). I added compression, tube warmth and a \u201cvinyl stimulator\u201d filter. Essentially what I did was turned it back into the analog version, except without the tape hiss. In spite of being an audio extremist, I'm not a huge fan of digital remasters. Some blow my mind, but I'm frequently underwhelmed by the lack of punch and energy. Years ago I digitally remastered most of my favorite albums and actually prefer them to the ones done by the major labels. Sometimes that warm punch of tape compression is vital to the sound. I've heard plenty of digital remasters that are just godawful. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion the best live albums on vinyl or digital are the ones that have kept the crowd noise to a minimum and let the live performance of the music come through. One of my favorite vinyls is \u201cFrampton Comes Alive\u201d just the right mix of live audience yet you still get the raw feel of the live performance of the music. If you want a great digital live performance, get David Gilmour's \u201cLive at Pompeii\u201d Blu-ray disk. Great sound and a visual. As a Pink Floyd fan myself it was as a must. ",
