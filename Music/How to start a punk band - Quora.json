            "answer_text": "Step one\u2026 decide what you\u2019re going to do in the band. Vocals (self explanatory - if you have a talent for lyrics, you may as well sing them - or if you can\u2019t sing then rap them, spit them, growl them or whatever. I\u2019m lucky because somewhere along the way I learned to sing).Lead (usually guitar but it\u2019s punk so it can be what you like, whether it\u2019s guitar, accordion, sax, keyboard. Nobody cares\u2026 and if it\u2019s a guitar, don\u2019t go buying the most expensive you can find, get down to Knox\u2019s shop Rock n Roll Rescue in Camden and get the cheapest you can find. If you have the skills of Bo Diddley, make your own. Don\u2019t be precious about it, just make sure you can tune it and you know some chords).Rhythm Section (by which I mean, bass, rhythm guitar, vibes, steel drums, bassoon again what ever you want really I once saw a punk band called the pukes whose instruments were all ukuleles).Percussion (Drums, Bodhran, military drums, gongs, triangles whatever I think you\u2019re getting the picture. If you\u2019re going to play drums, don\u2019t bother buying a massive drum kit, just buy sticks, rides, cymbals, stool, pedals etc or what is known as \u2018breakables\u2019 - note in some places, this includes snares so even this can get expensive).Step two find the rest of the band, I recommend using a site like join my band dot co dot uk through which I found two of the bands I was in. If not, well you know, ask around. Step three simultaneously, listen to one another\u2019s favourite musicgo to gigs near where you livefind a rehearsal studio (because it\u2019s cheaper than soundproofing your own space and because you don\u2019t have to buy drumkits, amps and so on) Learn to use the equipment.practice practice practice, write songs, argue about them. throw them away if they\u2019re not good enough. Do covers of songs nobody in their right mind would cover (I\u2019ve done Don\u2019t Cry for Me Argentina, Cherry Bomb, (You Make Me Feel Like a) Natural Woman, Lili Marleen and Bella Ciao among others and even with one band, Edelweiss.)Step four put stuff on the Internet, attract a following but don\u2019t take too long over this. Move swiftly on to Step five, ask local promoters for gigs. Ask bands to put in a word for you. Always be helpful to everyone. Even offer your services as a sound engineer or as a roadie. Step six. Keep gigging, keep learning. Get in touch with music journalists and so on. Work the internet to death. Carry on working hard. ",

            "answer_text": "MmmmmWell, first things first. You have to be a punk. And being punk is a lifestyle. It's a way of thinking and it's one of the most misconstrued ideals in the world today in my opinion. Punk is not about leather jackets, studded apparel, crazy colored hair, tattoos, piercings, mohawks, loud n fast music, awful singing, getting wasted, and being obnoxious\u2026\u2026. Although it can be ; ) Punk is about awareness and self expression. In essence: Be yourself to the fullest! Don't hurt people, be a good person. But don't ever let anyone stifle who you are. If something isn't right, if you feel an injustice being done in the world, if there is a cause that speaks to you, if you are aware of the powers that be and all the f*cked up sh*t they do THEN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Some of the most \u201cpunk\u201d actions (in my mind) come from people whom most wouldnt even think register on the punk side of life. For instance Neil Young\u2014 when Fleetwood mac was recording the \u201crumors\u201d album (still one of the top grossing albums of all time) the band was going through some serious turmoil. Infidelity between bandmembers, break ups, substance abuse, Stevie Nick's was there (I just personally can't stand her as a singer or a human being), but the band knew they had something special. Back in the day everything had to be recorded live so when the day came to record \u201cyou can go your own way\" those words were the only ones Stevie Nick's was aware of because of her harmonies in the chorus. The song starts, and Neil young comes in \u201cloving you, isn\u2019t the right thing to do\u2026..\u201d Neil young had Stevie nick\u2019s singing back-ups on a song about how horrible she is as a person\u2026. So punk Sara Bareilles \u2014 (I dont know if this is 100% true but either way I still love this woman) Her big breakout hit was \u201cI'm not gonna write you a love song\" great song. \u201cLittle voices\u201d is the album. KILLER ALBUM LISTEN TO IT IF YOU HAVEN'T. Anyways, apparently Sara sent this album off to get signed and label said \u201cwrite us a love song and we'll sign you\" so she wrote \u201cI'm not gonna write you a love song\" sent it back and got her a record deal! Neither one of them would be considered punk. But, they stay true to themselves. Expressed what was in their heart. and that to me is as punk as it gets. So be yourself, say what you wanna say, dress and act how you want. Just dont ever sacrifice a piece of who you are for anyone or anything. Then decide what instrument you want to play find other like minded musicians, craigslist, local venues, dive bars, friends of friends. Get an original sound, and start writing music! \u201cstop living half a life and start feeling like I'm half alive\u201d less than jake ",

If you can\u2019t play do what the Sex Pistols did just get a group of guys together and just wail on the instruments until you improve. Everybody does get better. Punk is about - the I don\u2019t care attitude\u2026 we have something to say and we are going to say it! Playing fast and hard on guitar will get you started. Amp it up - The fast songs in punk went well over 200 beat per minute\u2026 practice strumming a guitar 3 times in a second, or any instrument for that matter. If you have no talent - dress the part - express yourself - live like it and write music like it - like anything it will work! Meet up dot com is a good sight for local talent - try to find like minded people. gl ",

See if there are independent record shops where you live and look for flyers for punk shows. Start going to shows and talk to people. You\u2019ll eventually become friendly with them and will most likely find somebody to play with. ",
