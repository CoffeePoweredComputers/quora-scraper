            "answer_text": "Yes, surely he/she can become a songwriter without even knowing how to sing.But before that I would recommend you to go for the following: Listen to \"Good\" Songs- by \"good\" I mean the classics for e.g. Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Queen, The Eagles etc. (song selection may differ from individual to individual)Learn some Basic Music Theory-music theory is not necessary for songwriting as the world has witnessed a lot of greatwriters who didnt even knew about the scales, but if you have the basic knowledge about it then it will come handy to you when you want to write some more complicated stuff. Just go through Notes, Scales, Chords, Progressions.Try to learn some musical instrument-it can be any instrument depending on your choice.Analyse Songs-this is something which you need to focus on. Because small things can make a difference. Try to figure out that what actually does make the song soo good and addictive.Song Structure-or I may call it as song layout to make it understand better. For e.g. most of the pop songs usually follow the structure as Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus. So if you want to write a good song then you need to have a good sense of song structure which will go with the feel of your song.Its true that \"Music is an universal language and songs are its words & alphabets\" and on the otherhand singing comes naturally ! ;) Wish you luck ! Cheers !  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I classify myself as a songwriter and I cannot sing, I can only play keyboards/piano. I write all the instruments (guitars, drums, bass, keyboards etc) using virtual instruments which are programs that have realistic sounding instruments. I use these for the keyboard parts to although I play them myself. I then send my programmed song to other musicians so they can record their parts. Once everyone has recorded their parts I find a vocalist and the vocals are recorded. For my last album the vocalists wrote all the lyrics although for my next one I might attempt to try writing lyrics. So although I am not a singer I write all the music for my songs using programs (virtual instruments) and play the keyboard parts and collaborate  with a wide range of musicians. You can do the same!

If you don't mind, would you send me a piece of your work because if you can't sing then you should be really good at song writing. Just comment on this answer to let me know that you would feel comfortable in sending me your work. If you have any questions just put them in the comment section, or don't, I offered to do this so it's okay if you don't but I do want you to and in return I would ask you if you could review some of my work as well and teach me how to make a real meaningful song. I don't write songs, yet, but I write little stories and artistic explanations. You would understand if you read it. Please respond, I haven't been able to find a person to critique my work. I'm 15 by the way. ",

Anyone can write a song, I'd doesn't mean they will always be good but atleast they wrote something. If singer were the only songwriters on earth we would have no music, only spoken or sung words.
