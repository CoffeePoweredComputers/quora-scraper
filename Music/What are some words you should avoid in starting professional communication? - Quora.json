            "answer_text": "Business communication rarely goes beyond the borders of formal speech and writing, particularly in the B2B niche. Sometimes it\u2019s reasonable to add a slight touch of humor as an icebreaker, but most of the time you should stick to the regular business language. According to the report, over 80 percent of B2B decision makers think sales reps are unprepared. Such impression partly comes as a consequence of improper communication. In this post, we share 15 phrases that you should always avoid while communicating with clients. To whom it may concern In the age of the internet, it\u2019s not allowed to send introductory emails starting with this phrase. The reason is simple \u2013 you can easily find a recipient\u2019s name online. Not doing it only proves that you were too lazy to do the homework. Using \u2018I\u2019 instead of \u2018We\u2019 You are not the only representative of the company, so you shouldn\u2019t speak in the first person. Use \u2018we\u2019 instead of \u2018I\u2019 to show that your entire organization is supporting the project. No worries/Not a problem A client is happy to realize that you can solve his problem, but it doesn\u2019t mean you should use colloquial language. Phrases like \u201cno worries\u201d or \u201cnot a problem\u201d are breaking the norms of business communication and show that you might as well be too self-confident. We can\u2019t do that On some occasions, you just have to find a way to overcome obstacles or bypass standard procedures. If an important client is asking you to improvise, you shouldn\u2019t break the law, but you shouldn\u2019t tell him \u201cWe can\u2019t do that\u201d either. You can do everything \u2013 you only need to find the right tactic. We are not sure, but... We are not sure, but we can check it out. How does this sentence sound to you? If you were a client, would you believe that these guys could help you? Probably not. You don\u2019t want to let the client see you are confused. Always, never, absolutely Words like \u201calways,\u201d \u201cnever\u201d or \u201cabsolutely\u201d are too firm and vigorous. Using them, you basically promise everything is going to be alright 100 percent. But things could go wrong. As a matter of fact, things usually go wrong, so you need to avoid definitive statements. Think outside the box Clients want you to be creative and intuitive. However, using phrases such as \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d do not prove that you are different than the crowd of competitors. On the contrary, the expression is so widespread that it only shows your language limits. To be honest To be honest, this phrase doesn\u2019t sound too good in business communication. Why do we say that? It\u2019s because \u201cto be honest\u201d suggests you disprove a client\u2019s statement. The customer is always right, so you need to find another \u2013 more subtle \u2013 way to express disapproval. It\u2019s not possible When it comes to business, there are only two types of organizations. The first type can do whatever it takes to get the job done, while the second type uses phrases like \u201cNot possible.\u201d If you want to maintain long-term profitability of your business, you need to eliminate this sentence from the glossary. ROI, KPI, and other acronyms Acronyms can speed up B2B communication, but only if your clients are highly skilled and proficient. However, the truth is that most clients aren\u2019t familiar with acronyms like ROI, KPI, SEO, etc. For this reason, you shouldn\u2019t make them confused but instead try to use everyday language to explain your ideas. You have to\u2026 Sometimes you ask a client to do something before you move on with the project, but you can\u2019t do it by saying \u201cYou must\u201d or \u201cYou have to.\u201d It sounds too aggressive and pushy, which is not suitable for B2B interactions. Listen to me This phrase has pretty much the same connotation as the previous one. You can\u2019t order clients to listen to you. Instead, you need to address them politely and calmly explain your ideas. With all due respect \u201cWith all due respect\u201d represents an introduction to the conflict. You might as well replace it with \u201cI think you are a good guy, but your ideas are terrible.\u201d It\u2019s not our fault If something goes wrong, you should determine the cause and try to solve the problem. But you never want to say things like \u201cThis is not our fault.\u201d After all, you were the one working on this project, so who else is to blame for the failure? Calm down You are going to face an angry client every once in a while. In such circumstances, telling him to calm down is the worst option. Angry persons want to express their feeling, so let them do it and then try to set things right. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Using Texting Language These days, we use our phones all the time for texting and messaging. You may even message your supervisors, coworkers and customers sometimes. You probably use texting language to do this. While texting language is fine for messaging your friends and family, you should avoid using it in business. This is because texting language does not use standard English spelling and vocabulary, and it often uses abbreviations (short forms) of words and phrases. For example, you might text something like this: Pls B there B4 6 pm. TY. Pls means \u201cplease,\u201d B means \u201cbe,\u201d B4 means \u201cbefore\u201d and TY means \u201cthank you.\u201d Not everyone will understand this message. Even if your reader understands all the informal language and abbreviations, this message seems like you were being lazy or did not care about being mature and professional. In business, always use standard English spelling and vocabulary that everyone can understand. Therefore, this message should be written as follows: Please be there before 6 pm. Thank you. 2. Forming Very Long Sentences A common mistake is writing very complex sentences which are long and difficult to understand, with little or no punctuation. Long and complex sentences will contain many, many ideas. Your reader might not be able to understand each idea if they are all written together. Punctuation includes periods ( . ), commas ( , ), question marks ( ? ), exclamation points ( ! ) and other markings which separate ideas, phrases and sentences. You should always separate your most important ideas into separate sentences using the proper punctuation. Here is an example of a sentence that is too long and complex, without much punctuation: We wish to inform you that the weather is bad so our shipment will be late and now we are trying to get in touch with the shipping company to see what they can do to make sure the delivery comes on time, therefore, we hope it will not cause any problems for you. You can rewrite the above sentence more effectively by breaking it into three shorter sentences and using professional words where possible. Here is an example of how you can do this: We are writing to inform you that our shipment has been delayed due to bad weather. We are now working with the shipping company to speed up delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience. 3. Combining Many Ideas into One Paragraph Another common mistake is including too many ideas or topics into one paragraph. The paragraph below talks about 3 different topics: You are invited to our project meeting at 3 pm to discuss our weekly progress. The samples will not arrive in time for our sales launch next month. John is still waiting for your customer survey forms to write his report. Instead, you should start a new paragraph for each new idea or topic. For example: You are invited to our project meeting at 3 pm to discuss our weekly progress. (This paragraph will contain more information about the meeting.) The samples will not arrive in time for our sales launch next month. (This paragraph will contain more information about the samples.) John is still waiting for your customer survey forms to write his report. (This paragraph will contain more information about the report.) If the topics are very different, you may want to write three different emails. Then each email can focus on a separate issue. 4. Repeating Words Unnecessarily Repeating words unnecessarily (when there is no need to repeat anything) is another common mistake in business writing. For example: The shipment has been delayed due to bad weather, but we are not sure when the shipment will arrive. Instead of repeating \u201cthe shipment,\u201d replace it with the pronoun \u201cit.\u201d For example: The shipment has been delayed due to bad weather, but we are not sure when it will arrive. Don\u2019t you think that this sentence sounds better? It is much clearer and more concise. 5. Using Incomplete Sentences Incomplete sentences don\u2019t make sense and can confuse your reader. They will wonder what you really mean to say. For example, this is not a complete sentence: Since we are planning to hire new staff for our Customer Service Department. You can easily fix this problem by checking to make sure you don\u2019t leave any sentences unfinished. The completed sentence could look something like this: Since we are planning to hire new staff for our Customer Service Department, we will be able to handle more customers. 6. Misspelling Words Spelling mistakes can make your writing look unprofessional. Luckily they are effortless to fix. Can you spot the misspelling in the example below? We didn\u2019t expect to receive so many orders this year. That\u2019s right; the correct spelling is \u201creceive.\u201d You can easily avoid this problem by using the spellchecker that is built into most software applications. Spell-checkers will usually underline the misspelt words in red. Some spell-checkers can be set to autocorrect, and the misspelt words will be automatically corrected as you type. 7. Confusing Singular with Plural A prevalent mistake among English learners is using the singular form where the plural form should be used and vice versa. If you are talking about one, single thing, you must use the singular form, and when you are talking about multiple things, you must use the plural form. This is often challenging because, in many languages, the plural form does not exist. In the following example, using the plural form for the word \u201cinformation\u201d is incorrect. \u201cInformation\u201d collectively refers to facts about a certain subject and has no plural form. All the informations you need are in this folder. In English, uncountable nouns (for example, information, water, coffee) and collective groups (for example, staff, work, information) are considered as single units. Unlike countable nouns, they cannot be made plural by adding -s to the end of the word. They are always discussed in the singular form, so they are used with singular verbs or pronouns. The correct sentence should be: All the information you need is in this folder. In the following example, using the singular form of the word \u201ccustomer\u201d to refer to more than one customer is incorrect. \u201cCustomer\u201d is a countable noun and to make it plural, and you add -s. We have more customer visiting our store this month. The correct sentence should be: We have more customers visiting our store this month. 8. Leaving Out Articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d Not including \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d is a prevalent mistake among English learners. This is because articles may not exist in other languages. In English, these 3 little words are essential. They are used to show if you are referring to a specific noun (\u201cthe\u201d) or an indefinite noun (\u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d). For example, the dog is describing a dog that we already know. We both know this dog, and you know which specific dog I am talking about. However, a dog could be any dog in the whole world. You do not know which dog I am talking about, so this is indefinite. In the following example, imagine that your boss is introducing you to a consultant whose arrival has been talked about. Two articles are missing. Do you know which ones and where they should be placed in the sentence? This is consultant who will work with us for week. The correct sentence should be: This is the consultant who will work with us for a week. This is the consultant who will work with us for the week. 9. Changing Tenses Mid-sentence Tenses are imperative in English because they show the time when an event happened. However, other languages may use fewer or no tenses at all. This is why many English learners find tenses difficult to understand. In the following example, the sentence starts with the present tense and then changes to the past tense. The manager is (present) not in today because he was (past) feeling unwell. As a general rule, you may find it easier to use the same tense in one sentence. The correct sentence should be: The manager is (present) not in today because he is (present) feeling unwell. 10. Translating Directly from Your Own Language It is a prevalent practice for English learners to do direct translations from their own language when speaking or writing in English. They think in their own language and translate their thoughts word for word into English. As a result, their writing will reflect (show) the grammar and sentence structures of their own language rather than those of English. Remember that every language has its own grammatical rules and structures. No two languages are the same. If you apply the grammar from your own language into the English language, your writing will sound very strange, and your reader may misunderstand your message. Here is a simple English sentence you might say as you are leaving work: I\u2019m going home now. In Korean, the direct translation for this sentence would be: I now home go. In Japanese, it would be: Now house return. Can you see how different the same sentence in English looks in another language? To avoid translating directly from your own language, learn to think in English when you are writing. ",
