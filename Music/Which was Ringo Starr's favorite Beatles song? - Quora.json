            "answer_text": "Hi, In Ringo\u2019s own words: \u201cLove Me Do\u201d. Remember, Ringo had to be coaxed by The Beatles out of another band (Rory Storm and the Hurricanes) into their group. Ringo loved The Beatles before joining the group\u2026often going to see them perform in Hamburg after The Hurricanes had finished their shows. And it was at these shows that Ringo discovered that not only were The Beatles a great club act but they performed original material alongside the covers from the \u201820\u2019s-the \u201860\u2019s. The song that knocked him out the most was \u201cLove Me Do\u201d\u2026and was a main contributor in him jumping ship from The Hurricanes, who played mostly covers and whose original material sounded a lot like The Shadows, to The Beatles\u2026who also played covers but whose original material sounded\u2026well\u2026original. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow. I have never read or heard. That being said, one answer might be: Any song he played with the Beatles. A better answer might be: a song he played creatively well. As a musician, he might pride himself on (and consider his favorite song) A Day in the Life or Rain - but there are at least a dozen more in which he\u2019s a standout on. But the best answer probably is: a song he sings. Might be With a Little Help From My Friends. I would vote that song, as his drumming, vocals and the sentiment of the song might all work together to make it his fave Beatles\u2019 song. If someone\u2019s read something, I\u2019d be curious to know what they have read! It might be something off the wall. But WALHFMF is my best guess. ",
