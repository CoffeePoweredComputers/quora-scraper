            "answer_text": "Weezer produced a very popular album(their first) in 1994. It was self-titled, but is referred to by fans as the Blue Album. There were many popular songs off that album like Say it Ain't So, Buddy Holly, and Undone-The Sweater Song. Hardcore Weezer fans like me love the whole Blue Album, with songs like In The Garage, Holiday, The World Has Turned And Left Me Here, Only In Dreams, and more. Weezer then released their second album, Pinkerton. This, personally is my favorite album, and is regarded as an amazing album today. However many people loathed the album for being too detached from their original style. This made Rivers Cuomo(Lead singer of Weezer) depressed because Pinkerton was his own personal experiences in feelings. The band took a hiatus until 2001. The band didn't gain much mainstream popularity until their 5th album in 2005, Make Believe. The song Beverly Hills became very popular, although many fans of Weezer dont like the song or the album. Weezer began to release even more albums that didn't sound like their original garge-band sound. Weezer released their 9th studio album in 2014, Everything Will Be Alright In The End. Many fans consider this one of their best albums. The album didn't gain much mainstream popularity though. In 2016 they released their 4th self titled album, the White Album. This is their tenth studio album. This album is again considered great among most fans, and I personally find it as the bands best work since Pinkerton. That album hasn't gained much mainstream popularity yet either, but it was just released(on April 1). So there is a very long answer to a very simple question. I hope this answer finds you well.\\U0001f60a ",
