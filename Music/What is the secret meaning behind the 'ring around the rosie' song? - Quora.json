            "answer_text": "Folklorists trace this rhyme back to 1347. This is the year that the bubonic plague or the \u201cBlack Plague\u201d was on the rise. The Black Plague was a disease carried by rodents and transmitted to humans by fleas that picked up the lethal thing. By 1350, it killed about a third of the population in western Europe. Some speculate that the phrase \u201cring around the Rosie\u201d refers to the appearance of the rash that accompanied the disease. Red circles or rings popped up on the skin of those who were infected. The \u201cpocket full of posies,\u201d alludes to the plants and herbs people put in their pockets to ward off the fleas. Additionally, the rhyme contains the line \u201cashes, ashes.\u201d There are a few theories behind the purpose of these words in regards to the Black Plague. \u201cAshes, ashes,\u201d may be referring to the sounds of sneezing, burning of the diseased, burning houses that belonged to people infected by the plague, and or the dark discoloration of victims skin from which the term \u201cBlack Plague\u201d was derived. Lastly, the \u201cwe all fall down\u201d part is said to refer to the inevitable death the plague brought on. Suddenly, this rhyme doesn\u2019t look so cute anymore!Critics attack this interpretation saying that \u201cRing Around the Rosie,\u201d is an innocent, meaningless rhyme. Either way, it\u2019s entirely creepy to have children sing it after knowing there\u2019s a chance its correlated to death and illness. ",

            "answer_text": "There are considerable debates about Ring Around the Rosie as to when it originated, and whether it is about the black plague, and even when it began as a popular game for children to play. This nursery rhyme is sung in many different countries. And the words are varied by country. The song is sung by little children in schools around the globe. Folklorists trace this rhyme back to 1347. It has been thought the \u201cring-a-round the rosie\u201d referred to a red circular rash common in some forms of plague. The posies would have represented the different flowers and herbs people carried to ward off disease. The \u201cashes\u201d or \u201ca- tishoo\u201d and falling down was supposed to mean the sneezing and eventually dying from the disease.  ",
