            "answer_text": "This is An awesome question, so thanks for asking! I have been thinking of this question in my head for a long time now :) personally, I can't do high pitch, and I have other female friends who struggle with the same thing. I hated how Lata Mangeshkar in the 80s and later in the 90s when I was growing up, Alka Yagnik and Kavita Krisnamurthy were the most popular female singers , and they were all crazy high pitched (although they are very talented, trained singers). I think in Bollywood there has been the objectification of women in the sense of\u2026.a woman can't be good at sports, there are almost no movies about female engineers or sports people, women should not raise their voice, even if the situation demands it, women should follow the rules of their men etc.etc. because of the personification of this macho culture female singing voices always had to be high pitched nightingales. If female singing voices were lower pitched, they would sound less docile, more powerful, and hence, in the minds of Bollywood directors or even audiences, less feminine. Hence, the high pitched female voices remained (and perhaps still remain) as an assurance to male audiences that women are delicate darlings that need to be protected by men. (This is just my theory, of course). I like to sing Tracy Chapman and Adele, and I wish there were more lower pitched singers in tBollywood that I could listen to and inspire from. Of, course, Asha Bhosle broke the barriers and stayed away from the crazy high pitched notes of sister Lata, and excelled in finding her own style with the right pitch (not super high pitched), for that she will forever remain my favorite Bollywood female singer. There are Ila Arun and a few other female singers who also broke the mould of the typical high pitched singing and introduced new styles. Again, amen to this question, and I hope this changes in Bollywood over time as it gets more influenced by music, singing styles and female singers of the west. In my humble opinion, low pitched and medium pitched female voices are so powerful, and simply rock. They are the voices of the 21st century. ",

            "answer_text": "The mainstream commercial bollywood flicks are very very streotypical; at least that's how they used to be. Imagine the female protagonist, the damsel in distress, whose only job was to look pretty, to fall in love and dancing around the tree with the hero. Someone who could define the epitome of femininity in a very very conventional way. Imagine one tracy chapman or our very own usha uthup with their unique bassy baritone texture lending voice for those poor souls!! How would have they sound? Not really nice, right? Art in general or music to be specific, especially mainstream music, reflects the society we stay in and in bollywood that society was overtly patriarchial following all the clich\u00e9s. Thankfully the scenario has changed post millennium, or at least it is changing. Now there are plethora of mainstream bollywood female singers with their unique voice texture who successfully coexist and I'm sure they are here to stay and rule!! ",
