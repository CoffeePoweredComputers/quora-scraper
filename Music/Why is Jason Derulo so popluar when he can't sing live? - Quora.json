            "answer_text": "He's so popular because he's cute and he sounds good on the radio. Plus, knowing people and being in the right place at the right time often doesn't hurt either. There are actually quite a few artists that are considered \u201cstudio\" artists, which are artists that sound great in the studio with electronic correction such as the popular, Autotune, but just can't seem to reproduce that sound live. Some of the music industries biggest stars aren't very good at singing live, but they have the looks, the catchy tunes and some even write their own music and play an instrument. Singers like Taylor Swift and Alicia Keys, for example. Great songs, but horrible when sang live. Huge stars like Katy Perry, Justin Bieber and Britney Spears are notorious lip-syncers during live shows. Other notable \u201cstudio\" artists are the likes of Selena Gomez, The Pussycat Dolls, Lana Del Rey, Ashlee Simpson and the band Nickleback. I would put Miley Cyrus on the list, but her voice has actually improved tremendously over the years. So we'll give credit were credit is due. And let's not forget the Material Girl herself, Madonna. Great performer, great business woman but not such a great singer. ",

            "answer_text": "Pete Townshend of The Who once stated that during the 60\u2019s the clothes you wore were important, where the music you made came from was important. The music you made was not that important. Rock and Roll, and all of it\u2019s permutations and sub-genres, is about rebellion and identity. Madonna even went so far as to make music a vehicle for her lifestyle making it even less important. She was popular because she was bi-sexual, not because she ever did anything artistic. She said her artform was making money. Bob Dylan, on the other hand was at the forefront of artistic expression. He single handedly brought the idea of fractured thought into music. And he can\u2019t sing a lick. I like to think that we live in a time where we have integrated an ideal from Punk into the mainstream. That idea is that you should respect the efforts of anyone regardless of their proficiency. I may not like it but they tried and therefore get a pass. Jason is popular because he looks the part and his music is a vehicle for his persona. ",
