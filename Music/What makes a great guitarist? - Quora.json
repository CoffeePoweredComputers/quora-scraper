            "answer_text": "There are two traits that makes a Musician great: The ability the actively listen to every sound coming out of their instrument.The ability to create the sound that they hear in their head through the instrument.The first one requires the musician to slow things down and listen and \u201cDevelop a opinion towards every sound they hear.\u201d Being a guitar player makes doing this is inherently hard, because we all want to get faster than the next guy. But speed will come to you eventually. \u201cYou will have the speed when you're ready for it\u201d. - Guthrie Govan The second trait will feel immensely hard as a musician feel traped within the techniques, as if the technique is stating what's coming out of the instrument. The state of being able to create music one hear in their heads is achieved when you transcend you state of learning and mastering your techniques. This two qualities defines a great musician. ~theHazarika~ ",

            "answer_text": "Exact traits will vary based on scenario. For example a \u201cgreat\u201d classical guitarist, jazz guitarist, and metal guitarist will all have fairly different skill sets. A little will overlap (eg good left hand technique), a lot won\u2019t. What unites all of them is just what you might call \u201cmusicianship\u201d. Obviously, technical ability (\u201cchops\u201d) is part of this, but I don\u2019t think you have to have to be a virtuoso to be a \u201cgreat\u201d guitarist and I also think there are individuals with incredible technical ability who simply don\u2019t play or create great music. Musicianship also includes ability to play in time, in tune, to control phrasing and dynamics, and especially to make lines and melodies interesting to listen to. So bottom line is, if the play in such a way that it makes you want to listen to them playing, they\u2019re \u201cgreat\u201d! ",

            "answer_text": "What is a great guitarist is, to some extent, a subjective appraisal. It might be how popular they are, or how many recordings they have, they can play blazing solos, or how much mastery of the guitar they have, etc. For me what makes a great guitarist is a combination of all of the above. Being creative, a good performer and composer, having a deep understanding of the guitar, etc. A good example is Tommy Emmanuel, the Australian guitarist. songwriter and singer. His fingerstyle technique is out of this world, particularly how he plays with harmonics. His performances are energetic without having to leap from the stage into the public, throw anything, or set his guitar on fire. Tommy has created his own style and is recognized as one of the best guitarist by other great guitar players. ",

There are great guitarists who play with an amazing depth soul and feel. And there's every combination of those types of guitars that you can imagine. Personally, for my taste, a great guitarist is somebody who is very creative and has enough technical ability to get his point across. A great guitarist to me is someone who can improvise and make it feel as if he's played it a thousand times before, or who can play a piece that was already written and make it sound fresh and new as if he just improvised it.
