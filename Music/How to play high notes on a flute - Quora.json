            "answer_text": "All those answers are pretty much correct. However, one thing you should try is to have your teacher or a friend who can play all of the third octave try out your flute. The reason for this is to make sure the flute is actually working properly. A small pad leak that does not affect the lower notes too badly can totally screw up trying to hit a high note. If they can\u2019t hit the notes on your flute either, or they say they are having problems, have your flute \u2018adjusted\u2019 by a good repair person. Also if you have a dip in your top lip (sometimes called a teardrop lip) as mentioned Hal Coopers answer below, as I do, you will need to move the hole in your embouchure to one side or the other of center. It really doesn\u2019t matter which side\u2014 whatever is more comfortable. You will need to practice looking in a mirror for a while to get this working. If you want to see an example of someone playing like this, watch any video by Denis Bouriakov. I think he takes it a bit to an extreme, but it obviously works for him, his tone and control are amazing. I have heard him in concert and it sounds even better in person. ",

            "answer_text": "Practice, practice, practice the upper range. As a flutist, I do different techniques, like harshly tonguing and blowing the note a few times till it comes out. And when it does, do that exact same thing till it gets more clear and crisp. And don't worry it will come over time. But practice scales with those notes in them. Chromatic would be great too. Currently I'm practicing Concerto in G major for audistrict and it is tough\u2026 Even for me, a seventeen year old. But it will help with higher notes. I think the highest it goes is G\u2026 Maybe A. ",
