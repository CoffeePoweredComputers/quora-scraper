            "answer_text": "It does not sound different. Usually it sounds worse actually. I am not saying this to bash Christian music that has been at churches as hymns. As a Christian I like that. But the Christian/modern music that uses multiple rock instruments, drums, rock guitars, is pretty bad. It usually has the same or very similar low tempo. It sounds like \u201cLite Rock\u201d. Most of it suffers from being called \u201cChristian Music\u201d and from being reinforced by these musicians as such. Even if it were just that I can imagine it could be better if the musicians were more talented or more creative. Most of these songs are directed first person to God. It\u2019s probably because most of these musicians hope their song will be played at Church and that it will give them success. It limits the content of the songs severely. It means they already have to write music with lyrics as generic as possible which could apply to any and all people who might sing it at church. loosely described themes go like \u201cGod you\u2019re good to me\u201d, \u201cglory to you/God\u201d, \u201cI am a sinner\u201d, \u201cThank you for saving me\u201d, \u201cI was lost\u201d, \u201cyou created all\u201d etc etc. Add to that all the text from Psalms. The first set of themes just get moved around and slightly reworded. Psalms are usually sung literally word to word. It makes it so Christian music loses ,and is deservedly, any appeal to mainstream secular people as far as lyrics. But that alone wouldn\u2019t make the music \u201cbad\u201d. What really makes it bad in my opinion is that it all uses the same instruments, same tempo, same tone. All so that it would be easier for people to sing or hum to it church. I think Christian Rap is better than most Christian music at least because it is not meant to be sung at churches so the rappers actually aren\u2019t limited in how cool they may make it sound or what they could say in it. But that too, if you like rap, because it sounds like most rap. BUT, There are good examples of songs promoting Christianity from secular musicians. They rarely become popular. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know much about Christian music, but i do know a thing or two about musical genres. All musical genres are a mix of new innovations and homages to earlier big works within the genre. A mix between continuity and freshness. This is true for blues, metal, rock and so on.. Therefore genres develop a unique sound which the performers can't stray too far from - or it wont be recognised as authentic within the genre. Also musicians express meaning through both words and melody, therefore a Christian message will be attempts to capture messages from the bibel in melodic form - thus ending up sounding alot different than, say rock, which as a genre wishes to expres different meanings and values and thus uses different melodic means.
