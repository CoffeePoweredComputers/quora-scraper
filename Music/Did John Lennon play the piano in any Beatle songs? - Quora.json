            "answer_text": "Yes but not as many as one would think. For Beatles songs, whether he's the lead singer or not, it's usually Paul playing piano. Significantly plays the lead piano on \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d from the 1967 Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album. He plays electric piano on \u201cI Am the Walrus\u201d from 1967. If you listen to \u201cO Bla Di, O Bla Da\u201d from The Beatles (1968) that's John playing the fast piano intro. He had gotten so frustrated at having to record so many takes and figuring out how to start it up that he just did \u201cDum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum!\u201d (shades of a Western movie intro) and into the song you go! You.get more Lennon piano on his solo works, which is quite good. Especially \u201cImagine.\u201d ",
