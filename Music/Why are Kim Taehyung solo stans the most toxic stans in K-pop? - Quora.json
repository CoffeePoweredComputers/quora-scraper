            "answer_text": "As a Taehyung/OT7/TaeJoonGi enthusiast stan, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re toxic. If we are then we aren\u2019t the only stans in Bangtan (and kpop) who are toxic. Personally I think Blinks are the most toxic because I got bullied by a few of the toxic stans that made me stop listening to BlackPink as a whole (Yeah ik \u201cstan the group, not the fandom\u201d but it was hard for me to get back into their music after what happened. Back to Taehyung). Some might just be protective over him since he\u2019s been getting a lot of hate recently (for no reason might I add. Other members have been getting hate as well and it\u2019s not okay either) or maybe they\u2019re just a straight up delulu stan that might think that if they save him from some kind of trouble then he\u2019ll \u201cfall in love\u201d with them and they\u2019ll live happily ever after. Idfk- either way I just wish the toxicity between the stans in ARMY would end and we can just enjoy the boys company and content they give us.   ",

Honestly I thought Lisa stans was the most toxic(not trying to come for yaw I\u2019m no Blink so I don\u2019t really know for sure). But I do find a lot of them annoying. Eversince V won that most handsome face title they seem to think that it is a fact like no honey. I love V and he\u2019s my bias in BTS,but beauty is subjective. Just because people don\u2019t find him the most handsome or find him not attractive at all doesn\u2019t mean you guys get all offended and wanna go on a murder spree if people don\u2019t agree with you solo stans. That\u2019s all. I know all of you guys are not like this,but the ones that I have encountered with\u2026Lord have mercy. ",
