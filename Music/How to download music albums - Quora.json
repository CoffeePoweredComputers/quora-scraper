            "answer_text": "Below are 3 top music download websites: 1. SoundCloud is one of the popular music sites that lets you stream unlimited music and download songs for free. 2. YouTube is one of the largest sites on the internet offering unlimited video and music streaming; it has almost all kinds of music in it. 3. Last. fm with their excellent music recommendation system. You can see the list of downloadable songs from through the \u201cFree Music Downloads\u201d link present at the bottom of the page You may say these websites may not allow you to download you all music albums you would like. But you can use online downloaders. If you would like to download SoundCloud and YouTube music for free, I\u2019d recommend SaveFrom. Using it you can save all tracks from the albums you want to download, copying their URLs and pasting into SF website. ",
