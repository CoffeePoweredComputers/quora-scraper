            "answer_text": "Are we talking analog synths, here? I\u2019ll assume we are. Behringer has started making synths that are actually quite impressive for their price, even if they have some flaws.The Behringer Model D is a great budget copy of a Moog synth, with the huge problem that people have reported that it doesn\u2019t track pitch well over large ranges. But it does sound really good for its price, so if you\u2019re not worried that high-pitched notes might be somewhat out of tune, then this is a really great option. Behringer also makes the \u201cNeutron\u201d desktop synth, which is very good aside from a problem where the delay section makes a sound even if the delay is turned down to zero. But if you can look past that, it\u2019s a hell of a lot of synth for very little money. It also has a patch bay so that it can be connected to modular synths. I would personally not recommend buying \u201cbudget\u201d analog synths, though. If you don\u2019t care to get a good analog synth, then you\u2019re better off using software synths. They\u2019ll always give you good value for the money, even if no software synth can sound like a real analog synth, seemingly no matter how hard they try. If you\u2019re looking for digital synths or hybrid synths, I don\u2019t know much about that.If you\u2019re looking for a good software synth, I recommend U-He\u2019s \u201cDiva\u201d, and AIR\u2019s \u201cHybrid 3\u201d, as some of the best ones I\u2019ve found (and I\u2019ve looked hard). There are extremely many to pick between, though. And there are some free ones that aren\u2019t bad, either.Arturia\u2019s software synths are always a good bet, as well. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want a classic mono synth sound on a budget, Behringer\u2019s Model D is hard to beat. Just add a midi controller and there you have it, that legendary sound, for a fraction of the price of the real thing. Also it can work with eurorack and other modular synths, should you want to add more to your collection in the future. The Model D has a few limitations. It\u2019s a module (no keys) and has no preset memory (which can also be a good thing, but that\u2019s another discussion). For around the same price you can get a Novation Bass Station 2. It has a powerful analog synth engine, covering most bases, including Moog, acid bass and other classic sounds, with ease. Also has a bunch of other handy features such as an arpeggiator, sequencer, aftertouch, works great as a small midi/usb controller, has a crazy aphex twin mode (too long to describe here, google it. But maybe an analog mono synth is a bit limited for your needs. Then I\u2019d look into the Waldorf Blofeld. It has a bunch of synth engines, plus the ability to load and manipulate samples, with up to 25 voices of polyphony and 16-part multitimbrality. The desktop version is one of the best deals on the used market right now, in my opinion. The keyboard version is quite a bit more than the desktop but it has aftertouch, 4 octaves and comes with the sample license from factory. Unlike the others on this list, it\u2019s fully digital. If the Blofeld sounds too complex, you should look into the Behringer Deepmind 6. It\u2019s around the same price as the Blofeld Keyboard but it\u2019s a more basic, 6 voice, analog poly synth. It\u2019s designed more or less as a modern take on the classic Roland Juno 60. It\u2019s much less flexible than the Blofeld but it\u2019s analog. Lastly, take a look at the Arturia Microfreak. It\u2019s its own thing, very quirky but versatile. One of the best modern digital synths for a great price. ",
