            "answer_text": "Lot\u2019s of good answers. You are starting out just fine. Absorb everything you can and start writing now. I wrote a ton of bad songs at your age, but those are the ones you learn the most from. Don\u2019t write while judging yourself or you won\u2019t write anything; allow your inner voice to speak then tweak the language later. Many songs start off as bad scribbles on a page, but with work they can become gems. Learn about structure and like everything else in music (or life), start simple. There is a reason we start learning to play from nursery rhymes early in learning our instruments. Not only are they already familiar, they follow the basic structures of music with little deviation in repeatable and predictable patterns. Use the same concepts when learning to write songs, keep to the basic structures, and keep the lyrics simple and rhyming. Rhymes have auditory appeal for most people, helps in remembering the words, and keeps musical interest. You can grow more complex later. Speaking of lyrics, DO take an interest in your English classes, especially when studying poetry. Note that poems and lyrics are two different things, BUT are governed by many of the same rules AS IS basic music structure. Meter, rhythm, phrase, and structures built on repeatable patterns; the ABAB type of rhyme scheme applies. Break down your 4 bar phrases and see how they, at least the rhythmic pattern, has repetition or variation to it. True for poems and popular songs both. Rules of grammar are much like the rules of theory; you need to know those rules in order to break them artistically. Shakespeare has many many excellent examples of this play on language. He wrote in a poetic prose style mostly. Check out some Gilbert and Sullivan for many examples of well used doggerel and simple rhyme schemes to tell stories. Listen to the early pop, rock, blues and country to find unique and genuine (more so then today) styles on how language is used inside a song. Listen to how they lay out the words; often the word choices are very deliberate. Get a songwriter\u2019s rhyming dictionary, get a thesaurus. Learn how the English language is capable saying the same thing in multiple ways simple because of our history of taking words and phrases very liberally from other languages. All of this is to guide you in to creating what is called a hook. That is the word or phrase that captures the imagination of your listeners. You use it in the opening line sometimes, or in the often repeated chorus. It\u2019s that part of the song people know when they don\u2019t know the rest of the words. THAT is where your song sticks. How are poems and lyrics different? I like to use the example of She Loves You. She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah/ She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah/ She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah (so far a terrible poem but I bet you read it with the music in your head\u2026good lyrics) You think you lost your love/Well, I saw her yesterday/ It\u2019s you she\u2019s thinking of/ and she told me what to say/ She says she loves you/ and you know that can\u2019t be bad? She loves you and you know you should be glad/ Ooooo. Does not come off as well thought out poetry, but it does not need to. It\u2019s lyrics, and the message is completed with the music and vocalizations. In a love song, that is a considerable amount of information. Consider if you are able to read the lyrics without out Paul\u2019s vocal embellishments and the Oooo in harmony or not. You have a hook! Consider how the song is played with a lot of energy and how different it would be if you slowed it down in a more relaxed pace. It would be a totally different experience and likely would not work as well. Likely would not have been a hit either. Some poems can make great songs and some lyrics can function well as poetry BUT the two are not always compatible. They use the same kinds of concepts, though. Get on one of those lyrics sites and look at lyrics without the music. Look at songs you know AND songs you don\u2019t know, new ones and old ones\u2026then go listen to them and think of these ideas as you do all of this. I know it\u2019s a lot, but I did not see a lot of comments talking about the words. If you want to write songs, you have to fall in love with words too. Take a creative writing class when it becomes feasible. I took one in the local community college, so be patient if you cannot take one until then; take what is offered. There is no real order in learning these things, just learn them. You can still do a lot for yourself by continuing to ask questions and just diving deep into what is you want to learn. Your brain is at the best time for this kind of deep learning and I am very glad I was studying music at your age. It has stuck with me for decades. Took my first theory class at 16. Recommended reading for word smithing: The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr. and E. B. White (yes, THAT, E. B. White, writer of many children\u2019s stories). It is often referred to as just Strunk and White, and is an invaluable source for writers of any kind. Take writing the words every bit as serious as writing the music. Yes, do learn theory (I love theory!!) and do learn composing and arranging. Even if you do not use those skills by becoming a professional composer, they are still awesome tools to own in your song building tool box. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe there is any particular order you should pursue those 4 things, they all heavily overlap, if you are in choir, you\u2019re already on your way in terms of becoming a singer, Speaking generally: Start learning basic music theory, it is not essential but it will really help you understand music much better, it helped me immensely, I took AP Music Theory at my school, but there are plenty of YouTube Videos that can provide much of the same, comprehensive material Speaking on production, you will probably want to at the very least accustom yourself to using a DAW (Digital Audio Workshop), you may have heard of computer programs like FL Studio, Logic, Ableton, Pro Tools, etc. These are DAWS. You should probably research which ones best suits your needs and which one is affordable for you because you will likely have to buy some version of these softwares to be able to fully access their key features, there are mobile DAWs on IOS like GarageBand or Auxy, However, I am not accustomed with Android so I don\u2019t know of its app selection, you won\u2019t be able to compose or songwriter very well if you don\u2019t have a medium to produce your music so finding a good DAW is super important ",
