            "answer_text": "Understanding the Illuminati requires a redefinition of who we are. Mostly we've been taught that we're stardust that evolved via random chance into hairless apes with a high degree of reason. From that perspective, it's probably impossible to truly understand what or who the Illuminati is - because from what I've gathered, this whole Conspiracy hinges on the separation between humanity and the divine Source that is within each of us, and which ultimately is the animating principle inside the corporeal machines. Because when humanity does come to realize that we are spiritual beings first, having temporary physical experiences secondly, and most importantly that your individuated spark never dies, then we can begin to understand and work with the spiritual matrix of light that is our physical reality and manipulate it for a harmonious existence with our host - planet Earth. Today, the term Illuminati is used as a catch-all phrase for those so-called \"elites\" who control the vast majority of the currency and resources of the planet, and who use their financial influence to manipulate the course of humanity's development in a way that maintains their control. One way to look at this, for example, is that the technology of which we can't seem to get enough is the very same tools that are being used to transform society into a surveillance state. We are the ones creating the surveillance state - although this surveillance benefits primarily those who wish to maintain control over the greater part of humanity. Since history has been recorded, there have been two types of humans - the leaders and the masses. Sometimes the leaders ruled by strength and wits alone; this is the kind of leadership that is probably most familiar. In other cases, the temple priests were the elites of a society. And in some of those cases, the temple priests were keepers of an ancient wisdom. This wisdom is based on an understanding of how reality can be manipulated; manipulating reality has been, historically, a closely guarded secret.  The magic of reality is all but lost on those who do not use their creative power.  It's important to remember that letters spell words and words cast spells. It's called spelling for a reason. Most of us on this planet are unaware of the spells that are cast upon us on a daily basis that influence the way we think - which is why it is imperative to stop watching TV and start thinking for yourself. It should come as little surprise to those who study the history of tyranny that our ancient libraries have been burned and shamanic, wisdom-keeping cultures around the world have been exterminated. The goal has always been to erase humanity's memory of who we are and where we come from. Because so long as we believe that we're just a bunch of smart monkeys, then it's easy to believe that our natural state is divisive, selfish and that our motivations are based upon a long history of the \"rule of the jungle\".  Knowing, however, that you are eternal and directly connected to the divine Source changes the game, because you then know inherently that man can make no law that supersedes natural law. Today's version of the so-called Illuminati want to make sure that you never know who you truly are. So, who exactly are they? One could point to the international banking families at the top of the pyramid and call them the culprits. But the agenda they support seems, in my view, to run much deeper than a handful of family names. The Illuminati represent the opposing principle, they are the separation that counteracts attraction - the very dichotomy that forms the basic pattern of existence. In other words, they are that part of duality that separates itself, that says \"I am me; I am different than you; I am special, important and my needs are greater than yours.\" In a sense they are representative of ego. In another sense, they exist to wake you up; to force you to see that there truly does exist a dark side - a yang to your yin. So that when you do realize that there exists a dark side, then you must also know that there is a light side. And when you do realize there is a light side, then you can begin to make the choices that put you on your Path.  When a great majority of us determine to walk that Path, the Illuminati control structure will dissolve, and we can begin to reincorporate those lost souls back into the complete whole of humanity.

            "answer_text": "\u201cIlluminati\" was a secret society that operated for about a decade, between 1776 and 1785, in Bavaria. It was originally known as \u201cThe Order of the Illuminati\u201d and was founded by Adam Weishaupt (1748-1830), a German law professor who educated young members about reasoning and rational thought, philanthropy, social justice and quality of life, so that if and when the members came to power in future, they could influence political decisions. This was mainly working against monarchy that was prevalent at the time. To start with, the group was very small; just a handful of people, eventually growing to about 2,000 strong and continued to recruit members who thought the same way about monarchy and imperialism. The original Order of the Illuminati were not very successful. In 1785, the then Duke of Bavaria, Karl Theodor (1742-1777) banned all secret societies, including the Illuminati, and anyone who continued to support the Illuminati were severely punished. The Illuminati literally disappeared. However, some historians think that the Illuminati just disappeared from public view, but it continued growing steadily in an arcane manner, and virtually took over the world. It is thought they still control the world today. It may be true, because, if a group of powerful and influential people really \u2018dominate\u2019 the world today, we probably wouldn't know about it. Once the Order of the Illuminati was disbanded, conspiracy theories about the group sprang up. A conspiracy theory is an attempt to explain harmful or tragic events as the result of the actions of a small but powerful group of people. The theory usually rejects the media-published explanation of the events. In fact, the official explanation may be seen as covering up some deeper significance, a conspiracy. The Illuminati was accused of infiltrating the Freemasons, another secret organization that began in early 18th century that focussed on morality, charity, and obedience to the law of the land. Illuminati, was even blamed for causing the French Revolution. Similarly, there is a long line of conspiracy theories, proving the group\u2019s power and influence throughout history. Several Presidents of the United States such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were believed to be members of the Order of the Illuminati. Dan Brown's popular novel Angels and Demons depicts the Illuminati as observing strange rituals, Satanism, alien myths, and other ideas. At the end of the day, we may say that the Illuminati doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Or maybe not. For more information: Illuminati - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Illuminati is a secret society or organisation. There are many conspiracy theories associated with it. It is an enlightenment era society. It is said that Freemasonry is different from Illuminati.   Illuminati was found by Adam Weishaupt who had a Jewish lineage and was educated in jesuit school,his family's rejection of Judaism made him to start his own religion with twisted vision on how a man should be governed. Illuminati follows the concept of gnosticism,which means attaining salvation through knowledge. There are 33rd degree of rank in Illuminati.   Illuminati was founded in Bavaria,Germany on May 1st,1776 by Adam Weishaupt(labour's day is on May 1st). The headquarter is in Inglostadt,Germany. The world's first grand lodge of Freemasonry was established in London in 1717. What does this 33rd degree of Freemasonry mean? It is the rank or level of a respective Freemasonry's qualification. It is said in order to become 33rd degree freemason,you should have minimum 5 degrees. According to Hinduism,there are 33 types of Gods.  Here Deva means God in Sanskrit. It is said that our Spinal Chord can be intersected into 33 parts. It is believed that Illuminati is working to promote NWO(New World Order) agenda.    It is said that Illuminati secretly control the world by controlling the government of different countries. They have world wide networks and they communicate in code language or sign language. But despite their secrecy,the Illuminati were exposed in 1784 by the Bavarian government.Some members of the Illuminati were arrested,while most fled the Bavaria and this only helped Illuminati to grow further. Some claim that Illuminati was created as a revolt against the Churches ruling or controlling in Scientific matters(Scientist Galileo Galilei was made blind for arguing against Church that Earth revolves around the Sun and not other way around). Members of the Illuminati were all scientists,professors,dukes and many important people. What is NWO?  All enforced under a single world ruler.   There are many claims that president of USA,John F Kennedy was assassinated for trying to expose the Illuminati.   (Above image is a US Dollar) Knowing anything about Illuminati is very risky,because once they come to know about it\u2014you will no more be taken seriously. They operate in secrecy. It is said that Illuminati was behind the creation of communism,modern financial system,new age propaganda movements designed to affect your mind and there is not an area in your life that has not been affected by the Illuminati. This are some information that I know,there maybe still more. How much are all this true is again a question for debate. This are some of the information available on Internet.

            "answer_text": "Power is power. It\u2019s all about power. Grabbing it, keeping it, using it. Power is their currency, their DNA, their god. They control the world. They provide th blue print and they give the instructions. They are right here hiding in plain sights, buying and selling favors. Blackmail, treason deceit, these are their stock in trade. They shake down demons and negotiate with sorcerers. They have stocks in hell and compromising photos of angels. They are the illuminati.  As far as secret organization go, the most well-known is probably the illuminati. Their rumored membership includes nearly every public figure in the world including Beyonc\u00e9, Hillary Clinton, Pope, Barack Obama, Adolf Hitler and many more. This supposedly powerful cabal has been implicated in the Kennedy assassination, 9/11, the death of Michael Jackson and the ice bucket challenge and has been said to pulling the strings that make the world go round. So, what do we know about the Illuminati? The Illuminati is a cartel of international bankers, politicians, celebrities and businessmen, which seeks to control all aspects of life on earth: from current affairs to pop culture, and the governments. The Illuminati\u2019s goal is to establish a totalitarian government across the world and restrict our liberties. In 1776, a German philosopher called \u201cAdam Weishaupt\u201d set up a secret fraternity in Ingolstadt, which called the Bavarian Illuminati.  Adams group was radical alternatives to the freemasons, and supported many principles associated with the enlightenment era. The illuminati championed science and rational thought, gender equality and an end to state oppression. In fact, the word illuminati literally mean Enlightened in Latin. And the society used the ancient owl of Minerva as its symbol of wisdom. This symbol can still be found today in places like the white house, the emblem of America\u2019s elite club bohemian grove, and the US dollar bill if you look closely.  After some time, the illuminati, looking to expand their membership base, joined forces with the longstanding freemasons group. The freemasons were an intricate fraternal organization of laborer\u2019s; seemingly mysterious for their religious, like use of symbols and ceremonies. After securing their own free-mason lodge the higher order illuminati members attempted to recruit from the higher order freemasons. However, as a newer sect with different allegiances they commanded less respect than existing groups. Still despite significant infighting over the origins of various rituals, political and other petty differences the illuminati managed to recruit between 650 to 2500 members in Bavaria at their height around 1784. Around this time an obscure Christian cult, infiltrated the illuminati\u2019. They were very religious and opposed the idea of an enlightened scientific rational movement. After infighting further attacks by outside groups as well as too high a membership to keep the order secret, knowledge of the group got out. Many members were exposed and a number actually held high positions of power.  After being accused of publishing anti-religious literature, the Bavarian government banned all secret societies and seized and published a large number of important documents from the illuminati founders. This effectively ended the existence of the group. But many theorists believe that the Illuminati went underground and never truly disappeared. Across the Atlantis, lot of America's elites and politicians were already member of secret societies. If the illuminatis managed to survive today then they could be entrenched in our most established institutions. Conspiracy theorists point towards symbolism in Hollywood and the music industry as proof that this omniscient fraternity is watching us. They believe that the presence of pyramid symbol all-seeing eye and pentagram might indicate that famous artists are sent out a message or perhaps a cry for help, that the illuminati is treating the media as a powerful mind control weapon to brainwash the masses into submission. It\u2019s rumored that those who speak out against the establishment will be silenced. JFK, Tupac, Michael Jackson, are all thought to have assassinated by the illuminatis for disagreeing with its oppressive agenda. The appeal of the Illuminati is its secrecy \u2013 we can never know for sure that it doesn\u2019t exist and that\u2019s what makes it so terrifying. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea that the Illuminati are a shadowy organisation who secretly controls the world order comes from a triology released in the 70s by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea called the Illuminati Triology. The books are based on the idea that every conspiracy is true...all of them. That series is obviously a work of fiction but since the triology was released, may have jumped on the idea of a secret world order. There was a real organisation called the Grand Order of Illuminated Seers which was founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt. The Wikipedia entry on that Illuminati gives a pretty good background. Describing the historical Illuminati as just \"a group of free thinkers\" is a bit misleading. The order was essentially geared towards a strict regime of moral education, which involved writing monthly confessionals (the \"quibus licet\" reports) and spying on other members, as well as using the order's influences to get the supposedly morally superior initiates influential positions in order to slowly reform society to a utopian state where everyone would be so rational that any form of government would no longer be necessary. Adam Weishaupt, the founder, was heavily influenced by the writings of Antoine Court de G\u00e9belin and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who were both really big on ideas like primitivism and the noble savage. At the same time, the order was also extremely deceptive, using a variety of myths (such as claiming to be descendants of the Knights Templar) to attract members and it also had a very radical required reading list. As members advanced in the order, they were expected to read scandalous literature like d'Holbach's Christianity Unveiled. Until the Bavarian government published Einige Originalschriften des Illuminatenordens and Nachtrag von Weitern Originalschriften in 1787, two large collections of confiscated order documents and really the main source of what we know about the order, the only real information on the Illuminati came from disgruntled defectors, especially the juridical deposits of Joseph Utzschneider and two of his colleagues, Cosandey and Gr\u00fcnberg. Utzschneider had defected in early 1783 after someone tried to coerce him to steal letters from the Duchess Marie Anne of Saxony, the former electress of Bavaria and an opponent of Hapsburg acquisition of Bavaria. To simplify an incredibly complex affair: Joseph II, the Holy Roman Emperor, wanted Bavaria; the Prince-Elector of Bavaria, Karl Theodor, wanted to trade off Bavaria; and Frederick the Great did not want Joseph II to get Bavaria. Joseph II had tried to take advantage of a succession dispute in 1777, when Karl Theodor had become the heir of Bavaria despite not really wanting it (he was already the Elector of the Palatinate), to achieve his goals but ended up losing a war against Frederick the Great instead. However, Joseph II had a new plan in 1783, which a majority within the Munich branch of the Illuminati supported, and Marie Anne had written to Frederick the Great to help put a stop to it. The letters Utzschneider were asked to steal were from Frederick the Great. So there was a clear political element in the suppression, and it's not surprising that the juridical deposit left by Utzschneider et al.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Keep in mind that Freemasonry was around long before the Illuminati, and though their founder tried to recruit from Masonic Lodges, Freemasonry in general wanted little to do with his group which lasted about 20 years. Mostly in the modern day, \"Illuminati\" has two relevant meanings: As a general catch-all term for broad-stroke conspiracy theory. As a label for a certain sort of militant enlightenment philosophy that usually finds itself squaring off against monarchism and organized religion. The first sort is mostly the product of ignorance, and the label should probably be avoided by anyone wanting to be taken seriously. It's much more useful to be specific about your conspiracy theories and avoid generalities as much as possible. The second sort is very real, if rare in our modern world. ",

            "answer_text": "The Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, \"enlightened\") is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on 1 May 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life, and abuses of state power. \"The order of the day,\" they wrote in their general statutes, \"is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them.\" The Illuminati\u2014along with Freemasonry and other secret societies\u2014were outlawed through edict by the Bavarian ruler Charles Theodore with the encouragement of the Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787, and 1790. In the following several years, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution. Many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Xavier von Zwack, who was the Order's second-in-command. It attracted literary men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar. In subsequent use, \"Illuminati\" has referred to various organisations which have claimed or have been claimed to be connected to the original Bavarian Illuminati or similar secret societies, though these links have been unsubstantiated. These organisations have often been alleged to conspire to control world affairs, by masterminding events and planting agents in government and corporations, in order to gain political power and influence and to establish a New World Order. Central to some of the more widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati have been depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power in dozens of novels, films, television shows, comics, video games, and music videos.

Publisher Login - Search Anyway Adam Weishaupt (1748\u20131830) became professor of Canon Law and practical philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt in 1773. He was the only non-clerical professor at an institution run by Jesuits, whose order Pope Clement XIV had dissolved in 1773. The Jesuits of Ingolstadt, however, still retained the purse strings and some power at the University, which they continued to regard as their own. They made constant attempts to frustrate and discredit non-clerical staff, especially when course material contained anything they regarded as liberal or Protestant. Weishaupt became deeply anti-clerical, resolving to spread the ideals of the Enlightenment through some sort of secret society of like-minded individuals. With the departure of Massenhausen, Zwack immediately applied himself to recruiting more mature and important recruits. Most prized by Weishaupt was Hertel, a childhood friend and a canon of the Munich Frauenkirche. By the end of summer 1778 the order had 27 members (still counting Massenhausen) in 5 commands; Munich (Athens), Ingolstadt (Eleusis), Ravens erg (Sparta), Freysingen (Thebes), and Eichstaedt . ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Rafail, In order to get into the crux of the definition concerning the Illuminati or \u2018Illumined Ones\u2019, first we must fully take into account the true meaning of the root word Illuminate: ILLU'MINATE, verb transitive To enlighten intellectually with knowledge or grace. Hebrews 10:32. 10:32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; 10:33 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. 10:34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. The Epistle to the Hebrews 10: v. 32\u201334Authorized King James Version Bible ILLU'MINATE, adjective Enlightened. ILLU'MINATE, noun One of a sect of heretics pretending to possess extraordinary light and knowledge. Rafail, as you can clearly see, the meaning of this word can carry a totally different meaning; dependent upon the formative definition tense that someone is subscribing to. This is the very reason why one should never, ever take anything that someone says at face value; without, first, doing their own due diligence. ~JB3 ",

            "answer_text": "For me the researcher? Illuminati are those noted in the internal records as members. The central resource is today volume 10 of the Schwedenkiste Schwedenkiste - Illuminaten-Wiki The volume is today located in Moscow\u2019s Sonderarchiv but those who have done research in the field tend to have the jpgs which someone took on stay in Moscow a couple of years ago. The documentation is not entirely conclusive but otherwise thorough. We know a view members who are not shortlisted here -and we have, on the other hand, internal names which we could not identify. The 1344 known individuals have, however, been spotted one way or other. Each bio on our web base gives the indication why we know that this was a member. Mitglieder des Illuminatenordens As you realise I avoided your question of a \u201cdefinition\u201d - basically since I am not sure what kind of problem you want to create wit this question. (A definition is usually not a problem solver but an attempt to differentiate between \u201ctrue members\u201d according to our and \u201cnot real members\u201d in a fight against rivaling definitions). One can of course ask whether someone is \u201ca real member\u201d, a sincere member, or just a person who wanted to gain insight. Goethe and Herder - famous German authors - became members but were not really interested in the more tedious work (i.e. in writing monthly reports and compositions on given topics, let alone in attending meetings etc.) You could say, they were not \u201creal members\u201d. But then: what is real? To be a member meant something different things for everyone. Most members entered the Order as Freemasons when their brethren formed a local \u201cMinerval Church\u201d so to say as a superstructure within Freemasonry. You would want to know what they are discussing there, if you received the invitation to join their society. Young members would attend monthly meetings and write compositions on topics of the Enlightenment - and could dream of someone reading their work and of being invited to hold a public position. Again others were high ranking members and they would not share any such agenda. They would think of reforming Freemasonry - either with the help of an organisation such as this one from within or under the assumption that the Illuminati were an alternative. So maybe you tell me more about your need of a \u201cdefinition\u201d . ",

It has done this mainly through infiltrating the media and brainwashing everybody. It could be doing it right now. Alternately, it is one of the world\u2019s most persistent conspiracy theories. Persistent because, unlike the piffling conspiracy theories on the 1969 moon landings, John F Kennedy\u2019s assassination, and 9/11, which limit themselves with regard to space and time, Illuminati enthusiasts believe that something is up with everything ever, which as it turns out is very hard to disprove WHEN IT WAS FOUNDED The Illuminati has existed since the dawn of time. Its insignia can be seen on the pyramids, its influence was evident around the life of Christ, and their top bananas \u2013 such as for example the Queen \u2013 are in fact ancient lizards dating from an era before man existed (a belief that often comes with some rather unpleasant antisemitic underpinnings). Alternately, it was founded in Bavaria on 1 May 1776, by a man called Adam Weishaupt, who couldn\u2019t afford the Freemason admission fee. His society \u2013 The Order of the Illuminati \u2013 grew from five members to thousands in just a few years, but then, after Karl Theodor became ruler of Bavaria, secret societies were made punishable by death, and there the order ended.

I would think there must be one somewhere. But will it be a part of the Freemason network? Probably not. In the 1700s Freemasonry was instrumental in providing cover and channels of communication to men who sought out like-minded associates. Today, masonry is quite clumsy compared to the kinds of internet-based networks that are possible to build and sustain at virtually no cost. The proof can be found in terror networks who avoid public groups like Masonic lodges and conduct their networking and plans cryptically via text, Skype and email systems! ",
