            "answer_text": "Michael Manring, a great solo bassist and a genius, notes that the bass\u2019 low notes contain a very rich set of harmonic overtones, creating a lustrous, burnished, and complex tone. This he posits this makes the bass an ideal solo instrument. And he\u2019s right, a bass can sound wonderful on it own, with a lot of richness and complexity inherent in the tone of the instrument. And many posters have posted great examples of wonderful solo bass recordings. Ariane is showing you the way! If you know you love bass, then I would say definitely go for it and never look back. On the other hand, the scale length of the bass, and the density of harmonics, requiring more open voicings in your chords (as Ariane mentioned in her excellent post), mean that it is more physically demanding than and technically challenging than, for example, a classical acoustic guitar or piano. You might be able to progress further faster in solo playing on a classical acoustic guitar or piano than on bass, and there is a lot more of a repertoire to learn and play on those instruments. As long as you\u2019re just playing for yourself and close friends and family you may find you get more enjoyment and traction more quickly with something other than electric bass. Now I play bass because I love it. I\u2019ve played in bands for years and I love playing in a band, being part of a rhythm section, and making the music feel great, so that people can\u2019t help but move their feet or bob their heads. I will also take a solo, given the opportunity and the right musical space, and I enjoy taking a good solo immensely. There are a lot of great ways to take a good bass solo, too. It\u2019s great when it goes off well. But taking a solo with a band and playing a solo set are two different animals! I do spend a lot of time playing by myself, and I admire many solo bassists, so I have been working on building up a solo repertoire. My relative lack of chops is definitely holding me back in this effort. But I focus on being musical, and if my solo music is simpler than Jaco\u2019s, Manring\u2019s, or Bedrosian\u2019s, so be it. I have yet to perform anything live though. I have played for a few friends and family, and I can manage to keep a spark going for 15 or 20 minutes. The thing is I enjoy doing it even if I never actually perform this material. So in a way it\u2019s gravy for me. But eventually I will hit an open mic and put my feet to the fire. There is nothing quite like performing! ",

If you like the sound of bass, then go for it :) A few of my solo bass heroes are: Michael Manring, Steve Lawson, Jeff Schmidt, Cody Wright, Victor Wooten, Steve Bailey, Zander Zon\u2026 and many many more. Bass guitar is still a fairly young instrument. There is lots of room to create and innovate. Find your own sound, create your own thing, it is awesomely fun and rewarding. To make a bass sound great on its own it is helpful to keep in mind that due to its low frequencies more than one note played at the same time can sound muddy. To avoid that spread out the way you \u201cvoice\u201d the chord (knowledge of compound intervals and chord inversions comes in handy here. If you don\u2019t know theory yet, think of it this way: if something sounds muddy, see if you can play one of the notes involved an octave higher).Also tinker with sound settings by boosting mids and highs and rolling off the low end.Sometimes bassists will string or tune their solo basses differently in oder to get to higher notes. One way to do that is to string them ADGC instead of EADG. Or detune them to what sounds good (and doesn\u2019t break the string).Playing six string is great for solo bass because: you have the higher string and more options to spread out voicings due to having the extra strings.Technology is your ally. Here are a few of my favorite tools to give you ideas for solo bass adventures:delay pedalsloopersenvelope filtersthe POGmany more (it can be addictive)Her are a few of my pieces.

I'm talking about melodic lines that will \"sound good\" when played alone.I am also partial to \"White Rabbit\" (Jefferson Airplane version, not Great Society - listen to both to see what a good arrangement can do for a song).

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Rami Maroun. A bass is indeed very important to many musical styles, as it lays the foundation of song together with the drums. It is also a fantastic solo instrument! A bass guitar has a large frequency range from very low to quite high, especially when you play a 5- or 6-string bass. This gives a lot of possibilities for writing interesting solo pieces. Just look at the examples in the other answers. Making a bass sound good as a solo instrument can be a challenge. What sounds good in a band usually doesn\u2019t sound as good in a solo piece and vice versa. I can certainly recommend to take some lessons if that is an option for you and also ask the teacher this question. A teacher that understands what you would like to achieve, can help you choose the right type of bass, bass amplifier and effects. Good luck and have lots of fun exploring the bass guitar! \u2014 Edit \u2014 My favourite bass-solo, as an example of some heavier music:  ",

One of my favorite things about it is how versatile it can be, and how much ground the instrument can cover on its own. There are a lot of guys out there doing solo bass, although a lot of it is looper based, so that's something to take into consideration. Also I think you need a very firm control over your instrument in order to really achieve an entertaining solo performance, which takes a LOT of hard work and practice. Take this video of Victor Wooten playing Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cIsn't She Lovely\u201d as an example. Really listen through the whole thing, it's truly incredible and inspiring. Victor Wooten - Isn't She Lovely But ultimately it's up to you! Any instrument can really fill a solo or a backing role, it's all about how you choose to play it! ",

I came to Bass playing after 11 years of playing the guitar. Because I had the chord structures of countless hits in my head, when I came to playing bass in covers bands at the time, I found it very easy indeed. In fact i can honestly say (do not wish to sound egotistical) I don\u2019t believe I have ever dropped a \u2018bum\u2019 note playing bass, throughout many bands. When playing complex jazz standards, though, definitely. At first I find I need the \u2018dots\u2019, or the chord-sheet. Any players like Pino Palladino, or Mark King, though would sound awesome playing solo in a front room. I happen to believe that a bass needs to be fairly tight and simple to let the music flow. I do not like \u2018fancy\u2019 bassists. ",

A student at school two years older than me had been playing for a couple years longer than me and was on his way to studying at the conservatorium of music. I will never forget his use of a loop station. Mostly, he would start with a rhythm which he would loop, then add the all-important bass line and also loop that, then he'd add a few extra chordal notes to fill out the backing before finally playing very skilfully a melody of either improvisation, or a melody he had written, or even a variation of a well-known song. The world needs more people who are as creative as him, he inspired me to have fun with all of my music. While I have already learnt a lot of other instruments, bass is still one of my favourites because he showed me how amazing it can sound, both in a group and solo. I'm grateful. ",

But if you plan on playing solo often you will need to get a very firm grasp on your rudimentary skills such as your sense of timing, rhythm, and melody. It would help also for you to learn to use a looping pedal if you really want to up your solo performances. I would highly advise watching solo performances from bassists like Victor Wooten, Jaco Pastorius, Markus Miller, Steve Bailey, etc. This can give you a good idea of some of the capabilities that a solo bass player can do, but it's good to remember that before you can play at that level, you need to practice your basics and become a competent bass player first, because within those foundations you will find yourself grasping at straws musically when you try to solo or perform. This is something I've learned from personal experience. Be patient and keep at it. ",

However, it\u2019s been my experience that a great solo bass sound and a sound that fits in well with a band are two completely different animals. Many great solo sounds have harmonic elements that are in the range of six-string guitars. When a sound like that gets mixed in with real guitars, frequencies clash and the sound can get muddy and indistinct. Onstage, I get a lot of different tones from my bass, and it\u2019s instinctive to me to switch these sounds at will. Adjusting the pickup mix and EQ on the fly is as integral to my sound as my right hand technique. Part of being an electric bass player is knowing your gear and how to get the most out of it. ",

They also usually sang, and/or did other things. Good luck! ",
