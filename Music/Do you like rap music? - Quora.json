            "answer_text": "I like hiphop and rap quite a lot, but only the select few talented rappers of the 2000s that did not purely rap about money, guns, drugs, sex, and fame. I feel like this website explains things pretty well, but I will summarise the information. Egotism Many rap songs, especially those today, brag about their fame, \u201cstreet cred,\u201d and money. Honestly, hiphop is an art, and their is more to it than just boasting about yourself. Sexism While others genres are about heartbreak, finding true love, and the joy of being with the woman you love, rap and hiphop these days has always been about objectifying women into nothing more than objects for sex. Lack of Talent You honestly don\u2019t need much talent to be a famous rapper. Of course, this doesn\u2019t apply to all rap legends, such as Eminem (Rhyme King), Biggie (Flow King), or Tupac (Lyricist King) [Sorry if I didn\u2019t mention your favourite rapper, these are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head]. I am talking about the rappers that don\u2019t even write their own lyrics, and when they do, they use simple, ABAB rhymes that require no skill whatsoever. These are the top 3 pet peeves of mine when it comes to bad rap music, but there are some examples of good, meaningful songs as well. Eminem \u2013 Mockingbird | A song Eminem wrote to his daughter. [Intro]Yeah, I know sometimes\nThings may not always make sense to you right nowBut hey, what'd Daddy always tell you?\nStraighten up, little soldier!\nStiffen up that upper lip!What you cryin' about? You got me [Verse 1]Hailie, I know you miss your mom\nAnd I know you miss your dad when I'm goneBut I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never hadI can see you're sadEven when you smile, even when you laughI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry\u2018Cause you're scared, I ain't there\nDaddy's with you in your prayersNo more crying, wipe them tears\nDaddy's here, no more nightmaresWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do itLainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he?Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know itWe're all we got in this worldWhen it spins, when it swirls, when it whirls, when it twirlsTwo little beautiful girlsLooking puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you\nDaddy's always on the move\nMomma's always on the newsI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seemsThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on meAll the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see\nBut you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and meBut things have got so bad between us\nI don't see us ever being together ever again\nLike we used to be when we was teenagersBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reasonI guess it was never meant to beBut it's just something we have no control overAnd that's what destiny isBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleepMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream [Hook]Now hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alrightStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the nightI know Mommy's not here right nowAnd we don't know whyWe fear how we feel insideIt may seem a little crazy, pretty babyBut I promise, Momma's gon' be alright [Verse 2]Heh, it's funnyI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up\nAnd stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me\n\u2018Cause daddy couldn't buy 'emI'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin'\n\u2018Cause Daddy felt like a bum \u2013 see, Daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and MomAnd at the time, every house that we lived in\nEither kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the blockAnd your mom was saving money for you in a jar\nTryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to collegeAlmost had a thousand dollars\n'Til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heartAnd it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart\nMom and Dad was arguing a lot\nSo Momma moved back on to Chalmers\nIn the flat, one bedroom apartmentAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on NovaraAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Momma out to see me\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave meThen you started seeing Daddy on the TVAnd Momma didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand itPapa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habitAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab itI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\u2018Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house\nJust reminiscing, looking at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown\nIt's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still hereLainie, I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still hereI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?Sssshhh! Momma's only gone for the moment [Hook]Now hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alrightStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the nightI know Mommy's not here right nowAnd we don't know whyWe fear how we feel insideIt may seem a little crazy, pretty babyBut I promise, Momma's gon' be alright [Outro]And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world\nI'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shineI'ma break that birdie's neckI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha ha!) Or even Lose Yourself, a motivational song with expert, complex internal rhymes and meaning. [Intro]Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity\nTo seize everything you ever wanted\nIn one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip? [Verse 1]Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghettiHe's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready\nTo drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting\nWhat he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud\nHe opens his mouth, but the words won't come out\nHe's choking, how? Everybody's joking now\nThe clock's run out, time's up, over\u2014blaow!Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, ohThere goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't\nGive up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows\nHis whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dopeHe knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows\nWhen he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's\nBack to the lab again, yo! This whole rhapsodyBetter go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him [Chorus]You better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yoYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\u2026 [Verse 2]His soul's escaping through this hole that is gapingThis world is mine for the taking, make me king\nAs we move toward a New World OrderA normal life is boring; but superstardom's\nClose to post-mortem, it only grows harderHomie grows hotter, he blows, it's all overThese hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows\nHe's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roadsGod only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughterBut hold your nose, \u2018cause here goes the cold water\nThese hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold productThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\nHe nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera\nIs told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partnerBut the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah [Chorus]You better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yoYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\u2026 [Verse 3]No more games, I'ma change what you call rage\nTear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged\nI was playing in the beginning, the mood all changedI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage\nBut I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypherBest believe somebody's paying the Pied PiperAll the pain inside amplified by the\nFact that I can't get by with my nine-to-\nFive, and I can't provide the right type of\nLife for my family \u2018cause, man, these goddamnFood stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie\nThere's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my lifeAnd these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder\nTryna feed and water my seed; plus, teeter-totter\nCaught up between being a father and a prima donnaBaby mama drama, screaming on her\nToo much for me to wanna stay in one spotAnother day of monotony's gotten me to the pointI'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plotOr end up in jail or shotSuccess is my only motherfuckin' option\u2014failure's notMom, I love you, but this trailer's got to goI cannot grow old in Salem's LotSo here I go, it's my shot, feet: fail me not\nThis may be the only opportunity that I got [Chorus]You better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yoYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\u2026 [Outro]You can do anything you set your mind to, man I know I only used two of Eminem\u2019s songs, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other great examples, but Eminem is my GOAT. (It\u2019s my personal opinion, please don\u2019t hunt me down and attempt to scoop out my brain with a copy of your favourite rapper\u2019s album) Anyway, long story short, yes, I like rap music, but only a select few.

            "answer_text": "Not generally but there are a few raps I\u2019ve found creative over the years. My favorite Frankenstein rap is \u201cHow ya Like Me Now\u201d by Kool Moe Dee. I call it Frankenstein rap because the entire musical track consists of sampled instruments from other records. I\u2019m not big on sampling because it strikes me as stealing more or less and a way for \u201cmusicians\u201d to create music without actually creating it. They are to music what Dr. Frankenstein was to life. I liked \u201cBust a Move\u201d and Funky Cold Medina\u201d because there actually was a musical track behind the rappers. Which leads me to the phrase in the question \u201crap music.\u201d Music is a combination of melody, harmony, rhythm and in some genres lyrics. Rap essentially has no melody or harmony which to me, means its rhythm and lyrics have to be super strong to sustain the art form. Often, they just aren\u2019t. Thus, I don\u2019t listen to a lot of rap because the musical form is stunted by definition. But like all musical genres, it has its showcase examples to legitimize the art form. ",

For instance, here\u2019s one that I never get tired of - it\u2019s absolutely my favorite hip-hop / rap ode to the creator of the periodic table of elements.  Then, jumping over to Turkey \u2014 I don\u2019t speak Turkish, but I very much like the catchy vibes of this song, including the rap portions.  Moving on to India, they seem to get rap there, too - per the nearly 200 million views this video has received. So far.  And of course there\u2019s, well, this - a video with a memorable bit of rap in it - that currently enjoys the #1 spot, in terms of video views, ever. 3.75 Billion with a B \u2026. and counting.

            "answer_text": "An unequivocal, definite, yes. I\u2019m a musician. At my core, I love music. Of the music I love, I have a lot of favorites. I\u2019m a huge fan of jazz, and if I were to label myself with a genre, I\u2019d call myself a jazz musician, foremost. I like crazy 20th century percussion ensemble works. John Cage is one of my idols. And I like the kind of pop that Marina and the Diamonds\u2019 \u201cElectra Heart\u201d is- upbeat, danceable, but a little moody and cynical, while telling a story. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a word for that, but whatever that word is, that\u2019s a genre I really dig. But above all of that, I love rap. I grew up with rap. By the time I was old enough to talk, I knew all the words to songs by Eminem, Tupac, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, etc\u2026 My mom showed me off to her friends a few times, rapping Eminem\u2019s \u201cMockingbird.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what the songs were about then, they just sounded good to me. I grew up in a town overflowing with poverty, gang violence, and drug trade. You can probably imagine that rap was the dominating music choice in my hometown, even before the current boom in its popularity, nationwide. So I was essentially surrounded by rap from birth, and as I grew older, it was more and more ingrained into my being- for a while, I\u2019d stick to what I knew, which was whatever I could pull from my mom\u2019s CD collections. Around age 12\u201313, I decided that I didn\u2019t like rap, because some guy on the internet told me it was mindless anti-music, and I wanted to seem older and sophisticated. I outgrew that phase pretty quickly, thankfully. And when I did, it was like I\u2019d been going through a rap withdrawal for months- suddenly, I was listening to all kinds of rap that I\u2019d never listened to before. I was checking out Kanye and Lil Wayne, both pretty big at the time, and I even swerved (very briefly) into ICP territory. I got really into Hollywood Undead after a friend sent me a bootleg copy of \u201cNotes from the Underground.\u201d And somewhere along the way, I ran across some stuff by Tech N9ne, and I was hooked instantly. At that point, I\u2019d solidified my taste in rap as \u201call the old stuff I grew up on, and also some new stuff.\u201d I know, I know, very specific. I\u2019ll listen to about anything once, y\u2019know? By the time I made it to college, I was devouring rap by the album, digging mostly into the older stuff. I was blasting Wu-Tang and Quest from my admittedly pitiful laptop speakers most days. Freshman year, a friend introduced me to Kendrick Lamar, and I haven\u2019t been able to stop listening to him since. The man is a genius. He took two of my favorite musical genres and smashed them together into what I honestly believe to be one of the greatest albums of all times. And three years later, I\u2019m working my way through tons of newer stuff, and more niche tracks and albums that I find along the way. Just today, I stumbled across Zebra Katz\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ma Read\u201d in a Quora answer. My best friend\u2019s dad, who\u2019s more of a metal-and-country kind of guy, showed me Downer\u2019s \u201cSuga Boom Boom,\u201d which is one of my favorite songs now, another friend showed me Meek Mills\u2019 \u201cLord Knows,\u201d which was stuck in my head for weeks. I\u2019m always looking for new songs to listen to, especially rap. And now I spend a bit of my time every week converting people to the rap side of the force. And usually, assuming the person is open to new music, and is able to clearly express what they don\u2019t like about rap, I\u2019m often successful at clearing misconceptions and matching people to artists and songs they\u2019d like. Makes me feel like all the time I spend listening to new music is paying off, whenever I get someone to go from saying \u201cI hate rap,\u201d to saying, \u201cI still won\u2019t listen to Gucci Mane, but I like that one Snoop Dogg song, and \u2018untitled unmastered\u2019 is my new favorite album.\u201d I don\u2019t just like rap. I breathe it, and eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (which is for beginners, you ain\u2019t even know.) Now here\u2019s a bunch of songs I like, if you want to have a listen.  \u201cSuga Boom Boom\u201d - Downer  \u201cLord Knows\u201d - Meek Mill  \u201cI\u2019ma Read\u201d - Zebra Katz  \u201cMockingbird\u201d - Eminem  \u201cRain\u201d - Hollywood Undead  \u201cWarpath\u201d - Drezus  \u201cRegulate\u201d - Nate Dogg ft. Warren G  \u201cBonita Applebum\u201d - A Tribe Called Quest  \u201cFragile\u201d - Tech N9ne ft. Kendrick Lamar, MAYDAY!, and Kendall Morgan ",

Thus, a few days ago i heard the Moscow Philharmonic orchestra playing an all-Russian programme in Leeds Town Hall so I travelled and was helped by a very good friend. We both enjoyed the concert tremendously. Then in a fortnight I'll travel to Chichester cathedral to hear the Beethoven \u201cEmperor\u201d concerto and will be helped by my first girlfriend (we met in 1959!) who enjoys classical concerts but as a single woman is a little nervous about travelling by herself\u2026 so yes, it's nice to have company!

Thankfully I found a bar in my area that plays the exact type of music I want.. yeah the oldies and stuff.. so I don\u2019t have to listen alone anymore, heh. And it has some of the best food, so it\u2019s like heaven for me. But yeah, apart from that, I listen to music alone, not in a sad way at all, always in the search of hidden gems from long ago. My friends are not really as fascinated by the 70s/80s as I am because my country, Albania, is one amongst the many countries deeply affected by the pop culture. But that\u2019s totally fine by me. I\u2019ve met many people online that share the same music taste as I do, and that\u2019s awesome. I wouldn\u2019t ask for anything more. ",

I stop paying attention to the song and I wonder about their tastes and if they like it. I imagine them doing the same with me. And honestly I often forget the group they just shared. Instead I feel happy that we just got to be together. However when friends recommended a group and I listened on my own, the music sticks with me and I often find my favorite bands that way. Later I connect back with them and can find a deeper connection from genuine common interest. So I totally recommend both. If it\u2019s a new artist I think it\u2019s better to digest it on your own but when you both like the song, it can be very special to share it then. ",
