            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Shorter answer: I don\u2019t see Phil Collins listed. While his most difficult song may not eclipse some in the answers so far, he deserves mention. This is not Collins playing, but a guy doing a very respectable job at the very difficult Genesis song \u201cDown And Out\u201d from 1978. I picked this because you can nicely see what he\u2019s doing with the overhead cam; plus, the guy\u2019s left-handed like Collins. Pay special attention to his work during the synth solo from 3:15\u20133:45. Juicy stuff! Longer answer: As others have pointed out, \u201chardest\u201d is quite a variable. For example, is the requirement for your question to play the song exactly as it was recorded, including its feel? That really raises the bar because, like emulating Hendrix or Eddie Van Halen on guitar, a lot of people can drum difficult songs note for note (or at least close) but not necessarily convey the true feel of the original drumming. This feel is the magical element \u2014 the \u201cspecial sauce\u201d \u2014 that great drummers bring to the studio. Not only that, they usually create the drum parts. No disrespect to the guy in my video example above, but even if he can perfectly nail that song note for note and capture the feel, could he have come up with that original drumming as Phil Collins did? Keep this in mind when you see the great musical impersonators on YouTube. It\u2019s not all about technical ability. As an example, one of the best drummers I ever watched in person was an 83-year-old jazz guy at a small club in downtown San Diego. I was literally just ten feet away to the side. He had excellent technical ability, no doubt, but what was truly incredible was how he made the drumming sound. At his age, he certainly couldn\u2019t play a lot of things a 25-year-old could play, just for physical reasons. But there are probably zero 25-year-olds in the world who could make a drum set \u201csing\u201d the way this guy could. They simply haven\u2019t been playing and absorbing music long enough to transcend to this level. And his kit wasn\u2019t impressive and looked a little old and worn \u2014 but he\u2019d probably been playing on it for so many years that it was literally an extension of his body and mind. (Point: It\u2019s not about the tools and gear, either.) So, all of that is a long way of saying your question is somewhat unanswerable. To the extent it is, you have a great selection of songs in these answers that meet the criteria. They are certainly difficult in complexity, technical ability, stamina, musicality, and feel. Picking one over another is probably a fool\u2019s errand, in part because what might challenge one drummer might not greatly challenge another. Different genres also present different challenges. (I\u2019d love to ask all the great drummers mentioned in these answers what they stumble on!) Back to Phil Collins\u2026 His early work with Genesis (and jazz fusion with Brand X) is usually overlooked by new and young drummers, who only know him as a pop singer from the \u201880s. Nope\u2026 he was also one of the most talented rock drummers of the \u201870s. And that he could successfully transition between rock, pop, and jazz through five decades \u2014 as a drummer and singer and songwriter \u2014 is incredibly unique and testimony to his musicianship. He and Paul McCartney are the only two rock stars to have sold more than 100 million records both within a band and as solo musicians. (Coincidentally, he was an extra in the Beatles\u2019 1964 film Hard Day\u2019s Night, which was part of his pre-musician efforts to be an actor.) Unfortunately, although he\u2019s only in his 60s, Phil Collins\u2019s recognition as a drummer will likely fade further since he\u2019s no longer able to play. Nerve damage in his hands reportedly makes it difficult to impossible for him to even hold the drumsticks for long. ",

            "answer_text": "All the answers here so far are excellent! There are no \u201cwrong\u201d answers in this. What is difficult for some, might be easy to others. There are songs out there that sound simple, but upon trying them, you find that you just can\u2019t quite reproduce what you hope to. A lot of Bonham\u2019s work is like that. He had a \u201cfeel\u201d that\u2019s extremely hard to reproduce. Couple that with some of his more complex grooves (Fool in the rain, and good times, bad times) and it\u2019s very hard to get right. You can \u201cfake\u201d your way through them, as many do, but that\u2019s just missing the right touch. A lot mention Tom Sawyer. Yep. It\u2019s true, that\u2019s a tough song. As it is with most of Mr. Pearts work. I played in a band that was both ambitious and talented enough to cover Tom Sawyer. Seeing how I was a huge fan, I knew pretty well already. What I wasn\u2019t prepared for is just how physically demanding that song is. My hat goes off to Neil. The level of stamina needed to play a whole set of Rush songs is that of any well conditioned athelete. Add that to the level of complexity to what he\u2019s playing and you\u2019re looking at some serious shit. I\u2019ll put Stuart Copeland and Danny Carey in the same boat. Even though they are two completely different in their style as their bands are. An average drummer can fake their way through any Tool or the Police songs. But that\u2019s not really \u201cplaying\u201d them. What they have in common is all the vast little things they add to their respective bands music. Both are capable of some serious complex polyrhythms. As Stu once explained his style as \u201cbasic reggae shifted one beat to the left\u201d. You can\u2019t reproduce what they play by playing instinctively as they both are SO far out in left field. One has to play compositionally. And that shit is freaking hard!! The same band I played with that covered Tom Sawyer had also covered \u201cthe Pot\u201d by Tool. That song took everything I had to make it through. I\u2019m sure many of you know what it\u2019s like to start a song live with the thought \u201cgod I hope I pull it off again\u201d. It\u2019s downright scary. Thankfully I made it (for the most part lol). I still don\u2019t think I ever got it \u201cexactly\u201d right, but close enough that even my band mates never noticed (whew). I will add some honorable mentions, however these guys on that list are by no means easy, it\u2019s just my attempt to keep this from becoming a book. Mike Portnoy, seriously. Copy this guy. Or try. Could very well be the hardest of them all. Gavin Harrison. Porcupine Tree/ King Crimson. Damn this guy has IT all. Odd times, polyrhythms, fantastic dynamics, speed and just the overall great taste for playing so tastefully. (One of my current favorite drummers). Phil Erhart. Kansas. Dig deeper into Kansas. Not just their \u201chits\u201d. There is some hard shit going on there. Songs that you can\u2019t fake your way through. There are a ton of great drummers out there that play with bands that don\u2019t really show their true talents. Todd Sucherman- Styx. I don\u2019t think there is anything this guy can\u2019t play. The immortal Simon Phillips (played with Pete Townsend and many others). Just YouTube Simon. You won\u2019t regret it. ",
