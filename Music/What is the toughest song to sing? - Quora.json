            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if I can give you and exclusive \u201ctop 10\u201d songs. Here are the top 4 things that make songs really hard to sing: Extreme range (many have posted pop songs that are \u201chard to sing\u201d\u2026 if you rekey them for your voice, most of them are not hard to sing. If the song covers a large range you can\u2019t fit your voice over, then we have a challenge.)Complex phrasingLong held notesSinging over the passagioWith those in mind, here are my top two hardest songs to sing: Queen of the Night from Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\u2026 this has been listed twice and downvoted to collapse both times, which is crazy. This song is extremely hard to sing and is one of the highest written soprano arias, combined with long vocal runs in staccato.The Diva\u2019s Opera from the Fifth Element\u2026 has one note a semitone higher than the Queen of the Night and some VERY fast vocal runsEverything else after that falls in a bin of very difficult but more than if I really listed them all. Here are some examples: The Star Spangled Banner\u2026. covers a large range and very difficult for the average American to sing wellTake On Me (A-ha)\u2026 again, really large range, and for a man using falsetto that high is pretty impressiveEmotions (Mariah Carey)\u2026 Mariah had one hell of a whistle range in her day. Really most of her songs are difficult to sing if it made use of her full range, plus she can push her voice with power over the passagio.Chandelier (Sia)\u2026 Carries a lot of belty/mixy power over her whole range, requires richness on the high and low endGethsemane from Jesus Christ Superstar\u2026 starts of softer and more intimate, controlled, rich, then explodes in to 80\u2019s hair band style belty wailing (I think up to a G). This is a difficult song for many tenors to pull off live.We could continue this list with so many songs based on the criteria. I do believe most classical material is significantly harder than pop material. Not that pop material isn\u2019t challenging but having done both, there\u2019s a lot more work that goes in to pulling off a flawless aria. ",

            "answer_text": "When I feel like absolutely destroying my vocal cords, there\u2019s five singers whose songs I visit (in no particular order): 1. Aretha Franklin: Do I need to explain this one? I usually go for the classic \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like)A Natural Woman\u201d.  2. Jennifer Hudson: Once again, singing her insane high notes (or even attempting them, in my case) is a great way to screw up your voice for a solid hour or two. If anyone in the world hasn\u2019t already heard it, \u201cAnd I Am Telling You\u201d is a definitive floor-wiper.  3. Christina Aguilera: Talk about a vocal gymnast. I personally don\u2019t enjoy her pop music (I think her voice is truly spectacular and worthy of more soulful stuff) but her vocal agility is insane. She can do such precise, interesting, and perfectly in-key runs without missing a beat (much like Mariah Carey, as others have answered.) Yes, it can be excessive, but it\u2019s also immensely difficult to do. If I could sing with that much agility I would never shut up. Listen to this version of At Last (the signature song of another great singer\u2014 Etta James):  4. Little Richard: Just pure Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll. Hard to sing because he\u2019s got the grit, soul, and range, but also boundless energy (not to mention his iconic falsettos and screams.) An example is the classic \u201cLong Tall Sally\u201d:  5. Janis Joplin: Once I\u2019m sufficiently tired out from the above songs, my voice gets hoarse enough to sound way cooler than it normally does. Which is when singing something like \u201cCry Baby\u201d is probably (definitely) not a good idea but is also the only time I don\u2019t feel like an absolute failure singing a Joplin number. Her tone and the gravel in her voice mixed with the high notes she could hit make her difficult to imitate.  These are just soloists though. When it comes to singers in bands, that\u2019s a completely different game: Ian Gillan (w/ Deep Purple): Incredible range and performed with what I consider controlled madness.His vibrato gives me chills.\u201cStrange Kind of Woman\u201d from Made in Japan is a pretty great example.Freddie Mercury (w/ Queen): Need I say more? As with most rock singers, it\u2019s theoretically possible to sing Freddie\u2019s stuff without causing yourself permanent damage, but to get his tone or his power right is near impossible. \u201cSomebody To Love\u201d is pretty hard, I\u2019d say, although his moments of genius were more than often improvised. See below the infamous Wembley Stadium call-and-response with the crowd:  Robert Plant (w/ Led Zeppelin): If I could be any singer for a day, it would be Robert Plant. At his best (which some consider to be between 1969 and 1971, but I think should be 1966 - 1973) he was unmatched. The grit and soul he had is so hard to imitate. As for specific tunes, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s easier to identify easy ones because a majority of Zeppelin songs are hard to sing. Obviously these songs all fall into a certain vein of music that I happen to enjoy, but there\u2019s plenty out there that are of different genres. Someone in the answers mentioned Chris Cornell\u2019s music, which I agree with, both from his Soundgarden days and with Audioslave (listen to \u201cRevelations\u201d.) ",
