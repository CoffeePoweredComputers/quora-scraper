            "answer_text": "Kinda bit similar with this question, although not exactly. EDIT :The original question was \u201cIs Paul McCartney the greatest songwriter of all time?\u201dI have no idea why the hell Quora merged it with \u2018greatest musician of all time\u2019. Because that was a different beast. Musician is how adept someone at playing music. Songwriter is how adept someone at compose/arrange music. So my answer below is for Songwriter argument, not musician. As musician. Well, Paul was not the greatest musician of all time. He is an outstanding multi instrumentalist, but hardly the greatest of all time.On songwriter aspect though, as one of the greatest 20th century composer, he certainly one of the greatest songwriter of all time.  Well, I\u2019ll just copy most of it\u2026Paul McCartney is already considered as among the great songwriter/composer of 20th century. He is consistently ranked 1\u20133rd as a composer/songwriter of all time over the past 20-30 years. As the key member and part of Lennon/McCartney songwriter partnership alone, Paul McCartney already regarded as one of the greatest. His solo career achievement only solidified that. While the greatest will be a bit subjective, but the achievement were not.He is considered as the most succesful composer/songwriter of 20th century and modern music. Guiness Book of World Records, recognised McCartney as the \u201cmost honored composer and performer in music\u201d, with 60 gold discs (43 with the Beatles, 17 with Wings). As the \u201cmost successful songwriter\u201d, he wrote jointly or solo 43 songs which sold one million or more records between 1962 and 1978. [1] Paul McCartney has written, or co-written 32 #1 hits singles on the US Billboard Hot 100. Twenty with the Beatles, seven solo or with Wings.In 2009, Guinness World Records again recognised McCartney as the \u201cmost successful songwriter\u201d. Having written or co-written 188 charted records in the UK, of which 91 reached the top 10 and 33 made it to number one. If we totalled the number of week his song charted on top 75 in UK as solo artist alone (not including The Beatles), it span of 643 weeks, or over 12 years! [2]The total time Paul song charted on his solo career is longer than The Beatles exist as a band, or many other band.Could easily double and triple that time if we included his billboard chart on US (too bad billbord didn\u2019t keep track of that), or added his periode as The Beatles. He is the only artist to reach the UK number one as a soloist (\"Pipes of Peace\"), duo (\"Ebony and Ivory\" with Wonder), trio (\"Mull of Kintyre\", Wings), quartet (\"She Loves You\", The Beatles), quintet (\"Get Back\", the Beatles with Billy Preston) and as part of a musical ensemble for charity (Ferry Aid). As for influence, I\u2019ll refer to this already answered question.  Leonard Bernstein and Howard Goodall, both well respected composer themself acknowledged Paul McCartney (and Lennon) as a great composer. Leonard Bernstein himself also considered as one of the greats composer of 20th century, along with Cole Porter and Bernard Herrmann Howard Goodall, 20th Century Greats, Eps. 1 of 4 - The Beatles.The Beatles - Musical Appreciation and Analysis, Howard Goodall  The Beatles officially split up in 1970, but the impact their music had is still being felt today, and show abosolutely no sign of receding. When they started out, pop music was still in it\u2019s infancy. Belting out a raw and primitive sound. Then along came the Fab Four. They may have revered the previous generation of Rock \u2019n Roll such as Elvis and Chuck Berry. But what The Beatles were about to do to music, was to outstrip their achievement\u2026 a hundred fold. They changed the sound, the form, the ambition, the scale, and the language of popular music. \u2014 Howard Goodall Footnotes[1] 1979: Most Successful Songwriter[2] Paul McCartney | full Official Chart History | Official Charts Company",

            "answer_text": "I usually skip these types of questions, asking for the naming of an individual person as the G.O.A.T. in their class or profession. It's just too hard to quantify, but make for interesting discussion. Also, right out of the gate I want to be clear, I have many, many professionals like Sir Paul that I admire greatly, but I am reluctant to choose anyone as the GOAT in any profession. I'm pretty much your everyday, average guy. I have a life experience that differs from yours, my fathers and my son. I'm a musician with some minor local successes and recognition, I've traveled to eight countries doing photography work, and my schooling in psychology greatly influences how I see things. But I n my world, I am the GOAT! I'm not trying to be flippant, but it's the world as I see it, with all the influences I've experienced. So the world from my perspective is what and how it affects my life. From my paradigm. As it is for each of us. A simple example: Some time back, while living near SLC, Utah, their NBA team played for the NBA title 2 years in a row, losing to the Michael Jordan led, Chicago Bulls. For the Utah Jazz, a small market team without the Madison Avenue powers at play, were not as well known, yet Karl Malone was a force to be reckoned with and perhaps one of the best power forwards in basketball. Teamed with the NBA record holder in assists and steals, point guard John Stockton. A picture perfect point guard. They're not mentioned as possible GOATs, but consider their accomplishments with those from well funded, large market teams. It was amazing to enjoy their success as they took the championship series to game seven. But what if Stockton had been a Bull, WITH Jordan? My son, who I affectionately call \"New School,\" as he calls me \"Old School,\" tells me that the Jordan lead Bulls are the GOAT basketball team. I counter that the Lakers from the early '80s would win a match up with the Bulls. Even the original \"Dream Team\" could, in my world. Hard to argue. I mean Michael Jordan! To many, especially during his heyday, is or was considered to be the GOAT in basketball. Tough to argue. But what about Rick Berry? It's said that he is the player on the NBA logo, a silhouette of a player on a divided red and blue back ground. Some older fans I knew believe him to have the title and an honorable reputation making him more deserving. Hard to argue. Here's the rub, these incredible talents are likely to be the best at their skillset, at that point in time. But how can we realistically compare? Barry Sanders, running back for the Detroit Lions was amazing! But his team, for the most part wasn't. But what if had been on the 49ers or the Cowboys during that era? Steve Young from the Niners started in Tampa Bay, spending too much time on his back, due to a relatively new club not having built a balanced O line to match the abilities of their QB. Had he had an offensive line as he did in San Francisco, where he won several Super Bowls, it maybe a different story all together. Back to music, Paul, and outlandish titles like GOAT. I agree he can't be discounted. The problem is we want them to be larger than life. Heroes we can vicariously live for and cheer for. It's seemingly something our culture wants and needs. Not just current heroes to look up to, but a heroes for the ages. Like Jesus, Moses, Mother Theresa, Mohamed, Zeus, Abraham Lincoln, and so many more greats. Anymore, there aren't many who could stand up to the scrutiny. It seems the adulation and pressure to stay at the top leads to a system failure and disappointed following, In ANY professional field of expertise. Though there are some amazing, talented, gifted people out there. Apologize for the sports theme counterpoint, it's just an easy way to see how our sports heroes, from eras, with changes in healthcare, technologies, and even rules can alter points of view. One fan accused me of being myopic, stating he was a \"realist\" and therefore his views were reality. Sure, HIS reality. We all see reality from a paradigm of our own life experiences. I was a teen in the '70s. The biggest and best rock 'n roll of all time was created then. IMHO. But to my father, no one holds a candle to Sinatra, except maybe Tony Bennett. I've seen Paul in concert a couple of times now, and he is incredible! He has written some great music, and seems to be a solid man. By all I've read, he's been a faithful husband, positive force who for several eras in music remained relevant to varying degrees. Perhaps if we could build an algorithm to factor things like the circumstances of their upbringing, the affects of geographical events, world wars, lost loved ones and a factor for the individuals age attained when these events take place. Not to forget professional influences, pairings, and even their rivals, successes, and failures. Then factore the given opportunities to learn, without a stifling parent, teacher or government; add the # of songs written; # of records sold; # of top 10 song and/or albums; # of times the songs are covered, # of times aired world wide, # of awards won. . . Geez, it simply can't be quantified in a manner that all will agree on. In final summation, from my point of view, filtered by my life experience, and bolstered by my musical experience . . . I'd have to give it to, or at least make a strong case for McCartney. Hard to argue. But then again, of course, I'm a realist! ",

Paul McCarthy, had the awesome band \u201cWings\u201d and believe it or not Linda McCartney co-wrote those songs with him. Besides, there\u2019s a rumor going around that the real Paul McCartney was killed in London, in a car crash on November 9, 1966. He was replaced with someone named Billy Shears, I believe, to spare fans the grief. haha. Conspiracy theorist swear it\u2019s true! They even show before and after pictures saying there\u2019s a difference and that this Faul aka Paul, never ages. They looked for clues and in, Strawberry Fields Forever, at the end of the song if you play it backwards John Lennon is claimed to have said \u201cWe Buried Paul.\u201d On the album, Abbey Road, Lennon is wearing white. it\u2019s suppose to signify heaven ( I don\u2019t understand it.) Ringo signifies the undertaker, George in denim is the gravedigger, and Paul is out of step with the rest of them. Theres a license plate on a car in the picture with the same license plate I think, Linda is crying, and Paul is holding a cigarette in a different hand than the hand he usually does showing he\u2019s not the real Paul, lol. There was also a magazine, Paul is Dead, I believe. The conspiracy shot up record sales as well, so that could be a huge reason why they fed into it. ",

This can be said about everything in music..best writer, best composer, best arranger..etc. The best one can be is..and this only applys to yourself, being distinct and original so that when a person listens to you they know it\u2019s you. He may be the best at the speed he writes songs because he is in the Guinness book of world records for wring so many songs, but it doesn\u2019t make him greatest musician ever.. btw I love Paul McCartney..love his songs, his melodies, his singing, the way he harmonizes, if i didn\u2019t know any better i would say he is the best there ever was, but i know better for the many reasons listed above.

Now as a songwriter, you make that argument (although there is much top tier competition), but not best musician. ",

Paul is my favorite songwriter but I always rank the top 3 being Dylan, Lennon, and McCartney in any order. Based on his versatility I'd say he is and it's not even considering he can create any album by himself. ",
