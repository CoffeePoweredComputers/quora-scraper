            "answer_text": "Kaisee teri khudgarzeeNa dhoop chune na chhaanvKaisee teri khudgarzeeKisi thaur tike na paanvHow's this selfishness of yours,that you don't take the sun, nor take the shade..How's this selfishness of yours,that your feet don't stay anywhere.. Ban liyaa apnaa paighambarTar liyaa tu saat samandarPhir bhee sookhaa mann ke andarKyoon reh gayaYou've tried being your own god,and crossed all seven seas,Still, there is a draught within your heart,Why is it so.. Re Kabeera maan jaaRe Fakeera maan jaaAa jaa tujh ko pukaaray teri parchhaaiyaanRe Kabira maan jaaRe Fakeera maan jaaKaisa tu hai nirmohee kaisaa harjaaiyaaO Kabira, listen to me..O saint, believe me.. Come, your shadows call you [back]..O Kabira, listen to me..O saintly one, believe me.. What a loveless and ruthless person you are.. [Nirmohee is someone who doesn't have any love nor hatred, for anyone or anything. Someone who is neutral to the world and its happenings.] Tooti chaarpaai wo hiThandi purvaai rastaa dekheDoodhon ki malaayi wohiMitti ki suraahee rastaa dekhe..That broken cot,that cool breeze from the east, awaits you..That milk creamand the earthen pot of cold water await you.. [Suraahee is an earthen pot with a long neck and keeps water cool.] Kaisi teri khudgarziLab namak rame naa misreeKaisi teri khudgarziTujhe preet purani bisri..Mast Maula, mast KalandarTu hawa kaa ek bavandarBujh ke yoon andar hi andarKyun reh gaya..How's this selfishness of yours,Neither salt nor sugar fit on your tongue..How's this selfishness of yours,that you have forgot old love..O free man, free spirit,you're a storm of wind..then why have you ended within yourself only.. Re Kabira maan jaaRe Faqeera maan jaaAa jaa tujh ko pukaaray teri parchhaaiyaanRe Kabeera maan jaaRe Fakeera maan jaaKaisa tu hai nirmohi kaisa harjaiyaa...

            "answer_text": "I tell u d meaning of song in different percepective.. If you listen this song you will come to know that there are two persons. One is Kabir and another is someone or may be a his friend or well wisher.. Kaisi Teri KhudgarziNa Dhoop Chune Na ChhaaonKaisi Teri KhudgarziKisi Thor Tike Na Paaon Here, frnd is saying to him.. why r u like this? Why u so stubborn? What r u seeking for? U r not able to see what is around you.. in search of something, ur heart is racing n u r not stable. Don't be stubborn with urself. Ban Liya Apna PaigambarTar Liya Tu Saat SamandarPhir Bhi Sookha Mann Ke AndarKyun Reh Gaya Here, in this stanza, frnd is saying to Kabir. Now u have become your own God, u achieved everything.. u have gone far beyond..you crossed d seven seas.. even what left you thirsty? Why there is dryness inside you? May be heart is still empty.. Re Kabira Maan JaaRe Faqeera Maan JaaAaja Tujhko Pukaare Teri ParchhaaiyanRe Kabira Maan JaRe Faqeera Maan JaKaisa Tu Hai Nirmohi Kaisa Harjaaiya.. Here, frnd is saying to Kabir.. plz Kabir listen.. she calls him Fakir as well. You know why Fakir she calls him bcz Kabir was saint n he was also roaming around the world.. she is saying plz listen to me, pls listen to urself.. plz return to ur home.. ur own shadow calling you.. whatever but left behind is waiting for u..even why u beahave like selfish.. Tooti Chaarpaai WohiThandi Purvaai Rasta DekheDoodhon Ki Malaai WohiMitti Ki Suraahi Rasta Dekhe.. Kabir.. Everything is still there and everyone is waiting for u. Please come back.. don't wander.. rest for a while.. Kaisi Teri Khudgarzi Lab Namak Rame Na Misri Kaisi Teri KhudgarziTujhe Preet Purani Bisri..Mast Maula, Mast KalanderTu Hawa Ka Ek BavandarBujh Ke Yun Andar Hi AndarKyun Reh Gaya.. Here frnd is saying to Kabir.. you have forgotten old love.. you are free man, a free spirited person.. u r strong wind.. then why u stucked? Re Kabira Maan JaaRe Faqeera Maan JaaAaja Tujhko Pukaare Teri ParchhaaiyanRe Kabira Maan JaRe Faqeera Maan JaKaisa Tu Hai Nirmohi Kaisa Harjaaiya... Actually... many ppl are running for something.. thr is a greed that never end.. for something their heart crave for.. they forget themsleves.. after all that, we have to stop for a while to look at the things in different perceptive.. u have to analyze it.. you don't have to loose urself in this process..
