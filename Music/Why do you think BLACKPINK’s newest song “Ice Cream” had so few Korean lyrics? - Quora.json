            "answer_text": "I can answer yoru question. See, I think its common knowledge that Blacklink has begun to break into the wrst and has more listeners internationally rather than domestically as is typical for kpop groups. Because of this, YG wants to appeal more to the international audience. Its the same reason why Lisa, Jennie, and Rosie are popular in the west while Jisoo is the least popular. It\u2019s because she cannot speak English as well. Fans connect best with those they understand, and YG is trying to connect with these international fans to help Blackpink break into the west. Plus, they had an English speaking white feature (yes some Latinos are white gosh get over it) so they needed to have lyrics corresponding with hers. Keep in mind Selena got a LOT of lyrics. Possibly even more lyrics than Jisoo and Rose. Because of this, the other girls lines would have to be a least partially English to connect back, and the outcome would be a song with more English than Korean. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it wasnt targeted towards Korean markets, it was targeted towards the west, the song featured selena gomez a western artist and the time of its release also went well with the America, this song isnt meant for Korean charts or market, that's why it had very few korean lines.
