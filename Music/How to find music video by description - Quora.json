The video goes as all of them are dancing through the song and as the video shows that in a quick look they are each covered in black cloth and in another look but this time its long they each are placed in a certain room in the same hotel like one is in the elevator another is in a hallway. But they all meet the same boy but he is not korean/japanese he looks english. As the boy keeps staring at each other he goes near to each of them and kisses them as they get kissed the black cloths them are removed on the girls that were covered. ",
