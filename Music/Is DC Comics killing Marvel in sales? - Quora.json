            "answer_text": "Yes, but only recenetly, also only looking at numbers won\u2019t tell the entire story. DC fall off in comic book sales after New 52 and Marvel took over as the dominant seller for years. Marvel started experimenting with their stuff a lot, like hiring hordes of hardcore feminist writers which made a lot of people less interested in Marvel comic books, by the time Marvel\u2019s sales started dropping DC came out with a boom, they created Rebirth which fixed a lot of what New 52 and Convergence created. People have liked Rebirth a lot thus far and Marvel isn\u2019t losing any of their Feminist/SJW writers so is still only slowly climbing back up. Marvel is still selling a lot of books, right? Wrong. Most of the sales you see are sold to comic book stores and a lot of comic book stores world wide have complained that Marvel comic book sales are going down in their stores and comic books are going to waste. A lot of comic book store owners have said that Marvel at one point went desperate and started shipping free extra copies to stores. What made people not buy DC New52 comic books? Everything was too different. What was Marvel\u2019s idea? To make everything too different. It\u2019s like Marvel forgot New 52 ever happened. They changed the classics like Thor, Captain America, Hulk etc too much and people lost interest. Why make a new character when you can just take Thor, throw him away and replace him with a woman, feminism. Imagine if Batman and Superman were replaced with completely new Women characters, DC would go out of business real quick. That being said I really like Unworthy Thor series, I couldn\u2019t recommend enough to read it, it\u2019s one for the ages. Why is Marvel selling less?  ",

            "answer_text": "No. In July 2016 with DC Rebirth, DC actually overtook Marvel in terms of sales numbers despite having almost a third fewer titles but if we don\u2019t take a single month snapshot things are a lot more confusing. On the other hand although neither company is killing the other right now Marvel used to be well ahead of DC.  (source) However most of that was due to DC: Rebirth; of the top ten selling comics in July 2016 six of them were issue 1s of a new series - and a lot of comics fans get the issue 1 then decide whether to stay with the run. This drops off fast and by October Marvel were outselling DC.  (source) Last month (Feb 17) they were back to neck and neck - however all Marvel\u2019s titles in the top 10 were Star Wars comics - and with the sole exception of Super Sons #1 (Batman\u2019s kid + Superman\u2019s kid) every single DC title in the top 10 was either a Batman title or a Justice League title featuring Batman.  (source) Neither company is killing the other right now. However. If we look back one year we find that people spent an average of 4.5% more on comics - and it\u2019s Marvel that\u2019s bled marketshare from a year ago.  And a year before that the comics market for February was more than 6% bigger still - and again Marvel was dominating.  DC aren\u2019t killing Marvel - but they have clawed back most of Marvel\u2019s lead - and Marvel have been maintaining their lead by releasing a lot more titles than DC which fewer people read. This isn\u2019t good news for Marvel Comics. ",
