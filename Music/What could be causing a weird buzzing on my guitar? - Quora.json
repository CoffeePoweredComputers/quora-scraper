            "answer_text": "If the buzzing is coming from the tuning pegs and not along the fretboard, you need to look for loose parts up on the head of the guitar. Not all tuners are created equal (or equally); some are quite precise and all the parts fit together in manner that allows no \"slop\" or wiggle room, while others are not nearly as precisely manufactured and frequently have slack, backlash and what we guitarists refer to as \"slop\" (a general loose and lazy feel that requires constant fiddling and readjustment). The first thing to check would be if the tuners themselves are firmly installed and are firmly tightened against the head of the guitar.  Look for loose screws that hold the tuning machines onto the guitar's head. Are they all there (no missing screws in holes that have been built into the tuners' flanges and attachment points)?Are your tuners \"open,\" that is with the gears exposed, or are they covered. If open, then push the tuner's key up and down (in the plane of the fingerboard) and see if there is movement that allows the worm gear on the key's shaft to significantly separate from the gear. If so, get a better set of tuners or you can do a temporary fix by putting a small dab of viscous grease (I use petroleum jelly--Vaseline) on the teeth of the gear and that will help prevent vibrations from making noise between the gear teeth and the key's wormed shaft. You'll have to reapply the grease from time to time. While you are working on the open tuner, check the large screw that holds the gear onto the tuner's post (the part going through the head). If loose, tighten it gently but firmly.If covered, are the covers a separate piece that could be removed without removing the entire tuner from the head? Some inexpensive tuners are simply inexpensive \"open\" tuners onto which a separate, usually chromed, cover has been added to help keep out dust and to make the tuners look nicer. If you have covers, check each one for a tight fit. Tuners with separate covers are often the culprits of mysterious rattles on the head. I believe the John Lennon models have covered tuners, but the covers are press-fit onto the body of the tuners and tabs on the covers are bent over (or \"under\" depending upon your point of view) to permanently hold the covers onto the body. If they are Kluson, Gotoh, or Grover versions of the kind of tuner I think you might have, some will have a small hole in the cover near the top of the back face. This is a port into which one can add a drop of lubricant now and then. I use TriFlo and would only consider adding a lube once a year or so.Fully enclosed tuners rarely have rattles within and the body itself cannot rattle because it is all one piece.Push and pull on each tuner key to see if the entire body of the tuner moves when you do so. If the entire tuner body moves, you need to tighten up the tuner to the guitar or you need new (or better) tuners.Then observe whether the tuner's post (upon which you wind the string) is coming out of the front of the guitar at a right angle (90-degrees) and that it remains at that angle while you turn each tuner's key. If they have been installed  without making sure they are \"square\" with the head, you can get noise and rattles at some places along the travel of the post in it's elliptical path.Observe the ferrules through which the tuners' post emerge through the front of the guitar's head. They should be flush with the head and also \"square\" with the head and hole through which the tuner post emerges. Oft times, inexpensive tuners use a simple friction-fit ferrule that is pushed into the hole from the top. Better tuners have a ferrule that threads onto the barrel of the tuner as the tuner enters the back of the head. press-fit ferrules are often the cause of unwanted noise and are also prone to work themselves out of the hole on one side because the pressure from the string's pull is constantly only on one side.Now gently and with as much finesse as you can muster, lightly, ever so lightly begin to twist one of the tuner keys--but STOP as soon as you meet resistance. Go backwards just as lightly. Was there any slack between the time you touched the key and the time you felt it wouldn't move in either direction? If so, that is what we call \"slop\" (or backlash) and it can be a MAJOR source of buzzing and rattling on a guitar. Worn gears or cheap tuners often display this slop and there are no sure-fire ways to defeat it beyond a little extra gear grease.So, if you go through all of this and still don't find the source of the rattles when you play the bass-side strings, it is not likely to be the tuners. All the things others have suggested about keeping strings clipped close to the post, looking for loose parts, etc. may THEN help to find rattles that you hear coming from the head.  One more possibility is a loose truss rod. If the guitar was not properly set up at the factory or from the shop that sold the guitar, the truss rod may be loose within the pocket in the neck where it lies. A simple adjustment by a qualified tech or luthier will solve that and may even make the guitar play better. [...and now you might also understand why it costs some $$ to have a guitar tech or luthier examine and treat your guitar. We DO look at all these things and usually have ways to fix the problems. It is worth it to have your instrument set up by a guitar tech or luthier.] ",

            "answer_text": "Check every possible part that can vibrate. I've had that happen. Check the screws holding down the tuning pegs. Make sure there is no loose ends flopping around at the other end, underneath the bridge. Check the two guitar strap pegs, they have to be on tight! Check inside and outside the guitar for vibration coming from wires, volume/tone pot connections, cables pressing on something, etc. Various parts of the guitar will start vibrating at a certain frequency if they are able to. Check the nut. Check the connection of the neck to the body and the fretboard to the body, as that area can't be allowed to have a loose part. Check the strings; once on the guitar, make sure the extra length is cut off close to the pegs and no end of a string touches anything. You'll find it. If you've got string buzz, that should be easily found and fixed by raising the string, and/or it may require the neck being adjusted. Fretboards should either be flat or have a very slight dip in the middle, but that's an issue for an expert, not me. However, if you look down the fretboard and see a rise in the middle or it's not flat and fairly uniform from end to end, take the guitar to an expert guitar adjuster/luthier, ASAP, as a maladjusted neck may be a defect.
