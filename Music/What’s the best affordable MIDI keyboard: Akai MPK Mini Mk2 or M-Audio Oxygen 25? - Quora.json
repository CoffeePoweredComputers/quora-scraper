Remember, both of them already have similar controls (assuming this is the Oxygen with trigger pads). Try to get your hands on them. Check how the keys feel, and if they\u2019re big enough or small enough for you. See if you like the size of the whole unit. See if you prefer a joystick or wheel control. And so on. ",
