            "answer_text": "Most TV shows have a Music Coordinator or Music Supervisor who selects music \u201ccues\u201d to use in each episode. If the project has a a decent budget, the show has a Composer who writes specific pieces of music for each episode. This requires recording this original music so it\u2019s a much more expensive situation. As a show runs this original music is compiled into a \u201cLibrary\u201d for later use. This lowers the cost per episode. I believe the music you\u2019re asking about is music composed for each show so it\u2019s truly new and previously unheard. Some shows use a variety of the above to save time and expense. Watch the end credits for evidence of this. Also don\u2019t for get that an original score, written for the show usually has a theme that you\u2019ll hear in many different emotional variations from dramatic to comedic, to suspense\u2026 A good composer\u2019s artistry can cover a variety of problems and failures in a show\u2019s production.
