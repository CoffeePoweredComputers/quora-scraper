            "answer_text": "Most of the artists at the tribute concert performed a couple of their own songs and a couple included one or two Queen ones. This all happened at the start of the concert, before Queen came on. I\u2019ve attached a set list. Various Artists Setlist at Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert 1992 The main difference with the Bowie section is that he did his part within the Queen section, and was the only guest singer to do his own songs in their set. Looking at the set, these songs seem to be added to what looks like a very typical Queen set. So it isn\u2019t that other songs were necessarily taken out, but these were added in. In context, Dudes is a song that was around when Queen and Bowie were first popular, and given the inclusion of the big names of Ronson and Hunter on stage with Bowie, it would have been unthinkable to do this performance prior to the main set. \u201cHeroes\u201d having become a Bowie signature song is his only solo song included (I know he wrote Dudes, but he didn\u2019t have a hit with it, and it\u2019s associated more with MTH), and given the theme of love against oppression it fitted well with the set. Bowie and the members of Queen knew each other well. I believe Bowie and Taylor were especially friends. Having played the same venues and gigs, Top of the Pops shows and, as they said, slept with a lot of the same people, it made perfect sense for a short Bowie section to be included, after the performance of Under Pressure. As a slight aside, one thing I never understood, having seen both Bowie and Queen several times, is why they didn\u2019t do Under Pressure at Live Aid, when they were both there. But that, of course, is another question. ",

It was Mott the Hoople who had a number #3 hit with David\u2019s song before breaking up in 1974. Since they were not among the more current and popular acts it made sense to include Bowie in the performance with Ronson and Hunter. Queen got along well with Mott the Hoople and they remained friendly despite the fact that by the end of the tours Queen were viewed as stealing the show and some said they began as MTH tours but ended as Queen tours. At one point Ian mentored Freddie who had stage fright and was despondent after a show that didn\u2019t go over as well as usual. There have also been some collaborations with Brian, Roger and Freddie providing back up vocals on their songs and Brian has played guitar for Ian. Nice of the band to remember them and include them in the FM Tribute Concert. It was said that acts were chosen according to their relevance to Freddie so that\u2019s the relevance. Freddie and Ian years later.  ",

Heroes was lyrically appropriate for the occasion: \u201cWe can be Heroes, Just for one day\u2026\u201d.
