            "answer_text": "Pro: They sound cool and are pretty easy to actually play. They stay in tune really well after setup. Con: Setup is a dance of balance between 40-odd different adjustments, everything affects everything else, and getting it in tune in the first place is a nightmare. You have to repeat this every time you change strings, although if the new set is the exact same type as the old this isn\u2019t as hard as if they\u2019re different gauges. If you have a habit of resting your hand on the bridge, you\u2019ll go out of tune. This also makes palm muting interestingly difficult\u2026 not impossible, just tricky. Up to you whether that\u2019s a worthwhile tradeoff. Opinions vary, which is why there are lots of different bridges out there. But certainly I don\u2019t recommend Floyd Rose for beginners, since a beginner needs to be able to just play, not spend days or lots of money on setup work. ",

            "answer_text": "Pros: They stay in tune great. They are extremely responsive to small movements. They are comfortable, lacking sharp edges. Cons: Setting them up is a very fine balancing act of springs and strings. Everything is bolted together, and if you run out of adjustment space you basically have to remove a saddle and reattach it in a different spot. Once the fine tuners are out of adjustment you have to unlock the nut and lock it again afterwards. Some of these issues can be reduced by setting the bridge down on the body of the guitar. Personally I find the cons workable and enjoy the pros. ",
