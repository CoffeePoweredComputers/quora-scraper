            "answer_text": "Some music theory teachers may teach you the scales \"in order\" - ie C major/C minor, D major/D minor, E major/E minor, etc. However, I think one of the more effective techniques is to learn the scales in the order of how many sharps/flats occur in the scale - ie no sharps, 1 sharp, 2 sharps, 3 sharps, etc., no flats, 1 flat, 2 flats, 3 flats, etc. So you end up with something like this:  Which is exponentially easier to learn and remember. Notice anything interesting?  A whole lot of stuff should start jumping out at you, and you\u2019ll start noticing a WHOLE LOT of different patterns going on. There\u2019s at least 10 more going on. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Sharps and flats always appear in the same order: Sharps: FCGDAEB The first key with one sharp, F#, is G major. D major adds a sharp, C#, and so on. So when you get to A major, you\u2019ll have three sharps F C G. Flats: BEADGCF (you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s the sharps reversed) F has one flat, Bb. The next key that adds Eb to the existing Bb is Bb Major. I must admit, the quoted text is rather poorly written, I assume from a textbook. \u201cSharper or flatter\u201d is the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard applied to the concept of key signatures. ",
