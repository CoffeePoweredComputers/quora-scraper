            "answer_text": "Definitely buy the Yamaha RGX-101Z It's the best guitar for the price, though it's 15.5k it's the best guitar for the price. It's has a tremolo slot and the bending is easy.It's pick-up combo is HSH, so it's quite versatile.It's great sounding, solid wood with a solid shiny JET BLACK finish.You need to pair it up with an amazing amplifier which is also around 5 - 15k. I really suggest you to get a 20 or 30W Black star ID:Core series amp as it sound great with it. It's very good of its price. It's around 15k This guitar amp has a set of built in effects which are studio quality.The amp is very loud so you can jam with it with a band or even play in a small stageIt's really portableIt has stereo (2) speakers.Its very good sounding.Really a must buy and a tough guitar to get in shops you you should really call the shop before going there.
