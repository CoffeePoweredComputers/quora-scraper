            "answer_text": "So. You don\u2019t like musical theatre. Understandable, many people don\u2019t, but right now you\u2019re looking for a reason to why they\u2019re so bad and I am here to give you those reasons. 1. They\u2019re confusing When listening to music people often zone out and cease paying attention to the meaning behind songs, this doesn\u2019t translate well to musical theatre because almost all important plot information is presented in the form of song. 2. They\u2019re easy to mess up Because musicals are often preformed live, there is little room for error. If a line is forgotten there is no way to fix it, if a prop malfunctions there is no way to replace it. 3. It is, like many things, a matter of preference. I don\u2019t like popcorn, or Stranger Things, or jazz music, and that is fine. You (according to this answer) don\u2019t like musical theatre, which is also completely fine, some people just don\u2019t like live plays or singing or dancing or all these combined. While all three of these points being valid and there being many more reasons why someone could dislike musicals, the last reason is usually the most widespread. Often time things are just that, things, and disliking them happens. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it really depends on your taste. I don\u2019t find musicals \u201cbad\u201d at all (besides Cats, but\u2026 that\u2019s for another time). I quite enjoy theater, but I understand not everyone does. Some people may not like the music style, or even the fact that there is music- after all, that\u2019s pretty unrealistic. People don\u2019t burst into song spontaneously. I like the music and find that it often helps progress the story and allow the audience to understand the characters more. Even with the Broadway community, some people will consider someone else\u2019s favorite musical \u201cbad.\u201d I really is just all personal taste. As you can probably infer from my previous comment, I absolutely despise the musical Cats\u2026. but I have a friend who\u2019s seen it four times. ",
