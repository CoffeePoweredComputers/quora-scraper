            "answer_text": "\u201cGreatness\u201d is the most misunderstood concept on the planet. Advertisers, publicists, critics and reviewers spray the term around for the latest \u201csuperstar\u201d whose name may be forgotten within weeks. That being said, I have elsewhere flagged my definition of greatness - and I challenge anyone to better it - as being down to the three I\u2019s: Imagination (you couls also call it Inspiration) Innovation and Influence. This last in itself is a retardant to the speed at which a composer\u2019s greatness may be assessed as it takes a generation at least to gauge his - and historically I\u2019m afraid it has always been \u201chis\u201d- influence on those who come after. Great performers are easier to spot; no-one will ever hear a performance by Franz Liszt, but the eight or nine generations of pianists influenced by him are evidence of his greatness. Whether or not there are any \u201cgreat\u201d composers - and there have been great compositions in the last 50 years or so - there are without question thousands of very good ones. Why wouldn\u2019t there be? Countless students have gone through reputable music colleges and universities, have won competitions, have passed exams with distinction, have been handed the tools of composition from the best instructors in the world, yet how few of them can evaluate themselves in any terms apart from what their teachers and peers think about them? Similarly there is no end of very good doctors in the world, yet who among them will experience the Eureka moment of an Alexander Fleming? As in medicine, it is almost impossible for an aspiring composer to gain recognition, and therefore work, without going through all the hoops offered by an institution, and these, as we know only too well, are just as likely to stifle creativity as to promote it. Geniuses such as Schubert, Chopin, Wagner and Mendelssohn who flowered with little if any formal instruction were lived at a time when the \u201crules\u201d of composition were much more restrictive, and the choices less diverse, that they later became. A composer in our time who can assimilate the smorgasbord of styles ,genres and influences and come up with music which is distinctly and inseparable his or her own, would have to be a genius indeed. Even so, I am confident they are out there. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course there are \u2018great\u2019 composers. Lots of them. But most often, a composer is not usually considered \u2018great\u2019 until they are \u2018dead\u2019. There are scads and scads of terrific composers around today. In the past, \u2018great\u2019 composers wrote for opera or other dramatic works; today, composers write for modern dramatic works\u2014film and television. And in that field, almost everybody considers John Williams to be an amazing composer, possibly the best. We\u2019ll have to wait until he\u2019s dead to know whether he is \u2018great\u2019 or not.
