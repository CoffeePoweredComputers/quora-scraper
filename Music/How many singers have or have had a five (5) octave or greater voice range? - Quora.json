            "answer_text": "Not many singers have been blessed with a five octave or greater vocal range, the average being three octaves. But in terms of giant vocal ranges, three singers come to mind: Freddie Mercury  The ever so famous gay singer of Queen. Freddy Mercury was considered a god among singers, and he had an amazing near 5 octave range, ranging from a bass' F2 to a soprano's F6 (which apparently kept increasing with the years passing), but what was most impressive was his ability to jump from one end to the other effortlessly, without having a strain on his voice. - \"His technique was astonishing. No problem of tempo, he sung with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good and he was able to glide effortlessly from a register to another. He also had a great musicality. His phrasing was subtle, delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming. He was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word.\" -Montserrat Cabballe [1] Axl Rose  The singer of Guns N' Roses. He had the record for widest vocal range as a singer, beating Mariah Carey, a woman who would introduce her band by singing at the same pitch as their instruments (ikr?): He can sing from an F1 to a B flat 6, which is more than 5 octaves, and just a few semitones under 6 octaves. Honestly, what impresses me the most is that this guy smokes which reduces your maximal range. Mike Patton  As i said, Axl HAD the record for widest vocal range as a singer. The singer of alternative metal band Faith No More has been found out to have a massive 6 octave voice nearly reaching the 7th octave. He is now the current holder of the record for widest vocal range. Honorable mentions - Mariah Carey (Singer with a massive range who barely got beaten by Axl for the title)- Tim Storms (record for lowest note reached with the human voice)- Rachelle Ferrell (Jazz singer with a 6 octave range)- Elton John (Singer with a wide range)- Michael Jackson (He doesn't need a intro)- Tiny Tim (Amazing falsetto singer)- Paul McCartney (Surprised? He had a wider range than Johnny Cash and Elvis flippin' Presley - Tim Foust (thanks for the suggestion Lars Heijne!) Sources: [1] Mercury and Caball\u00e9 - \"Friends until the end ... Viva - Barcelona!\" ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve got at least one good answer I read but I want to take mine a different route based on a comment I wrote on a good answer In fact I\u2019ll just copy paste it as I wrote a lot I\u2019m engaging with the whole fascination about range and explaining how each singer even with their highest and lowest notes still don\u2019t explore their true range which is akin to comparing things based on x and y compared to introducing z and so exploring the 3 dimensional space of potential range\u2026 so I\u2019m not gonna name names as that\u2019s actually a google away so I tend to only engage in Quora in a way that my personal experience can\u2019t just be googled\u2026 not that I\u2019m against that it\u2019s just my preference ;) So here\u2019s the comment/rant I made which became an answer you might enjoy: I try to take this stuff with a grain of salt because seeing the focus on range and vocal control kind of irks me because my range is mighty as hell but not just up and down, I have many singing voices effectively because my voice changes so much from song to song and becomes almost unrecognisable from the previous voice and whilst I am doing it on purpose/taking advantage of this for my musical and artistic persona I\u2019m also kind of not\u2026 it now just kind of happens I have a non-association or disassociated method to writing songs in which I just let my mouth react however it wants to whatever piece I\u2019m playing or writing and that surprises even me with the results as for 8 years now my voice has changed often dramatically from one song to the next and I just have to hope over time that I kind of land on similar tonalities and voices or else any album I release is gonna sound like a mixtape or a very badly made top of the charts cd as the styles won\u2019t gel haha like if I explain that I wrote my song No Harm then immediately wrote I Don\u2019t Need Another Disease they are so different that once I mix and master them I could never dream of putting them anywhere near each other in the same album, in fact my goal is to create different artist and band names and kind of become the record label rather than just one band\u2026 I shall explore this divergence in style to the logical extreme and conclusion which will be that I become multiple unique artists much like when a painter masters more than one painting style and at first glance you might think there must be more than person with that name doing this So yes, I\u2019m using the automatic face value observation and comparison/pattern recognition each person naturally makes and toying with it for counter culture purposes to highlight that the traditional approach is massively reducing and homogenising our music industry and ourselves as we play up to it\u2026 so I doubt I\u2019m getting famous cos I swim against the tide unless I do this so well it can\u2019t be ignored So my voice and writing is very flexible and open but I'm not like famous or anything I'm just a guy and I just have my guitar and piano\u2026 maybe one day haha\u2026 I\u2019m not saying others like me don\u2019t exist I\u2019m saying I\u2019m not aware of them \u2026 Anyway in my opinion it isn\u2019t about range, honestly I see far more importance in storytelling and ambience and emotion and musicality for singers despite it being impressive to go all over the place or have those extreme ranges yet look at Alex Turner\u2019s lyrics (Arctic Monkeys) or Morrissey or even Eminem as a lyricist. I think people get too caught up in how technically advantaged some singers are, their gift of range, and don\u2019t concentrate enough on their actual emotional or poetic impact and value, how unique the artist is or what they bring to the table I find it boring and a little insulting if people concentrate on my range over my diversity but that could just be because that\u2019s always the first thing they notice and yeah I guess I play up to it live and yet at home I just do whatever I feel like and relax and let it come out even if I\u2019m like \u2018huh this isn\u2019t even my accent where did you come from?\u2019 haha Are they good storytellers\u2026 well yeah some of those names with high range actually were or are hahah but it doesn\u2019t disprove my point I\u2019m saying a small range isn\u2019t something to dishearten anyone from trying cos you might write a waaaaay better song than me even if you can\u2019t sing like I can and besides the more you do it the higher your range and control gets albeit to a limit that probably won\u2019t touch the names listed obviously Chris Martin of Coldplay always seemed like he struggled to hit those notes live but in recent years he seems to hold his own better\u2026 those early years they were studio artists more than live, able to review and edit and redo anything until it was right and they could do it segment by segment and now he has a semi decent range if you look at the extremes of his highest note to his lowest note\u2026 but how do we ascertain what his true in the flesh right now range is? We can\u2019t unless he runs through it several times over a year as he could record a very low note for himself at a time when he had a cough or something or was aiming lower It\u2019s not as simple to me as discussing range is my point because there is context to consider dont get me wrong Freddie Mercury for life and your answers will be naming good names haha but what I\u2019m saying is I personally have (and am happy to provide evidence in the form of YouTube\u2019s of my gigs) a vaster range of potential tonal changes and contrast than any of the artists you have named or I name ever did (as evidenced by their body of work) which is I believe largely to do with the brand they identified themselves with not an actual inability but hey they can\u2019t provide evidence to suggest otherwise so I claim more potential by default I'm not saying I\u2019ve got higher or lower notes I\u2019m saying they limit themselves in the bubble of a brand\u2026 look at Ben Harper the genre chameleon\u2026 yet it is still clearly always him singing I can mimic styles and place my voice pretty freely but I\u2019m not entirely sure what my actual range is technically. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I was just one of these 5 octave types or actually a bit of a freak tbh as I say this knowing what it sounds like but I do not know of any other singer like myself partially because I am using an approach similar to method acting in which I surrender my identity for the song/the role\u2026 but then again I did invent this music method which is entirely about identity swapping and taking advantage of my elasticity, modularity and philosophy to seek out ideas and surrender to the form they take\u2026. I just give the song whatever it needs i surrender my identity for the good of the song, if I need a bass growl to match the form then I do it and if it sounds way different than another song which requires something else I just let it flow and don\u2019t stop it with the notion of making a product or profit Actually you know who has a great ability to control his voice\u2026 Seth McFarlane\u2026 but yet he sticks to comedy or somehow his music lacks that core musical poetry to me but that could be personal preference and I\u2019m not overly familiar with his stuff Like I\u2019m not saying these people can\u2019t I\u2019m saying they never made a point of it so that to me is affected and reduced vocal range by boxing themselves in to only one box of identity, a brand It\u2019s like, I never heard a comedy song by Freddie Mercury, never heard him swear or use certain words in his music (could be wrong but I\u2019m fairly sure he hadn\u2019t done this by the standards I\u2019m applying)\u2026 his potential was much higher than he achieved not just because he died but because we as fans don\u2019t like meta we want it to be simple and familiar for it to be relatable so we push the \u2018singing is the sound of your soul\u2019 narrative and the \u2018you only have one voice\u2019 narrative but look at actors, the more they change the more we applaud\u2026 singers get a raw deal imo cos we are accused of losing touch with ourselves if we try to change and experiment too much so yeah I\u2019m going against the grain id probably be a lot more successful if I just learned cover songs and started a career as an impressionist but I\u2019m like creating unique artists and vocal sounds basically I\u2019m an actor and each song is sang by a character but for the most part I try to make my songs be about actual real life things for me and quote life or myself so it holds onto truth and so it is still art not just entertainment but yet it keeps me entertained and interested or I\u2019d get bored I want both, to entertain and to remain artistic and poetic or figure out a blend of both but I also want to make my identity and reputation about pushing every boundary and being experimental, sandboxing, playing and toying with form and expectation. Which sort of makes me a performance artist in a sense\u2026 I\u2019m not fond of labels im trying to explain what is far easier to just demonstrate hahaha we can\u2019t specialise in everything I guess but I\u2019m trying haha anyway my point was I literally am a singer who has mighty range and control but yet I would rather write incredible songs and lyrics cos that\u2019s what matters most to me as a songwriter and I just found myself ranting on a comment about range hahaha sorry about that lol happy to have a chat if you want me to justify my bold claim cos I\u2019ve got a youtube filled with albeit random and raw examples\u2026 I would hate to have peeps think I\u2019m a blowhard ;) ;) My point is I probably have 20 voices minimum (8 years of mixing it up means that is definitely an understatement) in one octave let alone the other ranges and I think people don\u2019t realise that when they focus on range alone i define a voice as; if I record and mix and master the song and follow the style and tone and it ends up so you can barely tell it is the same person\u2026 so Stewie and Peter Griffin are the same guy as Brian but you wouldn\u2019t know it until you see Seth swap between those voices or Justin Roiland is both Rick and Morty i use that as a singer and artist, that\u2019s my uniqueness and why I can just keep writing good songs without getting tired or bored or repeating my formula too much like I see many musicians doing these days ",
