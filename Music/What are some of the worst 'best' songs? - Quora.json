            "answer_text": "Lol well\u2026. Foster The People- Pumped Up Kicks  I picked this one as soon as I saw your question because back a few years ago I was in LOVE with this this song. Not really knowing that the entire time I was singing about shooting up kids until this year taking time to listen to the lyrics for once. Piece of lyrics- \u201cAll thee other kids with pumped kicks better run baby run, or i\u2019ll run my gun.\u201d Ke$ha- Die Young  During the time when this song was being played on the radio The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting had occurred back in Dec 14 2012 where 20+ people were killed by a young man named Adam Lanza who soon took his own life. With that being said, many people where outraged that this song was still being played all over stations in the U.S knowing innocent little children and adults where brutality killed back in Connecticut. As time passed by, much radio stations that I listen to back in Brooklyn, NY stopped playing this song completely. It sad to say that after all that I still find myself listening to this song here and there. Milli Vanilli- Girl You Know It\u2019s True  And last but not least, Milli Vanilli. Though the whole world had found out that thee entire time Rob & Fab (their names) was never really singing this track but I still love them dearly. This song was performed by them at the Grammy\u2019s back in 1990 where it was let out that this is not their actual voices. Winning two grammy\u2019s in total, both were revoked from them completely and made a T.V apology to everyone and their fans. With this in action, the industry black balled them for GOOD! And I mean real good. No one wanted to bothered with them but they still tried to revive themselves with their own voices creating an album called Rob & Fab.  Which did terrible in sales with only 2,000 albums sold. This led to company they were under to go into bankruptcy, soon shutting down completely. As time went on as they where about to go on tour with this album Rob Pilatus killed himself after a drug overdose (the one on the left) putting an end to Rob & Fab crew forever. It\u2019s sad because there voices really wasn\u2019t that bad. Sorry for making soo long haha. ",

In reality, it\u2019s a pretty goofy song. And you know what? When it comes on the radio or someone\u2019s stereo, I still listen to that ridiculous song. From beginning to end. Guilty pleasure, I guess\u2026 ",
