            "answer_text": "I can't say she is corrupting our youth but I think she is corrupting herself. Her actions aren't much different than those of other entertainers of her generation. When the Beatles were sweeping the country a lot of people said they were corrupting the youth but those are the 60 and 70 year old's of today. Most lived through it matured and lived a good life. Some got deeply caught up in the scene and changed the way the nation thinks. But whether or not it is better or worse is a matter of opinion. They caused the sexual revolution and in some ways damaged families and family values. At the same time they brought people together crossing racial barriers and perhaps exposed a lot of abusive and dysfunctional values that had been hidden and covered up.  As for this new generation it remains to be seen what good and bad will come out of it that will be passed on to the next. Miley is a part of that but as to how much actual and lasting influence she has can not truly be measured by the currant generation. ",

            "answer_text": "She's doing the youth of today a favor by inviting criticism and discussion of \"the arts\" and helping to sharpen kids' ability to filter inputs. Some see an entertainer work the media and say it's corrupting the youth, but when they see a capitalist exploiting everything he can to wring out the last nickel of profit out of human misery, they say it's the magic of the marketplace.
