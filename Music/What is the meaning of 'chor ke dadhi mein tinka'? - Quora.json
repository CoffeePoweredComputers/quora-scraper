            "answer_text": "Meaning: A speck in a thief's beard The ruler Akbar needed to test Birbal's knowledge, so one fine day, the Lord gave his ring to one of his court individuals and requested that he conceal it and go about as though it was taken. When Birbal came, the lord imagined about the taking of his ring and needed Birbal to discover the hoodlum. Birbal was amazingly smart. He realized that nobody from outside the court could even arrive at nearer to the ruler's private space, and in this way, he requested where it was last kept. He went close to the Almira where Akbar pointed that he had kept his ring before setting off to the restroom. Birbal put his ear on the Almira, as though hearing it murmur an insight. Sooner or later, he articulated, \"the Almira tells obviously, that the person who has taken the ring, has a piece of turf in his facial hair\". The person who had the ring promptly went after his facial hair and uncovered himself. Subsequently the axiom, \"Chor ki dadhi mei tinka\" with an English variation, \"A speck in a thief's beard\" -Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "This can be answered as \u201cA guilty conscience needs no accuser.\u201d Though it links to varios stories in India, I am mentioning the one famously listed under Akbar-Birbal Tales. The emperor Akbar wanted to test Birbal\u2019s intelligence, so one fine day, the king gave his ring to one of his court members and asked him to hide it and act as if it was stolen. When Birbal came, the king pretended about the stealing of his ring and wanted Birbal to find out the thief. Birbal was extremely clever. He knew that no one from outside the court could even reach closer to the king\u2019s private space, and thus he asked for the place where it was last kept. He went near the almira where Akbar pointed that he had kept his ring before going to the lavatory. Birbal placed his ear on the almira, as if hearing it whisper a hint. After a while, he uttered, \u201cthe almira tells clearly, that the one who has stolen the ring, has a blade of grass in his beard\u201d. The one who had the ring immediately reached for his beard, and exposed himself. Hence the proverb, \u201cChor ki dadhi mei tinka\u201d with an English variant, \u201cA guilty conscience needs no accuser\u201d ",
