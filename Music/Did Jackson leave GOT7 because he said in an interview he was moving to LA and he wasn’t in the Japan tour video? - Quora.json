            "answer_text": "Let me get one thing straight: Jackson did not leave GOT7. Have you seen the recent comeback? Unless we\u2019re mass hallucinating, I\u2019m pretty sure Jackson is there. He never said he was moving to LA. He was touring America to promote his solo songs because aside from being an idol, he\u2019s also a producer and the CEO of his own company. He\u2019s allowed to promote as Jackson Wang. He wasn\u2019t in any recent Japanese comebacks because 1) politics and 2) he already has a lot on his plate, juggling Team Wang and GOT7 that he doesn\u2019t even get enough rest. Jackson has been asked repeatedly if he\u2019s going to leave GOT7 (I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s already sick of the question. I know I am.) and time and time again, he replies he would never leave GOT7. That man is loyal to his friends. ",

I know everyone has answered, but I want to give proof. I know some people are newer fans or might not have seen a lot of comebacks, so this does not apply to them, but I remember there was this YouTube comment that summed it up pretty well. She said he had not been in the Japanese promotions for a while, so it was a surprise that people were not aware by now. Here is the official summary of the situation from kprofiles: From September 2017, Jackson won\u2019t participate in Japanese promotions, he will only go to Japan for special events such as award ceremonies (Statement of Sony, GOT7\u2019s company in Japan) GOT7 Members Profile (Updated!) There was a statement by the company that he left GOT7\u2019s company in Japan, but I do not remember where that is. ",

His contract to promote in Japan has expired and he didn\u2019t renew it. He has his own company now, and he\u2019s running that while staying in GOT7. They\u2019re literay his family, but as he said in the video, he also wants to make music that he enjoys too (JYP is known for pretty much controlling the songs thay are written, giving them little freedom). He actually got really upset in the video when people were asking why he left. People should stop jumping to conclusions until they\u2019re told by the person themself what\u2019s going on^^ ",

He might be moving to LA and have his own promotions and all (with his own team called Team Wang), but he firmly says in his own Vlive (and you could search for them on the internet, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it) that he\u2019s not leaving GOT7. He\u2018s trying his best to divide time between GOT7 and his own promotions, and he\u2019s feeling really sad when asked about that by fans so please stop. Also the reason as to why he\u2019s not in the Japan tour that I know of is because he got sick and JYPE pulled him out from the Japan promotions so he could rest and recuperate. Thank you for your question, and I hope you have a nice day~ \u2018w\u2019)/ (Also please help stream their new MV GOT7 \"ECLIPSE\" M/V and their other comeback videos in YT or other platforms, and thank you~ <333) ",

He said himself that he is spending half of the year promoting in Korea with GOT7, and the other half of the year promoting in China as solo artist. Thus, he has to pack 1 year of promotions in Korea within 6 months, and so is promotions in China. He's often caught sick out of exhautions when promoting in China, because his schedule is so packed. Imagine if he's still has to do promotions in Japan as well. He was doing promotion in LA for a short period (maybe 1 month), but he was not exactly move to LA. ",

To be honest the last couple songs GOT7 put out didnt do very well, they haven\u2019t really had much success with music or as a whole group since Hard Carry, i think eventually they will all end up terminating their contracts with JYP or at least cut their contracts to be in GOT7.

Also Jackson never moved to LA,he just promoted there like BTS,Black Pink or NCT. He might move back to Hong Kong in the future,but he has no connection with US. As for Japanese promotion, Jackson doesn\u2019t promote in japan. It might be something to do with politics or maybe not. When Got6 is promoting in Japan ,Jackson usually does his solo stuff in China. ",
