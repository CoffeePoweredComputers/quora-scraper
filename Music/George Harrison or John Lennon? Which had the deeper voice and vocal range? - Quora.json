            "answer_text": "I love them both, but it\u2019s no contest. By asking who had the \u201cdeeper voice\u201d and (presumably) wider \u201cvocal range\u201d, I suspect you are asking who was the greater singer by more objective criteria than just perception. If that were the question, Lennon easily wins, since he is one of the two or three best rock and roll singers ever. Harrison is a slightly above average rock singer. Who had the deeper voice? Depth in vocals can mean two things. \u201cThat guy has a really deep voice\u201d often implies that one is referring to low-pitch. But in singing, depth usually refers to having a little in reserve for moments that need to be belted. It can also imply a richness full of overtones rather than a thinner voice, even if that voice is melodic. Here John wins easily. George could never had hit the notes in \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d, especially at the end of a long recording session. \u201cHappiness is a Warm Gun\u201d would have vexed George as well. On the other hand, I think that John could have nailed \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d (although he would not have been happy about his performance). When it comes to range, there has been some documentation of this, and consensus is that George and John had largely identical lower ranges. The difference is that John had a slightly higher upper range. More importantly, he had a more comfortable upper range, and when he used it, he didn\u2019t sound as though he were straining. Interestingly, although Paul\u2019s voice is more throaty, and we often think of John but not Paul as a prototypical tenor, Paul\u2019s range was a touch wider than John\u2019s, and he was able to hit slightly higher notes. TL;DR. John had a deeper voice and a wider vocal range. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm no expert on singing, but you asked, so I\u2019ll give it a try. Firstly, your song, written by you, is always best for you, it suits your voice, your range, and type of song you do best. How this happens, I don\u2019t know, it just does. When Bands come together, they must share that musical identity, that type of music. To allow another musician to play a part of your song, is an act of trust, and love. The early days of pop chorus, in the songs, was there from their hard graft Hamburg days. George had the deeper voice, usually, he worked as a session musician with other Bands, I read a lot, so I can\u2019t remember the Band, but he spent all day, getting their singing harmony right. They never worked that hard on anything, totally loved George for driving them hard, and because it was George Harrison. Something, is one of the best love songs of all time. His song writing is exceptionally good, deeply spiritual, he used to have candles, and make the process sensual, he dressed up the Recording Studio, he loved mood. John Lennon was very business like in the Recording Studio, treated it as a place of work, in job done, out. John Lennon liked to compose very late at night, alone, usually in the kitchen, for reverb, and the dinner table to spread the paper out. This was John\u2019s way of getting deep emotions, he would throw it open to the Band, as a matter of fact. He found it hard to open up to the Band, and be the very hurt, vulnerable person, he really was. I think they understood, it shows in their songs, who didn't understand, was John himself. It was easier to get into Paul\u2019s songs first, for another Album, they were just more accessible. Obviously John was hurt by it, but it was no one\u2019s fault, but he harboured hurt, which comes out in his Playboy interviews. Peppers was different, in that the backing tracks of Paul and Ringo, laid down their parts, on Track 1, 2, and 3, to bounce down to Track 4, then leaving those there for other instruments, and vocals. This takes genius to work out the bass parts, and rhythm, without the Band, just on his understanding of the chord progressions. After this, Ringo said he learned to play chess on Peppers. I have never understood the line in How Do You Sleep, on the Imagine Album, \u201cso Sargent Peppers took you by surprise\u201d, a suppose insult song to Paul, because Paul was also a genius on Peppers. John did give advice on singing to Paul, I'm sure it worked both ways. John Lennon would sing like a song bird, if he had loads of reverb in his cans, (head-phones), I read this from his Engineer on Imagine. He was able to use his voice differently, brought out the best voice, for that type of song. John was a Rocker, George less so. John\u2019s very poor eyesight might have helped his concentration on singing, as our minds do work that way. I personally love all their singing, songs, and genius. If you are not familiar with the Beatles, do make the effort, it is wonderful joy. ",

John although his vocal range is rather limited, at least compared to Paul McCartney, still could pull-off other styles of vocal so well. He could do primal screaming style of vocal on songs like Yer Blues, I Want You (She's So Heavy), and I'm So Tired. John also could do wild rock n roll style of vocal on songs like Twist and Shout, You Can't Do That, and Revolution. George also could sing pretty well, but his vocal isn't as versatile as John. ",

I always considered George to have a deeper talking voice, but that too is debatable. ",

But based on the songs John wrote I would say John wrote deeper songs. But I will step aside and let the people experienced in music theory and song writing to determine which wrote deeper songs. To be honest George was my favorite Beatle. ",
