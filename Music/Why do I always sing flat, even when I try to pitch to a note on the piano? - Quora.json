            "answer_text": "You are not hearing it correctly or you are too easily satisfied with an approximate pitch match that is a little flat. Practice with an electronic tuner. (You can get a free tuner app fir your phone.). Grope around with your voice until the tuner tells you you have nailed an \u201cE\u201d for example. Now hold on to that and play that \u201cE\u201d on an instrument that is in tune. Keep checking yourself. Given that pianos are tempered, they are not the ideal instruments to tune to. Open strings on a viola or cello would be better but the stringed instrument has to be perfectly in tune. ",

            "answer_text": "You are probably grabbing in your throat, which can alter your pitch. Many beginning singers get the idea that THIS note is HERE and THAT note is THERE. Pianists are particularly apt to make this mistake. You will have less trouble if you think THIS is the DISTANCE between note one and note two. Then connect the two notes with easy breath, rather than separating them with silence or a glottal stroke (as in \u201cUh, oh\u201d). ",
