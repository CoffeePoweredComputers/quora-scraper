            "answer_text": "( written as a sufferer of depression, not to be taken as medical advice or opinion) First of all, maybe avoid listening to songs which have that effect on you. But also realise that sadness is a part of life and the fact that a song can have that effect on you shows you have an awareness , emotionality and sense of caring about something. If that awareness is about you only, like you are swallowing something which makes you feel less well, then seeing, feeling out something or someone else that the song might relate to could relieve the pressure. For example, let\u2019s choose any oldie (so it might not include the songs you know): Janice Ian\u2019s \u201c At Seventeen\u201d. Quite a personal song which could bring back unpleasant memories for some, but which is about one person\u2019s actual bitter-sweet reality -touching, sensitive, insightful. Knowing that some people have experienced some of those things in that song means the emotions do not have to be about you. It is a lament of sorts ( like Paul McCartney\u2019s \u2018Yesterday\u2019) but why not counter these melodies with \u201cFly too High\u201d and \u2018Follow the Sun\u2019 respectively ? Do happy, inspiring songs affect you negatively also ? Perhaps you think you do not deserve to be happy. Seeing a counsellor/psychologist or doctor, and getting a diagnosis and any suggested treatment might help. What about humorous songs ? and comedy ? Do you laugh, chortle, lighten up with these? Always worth a try. Monty Python anyone ? And there are lots of songs and tunes in movies. Do they help or hinder happiness for you? - happiness being the opposite of sadness for you ? Sometimes I find myself repeating the words of a song, or the tune over and over. I call it \u2018chewing the song\u2019 (or tune). A form of what I read is called rumination. If so, seeing a counsellor/psychologist or doctor may help. If you play a musical instrument or, more particularly, if you sing I can imagine that the evoked sadness/depressed feeling could be a real downer/ disappointment for you. For a while it might help to use another form of creativity to appreciate or express yourself and use your other senses e.g. draw; paint; look at and listen to nature; block your ears and sense the vibrations of music being played; smell the fragrance of a rose ( the Old World ones are best, I am told and make sure the thorns have been removed first!) or other things, perfumes, nature etc and; smell then taste things - favourite foods for example. Add music back in with these activities and see how you go !! Billy Joel\u2019s\u2019 \u2018Scenes from An Italian Restaurant\u2019, other stuff called dinner music, could evoke taste, sounds, smells. You will have your own associations between senses based on your experience of movies; when and where you heard a particular songs; memorable events and so on. Was it not Shakespeare who wrote in one play \u201c If music be the food of love, play on.\u201d? So, my best to you. And please don\u2019t knock my music appreciation, I do know more modern stuff too and enjoy it ! ",

            "answer_text": "Please don\u2019t listen to such songs if they upset you. However, sometimes I get a sad song stuck in my head, like an earworm An earworm, sometimes known as a brainworm, sticky music, or stuck song syndrome, is a catchy piece of music that continually repeats through a person's mind after it is no longer playing. Phrases used to describe an earworm include \"musical imagery repetition\", \"involuntary musical imagery\", and \"stuck song syndrome\". Earworm - Wikipedia Earworm - Wikipedia The only way I can get rid of a sad song (or an annoying song, for that matter) is to distract myself. Get up and do something else, watch a movie, go out, get away from it. That works for me in most cases. However, if you find yourself feeling more and more depressed, make an appointment with your primary care doctor and tell him/her what you are feeling. There may be something else going on with you that just isn\u2019t \u201csad songs\u201d making you feel depressed. Hope this helps. ",
