            "answer_text": "It would be hard to give a true top 10 of my favorite classical songs, since there are so many different types out there, so I will narrow this question down and answer my top 10 favorite piano songs. 10- Piazzolla - Libertango: this song is almost action like, and reminds me of a boss fight theme almost. It was hard for me to chose this number 10 spot, but I am going to give it to Libertango. 9- Chopin - Prelude in E Minor (Op. 28 No. 4): very slow sad song. Excellent use of diminished chords throughout. 8- Passacaglia \u2013 Handel/Halvorsen: I may be biased towards this one since I just heard it for the first time the other day, but this is a very good piece of music. It is very different and gives me a certain feeling that no other piece of music was able to do. 7- Chopin - Waltz in C Sharp Minor: very classic Chopin. Pretty song throughout, just a very well done piece of music. 6- Liszt - Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2: This song can be very hit or miss for me. When a really good pianist is playing, this is one of my top spots, but if there is any hesitation or lack of confidence from the pianist, than it can completely ruin it. 5- Chopin \u2013 Etude Op.25 No.5: This is the only song that uses \u201cwrong\u201d notes right. The dissonance in the first section is so brilliantly done, that there will never be another piece to replicate this sound. 4- Liszt \u2013 Liebestraum No. 3: Just a very good slow song. Does everything right. 3- Kreisler - Liebesleid (Love's Sorrow): I love when pieces tell a story, and this one does just that. The way it\u2019s structured is just so good, and is easily my favorite \u201chit you in the feels\u201d song. 2- Satie - Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1: I know this is going to be a little cliche, but this song is just so simple, yet so good. I have never seen such a simple piece evoke so much emotion into the listener, so you gotta give the song props there. 1- Chopin - Nocturne in E Flat Major (Op. 9 No. 2): This song will simply never be topped on my list. It is just the perfect song to me. Everything about it is perfect, and I can remember listening to the first time and just being in awe from how well done this piece is. This list is obviously subjective, and I recommend that the listener listens to performances by Kassia or Rousseau on YouTube, as both of them are very good pianists. Also try to limit the distractions around you to get the most out of each piece. Happy listening :) ",
