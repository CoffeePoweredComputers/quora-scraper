            "answer_text": "There are no wrong notes, just wrong \u201ceffects\u201d - not what was wanted.  Yes, you can play Minor pentatonic over major chords. Two common ways to approach it.  Firstly - every major has a relative minor. The sixth of the major is the relative minor. (C Major / A minor etc). This means that the notes of the relative minor are the same as the major, just starting from a different note ( the sixth note of the major). C Major - C-D-E-F-G-A-B-CA minor - A-B-C-D-E-F-G-AA minor pentatonic is A-C-D-E-G-A So if you play A minor over C Major you are still in key. But if you play A minor over A Major that is a different thing. A different effect. You get \u201ctensions\u201d of some notes being a semitone lower than the in the major - these are what we call \u201cthe blue note\u201d . A minor pentatonic is A-C-D-E-G-AA Major chord is A- C#- E The effect of the C Natural against the C# depends on timing and emphasis. Also implied in an A Major is a G#, but in the minor pentatonic it is a G natural, another blue note, a semitone below. This turns the major chord triad into a dominant 7th sound . From these beginnings you can experiment and expand into the great wonder that is music. ",

            "answer_text": "An entire genre of music is based on this very idea - Minor Pentatonic sound over Major Chord. That is almost a musical definition of blues! Blues would not sound like blues without Minor Pentatonic Scale being played over a Maj chord (or Dom7 chord). Minor Pentatonic over Maj chord gives you these half step approaches to chord tones and I think are part of why blues is lyrical. Half step bends to chord tones just seems to have a lamenting quality! Apart from blues, you can think of any Minor Pentatonic scale starting from 2nd, 3rd, or 6th degree of Major Scale as being doable. So in G Major, notice how A, B and E Minor Pentatonic all \u201cwork\u201d over a G chord, though some notes don\u2019t work so well. Your ears get a sense for what works after a while, without studying avoid notes. From there you can get as creative as you want, especially once you get into chord substitution/reharmonization and all the doors that opens for other scales that will \u201cwork.\u201d Once you come to that understanding, you realize how futile it is to think about all the scales that \u201cwork\u201d over some chord. Instead you start to realize that it is more important to let sounds arise in your head and coax them out of your instrument, at which point the chromatic scale becomes fair game! Have fun, Brian ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, a few different ways. This may even be the default in some blues and rock contexts; the chord is C7 and you might play C minor pentatonic or the C blues scale, which is C minor pentatonic plus the tritone F#. The truth is there\u2019s not really any difference between, for example, E minor pentatonic and G major pentatonic, so in some sense you can always play a minor pentatonic over a major chord. It\u2019s just a question of which minor pentatonic. Thinking like that, when the chord is G or G6 I might play E minor pentatonic \u2014 it\u2019s the same as G major pentatonic. When the chord is Cmaj7 or Cmaj9 I might also play E minor pentatonic, which picks up all the important tones in the chord (plus the bonus 6th aka 13th which sounds just fine). ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. In a blues/ rock context C minor pentatonic works over a C or C7 chord. Over a C chord, you can also play D minor, E minor, or A minor pentatonic - those all contain notes of the C major scale; if you like those sounds, use them. A minor pentatonic is the same notes as C major pentatonic, so that\u2019s kind of cheating though. You can play whatever you like if you like the sound it produces and you if you find a cool way to use it. B minor pentatonic will give you a jazzy sound, (it will make it sound like a Major 7 (#11) chord\u2026 other choices are more and more outside/ \u201cstrange\u201d. ",
