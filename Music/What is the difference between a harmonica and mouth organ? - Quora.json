            "answer_text": "Hello  Thanks for the A2A. Wikipedia states that Mouth Organ is a generic term for the family of instruments where the sound is produced by one or several free reeds, the reed(s) being put into motion \"by mouth\" (blowing or drawing) . The harmonica is one of the members of the family. The accordion is not. I would tend to say mouth organ is simply a popular word for harmonica, which can be used for both diatonic and chromatic harmonicas.   Laurent ",

            "answer_text": "A harmonica is a variety of mouth organ. Mouth organs use breath to vibrate reeds tuned to discrete notes. This is different from woodwinds like clarinets and saxophones, which use a single vibrating reed and change the note\u2019s pitch by modifying the length of a hollow tube. By the way, one nickname for the harmonica is a Mississippi Saxophone. Another is a Mouth Harp, or simply Harp. ",
