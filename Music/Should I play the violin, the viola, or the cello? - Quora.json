            "answer_text": "Well, I like the sound of the cello, too, but I just don't have room for it or the desire to carry it around. I got a viola. It's got the same strings as a cello, just an octave higher. I snagged a 5 string that sounds halfway decent, so I can play violin stuff, too. Then an I wanted an electric version of it. So I got a 5 string electric violin. Now, if I want to play the cello part, I could restring my viola with octave strings\u2026 they do make them. But the sound will be a bit weak compared to a real cello. My my solution was an Electro-Harmonix POG pedal. It can lower (or raise) the pitch of your instrument a full octave. Voila! Electric violin with a viola C string that turns into a chin-cello when I step on a button. All 3 in one instrument. But you should start with an acoustic instrument just to learn proper tone control and intonation. ",

            "answer_text": "Personal preference. Go with the sound quality that touches you the most. Violins and violas have an obvious portability advantage. If you are a student in the school orchestra, you will probably need 2 Cellos, as the standard size cello poses safety issues on a school bus (blocks the center aisle); need a cello at school and at home. Some schools supply school cellos for use in school for this reason. With the advent of the ChinCello this problem was eliminated. Now it is possible to have an instrument that sings cello tones, but in the more portable size of a violin/viola. Costs less, too. See link>> The AMAZING ChinCello ",
