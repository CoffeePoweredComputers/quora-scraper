            "answer_text": "Go to electric, dump the self-esteem trap (to high and your prideful, to low and your depressed). Either way the focus is on your self that is why they call it self-esteem. Focus on others and forget about the self. Forget what lies behind and press forward with some goals in life. Life it tough, unforgiving, and full of bad surprises. Plenty of reasons for self-pity. Life is full of electricity and as long as your breathing you have it. Look at Jesus, he was full of life and all the trouble he went through didn\u2019t slow him down from his goal. Terrible things, huge temptations, and everyone tried to get him to quit. Yet no self pity and a moment of great pain to finish his purpose. Very inspiring! ",
