            "answer_text": "The actual origination of that term doesn't come from his mouth but instead it got into the mainstream hip hop because of B.G and Tupac. Also, I'm pretty sure that Lil Wayne is not actually delusional about being the inventor of that term or anything but instead saying \"I invented bling\" is not literal but figurative, it gives the braggadocio to your lyrics. A similar braggadocio was done by Jay-Z in Otis when he said \"I invented swag\". ",
