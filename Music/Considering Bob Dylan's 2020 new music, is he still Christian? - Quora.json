            "answer_text": "The answer is more complicated because I believe he does consider himself more than just Christian. He believes in both the Old Testament as well as the New Testament. He is both Jewish and Christian and probably more than just those two religious philosophies. There is an excellent book called Bob Dylan \u201cA Spritual Life\u201d. That shows his life long spiritual quest all through his music from the very beginning. ",
