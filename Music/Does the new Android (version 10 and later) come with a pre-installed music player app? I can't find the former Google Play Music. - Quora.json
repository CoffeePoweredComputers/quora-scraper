If streaming music from the Internet is what you\u2019re seeking, Google\u2019s YouTube Music app is installed on all new Android Devices. Of course there is the Chrome Browser as well which is capable of streaming from music websites. The Google Play Store also hosts several music apps, such as Pandora and Spotify. Google Play Music is a thing of the past, it\u2019s no longer downloadable, supported or functioning. ",

            "answer_text": "Google Play Music is gone, sadly, replaced by Youtube. The new one is YouTube Music, which despite the name also plays local music, but\u2026 I\u2019m not a fan at all. I switched to JetAudio, but there are many other music apps that are IMHO much better for local music. Combining local and streaming is a little rarer, but Spotify is probably king there. ",
