            "answer_text": "Well there\u2019s lots of jazz stations that have probably played songs 20m + in length There are also indie stations that have played live cuts from bands like the Grateful Dead, Phish, et al. In fact SiriusXM has a Jam Band channel. But if you\u2019re speaking of songs that were nominal hits on broadcast radio then it has to be the full, 17-minute-version of \u201cInna-Gadda-Da-Vida\u201d by Iron Butterfly. Rock fans loved it because it was a great song to drop acid to. DJs loved it because it was long enough to let them go to the john, roll a fattie and flirt with that cute-sounding chick on the phone. One classic rock station in Baltimore used to \u2014 well into the 90s \u2014 have a weekly Friday night feature where they played the song. (By that time, it wasn\u2019t a song you just plop in anywhere on an FM playlist \u2014 it was always quite polarizing \u2014 but late on a Friday night was the perfect time for it.) Now, the band Yes, has some long ones: \u201cClose to the Edge\u201d (18 mins); \u201cThe Gates of Delirium\u201d (21 mins); and all four side-long-songs from the snozzzzzzzzzzzzzze-fest Tales of Topographic Oceans (ranging 18 mins - 21 mins) ; but none of those, IIRC, were regularly played on FM radio.

I worked in 2 of my local radio stations (not my real job, both radios are owned by one of my best friends) and the longest songs I have played myself are also the longest songs I have ever heard being aired. These are a few I recall from the top of my head: BURZUM - Det Som Engang Var (14:21) IRON BUTTERFLY - In a Gadda da Vida (17:03) OPETH - Black Rose Immortal (20:14) PAYSAGE D\u2019HIVER - Der Baum (24:34) GRETA VAN FLEET - Lover Leaver, Taker, Believer [live] (26:35) (this one I suggested/requested my friend to air in the midnight show and continues to be aired very often) JEAN MICHEL JARRE - Waiting for Cousteau (46:56) ",
