            "answer_text": "Yes, obviously, There probably be a few reasons not to like heavy metal music like may be you are fond of melancholic tunes, instrumentals or soft music but there goes a huge list of bands which will make you a bigger fan of heavy metal music. Black Sabbath: The band from United kingdom will make you fall in love with their music, I guess you have heard the name, Ozzy Osbourne,Tony Lommi Metallica: One of my favourites, Very few guitarists are there with such unique technique and versatility, Mr. Kirk Hammett.Give it a go if you haven't listened to their music.Iron Maiden: The band from UK is the pioneers of the new wave of British Heavy Metal.Megadeath: Dave Mustaine formed the band after his dismissal from Metallica in 1983. Credited as one of the genre's big four along with Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer. Former lead guitarist Kiko Loureiro is my all time favourite. Judas Priest: Frequently ranked as one of the Greatest Metal Band of all time, Guitarist K.K.Downing has some jaw dropping skills,and also the bassist Ian Hill .To be honest there are many and to include them all will make it a huge list, Pantera,Ac/Dc,Deep purple, System of a Down,Guns N' Roses, Dream Theater,Sepultura and the list continues. To all those who aren't much into heavy metal,give it a go,you will like it for sure. Thanks. ",
