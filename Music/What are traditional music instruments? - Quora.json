            "answer_text": "Q: What are traditional music instruments? Musical instruments with some tradition to them. Usually, very old. Sometimes ancient. I love learning about and playing traditional instruments. It is a passion for me. For my sins, I mainly enjoy playing the Harmonica[1], which has a very proud tradition, going back over nearly two hundred years. But two hundred years is as nothing to the history of many traditional instruments. I also play the Mandolin, with a fine pedigree going back well over three hundred years.[2] In the same instrument family, my friend Mark (the whistle player in our band), also plays the Cittern, with direct ancestors going back even further. [3] Sharing with Mark in playing our two traditional instruments together every week for the last eleven years or so, has been one of the greatest joys of my life. I had thought both Mandolins and Citterns were members of the Lute Family. [4] And certainly this is how they're often classified. However, on following my nose to a few links while checking for this answer today, I find there is some disagreement amongst musical instrument scholars about this. The Wikipedia entry for Cittern (already cited) addresses this briefly. The thot plickens! The Lute itself has even older origins, going back some thousands of years. [5] Indeed traditional, and most intriguing.  [ Picture brazenly filched from Google Images ] Traditional instruments! Long have they brought joy, and long will they continue to do so!
