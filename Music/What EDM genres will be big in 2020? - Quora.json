It is a bastardised term used in America for dance music (which is so weird because we got dance music from you to begin with ! Chicago House ? Detroit Techno ? Hello\u2026 is this thing on ?!?!) Check out genres on Beatport and Discogs ; DJ & Dance Music, Tracks & Mixes Explore Electronic on Discogs Trap/ Future Bass and Nu Disco are new to me ! ",

            "answer_text": "Towards the end of the decade, I\u2019m picking some new form of happy hardcore perhaps. We have started to dig into revival as a culture, and going back would mean either eurodance, synthwave (which we already have), or early house/hardcore. Obviously these will be re-invented. But something less dour, and more happy. Something along the lines of pendulum could be steered in a more euphoric direction. A new breakbeat hardcore. For now, it\u2019s just what we have, nothing is changing, and music is stagnant. ",
