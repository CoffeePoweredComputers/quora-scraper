            "answer_text": "There was a host of great bands in the 70s that never made the impact they should\u2019ve. These bands managed to get record contracts but huge competition and impatient record companies meant their opportunities were limited in the main. Lack of promotion and backing meant an enormous struggle and a great deal of frustration leading to contracts not being renewed/extended and band splits. String Driven Thing were a quirky Scottish outfit without a drummer in the lineup and recorded 2 albums. The first one is well worth a listen, the second I can\u2019t vouch for as I\u2019ve never managed a listen. It did have the ignominy of supplying a hit single for The Bay City Rollers, though. Beckett were an excellent hard rock band from the north east. Most of the the tracks from their only album are available on YouTube and you will be rewarded if you manage to hunt them down. Strife were a three piece power group from Liverpool with a pretty unique sound. They produced 2 great albums and a ferocious live album which surfaced long after their demise. Nutz were another great band from Liverpool. The first of their three albums is worth investigating. The second had a couple of standouts including a brutal version of Dylan\u2019s \u201cOne more cup of coffee\u201d.Marseille were another hard rocking band from Liverpool (I\u2019m not biased, honest). I saw them at The Moonstone in a previous life as AC/DC in about 1975 dressed like a cross between The New York Dolls and Aladdin Sane. They included Neil Buchanan of TV Presenter fame. I also saw them in striped jerseys to underline their new name doing their signature song \u201cDo it the French way\u201d. Great stuff. Glencoe were a Southern band, I think, despite the name. Their 2 albums were outstanding before they imploded. The bassist, Norman Watt Roy, went on to play in Ian Dury and The Blockheads. Ethel the Frog came a bit later and were part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. I think they only made 1 album , which included an incredible version of \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d. Girl were a Southern NWBHM band with an androgynous persona. I think they faded away after 2 albums. However, their debut contained my favourite NWBHM track of any band - the outstanding \u201cMy number\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "For me it\u2019s \u2018Jellyfish\u2019. The best melodic pop rock since The Beatles. While I like ELO for example, I think a lot of ELO is a pastiche of not just Beatles music, but of a particular era of Beatles music. Jellyfish is clearly heavily influenced by the Beatles, but still wholly original and not as locked into a particular mode. They made incredibly great music. I think the issue is just at the time that they were trying to make their way, popular music wasn\u2019t in that vein. What you had was primarily the last days of hair metal passing the baton to grunge and alternative music and hip-hop and R&B. Jellyfish were just kind of out of place in the era. They only made two albums, but both are worth listening to in perpetuity. Choice 1a for me is \u2018Apollo Subshine\u2019. seeing this band live many times is the most fun I Have had at any live shows. They made three albums in the mid 2000\u2019s. They are slightly experimental rock, They made three pretty different records. The first album is melodic, pretty and nice. The second is a little harder, bluisier and experimental. The 3rd is far more experimental, and then they stopped. It\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t see them live anymore, while the records are good, the live shows were just cranked up to 11ish. ",
