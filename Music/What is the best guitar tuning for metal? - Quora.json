            "answer_text": "Standard Tuning. You don\u2019t need a drop tuning or any of the wacky tunings in modern metal that make the guitar sound like farts. Those wacky tunings are one of the reasons Metal music sounds so awful these days (the other main reason is cookie monster screaming vocals that also sound like farts). Forget this, I\u2019m going to give you some better advice for tone. Most Metal, as in the original genre was done in standard tuning. All the old greats; Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Dio, Deep Purple, Mercyful Fate, etc etc. They all used standard tuning. The real key to getting a solid Metal tone is in the distortion and creating a tone that has a good crunch for palm muting on the low e string and sustain for notes to ring out. All you really need is a good guitar with a humbucker in the bridge position (you can get Metal tone out of single coils too but it takes more work), an overdrive pedal and a good distortion amp. The most common set up is to run a humbucker equipped guitar through a Marshall amp with an overdrive pedal. As for your amp settings, the most infamous Metal tone is from \u201cscooping the mids\u201d as the old saying is. This is where you turn the mids down and increase the bass. The bass will give you that punch for a crunchy sound on the low e string. You can set the treble however you like but keep in mind that too much treble will make the guitar sound \u201ctoo bright\u201d. Most Marshall amps have a \u2018presence\u2019 setting, which is a mid-boost and can be useful for getting extra punch without having to use the mids. Treble can be used however you want. Your goal really is to get the EQ set to get that crunch sound for palm muting and power chords ringing out. Don\u2019t worry too much about the amp though, cause the overdrive pedal is more important. There are two pedals I\u2019d recommend for Metal tone - the Digitech Death Metal pedal and the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer. The Death Metal pedal can be bought relatively cheap for around 30 dollars. As for the Tubescreamer, that is a classic pedal for both Metal and Blues guitar. Blues master Stevie Ray Vaughan made this pedal famous, but Marty Friedman of Megadeth also used it with his heavy distortion sound. It\u2019s a common saying that the overdrive pedal is where you get the bulk of your tone in Metal. If you want to use another distortion pedal added in here, you can try a compressor. I\u2019m only mentioning a compressor cause it\u2019s a requirement with getting that extra crunch when you have a guitar like the Stratocaster or Telecaster with single coil pickups. Strats and Teles can do the Metal thing, but they need an extra boost with the compressor alongside the overdrive pedal. (BTW if you like regular single coil Strats, the Texas Specials are a GREAT pickup set for doing Metal). A bonus effect you can throw in is a noisegate, something that is a requirement if you are using single coil pickups cause you\u2019ll need to cut down the 60 cycle hum with all that distortion (if you have the noiseless single coil pickups, you will still get a bit of a buzz from all the pedals hooked in). The noisegate will get rid of the buzzing from having your pedals hooked in. A bit of delay also helps for Metal tone. I wouldn\u2019t recommend Reverb, but there are some metal guitar players who make great tone with using a bit of it. Your amp don\u2019t have to be Marshall, that was just an example. IMO Fender\u2019s Super Sonic amps work brilliantly for Metal and that amp flies under the radar and isn\u2019t used much. I seen a guitar player use one at a local gig and was impressed. It has two gain knobs with one of them working as a compressor. Stick with standard tuning and work on your tone. ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who plays lots of different types of modern metal and someone who has a lot of experience with different guitars in the application, I\u2019ve used numerous different tunings throughout the years to experiment and determine what sounds best tonally for myself and my style. I play a lot of rhythmic based music but I\u2019m also known to dabble in technical death metal. While I don\u2019t feel there is any one best tuning for all styles, my current favorites are as follows: For 6 string standard scale instruments, drop C (CGCFAD) and C standard (CFA#D#GC) are my most used. My reason for this is because it\u2019s relatively simple to set up with medium-heavy strings without much hassle. Also look for strings with a wound G string for those low tunings; it does wonders for your intonation. I keep my hardtail bridges in drop tuning while I keep my Floyd Rose-equipped guitars in standard. Just my preference. For 7 strings I use drop G# (G#D#G#C#F#A#D#) Again just my preference because its not hard to set up with normal strings. When we get into really low tunings it\u2019s sometines hard to find that perfect pack of strings for proper intonation. I usually use 11\u201362 gauge strings in this type of tuning. For 8 strings I use 10\u201374 gauge and I usually tune to F Standard (FBbEbAbDbGbBbEb). It\u2019s easier to navigate and easier to make chords all over the fretboard in a standard tuning. Bottom line: Play with different guitars, string gauges, pickups, and bridge types to find what works best for your music. There is no single best tuning for any style of music, especially metal. The best tuning for you will depend on what your playing and how you\u2019re playing it. ",
