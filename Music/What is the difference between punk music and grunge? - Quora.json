            "answer_text": "A2A Music genres are always evolving because they are defined not only by form, function, instrumentation, and similarly styled music progression, but also by time period (And often by socioeconomic and political factors as well). First, punk is defined by a specific period of time; well two periods of time, actually. The first wave of punk began in 1976 and ended around 1979 (Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders said that heroin was largely responsible for the 1979 ending). Punk would be revived in the early 80's and find itself squeezed into a number of subgenres, including hardcore, pop punk, horror punk, Oi!, etc. Punk was gasping its last breaths by the time Nirvana hit it big in 1991. While a vibrant music scene was already underway in Seattle, no one outside of the Pacific Northwest even knew anything was going on there until Nirvana shined a spotlight on the scene. Enter grunge. This was the natural evolution of punk, and ultimately what punk became. While grunge was informed by punk, it had a different form and style. It certainly wasn't as politically motivated or subversive as punk, as evidenced by its quick and widespread popularity. Ultimately, grunge largely became \u201ccrying in your spoon\u201d music (the name I call it because it's the only genre I know of that was both born of, and destroyed by, heroin). And then poof: it disappeared, along with the flannel shirts and goatees. ",

            "answer_text": "Punk music: Nirvana Grunge music: Soundgarden That's really all there is to it. Flannels were actually an \u201cEddie Vedder\u201d thing. I think I've seen Kurt wear a flannel like, twice? Lol What's odd is that Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder actually liked a lot of the same music, but when it came to a true love of Punk rock, Kurt Cobain probably beats everyone I've ever known to enjoy punk music. He seemed to be obsessed with it, quite honestly. Liking everything from Rites of Spring to Frightwig, and from Butthole Surfers to the Wipers. Black Flag, MDC, Bad Brains, Clash, PJ Harvey. He even liked that awful album \u201cPhilosophy of the World\u201d by The Shaggs? He was \u201cDedicated\u201d to the punk genre, as I feel everybody else from the grunge era was probably just a fan of punk music, along with many other things. Not to say Kurt didn't love a ton of other different shit besides punk as well. ",
