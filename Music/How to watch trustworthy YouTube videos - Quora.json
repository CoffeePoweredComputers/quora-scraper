            "answer_text": " Youtube is one of the biggest websites for uploading and sharing videos. Most of us, like me, every day at least one time watch a video from youtube, directly or indirectly. As all of you know, youtube is easy for everyone to upload and share any video freely. But this \u201cany\u201d really means any video?? Among different concerns about youtube, two issues are more important; Privacy policy and copyright. In this post, I am going to talk about the privacy policy for watching or sharing videos. Let\u2019s see is Youtube really trustable?? For watching youtube videos (except restricted videos) you won\u2019t need a youtube account. But, if you wanna upload videos, post comments, flag videos, or watch restricted videos you need to create an account. For creating an account, the website asks you personal information such as your age and email address. Most social websites like \u201cFacebook\u201d use these kinds of information for commercial and marketing use but this not gonna happen in youtube. Youtube will not send you advertising email to your inbox over and over. They just use this address for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). The other matter is about cookies (As we mentioned about cookies in earlier posts). Youtube uses cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalized content, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. Whether other users can see your personal information or not, when you share video or comment, is your choice. Normally, it doesn\u2019t show your email address or any other information except your name (which can be fake). Anyway, if you like to share your profile with others, you are free. ",
