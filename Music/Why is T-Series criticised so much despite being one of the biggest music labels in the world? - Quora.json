            "answer_text": "Let me start with the story of how T-Series was formed.  This man Gulshan Kumar, in 1983, used to sell fruit juice in Delhi, when he realised that audio cassettes were expensive, and many people couldn\u2019t afford them. So, he used to pirate the cassettes and sell them at cheaper prices. He then utilised the loopholes in the copyright laws and started releasing the cover versions of songs, under the brand name T-Series would then flood the market with these songs. T-Series was a profoundly disruptive force in the Indian music market, in large part because it was a tremendously successful pirate. The company built its catalog through a variety of quasi-legal and illegal practices ... [T-Series] engaged in more straightforward copyright infringement in the form of pirate releases of popular hits, and it often illegally obtained film scores before the release of the film to ensure that its recordings were the first to hit the market. To keep it short, T-Series had zero respect for music and its creators. All it wanted was money which it earned loads of.  Cut to 30 years later, T-Series has almost monopolized the Indian music market. T-Series still exploits loopholes in the law. In India, no musician (composer or singer), director or producer owns the rights of a song. Only the music label which produced this song owns them. So, T-Series being the biggest music label in India owns the rights of many popular songs. And to make money, it simply remixes these songs destroying the soul of the original and giving no credit to the original creators. There are tons of wonderful songs destroyed mercilessly by them solely to earn money.  T-Series treats music only as a means to earn money. It doesn\u2019t give a sh*t about the quality of music. That\u2019s the reason it treats an album of a movie as few individual songs and assigns them to different composers, like this.  (Taken from Pati Patni Aur Woh (2019 film) - Wikipedia) By doing this, it manages to get a different \u2018flavour\u2019 for each song which just helps get more views on YouTube. Also, many of the above songs are either remixes or rip-offs. When different composers compose music for a movie, a movie compromises on the quality of music. That is the reason many acclaimed Bollywood composers like AR Rahman, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and Vishal-Shekhar avoid working with T-Series. These folks respect music. To keep it short, T-Series has zero respect for music and its creators. All it wants is money which it is earning loads of. Basically, it is back to square one. ",
