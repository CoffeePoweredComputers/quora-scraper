            "answer_text": "There is a lot involved to achieve technical mastery of this piece. One small tip I will give you that I discovered by accident (though I make no claim of inventing it), is to practice the right hand lines that take place using 5 and 4 (and sometimes 3) independently. For instance, you would begin by playing the descending line starting on the high F as just a descending chromatic scale followed by successive ascending figures of E-D, E-D, E-D followed by descending lines of D-C, D-C, D-C and so on\u2026. The same goes for the middle left hand section, but it\u2019s fingers 1,2, etc\u2026.. Do this alternating accenting on strong beat of every other note and then switch to a triplet feel accenting on the \u201c1\u201d of each triplet set. Do this hands alone until it feels comfortable and you can switch from back and forth from triplets back to every other note accented. Then add the left hand. This will help you get a good feel for getting the piece up to tempo. Once you are up to tempo you can concentrate more on touch and tone with a real solid muscle memory and not rhythmically wedded to any particular strong beat for those \u201cflurry\u201d lines. Good luck!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Become fluent in polyrhythms by making them your friends. Get Brahms, Franck and other composers and learn polyrhythmic passages until you can play them with ease and enjoyment. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but when I come across a rhythmic figure I can\u2019t really do right, I can play through it, but I get a \u201cungh\u201d in the pit of my stomach, even just a slight uneasiness, but it is not welcome. I must conquer the thing. My first wrestling match was with 3 against two (triplets vs. straight 8ths). Like the musicians Mendelssohn complained about, I made triplets into a muddy quarter and two eighths to accommodate and hoped the rest of the piece would make up for it. I got less muddy, but still no true 3 vs. 2. So, confronted with a Franck organ piece which relied on those things, I had a knock-down, drag-out with myself, isolating me in the practice room until I came out ahead, then repeating it days later to see if it really took. My teacher had taught me \u201cone - twoANDthree\u201d. I still think this sometimes, but it is too lumpy a thought to make the music smooth. The parts must glide over one another like a fast bird and a slow bird. Singing one part while playing the other can help (singing is often a good thing to do, anyway). \u201cThe right hand does not know what the left hand is doing\u201d, Matthew six-three - good advice in the Sermon on the Mount, and in piano playing, too. I grew up as an organist, and was deathly scared of Chopin. I still can only play some etudes and nocturnes, and the Scherzo in C# minor still sits on my shelf, smirking at me, waiting for me to open it up and - alas, failure! one more time. As Mark Andrews points out, it simply is hard, or it\u2019s hardly simple. The facility will catch you by surprise, I think. One minute you will not feel it, and then it will become a part of you, without knowing exactly when. If you are young, the better, so you\u2019ll have lots of years to enjoy the master, the pianist of pianists, Chopin. ",
