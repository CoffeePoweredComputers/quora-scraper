            "answer_text": "Alright, here we go. These are my opinions and you are allowed to disagree with them, but be nice about it. BTS are overhyped, not overrated. I\u2019m not an ARMY anymore, but I feel like some ARMYs exaggerate just how good the members really are. They have a good vocal line, but it\u2019s not the best in the industry. The members are good at dancing, but not overall they aren\u2019t the best in the industry. They do, however have one of the best rap lines in the industry.Everglow has become Mia and friends. I feel like Yuehua Entertainment is trying to give her the infamous Jennie Kim treatment, which isn\u2019t fair to Mia and is also extremely unfair to the other members of the group. The line distribution for some of their songs is just wack. However, we should blame the company for this, not Mia.Itzy isn\u2019t an all visual group. This may sound a bit mean, but I have to agree with this view. I\u2019m not however, supporting the hate that certain members receive because of this. Yuna is weak for a visual and I don\u2019t really see the hype around her looks. Yeji only stands out because of her cat like eyes. Without them, I don\u2019t think she would be as pretty. I also don\u2019t understand why people say Lia should be visual. She looks pretty average to me. However, do remember that beauty is subjective.Big 3 privilege is earned. SM, JYP and YG have produced groups which have helped kpop to develop as a genre and some of their groups have had the biggest impact on kpop. These three companies have proved to the South Korean public that they produce groups that have the best visuals, dance the best and sing the best. Moaning and complaining about the privilege certain groups have just because they\u2019re from the Big 3 is unfair. They\u2019ve earned these privileges. Getting into the Big 3 isn\u2019t easy and for a good reason.I don\u2019t find Hwasa attractive. I\u2019m not trying to come off as rude, but I find her features too harsh for me and can understand why many kpop fans don\u2019t find her attractive.BTS only won so many daesangs this year because Bighit is partners with CJ E&M, who own MNET. Sorry, not sorry.TXT is only popular because of BTS. If they weren\u2019t from Bighit, then they wouldn\u2019t be as popular as they are today. Majority of their fans are ARMY, who are either Bighit stans or support them because they support BTS.Seventeen not winning the Best Dance Performance Male Group daesang is a joke. For the past two years they won it, but now when they\u2019ve come out with their best choreography they don\u2019t win it? Boy With Luv\u2019s choreography was way easier than Fear\u2019s and it actually broke my heart when they didn\u2019t win.Most of Stray Kids\u2019s songs are noise. Honestly, I know that so many people will disagree with this, but a lot of their songs give me a headache. I think that they should take a break from self producing and that if they do, they could have their breakthrough song.Woojin left Stray Kids for a reason. If he broke a rule and did something stupid, then he should\u2019ve left. This may be harsh, but it\u2019s true. If he potentially jeopardised his group\u2019s future, then it only seems right that he should leave.The amount of hate Blackpink receive from the kpop community is absolutely disgusting, especially Jennie. So many kpop fans love to bring these beautiful, talented girls down just to promote their faves and that is just low. So low. It\u2019s not their fault that they only come back once a year and that YG won\u2019t let them have a full album. There\u2019s a reason that they got into YG. Constantly belittling Jennie for being \u2018lazy\u2019 is just annoying now. She was clearly going through something at the time and YG didn\u2019t let her recover, which just show how much of a piece of sh*t he is.YG gambling his artists profits was just so wrong and proves how much of a bad person he really is. I just don\u2019t understand why he would do that. Now his artists can never get their hard earned money back, which is just wrong. What was the point of them working hard to earn money if their CEO will just gamble it away? Once again proves how YG is a bad person. He purposely sabotaged the group his wife was in: Swi.T just to get with his underage wife at the time. Also, his \u201clove story\u201d is really weird and kind of disturbing.It\u2019s ok if Wonho doesn\u2019t return to Monsta X. He made his choice, even if it was a rushed decision and we have to respect it. If he won\u2019t come back, then trending hashtags and trying to get him back is probably making it worse for him. If he doesn\u2019t want to come back, then he doesn\u2019t and nothing will change how he feels.Fancy deserved song of the year, not Boy With Luv. Enough said.I don\u2019t like the ARMY, at all. At this point, nothing can really change my mind. Feel free to try and convince me, though.Ateez will be the next big thing, not Stray Kids. They\u2019ve already achieved so much in just one year and have a huge international following. I have a gut feeling that they will blow up in the near future. Stray Kids could, but it\u2019s quite unlikely now.Oneus have a bright future ahead of them.NCT\u2019s breakthrough song could\u2019ve been Boss, if SM didn\u2019t do them dirty. That song is extremely popular and if SM let them promote it then it definitely could\u2019ve been their breakthrough song. So many idols have covered the song and I\u2019m 100% sure that this would have been their breakthrough into the industry.I only find Ateez\u2019s San and Hongjoong attractive. A lot of people say that Yeosang reminds them of Taeyong, but I don\u2019t really see it. People say that Mingi is also a reason they\u2019re so popular, but to me he doesn\u2019t really stand out.Heechul and Momo being happy is all that matters. The relationship is between those two. It\u2019s not Heechul, Momo and stan Twitter. As a grown woman, Momo can date whoever she wants. All of these people hating on them should have the same energy for Beyonce and Jay Z and Priyanka and Nick. They should be in jail too, right? Their love is unacceptable as well, isn\u2019t it? Basically, it\u2019s not your business. Those two care less about what you think. To them you\u2019re all strangers, nobodies even.Chaeyeon deserved first place. She was clearly one of the most, if not the most talented trainee out of all of them. If Korea wasn\u2019t so focused on visuals and more on talent than she would have won. We can\u2019t change the ranking though, but we all know who deserved the win.Lisa is one of the best dancers of the third generation. Once again, I feel like just because she\u2019s from Blackpink there\u2019s a certain bias against her. Lisa is a really good dancer and has proved that time and time again.BTS didn\u2019t pave the way. There were a lot of idols before them that had a huge impact on kpop and started the Hallyu wave that really solidified kpop as a genre and popularised it in South Korea. Just because they blew up internationally, and helped it become a global genre doesn\u2019t mean that they paved the way.BTS blew up because of good luck. I\u2019m not saying that the boys aren\u2019t talented, but there were a lot of reasons that they blew up the way they did. The main reason was that there was no leading boy group in the West. This meant that inevitably there was going to be a new big boy group that blew up. BTS did with DNA, which led to them winning the Top Social Artist Award at the 2017 BBMAs. This then led to them becoming even more popular as people wondered who these boys were and here we are today. If there was a popular boy group like One Direction in the West, I\u2019m 100% certain that BTS wouldn\u2019t have blown up the way they did.Itzy\u2019s I\u2019m not like other girls concept is annoying and unoriginal. After a while, people are going to get tired of it. Their songs are also really weird in a way? Like, the way Icy starts gives me a bit of a headache and it\u2019s quite odd. Hopefully they\u2019ll have a different concept for their next comeback.I don\u2019t like IU. I understand that she\u2019s really talented and has great visuals, but I don\u2019t really like any of her songs except Good Day and Blueming. I really don\u2019t like her music and don\u2019t get the hype around her, I guess.You don\u2019t get to decide what a true fan is: that\u2019s arrogant and just confusing in a way. Like, who are you to suddenly declare yourself an expert on what a fan truly is? By definition, a fan is: a person who has a strong interest in or admiration for a particular person or thing. Saesangs are fans. Solo stans are fans. Toxic fans are still fans. Just because you don\u2019t like them, doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t a fan. I don\u2019t know when the kpop community suddenly decided to ignore this definition and make up their own, but that\u2019s not it. All of the three mentioned above are fans, they\u2019re just fans that the kpop community doesn\u2019t like.BTS can only trust ARMY financially. That\u2019s literally the only thing that they can trust ARMY to do. When Jungkook was with his friend and was just trying to hang out like a normal person, ARMY overreacted. I felt so bad for Jungkook and his friend. I felt most for the manager though. Poor guy. They can\u2019t even go on vacation for more than a month. A month, without the ARMY forcing them to stop their break abruptly. The Jimin in Paris incident is just \u2026 unspeakable. I\u2019m speechless. Honestly, it\u2019s just disappointing.Bighit probably pays Dispatch to keep them quiet. It\u2019s understandable though. Knowing how unpredictable ARMY can be, it\u2019s better that they don\u2019t have any dating scandals. If they do, I\u2019ll be quite scared for their partner. ARMY can be really mean when they want to be. God forbid they actually do.Seventeen has the best choreographies and one of the best discographies in kpop. Nothing more to say, really.Don\u2019t Wanna Cry deserved better.Shine deserved better. I\u2019m still a tad upset that the song didn\u2019t win any awards.Pentagon deserve their first win. They\u2019ve got 12 albums and still don\u2019t have a single win. Hopefully it\u2019ll be this year. They have some bops.The only attractive BTS members are Jungkook, Taehyung and Jin.Everglow didn\u2019t deserve their first win. Dreamcatcher did. They only won because Dreamcatcher were robbed and that\u2019s the tea.I liked Flower Shower. It was refreshing to see Hyuna do a more innocent concept. I really liked the beat drop. I feel like everyone expected her to do another sexy concept and were disappointed when she didn\u2019t.Everglow won\u2019t blow up. Their songs use too much EDM and they aren\u2019t really memorable. I get that using EDM may be their concept, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t think that South Korea is ready for that. Also, for me the beat drops are kind of predictable- it\u2019s always another hardcore EDM one each time.People aren\u2019t grateful for the visuals bringing attention to the group, which makes no sense at all. You should be grateful that the group is getting attention. Even if people support the group because of the visual then it\u2019s fine; it benefits the group in the long run. I bet you the group would rather get attention because of the visual than no attention at all.I don\u2019t get why people hate the idea of visuals. Without EXID\u2019s Hani, they would probably be unknown. Same for Eunwoo and Astro. That\u2019s the whole point of visuals, to bring attention to the group because they\u2019re beautiful/handsome. What do you want visuals to do, ruin their face? It\u2019s not their fault that they\u2019re extremely attractive.New kpop fans should be aware of 2nd and 1st generation groups and idols and how they helped to pave the way and had a huge impact on kpop. I\u2019m not saying that they have to support them, but they should be aware of how they helped shape the industry and make it what it was today. There\u2019s a reason that your faves look up to them.Idols are meant to be better than you. That\u2019s the whole point, they\u2019re meant to be more attractive than you, to sing/rap way better than you and to dance better than you. That\u2019s the whole point and concept of idols; you\u2019re meant to look up to them because of this.TVXQ\u2019s Mirotic is one of the best kpop songs. The lyrics are really interesting and creative and tell a pretty cool story. The dance is great and the vocals are just, *chef\u2019s kiss*.Most idols personalities are fake and that\u2019s ok. Being an idol is a job to them. If the idols told fans what they were really like and what they really do, they probably wouldn\u2019t be popular and the kpop industry wouldn\u2019t be as big as it was today.Idols hook up all the time. Fans who continue to deny this amuse me. Idols are working in an industry with extremely hot people with amazing bodies, it\u2019s natural that they would hook up with each other. All they have to do is hide it from the fans and media and they\u2019re fine. I\u2019m not saying that all idols hook up with each other, but some idols who do hook up with fellow idols.Dating bans don\u2019t exist. Companies do this to satisfy the fans. If some fans knew that their favourites were dating from debut, they would go ballistic. Idols are taught how to hide this from the media. How do you think Hyuna and E\u2019Dawn weren\u2019t exposed after so many years until they decided to reveal it?I don\u2019t get why Taehyung vaping is a big deal. ARMYs say that they\u2019ll support them no matter what, but when a member does something they don\u2019t agree with, suddenly they\u2019re a \u201cbad example\u201d and \u201ccancelled\u201d. Taehyung is a grown man and has the right to vape if he wants to. This is why they don\u2019t share anything with you, because you guys can\u2019t just say \u201cOk, they have the right to live their life how they want to.\u201d and support them. BTS don\u2019t actually need ARMYs approval. They need their money.It\u2019s ok to stop stanning a group because of the fandom. When you become a fan of a group, a fandom plays a big role in your experience and interactions with the group. If the fandom is toxic and it\u2019s making you uncomfortable or affecting you negatively, then you have every right to stop supporting the group. For some people, they associate the group with their negative experience and that\u2019s fine. Ultimately, a fandom does represent a group.2019 MAMA was disrespectful to every artist that attended, even artists that weren\u2019t invited, except for BTS. Stray Kids and many other idols weren\u2019t invited despite having a good year. Chungha performed really early on and had a short stage. That just infuriates me because a) she performed before the rookies, despite being one of South Korea\u2019s most successful soloists and b) she got a really short stage. They did GOT7 so dirty that I cannot. I literally cannot. Confiscating their table was a bit extreme. Also, where were the female idols/artists? 40 minutes just for BTS. That\u2019s not really their fault, but it\u2019s still extremely unfair to the other artists. It was basically the popularity awards, so obviously BTS ended up winning everything. They are also the only artists that got a full fancam, which is just f*cking b*llshit at this point. If they had allowed cameras we could have gotten full fancams for every artist, but we didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t record reactions for the best part of many idols performances: Twice\u2019s dance break and Seventeen\u2019s Fear Intro when Wonwoo ate a flower. They were incomplete and that\u2019s the worst part. Should\u2019ve just called it the 2019 BTS Awards.SM are superior. They produce the best idols out of the Big 3. All of their groups are labelled flops at debut, but end up being the most successful and having a big impact on kpop, EXO being a great example.JYP isn\u2019t as great as everyone think it is. They overwork their artists (Twice being the best example) and neglect their boy groups, GOT7 being the biggest example. JYP himself also limits GOT7\u2019s potential by not letting Jaebum release songs because he doesn\u2019t like it. Some of them are bops, though?, so I don\u2019t understand his logic. I get that he\u2019s passionate about music and that he founded the company, but by rejecting songs he doesn\u2019t like he\u2019s really stopping them from becoming more successful, especially in Korea.I don\u2019t like Loona. There\u2019s just too many members and way too many things to remember. Their concept is a big turn off for me.Boy groups > Girl groups. I listen to a lot of music by girl groups, but I don\u2019t really feel the need to stan them. They don\u2019t appeal to me as much as boy groups do.Everyone talks about the over sexualiation of females in the industry, but not males. To me, it just shows how hypocritical kpop fans are. You don\u2019t mind when male idols show off their abs, or arms and wear really tight and revealing outfits. You also don\u2019t hesitate to comment extremely inappropriate things about them, but God forbid anyone does that to a female idol/s. \u201cDisgusting! \u201cyou cry. \u201cYou\u2019re over sexualising them!\u201d you say angrily. For these kpop fans, it\u2019s a dOuBle StAnDard. It\u2019S UnfAir. YoU sHouLdN\u2019t seXuAliSe tHem tHiS mUch.Not every kpop song has to be about societal issues. I think that it\u2019s ok to have songs which are carefree and aren\u2019t serious. Blackpink are a good example. Their songs are bops and don\u2019t discuss any serious issues, which is fine. Seventeen\u2019s Thanks is dedicated to their Carats and is quite a deep song. NCT 127\u2019s Highway to Heaven Eng. Version is all about sex and is still still super catchy. Majority of BTS\u2019s songs are about societal issues such as loving yourself. Not all of them are bops, but some of them are, which is fine. Music isn\u2019t limited to one type of song or one type of concept, so kpop shouldn\u2019t be as well.Songs about societal issues are becoming boring and the concept is overused. The idea of loving yourself has definitely become cliche in kpop. Songs focusing on society are ok, but now here are so many songs about loving yourself and how society is unfair and it\u2019s honestly become boring. Write songs about other things.I didn\u2019t like Map of the Soul: Persona at all. It felt almost messy to me in a way? I understand that it was for ARMY, but it just wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. Seventeen\u2019s Thanks seems like a better way to do it for me. Hopefully their next comeback will be better.Boy With Luv didn\u2019t feel like a collab with Halsey. She just sang the chorus and that\u2019s it. Isn\u2019t a collab meant to be more than that? know that a lot of people said that she got more lines in the album, but if I don\u2019t like the title track then why should I listen to the album?I want BTS to have a really dark and unpredictable comeback, like Mamamoo\u2019s Hip. Hip exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations, because no one expected it to be what it was. I want BTS\u2019s comeback to more hip hop focused and the title track to be more focused on rap than vocals,IOI could have been the nation\u2019s girl group. They were done dirty. I find it unfair that when Izone debuted that they had a contract for 2 years and 6 months, but IOI only got one for a year. I know that they had a contract and were a temporary group, but they were so popular whilst active and could have been extremely successful if they didn\u2019t disband. Like, Twice level popular.Idols should tell their fans off when they\u2019re out of line. A great example of this is EXO. By doing this it makes the fandom think about what they\u2019ve done and almost always results in the fans improving their behaviour, because as fans we never want to disappoint our idols. I know that if Seventeen ever told Carats off that I\u2019d die on the inside. Maybe I\u2019d cry. Anway, by doing this it teaches the fandom what not to do and also shows others that kpop fans can mature and aren\u2019t always whiny and regret their actions.Love Scenario is Ikon\u2019s best song.Blackpink\u2019s Jennie has great stage presence. All of the girls have really good stage presence, but for some reason Jennie stand outs more than the other members for me.Really Really was Winner\u2019s peak.Survival shows are becoming boring and Produce 101 Season 2 was the peak for them. I understand that companies and TV networks wanted to reproduce the success of the Produce series, but now the groups that come out of them aren\u2019t really that appealing any the idea has become overused to the point of being lazy for me.There\u2019s always social context behind the way Korean fans are acting the way they are. Sometimes international fans don\u2019t understand the way Koreans fans act the way they do in certain situations, such as the Produce 101 scandal. The Korean fans were mad and acted like that because of the college admission scandals and the elite abusing their power being exposed in South Korea. International fans wouldn\u2019t know that.SuperM aren\u2019t a flop. I feel like they\u2019ll achieve great things in the future and that their next comeback will be extremely successful. Just because you don\u2019t like them, doesn\u2019t make them a flop.International ARMYs took it too far with the DKDKTV controversy. Look, you have the right to disagree with opinions. That\u2019s perfectly fine. What is not ok is sending death threats and harassing someone because you disagree with their views. The hate that they received was absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. The I-ARMYs that did this made you guys look like psychopaths to everyone else and made the fandom look a lot worse. Practically every comment on that video was just the ARMY hating on them. It was horrible. By reacting like this, you make the ARMY look even worse than it already is and give the fandom a bad name. There\u2019s a reason you guys are disliked and labelled as the most toxic fandom. Hopefully next time something like this happens, you guys react in mature way whilst also getting your point across.K.WILL\u2019s Please Don\u2019t is the greatest kpop MV of all time. Literally nothing can top this for me, nothing. If you haven\u2019t watched the MV you should definitely check it out!Kim Jaejoong is the original visual. I may be gay, but I\u2019m not blind. Jaejoong was and 14 years later still is one of the hottest men in the kpop industry. Without him, I\u2019m not sure that the concept of having a visual would even exist. I\u2019m a bit surprised that a lot of the newer kpop fans don\u2019t know about him. He\u2019s also a really sweet person. So, in conclusion check out Kim Jaejoong!Not everyone has to stan the groups from smaller/unknown companies. I\u2019ve noticed that lately it\u2019s kind of become a trend for people to act like they\u2019re superior to kpop fans who stan groups from the Big 3 or well known companies. I honestly do not understand that mentality and the fans who keep bragging about it and trying to shove the groups down everyone\u2019s throats are annoying. Look, it\u2019s okay to love and promote your faves, but acting like you\u2019re better than others and constantly bragging about them and then shaming people who don\u2019t stan them is annoying. There\u2019s probably a reason that people don\u2019t stan that group and it\u2019s very unlikely that they\u2019re going to blow up and revolutionise kpop like some of you guys claim they will. Stop shoving your faves down other people\u2019s throats.Stan Twitter is a shit hole. Nothing more to say about this.Saying that the toxic fans are only a minority and trying to dismiss them is actually so rude and selfish. Let's take the ARMY as an example, as they\u2019re one of the biggest and unfortunately, problematic fandoms in kpop. Whenever someone says that ARMYs are toxic and calls you guys out for your behaviour, majority of you guys like to reply by saying that they\u2019re only a minority and not everyone's like that. This also applies to practically every other fanbase, but you guys are the biggest fandom and are the representation of kpop to those who only know about BTS and their fanbase. Let\u2019s say that only 10% or even 5% of you guys are toxic, because like you say it\u2019s only the minority. There are about 136.4 million of you guys out there [1], so that means the toxic 10% and 5% of you guys respectively are 13,640,000 and 6,820,000 people. That\u2019s a hell of a lot of people and I\u2019m willing to bet that there are a lot more ARMYs than this. Whether you like it or not, that\u2019s a huge number of people for a minority. Dismissing these people and their harmful and hurtful actions highlights a huge problem with the ARMY and kpop stans: the inability to accept responsibility. Even if it\u2019s not you or majority of the ARMY that are being mean or just toxic in general, you guys need to accept responsibility for what they\u2019ve done. You can\u2019t just dismiss it because you think that they\u2019re not a \u201ctrue\u201d fan like a lot, and I mean a lot of you like to claim. You know what that shows others? That you guys can\u2019t accept responsibility and like to shift the blame around, because you know they they\u2019re wrong, but you don\u2019t want the fandom to look bad so obviously the only solution is to just not accept responsibility or apologise for their actions. That\u2019s selfish and immature.Another example for a girl group would be LOONA fans, who are known for posting stuff like this:   You know what that is? Disgusting. Disrespectful. Just wrong. And a lot of LOONA fans don\u2019t like to accept responsibility for this: \u201cthe community likes to say these people are trolls trying to insult the group but troll or not Loona would be sickened to know that this is going on.\u201d[2] I\u2019m sorry, but not every single one of these people are trolls. Some of them are LOONA fans and claiming that they\u2019re not true fans and using that logic to not accept responsibility and shift the blame to them is disgusting. It\u2019s more disappointing than disgusting really. I understand that it\u2019s not all of you, but shifting the blame just makes it look worse in my opinion. Just apologise for it. You guys don\u2019t get to decide what a \u201ctrue fan\u201d is. Even if they\u2019re toxic and do stuff like this, they\u2019re still a fan, because: By definition, a fan is: a person who has a strong interest in or admiration for a particular person or thing.You guys can\u2019t just pick and mix what type of fans you guys like. That\u2019s not how it works. Footnotes[1] How many fans does BTS have?[2] K-pop stan on twitter uses mass shooting to promote music group.",

            "answer_text": "These probably aren\u2019t all unpopular opinions but I still feel like saying them. This will probably be a really long post (and it will most likely not even cover half of my opinions), so sorry in advance. Hope you read and see why I\u2019ve said each thing. BlackPink are over hyped:BlackPink had one comeback this year, and it wasn\u2019t as good as it should have been. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they are a descent group, but their fans massively over hype them.Square Up was disappointing:The vocals were lackluster and the songs did not seem well produced. Considering that they had a year to work on their new album, it should have been a lot better. On top of that, Forever young is a song that they have been working on since pre-debut yet it wasn\u2019t great.It should have been a full studio album that was produced a lot better. Sure their songs come off as good at first, but after a couple of listens you realize that the\u2019re actually pretty average.BlackPink have year long breaks. They should train during them.When BlackPink came back, I at least expected that the would have improved their vocals, technique and stability, but they had actually gotten worse. Rose\u2019s technique will destroy her voice eventually and when they\u2019re performing her vocals are unstable. Jisoo is the most stable member and with better technique, she would be even better.YG needs to train they\u2019re idols well:YG artists all have great potential but his idol groups have bad technique. His vocalists have unsafe techniques that could eventually destroy their voices.Jennie stans need to admit her faults:I understand that she has motion sickness, but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to put no effort into group performances. It makes no sense that she performs her solo at their concert perfectly without motion sickness, yet when the next group performance comes, she has it again. Medicine for motion sickness does not wear off that quickly. All the other girls perform their songs with full effort, yet Jennie mixes sequences in their dance and even her parts at times. She\u2019s stopped trying which is rude and disrespectful to the fans who paid to watch them perform in concert.This actually applies to all KPop stans, it\u2019s just that Jennie\u2019s scandal right now has made it obvious that some of her stans need to mature and learn that she has her faults.BlackPink are not an insanely unique and original group:BlackPink are 2NE1 2.0. They didn\u2019t invent the girl crush concept and by no means do they perform it the best.Some BTS songs have lost their touch:A common recurring theme that I have found in DNA, Fake Love and Idol is that they have lost their unique touch. From debut to the Wings/YNWA era, BTS\u2019 songs all had this personal touch from each member that made it uniquely a BTS song but recently their songs have lost it. It seems that they did the songs exactly how the producers had the guide done and in all honesty, it\u2019s a bit disappointing. I understand that the producers have a plan for how the song should sound, but they need to allow them to add a unique touch to the songs their given.Their tracks were also not produced as well as the could be. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they were decent, but they actually could have been a lot better. I feel like they were too rushed, they should have sat on the songs a bit longer so that they were the best they could be as their kinda\u2019 average.Euphoria shouldn\u2019t of had the track it did:I feel like due to the message that Euphoria had, I felt like the track was too much. Due to the extreme drop and the heavy dub-step back track, I felt like the message and vocals were overpowered. I personally think that Euphoria should of had backtrack that used real instruments.BigHit should release an acoustic version of it. Piano, acoustic guitar, maybe even a cajon (box drumb) and Jungkook\u2019s vocals. The lyrics of the song deserve a raw, stripped back version in which we can fully hear the emotion in Jungkook\u2019s voice and the lyrics. It would help bring more meaning to the song.EDIT: I\u2019m kinda tempted to pull Jungkook\u2019s vocals off the track and just make an acoustic version myself. I\u2019ll see how I feel over these next 2 months of holiday. Who knows?TWICE aren\u2019t untalented:TWICE are actually a talented group, and they deserve the recognition they have gotten. They\u2019re all good vocalist and the real problem is that the songs that they have been given are all at the top of their range. JYP needs to give them a song that better fits their range and allow Momo and Sana to sing with their real voices.TWICE members can all dance. They may not have the hardest choreo, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad dancers. The songs they were given, and the trend that JYP is trying to make them work with wouldn\u2019t suit a high intensity dance.TWICE did their concerts all fully live as they wanted to give their fans the best experience possible. Their vocals during the concert were all stable and they have been performing stably in their live stages recently. Their live vocals are better than quite a few groups.Give them a chance. Don\u2019t just jump on the bandwagon of hate because others are on it.Dahyun isn\u2019t the weak link in TWICE:Dahyun is the TWICE member who I feel has a lot of potential if not the most. She wasn\u2019t accepted by all of the Big 3 companies for no reason.Dahyun is actually very pretty. Her visuals perfectly fit Korean standards and I actually don\u2019t understand when people say she\u2019s ugly. Yes, her visuals may not be for everyone, but that doesn\u2019t make her ugly.If JYP gave her the right training, she could easily become one of the best vocalist in TWICE. She has one of the most versatile vocal tones in TWICE. Her tone (don\u2019t go getting annoyed at me ARMY), is very similar to BTS Jungkook\u2019s. I\u2019m not saying that she should become main vocal, I\u2019m simply saying that their vocal tones are similar. They both have naturally soft, kinda breathy tones that sound good in ballad songs yet when they add power, they are very strong and suit upbeat songs. With the right training, she could be a great vocalist.JYP needs to train her rap more. She has a good tone, but her flow is slightly off. She needs to be taught how to properly ride the rhythm when rapping so that she can rap to her full potential. It\u2019s not always off, only sometimes.She is not the weakest dancer in TWICE. She was scouted by JYP due to her solo dance performance at her school festival. Dahyun is one of the strongest dancers in the group and always performs well. Her stage presence is definitely one of, if not the strongest in the group and her dancing is always smooth and pleasing to the eye. As well as that, she is the only other member other than Momo that has participated in choreography (I\u2019m pretty sure that none of the other members have).She, if she gets the training, could do well in a solo. I\u2019m not saying leave the group, I\u2019m just saying that she could do a solo project in the future. Or the girls\u2019 could one day release an album with solo tracks on it. Her voice would fit various concepts.I don\u2019t think that she would actually do poorly at a sexy or girl crush concept if she practiced the dance. She is just someone who isn\u2019t sure at how to freestyle these things and so when asked, she automatically goes for her fun dance as she doesn\u2019t know how to do these things on the spot. Remember their \u2018Now\u2019 cover. She could also do well at acting in the future if she ever wanted to.TWICE don\u2019t need to change their concept:Not every group needs to change and try out new concepts. The girls will probably try out a new one soon as they are 3. Rather than change their concept, the girls can just mature it. They stick with their unique colorpop genre yet change their music up.Red Velvet\u2019s concept changing seems kinda\u2019 lostI understand that they have both their Red and Velvet sides, but their Red side seems kinda\u2019 \u2018spastic\u2019. It kinda\u2019 seems like SM either doesn\u2019t care enough or Red Velvet can\u2019t decide. Some of their songs aren\u2019t well produced. RBB did not seem ready for release and the Halloween concept M/V at the end of November made no sense. They should have waited a while longer and improved the song.They need to finally decide what type of music they want to release and produce it well. I think that when they finally do this, they\u2019ll finally start to have a clearer image and know what works for them.Some 3rd Generation Idols lack stage presence, especially compared to 2nd gen idolsIdols in the 3rd Gen should work on their stage presence. Red Velvet, although a talented group, have underwhelming lives due to having practically no stage presence.Groups also need to work on having a strong stage presence, no matter the circumstances. I understand if their down due to loss of someone close, but if its just because they can\u2019t be bothered, than that\u2019s a different story. TWICE and BTS are heavily overworked and have the busiest schedules, yet they are still the two groups in the 3rd gen of idols who have some of the best consistent stage presence.(G)I-dle isn\u2019t as amazing as fans sayAlthough decent, their title tracks lack a sense of umph. Their choruses are weak, and they could do better. Fans only hype them because of their concept and different sounding songs.Soyeon, although good, is not the best female idol rapper of 3rd gen idols.They shouldn\u2019t have covered Fake Love. Their cover of Fake Love ended up fully disclosing their weaknesses as a group. They lack the vocal and rap skills needed to perform it well. As well as that, it is a song that heavily needs a strong stage presence if performed live, which the lack. Soojin is no doubt their best performer live, yet she was barely in the center.KPop fans need to stop viewing idols as objectsI understand that due to how companies promote idols, they can come off that way, but they are not objects. They should be able to freely date and live their lives without worrying what their fans will think. You don\u2019t own them and it is not their job to stay single so that they please you. They\u2019re human beings, they are allowed to fall in love and date.KPop companies need to change their approach of how they promote groupsCompanies are the reason that fans are like this. I understand that it is to draw more people in, but it causes some fans to have an unhealthy obsession with idols and causes them to do dangerous and unhealthy things.Some fans need to calm their farm:I understand that you stan a group, but there\u2019s no need to go onto other groups video and \u2018stan xxx\u2019 or \u2018xxx is better than them\u2019. It\u2019s unnecessary and immature.If you dislike fanwars so much, why do you say rude things about other groups. The first step to stopping these fanwars is to stop doing things to start them and understanding the difference between criticism and hate.Don\u2019t criticize a group if you don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re criticizing them on. I criticize groups on vocals, rap, lyrics, dance, production and more because I learn music where we get vocal training, producing and song writing as well as delivery, reading and composing music, differing between live vocals and lip syncing. I also have learnt multiple instruments. When I was younger I trained in ballet, contemporary and hip-hop. I\u2019ve performed on stage and have learnt how to properly perform on stage and have stage presence. Unless you actually know what you\u2019re talking about, don\u2019t go on about it. If you do, don\u2019t be rude about it.NCTSM should allow NCT to become popular in America naturally, not force it. Their interviews are awkward and most Americans haven\u2019t heard of them.SM should either allow Dream to remain as they are or create a sub-unit with only those members. Their music has matured since their debut and if they get new younger members, they may have to change back to their old concept.EXO \u2018Tempo\u2019 is an underwhelming copy of NCT \u2018Regular\u2019Same chord progression, similar buildup, same style. They\u2019re practically the same song. When I first heard Tempo I thought I was listening to a vocal version of Regular.EDIT: So after seeing people say that these two songs aren\u2019t similar I went back and listened to them again, but the are still really similar to me. Yes, I was a bit harsh but it was mainly because I thought that EXO could have had a better song. I understand that while Regular is focused on rap Tempo shows off EXO\u2019s vocals but that wasn\u2019t what I was talking about. I was talking about the backtracks and how they are very similar. Both songs have a different tempo (pun unintended) but the style, chord progressions and beats used in both tracks were very similar. The producer on both tracks is the same so it\u2019s understandable but even then, I wish that they had made some other changes to the backtrack. I like both songs, but the back tracks get to me.Unless a group is absolutely talent less (which should be impossible in KPop) they\u2019re not overratedKPop idols train so hard to debut and the deserve recognition for that. No group is overrated, they\u2019re simply over hyped. Nobody has the right to call a KPop group overrated, they work hard and any recognition they get, they deserve.Edit: Over hype= A group or idol who\u2019s fans give them too much hype and credit for what the do. They deserve recognition but fans need to tone it down.Overrated= A group who doesn\u2019t deserve the recognition or hype that they get. Too much attention for doing barely anything. Their fans and them rate themselves to high.Similar but different.Fans should stan a group because they like their music or their personalitiesI understand if you stan a group because of those reasons, but if you only stan them because they\u2019re good looking/pretty or you want to date or marry them, then are you actually a fan? Stan groups and artist for real reasons.Shipping can be immature and cause groups to be uncomfortableShipping between members in groups can make them uncomfortable and awkward with each other. It\u2019s okay if you like them as friends, but if you do it sexually, you can make the members awkward around each other. BTS said in their early years that they use to get fan letters with fan fics, as well as go online and see videos and post saying that members like each other and are sexually active with each other. RM commented how these things made them feel uncomfortable with one another and that he wishes that fans would tone it down.Shipping idols who have barely any to no interactions makes no sense. I understand that you like them, but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean they\u2019re dating. If you want to ship, that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t go and do some extreme reach and make edits just to support our ship.Don\u2019t hate on other peoples ships if they\u2019re not causing any harm. Just because they don\u2019t have the same ship as you, doesn\u2019t mean you can hate on them. I have seen people who ship idols with literally no interactions hate on fans who ship idols that actually have some interactions and could be real.In all honesty, it\u2019s better if your shipping is only going as far as friendship, after that it\u2019s a bit of a stretch. Imagine how awkward it could be for your idol if they\u2019re in a relationship and you guys are shipping them with all these other people. Imagine how even more awkward it\u2019d be if your shipping them with a member from their significant others group that isn\u2019t them. These things can hurt people.Idols don\u2019t have to tell us everything and they don\u2019tIt\u2019s their private lives. If they don\u2019t want to tell us, there\u2019s a reason.I always see people say that because their idol said \u201cI don\u2019t want to date a celebrity\u201d that they won\u2019t and then get hurt if they do. Have you ever thought that maybe they so that so that fans don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re in a relationship? Just saying\u2026Also, if you have noticed that it\u2019s possible that an idol is dating, rather than tell everyone, protect them. They\u2019ll be very grateful when they reveal their relationship. I\u2019ve seen some fans do this and I honestly love it.Dispatch needs to get a lifeRather than following around Korean celebrities all the time and revealing that they\u2019re in a relationship when they don\u2019t want anyone to know, why can\u2019t they just talk about what idols are doing that they want the public to know. Dispatch has ruined so many relationships due to revealing them early on.They should do more reports like the one they did about Inkigayo. First time I think that I actually thanked Dispatch.Why do people in the industry reveal relationships before they get comfortableI understand if you have permission to talk about it and give hints as long as you don\u2019t give names, but why do they feel the need to go and tell Dispatch that two idols are dating. A perfect example of this is Momoland Daisy and iKON YunhyeongBe like iKONics guysI\u2019m sure that there are other fandoms like this, but iKONics are literally the only fandom who I see tell the idols they like to date. It\u2019s actually funny sometimes. Like iKONics are a really cool fandom. Minus the few \u2018fans\u2019 who like to go try and have a go at other groups and fandomsAnd that is all for this installment of my unpopular KPop opinions. If you like it than thank you, if you don\u2019t, well oh well. There\u2019s a reason they\u2019re opinions.

            "answer_text": "okay, here\u2019s some unpopular opinions i\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019ve never seen before: 1.) i don\u2019t think that wendy\u2019s \u201clet it shine\u201d part had any place in happiness  yeah, this is probably one of the more controversial ones. don\u2019t get me wrong, i love this part of the song, but i just don\u2019t think that it fit the overall vibe of the song. it sounded like it was meant for a different song, and it just didn\u2019t really work for me. 2.) i don\u2019t think that itzy\u2019s concept is getting old  okay, everyone who says that their concept is getting repetitive are actually getting on my nerves a little. they\u2019ve only had three comebacks with the same concept, and a lot of people started saying that they icy and dalla dalla were too similar because they had the same concept was started to really annoy me. they had only had two comebacks at that time with the same general vibe and their concept is much more unique than a lot of k-pop groups right now. i don\u2019t see as many people coming for groups like blackpink and everglow who do the girl crush concept a lot. 3.) i liked boy with luv  i know that a lot of people didn\u2019t like this comeback because they didn\u2019t like their concept compared to wings era and such, but i actually liked this song?? i don\u2019t know, i felt like the dreamy concept was a good look for them. plus, it\u2019s nice to see them branching out and trying new concepts. 4.) autotune needs to stop  autotune in k-pop has gotten really excessive recently, and i don\u2019t understand why. i like hearing natural voices rather than robots. sometimes it gets to the point where i can\u2019t understand which idol is singing because they sound so manipulated. i get it if you\u2019re using a little bit to make the song sound better, but it gets annoying at times. 5.) fourth gen performances are weak  companies are so obsessed with projecting this image of perfection on their idols, and i don\u2019t think that they realize the reason why we start stanning groups is when we see their true personalities because they\u2019re a lot more likable than the fake one\u2019s they\u2019re forcing them to have. i like watching idols having fun on stage, or getting the crowd involved, or changing up the choreography a bit, but there\u2019s no variation on different stages. most idols just do the same choreography and lip sync, and there\u2019s really no excuse for that. why do you train all those years just to pretend to sing a song? 6.) twice didn\u2019t need to change their concept  don\u2019t get me wrong, i love their new elegant concept, but i miss their cute concept too. i know that their new concept is going to bring in a lot of new fans which is good for the group, but i think that cute concepts are dying out which makes me really sad. like, i\u2019m glad for this new era of k-pop, but it\u2019s focused a lot more on mature/girl crush concepts and i wish we could have more innocent/cute concepts as well. 7.) somi should have left jyp  \u2026she just shouldn\u2019t have joined the black label. somi has so much potential, but she\u2019s basically faded out of the spotlight ever since she joined yg. we all knew that if somi had debuted in itzy, she would have overshadowed the group by so much and that just wouldn\u2019t have been a good move on jyp\u2019s part. i would have loved to see her join a different company and debut as a soloist there. 8.) yg\u2019s new girl group is fake  i\u2019m pretty sure that their new girl group is just a ploy, or yg\u2019s actually that dumb and really wants to ruin his career. if you think about it, this is an excellent marketing strategy (even if it\u2019s not so nice). blinks will be so upset that this next comeback might be blackpink\u2019s last that they\u2019ll rush to buy everything that they can to support their group, which will only help yg in the end. they won\u2019t actually debut their new girl group, but they\u2019ll pretend that it\u2019s in the works to get blackpink more sales. 9.) blackpink are losing credibility  i\u2019m pretty sure that they\u2019re not just losing fans but also their reputation as well. since they don\u2019t appear on variety shows or attend awards shows anymore, they\u2019re losing a sense of connection with their fans. yg doesn\u2019t seem to understand that giving them a \u201ctoo good for normal k-pop stuff\u201d look isn\u2019t helping them at all, or that their fans would rather have idols than models. 10.) mnet aren\u2019t going to lose reputation (even after the produce scandal)  it pains me to write this, but mnet aren\u2019t going to lose anything. the produce scandal was big, but iz*one is still going strong even though x1 had to disband. plus, they run a bunch of awards shows and they\u2019re still a big company. even though it\u2019s hard to process, a lot of things in k-pop are rigged, and everyone gets over it. mnet is too big and too important of a company, really, so they\u2019re not going to lose much. 11.) k-pop isn\u2019t that deep  i swear, a lot of fans find the most obscure references in the smallest things. like, some random idol from a big group could be wearing a white shirt and then some fans would do way too much research and be like, \u201comg this is actually a reference to (insert clip from obscure vlive here) where they said so-and-so and this proves that (insert obscure reference from their childhood) which ties in to (insert mv teaser) where they-\u201d it\u2019s like - no. it\u2019s not that deep. 12.) nct has too many members  okay, so i\u2019m not an nct stan so i really don\u2019t get much say in this, but if i ever wanted to get into the group there\u2019s no way i would ever learn all of their names. why can\u2019t sm just debut them as separate groups and not sub-units that sometimes do collabs? they\u2019re basically separate groups anyways. 13.) the concept of biases is dumb  not just the concept, but biases as a whole. why do we have to be so obsessed with people\u2019s biases? why can\u2019t we just love the group as a whole and not be so focused on \u201cwho\u2019s your bias? my bias is ___.\u201d i don\u2019t like how a lot of conversations in k-pop are just \u201cmy bias is ____, but my bias wrecker is ____.\u201d i don\u2019t like how a lot of conversations about groups are about who everyone\u2019s bias is. like, can\u2019t we just support the group as a whole and not focus on who are favorite members are? they\u2019re not objects to be fawned over, you know. 14.) there need to be more co-ed groups  i don\u2019t know why every agency only debuts boy and girl groups (with the exception of a few like kard.) i would love to see more co-ed groups because i hate how everything is so divided by boy-and-girl in k-pop right now. i think that a co-ed group from a major company would be a huge turning point for fourth gen k-pop and make it really stand out. 15.) jyp is not the best company  i don\u2019t know how many times people have said that they are, but they\u2019re really not the best company. they overworked twice and stray kids and they probably have a bunch of scandals too, they\u2019re just better at handling them. i know that they\u2019re better than a lot of terrible companies like pledis and sm, but there is no \u201cbest\u201d company because they all have flaws. EDIT: i\u2019m back with some more unpopular opinions! 16.) itzy\u2019s lia is not a bad dancer  i hate how this is an unpopular opinion, but it needs to be said. lia isn\u2019t a bad dancer, in fact i think that she\u2019s actually a pretty good idol dancer. it\u2019s just that, compared to the rest of itzy, she isn\u2019t as talented at dance. i personally think that all the hate around lia\u2019s \u201clazy dancing\u201d is just an excuse to hate on itzy. she\u2019s not a bad dancer, it\u2019s just that everyone else in itzy is much better. 17.) mia\u2019s favoritism isn\u2019t that bad  i know that she gets all the lines and that it\u2019s really not fair for the rest of the members, but k-pop honestly isn\u2019t about fair line distribution. it\u2019s about making the best song possible, and to be honest, the rest of the vocal line in everglow aren\u2019t very good. i mean no hate towards any of the other members, but mia is their only strong vocalist and it makes sense why she gets the most lines. with that being said, i would have loved if her dance break in dun dun was a group dance break instead. for everyone saying that e:u should have gotten the dance break: i think that mia pulls it off better than e:u would have. (EDIT: when i said that the rest of the vocal line in everglow weren\u2019t very good, i didn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re bad or untalented. i wasn\u2019t trying to discredit any of the hard work they have put in to debut and i\u2019m not here to bash their singing skills. the reasoning behind this is, the vocal line in everglow (other than mia) are not stable while singing live and since everglow seems to have pretty intense choreography, it makes sense why their only stable vocalist gets the most lines.) 18.) beat drops are lazy  of course, there are a few good beat drops (for example: mamamoo\u2019s starry night). but most of the time, beat drops instead of choruses just make me feel like the producer/composer was too lazy to write an actual chorus. not only does it rob the group of a proper chorus, but it just sounds rushed or sloppy in general. 19.) red velvet shouldn\u2019t always have a group chorus  most, if not all of red velvet\u2019s choruses are all of the group singing in harmony, which is great and i usually love it, but it doesn\u2019t have to be all the time. i would love if they featured specific members on the chorus to showcase them more, instead of having the whole group sing. i think that it would really give members like wendy and seulgi a chance to shine. 20.) clc shouldn\u2019t have debuted  it pains me to say it, but it\u2019s true. clc basically only exist to make money for cube\u2019s other groups. they have been denied so many basic k-pop group necessities: a lightstick, a solo concert, and so many other things, and it\u2019s ridiculous considering that they\u2019ve been around since 2015. half of their comeback mvs look cheap, especially devil. it\u2019s disappointing that cube is throwing away their careers, especially since they have so much potential. i love clc with all my heart, but sometimes i wish that they had never debuted so that they would all be spared the pain of being neglected by cube. how do they get cheap mvs like devil but (g)i-dle get such beautiful and expensive mvs like hann? it\u2019s just not fair to their fans, or the idols themselves. 21.) there are no \u201csuperior\u201d stans  by that i mean that people who stan multiple \u201cunderrated\u201d groups aren\u2019t any more entitled to being called \u201cbetter fans\u201d than people who only stan one group. just because you\u2019re a multi-stan doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re a better k-pop stan than someone who only stans bts. i really hate it when someone says \u201ci really like bts!\u201d and then someone who thinks that they\u2019re a \u201csuperior\u201d stan says, \u201cwell i like astro and pentagon, you\u2019re so basic, why do you even like k-pop you obviously know nothing about it.\u201d that\u2019s actually so rude and it\u2019s part of the reason why non-stans give k-pop a bad image. you\u2019re not superior in any way, you\u2019re just giving yourself a bad rep. 22.) visual shouldn\u2019t be an official position  *i have a lot to say about visuals. sorry if this is controversial, but that\u2019s why you\u2019re reading this answer, right?* i know that south korea is really focused on beauty standards, but i don\u2019t like how visual is a position. it\u2019s my personal belief that tzuyu of twice probably wouldn\u2019t be as popular if she wasn\u2019t the visual. i mean no hate towards tzuyu, and i absolutely respect her 100% since i know how much she has struggled to become a member of twice. but the reason why she was added into twice was because of her visuals, and i think that is a source of a lot of hate from antis. if tzuyu was added because of her skills and not her visuals, i think it would mean a lot more. i know for a fact that i wouldn\u2019t want to be the visual in a k-pop group. i think that visuals often get more focus on their face than their talents, which is wrong on so many levels. idols train for so many years, only to get focused on for their looks? it\u2019s just a backwards system. it\u2019s unfair to single out one specific member for being the \u201cprettiest\u201d one. i personally don\u2019t agree with the concept of visuals. there\u2019s always going to be a \u201cprettiest\u201d member, but do we have to put so much focus on it? the fact that we focus on visuals and not talent in k-pop disgusts me. it\u2019s a sad truth that a lot of people have trouble accepting, but it\u2019s true. chaeryeong of itzy is so talented and she\u2019s an amazing dancer, but k-netz hate on her for her visuals that don\u2019t fit the korean beauty standards. can we not just appreciate her talent? chaeryeong is so skilled at dancing and that should be what we focus on about her, not her visuals. 23.) i think that everglow buys views  this sounds really mean at first, but hear me out. this is purely speculation and i\u2019m just theorizing. obviously, it wouldn\u2019t be everglow who buys views, but their company. adios mv hit 100 million views, but their concerts don\u2019t even sell half of their seats. the facts just don\u2019t match up. this is really sad since i love everglow and they have so much potential, but buying views is not the way to go. it will only end up disappointing their fans. plus, if everglow don\u2019t know that their company is buying views, it\u2019s not fair to them. (EDIT: i no longer agree with this opinion. i now realize that there is absolutely a difference between casual listening/streaming and actually attending a concert in person. however, i have seen multiple seating charts for everglow\u2019s non-us tours and they didn\u2019t sell half of their seats. perhaps this is because they have more western fans? i\u2019m not really sure. it\u2019s hurtful to see comments that say i am making up information about everglow because \u201ci hate them,\u201d when this is absolutely not true. while i may not be a stan, i love their music and i think they have so much potential. the reason why i\u2019m not deleting this opinion is because i believe in addressing your mistakes rather than trying to cover them up.) 24.) dating bans are okay  (as long as they end at some point.) look, i understand if a group just debuted and you need the members to focus more on their careers than dating. i think that a few years with a dating ban is totally fine if they are a rookie group and need to focus on the group, not their love lives. but saying that groups have dating bans because of toxic fans is absolute bs. toxic fans cannot rule idols\u2019 lives, that just gives them the power that they want to have. idols such as bts and blackpink shouldn\u2019t have dating bans because of toxic fans, they should have dating bans because they need to focus on their careers. 25.) produce groups should stay around for longer  i don\u2019t know how unpopular this is, but i really think that only two and a half years of promoting is a bad move on mnet\u2019s part. i understand that companies want their idols back sooner so they can start making a profit with them, but i really think that it\u2019s a missed opportunity for mnet because produce groups are extremely popular and make good profit. 26.) twice needs a break  i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because they\u2019re overworked, but i feel like a lot of their fancy stages (especially at mbc) have been lacking stage presence. i love twice\u2019s energy on stage, but with their fancy comeback i feel like they were just tired. it\u2019s upsetting to watch, frankly, because it really looks like they\u2019re going to collapse on stage while performing. jyp needs to give them a proper break, and not just for a month. having constant comebacks like twice does is strenuous at best. it\u2019s definitely a good thing that mina sat out promotions for feel special, hopefully she\u2019s doing a lot better now! 27.) random english words don\u2019t make a song better  okay, this has been a trend for a while and i feel like no one notices it, but it\u2019s actually so annoying. take any random k-pop song (i\u2019m going to use \u201con\u201d for this example, no hate towards bts) and you\u2019re guaranteed to find random english words thrown into the lyrics. i don\u2019t mean english lyrics, i mean stuff like jimin\u2019s opening line in on: \u201c\ud55c \ubc1c\uc790\uad6d \ub5bc\uba74 \ud55c \ubc1c\uc790\uad6d \ucee4\uc9c0\ub294 shadow.\u201d like what is the word shadow even doing there? does it need to be in english? it honestly makes me mad when i hear random english words thrown in there. i personally think that it\u2019s because companies want international fans to be able to sort-of sing their songs, but it\u2019s getting old. 28.) why were bts at the grammy\u2019s  i don\u2019t mean last year (though that was questionable too), but this year specifically. why did they perform with lil nas x? why were they literally like backing vocals? i really didn\u2019t understand their performance. i feel like it was supposed to mean something monumental but it just fell flat for me. i wish that they had showcased their dancing skills instead of sitting on chairs. i wish that the rap line actually got a chance to rap. i wish that the vocal line didn\u2019t feel like backing vocals. i feel like this performance left a lot to be desired. 29.) solar\u2019s pole dancing was awkward  i\u2019m not here to judge her for her choices, because that\u2019s not really my place, but her choosing to pole dance instead of singing was an interesting choice, to say the least. honestly, the whole performance felt kind of stiff, and i kept expecting something bad to happen since it was live. i thought a lot of it was either walking around the pole/climbing up the pole and it just felt awkward. 30.) zimzalabim was my favorite title track from the reve festival  i know that a lot of people had mixed feeling about this song, but i loved it from the first listen. psycho was obviously really good, umpah umpah just wasn\u2019t released at the right time, but zimzalabim had a really infectious energy i felt and for some reason i really loved the chorus?? like i agree, psycho is some of red velvet\u2019s best work and it\u2019s such a great song, but i\u2019ve always gravitated towards zimzalabim more. i don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because of the negative association i have with psycho because of wendy\u2019s injury, or if it\u2019s because i think zimzalabim was just the girls having fun. EDIT: i\u2019m having way too much fun with adding unpopular opinions. someone stop me please- 31.) bighit shouldn\u2019t join the big three  this is just my opinion don\u2019t attack me. i know that bighit ranked above jyp but i really don\u2019t want bighit to join the big three. jyp has a big variety of groups which i think is important to be a part of the big three. bighit has two boy groups and one disbanded girl group i think, and i just don\u2019t believe that they have enough variety to be considered a part of the big three. jyp has multiple popular and successful groups including twice, stray kids, itzy, and got7, while bighit has one mega-successful group and one that\u2019s not as successful, but still pretty successful as well. 32.) ethnicities are not a concept  i\u2019m looking at you, (g)i-dle. i don\u2019t care if they want to set their comeback in an exotic place, but their entire concept shouldn\u2019t revolve around an ethnicity. i think that when soyeon said their concept would be \u201cethnic hip\u201d on queendom it was mistranslated, but i do agree that their performance of fire was a bit problematic. i know how talented (g)i-dle are, but i don\u2019t think they should rely on different cultures for a concept. i like how they\u2019re branching out with uh-oh and oh my god! 33.) ros\u00e9\u2019s vocal technique is unhealthy  look, i just don\u2019t understand why yg pushes a \u201cunique\u201d voice over one that doesn\u2019t destroy your vocal chords. i think that ros\u00e9 could be a very talented singer and she has a lot of potential, but not with this fake, cutesy voice that yg is pushing on her. i actually find it difficult to listen to ros\u00e9\u2019s parts in blackpink\u2019s songs. i hope that yg will hire an actual vocal coach so ros\u00e9 can learn proper vocal technique! 34.) bts hold their mics wrong  i mean, i\u2019m not here to bash them, but this actually really annoying once you notice it. mics have a handle for a reason, so that you don\u2019t hold the actual microphone part and muffle your voice. and yet, bts hold the actual microphone part of the microphones despite the handle being right there in front of them. i don\u2019t know if this is an unpopular opinion or just a fact, but i find it triggering. 35.) blinks claiming that yg doesn\u2019t allow blackpink to write songs seems like a poor excuse  i saw this one on a subreddit but i think it\u2019s really insightful so let me just share it with you guys! \u201ca lot of blinks like to put that argument that the reason blackpink doesn\u2019t write songs is because yg doesn\u2019t allow them to. to me personally this seems like a poor excuse to make up for the fact that they don\u2019t write songs. it is completely okay if the girls can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to write because not every idol is compelled to. but the blinks trying to make them look like gdragon/rm/suga level lyricists that have been oppressed by yg makes me lol. here are a couple of reasons why I think their argument stands invalid. 1. they are in yg: yg is home of artist that write their own songs. everyone in the company be it under yge or tbl is a songwriter. even somi who has just debuted last year has been credited on both birthday and outta my mind. other than that bigbang, 2ne1, ikon, winner, akmu or many other artists all write their own songs. so it makes no sense that blackpink would be stopped given that the company has a legacy of allowing artistic freedom with respect to lyrics. 2. why would yg stop them if they are good lyricists? if they can pen beautiful songs and amazing raps, why would yg stop them? wouldn\u2019t he save a lot of money on hiring lyricists? the girls would get a positive response for being \u2018artists\u2019 and that would mean more fan support. and that would generate a lot more money. and yg loves money!? 3. some fans argue they helped write stay and jennie helped with solo. sure they could have given creative input but that doesn\u2019t equal to actually writing the lyrics. being a lyricist would also require you to register a copyright for your work. and a whole ton of legal work too if you want to earn royalties. now if yg doesn\u2019t give the girls their credit, it could lead to a legal mess for him. since it would basically amount to plagiarism. and I am sure with the amount of cases they have in their name, they wouldn\u2019t want more. no idols are compelled to write music and that is okay. doesn\u2019t make them less idols compared to others. but to purposely bring an argument to mask the fact that girls aren\u2019t very competent lyricists is also not okay. in the past jennie has indeed mentioned that she wrote a lot of songs and had a diary of it. but that doesn\u2019t mean all of it is worthy of becoming actual songs. given that the industry relies heavily on charts and audience perception rather than artistic expression, it makes sense if yg stopped them. maybe its time blinks accept that they don\u2019t want to write/can\u2019t write and move on.\u201d 36.) i think that wannabe is itzy\u2019s best title track  look, i loved dalla dalla and i think it was especially strong for a debut song. icy was a bit noisy and some of it just felt a bit rushed and slapped together, so it wasn\u2019t my favorite but i still listened to it anyways. but wannabe? wannabe was what i was looking for in itzy. i loved the message more than dalla dalla (which was about being different) and icy (which was about not listening to your haters), since the message was about not wanting to be somebody else and wanting to just be yourself. the message of this song really struck a chord with me and it doesn\u2019t hurt that the song itself is excellent too. i think that wannabe is some of itzy\u2019s best work. 37.) i don\u2019t like when popular western artists collab with k-pop idols  i mean, the songs are fine, but most of them are just doing it to get more listeners. i don\u2019t like how a lot of idols are pushed to the side and forced to sing backing vocals instead, since it\u2019s supposed to be a collab. i just wish that idols would get more fair treatment during collabs with popular western artists. i\u2019ve never really understood why bts push collaborations on their title tracks, especially since they\u2019re unnecessary and sometimes result in hate for the other artists. i think that ever since halsey was featured on boy with luv she\u2019s received a lot more hate from jealous \u201cstans.\u201d this sort of behavior is absolutely not okay, which brings me to my next point\u2026 38.) shipping is disrespectful  i have seen so many answers where people say \u201coh it\u2019s not disrespectful to ship idols as long as you don\u2019t take it too far,\u201d to which i say that is absolutely not true. shipping real people should not be a thing. just because your favorite idols looked at each other for more than two seconds does not mean that you are allowed to ship them. just because your favorite idols are best friends does not mean that you are allowed to ship them. i have seen so many people excuse this sort of behavior because \u201cthey\u2019re not doing anything harmful,\u201d but i\u2019m not here for it. shipping is absolutely disrespectful and can be damaging to idols\u2019 relationships. idols are real people, not some fictional characters you can fantasize about. they have lives and they probably have relationships too, and just because k-pop is over-sexualized does not mean you are entitled to ship them. 39.) likey dance break was better than like ooh-ahh  i know that everyone loves the like ooh-ahh dance break literally so much, but i\u2019ve always liked the likey dance break more. i agree that the like ooh-ahh dance break had better music, but i liked the choreography for the likey dance break more. momo was amazing during both dance breaks but i think she was better at the likey dance break, which makes sense since like ooh-ahh was twice\u2019s debut song. 40.) rookie doesn\u2019t deserve the hate  everyone, even reveluvs, really seemed to hate this comeback and i\u2019ve never understood why. i get that the chorus gets annoying if you listen to the song more than twice in a row, but don\u2019t even try to tell me that you don\u2019t hum \u201crookie rookie, my super rookie rookie\u201d for days after listening to it. rookie is so underrated and it doesn\u2019t deserve the amount of hate that it gets. 41.) \u201cfancy for soty\u201d is annoying  everyone knew that boy with luv was going to win soty since k-pop awards are rigged, but no one would shut up about fancy for soty. it honestly got really annoying to the point that i stopped listening to fancy, even though it\u2019s an amazing song. i love fancy with all my heart but you guys wouldn\u2019t stop talking about fancy for soty and i just knew it wasn\u2019t going to happen. boy with luv was much more popular internationally and probably sold a lot more than fancy, so fancy obviously wasn\u2019t going to win. should fancy have won soty? no comment. but you guys didn\u2019t have to shove it in anyone\u2019s faces so hard. it\u2019s like \u201cstan loona\u201d but less problematic. also can we talk about the music video like why? 42.) babying idols is not okay  this is yet another opinion i have that others have claimed is okay, when it\u2019s really not. i think a lot of people claim that since companies make idols act cute and aegyo, it\u2019s alright to baby them. i don\u2019t think that babying idols to an extreme extent is okay, like calling them babies or saying that they can\u2019t fend for themselves or calling them innocent, naive, etc. newsflash: they\u2019re grown-ups, and that\u2019s probably not their real personalities. it\u2019s fine to call idols cute, but it\u2019s not fine to think of them as children, babies, etc. these aren\u2019t kids you\u2019re talking about, they\u2019re adults and they probably don\u2019t like being seen as kids all the time. 43.) i love weird stage names  everyone hates on idols who have weird stage names, but i love them. i think that stage names are fun and unique and they\u2019re a lot more interesting than using your given name. this is just my opinion, but i personally love rap monster and s.coups as stage names since they\u2019re unique and fun. 44.) i don\u2019t think oli london even likes bts  have you ever seen that one clip where he says that jungkook is the leader of the group? he honestly doesn\u2019t know anything about bts, i think he\u2019s just using their name to fuel his desire for plastic surgery. oli london looks nothing like jimin, if he really wanted to look like jimin then he wouldn\u2019t look like he does now. i really think he just wants to get lots of plastic surgery done and get famous off of it, so he picked bts to help him reach stardom. everyone who thinks that oli london is a saesang might be right, but i really don\u2019t think he even knows anything about k-pop. i don\u2019t even think that he wants to be korean. 45.) k-pop groups don\u2019t have to learn english  a lot of solo stans have hated on jisoo for not speaking fluent english before, but that\u2019s honestly ridiculous. i get that blackpink promote in the western market as well, but dua lipa has collabed with blackpink and hwasa and i\u2019m pretty sure she didn\u2019t learn korean for that. i don\u2019t think that a lot of k-pop stans even learn korean to talk to their faves, so why should they learn english just to talk to you? just because the group you stan has a lot of international fans doesn\u2019t mean that they have to learn english for you guys. i think a lot of people forget that these are korean groups based in korea, not in america. jisoo is not required to learn english, the same as you are not required to learn korean to be a k-pop stan. EDIT: i\u2019m back 46.) sakura should have won first on p48  i\u2019m not trying to discredit wonyoung in any way because i know how hard she struggled to achieve her win on produce 48, but now that we know the voting was rigged i\u2019m pretty sure that sakura should have won. sakura beat wonyoung in fancam views and she has a much larger fanbase as well. in almost all bias voting sakura has won first, but in every other season of produce the first place winner has been the most-biased. this isn\u2019t fair to sakura or wonyoung if sakura\u2019s win was taken away from her. 47.) red velvet\u2019s debut should have been pushed back  red velvet debuted right in the middle of one of sm\u2019s scandals, which i think was meant to distract the public from their scandal. smart marketing strategy, but there are two problems with it. one was that yeri was still too young to debut. since yeri was added into red velvet late, this has been the source of a lot of hate from k-netz. there\u2019s actually a lot of evidence that suggests that yeri was supposed to debut with red velvet, but since their debut was rushed she couldn\u2019t. another reason is that red velvet\u2019s debut felt rushed. happiness mv looked sloppy and the bridge felt out of place. i mean, they were wearing cheerleading outfits in the jungle. it just felt sloppy. i like the song but the whole debut just felt rushed to take the public\u2019s eye off of sm\u2019s scandal. i think that if red velvet debuted later (with yeri) it just would have been a lot better. 48.) i don\u2019t think that momoland plagiarized hip  i\u2019m not going to say anything about the bboom bboom/mi mi mi controversy because i think it\u2019s not really my place to say if they plagiarized their song. but i really don\u2019t agree with everyone saying that momoland plagiarized hip because they didn\u2019t. the songs sampled the same saxophone track, but just like momoland doesn\u2019t own the saxophone track they used, neither does mamamoo. and honestly, can you even listen to thumbs up and tell me that it sounds exactly the same as hip? because it doesn\u2019t. the two songs are different. there\u2019s no need to blow it out of proportion. 49.) the double standard in k-pop is real  i\u2019m going to use a different argument to prove my point here, as i think comparing jennie to literally any male idol ever is overused at this point. remember park bom\u2019s drug scandal? that happened almost six years ago and k-netz still won\u2019t let her forget it. she appeared on queendom last year which is definitely a step forward, but for years after that scandal she could barely show her face in public. and need i remind you that all park bom was doing was taking amphetamine, which is illegal in south korea but not in the us where she was prescribed? all that she had done was contact her us doctor to send her the meds because south korea\u2019s treatment wasn\u2019t working. meanwhile kim hyung joon admittedly hit his girlfriend but fans were quick to defend him, saying \u201cit was one time\u201d or \u201che\u2019s changed, get over it.\u201d the double standard in k-pop is real, so don\u2019t even pretend like it isn\u2019t. 50.) blackpink aren\u2019t the next 2ne1  i know that yg himself said that he didn\u2019t try to make any difference between the two groups (other than that blackpink was \u201cprettier,\u201d which is extremely rude but also extremely yg), but i personally find it rude that a lot of people call blackpink the \u201cnext 2ne1.\u201d this is so rude to blackpink to openly call them a rip-off of 2ne1, especially since i don\u2019t think it\u2019s true at all. a lot of people have tried to draw \u201cparallels\u201d between the two groups, but i think it\u2019s ridiculous and funny because these parallels aren\u2019t true at all. jennie = cl (the badass leader) jennie might have a badass stage presence, but while cl is badass on and off the stage, jennie acts much cuter in real life. besides, blackpink doesn\u2019t have an official leader. another argument is that they are both favored by yg, which is true, but that\u2019s not their defining characteristic. i don\u2019t think these two are similar at all. jisoo = dara (the 4d visual) while jisoo and dara might have 4d personalities, their personalities are also very different. if you\u2019ve ever watched a clip of dara and jisoo in your lives then you\u2019ll know that their sense of humor is very different. and while both dara and jisoo are visuals, i don\u2019t see a lot of people saying that yuna is a rip-off of tzuyu. ros\u00e9 = bom (the unique voice) although ros\u00e9 and bom may both have unique voices and are the main vocals of their groups, i genuinely don\u2019t think that ros\u00e9 and bom are anything alike. they have very different personalities and their vocal color is different as well. lisa = minzy (the dance machine maknae) i don\u2019t even have to be a dance expert to say that lisa and minzy\u2019s style of dance is very different. lisa has a more hip-hop style while minzy looks more fluid and flexible on stage. besides, their rap style is very different so you can\u2019t even compare their rapping either. i know that this description is long, but it really does make me mad when people call blackpink the \u201cnext 2ne1.\u201d just because both groups have the same amount of members and a girl crush concept does not mean that they are copies of each other. 2ne1 has a fun, vibrant, in-your-face vibe while blackpink seem more effortlessly cool and elegant. they\u2019re two different groups, and some people just need to accept it. 51.) gahyeon should be the lead rapper  i think that sua is the lead rapper in dreamcatcher but i honestly like gahyeon\u2019s rapping more. sua seems to sing more as well and i think her voice is more suited to vocals. gahyeon has rapped in some of their more recent songs and i really like her tone. i don\u2019t know a lot about rapping but i think gahyeon deserves the lead rapper position. 52.) like ooh-ahh wasn\u2019t the best  a lot of once\u2019s love this song to death but to be honest, other than the dance break this song wasn\u2019t that good. twice\u2019s vocals weren\u2019t very strong at the time and some of the sound effects weren\u2019t that great. momo\u2019s dance break carried this song and without it, i don\u2019t think it would be as popular. i know that a lot of once\u2019s love this song because it\u2019s twice\u2019s debut song, but it\u2019s not one of their best songs. for a debut song, it\u2019s good, but it\u2019s not as good as some people claim. also, the music video was very random and not in a good way. 53.) red flavor would have been one of rv\u2019s best songs if not for that sound effect  if you\u2019ve ever listened to red flavor you know exactly what i\u2019m talking about. that god-awful sound effect (i don\u2019t even know what if was, but it was just awful) completely ruined the whole song for me. it\u2019s so annoying because i love red flavor but i can\u2019t stand the sound effect. red flavor is such a good song and i would consider it one of rv\u2019s best summer songs if not for that sound effect. 54.) the maknae line in bts overshadows the hyung line  i really wish that they didn\u2019t, but a lot of armys talk about jimin, v, and jungkook way more than they talk about rm, jin, suga, and j-hope. i don\u2019t have a problem if some members are more popular than others, but when it comes to bts it really bothers me because a lot of people totally ignore the hyung line in favor of the maknae line. it\u2019s fine if some members are slightly more popular, but to this extent it\u2019s a little bit rude. 55.) guessing idol\u2019s sexualities is weird  i can\u2019t tell you how many times i\u2019ve seen fandoms claim wild things about idol\u2019s sexualities. it\u2019s like, i hate to break it to you, but not every idol in every group is going to be a member of the lgbtq+ community and that\u2019s okay. naturally some idols will be a member of the lgbtq+ community but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to make wild claims and speculations about their sexualities because that\u2019s really not any of your business. speculating about idol\u2019s sexualities is disrespectful and makes you look ignorant. 56.) power up is red velvet\u2019s prettiest mv  i know a lot of people would put psycho or peek a boo up there but power up is their prettiest music video by far. a lot of red velvet\u2019s summer songs have awful music videos so i didn\u2019t have high hopes for this one, but it was so pretty. from the colors to the styling to the scenes, everything was just beautiful. 57.) really bad boy and bad boy aren\u2019t the same  everyone attacked red velvet for releasing really bad boy because it was a \u201ccopy\u201d of bad boy, but honestly i don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. apart from the similar titles, these songs have very different vibes and i honestly don\u2019t think they\u2019re comparable. i\u2019m not saying which is better (since that\u2019s overused) but i don\u2019t think they sound the same. 58.) excessive hair-dying needs to stop  a lot of people have been saying that idols look better with natural hair colors, and i agree for the most part. i do think that a lot of idols look amazing with dyed hair, but i dislike the trend of neon hair dye since i think that\u2019s become a much-hated stereotype of k-pop. i don\u2019t mind softer or more subtle colors, but bright blue and pink look cheap and limit the amount of outfits an idol can wear (which is inconvenient because they are expected to wear different outfits for every stage). 59.) yuna\u2019s bangs aren\u2019t bad  honestly, i don\u2019t mind her bangs and i do think that yuna would look nice with bangs, except that her hair color detracts from it all. i think if her bangs were a little bit thinner and they went with a lighter color for her hair (like in itzy) she would look amazing with bangs. 60.) idols don\u2019t have to be talented  i mean, of course they have to be a little bit skilled, since they are in a music group, but i don\u2019t really think that k-pop is about the music anymore. of course, it wouldn\u2019t be k-pop without the music, but a lot of fans are drawn in because of their personalities and not their music. i\u2019m not speaking for everyone, but i do think that this is the case. idols don\u2019t have to be talented to debut as long as they have an interesting personality or beautiful visual. (EDIT: talent and skill are different things. i would argue that most, if not all idols are skilled, but having a talent for dance/rap/singing is very different. i would say that all idols deserve to have debuted, but they aren\u2019t all necessarily talented.) . . . ~momoko!!

            "answer_text": "Here we go! 1. ATEEZ are one of the most promising rookie groups.  Don't know them? Listen to Wave, Hala Hala, Say My Name, Pirate King and many more songs. They're surprisingly really awesome. These years will be dominated by BIGHIT and JYP rookie groups (let's see what happens when SM and YG debut their rookie groups) but, Ateez sure as hell made a name for themselves. 2. Blackpink\u2026well Blackpink. They are on every other answer so\u2026.  Well they lost me. What can you expect from like six comebacks and less than 20 songs? I mean, Ateez and TXT are rookies and they still have more songs than Blackpink. I am still looking forward to their first album which is like months away. Also their badass thingy is becoming kind of boring now. And yes, YG did say they prefer quality over quantity but we all know better than to believe those liars. Besides, I don't think their songs are really that good. They're repetitive, have nonsense lyrics most of the time. Sure they're catchy as hell but that is not the point. Talent doesn't always guarantee you popularity. Blackpink is talented but so is every other group in Kpop. 3. GOT7 deserves better.  Their company is notorious for favoring girl groups. Heck, Twice and Itzy are really popular. More popular than GOT7 and Stray Kids. a) They deserve more self produced songs because JYP songs aren't doing any wonders for them. JYP boy groups are free to make their own songs (GOT7 to some extent, SKZ's 3RACHA makes every one of their songs) but their girl groups are not. However, twice did participated a bit in Feel Special. And it is evident that their girl groups make more money (look at itzy who got instant success with their debut) so it's obvious JYP favors the Girls. It hurt so bad when he said GOT7 was at the bottom of waiting list. b) They deserve better rap verses. God knows that GOT7 would blow up the world if they had rap verses of SKZ, or like Girls Girls Girls or something. I've noticed that the rap was nonexistent in Eclipse, You Calling My Name and Not by the moon. c) and of course better treatment, more exposure in TV shows, and boycotting MAMA. d) More International promotions, GOT7 has 3 foreign members for god sake. And our Jinyoung is also rapidly transforming from a Korean into an Englishman. Haha. So guess who is JYP's biggest shot at success abroad? GOT7. And secondly itzy, because of their badass concept. They could be the next blackpink. But better. TWICE aren't suited for promoting in US, GOT7 IS. Is that why they're changing twice's concept? Honestly, Fancy was okay but Feel Special and More and More seemed like they're missing something. Back to GOT7. They have Mark. Who is btw from LA. And BAMBAM who is treated like a king in Thailand. And of course, Jackson Wang. He's big in China. What does twice have? 6 Korean members and 3 Japanese members. They do well in Korea and Japan alike. 3. TXT and ITZY are successful because of BTS and TWICE.  \u201cBTS brother group \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0dI'm gonna stan them ajhvfhdksakavggrsj\u201d Big Hit ent. becoming Big Hit Labels proved Kpop is becoming Big4 now. BTS's popularity and Army played a very big role in making TXT so famous. Those boys are good at what they do. They're talented. With itzy, their Dalla Dalla became viral. Some accused them of copying Blackpink but that's meh. Because Chaeryeong was in Sixteen, Once know her, support her. Ryujin is famous for she is a nice dancer. And Yuna was once talked about because she looked like Lee Seyoung. Twice's huge fanbase accepted their little sisters pretty nicely and itzy also brought a lot of new fans for themselves. TXT and ITZY won Rookie Grand Slam within their first year. I think obviously them being from big companies, (also BIGHIT and JYP are friends) led them being side by side(MAMA arranged their performance closely, kept them together),which isn't a bad thing anyway. Coming from a big and rich company pays well. 4. I don't like BTS anymore.  They're overrated and overhyped. Really. BTS introduced me to kpop when I heard \u2018Waste it on me\u2019 in 2018. I was so crazy about them, I liked Blackpink too. Then I hated like everyone who said anything bad about them. I don't like them anymore. I didn't like MOTS 7. They're not gods, they're not the only group in kpop, and while they've achieved a lot of things in west and east, they did not pave the way. I don't like the autotune they use and people say they make their own music? A lot of people help them in making their own music. You say they make songs about society and mental issues etc. A lot of people do that too. Besides, music will still be music if it doesn't have society and blah blah. So what? They were supposed to be a hip hop group? That's okay. People worship them? That's okay. I don't. They're good. But not my favorite anymore. 5. SM should have promoted their idols better in the west.  SM Ent. doesn't promote their idols in the west. Maybe they couldn't anticipate BTS will become so big there. Ha! Even though EXO didn't promote, they nailed it. \u2018Don't Mess Up My Tempo \u2018 and \u2018Love Shot \u2018 continued their streaks for superhit songs. Had they promoted EXO and Red Velvet in the west, it would've been world domination. Actually their thinking has always been to promote in China. They made another group in 2016 named NCT that promotes in the west. 6. RED VELVET is the best girl group.  Yes. Better than any girl group. You must be aware of top three girl groups of Korea- Blackpink, Twice, Red Velvet. Why is Red Velvet better? Vocals \u2714\ufe0f Visuals\u2714\ufe0f Choreography \u2714\ufe0f They rap nicely too. Whatever is the standard in there because for me, my fav. female rapper is Mamamoo's Moonbyul. Red Velvet's songs are versatile, catchy and different than others. Trust me, I'm not being biased. They have such a wide range of concepts, and they nailed every single one of them. Let's just judge by music. Rookie, Dumb Dumb, Ice Cream Cake, Russian Roulette, Red Flavor, Umpah Umpah, Bad Boy, RBB, Zimzalabim and Psycho! While twice has been doing cute concepts since their debut - Like ooh aah, Cheer Up, Yes Or Yes, TT, Signal etc. They're changing concepts now though. Fancy was sexy. Feel Special was okay. And More and More was just weird to me. Okay, I'll add more later bye\u2026 Let's Love\ud83d\udc95 ",

            "answer_text": "My first ever unpopular Kpop opinion, I considered putting a trigger warning but yall get even more curious when that happens, so theres no point at ALL but either way im warning you I'm about to spill some hot tea \ud83c\udf75 This will be long btw. EVERY company has favorites whether it is 2 or 1 member, EVERY company.I\u2019m probably going to be cursed with every word in the book for this one but it\u2019s true every company does have a member they particularly push or favor among the group, is it fair ? not really, is it understandable? Yes definitely, some companies tend to be obvious with their favoritism like YG with their rappers and others are subtle like BigHit, and some take it to a whole new level of creating a group that consists of their favorites *Looking directly at you SM*, the point is fans need to accept that companies have favorites, you can bark all day but it isn't changing a thing. 2. I'm convinced Kpop fans aren't human, calling them aliens would put those cute little creatures to shame The horror I see in Twitter espically can't be humans doing, this isn't hate, this isn't jealousy this runs deep down that I can't even comprehend it anymore, this is psychos behavior, I dont mean to insult anyone but this isnt normal, what do they actually get from insulting groups all day or hating on that member and trying to destroy careers every day, whatever they are they need to get some time out and go breath some fresh air, this isn't healthy. 3. The Twice cant sing agenda needs to go. Listen you self claimed vocal coaches who knows absolutely nothing about singing, Twice can sing, Twice can make any song theirs, Twice are talented and if you think otherwise you need to keep that embarrassment to yourself, Momo isn't the best singer and she does need some training, but that doesn't mean you have to rub it in our faces and call her untalented, we get it Karen you're tastless move on. 4. Stability =/ bad vocalists I don't know who needs to hear this but just because a group isn't stable live (target BP and imma whoop your ass, my girls improved they be eating CDs) doesnt mean they're the worst singers to ever exist, if they are as some fans claim then who the hell does the recording, autotune or not they're still singing, it's still their voices what's not clicking, live singing isnt everything, yes its a part of a good vocalist and it shows their skills but its not all. 5. Lip-syncing in more than 5\u201310 performances isnt OK. Go ahead and throw me in the ocean, I'm one of those people who like to hear live and fresh vocals, and I just happen to dislike Lip-syncing extremely, but that doesnt mean I want EVERY performance live and perfect, idols have their bad days, some of them are really overworked and I dont expect them to be perfect, but lip-syncing on every performance isnt acceptable, its their job at the end of the day to sing, dance and rap, its the path they chose, im not paying to see my idols glamed up like dolls im paying to see them and enjoy a performance live, theres no excuse for idols to lip-sync more than 10 times its their job no one forced them. 6. I love Suga but the whole Jim Jones situation threw me off. All of us were excited when his second mixtape dropped and everything was perfect till we found out about the speech and what did BigHit do throw an apology like it doesnt matter and armys ate it up and buried black armys feeling underground, while Suga acted blind like this whole situation isnt his fault when we saw him with our own eyes working on the song and the entire mixtape, he didn't apologize and he didn't say anything about it casue he knows armys and his company will protect him, I'm not convinced with the apology and I can never forgive him for the trauma that he and armys caused that day, I speak as an African when I say this, the situation still hunts me to this day, if something like this happens again he's just gonna drop us like we dont matter, its really heartbreaking I can never forgive him for this, and it isn't about the song its about his behavior to the whole scandal, he chose to ignore everything and move on when some of us are still deeply triggered, im really disappointed with this i never expected him to ever do something like this, you can call me an anti for all I care, I'm a human before a fan, I'm African and im proud, even if I love him, I can never forgive Min Yoongi for this. 7. Armys don't feel like home or family anymore. I stanned BTS before their huge sucess (Just because I dont write about them on Qoura doesnt mean I'm a fake army, I'm more active on other apps more than Qoura) back then everything was actually hard, I won't deny it but even then the fandom was connected, they were fun, we used to defend BTS and go back to living in our own little universe that was made just for us and share our love for the group, it was way easier, no one would guilt trip anyone for not streaming, not everything was about achievements or awards, we didn't use to downgrade every group and call them flops just because they arent BTS, we used to voice our opinions without being called antis and fake armys we used to get along with many fandoms and we used to be more friendly, solo stans wasn't a thing back then, to be fair some of these people still exist but the majority isnt like this anymore, everything is for bragging rights these days and the amount of obsessed fans is frightening, the group may thrive but the fandom won't, the family that armys claim exist perished, its honestly heartbreaking. It wasnt the perfect little world, but I'd never trade it for any fandom. 8. BigHit give me bad vibes, I dont like the company at all. Its not about the JJ situation with Suga nor is it because Im a V stan, but this company seems quite shady to me, I can't explain my feelings in particular but there's something off and its crystal clear to me, they arent perfect we all know that but I can't shrug the feeling that there's a bomb thats about to drop anytime in the future, I really don't like the company or the CEO, they scream fishy to me. 9. Some of the things fans drag others for when they voice their opinion on a specific point about a certain group is originally created by the fandom. Mind yall I said some, cause there are many things idols get dragged for that people started out of no where, while my point is the things the fandom created on earlier days and they became a thing that stuck on a specific idol or a group, for example the \u201cRos\u00e9's voice is fake\u201d many people who believe Ros\u00e9's voice is fake have no idea how vocals work, Ros\u00e9's voice isn't fake, she simply has a wide range that allows her to sing in her higher register rather than her lower register because YG desires a unique voice and that's the way she was trained to sing, if you don't like it its up to you, but don't go spread the word like how blinks did in BPs debut era, and the effect it had on her is horrible, because blinks themselves spread this and other fandoms took it whether because they hate BP or they simply know nothing about vocals, Ros\u00e9 is established today as the \u201cweakest main vocal in kpop\u201d when she's very far from that, and who's fault is it, her own fandom bottom line, many things yall pop your veins about were created by your fandom, if you look back in your faves earlier days you'll find that im correct. 10. I don't particularly blame the people who think that Jennie's lazy scandal clarification is fake. Now before you throw your tomatoes and drag me to hell give me a chance, I personally belive it, i dont think Jennie would throw her career like that and her neck in the wild without a reason, but many people didn't believe it and I really can't blame them, listen yall the only times Jennie was actually Lazy was during her group's performances, but she suddenly became energetic during her solo stages, whether it was because she thought that her members will make up for it, or her popularity would save her -which actually did if it was any other idol they wouldn't see the light after that- either way she didn't perform fully, and i think there's something behind the scenes that we dont know about, starting with the article that popped out of no where 2 years AFTER the scandal, i dont know about yall but thats a huge red flag, the writer was probably paid by YG for all we know to silence the issue once and for all, it was very suspicious when it suddenly was clarafied and of course it was a good enough reason since we saw that Jennie was indeed injured many times and she stated that she has a frail body, either way I believe it, even if I think its suspicious the Jennie hate train needs to park once and for all. 11. Armys and blinks yall are long lost lovers who match perfectly for the love of God kiss already, i give my consent to your marriage too \ud83c\udf1a. Listen you useless mfs, both of your asses are the true definition of a karen, yall are both the worst fandoms in Kpop, probably the worst to ever exist, theres no need to waste your energy and write essays and attach proofs about how the other party is worse than yours and blablabla when yall were made for each other \ud83d\udc80 full offense intended, yall could just mind your own business and stop sticking your noses in each other's business and dont tell me who starts first kids, i know the LovvvvE you have for each other is immense but PDA isn't on the web, take that stick that shoved up your asses out of it and stop terrorizing us armyblinks every fcking day, and yall bitches on qoura can come and sue me, i said what i said, kiss and let us be and imma say it again with the mic on, yall are the worst fanodms to ever exist pack it up. I feel like I've been harsh so I'm gonna add damn yall. 12. NCTzens my boos \ud83e\udd70 yall are probably \ud83e\udd7a the dumbest\ud83d\udc9a and the most untrustworthy\ud83d\udc9a fandom to ever exist \u2620. I put some hearts and crap for your asses cause yall are better than the Karens above, but yall are dumber than anyone else, every month in Ncity is a new episode of dumber and the dumbest, sure you make up for it with your humor and your horny asses but that isn't saving NCT in the long run, yall belive anything that could be written about the boys, ive never seen a fandom who would throw their faves without blinking like yall do, even if the lovers above are toxic at the end they defend their faves, but yall would give them a free ticket to hell with a smile and a comment about how Hot they are, my baby Taeyong's allegations, the Yuta situation, Jungwoo last month, who knows what your asses will pull this month, yall at this point everyone could trash on your faves and you'll kiss them instead of slapping them, listen Hornyzens I beg yall please stop believing anything, at any time from any one, Taeyong has been sacrificed many times already, he's probably pure by now he's an angel at this point, stop believing everything about him and the rest of the members, for the sake of my sanity stop your mortification act every month. 13. Blinks who bring up the Coachella performance each time someone says Blackpink are lacking in stage presence are proving the exact point. Here goes problematic Talia again 3 days before the album and blinks might gang up on me any minute and end me before the big day but I\u2019ll say my thing, here\u2019s the fact bitter blinks, Blackpink DO lack in stage presence and y\u2019all need to start accepting that as soon as possible, Coachella performance was the ONLY performance that had the debut spark Blackpink had as rookies, and yes I said the only one go ahead and throw your knives, we all know things went downhill in 2018, and all of you need to stop denying that, their concerts are amazing way better than their inkigayo and music awards stages thats given but Coachella and debut are on a whole other level of energy, charisma and presence, it was totally amazing, and it did feel like they were a YG group for the first time in 2 years, I was hoping they\u2019d keep that energy during their world tour but yeah that didn\u2019t happen, from the many things Blackpink need to work on is their stage presence as a whole group and their consistency in it, Lisa and Ros\u00e9 are always energetic my girls deserve their rights hell Lisa traveled all the way from Rome to Japan and delivered an amazing performance even though she was clearly worn out, Jisoo also has an amazing energy going on but she\u2019s often shadowed by the other two, she was sick many times but she still gave it her all, Jennie however is the tough case, although is see her improvement since 2018 but I still don\u2019t see a consistency in it nor the rookie monster Jennie, she only lacks in consistency and I hope that improves now that their biggest cb is coming. 14. Taeyong will always be the center D E A L with it. I see people losing their minds every day over my boy being the center in NCT photo shoots and teasers but that\u2019s gonna keep happening and you can bark till eternity and it isn\u2019t going to stop, I mean come on Taeyong is the Leader (with Kun) and Centre of NCT as a whole that\u2019s why you\u2019ll always find him, Lucas, and Jaemin in the centre cause guess what honey they\u2019re the representative of the units and their official centers, and Taeyong will always be in the middle simply because aside from being a center he\u2019s the leader of the group and the one who does the speaking and starts the presenting (To the world we are NCT) every time for NCT and the members themselves acknowledge him as their leader, I\u2019m not undermining Kun\u2019s worth he\u2019s an amazing leader and he proved himself to be one but Taeyong will always be the 1st leader he himself said he has 22 children, let the man live in peace he\u2019s already losing his mind with his kids. 15. I\u2019m tired of people saying BTS needs to give others a chance . This one literally makes me lose my mind I mean what the fck do you want them to do Britney \ud83d\ude2d??? Stop making music??? Stop being successful??? What do you want them to do we\u2019re up for suggestions here and now, but heads up in the next few years they aren\u2019t going to stop making music, they aren\u2019t going to stop being successful, they aren\u2019t going to stop their revolution, so what do you want from them, call me a selfish egoistic army or whatever it is, but you\u2019re the one who decided to leave the entire industry and attack BTS simply because they are the BTS, nothing more, and you have to live with it, focus on your group and enjoy their music and success and you\u2019ll get the entertainment from the them, BTS aren\u2019t the circus y\u2019all want them to be. to be continued.

            "answer_text": "Big Hit Entertainment You are a K-pop fan if you only stan BTS, as long as you aren't a toxic ARMY.ARMYs are not the most toxic fans. Some people can be immature or rude, but who they are online doesn't reflect their full personality. Besides, the size of the fandom is so big that there are bound to be some fans like that. Other fandoms arguably have equally toxic fans.Hyung line members aren't underrated anymore, but new ARMYs should still appreciate them and not just the maknae line.The LY trilogy are better albums, as a whole than Young Forever, YNWA, HYYH and HYYH pt. 2, and WINGS, but the Young Forever, YNWA, HYYH and HYYH pt. 2, and WINGS albums' individual songs are better.DNA was not a flop in my opinion, but the fact that it was overhyped compared to other title tracks caused it to become unappealing to some fans.Fake Love and IDOL shouldn't have been the title tracks- I feel like other songs would have fit better as MVs but not as a visual aspect for them (other songs in the album would have been better but Fake Love and IDOL's concepts fit music videos better visually).I don't really like their first few albums because I'm not really into the hip-hop genre, but some individual songs were good.I don't watch the Japanese MVs, I'm not really into Japanese versions of songs in general.I didn't like V's visuals at first, probably because it was so different from the other members'.My first bias was Jungkook because I was a typical new ARMY, but I soon came to love hyung line more than the maknae line (sorry, but I feel like the hyung line's producing talents are going to take them farther than their rapping or vocal abilities).Big Hit was a problematic company before BTS, but I feel like BTS made people forget about that fact. Even during BTS' career, there are still some major scandals.The BTS Fake Love Jungkook x Charlie Puth stage was not a flop. Charlie Puth's intentions for doing the collab may have been misinterpreted, and there were definitely many technical issues, but it goes to show how broad BTS can expand their horizons.K-pop fans should stop hating on American artists as well as other idols. Artists work hard to keep their fans happy!Big Hit will not be a part of the Big 3 anytime soon. Due to SM, YG, and JYP Entertainment's historical impact on the K-Pop industry, they will continue to remain the Big 3 even though BTS earns more money alone than any one of the three companies, they simply don't have enough of a historical impact (compared to SM, JYP, and YG).If Big Hit does manage to become part of the Big 3, then they will replace YG Entertainment but only at least several years after 6ACES' debut.Speaking of TXT, their success will hinge on whether Big Hit is able to manage two groups at once (one of which is already unspeakably famous and the latter of which will gain most of their popularity from the success of the other group).YG Entertainment YG is the least deserving of the 3 Big 3 groups to earn that title. They don't train their idols well and push their idols to do some things that they aren't comfortable with.YG's new boy group will determine the overall success of the company after they debut.Bang Yedam is too good for YG. If he isn\u2019t the leader of TREASURE 13, I have no idea what YG is doing with its future.I don't really keep up with BLACKPINK, but if they were managed better by YG, I feel like they would be more successful (right now I feel like they are being ignored by YG).I feel like the fact that Jennie has been dating with Kai has something to do with the controversy of her being 'lazy'.As with the controversy, I feel like she is becoming less enthusiastic with choreo, but I don't think it's fully her fault, YG is playing a part in it.At first, I interpreted Jennie's 'SOLO' as her distancing herself from BP (\"I'm going solo\") and as justification for her attitude, and I feel like if that's the case, she shouldn't have done that.Blackpink doesn't deserve the high number of views or awards for their songs. I feel like the songs aren't really anything special and the MVs don't have any special meaning.I don't really like BP's members' attitudes. Jisoo is the most toned-down in my opinion, so I dislike her the least out of all the members. However, I feel like they are being forced to act a certain way and I don't really get it since it doesn't appeal to a lot of people (including yours truly) and doesn't benefit the members or their company.If BP disbands, it's for the better, unless YG steps their game up and actually focuses on them.Jennie and Kai dating is a way to attract people's attention toward Blackpink but not in the way that YG may have wanted.BIGBANG was and still is the highlight of YG's Entertainment's career.SM Entertainment SM has the best merch, music videos, and artistry out of the entire industry, but the way they treat some groups and members are just corrupted.(About the Kai and Jennie dating situation) I feel like their relationship isn't genuine and they don't go well together.NCT China line is my favorite line (coming from an ABC here).EXO's declining popularity is entirely SM's fault. They completely stopped promoting them a year or two ago and now their success is going downhill.The EXO-L fandom is much less toxic after the problematic fans left (possibly due to EXO's decrease in success or the fanwars between ARMY and EXO-Ls). It's gotten a lot better but some fanwars are inevitably going to happen.If EXO's rap line was as skilled as BTS (in my opinion, BTS' rap line is much better than EXO, please don't kill me) and their songs weren't all about one topic (mainly love), they would be way more successful.The three members that left (Luhan, Kris, and Tao) are justified in their reasons for leaving (which also goes to show how corrupted SM is [not that all the K-pop industry as a whole is corrupt]).JYP Entertainment JYP is the best company out of the Big 3, hands down. They treat their idols decently and also train them very well. Also very unproblematic compared to the other entertainment companiesStray Kids is going to become very popular in 2019 - they produce and write their own songs and lyrics, choreograph their own dances, and earned 5 ROTY awards (as of the time I am writing this), all before their 1st anniversary! Sadly but inevitably, they will get haters, but after BTS' major success, people are now scared to drag down rookie groups.Stray Kids are one of the most unproblematic groups there are.Stray Kids is not successful only because they are under one of the Big 3 companies. They have worked extremely hard to earn what they have right now.I disliked Bang Chan's visuals at first but now I want to kill myself for thinking such a thing.DAY6 is amazing. They were the first band I stanned and it gave me a completely new look on K-pop (*cough* \u2018Shoot Me\u2019 *cough* <- It's such a bop!!!!).TWICE is also a great group, but I like their more recent releases more than their previous ones. \u2018DTNA\u2019 was surprising to me since it wasn't a cute concept (like TWICE had been doing before) and \u2018The Best Thing I Ever Did\u2019 - absolutely amazing and refreshing! I only like select songs before \u2018DTNA\u2019, such as \u2018Like Ooh-Ahh\u2019. \u2018YES OR YES\u2019 didn't appeal to me and seemed like a weird combination of cute concept and girl crush concept. Also, I found the members smiling in the beginning of the video creepy and slightly weird.Other I like boy groups way more than girl groups because their concepts appeal more to me.Talking about concepts, 2NE1 did indeed create the 'girl crush' concept. Also, I don't like overly cute (bubblegum) concepts. I feel like the artists are straining their voice to make it sound more cutesy or girly, which I hate. The songs are overly catchy and infectious (not in a good way) but I can tolerate SOME cute concepts.Girl and boy group choreos can't be compared in terms of difficulty.Solo artists deserve more love!!!!BTS and SKZ need to rest!! They need it - we can go without one comeback, but imagine the toll it takes on your body to do all that!MOMOLAND will either become very popular or flop.(G)-IDLE is a pretty good group.N.Flying, The Rose, and DAY6 are the best bands.Stray Kids, The Boyz, and ATEEZ are the power rookie boy group trio of this generation.SHINee, EXO, and BIGBANG are the kings of K-pop as we know it today (sorry if I missed your fave, it's just my opinion).Wanna One deserves the hype that they get. \u2018Energetic\u2019 was a great debut song. Although their other songs weren\u2019t outstanding, they were solid and they ended their career amazingly with \u201cSpring Breeze\u2019.While we are on the topic of Wanna One, their disbandment was too premature, they could have gotten way farther if they had stayed together longer. Also - goodbye Wanna One T_T I loved you and love you still\u2026BOY STORY is an okay group, but I just don't feel comfortable stanning people who are younger than me. Also, your voice changes after you hit puberty, and they may need to adjust to using a whole new vocal technique (I\u2019m considering them as K-pop because they trained under JYP, even though they are Chinese).Monbebes, Carats, STAY, and AROHA are very nice fandoms to be in.K-pop fans are more likely to be more open-minded to other things and less judgemental than non-fans (according to observations made by yours truly).People who don't like K-pop because it's 'gay' or are too judgmental or closed-minded honestly don't make any sense (unfortunately I am surrounded by these people every day).On a brighter note, Amber and Jae (DAY6) are hands down my favorite Tweeters of all time - they have me dead on the floor laughing every damn time lmaoSo that's it! If I missed your fave, please don't kill me, I'm human too and things really get in the way of stanning every artist and group possible T_T You don't have to completely agree with me, but please respect my opinions. Anyways, I hope you liked my extensive K-pop opinions which weren't really 'unpopular', per se, but I needed to get them off my chest for a long time. I'll be back with more soon and hope you all enjoyed reading this! Hwaiting, Priscilla Ye Edit: I have changed some opinions (mostly about SM) as I have gotten into SM artists and groups a lot more.

            "answer_text": "Hello, so basically i had already done an answer similar to the same question, but the great Quora decided to collapse it after it hit 50K+ and oh boy that hurt because i spent hours doing it.  Okay let\u2019s just get started: 1. BTS didn\u2019t pave the way:Armies: Wow! Our BTS oppas paved the way internationally! They\u2019re the best! They\u2019re kings! They\u2019re the legends of Kpo- -Hold on, wait a minute, legends of K-pop? BTS? I am a huge fan of BTS, like huge, but did you guys forget 2NE1, BigBang, Super Junior, SNSD, TVXQ, BoA, RAIN, Lee Hyori and Wonder Girls? If these groups didn\u2019t pave the way through Asia, BTS would\u2019ve never been this big. These are the legends of K-pop But i guess the newbies forget/ don\u2019t know the real legends of K-pop. But still, BTS did play a huge role in the western market. And if you don\u2019t agree:  2. PSY is the solo legend of K-pop:Who paved the way internationally? Yup, PSY did. PSY is known in America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia. Who doesn\u2019t know Psy? Even my Grandparents do. Also, he is one of the best dancers of K-pop. This man is 42, isn\u2019t that fit, but his dancing skills are out of the world. Do you want to know another reason to why Psy is the solo legend of K-pop? Psy isn\u2019t just Gangnam style, he has been in the industry since 2001. Do you know how hard it was for him at the beginning? The managers of YG argued about his \u201cugly\u201d looks right in front of him. They didn\u2019t want to except him after seeing his face, but they didn\u2019t have a choice because they had already signed a contract. He had to cover/ hide his face at the beginning of his career because he didn\u2019t fit the beauty standards despite being a respected artist in South Korea. He was a well known artist there but fans never knew how he looked like. But look where he is now. This legend made us stan K-pop before we even knew it was K-pop, ugh the power he holds.  3. Lee SooMan was the best CEO in the industry:First of all a little message to the newbies, Don\u2019t send hate to Lee SooMan when your fave gets mistreated. He isn\u2019t the CEO anymore and left like 10 years ago (February 2010) after his wife found out+died because of cancer. Imagine how hurt he must\u2019ve been that he left the Empire he made with his sweat and tears for like 2 decades. So just leave him alone. Yes SM entertainment does have a very hard training and overworks his idols but don\u2019t every companies? *cough JYP* *cough give twice a- cough- break*. Lee SooMan is amazing, and only created bops and legends, and we must be thankful for that. He reminds me of my father, and any other Asian fathers, very strict from the outside but loves his kids genuinely. And that\u2019s Lee SooMan, don\u2019t you see how proud he gets when his artist get their 1st wins, he even visits his artist\u2019s concerts to support them and brags about them like a Mom lol. -Haters: But he hit TVXQ! -First, that was just from an article, it was never proved and the artists didn\u2019t say it themselves, second, JYP and other companies hit their idols. Jay Park himself said it, that the trainees at JYP would constantly get hit. That\u2019s just an Asian thing for discipline. At least he\u2019s not as creepy as JYP who always sexualizes females in his MVs and doesn\u2019t gamble with it\u2019s artist\u2019s money like YG. Also, SM himself is an Orbit, and helped produce Loona\u2019s \u201cSo What!\u201d If y\u2019all orbits aren\u2019t thankful for this amazing man then idk what to say. 4. SM ent. is the best company:It isn\u2019t the #1 company for nothing. Yes, the trainees are overworked and the training is extremely hard but that\u2019s simply because it\u2019s SM ent. The trainees need to work hard because it\u2019s an honor for them to be accepted there. Another reason is because it doesn\u2019t force a certain image on it\u2019s idols, like YG forces the baddie image and JYP the cute one. In SM groups they have multiple personalities, some members are quiet, while others are talkative, introverts and extroverts, baddies and cuties, colds and warms. Idols can honestly be themselves. They also diss Lee SooMan 24/ 7 and never get into problem, and that\u2019s another sign showing how humble SM is and they don\u2019t fear him at all. I\u2019m not surprised tho, SM himself goes to Halloween parties disguised lol. Plus there are no dating bans, instead they are encouraged to date. The idols in SM are more free. Even other idols recommend SM and not their own companies when fans want to join. Here is a photo of SM with his favorite kids.   Here\u2019s a photo of SM with older generation idols. I remember BoA even said that Lee Soo Man is like her father. And older generation idols said that SM was very caring of them and that they would like him back as the CEO. (I\u2019ll insert links or videos if I find some, I don\u2019t remember where exactly I got these informations as it used to be a while ago.) 6. Black Pink isn\u2019t the best girl group and Blinks are the most toxic fandom:Blinks will literally kill me for this. But guess what? I used to be a Blink myself. I never really stanned them but liked their music. But as soon as i saw how toxic the fandom is, i immediately left and i don\u2019t regret it. Armies have become mature these 2 years and aren\u2019t as childish as before, I can even say they have become one of the most respectful fandoms. But Blinks? Oh boy, just because me and my mom (who is a plastic surgeon) said that Lisa had rhinoplasty, they went crazy. They literally threatened my mom saying they will track her down, find her email/ job details and ruin her job. The hate i got was shocking. I know not all Blinks are like that, but we can only see the childish ones. That\u2019s how you guys protect your idols? By threatening people and sending hate? Grow up. Okay back to Black Pink, some of their songs are really nice, but they rarely have comebacks and are just a modern version of 2NE1. The only reason why i was a Blink was because of the amazing personalities these 4 girls have! Even if i\u2019m not a Blink anymore, i love all 4 members for who they are and not for what they do. Don\u2019t kill me for this, and calm down.  7. Fandoms should stop exaggerating stuff and ruining other the celebrities career.Here are 2 examples: 1. Do you remember when comedian/ host Shin Dong Yup teased Heechul after the dating news with him and Momo? And Onces went crazy saying he made her cry? That was just unbelievably stupid. Momo is an amazing and strong woman with a strong mentality, why would she cry? This is what happened: Heechul, Dong Yup and a female artist (idk her) were hosting an award ceremony, and Shin Dong Yup said: \u201cHeechul, i bet you\u2019re happy to see you\u2019re special people here\u201d. Heechul and Momo got embarrassed but he immediately continued saying: \u201dSuper Junior! I was talking about Super Junior!\u201d. Onces went crazy and spammed him with hate. But did they bother to know who Shin Dong Yup really is? I grew up watching him and he\u2019s like a hero. An extremely open minded, bright and funny person. He\u2019s an amazing adviser and teaches everyone to except people the way they are since he himself has a deaf brother. He protected/ defended idols who were getting hate/ were depressed his own way. Sulli was very very very happy to meet him before her suicide, she had nothing but good words about him.  2nd example: Do you remember when Blinks hated on Momoland and Nancy to have \u201cglared\u201d over Lisa and Black Pink out of \u201cjealousy\u201d since they won? What on earth was that? Nancy was exhausted after the performance and dozed out. Momoland were rising at that time and were finally getting the fame they deserve, but after this incident they were hated on, and are always accused of stealing music. This unintentional incident, ruined their careers. They started to rip apart and a couple members left the group because of the hate. Luckily, the hate has calmed down now. Show Momoland your love and support, they\u2019re amazing!  8. Super Junior and Exo are the best boy groups, Alongside NCT:Do i even need to explain? Nope. I love them with all my heart.   9. Leeteuk is the best K-pop Leader:This man is amazing and it\u2019s sad to see he still gets hate during these past 15 years for something he didn\u2019t even do. It\u2019s not his fault if his Father killed his Grandparents and then committed suicide to make ends meet. He never wanted this to happen. It\u2019s sad that people judge others not for who they are but where they come from. Do you know what\u2019s amazing in Leeteuk? The way he takes care of Super Junior. The members are so close and no one has left the group during these 15 years, except for kangin, who left because of personal reasons, and sungmin, inactive, because he got married. The way he leads his group is amazing. And do you know what is even more wonderful about him? His strong mentality. Imagine coming home from military and discovering that your grandparents were strangled by your Father and your Dad hanged himself after that. And his father\u2019s letter? \u201cDo you truly believe you achieved success all by yourself?\u201d Not only that, but he inherited all his father\u2019s debts. I would be heartbroken and exhausted, but he, even though that literally scarred his life, he continued, and despite the hate he gets and his depression, he continues and never gives up, for the sake of Super Junior, because of his love for Super Junior. \u2764\ufe0e  10. Loona is the best girl group, alongside Red Velvet:These two groups are amazing. No words can explain how much i love them and how amazing they are.   11. K-Quorans are the best and most mature K-pop fans:I literally love you mature K-Quorans so much. Like so much. So so much. You guys attack my heart with your kindness, love and sense of humor.  12. There\u2019s no Big 4:Seriously though, wtf is a Big 4?  There is, was, and will only be Big 3. What some fans don\u2019t get is that the Big # aren\u2019t the companies with the most popular artists, but it\u2019s the companies who helped form K-pop, who helped shape and make K-pop. And the companies who did that are SME: the one who basically started K-pop by debuting H.O.T, YGE: after Seo Taiji and boys, Yang Hyun suk made YGE and debuted his own groups, and JYPE: who followed their path. These 3 are the ones who created, started, and shaped K-pop and that\u2019s why they\u2019re called the Big 3. Not because they have famous groups. The ones who usually use the term Big 4 are newer K-pop fans so kids, there is no Big 4. Yup, that was it, thanks for reading!\u2764\ufe0e (all photos from google/ Quora) Edit: Don\u2019t blame Mr. Lee for Tao, Kris and Luhan. Exo debuted in 2011, a year after SM left :( ",

            "answer_text": "These are more like thoughts of my observations than just bland opinions. And there they go : Once a group or an k-idol start becoming widely popular and successful, people start to neglect the base they had to start with and hard work they had to begin and muster with: we all know the hardships the idols have to face to perform on the stage ; doing what they love to do. The stage we observe, the mvs we stream, the fanmeet we visit all seems so alluring. The concerts seems so mesmerizing at a point that the dream of performing among the crowds of thousands allures us too. For this point I won't be mentioning just one group or a fandom but as a whole. Imagine excitedly auditioning for a company, imagine the happiness of being selected and imagine the hit of euphoric waves to be able to get debuted. And this is what we just see. We ignore their hard work. The idols we love are getting hated. Some of the popular names let's include bts, twice, exo and blackpink . Bts was called a \u2018nugu' group meaning who in a sense unknown to all. Exo was hated for being a failure to sm. Twice was hated for their survival show being planned which was not. Last but not least blackpink was hated because they debuted when 2ne1 disbanded. The fandoms of each respective group know how much their idols had to suffer humiliation and loss of enthusiasm to continue what they liked to do for they had no idea what the future has stored for them. You know the feeling when you draw a picture of ur family members so enthusiastically and get ignored? The pain you feel is unexplainable and all you wanna do is cry and good thing is you can. But imagine being hated in your group just for breathing and you know what's worse? You can't even cry for you will be bashed out again for being unprofessional. The above mentioned groups are now hugely popular from east to west. When people first call kpop most of us will be strucked with their name, for they hold such popularity. And people think everything came easy to them just watching the present them winning the awards. And here comes the train of overwhelming hate which none of them deserve. Ik we all can't get into their songs they give to their fans but neither can we just send them endless hate and death threats. They are humans not puppets that are left to be played by us. And none of the idols we see had easy trainee periods. Just because they are popular now doesn't mean their past was any easy. They have worked hard for their present and we can't lose our humanity by typing hate comments than doing anything fruitful. Idols don't control our life and I think neither should you. . Most of the kpop fandom know about scandals but don't care about the truth about it being fake: This one is targeted particularly to one idol named lee taeyong. Does that name ring a bell? Yeah he is that idol known inside k-fandom for being a scammer and a bully. But does the fandom know that it was fake? Trust me even his own fandom we know as nctzens didn't know abt it. And I could see so many careless answers about taeyong saying taeyong this and taeyong that. AND GUESS WHAT HE KEPT THE PAIN IN HIMSELF. Why you may ask? For he was afraid his friends and his beloved ones might get hurt in the process. His scamming scandal was cleared to be fake 3 yrs ago and dispatch recently cleared his another scandal and yet, yet his own fandom doesn't acknowledge this truth. Admit it all we want is drama to enjoy. . People lack knowledge about whether a group is popular or successful:Popular is being known locally or internationally known. Such groups have fame in the line of streams and views. Successful means when a group outstands most of the ticks in the field of streams as well as concert ticket and album sales. The examples are for u to choose since my examples could bring fan wars on the comment sections. . When a group is privileged that doesn't mean they had it any easy : This is sth that needs to spoken about. The big 3 or 4 you say does exist. Why do you think the kpop fandom knows their rookie groups more than others? But that doesn't mean you can hate them. Remember when you work for a higher level, higher expectations are kept in you. All the eyes are laid upon you keeping track of ur every movement. Yeah they might have access to more facilities but where in the world is that their fault? They have expectations to fulfill which are higher than ur grades combined in your entire life. And you say the privilege got them easy? Nice joke but that wasn't hilarious. . Svt totally deserved their 4th win for left and right : Seventeen totally overshadowed other groups in Korean market during their comeback, earning a huge success in the kpop industry. They outsold a million album sales . They had high streams. Svt may not be popular internationally but in Korea they are one of the top 3 boy groups along with bts and exo. Svt ofc got a win for their cb but guess what the comment section was exploded with hate spilling nonsense that said svt didn't deserve the win. If u ask me understimating svt's popularity could take a troll on you. If u do underestimate their popularity, ur being delulu a huge one especially. If you go to streets of Korea and say svt is a wallflower group, people might volunteer you to show the way to mental hospital. . Racism in kpop exists be it in the form of non Asian or Asian race : Things about cultural appropriation has been a lot heated lately in kpop. From cornrows to wearing of durags idols are being dragged towards immense hate. And I wonder why in the world people can't see the purpose of hair dresser and their stylist and how in the world is others work their idol's fault. Let me tell you we asians are taught about such appropriations from little to none in context. Just educate them, bringing unnecessary hate is just unnecessary. When people think about racism, they forget about the racism we asians have to face. Why in the world do you think people still bad mouth about the music preference we have? They talk about how they look and does that ring a bell? Yeah that's venom dripping out of their mouth filled with racism for our race ; for what we are, for how we look. And yeah don't just stretch your eye corners, it's inappropriate to us in the same way cornrows seemed to u. Our eyes are senses for us to see not a trend for others to follow. . People either love or hate a popular or successful group for attention :Let's be serious. Tell me how many answers do you encounter saying our fandom is the most toxic, the worst out of all and deserves to be thrown out. Tell me how many people do you encounter in social medias bad mouthing your fav group or idol. Tell me how many people do you see in social medias acting as if they like your idol for attention? It's a lot. And what's the funniest part? It works!!!! They get reactions and comments and my dear kpopies that's what they want. They want attention and you're giving it to them. So when I see such people I usually ignore reacting to their posts. The way they squirm for attention is really amusing to watch. . . We all are made up of Stardust but unlike stars we can decide whether to be the brightest one or the black hole. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the second time I am answering this type of question but anyway, get ready for some shade: Boy with luv is an okay song, but not song of the year, it is not as good as other BTS songs, the only reason it won so many awards because of the huge fandom. Give it to a group with average to below average popularity, it will flop.MR removed videos aren\u2019t that reliable, stop evaluating someone\u2019s vocal capabilities by watching them: Live singing isn\u2019t everything, there are more criterias. Also mr removed can be edited, twisted to sound bad or better than it is.Talent isn\u2019t everything and is definitely not the deciding factor in this industry. When I first knew Kpop, I was really childish and thought visual members with little talents are useless and don\u2019t deserve their fame, that you must be super talented to actually deserve anything. Now I realize what is really important is the star quality that JYP talks about. In survival shows, it\u2019s not the most talented ones that win, it\u2019s the people who manage to grab the audience\u2019s attention and shine onstage. That\u2019s why the best dancers and singers from SIXTEEN got eliminated, you rely too much on your skills. If you want to maintain your fame, you have to be flexible and be interesting in different ways. Another fundamental factor is a good personality. You can destroy your career if your attitude isn\u2019t very nice. And no, I am not underestimating the value of talents. But you need way more than talent to be the star of your group. That\u2019s why Lisa, Momo, Yeji, V, etc are so popular anyway. They are talented but they manage to stand out onstage, which come to my next point:Wonyoung does well enough as center, Chaeyeon\u2019s rank should have been higher but not the 1st place. I am speaking this as a person who supported Chaeyeon from the start. The 12th rank pissed me off, she should have been in the top 5 or top 3. But you know what, I wouldn\u2019t give her the center spot because she doesn\u2019t suit it. I always see her as some type of wildcards like Chungha, Momo but not someone who represent everyone like Nayeon. Nayeon\u2019s existence screams TWICE, that\u2019s what a center is. To be honest, IZ*ONE concept is too girly for her anyway. She would make the excellent center in a WM girl group. I would give her more important lines and a good amount of center time instead. And no, she is not underrated at all, the company knows and promoted her dancing quite well and she is one of the most loved. The only problems are her screen time and her style which the stylist is too lazy to change. For Wonyoung, she wasn\u2019t my dream center but she doesn\u2019t deserve all the hate thrown at her on her birthday either. She suits the concept pretty well. She actually does have some kind of presence onstage and she\u2019s 15, give her a chance.Not stanning a kpop group because of the fandom is totally okay. I have listened to a lot of groups and artists and I like a lot of them, TWICE, BLACKPINK, BTS,etc. However, I find the fandom too toxic and childish to be part of. Most of the time I am just a silent supporter and that is totally okay. You might call me childish and a fake stan but you are supposed to be happy, feeling positive when listening to music and seeing idols, not dealing with toxic people 24/7. Just because you are in the same fandom does not mean they are going to treat you nicely. Leave when you feel uncomforable. I only join a fandom when I really know it is suitable for me. Most of the time, I am just a silent supporterStanning idol does not mean worshipping them like a perfect human being, it is totally okay to accept your idols have weaknesses: I mean fans often accuse when a self proclaimed fan who said that:\u201dEven though A is my bias, I think X is better at dancing/singing/etc than A\u201d for being a fake fan. For me those oversensitive fans are hypocrites. Just because my bias is Mina does not mean I am going to go around saying she dances better than Momo. No, that is just stupid. In my opinion, a true fan love the perfect and imperfect in their idols. Idols are only humans, they make mistakes, they are not good at a particular stuff. Always babying your idols and not accepting their weak points is actually a harmful way of supporting.Everglow use ads, so what? As a matter fact, almost all kpop groups nowadays use ads, even the big 3 groups. Moreover, Youtube has already stopped counting views from ads, they have lots of real views, just accept the truth. You just find the pettiest reasons to hate on someone because you feel threatenedStop with the conception that visuals are useless Astro\u2019s Cha Eunwoo brought up his group\u2019s popularity with his visuals. Irene brings a lot of attention to her group. Without Hani, EXID would have disbanded long ago. Be grateful for what they have contributed and stop hating on them and autonatically brand them as talentless. Suzy is a well-rounded idol, IOI/Pristin\u2019s Kyulkyung was both a good dancer and a nice vocalist.Somi doesn\u2019t deserve the hate she got after leaving JYPE: Look, she doesn\u2019t hate Twice and she is still pretty close with some of them, especially Chaeyoung. Somi is young, she is impulsive and can make rash and immature actions, but does an Instagram post speak all about someone\u2019s character? No. Somi are close with plenty of sunbaenims like Zico or Taeyeon, if she was disrespectful or bitchy, no one would have wanted to befriend her. Her interaction with Itzy\u2019s 01 line was nothing but nice. And no, she isn\u2019t taking advantage of Twice. All 9 girls are older, more experienced and they know what they are doing, they are not your babies. So toxic stans need to shut up. And stop saying she should be in a group or stay with JYP, yes, I liked her as a GG member more but if idols are enjoying what they are doing in the moment, there is no need to keep questioning and trying to change her decision.",

But yes it doesn\u2019t mean those who don\u2019t are untalented or less worthy there is nothing wrong with it at all. 2) YG is shit yes but people using the whole \u2018YG does not let Blackpink produce because he is misogynistic\u2019 excuse is bullshit.
