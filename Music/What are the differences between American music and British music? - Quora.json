            "answer_text": "umm.. In America we can pronounce vowels better? just joking.. Being from America I was totally blind sided that most Australians listen to country music. I thought that was more an American thing. Now that I know more about what other countries like to listen to, I would honestly have to say that there isn\u2019t a lot of difference that I can tell. There is a sound that Canadian music has, its barely even noticeable, but it is there. Its still the same music. There is a San Fransisco sound, an L.A. sound, A Nashville sound, a Houston sound, an East coast sound and so on, but it is in all the different music that we all listen to. British groups often have a British sound, and still they have the same music as anyone else. So ultimately I don\u2019t really see a difference that I could actually point a finger at and talk about. But there is an overall sound component that slightly changes the flavor of what ever country or region it comes from. That\u2019s all I can really say. ",

The US has a bigger scene of solo artists, such as: Selena GomezRihannaElvis PresleyBeyonc\u00e9Michael JacksonEminemThe UK also has its own genre, grime. Grime originated from UK garage music, and is now mostly some type of rap. It\u2019s not, however, a sub-genre of rap, even though you\u2019d maybe think so. It also includes a lot of British slang which you would never hear an American say (like peng (ting), wagwan, blud, mate, etc). Some well-known grime artists include: StormzySkeptaJmeDizzee RascalGiggsTempa TOther than this, it\u2019s mostly the same, just add a British accent (not necessary). ",
