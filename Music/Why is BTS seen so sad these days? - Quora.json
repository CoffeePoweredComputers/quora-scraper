            "answer_text": "BTS can empathize with the pain, and sorrow they feel, for the pandemic, and how frustrating it is to be locked up in your own home, without any sign, any glimmer of hope that this would be all over and they will be able to get back to their normal lives. It is even worse to just sit there and do nothing, when all you can do is to do nothing and if doing nothing is something, then why does it still feel like doing nothing. They miss doing the things they used to do, as with all of us, facing this crisis right now, and everything they have planned as been postponed indefinitely, and it is like taking away what they have, ripping them from something they love, and not knowing g when they will get it back because they are not in cotnrol, and to not have control of things in life, is not a life worth living, which is why it frustrates them and it is expressed through tears, tears of anger, sadness, frustration, and resentment for this, and just desperation fro all of this to end, because they just want to have everything back, and they have realized the importance of it all, of everything they used to take for granted everything they didn't pay any close attention to, didn't appreciate, and didn't acknowledge the importance of in their life, but now, they have, and while this is a time they could relax, and unwind, and do the things they haven't done before, it still doesn't mean that they still don't want to let go of the things they love, especially when this time has helped them to realize that just how important that thing is in their life and how it is their life. Losing it would be a life unlived, and I think that is what people are most afraid of. They are afraid of living life without purpose, and shoutout meaning, and to feel like you can\u2019t do anything for yourself, and for others, is just unsettling because what is the point of life then. What purpose do we serve? But BTS are trying the best they can, like all of us, and trying to overcome this situation so they can go back to living their life with purpose, with meaning, and to finally to return to all of the things that give their life purpose and meaning, and reconnect with their passion, their love, and their craft, and to feel life they once did, alive, because all life seems right now, is bleak, desolate, and just dead.

            "answer_text": "I should think that that would be obvious\u2014they are beyond frustrated with COVID.  Like the rest of us. BTS are entertainers who had planned and prepared for a full tour just before COVID hit and they miss performing. They miss ARMY. They miss the normality that COVID has taken away from the world. I\u2019m sure each of the members is spending their time well\u2014rehearsing, doing online interviews and performances, taking breaks they normally wouldn\u2019t have and everything else that BTS do behind the scenes\u2014but it doesn\u2019t change that they miss the world as it was. They don\u2019t like being \u201clocked up\u201d anymore than we do and Jimin quite clearly reminded everyone that BTS are human too. They want to be with their friends, families and ARMY, like before. TTFN! ",
