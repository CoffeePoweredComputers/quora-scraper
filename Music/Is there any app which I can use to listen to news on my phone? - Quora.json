            "answer_text": "Oh wow\u2026 so many apps out there haha. Okay, here are my 5 recommendations. I own a news app, so I test competitors often so I know the good ones. I am going to assume, you want to be able to listen and read. Not all apps support listen only mode. SmartNews- read only, lots of great contentAudiBrow.com- Listen or Read, content from over 15 channelsApple News- read only. However, at this point limited to iOS devicesGood News- read only. Quick scan headlinesReuters- read and watch mode. Lots of global and local content.Hope this helps you. Enjoy. Tips: try not to overdo the news content. 15 mins is all you need in the morning to know what's going on. Tips: if you prefer to listen, use apps like AudiBrow to listen to news while you drive or at the gym. ",
