            "answer_text": "Hello, Carmen! Here are some things I was able to find about Freddie Mercury and his favorite food(s): Favorite food: spare ribs with onion sauce, chili con carne, Indian food, Chinese food, spicy food in general. http://www.mercury-and-queen.com/miscellaneous.htm This is from a blog by Phoebe Freestone: As for food, when I started working for him Freddie loved spicy food, not necessarily chili hot, but a good mix of spice. This was natural if you think back to his birthplace, Zanzibar, the spice island, and his mother would have prepared many traditional parsi dishes for him. During my time with Freddie he did like traditional \u2018home cooking\u2019, as well as the 5* gourmet restaurants. He always used to say at home he wanted mother\u2019s cooking\u2026. For deluxe food there were plenty of restaurants to choose from. As his illness progressed so his taste buds suffered and he couldn\u2019t take strong flavors. At that time we started cooking food with much less spice and made it easy to eat food. A perfect example of that progression was with scrambled eggs. At the start I always cooked the Indian variety with chili and spices, that he remembered from his youth, but by the last year it was served with only a small sprinkling of salt and pepper. There should be a link to a recipe book that I brought out last year which would give you a good idea of what was presented to Freddie over the years.

            "answer_text": "Per request. I tried to message you to say you should read Nancy Massi\u2019s answer. It is thorough and correct as I can recall reading all of those things. He had his fancy chef learn his mom\u2019s Indian recipes. During the last year or so of his life every Thursday when he visited his mom she sent him home with a container of the same Indian cheese biscuits that he loved as a child. You can see him holding one of them in one of the last few photos taken of him as he was returning home from his parent\u2019s home. Phoebe also mentioned that a recipe known as Coronation Chicken was often served at parties so he was very fond of it as well. Also, he was not big on sweets or desserts and although he seemed to relish good food he was known for not actually eating much of it and for pushing food around on his plate after a while, always leaving some on his plate. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he lost interest in meals quickly as he was very energetic and wanted to get on to the next thing. According to his PA he thought three things were a waste of time\u2014eating, sleeping and shaving. He probably did not like having to stop whatever he was doing in order to grab something to eat. He only needed four hours of sleep as it was. Oops. Update: Apparently he also liked \u201cfriiiieeeddd chicken\u201d. As you probably know, he sang that instead of \u201cOne Vision\u201d for the last line of the song by the same name. Lol. ",
