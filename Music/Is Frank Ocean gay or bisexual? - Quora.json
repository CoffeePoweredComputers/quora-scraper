            "answer_text": "Personally, I think he's neither. This is the post on his tumblr, in which he \"came out\".Link: http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/26473798723  However, when you read the post, all it says is that 4 years prior to coming out, he had a relationship with a man, he was in love with him, and that it has influenced some of the music he's written - he never came out as gay or bisexual. Even in interviews since he wrote that post, Like his GQ interview, (http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201212/frank-ocean-interview-gq-december-2012) He doesn't specifically say whether he's gay or bisexual:  \"I'll respectfully say that life is dynamic and comes along with dynamic experiences, and the same sentiment that I have towards genres of music, I have towards a lot of labels and boxes and sh*t. As a writer, as a creator, I'm giving you my experiences. But just take what I give you. You ain't got to pry beyond that. I'm giving you what I feel like you can feel.\"  The way I see it, is like this: Frank Ocean once had a relationship with a man. Having a relationship with a man doesn't inherently make you gay or bisexual. But that relationship is an important part of his life, and he's choosing not to hide it. ",

            "answer_text": "If he hasn't labeled himself, we shouldn't presume to assign him a label. It's his lived experience - it's up to him to identify (or not) as he pleases and we should respect that. As an aside, I believe that the system that demands that individuals define their sexuality using set 'boxes' is inherently oppressive, and by refusing to follow that paradigm he is doing a really positive thing. He's subverting the system and showing that assuming that individuals must fall into one of very few externally imposed identities is a fundamentally flawed way of thinking. ",
