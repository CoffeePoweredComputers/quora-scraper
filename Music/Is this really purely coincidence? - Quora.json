If they haven\u2019t(and I doubt they have), how do I know they didn\u2019t pick the longest objects that would come out to 10 to the 41st power ratio to all the shortest objects in the universe(also impossible to measure).

The longest time should be the age of the universe, which is approximately 14 billion years, or ~ 4.4 \u00d7 10^17 s. Obviously, the ratio of the two is very far from 10^41. \u2014 you could have rotated that image, my neck hurts :) ",
