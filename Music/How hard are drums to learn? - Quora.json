            "answer_text": "It depends on your learning goals. Fun: If your goal is just to entertain yourself and have fun while playing some rhythms and drum fills. Drums are definitely the easiest. I play in a big band, and drumset is many players' (bass players, trumpetists, clarinetists, etc.) second favorite. You can learn a lot in a couple of days. More than any instrument probably. Playing a Song: If your goal is to play a song with a band. You can still achieve your goal quite easily depending on the music style and the song you are going to play. I remember accompanying to basic hard rock songs (including some rhythm variations and drum fills) without making huge errors after 2 months of study. Concert: Depending on your talent level, you can start playing in a level that is enough to play in front of an audience within 1-3 years. (My estimation is based on my observations and personal experience, also I assume you are going to be playing pop or rock.) Mastering: If your goal is to be able to play different musical styles while having your own touch and being able to do original drum solos, then drums are certainly one of the hardest. Because it is quite challenging to be original and to be the backbone of the whole band/orchestra at the same time. Also, take into account that it is much harder to play decent solos with drumset compared to the guitar, piano, or saxophone. To sum up, It is easy to learn drums in the beginning but it gets harder as you progress compared to other instruments. My personal opinion is that many other typical instruments (piano, guitar,..) are a bit harder to learn in the beginning but easier to progress comparatively. So you experience the diminishing returns differently: What is the law of diminishing returns? One side note: I would like to add is that drums do not mean much without other instruments. If you can get the chance to practice with other musicians you will learn faster. Unfortunately, sometimes people learn to play drums, but they do not learn it musically so they can't play drums along with the music so well. ",

            "answer_text": "I knew I was musically inclined when I was 5 years old, but my parents flatly refused to get a guitar, my first choice, or drums, my second. They never supported my efforts. My mother\u2019s dead, and my father\u2019s 91. Neither ever saw, or has seen me me play. I learned drums on a set owned by a friend when I was 14. He showed me how to hold the sticks, that\u2019s all. I practiced like a madman, one limb at a time until I could put all together. One year later, I turned professional, and I\u2019ve played for almost 51 years. I also taught myself Bass guitar when I was 28. I still play both, never having one lesson from anyone on either instrument. I\u2019m damn good at what I do, but there\u2019s always someone better, trust me. Now, as to difficulty, drums require training all four limbs to do certain movements. I didn\u2019t sing lead or harmony until 20 years into my career. It was like learning all over again. It was NOT easy! Now it\u2019s second nature. Bass isn\u2019t that hard, really. I taught myself to play it in two weeks, but it took two YEARS to start getting good at it. You have to have an innate rhythm to play any instrument. If you can dance, or just tap along to the music, you\u2019ve got what you need to start. It also depends on how MUCH you want to learn an instrument. Practice is mandatory. You can\u2019t walk away from it for a year and expect to come back and do as well as you did before you quit. And finally, don\u2019t EVER let someone tell you that you can\u2019t do it. Go over them, get past them, and get the naysayers out of your life. That was my mistake early on; I didn\u2019t. After I wised up, things got MUCH better. If you want to make some sort of career of it, rest assured there\u2019s plenty of backstabbers that were here before you,and they\u2019ll do their best to keep you down, especially if they see you\u2019re good at what you do. Again, don\u2019t let them get to you. Do your best always. It really pisses those kinds of people off. Even if you never get to play Carnegie Hall, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity in playing in someone\u2019s weekend band, or maybe full time in a road band. It depends on what you want. Best of luck! ",
