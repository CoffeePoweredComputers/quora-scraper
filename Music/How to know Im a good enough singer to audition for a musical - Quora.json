            "answer_text": "The previous poster gave excellent advice.  I have some additional questions for you. You are good enough to audition simply because it's an open audition or \"cattle call\". Which of these questions is more accurate: 1. Am I good enough to get a part in the show once I audition? 2. Will this audition tell me if I am a good performer? 3.  Will this audition launch me on the path to stardom? 1.  I can't tell you if you are a good enough singer to get in a show.  One audition won't tell you that either.  As a teacher, I'd need to be face to face with you to give you the best shot at it that I could.  Please do sing for family and friends and ask for honest feedback.  If this is something you really want to do, get a teacher.  They're will be honest and bring out the best your voice has to offer. The problem with auditions is, you,ve got 16 measures of a song to show what you can do.  If you're having an off day, if you're sick, if you just had a fight, if someone waiting to audition psychs you out before you go on stage, any of these can affect your audition.   The other problem is you don't know what they are looking for.  You could be too tall, too short, too fat, too thin, too blonde, too brunette, just not the right presentation they are looking for.  So not getting a part could have nothing to do with talent. I say all this to try to show you that there is more than just talent that affects the outcome and it will be easier on you if you can NOT TAKE IT PERSONAL if you don't get a part. 2.  This audition will not tell you if you are a great performer.  Performance is a learned skill.  You have to do it a lot to get good at it.  Like the previous poster said, get out and perform your audition material to anyone who will listen.  Learn what it feels like to make a major mistake.  Then learn what it feels like to recover from mistakes.  Do it again and again till people tell you it's perfect, but we know everyone screws up, you're just learning how to get around mistakes so no one can tell.  Doing it is what makes you a good performer. 3.  I doubt it?  I mean stranger things have happened, but it's sort of the \"winning the lottery\" scenario.  It happens, but not to many people.  What this audition can do for you, win or lose, is teach you about the process of theater.  If you can take being told \"no\" a lot, even if you land this one, if you can take being treated like a puppet to fit in a play, if you can keep it from getting personal and feeling like rejection, you will learn a lot, and you will learn to take any audition and make it your time to shine. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, you to realize what you control in the audition, and what you do not control...  (1) You (the performer) control how much you prepare.  \"Practice, practice, practice\" is the way... they are not just empty words.  So0, find the rubric -- that list of expectations that are published with the audition posting, and do your best to both meet and exceed the posted expectations.  (2) Perform in a number of settings prior to the audition.  Perform for friends and colleagues as often as possible.  Accompanied, some a cappella (solo).  Get used to performing the performance under all sorts of conditions, and under all sorts of \"issues\" and \"problems\".  It will make the actual audition -- which SHOULD run smoothly -- run easier on your nerves.   (3) Seek credible, positively-oriented critiques.  And listen to their suggestions.   ",
