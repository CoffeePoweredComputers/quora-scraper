            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not even going to look at it, and here\u2019s why: nearly every attempt at a perpetual motion machine/free energy machine is based in ordinary mechanics or basic electromagnetism. We know what those theories say. Energy is conserved. Therefore the perpetual motion machine is phony. It\u2019s like chess. Say you have a bishop alone on a chessboard, sitting on a white square. You claim to me that by making a long sequence of legal moves, you can put it on a black square. You\u2019re wrong; I know it because each and every individual move keeps the bishop on a white square. There is no loophole. And when you insist, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t looked at my method, I start with 6 moves of length 2, then 8 moves of length 1, then\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t even have to look. I have a proof that it doesn\u2019t work. That does NOT mean that free energy machines are impossible. It means that any such machine must violate the laws of physics as we know them. So if you are making a complex device, and say, \u201cthen this spring winds up, then electrical energy is stored here, then that mass moves down\u2026\u201d you are describing individual steps each of which is known to obey conservation of energy. You cannot add up a dozen or a hundred or ten million steps, each of which conserve energy, and get something that violates energy conservation. Just like you can add finite even numbers all day long and you will never get an odd number. I don\u2019t have to look at your particular sequence of numbers. If they are all even, the sum will be even. No loopholes. Any device worth a look will have some specific step or steps where conservation of energy is violated. That phenomenon is the interesting part. Throw away the rest of your machine and just look at that step. State exactly what happens, exactly how to set it up, what our current laws of physics predict will happen, what you predict will happen instead\u2014preferably with an explanation or theory, but that can wait if need be\u2014and do the experiment. If you have something real, engineers will make a million different free energy devices out of it. When I was a kid, I wanted to grow up to invent a warp drive. But I didn\u2019t start slapping together engine parts and hoping. I studied math and physics. I looked for the edges, the frontiers, the places where things haven\u2019t been fully tested yet or the explanations are shaky\u2014in other words, I made a beeline for quantum mechanics. You have to have a phenomenon. Something you can observe, something simple where more energy comes out than goes in. Burying it in bells and whistles just hides the fact that there is nothing there in the center. If there is something there, you don\u2019t need to hide it. If you think you have a complex device that provides free energy, trim it down, take away everything non-essential. Remove the fog of doubt. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Being a major theoretical perpetual motion enthusiast myself I had a personal conversation with the designer of that device some years ago, I think it was in 2009 - 2010 (I could be wrong) about the time he posted his video and was beginning to receive comments. What he said to me is that \"It doesn't work... But I am afraid to admit the truth... I think I will just go on lying because I want to.\" This is approximately exactly what he said to me. And when I asked about the toy models, I think he said it worked \"because of a spring\". So, possibly the toy works, but only if you attach a spring. In other words, it is not really perpetual, but does work as a toy. Either that, or he's lying about the toy, too. I for one have not bought the toy. Anyway, the V-gate motor vertical wheel is not real perpetual motion. There is one possible design I have noticed that might have potential, similar to a V-gate that may come from a different hobbyist, but there is no report of it's being fully perpetual yet:  My contribution to V-Gate: I finally see what you are doing here. 12/2018 (It is unrelated to most of my designs, as I do not use magnets). I thought it was worth pointing that you could have vertical repulsion on the lever end, possible efficiency there. \u2014YouTube Comment ",
