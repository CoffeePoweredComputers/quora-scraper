            "answer_text": "I would suggest learning Chord Piano. This is the easiest way to learn music theory without taking a class or taking lessons. It sounds like you might be able to pick up Chord Piano relatively quickly, since you already have a flair for incorporating different chords and improvisation in your playing. In terms of technique, I heard a lack of wrist rolling in your playing; watch videos that have pianists' hands prominently displayed. You might be surprised what you can discover.  Be cognizant of where your hands are on the keys; sit on the bench straight, extend your hands out; do your hands rest comfortably above the keys? (your shoulders back, back straight). If they don't, you might be too low or too high on the bench, depending on how your hands fit on the keyboard you are playing. Unfortunately, playing on a keyboard is bad for your wrists; if you can find a piano to practice on, that would be best. Don't try to do any huge pieces on a keyboard; the keys are just not quite as good for you as a pianos'.  Here is an interesting site (there are some free videos, but I think there are actual lessons that you can buy, if you are so inclined): piano lessons via DVD and online  This is a great TED talk on Classical Music and on piano playing: The transformative power of classical music This pianist has great technique, you could watch him, as well.   And, of course, Practice Practice Practice. For your reference: Learning Piano: At what key should I press which finger?

            "answer_text": "You know what?   Don't fret.   It all depends on why you play an instrument.   If you plan to play with people who can read music then learning theory makes sense.   But if you can find a tune simply by listening and copying and even improvising you have a skill that many music scholars lack and if you're only playing for fun why force yourself to learn a skill you may not need.    I have a friend who plays fiddle; his forte is folk music and he is brilliant but he cannot read music.   The thing about much folk music is that it is simply passed from one person to the next because a group of people get together and play.   A new member joins or maybe someone simply drops in for an evening.   Music is exchanged, maybe a new technique is passed on.   In many ways, that is what you're doing already, it's just you work alone. Can you improve your technique, your fingering for example?   Possibly, I might even say probably but do you need to do that to do what you want? So my first suggestion is to continue enjoying yourself.   If you find there is a piece you want to learn and you can't work it out don't look for a teacher, look for someone who plays that piece and then learn from them. Only if you really want to learn dots, play complex music with others do you really need classes. ",
