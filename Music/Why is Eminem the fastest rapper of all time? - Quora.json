            "answer_text": "Eminem isn\u2019t the fastest rapper of all time. he falls into the decently fast category including Joyner Lucas,Krizz Kaliko... Next up are the choppers like Splyt Second, Twisted Insane, Tech N9ne, Busta Rhymes and several others. If you want the fastest rappers then look at Interchopper,Crucified,Rebel XD,Don Xperto,Outsider,El Chojin,The Jackal and 2\u20133 more. Crrucified is the fastest rapper hitting 28 syllables per second in his song Power Up. Crucified remains safely untouched in the English rapper category while Outsider,Don Xperto and El Chojin are a bit trickier and can\u2019t qualify for the fastest rapper in the world because they don\u2019t speak English ",
