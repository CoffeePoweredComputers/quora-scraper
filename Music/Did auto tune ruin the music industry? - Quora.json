            "answer_text": "No more than any other studio technique. I mean, if you want to really say what ruined the industry, it was the digital workstation, which allowed you to easily edit things\u2026 \u2026wait, no, it was the Eventide Harmonizer. Microshifting was the original way to hide bad notes\u2026 \u2026no, no, my bad, it was tape splicing. A good editor with a razor blade could make seamless fixes from multiple takes\u2026 \u2026hang on, no, blame Les Paul, he created multitracking and overdubbing, allowing artists to make multiple takes and mix them together\u2026 \u2026so, okay, look, here\u2019s the thing. Autotune is just another in a long line of studio tools and techniques used to make recordings sound good and save boatloads of cash on studio time rental. Honestly Autotune itself isn\u2019t even used that much anymore, since it\u2019s been largely superseded by other tools. And heck, I bet you heard songs that you thought didn\u2019t have autotune or something similar that actually did. Or songs that you thought did, that didn\u2019t. Blaming a single tool for the supposed decline of an entire industry [[citation needed]] is kind of silly. It\u2019s like asking if the compressed-air nail gun ruined the construction industry, because it took all the craftsmanship out of hammering. Maybe modern radio pop over-relies on pitch correction - it\u2019s just the pop sound du jour, the way big stacked vocals were in the 70\u2019s and Aphex Exciter harmonic enhancement was in the late 80\u2019s - but this too shall pass. Meanwhile the \u201cindustry\u201d is far broader and deeper than just radio pop, and it\u2019s doing just fine both with and without autotune. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not, though it has ruined a lot of individual songs over the last few decades. In the 90s, movie studios started using CGI\u2026 a lot. The technology was new and exciting, and it saved a tonne of resources compared to complicated practical effects. Movie studios smirked and went ahead with lots of CGI work. They had it made.  They were so happy that they chose to ignore what was obvious to the layman, that it wasn\u2019t any good. It wasn\u2019t aesthetically pleasing. It didn\u2019t serve the narrative. It was distracting. It didn\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d with the style of the film. It was a bit nifty, but that\u2019s shallow. It made for forgettable, immediately dated, bad art. That overuse of CGI didn\u2019t ruin the movie industry, but it definitely ruined those movies. Eventually, CGI was used more sparingly and in better taste. Many contemporary movies use CGI that you would never notice. It\u2019s been rolled tastefully into the final product, and serves the vision of the artist first and foremost. This is a repeated theme in art/music history that involves new techniques being used inappropriately. Eventually, the novelty wears off, and then the technique is either normative, or tossed into the DVD bin of history. Sometimes, it\u2019s overt. \u201cLet\u2019s show off our awesome new technology with this movie. People have never seen huge blue people on screen in 3D before, so this novelty will put butts in the movie theater\u201d. Whatever you end up creating with that perspective is a technical demonstration, and cheapens the work itself as art. If I go to an animation-themed trade show or conference, I\u2019ll likely see a bunch of booths with people standing beside televisions, some of them showing beautiful lighting engines, liquid simulations, fire effects, 3D effects, etc. These \u201cfilms\u201d aren\u2019t meant to be \u201cgood\u201d. They\u2019re meant to show off a novel technology that animators aren\u2019t aware of and can potentially add to their toolkit, so that they can ultimately be used to create something \u201cgood\u201d. People know that watching a short demo video of simulated water crashing on a beach isn\u2019t very interesting to anyone who doesn\u2019t work in tech, and that\u2019s fine, because at a trade show, it isn\u2019t the goal. The demonstration is the goal, not the art. Sometimes, it\u2019s not overt. It\u2019s a subconscious accident, an artifact of the personalities that make art. Movies and music alike are made by technicians in large part \u2014 editors, cinematographers, audio engineers, studio producers, post-production animators, etc. \u2014 and technicians get really excited about new tech, obviously\u2026 That\u2019s why they chose to be technicians. For a music producer, or film editor, seeing the newest technology in action is exciting. The excitement the engineer feels when he hears the newest auto-tune plugin or sees the latest After Effects flame animation can easily be confused for the excitement one feels when faced with genuine beauty and inspiration. \u201cHoly shit! That sounds awesome!\u201d is a feeling a tech nerd gets from both great art, and great tech demos. However, for the general public, and the judgmental hindsight of the future, art is exciting because of its beauty, the message it carries, the story it tells, the aesthetic experience\u2026. not the techniques that went into making it. The only thing left after a given time is the work itself, with much less of the temporary novelty of the process. The best art places little value on the technique of the artist (sophisticated 20th-century explorations of this question excluded). Nobody but the other carpenters cares what type of hammer you used to build a house, as long as the house functions as a house should. When these two approaches get conflated, you get bad art. It becomes dated almost immediately. Nobody cares what brush Da Vinci used. (I\u2019m sure you art students out there do, but ye\u2019 get the point.) The brush the artist uses is a vehicle, a tool, a way to get somewhere beautiful. Keeping the CGI example in mind as a similar case, Auto-tune is a newcomer to the music scene. It\u2019s the newest brush. It\u2019s only about 20 years old, and having it available to all studios for a nominal fee is only about 10 years old. I have half a dozen auto-tune plugins, and I don\u2019t even remember if I bought them or if they just came bundled in with other software. Studios and music producers are using auto-tune because it sounds new and hip, not because it\u2019s good music. Some of it is just cynical market manipulation, because they don\u2019t care if their music is popular in 5 years. It\u2019s about this quarter and the radio charts next week. All of this is to say that new technology in art always temporarily distorts the tastes and choices of the art-makers. Auto-tune will settle into the music industry over the next few years, and then it will be subtle, pleasing, unnoticeable. The best artists will use it like they do a guitar, a trill, a violin, or a crescendo. It will be just another colour on a palette of many colours. Over the last two years, I\u2019ve been working exclusively in VR with spatial music. It\u2019s very difficult to avoid this trap myself. VR technology is so revolutionary that it shoves good taste out the window. I\u2019m not even trying to make \u201cgood art\u201d at this point. I\u2019m completely trapped in the \u201ctech demo\u201d side of the picture. I\u2019m trying to nail down a process for VR music that will allow talented artists to create good music eventually, but I have to get through the valley of tasteless tech-nerd music to get there. Hopefully, I don\u2019t confuse one for the other when it counts. ",

But I\u2019d say it had a hand in it and was partially responsible for the decline in quality of the majority of contemporary music. Like everything else, it was once a fresh new tool and now has become an overused device. It\u2019s inescapable. A cliche. But along with it came a serious lack of talent. It seems these days all you have to do is be charismatic, attractive and in the eyes of youngsters everywhere to look cool. And if you fit somewhere within these confines then, the producers and studios will do the rest. Now certainly there must be someone out there with true musical talent but they are few and far between and most of these artists will never find a mainstream audience and success, let alone be recognized for their outstanding talent. But sadly musical prowess and knowledge is no longer taken so seriously. It seems all this generation wants to do as little as possible and get the most they can out of life. Today, I\u2019d say the music industry is just like any assembly line of products. It gets assembled in the factory and is packaged and sold at breakneck speed just like the cheap barely edible stuff you find at a fast food joint. The main problem? Rarely do today\u2019s musical performers have a recognizable style. I\u2019d say honestly that most of the stuff recorded these days is generic and cookie cutter stuff. Staying safe instead of taking chances and risks and heaven forbid, actually learning to play instruments proficiently! Alas, music will never be special like it once was. ",

Here\u2019s an expert that really knows his stuff:  This STP stripping of one of their awesome tracks will give you an idea of this guy\u2019s talent, and how he can recognize the talent that it actually takes to create great Rock. And here he breaks down what he sees as Auto tune\u2019s part in the demise of Rock (if the demise is indeed real, I myself don\u2019t necessarily think this is true\u2014purely an amateur\u2019s pov).  This is just a great video on the history of Rock and its ties and roots with the Blues. I think you have to take into consideration the totality of what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a lot of great music out there, but there\u2019s much more crap. Maybe that\u2019s always been the case? Why do I think this might be true? Because when we look at great rock, heck, we can count the awesome bands that we love with four hands. Now, that is over an almost 70 year period since Rock & Roll came into existence. If Rock was so incredibly great, we should have hundreds and hundreds of bands that we can rediscover by going through history. But no. We end up with Pink Floyd, Queen, Beatles, Stones, U2, Doors, Hendrix, LedZ, Beach Boys, Aerosmith, \u2014sorry if I missed your favorite\u2014but there aren\u2019t that many. There\u2019s also a huge amount of music being made on Youtube that fits into perhaps a few million hits\u2014and some of those acts get a following. 2c. ",

Some people think that the electric guitar ruined Bob Dylan. There was a time when guitar feedback was considered something to be avoided. When Cher used AutoTune, it was a brilliant creative tool. Some other artists that are perfectly able to sing in key use it as a vocal effect, just like reverb. So, my answer is \"no\" but like anything else, abuse of any technology in pop music leads to a negative connotation. That is more a commentary on pop music than it is on the technology used to create it. ",

If I\u2019m the 70\u2019s you\u2019d reached something like take 18 or 19, you\u2019ll probably play it safe. So no, auto tune is just a tool which makes things a little easier.

            "answer_text": "Not really. Both Autotune and Samplers were designed to be shortcuts to cover up mistakes made by regular bands who, at the time, were accumulating ridiculous debts to recording studios. For a short timeline, the 60\u2019s was an era of restraint. Bands were expected to make albums consisting of basically 3 minute songs that could be released as singles. The 70\u2019s saw the rise of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. Zeppelin never released a single and Pink Floyd made albums that were basically one long song. In short, record labels let bands do whatever they wanted after they saw the success of these two bands. After that people started taking a week to find a comfortable chair while the studios charged thousands per hour. And then they made mistakes, everybody does. So in with samplers, which can loop a repetitive section of a track so the musician doesn\u2019t have to. And Autotune, or it\u2019s predecessors, which could correct bad notes. It doesn\u2019t just work on vocals, it works on any audio. And it\u2019s not all that new a concept. For example, Eric Clapton\u2019s infamous guitar solo on Crossroads is a bunch of different parts of solos from different shows cut and pasted together. He never actually played that solo. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't have an answer for what it means to the music industry, but let me tell you what it has done to aspiring musicians. When I was younger, I wanted to be either an opera soprano or a backup singer for Pink Floyd. After many years of vocal training, I was crestfallen to hear about the use of autotune. Singers are taught to sing with breath and muscle control so they can create music with perfection. It takes years and it takes practice. You must build up muscles you never know you had. It takes a certain breathing technique that makes the tone you put out pure and in tune. So who is making the big bucks now? Cute little girls and sexy young men who have never worked on it, but can rely on technology. So, music industry, enjoy your tech. Singers in training, forget it. You're passe. ",
