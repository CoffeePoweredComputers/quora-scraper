            "answer_text": "In my opinion, as a Taylor Swift fan, Taylor Swift's New Single \"Look What You Made Me Do\" Is the ULTIMATE Example of A/B Testing. People say it\u2019s spiteful, petty, vindictive, dark, or \u201cplaying the victim.\u201d To which I say: Wouldn't it be kind of dumb for Taylor to play anything other than the victim?She's made a FORTUNE and set countless records and won awards by doing that. To quote her Wikipedia page: Swift has received many awards and honors, including 10 Grammy Awards, 19 American Music Awards, 21 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by an act), 11 Country Music Association Awards, 8 Academy of Country Music Awards, one Brit Award, and one Emmy Award. As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. By the beginning of 2016, Swift had sold more than 40 million albums, 130 million single downloads and was one of the top five music artists with the highest worldwide digital sales. Swift's studio albums Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, and 1989 have all sold over 4 million copies in the US. Not to mention, in 2016, \ufeffTaylor made more money than Beyonce, Justin Bieber, and Jay Z combined\ufeff. And she hadn't even released an album since 2014. How did she do it? Other than being an extremely savvy businesswoman, she's demonstrated that she can \"play the victim\" better than anyone else in the world. Read more > But is she actually playing the victim? As I wrote in Taylor Swift's \"Look What You Made Me Do\" Music Video Will Make You Like a Kinda Bad Song... Slightly Better: And though we like to call it \"playing the victim,\" that's an oversimplification. What her songs are really about... is overcoming. She says that Old Taylor is dead.. but how is LWYMMD any different from Blank Space (\"I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams\" vs. \"Darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream), \ufeffShake It Off\ufeff (\"The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama / But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma\" vs. \"My ex-man brought his new girlfriend She's like, \u201cOh my God\u201d, but I'm just gonna shake And to the fella over there with the hella good hair\"), or Mean (\"I don't like your little games, Don't like your tilted stage, The role you made me play, Of the fool, no, I don't like you\" vs. \"You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me, You, have knocked me off my feet again, Got me feeling like a nothing\"). Read more > Musically, though, I didn\u2019t love the song. Or even especially like it. What do you do with it? Sing it? Play it on your guitar? Exercise to it? Listen to it for the complex aural experience? No to all of those. I\u2019d play it at a Halloween party, and that\u2019s about it. The music video, though, does have lots of redeeming qualities. It\u2019s hard not to love the \u201cdead Taylors\u201d:  Especially at the end, when they talk to each other. I haven\u2019t figured out the very obvious Beyonce references, but it\u2019s definitely obvious that she isn\u2019t \u201ccopying\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s doing something else.   ",

            "answer_text": "As a major Taylor Swift fan, I am disappointed. I don\u2019t think the song is terrible, but it\u2019s definitely not what I had been hoping for or anticipating (I don\u2019t mean that in a good way). As much as it pains me to say, I probably won\u2019t be adding this song to a playlist any time soon (which is crazy for me to say about a new Taylor Swift song!). On its own, the song isn\u2019t great. The intro hook is catchy; I dig the lead up. The lyrics in the pre-chorus are intricate and classic TSwift. I love how it starts of slow and separated, and how the tension and anxiety builds in the lead up to the chorus. But then, that \u201cOoh, look what you made me do\u201d comes in, and I just want to hit stop. It feels like someone who\u2019s trying too hard to be cool, which doesn\u2019t fit with my impression of 1989 Taylor Swift, who always seemed to effortlessly look amazing. The phone call towards the end felt out of place and forced, unlike the similarly placed segment in \u201cWe are Never Getting Back Together\u201d. The underlying music is interesting, but the lyrics just don\u2019t fit. Taking a step back from the song itself, it\u2019s clear that this single is trying to set up her upcoming album, Reputation. There\u2019s a lot of speculation that her upcoming album will address the media or be a takedown of how the media covers her or other events. But, as a fan anticipating the first Taylor Swift single in 3 years, I was craving a classic Taylor Swift song that I could jam to and listen to on repeat. In a way, it makes sense that this single has almost nothing in common with her previous work. In the song, she even says that the \u201cold Taylor\u201d is dead. While I can understand how this sets up the album to be angry or a takedown, it\u2019s disappointing to me as a long time fan of Taylor Swift. One of the reasons I was such a huge fan of Taylor Swift\u2019s music was that it felt relatable and genuine. The lyrics spoke to experiences I\u2019d been through or things others were going through. Not all of them were sappy love songs; \u201cMean\u201d was a song that wasn\u2019t a loud over-the-top anthem but still comforted me when I went through something bad in high school (almost more so than louder pop \u201canthems\u201d). Overall, even though I\u2019m not a huge fan of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d as a single, I\u2019m still really looking forward to the upcoming album release. I\u2019m willing to give this new direction and style a chance, but my level of anticipation and hype is definitely not as high as it was a few days ago. ",
