            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve taught elementary school for 22 years. I now teach teachers. I truly remember all of my students, every single one was special and has a place in my heart. But, there was in particular One Student Who Taught Me More His name was See Nou. He was small for a fifth-grader. He was quiet and serious. It took me several months to get to know him as well as I wanted to make learning connections with him. But he was a diligent and intelligent student, self-motivated to learn and do his best work. He was also humble. He needed extra guidance in writing because English was his second language. It seemed to pain him when his grammatical errors needed correcting, so I learned to use a gentle suggestive voice when we worked to edit his writing. I noticed that See Nou had excellent penmanship and that his artwork was beautifully detailed and articulate. But he never showed off his work. He exhibited a quiet internal pride in doing his best. He was an avid reader. We used the Accelerated Reader program for motivating our students. See Nou would read a fifth-grade chapter book each evening and come to school and pass the test on it each morning. This child had so much potential and worked harder than most other students. Although the students had a separate teacher for physical education, I heard the other students praising him on his fast running ability and excellent athletic skills. Again, he shrugged off the complements. It was just who he was. There was a group of tough big boys in that class who could be described as \u201cbully jocks.\u201d Even by 5th grade, they knew they were the best football players at recess and it created a hierarchy of sports leadership that carried into the classroom and affected their relationship with the rest of the students. If you weren\u2019t in the group of five boys in football, you weren\u2019t as powerful, and popular. My youngest son was in my fifth-grade class that year. It was his first year in public school and he had his mom for a teacher \u2013 not a good combination when making new friends. Jacob, my son, was not in the group of jocks. He was with the rest of the boys on the periphery. See Nou was in both groups; he was studious and artsy but he could run the football around the other boys at recess. Most importantly to me, he quietly befriended my son. While the group of tough jocks wouldn\u2019t even talk to Jacob, See Nou included him in conversations and ate lunch with him. The last day of fifth grade was always a \u201cfield day\u201d with races and games. The P.E. teacher had the \u201cbest-of-the-best\u201d run the mile in front of the whole elementary school so they can be cheered on by 600 children. See Nou came in far ahead of anyone else in the mile run. His muscular lean little body had perfect runner rhythm, pace, and posture as he lapped the other racers. Always humble, he accepted his first place medal with a slight nod. See Nou taught me much that year. He taught me about humility and grace. He taught me about true maturity in a child, and how to fit in by being oneself. But I was to learn much more from him. When I returned to school to work in my classroom in the middle of August, the school nurse caught me in the hallway to explain what had taken place with See Nou just a few days earlier. He had fallen off his bike and bruised his arm about a week ago. A couple of days after that, he lost the movement in that arm. Within a few hours he was unconscious and struggling to breath. He was flown to Children\u2019s Hospital in Milwaukee where he was on life support. Doctors thought a blood clot had traveled from his bruised arm to his brain. He was still unconscious in a coma. School began and I had See Nou\u2019s little sister Mai Sing in my fifth-grade class. She was a little sunshine, very similar in nature to her brother. She and I talked daily about See Nou\u2019s progress in the hospital. Mai Sing and my fifth-grade class sent videos and cards to the hospital for him. The school nurse also kept me informed about his progress. In October See Nou regained consciousness. I was told that the family would allow me to visit him in the ICU. At that time I had a phobia about driving in big cities, but I found Milwaukee Children\u2019s Hospital on a map, memorized the freeways I would need to take and drove down on a Saturday afternoon. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. When I finally found my way to his room, his parents and older siblings were gathered as they had been for months now. See Nou\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t speak English, but a high school age sister translated to me that they were happy I was there. See Nou looked at me as I spoke to him. Tears tricked down his cheeks. He couldn\u2019t talk because of the tracheotomy tube in his throat. His chest rose and fell with the whooshing of the machine next to his bed. A month later I did the two-hour drive again to visit See Nou. I took him some new favorite chapter books, drawing pencils and paper, and cards from classmates. When I walked in, he was propped up to a slightly reclined position in bed. The machine was still breathing for him, but they turned it off to show me how his lungs could breath on their own for a few minutes. He was alert. His sister handed him a tablet and pencil. He now used his left hand because his right arm had been affected by the stroke. After speaking to him for several minutes, I asked how he was doing. He drew a wobbly smiley face on his tablet. Then in large shaky letters he wrote: \u201cThank you, Mrs. Henke.\u201d I still have his smile and his note. During the two-hour drive home and years later, I reflected on this child\u2019s life; a family\u2019s life turned upside down. Having a gifted, artistic, athletic child turn into a helpless invalid is difficult to come to terms with. Having that child show a positive attitude and gratefulness for such a small thing as a teacher visiting him for a few minutes boggled my mind. See Nou eventually went home on a portable ventilator and in a wheelchair. The family moved to Madison a year later where they could get more support with his medical care then our small town could provide. Seven years ago, when my son Jacob was a junior in college, I received an email from See Nou\u2019s older sister. She said that See Nou had passed away a few months earlier and her parents wanted me to know how grateful they were for what I had done for him and their family. What I had done? I had done nothing but a couple of short visits to a hospital room, a few cards, words of support and kindness to his little sister at school each day. What See Nou had done for me was profound. That little boy and his family taught me about true love, endurance, persistence, gratitude, and what really matters in life. We can\u2019t know as teachers what sort of difference we make in a child\u2019s life, but for that child and his family, my small gestures of attention meant a lot. How difficult was it for me to give that time and attention? It was a little awkward because of the language barrier. It took a small amount of effort to visit someone who cannot talk. But, teachers all over the world make efforts greater than this every day. They rarely receive thank you notes. I learned from See Nou and his family how important it is to thank others, to have gratitude every day. And, how important it is to care. ",

            "answer_text": "I had a student, Roger, when I taught eighth grade English in rural Maine. He was a bit on the weasly side, as are many eighth graders. He didn\u2019t like to read. He avoided writing. Tried to avoid work as much as possible and was a bit of a trouble maker. Kind of a pain in the ass, frankly. Two years later I had his sister, Crystal. She was everything her brother wasn\u2019t. She worked hard, loved to read. For a unit on teaching something to the class, she asked for and got permission to bring her horse to school. She was there, in the parking lot, with her riding helmet and whip, with the rope attached to the horse, all four feet of her, making that horse canter, trot, and do all sorts of different walks. Kids spent their lunch hour watching Crystal put that horse literally through its paces. Then in March, a teacher pulled me over. \u201cDid you hear? Roger was in a bike accident. Came tearing down a hill and crashed into a car - driven by a teacher, would you believe? Landed in a ditch. Crystal found him. Not a mark on him but just making these little mewing sounds, all curled up.\u201d It was the worst thing. I tore over to the community hospital after school. Crystal was there, in the waiting room. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t wear a helmet,\u201d she said. \u201cSame thing happened to my other brother. He\u2019s in a home in Portland. Can\u2019t speak. Never really recovered.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cYour other brother was in a car-bike accident, too?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d She told me how Roger had changed over the past two years, how he had been the most amazing big brother. Crystal, so great in class, wasn\u2019t getting along with her mother - what eighth grade girl does? but her brother ran interference between them, getting them to make peace, over and over again. This Roger, the boy whose picture I have, wearing a tye dyed shirt, all zits and attitude, had grown up when I wasn\u2019t looking, and now lay motionless, on life support. I hadn\u2019t known what he\u2019d become, how he\u2019d evolved. What I had missed. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer your question with a story: I was a 9th grade English teacher, teaching an honors gifted and talented class at a school with a very odd population. Our school was in a \u201cdifficult\u201d part of town with a large population of immigrants with English as their second language and lower socio-economic, working class people with a lot on their plate. The other half of our school was higher socio-economic gifted and talented suburban students bused in from around the district to be a part of the gifted/talented magnet program we housed. We were bringing together two very different worlds. As part of this program, we had three levels of core classes: Advanced (Gifted), Honors, and Standard levels. While students have to test into this program in elementary school, when they hit the middle school, it became self-select. One year I had a student named Alex who wanted to get into my Advanced class. He had just graduated out of the special education reading program and read at a third-grade level. When the vice principal asked if I would recommend him for my Advanced course, I promptly said that it wouldn\u2019t work. The students in the class were well above grade level in reading and we moved quickly and in depth in all subjects, as I was working to prepare them for AP/IB courses when they moved to the high school in 10th grade. They discussed this with Alex, but he wasn\u2019t deterred. He harassed the vice principal all summer until they let him register. I was pretty wary. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to be able to give him the support he would need to keep up. His writing was incomplete and low level, but the vice principal and counselors said that if he wants to try, then grades be damned, he could try. I\u2019d like to say that he was successful, but wasn\u2019t. He quickly found that it was a bit too fast for him, but he tried hard and I helped him as much as I could. Mid first quarter, we discussed his placement and he moved down to my honors course, which was at a slower pace and where I could give him a lot more support. Of course, at that point, he admitted that the reason he wanted to be in the Advanced course was because he had a crush on a girl in my class and wanted to impress her. He was also at a point in his life where he had previously been teetering on the edge of trouble and gang affiliation but wanted to make a change by surrounding himself with more motivated kids and a better environment. Alex didn\u2019t ace the year, but his growth in my honors course was extensive. I got to know him and learned that he had five younger siblings, all from different dads and that his dad had been abusive, but then left. His mom was loving and working hard to help him succeed and had a dream of him being the first in his family to graduate. He was a father figure to his younger siblings and got a job as soon as he could to help provide for the family. He decided he wanted to be a police officer and help people, especially families that were victims of domestic violence. He had a goal of going to college and majoring in forensics and getting a Master\u2019s degree. Based on his determination, I didn\u2019t doubt he could do it. After another year I moved up to the high school. Alex found me as a junior and would always stop in to say hi. He came in to let me know how things were going. He would come in and ask for help on his essays for the honors English classes he was taking. He graduated with honors and got into college. He gave me a before he graduated, thanking me for helping him along his path. It was in complete sentences with correct spelling: It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I\u2019ve had other students like Alex of varying levels of education from AP students to ESL students. To answer your question through this story, what I remember are the students who care and who take advantage of the opportunities they have, no matter how good or bad their circumstances. They don\u2019t blame or make excuses or let others fight their battles. They try! It\u2019s an amazing thing to be a part of. ",

I have had students who were keenly interested in learning, those who were just fulfilling the language requirement, and some that tried my patience on a daily basis. I know it sounds corny, but i love them as if they were my own children. I often wonder how life has treated them. I mourn the ones that drop out of school, and the future they have given themselves. I delight in seeing them with families of their own. I love reading in the newspaper about some achievement they have attained. Occasionally, one will visit from college and we have a nice conversation. Some have brought their children to show me. So to answer your question, I remember them all. I\u2019m terrible with names, but I can tell you a lot about each one. They have all left a lasting impression on me, and I hope they are all doing well. I have been truly blessed to have known them.
