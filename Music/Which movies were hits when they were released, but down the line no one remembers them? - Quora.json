            "answer_text": "My answer comes not from the perspective of someone in the industry or a film critic, but rather from someone who just watches a decent amount of movies.  So my answers are subjective to whatever I've heard/read about. Anyway, here are a few that come to mind. Juno (2007):  Not that people don't still remember it, but it seemed like it was huge (e.g. it was nominated for Best Picture) when it came out, and now people barely mention it.  Contrast that with Superbad, which was from the same year, and which people still seem to talk about. Crash (2004):  There were a bunch of people who didn't like it when it came out, but it seems like, as time has gone by, this film has become less well-liked and talked about.  Contrast that with Brokeback Mountain, which continues to be talked about years later (although it's not hard to figure out why...). Here's a chart of all-time inflation-adjusted domestic box office (although they have worldwide and unadjusted on the site, too): http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm  I've heard of the Sting, but not as much as I've heard of the other movies in the top 20.  Beverly Hills Cop is still on Comedy Central occasionally, but no one talks about it (other than to say that Eddie Murphy used to be better).  I had thought American Graffiti was a cult hit, and not a big box office draw.  I don't hear too many people talking about the Towering Inferno, the Poseidon Adventure, Tootsie, or Twister anymore.  I've only heard of House of Wax because the Paris Hilton remake was so terrible.  I've never even heard of Sergeant York. Also, all of the movies mentioned by Keith Calder are prominent on Box Office Mojo's list. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm kind of shocked by the examples you give. People are definitely still talking about SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, and TITANIC was just re-released this year in 3D and grossed another $342 million worldwide. To put that in perspective, TITANIC 3D (a re-release of a movie made 15 years ago) is the 5th highest grossing film so far in 2012. But here are some past big hit films that seem to be under-represented in modern film conversations\u2026 The Ten Commandments (1956)This film still gets some mentions these days, mostly for the scope of the production. But when you consider that adjusted for inflation it's the 6th highest grossing film of all time, I would consider it to have greatly dipped in popularity from its original release. Doctor Zhivago (1965)This epic was David Lean's biggest his, clocking in at #8 on the inflation-adjusted all-time highest grossing films list. It won five Academy Awards. However, despite it having more initial commercial success, it doesn't hold the same modern attention as some of Lean's other films such as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA or THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Love Story (1970)This film was a huge phenomenon when it was released in 1970, and is one of the highest grossing low-budget films of all time. It seems to have almost no relevance in modern film conversations, from what I can tell. Airport (1970)This disaster movie was a huge hit, launching a set of sequels and more interestingly the spoof film AIRPLANE! Of course, the spoof film is remembered much more fondly and more vividly than the original hit. The Robe (1953)A big hit for Fox, this film is #45 on the list of biggest hits adjusted for inflation. And it's the first film on the list that I knew nothing about. Surely that says something. ",
