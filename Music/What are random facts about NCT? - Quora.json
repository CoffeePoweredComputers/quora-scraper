            "answer_text": "these facts are mostly about 127, as they are the unit i follow the most :') i wrote these down before jungwoo was added into the group, so there aren't any for him unfortunately :( - Yuta said that the member he is closest to is Taeyong, because Taeyong gives him the most advice and is very dependable. He also notices when Yuta is upset right away. - The other members compare Doyoung to a rabbit / bunny because they think he looks like one, and it's one of his nicknames. They've been calling him this since they were rookies. - Tayeong finds that cleaning calms him down. - Taeyong says that Johnny looks like a camel, but Johnny thinks that he looks more like a cat. - One of Yuta's nicknames is 'Mountain Man' because Osaka has a lot of mountains. - Mark is often compared to a lion cub and called 'Simba' by fans. - Yuta sleeps the earliest of all the members. - Winwin's favourite body part is (are?) his ears, because one of them is pointy and the other is curved. He jokes that he's half-elf. - Johnny is most confident in his lips because their curves make him look like he's always smiling a little. - Yuta likes his fingers/hands because they're thin and dainty for playing the piano. - Haechan said that the body part he is most proud of his is skin tone, because it makes him stand out. - Taeil said that the body part he is most proud of is his tummy (abdomen?) not because of a six pack, but because the skin there is really soft. :') - Jaehyun has Taeyong saved in his phone as \"Ttiyoungie Hyung\" and Taeil saved as \"Ill Hyung.\" - Mark gave Taeil the English name \"Billy\" because Taeil's name sounds like William :') - Johnny's favourite place in Chicago is Navy Pier because he has a lot of childhood memories there and he likes going to see the fourth of July fireworks. - The other members voted Doyoung as the \"eldest hyung\" if they were to ignore actual age. - Jaehyun went by \"Jay\" when he lived in the United States (Connecticut, to be specific!), and one of his nicknames was Jay Jay the Jet plane, though he hates the nickname and asked fans not to use it. - Yuta and Taeyong both have helix piercings. - Johnny likes to drink coffee. - Taeil is the first ranking in FIFA among NCT. - At first, Johnny didn't like his Korean name (Youngho) because it was a common name in books and he didn't think that it was special, but he now likes it because of the meaning (Young = shine + Ho = sunny/clear) and he thinks it fits him really well. - Jaehyun loves musical movies. - Taeyong, Yuta and Mark are ticklish. - Doyoung uses twitter the most out of all the members. - Taeil keeps a four leaf clover in his wallet with him wherever he goes. He said it was given it by an old lady on the bus (I think?? I'm not 100% sure about the second part, but he definitely carries his clover with him everywhere.) - Mark has a red booklet that he carries with him most of the time to write lyrics in. (It was also a gift but I can't remember who from!) - Even though Johnny also reads a lot, the other members say that Winwin reads the most, since he's always reading books on the plane. - At first, Johnny had difficulty keeping up with the other members during dance practices, so he had to lift weights to keep up with them. - Winwin's favourite Korean food is Samgyetang (Ginseng Chicken Soup). - Mark likes banana milk. - Doyoung is easily scared during horror movies. (Johnny says that it's stressful to sit next to him.) - Yuta really likes gaming and carries a nintendo console with him a lot, and one of the first things he does in the morning is play games. ",

            "answer_text": "taeyong has a scar on his stomach which looks to be from an appendectomy. he also has a scar by his eyepeople used to think xiaojun\u2019s dad was a drag queen, but really he only dressed up as a women for one particular performance.yangyang is taiwanese by ethnicity, not specifically chinese. a lot of people think he was born in germany, which is also false. he moved from taiwan to germany when he was about 11, i believe.every wayv member is multilingual. kun speaks mandarin, korean, and has been studying english extensively recently. ten is fluent in korean, thai, english, and mandarin, and studies japanese. winwin speaks mandarin, wenzhounese, a chinese dialect known as \u201cdevil\u2019s language\u201d for its complexity, korean, and is learning english from ten. lucas speaks cantonese as his native language, mandarin, basic english, a good amount of korean (i think he understands better than he speaks), and a little bit of thai. xiaojun speaks mandarin, cantonese, korean, and english, and hendery speaks mandarin, cantonese, english, and korean. lastly, yangyang speaks mandarin, german, english, korean, and said he is learning some spanish. out of every language that nct collectively speaks, wayv can speak all of them but japanese fluently.ten used to be popular in thailand before he became an sm trainee. he went by the name \u201ctnt\u201djaehyun can reach the highest notes in nct (127). he doesn\u2019t sing with them, but he can reach whistle notes.jaehyun is also one of nct\u2019s only baritones, along with winwin, lucas, and (possibly?) jisung.doyoung MCed 2017/2018 inkigayo, 2016 Mnet countdown, and probably more that i forgot about \ud83d\ude33only 3 out of 7 wayv members were actually born in (mainland) china: kun, winwin, and xiaojun. ten is from thailand, but if chinese descent, lucas is from hong kong, but half thai, hendery is from macau, a now chinese region, but previously portuguese territory, and yangyang was born in (as previously stated) taiwan, but lived in germany for a while.nct is rumored to debut a new unit this year (2020) consisting of jaemin, jeno, jisung, and some new members. nct is also rumored to be debuting an nct-indonesia soon with lucas, ten, and more new members.taeil had to choose between university and becoming an sm trainee, and he (obviously) chose to become a singerlots johnny\u2019s old friends from chicago only recently (in the last year i believe) found out that he\u2019s become famous in korea and internationally. they said that he told them he was going to become a model in korea when he was accepted as a trainee. they also made comments about how he was in choir and that he was always sleeping in class.mark used to play flute in elementary and middle school. i believe doyoung also used to play flute.yuta was training to be a soccer player before he auditioned for smto end this on a high note: JUNGWOO HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED TO RETURN FOR NCT127\u2019S COMEBACK!!!!edit: i got more haha taeil chews with his mouth openhaechan likes spicy thingsalso, taeil said haechan showed him how to enjoy life more and have more fundoyoung has a scar by his lip jaehyun set an all time record for bowling at ISAC with a score of 143johnny\u2019s height is still the biggest mystery in all of ncityhendery and lucas are the \u201cwong brothers\u201d (wong is the cantonese form of huang and they\u2019re both native canto speakers)ten has openly expressed his support of the lgbt+ community!kun does a lot of composing, arranging, and producing (whether for solo projects or for other wayv members)mark is christian and gave haechan a bible for his 18th birthday. he also says he keeps nctzens in his prayersa fan asked taeil what is vocal range is and he said \u201ci can sing pretty much everything\u201d and i quite like those words a lot \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0dmark and jaehyun did an interview with korean englishman (jolly). important

said recently that he wants to start working out to stay in better shape since a video came out and showed his stomach a bit and he didn\u2019t like it :(dj johnnylucas kept singing \u201ckung fu fighting\u201d in dream plan so much that it got copyrighted on youtubeten attended a british school in thailand, but continued to learn more english (skills) from johnny/mark in nct, so he has a bit of a strange accenti noticed recently that even though yuta isn\u2019t that tall/big, there aren\u2019t many photos of him looking tinyyangyang wants to name his son \u201celeven\u201d because he\u2019ll be better than tenwayv has two cats (louis and leon) and a dog (bella) *pardon the bad handwriting i just wrote in on my phone quickly  renjun hosts a live radio show EVERY DAY at 9pm kst,

do this weird push up thing where he starts on the ground, stomach side down, with his legs and arms stretched out, then pushes up and i can\u2019t explain it well but whateverten\u2019s dance

about who he hangs out with, or talks to a lot, or who his best friend is (in video calls), he always says johnny which is super sweet \ud83e\udd7ataeil recorded the high note in kick it first try10th

pic.twitter.com/8SN6SqaQtM\u2014 \u3141\u3134 (@jaemintography) January 27, 2020\n chenle is mostly classically trained with his vocals, which explains how he has such amazing breath control and stability compared to other members without that formal training (who only trained with sm)chenle\u2019s also a child prodigy and piano-masteryuta reads fan fiction6/7 wayv members have a personal instagram, so now wayv\u2019s official page is \u201cwinstagram\u201d until winwin finally gets his own account (which he said he applied for)edit: winstagram is officially open! username wwiinn_7yuta, jaehyun, and johnny also have personal instagram accountsjaehyun is an inkigayo mc with monsta x\u2019s minhyuk and april\u2019s naeundoyoung used to be an inkigayo mc with got7\u2019s

clarified it was about a COMPUTER GAME real quickdoyoung is always making weird faces in vlive saying \u201cscreenshot this for a meme\u201d (recent example) jaehyun and haechan don\u2019t believe in ghostsrenjun REALLY believes in ghosts, as well as aliens (jaehyun does believe in aliens)lucas started an instagram live because wayv got stuck in an elevator and there was a \u201cmonster\u201d outsidehe had another live where he got the wayv members together and they threw a shoe in the air to try and hit each other\u2019s heads. even kun joinedten, renjun, taeyong, and yuta especially draw a lot (but i\u2019m sure other members do too)(yuta)    (ten)   (taeyong)    (renjun)   recently ncity broke because doyoung tweeted photos captioned \u201c\ud83d\udcf8\ub7f0\uc954 (renjun)\u201d but he was wearing the same clothes as in an earlier photo he said was taken by his mom, so everyone was saying they adopted renjun \ud83d\ude02jaemin was on a hiatus from pretty much all of 2017 for a back issue (herniated disk) so he missed two comebacks; mfal & we youngnct 127 and nct dream both released live albumsnct dream still hasn\u2019t gotten a full length album, wtf smrenjun and chenle have a self-written and composed song called \u201ca new beginning\u201d which they made in order to graduate from beijing contemporary music school (in may 2020 i believe) and they were top students!nct 127\u2019s emojis are:\ud83c\udf19 taeil\ud83d\udc3b johnny\ud83c\udf39 taeyong\ud83d\udc19/\ud83c\udf52 yuta\ud83d\udc30 doyoung\ud83c\udf51/\ud83c\udf5e jaehyun\ud83d\udc25(?)

well\u201d127\u2019s maknae line is jungwoo, mark, haechan, and taeil (the \u201904 liner)also called the \u201cmoonmoons\u201d because they\u2019re taeil\u2019s biggest fansjungwoo called yuta his son because he spills things on himself and doesn\u2019t tidy up127 haven\u2019t ever gone on a trip together without cameras, they\u2019ve only traveled for work :(taeyong decorated a bag for haechan onceyuta like hard rock music and concepttaeil LOVES edm music and hip hop because he can \u201cfeel his heart thumping\u201ddoyoung called \u201cdreams come true\u201d his ultimate favorite song (from them) but idk if he was just referring to that album or for their whole discographyyuta and johnny both said \u201clove song\u201d is their favorite nct b-sidemark said \u201cnot alone\u201d wasn\u2019t a song he naturally gravitated towards, but it really hit him hard when he listened to the final chorus and it grew on himtaeil likes \u201canother world\u201d a lot which makes me superrrrr happy because he absolutely bodied that song and it\u2019s one of my favorites to this day. he said he wanted to perform in in neo city tour but he was upset he didn\u2019t get a chance to and wants to still perform it live somedayi always find it really cute when taeil is trying to explain something cause the other members just have this nervous energy about what he\u2019s trying to say and he doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense but he\u2019s DEAD serious and it\u2019s adorabletaeyong has tattoos under each elbow that say \u201cunder\u201d and \u201cstand,\u201d as well as a cute little drawing of his dog ruby on his inner elbow area, and an alien/ufo drawing on his other inner elbow    johnny has a tattoo of a sunflower on his forearm, and an unconfirmed tattoo on his shoulder (as in we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real)   ten has a forearm tattoo as well as a chest tattoo that covers a scar  lucas has a tattoo on his torso in a recent interview taeyong was talking about being a leader and how sometimes with the foreign members, even though they\u2019re fluent in korean they may have difficulty understanding harder words so he will often keep reexplaining and trying to translate things in different ways to help them out (yuta was mentioned specifically)taeil and jungwoo like to \u201ccompete\u201d with word play/puns often. they said taeil wins, and johnny added that jungwoo purposefully loses for taeil but taeil said jungwoo tries really hard but he still loses and comes back to start a new competition. but the final verdict is \u201ctaeil always wins\u201dmark sleep talks in english and korean, and doyoung sleep talks too (in just korean) but doesn\u2019t mumble\u2014 he clearly speaks (according to taeyong)127 though their dorm/one room was haunted because taeil would sleep walk and bang his head on the door, but they moved dorms now so it\u2019s not their problemyuta can\u2019t handle spicy foodtaeyong played violin when he was a kidtaeyong really likes the beach/sea, called it his favorite place and has it as his phone backgroundtaeyong has (a) pet fish in the dormtaeyong also recently said he felt stressed so he bought a new fish tank and is thinking of what type of fish to put in ittaeil has a scar on his cheek  mark apparently wasn\u2019t aware that there were international fans on lysn bubbleshotaro had a popular tiktok where he danced (and is REALLY good), and there were rumors saying he only trained for a few months because he was casted with his tiktok dance for \u201ckick it\u201dbut yangyang said he trained with shotaro so that couldn\u2019t have been the case because kick it wasn\u2019t released when yangyang was still a traineesungchan is like really tall. like probably taller than jisungnct 2020 album will have a pt 2 in novembersungchan likes soccershotaro is japanese so now yuta has a japanese friend!jeno is allergic to cats, be he still has three of them! bongshik, nal, and seol ten has had a lot of dogs throughout his life, at least 5 within his family (but now he has another dog with wayv \u263a\ufe0f)yuta also has a dog named rapunzel. i think she\u2019s a toy poodle taeyong had a dog named ruby who had been with him for a very long time, but in early september of this year, she passed away :( he was so upset over her death that he almost thought of removing it, but he\u2019s healed well now and loves the tattoo even more taeil is the official leader of the vocal linewinwin is the leader of one of nct u\u2019s new units, but he said he didn\u2019t want to be and was forced into that position hahataeil said he doesn\u2019t like to do cover songs because he wants to release his own music, but sm is a butt and won\u2019t even give him an sm station \ud83d\ude12with that being said, taeil often goes to his friend (yuhwa)\u2019s house/studio to work on making his own musictaeil also said he wants to sing in a musical, do rnb or pop songs, and that he wants to do variety shows that makes you use your body (like running man)kun has a bachelor\u2019s degree from beijing school of contemporary musicchenle and renjun also graduated from beijing
