            "answer_text": "Summary I would say that therapy mode refers to the relationship between the therapist and client, whereas therapy modality refers to the model used by the therapeutic theory to account for behavior and to suggest what is effective in changing behavior. Method In order to develop this understanding, I did a quick google search to look up various modes and modalities of therapy. You can see the lists I generated below. This is a non-generalizable sample of the use of the terms, so anyone who wants to see whether this difference is replicated by other users of the terminology should collect more examples of how the terms are used. Analysis Therapy mode seems to describe the relationship between therapist and client. Is it a one to one relationship or one to many relationship (e.g., individual vs group therapy). Does the relationship take place in an office, a room, or on the phone or over the internet (e.g., the site of the therapy). Which discipline within the fields of psychiatry and psychology does the the therapist identify with (e.g., social work vs psychiatry or marital vs school therapy)? Therapy modality refers to the specific model used to understand how the mind responds to circumstance or relates to other humans. Here we find specific types of therapy such as CBT, DBT, analysis, Jungian therapy, existential therapy and so on. There are many more modalities for therapy, but all the modalities can fit into various different modes of therapy. Modality depends on the theoretical understanding of human behavior and the role that emotions play in motivating behavior. Modality also depends on the theory about the cause of psychological problems, which also determines how these problems are treated.

            "answer_text": "Before I answer this question, I think we need to find out treatment modality is. A modality is the way or mode in which something exists or is done. You might often see it used with reference to diagnostic modality, which is the way in which a disease or illness is diagnosed by a doctor. Modality shares its root with the word mode, meaning \"the way in which something happens or is experienced.\" Treatment modality is simply the method used to treat a patient for a particular condition. In the vernacular, you may also hear both patients and medical professionals use \"approach\" or \"type\" and other such descriptions. Treatment Mode means the mode of treatment. The primary modes of therapy offered typically include individual, couples, family, and group therapy. ",
