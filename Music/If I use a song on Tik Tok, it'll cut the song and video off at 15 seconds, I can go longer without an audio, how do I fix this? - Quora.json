            "answer_text": "Tik Tok has a special license with music providers that only allows them to play a 15 second clip. They cannot legally allow more music than that or they are engaging in copyright infringement and their app will be sued into oblivion under a massive wave of lawsuits. Further, they really want to be about short videos. This is a boundary they are trying to hold you to: 15 second videos. They do let you go to a full 60 seconds, but not with music. The whole name implies videos that are only a few seconds like, \u201ctik tok\u201d is the sound of a stopwatch ticking. If you want to do something other than what they allow, you need to be posting on YouTube or Facebook or Vimeo or something; because Tik Tok doesn\u2019t allow that. ",

Before I tell you how to do it, TikTok favors shorter 15 second videos and so do viewers. It\u2019s not about licencing as people suggested, TikTok is a China based company that doesn\u2019t abide by the same copyright laws as other countries do. Here\u2019s how to do a 60 second video with music for the entire video.
