            "answer_text": "Sadly, HM was never fortunate enough to meet Freddie. Of course, Freddie would have been the one excited and honored as he was obviously fond of the Monarchy. (There are photoshopped pictures on the i-net of the Queen and Freddie together and there is a picture of the band with a Queen imitator.) Update: As an American I made a terrible mistake using the label \u201cHRH\u201d originally but changed it to the propah HM for \u201cHer Majesty\u201d. I just hope Freddie can forgive me. Thanks to commenter for the subtle hint.) HM was fortunate enough to meet two of Queen\u2019s other band members. Here is a video of her meeting Brian May along with Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck. You may notice a \u201cCBE\u201d after Brian\u2019s name in print. It is a royal honor called the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. It is a British order of chivalry, rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences, work with charitable and welfare organizations, and public service outside the civil service. I guess this means he\u2019ll never achieve the title of Sir. The video is difficult to understand but he apologizes to the Queen for making all that racket from atop Buckingham Palace. She does not seem to know or recognize any of these greats. So unworthy! Lol.  But Brian was outdone by Roger who was presented to the Queen within a week of his birth. He was one of the first babies born in a brand new hospital in King\u2019s Lynn and met the Queen when she formally opened the hospital. I read about it in \u201cQueen in Cornwall\u201d but here is an article also telling about it. Queen drummer Roger Taylor remembers his childhood in King's Lynn Winifred was the first mother in the ward that the Queen spoke to and \u201cshe chatted to Mrs. Taylor about her new son, and his name.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah but the story ain't pretty. Originally the band we all know now as Queen was actually Her Majesty and just Brian. One day Freddy came along and did some backing vocals. Her Majesty put up with Freddy's Harrow school boy ways for as long as she could, but it all came to a boil one fateful day after Easter Sunday, actually that would be Easter Monday\u2026. Now where was I\u2026. Oh yeah, Her Majesty the Queen had just been on the town with Bri' and got back and had a shower and went about the house lookin' for her nighty. Right that minute she followed a trail of Smarties \u2014 yeah Freddy liked Smarties and was always gulping 'em down and used to lose a few here an' there, bad habit it was\u2026. Anyway she followed the trail all the way down to the basement and there he was! Wearing her silkies. She was like, \u201cYou batcunter Freddy; that nighties been reserved for us blue blooded broads for the past 600 bleedin years! I'm the only fackin Queen around here!\u201d She stormed out slappin' his smarties at him, and on reaching the door she kicked a can of Irn Bru which hit him right in the balls. While Freddy naturally discovered a few more high notes, Her Majesty was already climbing out onto her helipad; flying out on a career in Rock\u2019n\u2019roll right there and then. So now you know.

            "answer_text": "No. Not as a band. unfortunately Freddie had been deceased 23 years before HM recognized his birthday and the fact that perhaps Freddie should have been knighted. I have no idea about John Deacon. Roger Taylor met HM at 2 weeks of age I believe when she toured the hospital his mother Winifred was in. On 12.31.19, Roger was also awarded OBE ( Officer of the Order of the British Empire ) Brian May was awarded the title of CBE (Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire ) in 2005. He also honored HM Golden Jubilee in 2002 by performing God Save the Queen on the roof of Buckingham Palace . That\u2019s a really cool video to watch. These are the only times I am aware of. I should research this more as it\u2019s interesting. All those years in the 70s and 80s that Queen was rocking at Wembley and other places, I would think there would be more instances. I do know that Brian May and Roger Taylor sat behind Princess Diana and Prince Charles at Live Aid. And Brian has done work with Prince Charles he has shared on his IG page. Good question! ",

            "answer_text": "She met Brian May, after he played \u201cGod Save The Queen\u201d on the roof of Buckingham Palace as part of the celebrations for the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2013. The rest of Queen met other members of the royal family at various times over the years such as at Live Aid in 1985: Charles and Diana, at Princes Trust gigs and indeed Freddie even went out for a night in the 80\u2019s at a gay pub with Diana in disguise for a laugh accompanied by some of his friends if we are to believe. But I cannot know whether the members of Queen knew the royal family in private, or were invited to any of their private functions, played for them etc., or were part of their society social circle at one time as Elton John was well known for, for example. Freddie was apparently a royalist and he once said in 1977: \u201c Im a royalist and I like all the pomp of this jubilee, the Queen- she does outrageous things too\u201d so he probably wouldn\u2019t have turned them down for sure!
