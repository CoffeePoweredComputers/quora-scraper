            "answer_text": "Boss always did quite useful MultiFX Processors with a descent, maybe not too detailed sound, but they always work very well and sound musical.The newer models also incorporate Modeling amps which are really nice :) My approach to get a modeling amp thingy was different. I came from real tube amps including a Mesa Boogie MK III and a MK IV Rackhead and was searching for that exact sound(s) and versatility, while getting some more amps I never owned but liked as an add on. This lead me to the Axe FX II, now called Axe FX II Mark II or XL (depends on how conplex the setup should be). This Box is the by far best modeling of any Amps I ever heard, as it truly reproduces the full richness of all the valve amps it can simulate, going from old school Fenders through a big range of Marshalls, Oranges several ones I never heard of up to my beloved Boogies. They feel right like real valve amps, with all their dynamic reaction to your guitar and your playing, just it does not weigh hundreds of kg you gotta carry around ;)Also it adds a big bunch of very high class (best in my opinion) FX through everything you might ever need. At the expense of no detail loss like when you put a cry baby in front of your amp and the sound degrades because of additional cables and not perfect throughput of the original guitar signal. Even though newer fx are better at this point. On the downside is the price. This is the top of the notch device existing and so is the price. On the other hand you can not get a single valve preamp for that price - depends on the budget and your needs. I also used some Line6es and was never satisfied with them, as they sounded still a bit plastic to me. This went up to the XT Floorboard some years ago.Though I must say I liked the Line6 bass amps :) I would personally audition the available devices at your local store, and see which fits your needs and budget most. If money is not the matter go for the Axe FX. So much pros are using it for a good reason. (I am none of these, I just love the sound) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. For several years i was seeking a solution for this exact problem. I was in the never ending seek of tone in a compact package easy to carry, easy to set up, affordable and great sounding. I need something ready to set up on a live setting, and this same thing needs to be great sounding to be useful for my little recording studio. I dismiss the obvious solutions for the following reasons: Proven and true amp sims like Kemper profile and Axe Fx: -They are too expensive for me now. -There is no much people around in my country working with these. - I can\u2019t really try them before buying because they aren\u2019t ordinary sold on my country or at least on my city. So its a great risk invest too much money on them. - The shipping cost to my country makes them even more unaffordable. -I really don\u2019t need too many options, i just wanted a mesa like distorted tone and a nice clean.  It this too much to ask? So i kept looking\u2026 -I try the obvious more affordable choices like a POD X3 and a Behringer GI21. They are nice but aren\u2019t just there yet. And for me the POD things are overcomplicated pieces to work with. I need something with just a clean and a distorted good sounding tone not a trillions of amp models with a few somewhat-decent sims, so i kept searching. In fact i found the behringer even more useful later because it can be used as an active direct box when needed with an XLR output. So i kept looking\u2026  Just too many options, i am not a tweaker guy. After reading a zillion online forums and debates the consensus was the tone is in the valve-guitar amp. The obvious choice was a tube guitar amp, but it can\u2019t resolve my problem because: -They are too f*ing loud. -They are too f*ing expensive. -They are too f*ing heavy - large - inconvenient. -They need regular maintenance, if something fails it becomes a chore to get a replacement. I live in a third world country so getting access to a new valve or tube can take several days or even weeks, its not like going to \u201cguitar store\u201d and pick one. These aren\u2019t widely available in my country, let alone specific brands. -Did i mention they are too loud? However i did give the amp solution one more chance by purchasing a 5w valve amp. I needed something to fit into my little home studio, and after some research i get a 5w valve amp in hopes it will resolve my problem. In my country there are no such thing as guitar center so i couldn\u2019t try the amp with my equipment before buying it, i just order it to a local dealer and hope for the best. I get this little fellow:  Its a Blackstar HT5. It is awesome, great sounding piece of equipment, it even has an emulated output to work with it silently. But\u2026 nothing its perfect. The emulated output wasn\u2019t that good for pro-recording, it doesn\u2019t have enough gain on its own so i need to push it with an Overdrive on the front, an EQ on the loop, or a distortion pedal on the clean channel (This by the way defeats the purpose having a valve-amp for heavy metal in the first place). And even when i did manage to get a great tone; It was too fucking loud! Really 5w on a valve amp is too much for a little recording studio but it is too little for band practice. Its like a no man\u2019s land. And sadly it was too loud for my practice place but not powerful enough to move the amount of air needed to get a strong nice miced tone. So i kept looking\u2026 Before i continue, a final word about guitar amps: I hate them, i always have and always will. I think i am one of the few (if not the only) guitar players in the world who hates guitar amps. -I have played for years with big amps on live settingsand studio settings and i am done with it\u2026 Really\u2026 I just can\u2019t take it no more. There is no way you can get everybody happy with these monsters on a little stage. They are always too loud for stage, uncontrolable beasts, and often brings too many problems with the monitoring. The sound guy is not happy, and you are always willing to sacrifice tone for volume or viceversa unless you are playing on a big gig. But it doesn\u2019t happen too often. The worse thing is that you can\u2019t know for sure if the sound you get from the amp is the same the audience get from the PA. The consistency from gig to gig is nonexistent. Most of the time its small places and nothing would be easier than going straight to the mixer and get in ear monitoring\u2026 You hear the same through monitoring than the audience through the PA. Everybody would be happy. So i kept looking\u2026 I did stumble almost by error with software amp sims and impulses. They are great, I currently work with them all the time. After try several free and paid amp sims the ones i liked most are the free ones: Lepou Legion and Lepou Lecto. They are just too good. Paired with some good cabinet impulses and you are ready to go.  So while seeking for a live playing solution i finally resolve my studio problem. Great! But unfortunatelly, my live playing problem still was unresolve. I just can\u2019t bring my PC, the interface, the wiring, to some bar for some gig, period. So i kept looking\u2026 Wow.. this answer is getting longer than i expected but i save the best for last. After another countless hours on the internet in hopes to solve my problem i decided to order one of this:  This little thing emulates a Peavey 5150 I couldn\u2019t be happier. Its a liitle guitar preamp in pedal format. Just do one thing but does it very well. You can use it in the loop of an amp, a power amp or straight into a mixer, you get only one tone but is very f*ing good. So i was so happy. After a few months i decided to order another one as a backup with a different voice:  This one emulates a Mesa Rec Channel. I am very, very pleased. My entire live rig is now only a guitar case and a bag with my tiny pealboard (Just an overdrive, an Eq pedal, a wah and the AMT). Most of the time my job is just get there, plug and play. That simple. Now I can get a consistent great tone gig after gig after gig. And practice with headphones with no hassles when im home. My amp-solution now fits in my pedalboard and i can be pretty sure the tone i hear through monitoring is the same the audience hears. It has an internal cab sim, which i use when going straight to the mixer, but you can get even better results when paired the AMT preamp pedal with a cab simulator like the AMT chameleon or the Moer Trescab for recording. You can\u2019t go wrong with an AMT legend series. Just make sure to order the one that fits more to the sound you are after. Beware; they aren\u2019t versatile. They are a one trick pony, but a great one. They all sound different. Make sure to listen online before buying to know which one to order. I hope you find my anwer usefull in some way. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not exactly an amp modeller but I would recommend the flyrig5:  It is a very versatile and can be used with and amp, straight to the PA, or into an audio interface for recording. It's not digital so it doesn't get some of the weird noises you tend to get with digital amp modelers, though it can get noisy when everything is on. Overall it sounds great. I recently played in a concert and had to travel out of state. I couldn't afford to take an amp with me so I took this and plugged it into the mixer. I did not miss my amp. It also plays nice with pedals (for the most part). I've also used it to record songs and I'm happy with how they turned out. It doesn't have 2 inputs but usually you record guitar mono unless you have some kind of stereo effect. ",

            "answer_text": "Not strictly a modeler, but the Kemper Profiling Amp is amazing.  It works by taking a particular real-world amp/speaker/mic combo, dialed in to your liking, and sampling its response.  From that, when presented with your guitar input, it generates the output that particular rig would have. You can profile your own amps, but the real value is the vast array of already-tweaked-and-perfected rigs available for download. I have a profile of a Fender Twin dimed, with a tubescreamer in front of it, and the only difference between me and Stevie Ray Vaughan is the glaring lack of talent.  Then there's the Bogner Ecstasy profile, and the 5150, and the Mesa Dual Rectifier, all dialed in and consistently repeatable. The Axe-FX is awesome as well.  Either one is capable of generating tone that you could only previously get with thousands of dollars worth of gear, at volumes that simply aren't practical 99.9% of the time.  It's a great time to be a guitar player. ",

Sounds good running into a tube guitar amp, a full range monitor, or sent to front of house to go into a PA. These can be had for about 100 used and are a great value. Been using mine everyday for about two years with no issues. Very good tweak able sounds. Better sounds than I thought possible...not digital sounding unless you try and go too 'high gain'. ",
