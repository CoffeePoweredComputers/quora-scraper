This one I recorded in a quiet room using just the mic on my computer   This one I recorded with a Samson go mic that i picked up at Sam Ash for $30 on sale   See the difference? It really is night and day. What's great is that microphone I got was only $30. That's a nothing investment. If you are in a pinch the mic in your laptop will do the trick if you get a very quiet space and you speak clearly. I'm telling you though, pick up a Samson go mic if you plan on doing multiple videos. Best decision you will ever make. ",
