It\u2019s produced by the members themselves and it\u2019s also going to be let out during these bad times events that are occurring to the world. One day imma tell my kids or grand-kids that I lived through this event and have known BTS. I am proud of BTS work. Usually they\u2019d also had to report it to Bang PD them but this time they get to fully do what they want. I am so happy and can\u2019t wait to see their work! The photo\u2019s are MIND BLOWING. Literally everything was trending. I love BTS efforts and their hard work. They deserve everything. LITERALLY everything. LOL after a few minutes of ARMYs freaking out on Twitter here\u2019s Namjoon posting on Twitter. He must have been spying on us with all the hashtags trending.  ",
