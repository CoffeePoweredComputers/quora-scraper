If anything, hardworking guitarist/producer Paul Waaktaar-Savoy\u2019s development of the A-ha sound into sophisticated pop music with surprisingly thoughtful lyrics over the past 35+ years has sure paid off, as 45 singles[3] off of ten studio albums[4] released with a wide-reaching audience around the globe has cumulatively made them so much bigger than when they first hit it in America. There are no less than a dozen A-ha tracks that will come to mind if you ask some folks about A-ha in many parts of the globe, and some of their biggest hits actually were released in the past decade and a half. . . . EDIT 2019/8/27 : Reading through the sheer diversity of posted comments on this answer for a second\u2026 If anything, I have a hunch that many people\u2019s rather polarized opinions about the multi-hit success of A-ha (or lack thereof) pretty much quantifies what the original question was asking, and everyone\u2019s input has been greatly appreciated :)  Footnotes[1] Poll: Top 10 One-Hit Wonders[2] a-ha - Music Norway EN[3] a-ha singles | a-ha live[4] A-ha discography - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "I consistently end up shaking my head when I read articles about \u201cone-hit wonders.\u201d Inevitably, these lists include acts that have definitely had more than one hit. To be fair, there may not be agreement on what is considered a \u201chit.\u201d If we are talking about the U.S., however, I would consider the Billboard Hot 100 chart to be the measure of whether or not a song was a \u201chit.\u201d In the strictest of definitions, I would say any act with more than one Hot 100 entry could not be considered a one-hit wonder. However, some might argue that a \u201chit\u201d needs to have at least charted in the top 40. Or top 20. Or top 10. As you can see, this certainly muddies the discussion. However, some of the most laughable claims I\u2019ve seen in various articles include Sugarloaf (who had top 10 hits with \u201cGreen-Eyed Lady\u201d AND \u201cDon\u2019t Call Us, We\u2019ll Call You\u201d), The Knack (\u201cMy Sharona\u201d #1, \u201cGood Girls Don\u2019t\u201d #11), and Aha (#1 hit with \u201cTake on Me\u201d and a top 20 hit with \u201cThe Sun Always Shines on TV\u201d). Even more ludicrous are claims that Survivor was a one-hit wonder (\u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d #1, \u201cBurning Heart\u201d #2, three more top tens with \u201cHigh on You,\u201d \u201cThe Search Is Over,\u201d and \u201cIs This Love\u201d). There\u2019s also Toto (\u201cAfrica\u201d #1, \u201cRosanna\u201d #2, top ten hits with \u201cHold the Line\u201d and \u201cI Won\u2019t Hold You Back\u201d). On the flip side, the article \u201cThe Complete List of True One-Hit Wonders\u201d does a great job highlighting more than 50 acts who have only had one top 40 hit. ",
