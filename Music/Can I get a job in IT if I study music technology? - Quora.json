I started my web development career right out of college and have been working as a web developer ever since. It is absolutely a possibility. You will actually find that there are a lot of people in the IT sector that are musicians. There are also a lot of people who are good at math. And people who speak other languages. That is not a coincidence - these fields are all related. They are all Symbolic Systems, that is, systems that are comprised of symbols that translate to different things. Music - notes are translated into sounds. Math - symbols are translated into mathematical expressions. Language - letters are translated into sounds. Programming - code is translated into machine-executable code. If you are good at any one of these things, chances are you will be good at the other 3 as well. ",

Music development app developers, like Learn piano in a fun and easy way - Piano apps to learn how to play piano (ok that's supposed to be a link but Quora changed it for me) look for, actually require, that all their tech people play an instrument.  Publishing houses, recording studios, all manner of segments of the music industry rely more and more on technology so I say GO FOR IT!   ",
