            "answer_text": "Well, let me explain it this way. Gird your loins. No saggy, soggy bottom, please. Pull up your socks, zip your fly and you got a booger at your nose tip. Diggin\u2019 for potatoes again, huh? Glad to perform the social merits. The arrival of The Beatles signaled by their success in both the U.K. and America and then the rest of the world, that a phenomenon known as the British Invasion, as the media of the time put it, had begun. They opened the floodgates. The Beatles were portrayed as at the prow of the ship. Everything else that came up in the wake of HMS Beatles was popular and originating from Britain. The U.K. which had been living in black and white drollery, drudgery, and dreariness since the end of the war suddenly went technicolor with the advent of Beatlemania. The Beatles shook up the U.K Something was happening and it was generating a worldwide tsunami of British rock and toll. After The Fabs conquered America, anything and everything British was super cool. It was a cultural craze and shift. It spread around the world. Television saw to that. British bands were \u2018\u2019it\u2019\u2019 and the happening thing. Madison Avenue and the advertising, merchandising industries pricked up their ears. Cash registers were ka-ching-ing. So, just to prove there is method to my madness, I will rattle off a few band names. The Kinks, Gerry & The Pacemakers, The Dave Clark Five, Tom Jones, Petula Clark, The Hollies, Herman\u2019s Hermits, Eric Burdon & The Animals, Manfred Mann, The Who, The Yardbirds, Donovan, The Small Faces, Dusty Springfield, The Merseybeats, The Spencer Davis Group and on and on\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026and then there were The Rolling Stones. They were a part of that tidal wave. of brilliant talent from Britain. And it was inevitable that the media, looking for an entree in explaining this youth phenomenon of rock and roll and Brit mania to the parents of their Brit crazed kids., created this comparison angle of Beatles versus Stones. Why the Stones? Because they were the next most prominent in exposure and the next big successful band in terms of hits on the radio. Their live appearances stirred up riots and melees. They even had a few run-ins with the law. The press loves the smell of scandal. Tall poppies are seen much more easily by the media. The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were on their radar. And they zeroed in and created this fake rivalry myth. The Beatles were at the top of the flagpole and The Rolling Stones A CLOSE SECOND\u2026..and the flagpole is greased. That\u2019s fame and notoriety for you. And maybe even the publicity machinations of managers Brian Epstein and Andrew Loog Oldham. And what did the parents of those Brit-mania-ed kids see? They saw some long hairs but they conceded The Beatles were a bit more spiffed up in their matching suits and singing harmless teen twaddle. Parents could be a bit more relaxed about The Beatles. They had a cuter, soft around the edges, charming, cuddly, teddy bear pop idol image. They could understand why their daughters would go gaga. The Rolling Stones, however, were another matter. The parents saw longhairs but they were scruffier looking, perhaps a little menacing, they looked \u2018\u2019grotty\u2019\u2019. Even a television appearance on the Dean Martin show involved The Stones being introduced by host Dean Martin making jokes about their hair length and fleas. There was a newspaper headline of the times, \u2018\u2019Would you let your daughter marry a Roling Stone?\u2019\u2019 Parents saw the Stones and were worried, should they lock up their daughters? should they censor their kid's record collection? These Rolling Stones, hmmm, they look subversive, anti-authoritarian, anti-establishment, ruffians, goons, hooligans and they attracted that sort of crowd. The Stones were trouble. The Beatles were a safer bet. They\u2019d even performed for The Queen and got awarded M.B.E.s And the media just latched onto this and played it up, this dichotomy, this fear of the parents, these polar opposites, this supposed rivalry between the bands. People bought into this scheme and fed it at the same time. You know how bullshit goes. It rolls downhill and gathers more shit. What was a little horsie patoot gathered size and strength, but it was still patoot. Those who had their olfactory senses intact, still discerned the smell of shit. Others pinched their noses and rolled with it. They got rolled into the joint and smoked. Who were the smokers? Aye, there\u2019s the rub. Everybody must get stoned, as Dylan would sing. The rock and roll youth voted with their feet and their record-buying power. Fans who wanted their teen angst anthems and danceable rock and roll latched onto The Beatles. Fans who wanted their rock to be a little more dirty ass and discarded tampons latched onto The Rolling Stones. Fans who wanted to scream and wet their panties while touching themselves, latched onto The Beatles. Fans that wanted to drink beer at the pub before the show, get toshed and cause a riot at the show, latched onto The Rolling Stones. Fans who wanted to scream, wet themselves and faint, touch themselves and revive, latched onto The Beatles. Fans who wanted to toss chairs, condom balloons and bottles onstage and grab the band members, rip their clothes off and rip out their privates, went to a Rolling Stones show. Fans who wanted to scream themselves hoarse, wet themselves, faint, come to, scream and piss themselves again, touch themselves and climax went to a Beatles show. Fans who wanted to shove Keith Richard\u2019s guitar up his ass, rape Mick Jagger, rip out his dick and use it for a dildo and fuck Brian Jones with it, went to a Rolling Stones show. They\u2019d spare Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman. They\u2019d have the dubious honor of watching. See, this stupid fake myth of Beatles vs Stones rivalry is so ridiculous that I can make silly, asinine comedy of it (or some semblance). The fact of the matter is that there was no rivalry or a yin yang dichotomy. The members of both bands were friends. They even socialized. They\u2019d run into each other at the same swank parties, the same bars, and clubs, shops, restaurants, film premieres around London. They\u2019d visit each other at their various residences, they\u2019d pop in on each other's studio sessions. They\u2019d even be chivalrous and civil. They might contribute something to a recording and not be credited or use a pseudonym. Jagger might call up Lennon or McCartney and ask if the new Stones single was going to conflict on the charts with anything The Beatles had in store for their next single, were the planned release date schedules going to be a problem.? This was the actual kind of relations the members of both bands had going. George Harrison was a guest at Keith Richard\u2019s house at Redlands and left before the police raided it and busted everybody. Jagger appeared in the video of All You Need Is Love. Jagger and Marianne Faithful were part of the entourage that went to Bangor for the Maharishi's lecture. Jagger and Jones and Lennon McCartney jetted and partied with Tara Browne, the heir to the Guinness fortune. Jagger and Faithful visited George Harrison at his home in Esher and decorated it with a painted slogan while he and Patti were away. It was that kind of relationship. They hung out. They were friends. The rivalry, comparison, the competition was a creation of media and. publicity. They had intercourse and had a baby, Beatles vs. Stones. ",
