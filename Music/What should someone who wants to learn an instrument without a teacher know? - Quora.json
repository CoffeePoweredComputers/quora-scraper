            "answer_text": "The first thing you should know is you are guaranteed to sound terrible at first!! Even so, don\u2019t let that discourage you! The number one thing to remember about learning an instrument is, \u201cPractice makes perfect!\u201d Next, what ever instrument you are choosing to learn, there are many beginner music books that will show you what to do to make a sound, tune that sound, turn that sound into a tune, and finally turn a tune into music. Many years ago I taught myself to play saxophone by simply focusing on the instructions and fingering charts in a beginners book. That was the first week of school that year and by the end of the first semester I had reached 2nd chair over 4 other students who were in weekly lessons with a teacher! As the years progressed I moved on from Alto sax to Baritone. The best compliment I have ever received while performing came after one of our Christmas concerts. The head of our school\u2019s History department asked me who our amazing bassoonist was and I had to reply that we didn\u2019t have one, the instrument she was hearing was my Baritone Saxophone! Now, when I think back to that first week, it was a struggle. I was squawking, squeaking and totally terrible, but with patience, persistence, a few tips from fellow players, and lots of practice I had achieved such a skill level that I could make that big, bellowing beast made of brass sound just like the much smaller, more mellow, mahogany king of orchestral bass woodwinds. Thus I come back around to my previous statement, \u201cPractice makes Perfect!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "ORIGINAL QUESTION: What should someone who wants to learn an instrument without a teacher know? Anyone who wishes to self-teach themselves anything will do well to acknowledge beforehand that: Your student will be highly motivated.Your teacher will be terrible.Some important details will inevitably be skipped because you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know.Ultimately everyone is \u201cself-taught\u201d, meaning: You have to do the work. The greatest teacher in the world can\u2019t drag you, kicking and screaming, to proficiency. The only way to \u201cget good\u201d is to practice and practice and practice some more.Ultimately, everyone learns from those who went before, be that teachers, more experienced players, YouTube vids, books, or whatever medium you choose. Knowledge is knowledge. Seek it out wherever it may be found.Learn the difference between practicing and playing.Remember, the reason you\u2019re doing all that practicing is so you can have fun playing. Don\u2019t forget to have fun playing.",

            "answer_text": "I think in a situation like this ,everyone needs to be aware that even a relatively bad teacher is better than trying to learn without guidance , as its so easy to over emphasise some aspects and under emphasise others if you rely on tutor books ,and this is also true of relying on online guidance . Someone who has already learned to play an instrument reasonably well would have gone through this process and know when to move onto new goals and not to drag with older goals , they would also know how to use a variety of material in different styles to help a student develop with a wide perspective . I would really recommend finding a tutor and talking to them at length before accepting them as a tutor , ( or they you as a student) maybe have a trial run of lessons before you fully commit . It would yield positive results . ",

Follow it next is that which inhibits action or inspiration any number of things mainly in the mind one idea is that you need a teacher to play music it depends on the kind of music and depends on desire and playing as often as you can if you are inhibited by \u201c\u201cplaying the wrong way\u201d. That could be a real fact. Or maybe not so maybe try on your own for a period of time then find a top rated teacher for just his or her observation of the technical side speak freely about your financial situation. That you can only visit this teacher once in a while but you can certainly play an instrument without a teacher takes some degree of talent and interest ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s absolutely possible to gain a level of proficiency on an instrument, but it takes more time and motivation to push through when it\u2019s difficult. That can be really hard to do when inspiration is lacking, so listen to lots of different artists who play your chosen instrument, as well as a wide range of other music. I taught myself guitar for 2 years before taking lessons - I already played keyboards, so I had a headstart. I enjoyed it and made fairly decent progress, but once I started taking lessons, my playing progressed exponentially and I was introduced to styles I wouldn\u2019t have explored otherwise. I\u2019ve also got a more solid understanding of how music works, so I can improvise and have also been able to pick up other instruments since. If you take up lessons, you get more out of the lessons the more you put in - from a teacher\u2019s perspective, my students who are dedicated to practicing not only progress quicker but have developed a love of music. Lessons are an investment, but one that will enrich your life. Hope this helps, Rob ",

Additionally, without guidance, you will likely accept and play to your weakness and not learn how to overcome them. That means you will accumulate a many bad habits. ",
