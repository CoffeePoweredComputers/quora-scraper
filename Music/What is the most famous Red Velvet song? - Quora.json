            "answer_text": "The most famous Red Velvet song was Red Flavour. It placed very high on digital charts and was a hit domestically - one of the most played songs of the summer. It was both a mixture of bad and good promotion in the case of SM: they timed the release well so the song fit well with the season and the hot temperatures in South Korea, however, it was released round about the same time as their labelmate EXO which meant they got less wins than they could\u2019ve had (although Heize also dominated digital charts at the same time, some shows don\u2019t let music show wins happen if you aren\u2019t promoting or performing the song). The songs before and after were also popular but overall, Red Flavour is one of the most recognisable Red Velvet songs and still one of the most popular. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Red Flavor is their most popular song. Definitely heard a lot throughout the summers since it came out. The song itself is very addictive and the fruit themed music video is wacky and entertaining to watch. Plus it\u2019s become one of those songs other idols would cover on variety shows. On the other hand, I think Ice Cream Cake was the song that really put Red Velvet on the map. At least, that was the song that brought my attention to them. It\u2019s also another song a lot of other idols cover on shows. ",
