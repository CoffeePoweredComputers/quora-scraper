            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a list of books that were/are on my 2020 \u2018\u2019to read\u2019\u2019 list- This Side Of Paradise \u2013 F. Scott Fitzgerald.One of the books that every single college student should make a point of reading before they graduate is This Side of Paradise. The classic novel is witty and romantic as it tells the story of a Princeton student who becomes disillusioned with life after graduation.Brave New World \u2013 Aldous Huxley.A Brave New World is a dark and satirical look at a utopian future where individuals do not fit into the system. Every student needs to read this book and explore the question of whether it is more important to accept things as they have always been or to fight for the things that will make you happy.One Hundred Years Of Solitude \u2013 Gabriel Garcia Marquez.One of the most famous novels in the world today is Gabriel Garcia Marquez' One Hundred Years of Solitude. It is an important book for every student to make time to read as it contains a valuable lesson about the importance and the value of friends and family.A Farewell To Arms \u2013 Ernest Hemingway.Ernest Hemingway has long been considered one of the greatest American writers, and A Farewell to Arms is considered one of his greatest works. The author apparently rewrote it almost 40 times in order to get it perfect, so every student surely owes him the honour of reading it before they graduate!The Grapes Of Wrath \u2013 John Steinbeck.The Grapes of Wrath is an incredibly moving tale of love, friendship, resilience and courage. It recounts an Oklahoma farmer and his family driven from their home and made to journey to California in the midst of the Great Depression.Lord Of The Flies \u2013 William Golding.Lord of the Flies was first published in 1954 and it was as controversial then as it remains today. It is a classic which has been categorized equally as a myth, a parody, a morality tale and an allegory. It tells the tale of a broken society illustrated with a group of young boys stranded on an island and forced to fend for themselves.To Kill A Mockingbird \u2013 Harper Lee.There is a good chance that any college student who is studying English, the Arts or Literature will already have To Kill a Mockingbird on their set reading list. It is also studied in many high schools. However, if you have not already read the masterpiece then it should be added to your 'to read' list as a priority. The book has key themes of racism and racial equality.Charlotte's Web \u2013 E.B. White.While it is often dismissed as simply a children's book, Charlotte's Web has plenty to offer college students as well. The book challenges us to re-evaluate the way that we treat animals. Would we act differently if they could share with us their hopes, dreams and fears? Charlotte's Web serves as a poignant reminder that every living creature has its place on Earth!Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions \u2013 Dan Ariely.This book is brilliant. And though it is written by a man about men's world for men, a woman can even read it simply because this book is about us knowing what is good for us, having free will, acting upon it, rationalizing about our life, but in the end these are all the things that get us into trouble. So, what kinds of choices we should take into account that would shape not only our decisions, but our life? Interested? Read the book.Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking \u2013 Malcolm Gladwell.Have you ever wondered what lies behind when you are making quick decisions? This book is about us thinking without thinking, about us making choices that aren't as simple as they seem to be in the blink of an eye.",
