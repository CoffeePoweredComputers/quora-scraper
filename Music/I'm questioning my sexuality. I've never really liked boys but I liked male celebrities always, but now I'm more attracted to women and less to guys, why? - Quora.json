            "answer_text": "Sexual orientation and sexuality are a tricky thing. It\u2019s not at all as clearly defined as you may be lead to believe and most existing labels such as straight, gay, bisexual, etc. are really just guidelines people use to ease communication. There are tons of people who do not neatly fit into these categories and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. These labels don\u2019t necessarily have to mean much of anything and they certainly don\u2019t have to define who you are as a person. For example, you could be almost exclusively into women but then meet one or two guys in your life whom you\u2019re attracted to, as well. It doesn\u2019t really matter what you call it, it doesn\u2019t really matter whether that makes you straight or bisexual or neither because those are just simplified, artificial, man-made labels made to describe a spectrum of sexual attraction that is much more complex. There are guys who identify as straight but sometimes fool around with men or non-binary people. There are guys who identify as gay but sometimes have sex with women and so on and so forth. Now, if you really want to explore your sexuality and get to the bottom of things, the easiest, safest way to start (depending on where you live and what your circumstances are - if you\u2019re somewhere where consuming gay pornography is illegal or dangerous, please disregard this advice) might be to watch gay porn and see if it does anything for you. That being said, it\u2019s entirely possible that you won\u2019t like any of the gay porn you\u2019ll find even though you may be attracted to certain types of men in certain circumstances. In that case, my advice would be to just not worry too much about it and go with the flow. You can assume that you\u2019re not attracted to men for the time being but still be open to the possibility of doing stuff with a guy if and when you ever get into a situation where you might want to. Like I said, don\u2019t let a label define you. Just because you may identify as straight, doesn\u2019t mean you have to let that word dictate your behaviour, desires or life choices. ",
