            "answer_text": "Five Ways to Find out if your partner is using dating sites.  Find their email address and enter it in the \u201cforgotten password\u201d feature found on most websites and apps. This will not tell you if the individual is actively using the particular site or app however it will let you know they did at one point.Look them up by phone number. Most dating apps on Android and IOS are linked to the users phone number. Most people use Tinder and Bumble so I would start there. Try logging into the account using their phone number while you are hanging out and if they look at their phone then chances are they just receives a login verification code. Create an account in the same vicinity as theirs. This can be time consuming if there are many active users but you can certainly find them yourself. Start with the most popular sites and apps everyone uses. Keep in mind that if your partner also suspects you of using dating sites or apps this method could lead to some hard questions.Use a service such as albion-services or buzzhumble to do the searching for you. Sometimes a little professional help is worth a couple dollars. Take notes on how the individual uses their mobile phone. If there is a lock on their phone and they don\u2019t receive notifications then chances are they are hiding something. Notifications being completely disabled is a huge red flag or if they always place their phone face down.I have a suggestion that may or may not work in your relationship. My policy is honesty and I set boundaries within the first month. I make it very clear that I want to be monogamous and that I don\u2019t like secrets. Serious partners shouldn\u2019t hide things. Some people go so far as to always keeping their social media accounts logged in on a mutual device and they share phone passwords. This may or may not work for you but if you show your partner you trust them completely they are much more likely to trust you back and there should be no excuses at that point. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a professional researcher (but maybe I should be), so my data is anecdotal and subjective, from personal experience only, and can be an IRL supplement to the technical methods shared by other respondents to this question. This is simply what I\u2019ve noticed. If you and your partner are living together, and in general cohabiting if you are married, your path to discovery is easier than if you are partners living separately, although there is always that occasion when you return home after an evening out with your partner and discover to your horror that you\u2019ve left your phone at your partner\u2019s house. Major alert, requiring immediate corrective action, requiring you to drive back to their house and get your phone. After dating many divorced men and after a few dates, increasing our mutual comfort level, I asked how/why they became divorced. This is a common conversation: Me: \u201cSo how did your divorce happen?\u201d Them: \u201cI cheated.\u201d [or maybe a more informative variant] Me: \u201cHow did your wife/husband find out?\u201d Them: \u201cI couldn\u2019t find my phone and my wife/husband/kid found it\u201d. Me: \u201cOh. Right. Of course they did.\u201d But here are some other methods of discovery: 1.) Yes, of course, the most frequent situation for learning about your parter\u2019s use of dating apps is, when in a hurry, you pick up the wrong phone and see an image of an attractive woman/man occupying the home screen. This only works if you and your partner have identical phones with identical cases. If your partner\u2019s phone case is red, and yours is black then you would be less likely to grab their phone by mistake. 2.) If you try a dating site, in order to find out if your SO is participating, then of course you have to use a trial and error method because you cannot ask directly \u201cnow, what dating sites to you use?\u201d Frequent swiping left and right, performed frequently enough can eventually turn up your partner in your daily feed of match wannabes. You and your partner would need to be using the same dating sites, though. However, this does not usually yield immediate results and can be labor- and time-intensive. You might be able to speed things up a bit by narrowing your search requirements to your specific location, where both you and your partner live. If you and your partner are using the same location, roughly, then your results would be limited to a narrower list than if you checked a range of \u201c5 miles\u201d to \u201c100 miles\u201d. 3.) You are researching something, looking for a specific screen, but you are having issues, or your phone\u2019s battery is low, or you can\u2019t find it and you need your phone right now but you have to wait until it at least charges to 10%. Then your partner, temporarily blind to the extreme dangers of phone sharing, tries to be helpful by offering their phone as an expedient. This solution is \u201cexpedient\u201d, but for what purpose? Besides being a temporary hack to fix your problem, it is also \u201cexpedient\u201d in apprising you of their dalliance. Items 1.) to 3.) above are all highly circumstantial and need a specific set of variables in order to work for checking out your partner\u2019s dating site status. 4.) Just ask them, if you dare. Possible answers: a.) \u201cOf course not, I\u2019m with you, we\u2019re a thing.\u201d This takes a highly-evolved person to respond in a factual non judgmental way, but of course\u2026if the person is highly-evolved you would not be having this conversation. b.) \u201cOMG how could you even think such a thing?!\u201d This implies that you are very insecure just by asking the question, and you\u2019ve lost a few points in their opinion of you as a partner. This is a case of \u201cIf you have to ask, there\u2019s your answer.\u201d c.) A variation on b.) \u201cOMG how could you even think such a thing?!\u201d, which turns the issue back to your SO if they are the anxious one. This demonstrates their insecurity as they wonder if their performance is adequate, if they are showing enough interest, commitment, general participation in the relationship, because why would their partner be asking, unless they have fallen off the bandwagon. d.) And, OMG, the terminally sarcastic response: \u201cYeah, I keep the apps to cover any possible breakup with you, so I\u2019ll be always current in my dating search\u201d. This is so offensive it\u2019s almost worse than if they actually were hanging out on the sites. Who wants to even be in a relationship with someone who dismisses your questions with such cavalier bravado. e.) \u201cYes, I am keeping them for a friend, who has to hide their dating app matches because they are married and don\u2019t want their spouse to find out.\u201d WTF?? Well what about when you find out, hmmm? You are a partner/spouse and you have already \u201cfound out\u201d. You know, it\u2019s exactly like that old story from high school, when your mother discovers your cannabis stash and you say \u201cOh it\u2019s not mine. I\u2019m keeping it for a friend\u201d. In the same way, they might say: \u201cOh that dating app isn\u2019t mine, I\u2019m just using it for my married friend who doesn\u2019t want their spouse/partner to find out.\u201d These \u201chow to\u2019s\u201d are, as mentioned above, circumstantial, and in need of corroborating evidence in order to be trusted, and, of course there is the \u201cdo nothing\u201d strategy of simply waiting; your partner\u2019s dating app status will be revealed and confirmed.

            "answer_text": "Hi, so if you are in a relationship and you are worried about the other party cheating, What are the ways of investigating that or determining that? This is Johnson you can check my profile for more details- you've probably seen many lists of how to determine if somebody is cheating, if they buy new clothes, new cologne perfume. That is all well and good but here is a hidden indicator of cheating that most people are not aware of. First of all, a cheater when they are going to be undertaking this activity is going to make sure that they are not going to get caught. How do they do that? Some people make sure you aren't going to be around to catch them so they are going to be very keen on what your activity is and your location during that time so be aware when the other person in that relationship is checking your activity especially if they are not really jealous about it, sometimes a cheater will be happy that you are going out with your girlfriends or even with co-workers to make sure you are not around. It has been discovered long time in the investigative world when i am hired by a party to do surveillance on a spouse or domestic partner and clients never really had any reason to suspect cheating, so i have let's say a husband that calls up and say i want to do surveillance on my wife to make sure she is not cheating so i do my job and check everything out, not cheating and nothing is wrong and i call up the client and he's fine, no you know most of the normal response to it so what i do i do a little investigation and found out that about 20 percent of surveillance requests in a relationship scenario is what i call circle-back which means that the party that is hiring is actually not hiring to determine cheating and they actually hire to make sure that their spouse or other party is not circling back to catch them cheating so in this case the party will be so insistent on making sure they are not going to get caught, they want to keep tabs on their spouse to make sure they are not going to make sure they are not going to be discovered. So here's how you check that out, give a suspicious answer to questions on your whereabouts( i mean something that might trigger them normally) see if the other party is jealous because if the other party isn't it might be an indication that they don't really care about where you are, they are just glad that you have somewhere especially if they say what time will you be back or are you sure you gonna go. Those are the type of things that are indicators. Then watch their activities right after they ask these questions, if they ask you for example where you are going to be on a Thursday morning from 9 am to 12 pm, at 12:15 pm check them out to see where they are at, see if their back home, see if they are at work and maybe stop by at work to make sure they are there. Don't try to do surveillance during the period they are telling you about because they are going to be really suspicious of that, check them out right afterwards and if you want to if their hair's messed up, if they smell like perfume, if their car is parked in a different place that's the time to do it, don't try to do surveillance when the action is going on and see if they double check your location. Circle back is a cheater's worst nightmare, don't circle back and find them, find it out surreptitiously so you know the answer before they know you do and then you have more control over what happens because if they find out, they are going to be even more careful the next time and it is going to be even harder. Unfortunately, a lot of these situations are out of your control. Hire the service of a pro LIKE ME To save you the stress,dedication and frustration that comes with finding out if your significant other is an infidel. It is advised that when hiring a professional you should seek a profound and experienced one like myself to avoid any future issue. Hire the service of a pro LIKE ME to save you the stress,dedication and partial frustration that comes finding out if you are being cheated on. In summary, get the peace of mind you deserve! ",

            "answer_text": "Ask her and be upfront about why you're worried she might be. She's your wife, you should have open communication to talk about anything. It's wrong to go snooping. It can make you become obsessed with finding something even if there's nothing to find. I really don't recommend it unless you truly feel she's hiding infidelity from you. If you're really worried after speaking with her: You can check or ask to check her browser history and messages/emails. Ask your friends to keep an eye out if they're on dating sites. Look for signs; she hides her phone and gets angry if you try to look while she's on it, she goes out randomly and when you ask to go with, she insists you to stay home, she stops talking to you about issues or starts fights before leaving the house, she showers right away when she gets home. To fix things: If you're feeling insecure about the strength of your relationship, it's time to make some changes. You are married, you both deserve to feel appreciated, loved and respected. Don't hold onto what happened yesterday; each day is new and deserves a new opportunity to become close, not hold resentment with your partner. Try doing new things to bring intimacy, sex and romance into your relationship. Ideas: stay up all night listening to music (jazz, instrumental,etc), have a few drinks and laugh and talk. Really look at each other, lightly touch each other on and off throughout the night. Go to the beach, have a picnic, camping or find a great walking trail. Spending time outside with your partner is very important. Listen to the wind, water and animals and you'll find a sense of calmness and bliss. Enjoy the sun, the rain or the snow, give yourselves good memories of the seasons together. Really think about what makes your wife happy and excited. Give her a surprise. Make her laugh and smile. She wants to feel special, if you make her feel this way, she'll want to make you feel good too. Have a conversation about what your wants and needs are and come to a compromise. This conversation should come up at least once a year, since again we're always changing and so will the relationship. Really listen to and try new things with each other. It's important to be IN your relationship and not just on \"autopilot\" doing the same things and having the same conversations every day. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three types of guys that may use an online dating app. Guy number 1 is looking for a life partner he will look for someone that fits his ideal profile and is most likely an introverted person just looking for true love . Guy number 2 is the player he finds easy targets to have quick uncomplicated sex. There are no shortage of girls available online that can be easily swept into the bed and this guy knows how to get them there. Hopefully and surley after being in a relationship with this guy you would know what type of character he is. This type of person will most likely be a player online and offline so the signs will be there. Guy number 3 uses online dating as a confidence boost. Each match for him is a sign he still has sex appeal. Rarely will this guy follow through unless the girl can totally break through to his inner desires. But this is your more genuine type of guy and not online to be a player. Now this is all a basic breakdown. If your current boyfriend has had many online hookups via the dating app previously you will always be wary of him. If he truly loves you and is happy with you he will delete all his dating apps. If he does it in front of you ,you know he cares for you. All those tinder matches will be lost its a very good test of his true intentions. You may need to check his phone again in a few days to see if he re installed the aps but if they there again it's pointless he will always go back again. You can always try catch him out by getting some friends from work or school that live close to his radius to see if he's online show them pics and tell them you think he's messing around. Overall there are major issues with the way we hook up these days. It's a very sad situation the way sex is now a few clicks away. However it's not always that simple but it's definitely an addiction for many and something that needs to change before society is tarnished by the negative effects. By the way for girls it's much easier they have like 30 matches at any time so you can always download your own app have a few sexy pics and watch the matches come in. I'm not condoning this type of thing but you can always fight fire with fire. It's very ugly. Show him your matches that will make him think twice and delete your apps together. Good luck you sound like a decent girl rather find someone who you trust unconditionally. Damn you smartphones :) ",

            "answer_text": "If your wife is on dating sites maybe that means she don\u2019t love you any more. There are some signs.1. Gut instinct Your at this site for a reason. And unfortunately it's one of the signs that your wife is getting more distant from you 2. You have to clean up after yourself I know it's old fashioned but women tend to care more about cleanliness than men. So when she stops caring about that, it's a sign she's stopped caring about your marriage 3. She doesn't seem to really care that much You start to notice that any issues you are facing she's not interested in. For example; when you begin to feel under the weather, once she might have suggested you stay in bed and made you meals. Now she hasn't even asked you about it. 4. Physically distant \u2013 no kissing, hugging etc. If your wife is hesitant to hug or kiss you then this is a sign. To be honest this can be a little late as this is one of the latter things (in her mind) that she will withdraw from. 5. She doesn't initiate anything, ever If you find that she isn't organizing anything new in your family then she's losing interest 6. She stops telling about her day and her life Wive's love to use their husbands as a sounding board. To talk and get things off their chests\u2026 If she starts withholding this information then this is a sign 7. Lack of face time A loving wife loves face time because it shows her that you care about her. If she's seems not that interested in sharing time with you and would rather be on her phone/tablet, talking with friends or out doing something else then this is cause for concern 8. Guilt trips Do you feel guilty about going out, even to work? If when your leaving your wife and she is in an unhappy mood this can trigger things. This is a sign 9. Sketchy behavior Have you started to notice that your wife has a new \u2018private life' that you don't have access too? This includes new email accounts, deleting history from devices, phone calls from numbers you don't know and even a second phone? 10. New wife Is your wife doing things she has never done before, or hasn't done in a while? I.e. joining the gym or buying a style of clothes that she hasn't worn in ages\u2026 maybe even new circles of friends? ",

            "answer_text": "If you were in a reasonably healthy relationship, the best way to find out anything about your husband would be asking him directly. Because you\u2019re asking the internet instead, it seems like you don\u2019t trust him and don\u2019t feel like asking is going to result in a truthful or safe response. You could do all sorts of snooping to try to find out if your husband is using a secret email address and an assumed name on dating sites, but it won\u2019t alleviate your pain or distrust. If you find nothing, will you believe he isn\u2019t cheating or will you believe, instead, that you haven\u2019t look hard enough? If snooping confirms your suspicions what will you do next? If you really think your husband is using a fake name and a secret email address to go on dating websites, why don\u2019t you simply assume it\u2019s true and take the next step, whatever that is? If you had proof, would you insist he stop cheating or would you file for divorce? Would you expose him to his family and yours? Would you set up your own secret dating profile as a weird way to even things up? If you believe he\u2019s a duplicitous sneak, are you willing to be a duplicitous sneak to prove it to yourself? Implicit in your question is the insecurity you feel in your relationship. Don\u2019t drive yourself crazy looking for evidence that your insecurity isn\u2019t paranoia. Ask yourself instead if you\u2019re willing to remain in a relationship in which you\u2019re so deeply insecure, if you\u2019re not just waiting around for him to leave you, or if you\u2019re okay becoming the kind of person who feels the need to play detective and cop with her husband.

How to find out if someone is on a dating site 1. Create an online dating profile \u201cI did not have to do that in my case as I didn\u2019t suspect anything and my friend had come across his profile by pure chance. Nevertheless, not everyone is going to be as lucky as me. If you feel like something is different in your partner\u2019s behavior, you might want to create a fake online dating profile and see if you can spot them on there.\u201d 2. Change your information  \u201cDon\u2019t use your own photo, age, appearance features, or any other information that might lead him to that it is you. Many online dating sites allow the users to know who viewed their profile. You don\u2019t want them to find out that you have been checking up on him. Be creative and change your information as much as possible. Don\u2019t forget to also change your profession, education, personality traits, goals and other.\u201d 3. Check the browsing history  \u201cAnother way on how to find out if someone is registered on a dating site is to check the browsing history. If you and your partner share a computer or any other device, you can check the browsing history and see what comes up. While a lot of people tend to delete their browsing history when they are hiding something, there is a chance they could have forgotten to do so. It is not a very reliable method, as your partner most likely would delete the history after being on the online dating site. However, if they did not erase it, you will have all the proof you need right there. Don\u2019t try to access the device that does not belong to you as this is an illegal activity. These things are enough to help you out. I think that I\u2019ve been of help somehow. ",

Sound of voice. Arguing for no apparent reason and it not making sense. Blaming things more on me. Having an \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d attitude. Remembering. Can\u2019t remember where they were at. Saying one thing, when they said another earlier. Lying all of a sudden. Making up stories. Final nail in coffin. Friends on dating site seeing their picture and profile. Creating a fake profile and interacting with them. A friend did this and went looking for him and found him. I hope and pray you don\u2019t find out there is something going on. I am hoping it\u2019s an issue with one self. Where your partner is struggling on who they are. For you to go through this, can be devastating, to say the least. You must feel there is something wrong, the best thing you can do is to ask the person, if they are not happy anymore. Maybe you can strike up a conversation and your worries can be out on the table. That would be the healthiest way for you both. See how he reacts. Maybe that will stop the person, before they do something wrong that they will regret. Another way is to pay for spy apps. Just be careful when choosing this way it can cost your relationship and /or may be illegal. Read all about the spy apps prior to purchase. Good Luck ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t. At least, not without committing a federal crime. The only definitive way to determine whether she is on any dating site would be to get into her phone or computer, and check her internet browser history. However if you do this, especially without her knowledge or permission, and you get caught, you could be facing up to 20 years in prison and a fine $15 000 (in Canada). Therefore it is far better to just trust her, if she tells you she isn\u2019t on a dating site, believe her. And if you don\u2019t trust her, then the relationship is already over, because cannot work without trust. And even if she is on a dating site there is nothing you can do about it. Unless you have the time and money to constantly monitor her internet use (and even if you do, DON\u2019T) she will find an opportunity to go on it. Therefore it is up to you to determine how you would want to deal with it. If you decide that you don\u2019t like your girlfriend going on a dating site, then you break up with her. Or, you could you try to be secure in your relationship, know that going on a dating site doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019s cheating on you, that if she doesn\u2019t want to be with you, then she would have already left the relationship, and that she does have the right to leave the relationship at any time she wishes, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Don\u2019t worry about things you can\u2019t control, all you should worry about is being the kind of guy she doesn\u2019t want to leave, and build the kind of relationship she doesn\u2019t want to leave, either.

            "answer_text": "By using the phrase, \u201cother dating sites\u201d, are you implying that there exists a list of dating websites he is allowed to be on , or did you mean to say \u201cHow do I find out if my boyfriend is using dating websites?\u201d If you did actually mean the former, then you may also want to consider the fact that your boyfriend may also be the boyfriend of others as well. If you are OK with this, then I am unsure why him being on other websites would be more bothersome than this fact. If you actually meant the latter, which makes more sense to me, then there is somethings you can do to discern if he is on other sites. But before you begin, ask yourself why you suspect that he is, and if you have any real reason for that assumption. Once you begin down the path of mistrust and suspecting cheating, it is an arduous, if not impossible task for the relationship to continue. Tread carefully. If curiosity does get the better of you, download some of the more common apps, set the search radius to <1km and swipe through, provided of course that he is within that search radius himself. It is common to use fake names in scenarios like these, so you\u2019ll have to be paying attention. Not on any of these apps? Try other sites. Remember this: don\u2019t let your insecurities ruin your relationship. Make sure you have good reason to suspect this is occurring before you proceed. The more you feed it, and the slower you act, the deeper the mistrust grows. Nip it before it ruins everything. ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of those questions that has an obvious answer and generates an even more important question\u2026  Answer: Ask them. Follow Up Question: Why don\u2019t you ask them? Why did you think it was a better idea to ask a q&a forum vs. just asking them? Are they that hard to talk to? Would you not trust their answer? If not, why. My crystal ball says you will answer my questions with the following: \u201cI have asked them, I brought it up because I suspect they are on dating sites. They just brushed it off and said \u201cof course not\u201d and if I try to bring it up again they get angry with me.\u201d The bottom line: You don\u2019t trust them. Short of them sharing all of their passwords on their computer and phone with you, and you searching dating sites you will never know. That\u2019s what trust is all about. Why don\u2019t you trust them? Two possible reasons: Because they are just untrustworthy, and have done things to betray your trust in the past. You already caught them with a rofile when they said they didn\u2019t have one. Suggestion: Break up now. It doesn\u2019t ever get any better, it just gets worse and you deserve the same level of trust/respect that you are giving.Because you see the world s you behave. You yourself are a bit paranoid and untrustworthy. You put yourself in their shoes and you see that you would cheat and be secretive. Suggestion: Break up now, get over these trust issues, love yourself and then give that new person to the next relationship and you won\u2019t have to ask a forum about stuff like this again.",

You can take that address and paste it right in to your browser, and it will resolve to the site. Try this - 129.42.38.10 (That\u2019s IBM.) This is likely to work even if he is using his phone, since most people use their wireless connection to connect their smartphones to the internet when at home (saves data charges).

The downside: Suppose you ask and she says \"no I don't have an account. No matter whether she's lying or not, you've made the relationship weaker because she knows you don't trust her. If she lied then you still don't know. Suppose she says, \"yes I do\",  depending on what she uses it for,  you may be going down the road of splitting up (which might not necessarily be a bad thing).  Option 2:Find the account. Either see the app on her phone or find the account using a fake account and putting in all her attributes. This can be a huge time sink and might make you seem paranoid/untrusting. If you find the account,  then you know,  but if you don't find the account,  either it doesn't exist or you didn't look hard enough.  Option 3: Don't do anything. If she's using tinder to hook up,  you'll find out after a little while anyway. She'll slip up, especially if you're looking out for odd behavior. ",

Often the profile picture used on social networking websites are used on dating sites as well, so start with that/those. Next, try searching his email address. The average person has 3 email addresses; 1 primary (Barbie_NaughtyPrincessXxX), one secondary for professional reasons (John_Smith), and one for spam (Tom_doe_spam123). So search his email address(es) on Google as well as other search platforms to see what pops up. Beyond that, you\u2019d going to have to create an account and manually search through these sites to find him. If this is a mobile dating app, things can be a bit harder. Though you often have to link your the dating app to a social networking profile, these apps generally do not have a search or \u2018find my friends\u2019 feature. So you\u2019ll have to toil through profile after profile to find him. Of course if he happens to see your profile first, this can be in vain if he blocks you before you have a chance to run into him. In short, there are methods, but at the same time there\u2019s quite a bit of discouragement. There are a lot of dating sites and apps out there and this could turn into days or even weeks of searching and still you could come back with nothing. ",

However it's a solution to a perceived problem.Typing an email address and random password into the login screen of some dating sites can produce false positives such as 'Your Password is incorrect' instead of 'Your username and password are invalid' This could give an indication that he may have possibly signed up.Check his email. Then use the forget password feature and reset the password.What I've found from experience, by being cheated on and being accused of cheating is that the best thing to do is assume he is on a dating site and don't get hung up about it.  Sometimes the effort of trying to find out outweighs the fact that you could just end the relationship and move on. ",

The problem with trying to find evidence of cheating is that not finding evidence isn't going to make your distrust go away. It's just going to make you think that sneaky bastard is sneakier than you thought and you'll just keep wasting more of your time looking for the smoking gun and driving yourself insane. You're never going to know for sure so just assume you would have found something and do whatever you would do if you did. Sometimes you get a feeling and you're right. Sometimes you're wrong.

I promised myself never to degrade myself this way again, I didn\u2019t trust him and I was right. So I decided to trust my instinct instead of that sharade. A piece of advice, Never waste your mental and emotional energy stalking and spying on your husband. This is so degrading and self humiliating. If you're that uncomfortable with him; 1) Either you're right and he's cheating. or 2) You're wrong and your feelings comes from your insecurity issues. In case of 1; you don't need proof (it's just the inner voice of Gotcha I was right and I got proof). So if you can see the change then trust your instinct and leave. Save yourself a long path of self degrading just to for the sake of saying I'm right. In case of 2; get professional help to save yourself the self humiliation of spying on your husband. But women enjoy getting that proof to rub their husband's nose in his dirty act for other purposes like winning or bargaining or just putting him under the thumb. For me it's just dump the jerk who's consuming my energy with doubt and I'll be the winner. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. There seems to be a hint of distrust there embedded. In your question. The easy answer is to look him straight in the eye and ask him. As a man I know we don't lie well. If when he answers he looks away from you and doesn't maintain eye contact, it's not good. He should be able to keep solid eye contact with you during his answer. Now take my answer with a grain of salt. I am old fashioned. If I am in a relationship I do not wander. I owe that to her if for no other reason than out of respect. After all we are both risking some thing very important. If the relationship is having problems let's talk it out without fluffing the problem. If it still doesn't seem to be fixable then we will agree to end it and both of us leave with honor. Notice I did not say without hurt. To keep this from occurring both men and women should figure out what they want, not need, and hold to those standards when looking for a relationship, I call them deal killers. If you find yourself smitten be sure to let him know your deal killers and that he understands them. He should also understand If they are violated its over. I am in a wonderful relationship with a terrific woman. We love and respect each other. We both have deal killers, I understand hers and she mine, and we both understand the consequences. ",

            "answer_text": "Well the short answer is ask him.  I think in relationships trust is very important, and if you have a feeling or if you think he might be on dating sites, you need to ask yourself why? Is this a \"you\" thing or a \"him\" thing.  If you've had bad experiences in past relationships regarding trust you need to look to the root of this problem and work on it yourself.  If your husband in the past has given you pause and you are considering this as an issue because it was in the past, then I think this is a bigger problem.  In either case this can be a serious issue if not taken care of, and this can corrode your relationship.  So instead of figuring out if he is on dating sites, once you've determined if the issue stems from you are him you can take appropriate action.  If it's your issues seek a certified therapist to discuss this with.  If it's him, you might want to have a dialogue with him and potentially you both should consider seeing a marriage counselor to help you settle this issue once and for all. Good Luck!  ",

But strikingly beautiful, the kind of dream woman your boyfriend would flip over. It\u2019s a test and a severe one, of trust and loyalty. If you\u2019ve given your new profile his zip or postal code, you can do a search, with very narrow criteria, like his age and size and other criteria to pull up a small list of men who are within a few miles of him. There are other ways, more nefarious, to gain such intelligence about his online activities, but this one\u2019s free and if it\u2019s entrapment, he has no defence. ",

If you make good decisions, then you won\u2019t have to worry about selecting someone who cheats. So, the 1st point is to trust yourself. Then ask yourself if you trust the girlfriend. If you do not trust the girlfriend, then you should end the relationship because you will never truly be happy. No spy app in the world will be able to quiet your concerns. Because when you\u2019re looking for something, like cheating, you will surely find something; anything, that your mind will twist into cheating behavior due to lack of trust.

It's like oh you're not so good yourself, so I should be excused.  Keep yourself clean and document any physical evidence you can - through ethical means. If she is cheating, your efforts will not be wasted and she will eventually lose in the long run.  If you're really worried:1. Just look at the notification screen from your gf's phone more often.2. Just be wary of how she spends her time. If you have suspicion then:3. Ask your good friends who use Tinder to look out for her profile while they're Tindering. If she is cheating (assuming you're in a monogamous long term relationship), it'll eventually come out. Just have the mental preparation. ",

If he did something that makes you question that he might not be happy with you think if its you feeling insecure, I know I have to question myself often on this before ending up with cheating conclusion. After that assess what reason made you think he might be on one? Did you see his browser history or did someone tell you he is? Be mindful how easy it is to misinterpret information we find or given so it is always best to ask. If he refuses to answer its pretty negative and if he says no you'll have to consider how much you feel his is worthy of trust. Perhaps considering if he has before engaged in questionable behavior behind your back.  ",

Be very careful about this one. If you get caught, he won't believe it was all just about checking you there. And you'll have the game turned upside down.

You could join a bunch of dating sites anonymously and search for him.

If you can't have open, honest communication in your relationship you shouldn't be in it. Now having said that you can't put boundaries on someone who hasn't agreed to those boundaries. If you and him have not agree on what your relationship is or is going to be, consist of, etc then what he does isn't open for debate. This is where people get mixed up in relationships and find out the person they're with isn't really the person they thought they were, etc. Clear communication of expectations is vital to a healthy functioning relationship.

It\u2019s called TRUST!IF you do not trust your GF then you have NO relationship. Relationships are based on Trust. If you still suspect she is on a dating site then time will tell and eventually you will find out. Just a matter of time. The thing is\u2026without proof, you must give her the benefit of doubt.

It\u2019s like a form of fantasy, but it usually gives you a clue that they are really dissatisfied in the relationship with you, on some level. It\u2019s much better to have a sincere talk with her, ask if she\u2019s happy, and how she feels about you. Tell her how you feel. Yes, I know guys often dislike sharing feelings or fears, but this better than spying on someone you care about. ",

If not, well do it next time you are over at her house while you are in the bathroom. Just dont let her see you doing it. And whatever you do, do not resort to stalking behavior.

The other option is to ask your friends to do it, or borrow their logins. Tinder might be tricky since you can\u2019t search for an individual person. Some people will check their partners phones and emails themselves. To me, that\u2019s invasion of privacy, but to each their own. You can also just ask. This comes with the obvious risks, but if you know your man or woman well enough, you can tell if he or she is lying. All the best on your quest! ",

If you don't trust him when he never gave you a reason for that, this is your problem. Not his. Breakup with him. Find someone else you actually trust. If by any chance, he gave you any reason for this then communication is the key, ask him. But don't point fingers, talk camly about it. Men hate to be put against the wall especially if they haven't done anything wrong or even if they do. They close down or even lie without even meaning to.Just be thoughtful, don't jump to conclusions before you talked to him. If he really likes you, he will answer you. ",

Think back to the last time she tagged you in a funny meme. It is nice to know someone knows you and gets you. #4 I can\u2019t wait to be with you again.

It's sad, but it sounds like it's time for you to MoveOn. The reality is that most relationships are not in a place where they don't trust their partners. If you're with someone you can't trust, it's a very unhealthy relationship. Choosing someone you trust to be your partner is about loving yourself. Good luck- Mary ",
