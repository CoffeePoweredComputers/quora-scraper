            "answer_text": "Alright\u2026  Emo is a lifestlye. That means they dress a certain way, listen to certain music, etc\u2026Depression and Self-Harm are completely different.What is depression?Depression is a mental illness. It means for one: there doesn\u2019t need to be a certain reason for the depression. Actually, if you can find a reason to be depressed you\u2019re probably not depressed. All of those people talking about \u201cpulling themselves out of it\u201d were never depressed. They had self-esteem issues, or anxiety, or were just sad in general. Clinical Depression doesn\u2019t just \u201cgo away\u201d when people decide to stop \u201cfeeling oh-so sorry for yourself.\u201d That means that \u201cthinking positive\u201d and \u201cstop being negative\u201d or \u201cJust be HAPPY!\u201d Depression is not a choice, or a lifestyle. It is not something anyone wants to be. It is a mental affliction in where your brain is not producing enough chemicals to the point where it is physically, emotionally and mentally impossible to be happy. Okay. Got that covered. Why do people self-harm? People generally self harm when they\u2019re feeling numb and secluded. They haven\u2019t felt anything strong in a long time, except for maybe intense sadness and seclusion. They want to remind themselves that they\u2019re still alive, essentially. It\u2019s kind of hard to explain it to people that don\u2019t understand it, or have experienced it themselves. Okay. Now that we\u2019ve defined them (loosely). Depression and Self-Harm are completely different from being \u201cemo.\u201d And we really get annoyed when you guys say \u201cYou\u2019re an emo\u201d when I\u2019m actually just depressed, or the infamous \u201cHey guys look, I\u2019m emo!\u201d and then makes gestures of slitting your damned wrist. They\u2019re different. Depression isn\u2019t a lifestyle. Done. Stop. ",

            "answer_text": "I had to reply to this one and have never posted here before. I was emo most of my life, and no the wrist cutting is not a stigma, it\u2019s VERY there. I\u2019ve had many wise adults tell me there is always truth to every stereo type. No not all black people like fried chicken, but most admit they do and it\u2019s for historical and cultural reasons. African Americans used to fry chicken during the Slave era, and the tradition has stuck. The stereotype of depression and wrist cutting with those identifying as emo exists for A VALID REASON. Listening to rock music and dressing in black does NOT make you Emo. I listened to 70s pop like the Carpenters. Most of Karen Carpenters songs are depressing, listen to her voice. One is about dying and nobody really caring. THAT is some emo shit. I used cut my wrists for attention, blaming others for my problems like a whiny prick with everything handed on a silver platter. People in the 2000s saw a social crisis and made it into something \u201chip\u201d with \u201cEmo Hairstyles\u201d and \u201cEmo apparel\u201d which wasn\u2019t even a thing when the problem started. Why as a society would we do that? Because we as Americans are THAT dumb. Thankfully it\u2019s fading out as a stupid fashion scene which is what people made it become. People wore dark clothes because of morbid depression and self destructive tendencies, as psychiatric medications became proscribed at record numbers. Psychiatric analysts saw the Emo age emerge and warned parents that it was not normal. It was a way for those with low self esteem or identity issues to have some sense of empowerment. Injuring themselves was due to having an identity crisis itself and needing medical intervention. Instead it became glorified. We as a human society are mentally sick in the head for many other things as well. ",
