            "answer_text": "Misty Blue is a deeply personal \u2018torch\u2019 song about lost love and regret. It has been recorded by artists from various genres including jazz (Etta James) and country (Eddy Arnold, Billie Jo Spears). The most powerful and successful rendition was released in 1976 by the incomparable soul chanteuse Dorothy Moore. Her gospel-infused version went to # 3 on the Billboard Top 40 and #2 on the Billboard R&B charts. The song was written by the late Bob Montgomery who was a songwriting partner of early rock legend Buddy Holly. My mother LOVES this song. The meaning is \u201cI still love you but I sent you away and now I can\u2019t (for reasons not revealed in the song) have you back but \u201coh, I can\u2019t forget you\u201d (a refrain). \u201cJust the thought of you turns my whole world misty blue\u201d It makes me cry (misty) and profoundly sad (blue). Also, using a color, blue in particular for its symbolic meaning, makes a deepens the impression on the listener. Misty Blue is a true blue torch song from the jazz and blues traditions. But fact that it has multi-genre versions is a testimony to the power of the song and the writer\u2019s chops.  ",

            "answer_text": "Bob Montgomery originally wrote the song for Brenda Lee, recalling, \"I wrote 'Misty Blue' in about twenty minutes. It was a gift and it was perfect for Brenda Lee, but she turned it down. Her producer Owen Bradley loved the song and as he couldn\u2019t push her to do it, he cut it country style with Wilma Burgess.\" [1] Burgess recorded the song on March 24, 1966 at the Columbia Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. \"Misty Blue\" was released in October 1966 and spent most of December 1966 and January\u2013February 1967 in the top ten, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard Hot Country Singleschart. It ultimately became her highest-charting single. [2] The song spawned the release of Burgess's second studio album Wilma Burgess Sings Misty Blue in 1967. [3] Source: Wikipedia ",
