            "answer_text": "In other words, 3 octaves! To be honest, I would call that a toy. I've seen these sorts of affairs in Car Boot Sales in the UK, and they are invariably playthings for young children with no serious aspirations. They sell for about 15 quid (which I'm guessing is about 25 US dollars) for a reason. They're awful! I'm trying to be upfront, because I want you to ENJOY what you do and can't really see how you'll get any fulfilment out of such an unaspirational instrument.You see, part of the excitement in learning a piano is the POTENTIAL in the instrument itself! I remember as a young boy who could play by ear just seeing all those keys and wanting to explore them and make music with them!!! If you genuinely want to learn piano but are on a tight budget, you could consider the option of an HP arrangement and go for an acoustic piano (my local music shop does this for various instruments). There again, I have managed to find some perfectly serviceable acoustic pianos for beginners that were going dirt cheap, even free. I checked out a church piano (they were upgrading) offered free to any collector. My pupil got an instrument that had been regularly tuned (important to check, by the way); fine for a beginner. You should look out for possible bargains or freebies in your area (but take someone along who knows their stuff). If space is limited, then obviously you'll have to opt for something digital, but please look at something a bit better than 37 keys. Maybe 61 for now. I've seen these sold in Charity shops for 45 quid (what's that in dollars? About 70?). They have a degree of touch sensitivity as well. Get a pedal to go with it too. But whatever you decide, I wish you well! ",

            "answer_text": "Are you counting the black keys in the total? That would be about 3 octaves, which is okay for the preparatory and beginning levels. But quality over quantity is a very true idiom. Can this piano make loud and soft sounds\uff1f Can one hand play quieter than the other? Can you play grace notes on it? When you switch on to a real piano and start the intermediate levels, you will have no experience on how to make the quality of your music refined and exactly what you want it to be. And trust me, in almost every piece in the world, there is almost always a louder melody played by the right hand and softer accompaniment played by the left. There are tons of dynamics and little details you need to produce every second. See what your piano can play qualitatively, and then make your decision. ",
