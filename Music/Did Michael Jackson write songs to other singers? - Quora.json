            "answer_text": "Not that I'm aware of- in terms of his albums. He always gave a lot of credit to other musicians and artists of all kinds in interviews and at award shows. There were two instances when he wrote and performed two songs for two dear friends. The first was a song called \u201cYou Were There\u201d. It was sung live by Michael at Sammy Davis Jrs 60th Anniversary Special in 1989. It was a beautiful and heartfelt song worth listening to. Sammy was touched greatly by it. The second song was also written and performed live by him. It was in honor of Elizabeth Taylor. It was called \u201cElizabeth, I Love You\u201d. He performed it in 1997 at her 65th birthday celebration on ABC. As an adult, solo performer he didn't perform covers. The only song that I know of that he did renew was the Beatles song, \u201cCome Together\u201d. It was a very sexy and thrilling performance which is included in his Moonwalker film. But you can also watch it as an individual \u201cvideo\u201d. Let me know if you want me to put up the links for any of these. Enjoy! ",

But he did seat down, wrote and produced Centipede for his sister Rebbie. Night Time Lover for La Toya. ",
