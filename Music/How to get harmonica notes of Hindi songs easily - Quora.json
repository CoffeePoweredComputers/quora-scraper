            "answer_text": "You will find lots of websites where you can find harmonica notations in forms of numbers like 4B 4D etc. But I would suggest you to go for either Indian notations(sa re ga ma \u2026) or western notations(C D E \u2026). For Indian notations, you can begin with recognizing sa re ga ma in your harmonica and practicing a few ALANKAR SARALIES. Then you can easily play songs by reading notations from websites like Harmonica Notations and Hindi Bollywood Movie Songs - Indian & Western Notations. Good Luck :) ",
