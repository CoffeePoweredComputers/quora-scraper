            "answer_text": "Goodness gracious! Where to begin? While never coming across like gospel, U2 songs actually convey many spiritual ideas, many directly rooted in Christianity.   I can see how it could be argue that U2 is a Christian band.  They quote Scripture.  They talk about Jesus - constantly.  As a Jew, though, I feel it's essential to note that the spiritual themes behind the lyrics and music resonate across many faiths. \"Still Haven't Found What I'm looking for\" is a good example of such a song. Even though U2 makes Christian references all the time (\"carry the cross of my shame,\" \"I believe in the kingdom come,\" \"I have spoke with the tongue of angels,\" etc.) still, the music and the message transcend Christianity.  Even songs like \"40,\" which specifically reference \"the Lord,\" appeal to anyone feeling hope and struggle simultaneously. \"I will sing, sing a new song. I will sing, sing a new song. How long to sing this song? How long to sing this song?\"  In essence U2 music explores the ideas of struggle, illumination, belief and confusion in a cold and often lonely world. You don't need to be Christian to get it, and be moved. But you asked specifically about Christian references.  U2 - from early \"October\" to \"No Line on the Horizon\" is actually quite overt in its Christian view of the world.  The album \"October\" has many lyrics about the love of God, belief, afterlife, the love of \"he who made the blind to see,\" etc.  In \"Magnificent\" on \"No Line,\" U2 praises God and evokes straight gospel.  And there is everything in between.  References to Jesus, spiritual questing, and doubt - are all themes that span the decades of U2. But what makes U2 music a little unique in its Christian roots is the theme of doubt and darkness, which reverberate as strongly as that of hope and faith.  U2 comes into this fully by \"Achtung Baby.\" In \"One,\" Bono asks \"Have you come here for forgiveness, Have you come to raise the dead? Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head?\" On \"Acrobat,\" \"I'd break bread and wine, if there was a church I could receive in - cause I need you now.  To drink the cup, to fill it up, to drink it slow, I can't let you go.\"  Then there is \"Mysterious Ways,\" stating \"if you want to kiss the sky better learn how to knee On your knees, boy!\" \"The Spirit moves in mysterious ways.\"  But they beg \"Baby, baby baby, light my way\" over and over on \"Ultraviolet.\" \"Feel like trash, you make me feel clean, I'm in the black, can't see or be seen.  Baby, baby, baby, light my way.\"  Probably the most literally biblical song from Achtung is \"Until the End of the World,\" from Achtung Baby.  This song is about a fictional conversation between Judas and Jesus in the afterlife. It is chock full of biblical references, Bonified.  For example, \"In the garden, I was playing the tart; I kissed your lips and broke your heart.\" It's interesting how U2 is trying to see all angles of Christianity here.  Zooropa continued the theme of searching, and that of disillusionment.  In \"The Wanderer,\" written by Bono for Johnny Cash, U2 explores a feeling of searching and being lost, \"Jesus, don't you wait up.  Jesus, I'll be home soon.\" In \"The First Time,\" U2 discusses what it is to be saved, what it is to have faith, and throw it away at times. \"I have a brother, when I'm a brother in need. I spend my whole time running, he spends his running after me.\"  And, (\"father\" \"gave me the keys to his kingdom coming, gave me a cup of gold.\" Later, \"I threw away the key.\" Yet instead of succumbing to the darkness, U2 music speaks to solace in uncertainty. \"Don't worry, baby, it'll be alright, uncertainty can be a guiding light.\" Struggle and disillusionment with technology is another way to perceive the album.  On Pop, U2 continues to implore directly to Jesus, and keeps up the tone of doubt going hand in hand with faith.  They also seem to decide to embrace the glitter of the modern age, and give it a big fat kiss on the lips.  But man, are they still ambivalent. The struggle continues, and there seems to be a lot of anger here, too.   For example, in \"Wake Up Dead Man,\" the lyrics beg Jesus for help. \"Tell me the story, the one about eternity, and the way it's all gonna be.  Wake up, wake up dead man.\" On \"If God Will Send his Angels,\" it's \"God's got his phone off the hook, babe, would he even pick up if he could.\"  Tellingly, \"Jesus never let me down, Jesus used to show me the score. Then they put Jesus in show business, now it's hard to get in the door.\"  But as the band ages, a sense of healing is perceived.  By \"All that you can't leave behind,\" U2 is fascinated by grace, making peace - though it still mixed with doubt.  For example, even on \"Peace on Earth,\" the lyric goes \"when I look at the world, I think of you and your holy book, when the rest of us choke.\" That said, U2's recent albums have taken on a quality of praise and glory, such as in \"Grace\" or \"Yahweh,\" juxtaposed with the desperation of earlier music like \"Drowning Man\" on War.   Bono once said, and I'm paraphrasing, \"all the best songs are co-written by God.\"  I'm sure that U2 has provided comfort to Christians, but it has also provided Jews like me with a lot of comfort as well.  Despite the abundance of  Christian references, it is the exultation mixed with longing that defines U2 music - from \"Gloria\" to \"Walk On,\" and this resonates with the human condition - without qualification.

            "answer_text": "This \u201canswer\u201d actually means to clarify an important distinction that not many people (if any??) discuss or maybe even realize. As I read Ashley Sternberg\u2019s answer, I thought she was going to spell this out, but it didn\u2019t quite happen! A lot has been made since the band\u2019s early years about U2 being a semi-Christian band. Of course, they never technically fell into that category because there is a difference between a band of people who (mostly) hold Christian beliefs and a Christian-Rock band. So beyond that point, it\u2019s possible to draw out a myriad of references from The Bible, both in U2\u2019s lyrics and in Bono\u2019s many interviews. If you\u2019d like a complete list of such references, this page should be your very next stop (huge shout out to Matt McGee): http://www.atu2.com/lyrics/biblerefs.html But, and this is a big but, you need to revise your Question because it is fundamentally inaccurate: there is a huge difference between \u201cChristian references\u201d and U2\u2019s drawing of inspiration from \u201cThe Bible.\u201d Why? Because, there are TWO Bibles: The Old Testament (so-called)The New TestamentWhat Christians refer to as The Old Testament is actually the original Bible, the ancient Jewish Torah which long predates the Christian Bible. What I find fascinating about this subject is that Bono more often than not (although I haven\u2019t parsed this out to really compare) draws inspiration from the Torah. A few examples\u2026 The closing track from the War album is called \u201c40,\u201d inspired by Psalm 40 from the Torah.The 4th track from The Joshua Tree album, and the song which gave a title to that album\u2019s follow up, Rattle & Hum, was called \u201cBullet the Blue Sky.\u201d A significant lyric from that song is, \u201cJacob wrestled the Angel, and the Angel was overcome.\u201d From Genesis (the Torah):So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob\u2019s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. Then the man said, \u201cLet me go, for it is daybreak.\u201d But Jacob replied, \u201cI will not let you go unless you bless me.\u201d The man asked him, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cJacob,\u201d he answered. Then the man said, \u201cYour name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.\u201dLastly, Bono has said on multiple occasions that his favorite piece of scripture is Psalms, included in the Torah.So in conclusion, I\u2019d point out that if you are wondering what Christian references are included in U2 songs, you will only be getting a small slice of the whole pie!
