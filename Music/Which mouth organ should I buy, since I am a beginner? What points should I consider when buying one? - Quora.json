            "answer_text": "To answer the first part as you said you are beginner you should go for this: Tower chromatic harmonica  This is easily available in any local music instrument shop or you can buy it online (with trust) in around 4 to 5 hundred INR. It comes with a scale changer (though not much useful feature in beginning stage) and have a very smooth sound. Then you can upgrade to this: Hohner ocean star  Go for c scale hohner ocean start mouth organ. It is also very easy to play and have a bit louder sound then tower harmonica. This costs around 1k to 1200 INR. I have been playing for last 8 years with these two and hohner silver star (10 holes). Don\u2019t think much just pick one and start. Very easy instrument and the best part is portability. You can take it anywhere and impress or irritate people, whatever you will do you will enjoy. Cheersss!!!!\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "I had started with a hohner ocean star.  (Image taken from Google) I was a new learner and knew nobody who would suggest me. I just went in all the music shops of my city. All of them had only this particular thing in their shelves. So I just bought it and I am quiet satisfied with the ease of playing and sound of my mouth organ. I went on playing it and I had mastered my first song in the first week itself. Hohner ocean star is a C scale mouth organ on which many of the songs of Bollywood can be played (as most of the simple songs in India are in the plain scale. Its difficult to get out sharp and flat notes out of it) I have the \u201ckya hua Tera Wada\" fav in my list. It would cost it around 1000 rupees and it's something worthy for that. For any more queries you can leave me a message. All the best with your new buddy. :) These songs can be played easily on a C scale harmonica, my personal list  ",
