            "answer_text": "I personally only very, VERY seldomly use vocals of any kind, when I do, however, I find it easier to write music first, then lyrics and then add the lyrics to the track while also changing the track a bit around... having the music tends to help me get a 'picture' or just 'idea'... a lot of the more abstract names of my tracks also come to light that way. ...however, I know also enough other musicians who prefer it the completely other way around--and when remixing you are basically forced to do so--and people who simply write lyrics along with the music, and some who just change it up every now and then... Basically: there is no 'better', only 'whatever works for ya'. ",

            "answer_text": "I've always found it an interesting question. When I've written songs it always came to me in lyrics and I would hear the singing in my head. I would right down the lyrics and then after I was happy with the lyrics I would sing it to myself and somehow a melody would start to from around those lyrics. It's a very cool process. When I would work with other musicians on a song, it was best to have the lyrics completely done and we could collaborate on the music from there. It's easier to have the lyrics ready and collaborate with the music and melody aspect in my experience.  ",
