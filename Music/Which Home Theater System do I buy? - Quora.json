            "answer_text": "Source: BenQ W1070+Philips F5+Nvidia Shield TV(2017) = My Home Theater System As a movie buff, kicking back in the comfortable bed and enjoying the latest Hollywood blockbuster sounds like the makings of a perfect weekend.  Needless to say, home theater is a great way to bring the sounds of your favorite movies and television shows to home. Thanks to more affordable technology, home theaters are no longer only an extravagance for the rich, we can enjoy a true movie theater experience without leaving home. Yet the idea of setting up a home theater system is intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. Here is a way to get started. What I Get to Set Up a Home Theater System  \u270eBenQ W1070 Home-Theater Projector This 3D, Full HD, DLP projector stays in the budget line with a low price tag. It's as compact as ever: the off-white and silver projector measures 12.28 inches across, 4 inches high, and 9.61 inches deep. With its single chip DLP design, the W1070 is able to put out 2,000 lumens, which is more than enough to drive about any screen you might want, or to deal with some ambient light. It also has a mini lens shift, adjustable with a screw driver, which allows for a vertical projection offset between 110% and 130%. Yet this tiny lens supports only a little amount of optical zoom. This made it quite difficult to get the BenQ W1070 positioned in a helpful place in our room.  Besides, the W1070 certainly isn't delivering all of its claimed 2000 ANSI Lumens of potential brightness out through the lens, as I have seen an amount of light spilling out of these grilles. Moreover, although the sharp and clear picture impresses, but lack of subtlety in dark and murky scenes and motion issues does exist; while the deep blacks look satisfying, they\u2019re not forthcoming with a great deal of detail. in some scenes, low-level detail is swallowed up so much that you\u2019re left with patches of black that look more like silhouettes.  \u270e Philips F5 Detachable Wireless Surround Speakers The front speakers of Philips F5 feature detachable tops that can be used as rears at the back of the room. Simply detach the wireless surround speakers from the left and right main speaker units and place them at the rear of the room, then you can get a multi-channel surround sound experience with your games and movies. F5 is a cheaper version of E5. With a much lower price, its main body of each speaker is dressed in plastic rather than E5'wooly black cloth that wraps around its curved edges. Its size and sound quality also shrinks as well.  All of the AV connections are located on the back of the left speaker, and selection is generous. It includes two HDMI inputs and an ARC-compatible output, optical and coaxial digital inputs, a 3.5mm minijack input and a USB port. The wireless subwoofer is tall, narrow and can automatically connect to the mains when it is powered on.  All in all, the use of detachable wireless surround speakers is genius as you can whip them out when it\u2019s movie time then stow them away neatly when you're done. \u270eNvidia Shield TV (2017) This is the very device which has been in near-constant use at my home. This piece of hardware sits to the side of my television and serves content to my family quietly.  It actually includes a remote, many apps and capabilities, and it's adding new ones seemingly every day. Although it doesn't offer as many 4K/HDR apps as Roku devices such as the Premiere+, it has 4K where it counts: namely Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu and Google Play Movies and TV.  It also retains its heritage as a video geek's dream machine: it can output 4K resolution and even supports HDR (high dynamic range), NAS access, native Kodi support, Plex server capability, HDHomeRun integration and much more. The main interface is very clean and very fast. Apps are laid out in the traditional tile orientation with menus being very easy to navigate. In a word, it fulfills my needs, which includes watching TV and movies, playing local files, files from the cloud, and running streaming services. Thanks for reading.

            "answer_text": "A home theater is not just about picking the right design and the right brand of best high-end home theater speakers. There are many things that are essential to complete a home theater system. If you\u2019re looking forward to building one from scratch, here are a few important tips that will be of immense help to you. There are various home theater systems to choose from to get the best one for yourself. Although it is advisable that always buy the home theater system as per your room size not as per your fascination. Below are the top luxury home music systems and amplifiers: 1. Avantgarde Acoustic  Proudly taking its place in a legendary family of Hornspeakers - UNO, DUO and TRIO -, the SOLO is the first compact full range horn system from Avantgarde Acoustic for the Audiophile or the most demanding home theatre applications. The SOLO - with its graceful futuristic design - is a full-blooded member of the Avantgarde Acoustic family. That means you will get all the passion and emotional involvement that Avantgarde Acoustic are known to provide; precise reproduction, powerful drive, and involving dynamics. The SOLO simply sounds \u201clive\u201d. The thrill of listening to an Avantgarde Acoustic Loudspeaker is always guaranteed. The SOLO conveys that very special feeling. 2. Dream Vision: PHT W4 SUB speaker  The PHT-W4 speaker is a key element when it comes to watching movies, actions movies in particular thanks to its deep bass range of 30Hz - 200Hz. Since this subwoofer will be more than often installed in a living-room, it has also been tuned for listening music. The W4 will be particularly accurate for pop, rock, country or classic music. 3. Dream Vision  With the recent addition of uncompressed, lossless soundtracks, the audiophile criterias and requirements have risen. Add this to the fact that movies have a much more dynamic audio than normal music materials, it means that the PHT X speakers have to be able to accomodate larger bands from symphonic orchestras to hip-hop, or from total silence to earthquaking explosions and lightning crackles and bangs. Sometimes all this within seconds, if not in the same time. This requires power, sensitivity, dynamism and precision to play movies. Four qualities that describe the Dreamvision Uni-Axe\u2122 driver very well. 4: Audiophysic: AVANTERA III  Introducing the latest state of the art Loudspeaker from Audio Physics. Essentially the technology in the Avantera III is a trickle down from the flagship Cardeas 30 LJE in a smaller cabinet. In this third generation of Avantera, many of the proven aspects of other models have been incorporated, for example the HHCM III drivers from the Codex and the new HHCT III tweeter from the flagship Cardeas 30 LJE, new feet similar to Codex, redesigned crossover with capacitors from Cardeas 30 LJE and many more outstanding features.

            "answer_text": "Let me Google that for you:Home Theater In A Box System 2013 though their \"ratings\" of frequency response (\"low\" and \"high\") are not really about the neutrality of the midrange or SPL you can reach, so I'm not sure how they really compare in real life, it seems pretty arbitrary and based on manufacturer's specs on frequency response, which are widely variable in accuracy. It's also nice to compare remote designs and Blu-ray startup times per disc and at what distortion level those power ratings are measured - \" X watts RMS from 20-20KHz at 0.1% THD all channels driven\" would be considered real \"hifi\" (though hard to expect at this price level), whereas \"X watts at 10% distortion at 1KHz, one channel driven\" is pushing the limits of credibility and truthiness. Their comparison chart is useful as far as checking for inputs and wifi/bluetooth or Airplay capabilities, and you might even get Blu-ray within your budget (actually a good sign for decent audio circuits and upsampling of DVDs played). There are small remote controllable HDMI switchers for <$20 if that's the only limitation you run into, and it's good to check for HDMI 1.4 capability for Audio Return Channel from your TV being usable by the HTIB (Home Theater in a Box) - at least you know the amps and speakers are all designed to work well together, and their #1 pick is under $300 retail, so it's a good starting point for which models to eliminate, and which ones to research further...on Amazon, Newegg, Crutchfield, Best Buy, Sears, Walmart, Costco (check user feedback on each) or wherever you might be lucky enough to find them actually set up for evaluation (good luck on that these days). hope it helps!
