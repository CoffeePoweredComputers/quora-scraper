            "answer_text": "In the fall of 1972, fed up with in-fighting and an overall dysfunctional atmosphere in and around the band, Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan submitted a letter of resignation to management. Rather than try and talk him out of it, the managers agreed to let him go without issue under the condition that he honor the scheduled tour dates. These dates ran through to June of 1973. By the early 1973, Deep Purple had finally achieved the kind of success in the US (the biggest market in the world) they\u2019d only dreamed of. They had three albums (Machine Head, Made in Japan and Who Do We Think We Are!) on the Billboard charts at the same time. As their \u201973 tour wore on, their US record label (Warner Bros) decided to release a single from their VERY popular Made in Japan live album. In May of 1973, they released a 45 with an edited version of Smoke on the Water (live) with an edited version of Smoke on the Water (studio) on the flip side. On June 29th, 1973, Ian Gillan (and bassist Roger Glover) played their final show with Deep Purple. The two flew home to the UK battered and broken. Meanwhile, the song that had just been another song on their Machine Head album, one of the only tracks not tried as a single for that album (they\u2019d tried Never Before, Lazy and Highway Star without success) was steaming up the charts, eventually peaking at #4. Massive airplay of the single followed and as it went up the charts, it dragged Machine Head and Made in Japan with it. Four months after their last gig, Deep Purple had two LP\u2019s in the Billboard Top Ten, another hanging around the middle of the chart and the single was still on the chart after 12 weeks. So massive was their success that the band received the Billboard award for Best Selling Artist of 1973, outselling acts like Zeppelin, the Stones, The Who, Elton John, etc. Unfortunately, the band responsible for all that success no longer existed in that form. Gillan could NOT have chosen a worse time to leave and the band couldn\u2019t have made a worse decision than allowing that line-up to splinter. Keyboard legend Jon Lord lamented in numerous interviews before his death that the debacle in 1973 was the most tragic event in the band\u2019s long history. *sigh* What could and should have been\u2026. The sheer tidal wave of popularity swept the new line-up of the band into stadiums in 1974, but they couldn\u2019t maintain the momentum and it was all downhill from there. By early 1976 they were gone. Ian Gillan and Roger Glover both had long solo careers, but neither ever came close to the kind of success they\u2019d just missed out on in 1973. In fact, no one from the MkII line-up ever achieved anything close to that kind of success, even with the reunion of that line-up in 1984. However, to this day, it\u2019s MkII Deep Purple that remains the \u201creal\u201d Deep Purple and gets all the airplay on classic rock radio and their songs make up the bulk of the setlist in Deep Purple shows to this very day.
