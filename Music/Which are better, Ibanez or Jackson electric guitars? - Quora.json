            "answer_text": "jackson all the way. Ive owned 2 ibanez. Had a 1994 rg 550 my mom use to use in her band and a 1991 rg 770 but they had there problems partly cause of the age but they chipped really easy and the fretboards was easy to gouge after years of playing. Seems like almost every used ibanez i see online are always full of chips. My first jackson i ever played was a dinky dk2 and that guitar is beast and is still my most played guitar. The japanese made dk2 i have stays in tune really good and it don\u2019t even have a floyd rose just a jackson floating bridge. It never goes out of tune after 3 years(haven\u2019t even had to intonate it yet) and the stock seymours are really good for riffs. Only problem with the dk2 is that it don\u2019t have much sustain. Right now i own 4 jacksons(3 soloists and 1 dinky), a esp e-ii mystique, a cheap shecter omen-6 and a dean razorback. I might soon sell the esp mystique. the quality of that guitar in my eyes is not worth a third of what i paid for it and the ltd ec-1000 i used to own had way better quality. The dean i have is korean made and that guitar is flawless and so are my costlier usa jacksons. The fretboard on usa jacksons will never wear like a ibanez. the 2 usa jacksons i have has the grain on the fretboard filled in so you wont get gouging after the guitar gets a bit of mileage. Only thing i don\u2019t like about the usas is that they are a bit too heavy so i only play them sitting down. I also have a indonesian jackson soloist slx and despite being made in indonesia that guitar won\u2019t let you down, i swapped out the pups for sd blackwinters and now the thing is a beast. So from my experience get a jackson and the korean made razorback blew away my expectations as well. ",

            "answer_text": "The guitar that I gig with most often is a Jackson. That said, there\u2019s an Ibanez Premier on hand that plays wonderfully and has been used many, many times on stage. I like to gig with a guitar that is easily replaceable should I have to employ it as a weapon to fend off drunk unruly bar patrons. We live in an age where there are good value guitars readily available without having to give up your left nut. They both have what I would consider to be fast necks - Ibanez feels thinner while the Jackson uses a compound radius which I prefer the feel of. My preferences include: through set neck25.5 scalereverse headstocksblackpointy evil lookingJackson and Ibanez both can fill the bill in the $500\u20131000 price range. But sage advice says go play several of each to discover what suits you best as it is personal taste in the end. Enjoy your journey! ",
