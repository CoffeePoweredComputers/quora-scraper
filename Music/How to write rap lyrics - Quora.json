            "answer_text": "What is rap? Rap is poetry. You'll be amazed to know this, the biggest and most probably the greatest rappers are the greatest poets. What makes rap different from poetry is, the subject matter and representation of the subject matter itself, the elements like, punchlines, metaphors( poems do have metaphors, but they are artistic in the way they depict the idea or relation between things. Example: In poem \"Like a diamond in the sky.\" You know what poem that is. In rap \"...some how now back to the underdog, but no matter how loud that I bark...\" - Kings Never Die by Eminem Ft. Gwen Stefani. Hope you get the idea.)Well that's just one thing, there's a lot more to this topic. Now, one important thing I'd like to tell you is, you will try to copy the style of the rapper you like the most or the one who inspires you. You will. But don't worry, we all go through that phase. Because you will try and replicate the style and even ideas in your own work, because you want it to sound awesome just the way your favorite rapper does. It's like \"You write what you'd like to like.\" So, in the end what you've to focus on is, being yourself and pen your heart. In the end, your style or flow will be a fusion of your favorite artists, and thats when something new is born. I'll try to put down so points below, it'll help you understand the process. Listen Listen to a lot of music, try to appreciate it. And listen to every kind of rap music, like party rap, storytelling, gangsta rap etc. This way you'll understand the difference in various types of topics. Because, in the beginning, when you start writing, you will go off topic, for sure. Stay on the topic. When you listen, listen carefully. How the simplest of words are bent to sound like or to rhyme with others. Where they're put, and why does it have a ring to it. Write Write. Write a lot. The first bars you'll write will look like a poem, well, they should. You'll find it lame, but that's how it's suppose to be. You don't get everything in just one shot, first you need to do what's necessary. And there is no way around it. You'll find it tough, when it comes to the start, you'll be confused, more clueless, about 'where do I start'? But you'll soon come to the grips. Keep experimenting, write down complex rhymes, learn what syllables are. (Yeah, there is technical stuff too.)But you'll come around it in no time and you'll be amazed by your own rhyming skills. If something cool comes into your mind, but it is irrelevant with respect to the topic, don't force it in there. Never do that, instead write it down somewhere and make it a part of your arsenal.  Well that's not it yet, but this topic is temptingly vast. The more you get, the more you want it. But I hope it helps and good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on what exactly you want to rap about\u2026 I'm not going to dive into rhyme schemes and lyrical content, because that's a given for rapping and you can find plenty of input from other people on that subject. However, there's always a foundation to every rap song, and this consists of four central elements: Beat, Theme, Style, and Emotion. Beat: This is the easiest to find. Obviously, if you're dedicated to putting your lyrics to a song, you need to find a beat that suits exactly what you're talking about. If you pair a really aggressive and hard-hitting beat with soft, emotional lyrics, there won't be a relationship between the sound of the music compared to the sound and content of the lyrics. These are integral when it comes to songwriting. For example, imagine Yung Lean rapping to the beat of We Dem Boys. It wouldn't sound good at all, because Yung Lean lacks the energy to compliment the beat, and vice versa. Theme: The theme of your music is just as important as every other part. The theme is essentially, in simple terms, the single sentence that sums up your song. For example, if I wanted to sum up \u201cThey Reminisce Over You\u201d by Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth, I would say something like this: \u201cThe song is about Pete Rock paying homage to the death of Trouble T-Roy by talking about his own life experiences and the death of T-Roy.\u201d That is essentially the theme of the song by my own interpretation. So, if you were to want to write lyrics, this means they have to be both cohesive and complimentary to each other to fit within the theme of your song. So, before you even start writing lyrics, sit down and think \u201cwhat do I want my song to say?\u201d Style: This is what will either set you apart or throw you into a category as both an artist and a rapper. Think Lil Pump vs. NaS. Lil Pump is known for his attitude, hard-hitting and unique beats, and his outrageous yet comfortable and fun lifestyle. He conveys this over the beats he raps to despite saying very little on each song. NaS, on the other hand, is known for utilizing imagery and heavy descriptions of his life over well-composed yet gritty beats. He rose to fame because of how he painted the streets. These artists are two very different people, but if you were to ask someone to name a rapper from the 90s and one from right now, they would without a doubt be within the list of the most frequently chosen. Why? Because their style leaves an impact that is more significant than most other rappers. Of course, this is entirely subjective to each individual, but the point stands: style dominates who you are. And style covers everything from lyrics to instrumentals to even your clothes and origin. When honing in on your style, focus only on your lyrics and beats. Everything else comes naturally with who you are. Emotion: This isn't as critical as the other three, but it essentially plays into your style and choice of beat. You want to generally match the emotion of both the lyrics and beat you're rapping to. Learn your musical keys and how to determine the emotions of compositions. If you don't know your musical keys or their emotions, I recommend looking into them. Every key has an emotion assigned to it, and you can find beats in certain keys. But, to add onto that, your voice is the most critical tool in conveying your emotion. Play around with your voice until you find a tone and style that works to express who you are individually as an artist. There is a whole range of unique voices to be heard in Rap music ($uicideboy$, Lil Uzi Vert, Migos, Logic, Ugly God, Lil Peep, Lil Pump, Jay-Z, and Kanye West just to name a handfull). Get some inspiration and learn to express yourself in the most vivid way possible to compliment your overall song and lyrical structure. ",
