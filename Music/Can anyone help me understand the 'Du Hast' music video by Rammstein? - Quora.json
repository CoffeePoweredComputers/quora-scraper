The lyrics are based on a tonal match of the words \"hast\" and \"hasst\". \"Du hast\u201c means \"you have\u201c \u201cDu hasst mich\" means \"you hate me\u201c This ambiguity is used in the text. Similarly, the two words at the end of the lyrics: \"scheidet\u201c and \"Scheide\" \u201cWillst du, bis der Tod uns scheidet, treu sein?\u201c means \u201cDo you want to be faithful until death separates us?\" \u201cWillst du, bis zum Tod der Scheide, treu sein?

The boyfriend kisses her in what may be his final moments as he is dragged away by the assailants and into a barn. After nightfall, she witnesses the horrible scene of (she thinks) her boyfriend having been set on fire and running across the padddock to his death. Next morning, the suited culprits appear in a \u2018Usual Suspects\u2019 slow-mo march toward the car. She must be terrified. But then, her boyfriend appears within the group. He gives her a steely look as they all proceed, without delay, right past the car. When at a safe distance, the boyfriend checks his watch as, on cue, the car and his girlfriend are blown up. The cuckolded boyfriend\u2019s ruse to get the disloyal member of his group and his philandering girlfriend to this remote spot has succeeded. In her final moments the girlfriend must have put two and two together and understood that she had been found out. Mission accomplished. ",

The guy with the gun voted for the gang (Rammstein band members) against his partner who he kills with the car bomb in the end (which means, it was his plan before entering the barn).  The text corrolates with that. Central question is:\"Willst du bis der Tod euch scheidettreu ihr sein f\u00fcr alle Tage\"is a question of marital fidelity \"will you be faithful to her til death do you part?\" and the answer of the singer is \"NEIN\"  - \"No!\" ",
