            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019m not a piano player, but I have a couple of good stories on the subject. The Sound Can Be As Good So, right out of college, one of my good friends \u2014 a guitarist and keyboard player \u2014 started working for one of Ray Kurzweil\u2019s companies. Kurzweil was a pioneer in many different areas in those days, including speech recognition, electronic book reading, and electronic pianos. Kurweil himself is a pianist, founded Kurzweil Music Systems in 1982, and worked with people as varied as Stevie Wonder and Robert Moog on his ideas for digital pianos.  The Kurzweil 250, released in 1984, was the first keyboard/synthesizer to pass a \u201cblind\u201d listening test as a piano. Experts and pianists were unable to identify the difference between the K250 and an actual piano in listening tests. Obviously, these were not conducted standing next to each instrument! So that was the absolute state of the art in 1984. The best piano emulations have only got better. The Kurzweil piano used a sophisticated piano model. Some later sample-based models actually recorded 3 or 4 samples per per key. Some more recent keyboards use physical modeling of the different strings, hammers, physical modeling of the various resonances in the piano\u2019s sound board, etc. These include the Yamaha VRM Clavinova, the Viscount PHYSIS, and the Pianoteq plug-in for your PC DAW (which offers models of specific pianos, including two licensed and approved Steinway models). The Experience\u2026 Maybe Not So Much It\u2019s quite different, in a number of ways, to the piano player.  Here\u2019s my sister Kathy\u2026 she started playing piano at about six years old. She majored in piano at Oberlin. She\u2019s not a working pro, but she usually plays in a couple of serious bands in the Princeton, NJ area. She\u2019s got several pianos: a full Yamaha 88 key keyboard, a smaller Nord, and the big one, a 1950s restored Steinway Grand. That Steinway cost more than I paid for any two of my cars. It\u2019s not simply the sound that one can record from such a piano \u2014 as I expressed, that can be done with synthesis that\u2019s good enough that piano players can\u2019t tell the difference. But the sound you hear live, the sound you hear while playing, the action of the keys, etc. that all adds up to very different experience for the piano player. In fact, Kathy worked pretty hard to convince herself that a nice new Yamaha or maybe Bechstein would be \u201cjust as good\u201d. She spent quite some time trying other instruments, but wound up convinced that it was the Steinway or nothing. You May Have Already Been Fooled! So, if you attend music concerts, you have probably seen a pretty hot show that slows down for a bit, to feature the artist in some big, emotional song that really needs a Grand Piano.  Some years back, a friend of mine was working as Bass Tech for a famous rock band (not Ms. Stephani here), and I was invited to sit on the bass cases on the stage and watch. You\u2019d probably know the band. It was an absolute blast! And yeah, while most of the show was guitars, drums, bass, sax, and pretty rockin\u2019, there was the Grand Piano in the Spotlight moment. Even from stage, where you don\u2019t necessarily get the best mix, it sounded great, every bit that dramatic moment they were after. Once the show was over, I was fascinated watching my buddy and the other roadies back up several semis worth of gear, including stage scaffolding, instrument cases, amps, speakers, etc into multiple trailers, all in about 1/2 hour. And one of the big surprises was when they went to the grand piano and extracted the keyboard \u2014 some high end electronic piano \u2014 from the grand piano shell. Sure enough, I had been completely fooled. The goal, of course, was not to be fooled, but just to deliver the best possible sound with reasonable effort. If you\u2019re watching a concert by a famous classical pianist at a place like Carnegie Hall, there\u2019s a really good chance that\u2019s the House\u2019s very expensive Steinway they\u2019re playing on. That instrument would be tuned regularly, of course, but it\u2019s also just not being moved all the time. But places like \u201cThe Spectrum\u201d in Philadelphia (long gone, but that\u2019s where I saw this particular show) don\u2019t necessarily have instruments, because rock bands bring their own (my buddy was managing about 10 different bass guitars). So it would be insanity to load up and move a real grand piano for every show. It would likely need retuning all the time, and all that travel would just be terrible for it. Recording It, Versatility, and Conclusions The other thing about electronic pianos\u2026 they\u2019re super easy to record. The sound comes out on a cable, in stereo. I can plug that directly into my 16 track digital recording system. If it\u2019s a real piano, yeah, it can be recorded. I\u2019d like about three mics near but not too near to different parts of the soundboard. It\u2019s just more work, and the result, if I did well as an amateur recording engineer, is that it sounds as good as the electronic piano. And of course, that really expensive Steinway sounds like\u2026 a really expensive Steinway. That\u2019s great, when you need one. But what if you need a Hammond Organ? Or a Harpsichord? A church organ? Or something more suited to country or rock-and-roll? Your keyboard is a dozen or more instruments. Ultimately, most people can\u2019t own all of those instruments.  I had the same issues to consider when buying electric guitars. I have one Les Paul, and a few fairly generic amps, but if I wanted a specific guitar sound, what do I do? A professional may not have this problem \u2014 certainly, Slash can afford all the guitars he\u2019d like to afford. But that\u2019s also his full time job!  For me, while I do own one Les Paul and a few acoustics, the answer was the Line 6 Variax (mine is the JTV-69 shown here). This guitar doesn\u2019t model the actual guitar string sounds, but it has digital processing to modify that sound. So it can model the sound of other guitars. Very precisely model other guitars. And in fact, it makes recording pretty easy\u2026 its model of a Martin D28, for example, is so much easier to get right than micing my own Martin D16, that if I\u2019m recording something, I\u2019ll probably just use the Line 6. And while this version is a good guitar, as with the pianos, playing the JTV-69 is a completely different feel than playing the D15. It\u2019s understandable that Martin still sells plenty of guitars, but I can\u2019t justify the cost of a D28\u2026 and what if I want the sound of a Gretsch, a Rickenbacker, a Stratocaster, or a Danelectro next time? Line 6 also does the same thing with modeling devices that emulate specific amplifiers and speaker cabinets. Just as with my guitars, there\u2019s also your practical budget. You can buy a Yamaha XF keyboard/synthesizer for as little as $3,000, and their licensed Steinway Model L piano model for $50. The actual model L weighs 650 lbs and can easily run you $40,000 for a used, reconditioned piano. You\u2019re going to need to have that piano tuned and serviced at least twice a year, or you are not treating it right, and it will in turn not deliver the sound you want. Can you afford that real piano? What if you only have $3,000-$4,000 to spend? You can have a very accurate version of the Steinway Model L sound, as well as all sorts of other piano and instrument models on the Yamaha synth. Or you can buy a used Baldwin upright or Yamaha Console piano. When it\u2019s in-person, and especially when you\u2019re playing, the experience of the real piano will be superior to that of the electronic piano. But in more practical terms, if you\u2019re not getting that real piano tuned and serviced at least twice a year, you are not treating it right, and it will in turn not deliver the sound you want. For most people, the electronic piano or synthesizer is a better option, and much easier on the wallet. So in conclusion, yeah, electronic pianos can substitute for real one when it comes to recorded or amplified sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Good for what? Here's an unquestionably great piano:  The Fazioli F308. This instrument is a 10ft 2in grand piano. It costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $140,000. It's GREAT. If you were in the room while it was playing, it would send shivers down your spine. Let's say for the sake of discussion that it's the best piano in the world. (This is just an example. The B\u00f6sendorfer Model 290 Imperial has 97 keys and will run you between $250k and half a mil, depending on options. Maybe it\u2019s the greatest piano in the world. I don\u2019t know. There are others. Let\u2019s just go with this one.) How well does this instrument fit your needs? Do you have room in your place for a 10ft-long grand? Can you afford to spend $140k on a musical instrument? You'll probably also need to buy & install a humidity management system for it, to protect the investment. And the instrument will need tunings: let's say twice a year, under the assumption that a beast like that isn't too temperamental. I don\u2019t know what a Fazi tech charges to come tune; but I bet it\u2019s more than the local guy charges to come tune my little 40yo spinnet. The best instrument is the one you can get, that you will actually practice on and play. If you're a student in a dorm; or if you live in a one-bedroom walkup in the city; or if you're an active-duty serviceman; or you\u2019re constantly moving around for work; then the great Fazioli F308 isn't worth a damn to you. You can't afford it, and you have no place to put it. It\u2019s legitimately great, but you just have no use for it. Even a poor-quality digital would be superior FOR YOU. That's an instrument that you could actually live with and practice on. In an ideal world, a \"real\" acoustic piano is better in many important ways than a digital. You'll develop a finer touch, a better feel for and understanding of key weight and decay/sustain, etc. To develop into the \"ultimate\" player that you might someday want to become, you'll need to do some work on an acoustic. But. What if you can't get an acoustic into your home this year? Will you ultimately be a better player if you wait to start until \"next year\" when you can finally house an acoustic? Or two years on? Or maybe it'll really be five years? The best instrument is the one you can get, that you will actually practice on and play. If you're a teenager living in your parents' house, and they won't buy an acoustic; but you have a couple hundred saved up now that you can use to buy a decent digital that you can keep in your room, plug headphones into and practice silently \u2014 won't you become a good player sooner, if you start now, with the instrument you can get and use? Maybe a digital will just be your \"starter\" piano, and someday you'll want to move on to an acoustic. Maybe: but there's no benefit to waiting, potentially years, until you get the \"perfect\" instrument before you start learning & practicing. You can start learning notes and fingering and scales and rhythm and sight-reading etc etc etc, NOW. Maybe you won\u2019t get as good as you would if you were practicing on a real piano; but you\u2019ll be much farther along than you would be if you didn\u2019t start at all. Sure, you may need to fix some areas of touch & technique if/when you switch to an acoustic; but you\u2019ll still be learning and improving. Heck, if you'll only be playing in an 80s cover band, maybe a digital is the only thing you\u2019ll ever need. :-) Think about your home and your habits and your life, and get the instrument that best fits into that. It could very well be a digital. Maybe that instrument won't be good enough for a Vladimir Horowitz to come practice on; but it still might be the best for you. Whatever. Don't let some preconceived idea of \"best\" be a barrier between you and starting to learn & practice & play. ",
