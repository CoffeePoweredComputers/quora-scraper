            "answer_text": "A five album run is a lot. To craft one great album is difficult enough, so five in a row is a mighty challenge. However, I can think of a few groups who may have done just that. Granted, I\u2019m a fan of all the groups I\u2019m about to mention, so I may be biased here, but I\u2019m trying to be as objective as possible as a critic. Also, while I do enjoy multiple genres of music, heavy metal will always be my first and foremost, so my picks are going to skew on the heavy side. That said, I believe there\u2019s some gold here, so let\u2019s check them out. Black Sabbath- Black Sabbath, Paranoid, Master of Reality, Vol. 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Man, the first five Sabbath albums have some incredible material on them, and they are pretty much all complete albums, offering great tracks with little to no filler. Definitely check these records out.Iron Maiden- The Number of The Beast, Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. I think you could even include their self-titled debut in here, but that album is disconnected from the other five by Killers, which in my opinion is slightly weaker than its predecessor. These albums contain classic material, and it is these five essential Iron Maiden records that have cemented them into the Heavy Metal legends. Amazing work by an amazing band, don\u2019t miss any of these records!!Metallica- Kill \u2019Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, \u2026And Justice For All, Metallica (The \u201cBlack Album\u201d). What can you say about Metallica\u2019s first five offerings other than that they have truly defined this band\u2019s career, and in doing so, have elevated the Bay Area thrashers to the top of the thrash-metal heap. The progression of this bands abilities, particularly from their iconic debut to the masterpiece Master of Puppets, is unparalleled. Each record was more nuanced and sophisticated than the last, and in short time they grew a tremendous amount, thanks in large part to the late, great, Cliff Burton\u2019s contributions and knowledge of musical theory. Some may argue that the lack of a definable bass sound on AJFA, and Metallica\u2019s breakthrough into the mainstream with their \u201cBlack Album\u201d is enough to keep them out of the upper echelon occupied by the first three, but let\u2019s be serious. AJFA is a masterpiece as well, incredibly unique in their discography as their most progressive work, and the Black Album is heavy as hell, with some of the best production you\u2019re likely to hear on a metal record. Legendary stuff.Rush- 2112, A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals. Ok, this is 6 great albums in a row. Is it any wonder that this honor belongs to Rush, the band behind only the Beatles and The Rolling stones in terms of total albums sold? You\u2019ll find some of their strongest material on each of these albums, and very little filler. Their technicality and virtuosity is mind-bending, and perfectly show-cased on this sextuplet of satisfying records. So many amazing songs can be found on these. The Overture of 2112, Xanadu, Cygnus X-1, Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, YYZ, Subdivisions. And these are just the \u201chits\u201d of these albums; the deeper cuts offer just as much musical mastery, and every one of these albums should be listened to with full-attention, from front to back. This band is truly in a league of its own. I\u2019m a huge fan of progressive music from the 70\u2019s ever since I remember my father rocking out to Pink Floyd, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Blue Oyster Cult to name a few. Oddly enough, he wasn\u2019t the biggest Rush fan, having only a Greatest Hits album of theirs. But as I\u2019ve grown familiar with their discography and really discovered and fell in love with them on my own, they\u2019ve emerged to me as the greatest prog band to come from that era, eclipsing even the mighty Pink Floyd, who held those reins to me for a long, long time. So sad to say, but rest in peace Mr. Neil Peart. We lost a legend with your recent passing, and it\u2019s hard to fathom the finality of Rush\u2019s departure. Exit the Warrior indeed, a true Farewell to a King.Baroness- Red Album, Blue Record, Yellow & Green, Purple, Gold & Grey. The most recent band on this list, Baroness started as a sludgy, prog-tinged metal band out of Georgia. I immediately fell in love with Red Album as soon as I heard it, and by the time Blue Record came out, I was completely blown away by how much the band matured and progressed it sound. Then they released Yellow & Green, a sensual, 70\u2019s rock style double album which offered some of their lightest, airiest, and sweetest sounds up until that time. It\u2019s a true masterpiece, and one I revisit often. Following a bus accident while on tour that severely injured members of the band, they returned a few years later with Purple, coming back with a harder sound again that I can only imagine was influenced heavily by their recent near catastrophe; Purple, the color of bruises. This album contains, in my opinion, their greatest individual song, the sprawling, melancholic Chlorine & Wine, a gorgeous tune filled with emotion that shouldn\u2019t be missed. This year they returned with yet another beautiful collection, the majestic Gold & Grey, an album that encapsulates all of their past efforts while continuing to push their sound into new territories. It\u2019s also rumored to be the record that concludes their colored themed albums. If this is true (and actually they\u2019re running out of colors to pick from, though I\u2019m personally hoping for a \u201cWhite\u201d album), it\u2019s going to be strange to see an album with Baroness\u2019 name on it and a \u201cnormal\u201d title. But, if their past work proves anything, it\u2019s still going to be amazing. In addition to being the primary song-writer and life blood of the band, singer/guitarist John Baizley also does the amazing cover art for all their albums. Go check out Baroness, they won\u2019t disappoint!Honorable Mentions: Death- Spiritual Healing, Human, Individual Thought Patterns, Symbolic, The Sound of Perseverance. Tool- Undertow, Aenima, Lateralus, 10,000 Days, Fear Inoculum Well, I went a little bit more than I expected there, but for good reason I believe! I give all of these picks my personal endorsement, and if you\u2019re a fan of metal/hard rock, or just good music in general, check these out!! ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the others who\u2019ve cited Bob Dylan and Creedence Clearwater Revival for their awesome five-LP runs. In fact, I think Dylan had another blazing 5 album stretch that starts with Time Out of Mind and extends through Love and Theft, Modern Times, Together Through Life, and Tempest (if you skip over his Christmas covers album). But I would like to add Elton John to that mix. With the introduction of his beautiful Tumbleweed Connection, he began a streak that was tough to beat. Cause next came the great Madman Across the Water, Honky Chateau, Don\u2019t Shoot Me (I\u2019m Only the Piano Player), and his masterpiece Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. The next LP after that, Caribou, wasn\u2019t all that great, but it was just a rest because another masterwork Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy hit the next high spot. John ruled over the 70\u2019s. In an era that heralded the end of the LP as a complete unified statement, Radiohead came with its own amazing 5 album streak. With their debut, Pablo Honey they made a statement that elevated alternative rock to new levels, and they followed up that statement with The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A and Amnesiac. They have since produced terrific albums through the last decade that are rich and transcendent. So they have my vote too. But you asked for the greatest five album run ever. Well, it\u2019s the Beatles. Start with Rubber Soul, groove through Revolver, revel in Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts\u2019 Club Band, clap along with Magical Mystery Tour, and then dig into The Beatles (White Album), and you have traveled through an evolution of the long-playing disc from a platter of entertaining music to a form of high art. Some might argue that Magical Mystery Tour shouldn\u2019t count, since it\u2019s an amalgam of songs from the TV special and other hit singles released separately, but all the songs hold together well and have influenced so much music then and since. Some might ask about adding Abbey Road and Let It Be, but the inferior Yellow Submarine stands between them. These five albums of the Beatles were revolutionary for their excellence and stretching of the genre, and they established the boys as something more than a rock band. They were artists. ",
