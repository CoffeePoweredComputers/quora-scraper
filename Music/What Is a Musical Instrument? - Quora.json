            "answer_text": "Have you ever heard of John Cage\u2019s works? He was a mid-twentieth century experimental composer who asked a question similar to this. His thought process probably went something like\u2026 What can be considered music? If music is just a series of sounds then technically, by a stretch, couldn\u2019t the sound we hear everyday be music? And if the sound we hear everyday is music then isn\u2019t everything a musical instrument? Is there no limit to what is music? If we just sit down and listen to our surroundings then aren\u2019t we listening to the music of the universe? *puffs joint* The answer to your question is a subject of debate still because a lot of practical musicians might say, yes but not really and a lot of experimental musicians will say yes, anything is an instrument. Now, being a practical musician, I will give you my answer: Yes. Everything can be used as an instrument because everything makes sound however we shouldn\u2019t consider everything to be an instrument by default From a practical stand-point a musical instrument is something which is intentionally used to create music. They key is in the word \u2018instrument\u2019: Noun: a tool or implement, especially one for precision work. So in my view, cars whizzing past outside or footsteps outside are not instruments because they aren\u2019t being used intentionally to create music however the minute someone starts to use them specifically for the purpose of making music they become musical instruments. Objects and sounds are not instruments by default but become instruments the moment you intentionally use them to create music. They become instruments of sound production. Tools for the composer to create. ",

            "answer_text": "Anything that makes sound can be a musical instrument. Typically, musical instruments have a range of pitch, articulations and timbre that add to the colour that is music. Though, I joined a musical improv group whose motto is basically \u201canything goes\u201d. Ive had people in the group bring bicycle wheels, pillow forts, heck I even brought in a horse mask for the recording. You\u2019d be surprised how intense the music sounded with typical and non typical instruments alike. I recall reading/seeing a video of one lady who made music in a subway station with a saw blade of some sort and it sounded pretty awesome!  ",
