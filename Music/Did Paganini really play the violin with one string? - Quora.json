            "answer_text": "Yes. Here is the story of how he began composing pieces for a single string (always the G string, the lowest of strings on the violin). He was, for a time when he was young, head musician for Napoleon\u2019s sister, the princess of Lucca, Italy. He fancied a young woman, and with this in mind wrote a piece called \u2018duetto amoroso\u2019 (love duet) in which he took off the two middle strings, leaving the highest and the lowest, which represented the female and male respectively. He told a love story on these two strings, which everyone in the audience clearly understood. Following this, the young woman said to him, \u201cif you can do that on two strings, I\u2019d like to see what you could do on just one\u201d. He then composed his first piece for the G string, the Napoleon Sonata. He went on to compose many more, the most famous of which is the Moses variations. It was commonly said that he was much better on a single string than any other violinist on all four. With the use of harmonics, he expanded the range, pitch-wise, of the single string beyond that of a normally strung violin using regular notes. ",

What an unfortunate accident, but instead of stopping, he would continue playing on the remaining three strings. Then his A string would break. What are the chances of that? But he continued playing. You get the idea. Finally his D string would break, and he would finish the concert on the G string. It\u2019s not known is this is true, but Paganini did compose pieces to be played only on the G string. Here is his Moses Fantasy performed by Antal Zalai on a violin with only a G string.  ",

Sometimes he would arrange for one or more of his strings to break so that he could finish whatever he was playing in an even more amazing manner. But he obviously couldn\u2019t play a lot of his music on one string. One thing he did so was to tune his violin backstage in secret to a higher pitch than normal so that no one could figure out how he played certain pieces. ",
