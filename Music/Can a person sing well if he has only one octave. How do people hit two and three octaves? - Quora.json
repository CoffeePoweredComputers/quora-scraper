            "answer_text": "You didn't specify where in the world you are. Answering your first question, for Western classical music, you would find yourself limited in the written music you sing. You might find that  jazz and folk music work pretty well for you however.  People do increase their ranges. Most singers benefit from lessons. Some singers found that lessons were harmful to their voices and they needed as many years to heal the larynx as they studied with someone who taught bad technique - hence, do not believe someone is a great instructor because you know or spoke with someone who has studied years with them. I never trusted that as a recommendation when I was a student, but more as  a reflection of the student's traits.  I strongly advocate not giving up your power, i.e., your judgment, to anyone, including music teachers. Always challenge them. Those who don't like challenges will either be the wisest and in demand (and if they are Old World, impatient) for that reason, or they are winging it - which can work, but voice is rather more subtle than an instrument in terms of tone production, and there is the possibility of injury if the instructor errs. A small number may be right about what they teach, but unsure about why. So, use your best judgment. Especially in vocal production, if it feels good physiologically, the chances that you are damaging your body are less than if it hurts or feels like a strain that is too great to manage in one step. That missing step could be the clue that your teacher is unqualified for the task s/he is attempting. If you have a sensitive ear, which can be developed just by listening to lots of classical music, then good vocal technique will manifest in a richer and purer tone very fast, if not immediately (assuming you are indeed using the technique).  As you might by now judge...I recommend not trying to improve your singing on your own , but just enjoy it on your own. If singing feels good, do it. If it hurts or feels uncomfortable, play it safe. Your state of being will make a  huge difference too, in your technique, in what you hear, what you like, and in the tone itself. Center your energy in your heart - the one in your chest. Ground yourself. If that doesn't make sense, get a voice teacher who knows what it means. ",

            "answer_text": "One octave is not bad for a non-singer. Neither lower nor higher extension. Three octave singers are fooling themse;ves. Two is perfectly normal. Any more is fantasy induced by the proximity of the microphone. There's a register change in the middle of the voice that is probably stalling your sensitive soul. An octave up from what is probably your lowest note at the moment. Most singers transit this block very quickly without even noticing it. The problem comes with the secondo passaggio at about top F#. This register modification is rather more difficult and this is where many pop singers resort to falsetto. To do this is a woosie way out of the difficulty. With training, sensitive vocal modification of the velum and bucal tuning, you can enter a fine head voice if you persevere. That should give you a strong two octaves free of pain and filled with pleasure comensurate with that of sex. For women, I'm not sure. ",

That being said, having only one octave can limit your song choices quite a bit. I\u2019d suggest going to a good vocal coach to get proper training - most trained singers can get up to two to two and a half octaves, with a select lucky few being able to get up to three or more.

            "answer_text": "I have a lot of notes from baritone to soprano. No one would want to hear a female baritone. Those low notes are placed in head resonance so that I can make lower mid range notes richer, and high b flats fuller. It\u2019s what you do with that voice that is important. I had a student who had no head resonance at all, but when she sang \u2018 besa me mucho\u2019 people would stop and listen. I was in awe. Hitting a high note, like the penultimate b at the end of una voce poco fa is difficult. It takes effort and confidence and an awful lot of scales. ",
