            "answer_text": "Two things you can't really compare\u2026 In live music you have a bunch of musicians, possibly nervous or best excited, who stand in front of a different sized different excited crowd and interact with them, play for them. The. Listen closely to each other and the chance is that something special happens which will never happen again as all the little things work together and build a very special situation in which possibly music magic happens. Or it goes all wrong and they play like crap as the audience is bored, they have been in a 4 hour traffic jam, the flight was delayed and the guitarists most beloved guitar has just been stolen\u2026 A lot of random aspects. In the studio you hopefully have a calm atmosphere where the musicians can cooperate with the recording engineer and producer to from a diamond out of a piece of coal, which was a nice sounding song they wanted to become something very special. A lot of detail work - thinking, talking, trying, overthrowing goes into that one track. The same track where just say 5 minutes are spend on in the live situation. I have no idea what's better :) Say an artist does not feel comfortable playing in front of an audience, just he/she has to to make money and promote the recordings - the recorded music might be better. Say an artist is live like Muppets Animal and loooooooves to play live and make a descent show until he has no power anymore and the audience is totally pleased - then the live music (including the show) might be a lot better. I don't even talk about the technical aspects which make it even more different. The are both very enjoyable :) From both sides of the stage ;) ",

            "answer_text": "I think you are trying to compare them, and, at least in a modern context, they are VERY different art forms. Live music is about the moment. It is about years of preparation meeting a instant that comes, goes and moves onto the next instant. It is about contact between the performer and her audience via the instrument and the music, and colored by dozens of other factors (sound system/acoustics, lighting people running systems, fellow audience members, comfort of the environment (though some performances can be enhanced by discomfort). It can be beautiful, or it can be a job: a single moment for the audience, but one of about 50 or 500 of the exact same, and utterly forgettable moments for the artist and sleep-deprived crew, or it can be, for some reason, a unique and memorable moment for the artist too, a \u201cmilestone\u201d or \u201cvery last time\u201d, as when The Beatles performed in Candlestick park that day or on the rooftop some years later. In fact The Beatles are a great illustration of this comparison. They (so the story goes) realized in the mid 60\u2019s that they wanted to do things musically that really could not be reproduced on the stage. In fact, the studio itself became another instrument to them. Their producer (George Martin) became an INTEGRAL if not often enough credited member of the band. That is the thing about REALLY great artists. They differentiate the two forms, treating the live as one thing and the recording as another. Prince was PHENOMENAL at this. His live performances were performance art, the several of which I saw will live forever in my feeble mind. His albums still move my aging, fairly fit, but still \u201cdad-ish\u201d body every time I hear them. To tie this all together. Look up the performance that Prince took part in for the George Harrison (one of the Beatles, if you don\u2019t know) induction to the R&R Hall of Fame. I don\u2019t think he sings a word (though Tom Petty, RIP, does), but his guitar solo is haunting. Oh, and since it was recorded, we get to enjoy it again and again. As a consumer, I try to enjoy the immediacy of a live performance that are unique, and do the same for detail-oriented perfection, (or conscientious lack thereof) entailed in recording. Finally, I reject the argument that \u201canybody can do anything\u201d in a recording, therefore it is somehow a less pure or valid art form. It is true that a recording is a product, often a highly produced one at that. But when I listen, I am consuming THAT product, nothing more. I really don\u2019t care about how talented (or not) the named artist is, I only care about the product, in the same way that I don\u2019t care if it Steve Jobs built my iPhone himself or hired 1000 engineers to do the job. What I care about is that it works. That is not to say that there isn\u2019t a LOT of bad art out there. I just choose not to listen to it. The badness of an individual recording does not detract from the art form itself. ",
