            "answer_text": "'Cause We've Ended As Lovers by Jeff Beck on the Blow by Blow Album. the cover artwork shows him playing a Les Paul, but as far I know he used a Tele on this track. If you haven't heard it you're in for a treat. Edit: Thinking about Beck and the Tele, check out Jeff and Clapton on YouTube doing Further On Up The Road from the Secret Policeman's Ball around 1981. Eric does his usual thing but Jeff produces a hair-raising, exhilarating couple of solos, made me laugh out loud with joy first time I listened to it. ",

And, as already mentioned here, the Stairway to Heaven solo. Danny Gatton is probably the guy who extracted the most from the Telecaster, though he is not as known as Jimmy Page by the general public. ",
