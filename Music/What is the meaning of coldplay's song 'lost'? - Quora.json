            "answer_text": "Lost! is one of the songs which never really got the attention it deserved. Though critically acclaimed, it didn\u2019t stay with the masses for long. It\u2019s a beautifully and thoughtfully written song demonstrating Coldplay\u2019s ability to give simple lyrics very articulate meanings.  Source The song has vocals by Chris which seem to have a bit of regret and frustration in it. The church organ all through the song sets a gloomy theme. The song starts of with the lines Just because I'm losingDoesn't mean I'm lostDoesn't mean I'll stopDoesn't mean I'm across Just because I'm hurtingDoesn't mean I'm hurt This is referring to the ups and downs faced by people. Each one of has been on Cloud 9 at some point of time, and has been in a very unhappy or depressed state at some other point of time. The lines convey that even though things are going downhill, it doesn\u2019t mean that everything\u2019s lost. A small hurdle on the track does not mean we\u2019ll quit the race. A small roadblock does not mean we\u2019ll end our journey. The next 3 lines are pretty interesting. Doesn't mean I didn't getWhat I deservedNo better and no worse This is somewhat to convey that these times of unhappiness and distress are not something we blame on our fate or fortune. It doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t get something we didn\u2019t deserve. It\u2019s all a part of life and we can\u2019t really do anything about it other than fight and rise above it. Complaining about whether we deserved it or not is a completely futile exercise. I just got lostEvery river that I tried to crossEvery door I ever tried was locked These lines just talk about how even after trying everything, they did indeed get lost. All the hurdles they tried to cross, all the roadblocks they tried to cross, they couldn\u2019t save themselves from getting lost. Ohhh and I'm...Just waiting 'til the shine wears off \u201ctil the shine wears off\u201d is an idiom which in a general case refers to something getting old. In the context of this song, it means we need to wait till this downhill period of our life is over. Many times it\u2019s just time that can fix things, and no amount of work or effort put into it can change the circumstances. You might be a big fishIn a little pondDoesn't mean you've won'Cause along will comeA bigger one These lines probably analyze how we got into such a situation. The culprit was complacency. Using the fish as a metaphor, it\u2019s conveying the idea of never being complacent in your small world because there\u2019s always a possibility of someone better than you living out in the big world. We need to be alert at all times. We can think about this in terms of kingdoms. A king might consider himself the biggest fish of his small kingdom (small pond), but there might be another king with an even bigger kingdom and army out there waiting to take over this small pond. A main theme of Coldplay\u2019s \u201cViva La Vida Or Death and All His Friends\u201d was kingdoms, kings, people and the dynamics between them. And you'll be lostEvery river that you tried to crossEvery gun you ever held went offOhhh and I'm...Just waiting 'til the firing stoppedOhhh and I'm...Just waiting 'til the shine wears off These lines are a continuation from the previous ones. It\u2019s the aftermath of letting your guards down, primarily because of complacency. If we follow the recurring theme of the kings and kingdoms, once invaded, the king of the smaller kingdom doesn\u2019t have much option but to wait till the firing stopped. But this mistake is not the end, you just need to let time take it\u2019s toll and then rise up again. <There\u2019s this awesome guitar solo here which really blends in with the theme of the song.> Ohhh and I'm...Just waiting 'til the shine wears offOhhh and I'm...Just waiting 'til the shine wears off And the music fades out \u2026  The same song can mean different things to different people. This is what I interpret the song as. There have been many versions of this song, Lost? which is a piano version of the song and Lost+ which is a collaboration with Jay-Z . Source for Lyrics ",

            "answer_text": "It is a song about being positive and being humble. It means to convey that everything is transient and your current situation does not decide your life overall. You might be winning or losing this very moment, but it won't last. Nothing lasts. He says about being hurt and being lost, but only for the time being, the current failures do not mean that he hasn't or wouldn't achieve what he deserves. Similarly, someone might be a big fish,(metaphorically happy or strong), but even that won't last. And he manages to keep a sane , stable mind despite his current circumstances. ",
