            "answer_text": "Good answers before me. Yes, these are all considered neotango/nuevo tango groups. If you ever have the opportunity to attend a live concert by any of them, do not hesitate to go. Tanghetto and Otros Aires are wonderful; Bajofondo gives the most unforgettable live performances. I would recommend you seek out a lesser known American alternative ensemble, Mandragora Tango Orchestra. Some other enjoyable, lyrical, eminently danceable neotango songs are: Daniel Garcia Quinteto - a fantastic version of Eleanor Rigby Craig Einhorn - Milonguea Del Ayer Jose Alberto - And I Love Her (a magnificently romantic latin-inflected arrangement that is a special treat on those rare occasions when tango DJ\u2019s deign to play it for us to dance to) Alacran - Reflejo de Luna ",
