            "answer_text": "I answered this before on Quora.Arthur van Strien's answer to How much data is consumed for 2 hours of a YouTube video? This was the answer: I downloaded a 4K youtube video the other day for offline watching. It was 17 minutes long and takes 2.17 GB of space. For the sake of science I downloaded another two 4K videos from Youtube. One was 5:33 long and takes 590mb of space on my drive. The other was 5:41 long and takes 713mb of space on my drive.Note the space difference here despite being about the same length. Now some math: 2170 (mb) / 17 (minutes) = 128mb per minute.590 / 5.33 = 110mb per minute.713 / 5.41 = 131mb per minute. 128 + 110 + 131 = 369 / 3 = 123mb on average per minute with these 3 videos. This is of course not a scientifically correct number but will give us a rough idea. 123 * 60 = 7.380mb per hour (7.4GB)123 * 120 = 14.760mb per two hours (14.8GB) Wow, I did not expect such a high amount of bandwith usage per hour when watching Youtube videos in 4K. But with the amount of pixels, send over to your device at 30 frames per second, it is a realistic number. Overall on 4k, or UHD to be specific you display a whopping 248.832.000 pixels per second on your screen. The answer above was only for 4K resolution on Youtube, but it shows that the data used differs a lot per video. It is not possible to just give a number that tells you how much data is used by watching Youtube videos. It is possible to give a rough average number on how much data will be used by watching Youtube videos. That would be ROUGHLY: 4k: 7.4 GB per hour.1080P: 1.85 GB per hour.720P: 820MB per hour.480P: 340MB per hour. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no difinitive answer. Amount of data consumed is directly proportional to the resolution of the video as well as the contents of the video. But the question here asked is about HD quality video only. So I will talk about that only.It can be as low as 4MB/min or as high as 10-12MB/minute if you are watching HD quality video. It depends upon what is inside the video. The contents of the video. It depends on the data needed to present the video i.e it's contents.So a song will have more audio data then a movie scene or a tutorial. A video with more objects/colors will have more data than a video with less objects/colors. So a scene in a crowded marketplace will have more data than a scene in a room. A video with rapidly changing scenes will have more data than a video with comparitively longer scenes. A new frame with in same scene will require less new data than a new frame with completely different scene. A video with frequently changing scenes will have more data than the one with a lesser frequency of scene changes. So a scene in a discoth\u00e8que will have more data than a scene in which a news reader is reading a news. So it is a combination thing. There are multiple factors and its a combination of all those factors. ",
