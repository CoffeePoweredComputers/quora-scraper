            "answer_text": "From the 1930s to the 1960s, it was very common for a movie that ran well over two hours to have an intermission. The Sound of Music ran for almost three hours and it would have been difficult for an audience to sit all the way through without a break for food or a bathroom. In addition to The Sound of Music, I remember going to see \u201cThose Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines\u201d and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d during that era, and they both had intermissions too. Nowadays, theatre owners are a lot more concerned about theatre turnover than they are about customer comfort, so the intermission is pretty much a thing of the past. ",
