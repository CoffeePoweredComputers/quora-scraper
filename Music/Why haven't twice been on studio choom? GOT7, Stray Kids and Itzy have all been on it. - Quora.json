            "answer_text": "Well I noticed groups like Twice, Red velvet and BTS haven\u2019t been there. Maybe because groups go there to promote themselves but these groups I listed already have stable fanbases and are already popular enough and promote somewhere else. For example Twice promotes in Japan, BP and BTS promote in America and idk much about Red Velvet but they surely promote somewhere else too! Hope that helped ",

They already have stable fanbases and going to such channels will not bring them anything they don\u2019t already have. ",
