            "answer_text": "Musicians (I\u2019ve heard about) that have been forgotten as time went on include: Laura Nyro  A Singer-Songwriter whose career started in 1960s Manhattan, she was idolized by well-remembered pop music icons such as Elton John and Cyndi Lauper. She wrote numerous hit songs for pop musical acts such as the 5th Dimension (\u201cSave the Country\u201d, \u201cSweet Blindness\u201d, \u201cStoned Soul Picnic\u201d), Three Dog Night (\u201cEli\u2019s Comin\u2019\u201d) and Barbra Streisand (\u201cStoney End\u201d, \u201cTime and Love\u201d). In between hiatuses as well as raising her son Gil (aka musician Gil-T), Laura had continued to record both studio and live concert albums until 1995. She was later diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer in late 1996, passing away from the disease on April 8, 1997 at the age of 49. Rotary Connection  A psychedelic soul band where pop/soul singer Minnie Riperton got her start singing with a vocal range that spanned 5 octaves. The band not only recorded and released six albums but also worked as backing musicians and vocalists for prominent Blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Howlin\u2019 Wolf. After first disbanding in the Mid-1970s, they recorded new material (along with hip-hop band The Roots and rapper Chuck D) as part of the 2003 PBS documentary series \u201cThe Blues\u201d. Steppenwolf  (lead singer and band leader John Kay)  A Canadian-American rock band who rose to fame in 1968 with the song \u201cBorn to Be Wild\u201d. The song ended up being used in countless movies such as \u201cEasy Rider\u201d and \u201cRecess: School\u2019s Out\u201d. This rock band ended up disbanding for the first time in 1972 after a Valentines Day concert in February of that year. They ended up reuniting and splitting up two more times. Their second run was from 1974 when they signed with record label Mums Records to the fall of 1976. A whole bunch of Steppenwolf tribute bands were doing concerts between 1977 and 1980. Their third run started in 1980 when lead singer John Kay had a meeting with concert promoter David Pesnell regarding management, producing a new album and promoting concerts for the original Steppenwolf band. John Kay ended up being the only original member to stay in the group until their final concert (and subsequent retirement) on October 14, 2018. Strawberry Alarm Clock  (guest singer Greg Munford in 2007)  Best known for their 1967 hit song \u201cIncense and Peppermints\u201d, which was not only the title track to their album of the same name but has also been featured in countless movies and TV shows such as \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d, \u201cRecess: Schools Out\u201d and \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d. The lead vocals on \u201cIncense\u201d was actually sung by a guest singer named Greg Munford while the band sang background vocals and played instruments. Strawberry Alarm Clock first disbanded in late 1971 after having conflicts with record labels and each other over musical direction. They had a brief reunion from 1974 to 1975 and performed the theme song to the ABC musical TV show \u201cABC in Concert\u201d. They then reunited again in 1982, having recorded new material, re-recording older material and doing concerts ever since.

            "answer_text": "There isn' t one, there are tons! One of my pasttimes is going round second hand bookshops and rummaging through old music. I never cease to be astonished by all the names that I' ve never or barely heard of who nevertheless managed to get their music published (and presumably performed) back in the day. A relative who used to work in the BBC music library once told me that he had never realised that there were so many composers! Apparently, the BBC gets inundated with scores that they don' t even bother to look at. In other words, if you are looking for musicians that time forgot, they have always been around and always will be. Some of them must also have had Wagnerian egos. You must have to write 32 symphonies of monumental proportions as Havergal Brian did. Few give a damn today. ",
