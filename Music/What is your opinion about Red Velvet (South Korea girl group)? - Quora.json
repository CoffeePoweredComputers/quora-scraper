            "answer_text": "Red Velvet is an amazing group. I don't really care if you agree cause it is simply my taste and opinion. Actually there are a few opinions about the group and I would gladly want to gain explanations from fellow reveluvs on this. 1. Irene, Yeri and Joy have a weird tension. Hear me out on this, Idk whether they always have interacted like this but recently I have been noticing them getting very weird or awkward around each other, by recently I mean since the past year. Idk why but it feels like one of them did something to the other and they are on bad terms in some way 2. Irene is close to Seulgi and Wendy It is kind of obvious, I have never seen Irene get touchy like with hugs and stuff with Yeri or Joy, she tends to lean/hug Seulgi and Wendy a lot, again it could just be because of the age gap but referring to my first point, I feel there's some tension among Irene, Yeri and Joy. 3. Seulgi isn't a very out and about kind of person She seems quite silent on reality shows and stuff, she seems to be very interactive only when she is really interested in whatever is happening or which has one on one interaction. Like on Hello82, when Irene and Seulgi were meeting a fan as a surprise, Seulgi was super interactive and talkative and kept the fan engaged compared to her silent demeanour on variety shows 4. Irene is super clever and mature, which people don\u2019t notice or see Irene is super competitive which makes her quite attractive in my opinion plus her way of talking makes me think that she is mentally much older than she is physically and she seems to get a hint on how to act and interact with others pretty easily. 5. Yeri is just an extra member in RV for SM ent. Honestly the way Yeri is treated by SM makes me think that she is not really taken as seriously as she is supposed to be, like to elaborate, she is hardly given lines, she is never the center in any of the choreographies, which really makes me think that they just added Yeri to RV because they didn't know what to do with her until the next GG debut(which hasn\u2019t happened yet plus even if it were too, she would be much older). 6.RV is a group of random girls, completely unplanned Seulgi trained under SM for 7 years because there was no GG to debut in, Irene was selected for her Visual initially and tbh despite training, her talent doesn't even come out much because of her rapper position in a non rap focused group. Wendy looks like someone who would have been a soloist under the label and Joy just felt like she shouldn\u2019t have debuted at that time- she was a baby. As per again my previous point, Yeri too feels pretty off as per how she was added a year later. To me RV seems like a random shuffle game of the girls being put together and surprisingly they just worked out well. SM should be grateful. 7. Don't feel annoyed by Reveluvs when they say that SM doesn't promote them I apologise if you aren't a reveluv and you feel annoyed hearing this, RV is genuinely mistreated by SM. Exo gets a lot of attention from their company and so does NCT, infact they experiment so much with NCT like making sub groups and stuff that it makes me feel like they are only interested in them and not in RV at all, there is almost zero content of RV despite having such amazing musicality. It is like the ignored sibling among the other groups, whatever success RV has got is soully because of their talent and nothing else. 8. Red Velvet isn\u2019t going to last in the long run with SM The girls have been able to go along and still get recognition because of their constant potrayal of talent, Pyscho was genuinely the song where all members were able to shine, I really can\u2019t imagine them lasting any longer than that, even if they would have to- they\u2019d have to do something extremely unique/eye-catching to last more. I always get this gut-feeling that they are going to disband soon and do their own solo stuff. Now they could only last if they were promoted well from their initial days, because of lack of promotions they will probably won\u2019t last. ",

            "answer_text": "Red Velvet is my ultimate girl bias group, so these are just some of my honest thoughts as a fan ever since about 2015. I\u2019m not sure if these are unpopular opinions but here goes: Wendy has a long way to go to being being the top vocal of SM. I thought that Wendy was going to be that vocalist. I thought that she\u2019d be the next voice of SM\u2019s female artists. But the thing is, after Red Flavor and watching her live performances, it seems like her voice has gotten weaker. Some of her of belts aren\u2019t sustained, and I\u2019m actually not surprised, considering how she was the unhealthiest during that comeback. To me, the top female vocals of SM are sill Taeyeon and Luna. Maybe with more experience and time, Wendy can continue to improve and train, but as of right now, I still think Taeyeon and Luna are some of the best yet.Irene is the ultimate visual of the third generation girl groups. I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I just think that Irene\u2019s visuals are well-praised because they\u2019re conventional, fit the Korean standards of beauty, and hard to hate on. That makes her a well-received person based on her looks. She\u2019s been given so many CF deals, praises on shows and in real life by fans for her face, and I personally agree. She\u2019s my bias in the group and Baechu knows how to work it!Seulgi and Joy make up the stage presence of Red Velvet. I\u2019ve seen mutiple fancams of each of the members throughout all of their comebacks, and Seulgi and Joy seem to stand out the most to me. Both of the have gorgeous figures that allow dance moves to look chic, smooth, powerful, and sexy if that\u2019s even possible. Both of them seem to take the music and complement it with great facial expressions that hard carry the group. Though Wendy, Yeri, and Irene do have their moments, something about Seulgi and Joy just makes my eyes wander to them almost every time.Their voices get nasally in many songs. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a stylistic choice or if their voices have always been this way, but for me, Seulgi and Yeri\u2019s voices have always sounded nasally. I personally am not a fan of nasally voices and prefer more light and warm vocal timbres. Even Wendy can get nasally at times, especially during their live performances, but I guess it can\u2019t be helped.Wendy\u2019s yo-yo dieting is dangerous and is affecting her vocal potential. When I saw her during Russian Roulette, my first impression was, \u201cWoah. She lost a lot of weight. Is she okay?\u201d And when she lost even more weight during the Red Flavor era, she was the skinniest that she ever was. When I saw her perform live, she would sound very weak in her belts, breathless, and she just looked so frail. I remember Ailee talking about eating 500 calories a day to lose weight, and when she did, her voice changed so much that she didn\u2019t like how she sounded at all. So she gained more weight so that she could sustain her belts and so that her voice sounded healthier. Same with Luna from f(x). She explicitly stated that she gained some weight ever since her 4 Walls era so that her voice would be more powerful for her solo debut. Wendy\u2019s the type to lose weight very easily, and each time she does, I feel like her voice becomes more and more fragile and less like how it was before.I prefer their Red concepts over the Velvet. I may be the only one to say that I like their pop and funky songs, but it\u2019s true. To me, that\u2019s the popular way to define Red Velvet as a group. They\u2019re quirky, experimental, energetic, and confident. Sold. Even though I\u2019m in love with their Velvet side songs, I can\u2019t resist their iconic bops like Dumb Dumb, Rookie (I know, don\u2019t clip me for liking that song :P), and Really Bad Boy. Oh yeah, and Peak-a-Boo and Bad Boy were the perfect marriage of Red + Velvet. Just sayin\u2019. (UPDATE: THEIR NEW JAPANESE TRACK, \u201cSAPPY\u201d, IS GIVING ME MAJOR \u201cDUMB DUMB\u201d VIBES!)If they keep on having frequent comebacks, their popularity will not decline. Right now, Red Velvet and EXO are SM\u2019s stable investments. They\u2019re groups with songs that do relatively well each comeback, they maintain pretty frequent appearances in the industry (which I love from SM), and even if their \u201cpeak\u201d was already reached, that doesn\u2019t mean that their popularity will plummet. If anything, it will probably be stagnant, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. You could interpret that as Red Velvet doing well each year ;)They do concepts like no one else in the K-pop industry. They\u2019re one of those experimental groups that aren\u2019t afraid to try anything and everything. Red Velvet has done, peppy, girly, girl-crush, summery, chic, ballads, funky, and so much more. But the difference between them and some other groups is that Red Velvet actually pulls off each of these concepts successfully. They\u2019re able to fit every realm of ideas put out, and it looks natural on them. That\u2019s pretty rare in the K-pop industry, so I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve been able to do well.Their b-side tracks in all of their albums are top-notch. Some companies put all their effort into their title tracks and have b-sides as loose filler to make up a mediocre album. But for me, Red Velvet\u2019s b-sides are just as captivating as their title tracks. Every time they comeback with another album, I\u2019m so tempted to buy it because every track is gold. But sadly, I\u2019m broke, so no K-pop albums for me :(There is no \u201cbad\u201d Red Velvet song. That\u2019s right, I think that none of the Red Velvet songs are bad. They\u2019re quirky, catchy, skillfully crafted, and have unique instrumentals that keep me on my toes 24/7. I\u2019ll admit, there have been some songs where I wasn\u2019t sure if I was vibing with it, but after a few listens, I always fall in love.Irene has the visuals and dancing abilities, but not necessarily the stage presence. Irene is kind of like a doll. Sometimes, she can be lively, but in many of her fancams, especially when a song has been out for a while, she can be out of it.  These are just a few of my thoughts on my favorite girl group. I don\u2019t want this to come off as hate, but just a few things that I\u2019ve noted to myself within the past couple of years. Here\u2019s to 2019 and hopefully another great year with Red Velvet and ReVeluvs! ",

            "answer_text": "There are good answers to this already so I guess I should be thankful I was requested? I don\u2019t have too many, since they\u2019re probably my favorite third gen girl group, but here are the few I have. Ya\u2019ll hating on Yeri too much. There are senior artists who have complimented her for her voice and her self-written/composed songs, and told her that she was underestimating herself. I know that she doesn\u2019t have the best stage presence, but she\u2019s improved, especially this year. I wish people would give her a chance.Irene may not be much more than the visual at first glance, but she\u2019s an integral part of Red Velvet. Do you really think the group would have been the same without her?Because of her \u201cgodlike\u201d visuals, she has been able to promote Red Velvet all over Korea with commercials and ads. She\u2019s the mother of the group, who always takes care of all the members, and her members in turn love her very much. She\u2019s such a caring person and I feel like there\u2019s hate against her for no reason other than \u201cshe\u2019s pretty,\u201d when in fact she\u2019s also the lead dancer, center, leader, advertising head, and loving mother of the group.Their versatility is amazing, but they haven\u2019t done every single concept to ever exist in the K-Pop world. (I\u2019m not saying that they have to in order to be a good group, I\u2019m just saying that people claim they have even though they haven\u2019t.) In their title tracks, they\u2019ve done mature sexy (Bad Boy), cute, playfully sexy (Peek-A-Boo), and badass, but they\u2019ve never done girl crush or what I call the \u201cfresh youth\u201d type (GFriend type songs). This is probably because none of the members have the \u201chard voice\u201d needed for a girl crush song. Wendy and Seulgi are amazing vocalists, and Joy has also improved a lot. But that doesn\u2019t mean their voices are as fluid as their concepts. For example, someone I would say has a \u201chard voice\u201d is Soyeon from G-Idle, or Jennie from BLACKPINK. They have the type of voice that can handle those girl crush songs, but Seulgi has a very flowing, kind of nasally voice and Joy and Yeri have very high pitched or light, airy vocals that wouldn\u2019t suit the song.I will say though, they are so far the most versatile girl group I\u2019ve seen. Their ballads are also incredible and always a treat to listen to.Wendy is not the best vocalist. There are people I\u2019ve seen comparing her to Chen (EXO) as his female version, but no. She still has to improve more on her vocals until she reaches that level of stability and technique. I do love her voice, however, and I hope that she gets to showcase it more.Seulgi is not the best dancer of the third gen ggs. I actually can\u2019t choose a \u201cbest dancer\u201d due to my lack of experience in the field, so I hope no fanwars erupt in the comments while speculating. Her dance moves are effortless and fluid, but they aren\u2019t as powerful or hard as, say - Hyoyeon. I know it comes from her experience in the industry as a senior artist and all that, but their styles are very different so it\u2019s not quite a good comparison. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that her dancing can\u2019t portray everything.There is not a single \u201cbad\u201d Red Velvet song. Surprised? Yeah, I even liked Rookie, Power Up, and Really Bad Boy. Their versatility has allowed them to take on concepts or song styles never done before in the K-Pop industry and I have a lot of respect for them.The \u201cIrene hates men\u201d trope has become a way to attack her, but it\u2019s really just an inside joke from the Reveluv fandom and I can\u2019t help but sigh in disbelief and disappointment when people take it seriously.She doesn\u2019t glare at every male specimen that looks her way, unlike what some antis seem to have gathered. Watch the Super TV episode with SuJu and Red Velvet. Watch her interactions with EXO, TVXQ, and NCT. This might also have to do with the fact that the groups are from her company, which inevidently means that she\u2019d be closer to them than groups from other agencies. Some people just aren\u2019t comfortable with strangers and it takes a while for them to open up. It\u2019s well known that Irene is introverted.They get hate for literally no reason.Those are all my \u201cofficial\u201d unpopular opinions, though I\u2019m not sure if all of them are actually unpopular. On a lighter note - I didn\u2019t like Bad Boy as much as most of the K-Pop fandom did. I did like it, but I prefer Red Flavor and Peek-A-Boo. I think it\u2019s because I found it too repetitive for my tastes, but this is just my personal opinion so just ignore it. Red Velvet is an amazing group. They\u2019re all so funny and talented in their own ways. My bias is Seulgi, comment yours down below :) ",

            "answer_text": "So I am not a stan but I have few hope it\u2019s enough since it was requested ;) 1.Seulgi is the star of the band-not only that she is one of the best female dancers today but her presence man, it's fierce I remember watching her with Taeyeong and even though MR. TY is one of my ults I could not take my eyes off her she is a star.  2. You don't appreciate Yeri not even near enough as you should-she writes songs for other artist and she is so talented, people step on her all the time she does not deserve that she is doing an amazing job and she is so young.  3. Irene doesn't hate men- what's wrong with ya'll did you see how she looks at Jackson Wang? No I am kidding but for real though she is a type that is not open with guys or maybe a type that holds to herself that does not mean that she hates men in any way I am not stan or there from beginning but as much as I know she was very shy at the being even having insecurities about her Daegu accent so give her a break with that.  4. Wendy is not the best vocalist of this generation-I heard that some people call her female Chen like sis no we are not gonna do that. I'll admit she is very talented but compare her to vocals like EXID's Solji or even someone new like Loona's Haseul she is not stunning. In current popular gg settings, she is the best she is better than BP's Rose and Twice's Jihyo for sure. Also, I think that she is problematic but not as problematic as people love to present her biggest fault IMO is the fact that she did not apologize for her mistakes, but it's not all on her Korea is not really awake in every possible way.  5. They don't need to rap-they are not good. Why does SM force rap on them when it's not in their nature? 6. Bad Boy is their best title track-say what you want but that song is art. Most of RV songs are pop hits this one stands out; it's very unique and different.  7. I don't see Irene's role in band-visual and leader OK but were on earth is her talent? Like in music? She is not the best dancer, she is not a vocalist either and her official title \"main rapper\" is kind of ridiculous. Her visual game is strong but her stage presence is not IMO.  8. Joy is most lovable one-it's just so easy to love her and her charisma is out of this world.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yeri was never mean to be part of Red Velvet. Being young wasn\u2019t the reason for her to not debut. Lots of SM artists debut under the age of 18. Moreover, Automatic was recorded at when Joy is around 15 y/o (Seulgi and Irene danced to it when they were still in SMROOKIES). If Yeri was supposed to be in Red Velvet in the first place, she would have also recorded with them. They also sometimes overlapped Yeri's part when they aren\u2019t supposed to, because those meant to be their lines at first. And then we have SM who aren\u2019t dumb. They have had so much dramas that year to bring more hate to their new group. It's obvious adding a new member will get hates, and why would SM do that? Obviously not because they can't wait for their new girl group member to turn 18. You can defense she is in Happiness MV, but so is other SMROOKIES members, it wasn't meant to prove anything. And a blank spot on Wendy's part Shine on me was simply how the choreography works with 4 members. The number will always turn odd. Joy also revealed she was stressed when Yeri joined because she was supposed to be cute, but now it's Yeri's job and she has to think of something else to pull out. Think about it, if Joy known about Yeri joining she would have had something in mind before.Seulgi and Wendy suits every single Red Velvet concepts. Yeri has this very cute look for her to be girl crush style but then Irene has this mature look to act forcely acting cute. Joy used to be in cute, but imo it didn't even fit her well, which explains why she can't go back to it once she had already switched to sexy. That's why she fits Velvet side way more.Yeri saves Red Velvet. Yes she isn't the most talented member, and SM only started promoting Red Velvet after her joining, but she and Wendy is literally the reason why i watch game shows with Red Velvet. They both make everything so funny and entertaining to watch. Try Knowing Bros with Red Velvet, Yeri brought the vibe, that's why I believe she was a great add to the group and she deserved to be treated so.Wendy is underrated. Everyone knows how amazing she is at singing, but what about others? She was the worst dancer in the group back in 2014, but the 3rd best dancer after RBB era. She improved, a lot. She also have potential of being at least lead rapper, but being the main vocalist doesn't allow her to. Search up Red Velvet Wendy rapping, that girl is literally amazing but people just don't know.Irene is a great leader despise her not talking a lot. She doesn't bring the vibe to everyone, but she always is the most caring one. I have watched too many Red Velvet game shows to name when Irene secretly share the loser\u2019s treat. She always is the one carrying the most when they are on the trip, and she tries not to cry in front of everyone. She is trying her best and deserve the love.Joy is not okay. This is extremely unpopular, but I feel like I'm the only one who feels that. I know she always look so positive, that's why her stage name was Joy since the first place. However, remember how she collapse in Happiness perfomance? It was confirmed it wasn't electric shock, she just is scared of those fireworks and those are big fears that reached to a point of her collapsing. She looks like she was going to cry yet she continued perfoming. I feel like she had faced something really bad to reach her to that point of scaring. Moreover, she looks very tired in a lot of perfomance. Just take a look at Umpah Umpah or Zimzalabim, or even Psycho, and compare that to enthusiastic Red Flavor Joy. She looks like she is out of breathe sometimes and I feel worried about her. I feel like it was from the Media School she was in (which said that had been doing bad stuff to the students and was exposed around 1-2 years ago), but it\u2019s just my thought. Netherless Joy isnt ok is a fact and we should start caring about it.Red Velvet MVs are underrated. Just because they don't look fancy like Blackpink doesn't make them bad. They contains lots deep meanings and I enjoy watching them the most in the whole Kpop.Their choreography are god-tier. Other than Yeri never been able to center, other members all had their epic moment and are able to shine. I dont know why people think those are bad, they are just very complicated but awesome, they stand and sit on stage in a lot of perfomance. They switch spots very often and their moves arent repetitive (which is why in Weekly Idol at Random Play Dance they kept not knowing their spot since they werent sure which verse is it). I love the Dumb Dumb dance, the ideas and everything.Although Yeri is not untalented, she never shined and we have to admit it. The only song she ever shines to me is the rap in Peekaboo, and that's it. She never stands out in almost every songs, and her vocal nor rap nor dance is the strongest in the group. She was more of the vibe add that SM decided to do on Red Velvet, not the talent add. In some way i sort of feel bad for her, she would have shined in other groups.Red Velvet has very few stage prescense. Not no, but very few. Again i would have to nominate Son Seungwan and Kang Seulgi for this position, as those 2 are the only ones with good stage prescense. Joy doesn't, and as I mentioned I think that kind of relate to her health issue as her prescense was very good before. Irene, it is her personality, but as an idol i do think she should change, altho she never did and probs never will. Yeri i dont know how to say it, but i partly feel like its her lack of confidence. She mentioned she isnt a very smiling-person. She is often described as having a mad face before debuting, which is why i think she isnt very comfortable smiling all time during perfomances. But i kind of think she should. One of the rare time when her stage prescense is good, check out Talk To Me stage.",

            "answer_text": "I truly believe Yeri was never supoosed to be part of RV. If you watch their predebut dance of \u201cAutomatic\u201d, the dance was very obviously made for four. The audio wasn\u2019t actually the official \u201cAutomatic\u201d song and OP just edited it in. You can tell cause the dance isn\u2019t always in sync and you can sometimes see Irene or Joy singing Yeri\u2019s part. When that video first came out, I wondered what SM\u2019s true plans were for RV since I really believe they would\u2019ve had a more mature sound and probably would\u2019ve stuck to the red vs. velvet sound. I also wondered if Yeri would\u2019ve been a part if SM\u2019s NGG, and how maybe waiting would\u2019ve brought her so much less pain and hate.HOWEVER\u2026.I think Yeri was a great and important addition to the group. Her voice is very unique, and I never truly respected it until I heard her in the ReVe Festival Day 2 album. Her vocals are INSANE and give their songs so much richness, especially for their Velvet songs. It reminds me of honey since it\u2019s very smooth, and it contrasts well with Joy\u2019s fresh vibrant vocals. Now that doesn\u2019t mean she has the best technique since I think she can still work on that, but I can\u2019t imagine RV\u2019s songs without her. Also, her presence in variety makes a difference. All the members\u2019 personalities bounce off each other so well, and Yeri\u2019s youthful, carefree energy gives the older members a lot to work with.Speaking of vocals, I think SM should stop giving Yeri and Irene mediocre raps since they have GREAT vocals already. Their Red raps are cute at best and cringy at worst. On the other hand, their Velvet raps are where it\u2019s at tbh. Usually these raps ate always good and not out of place, whereas their Red raps sometimes feel just thrown in. But again, I\u2019ve noticed in their ReVe Festival Day 2 album that both of their voices work great in the choruses. The girls harmonize very well, and I think Irene and Yeri\u2019s pulls it all together. Even when they aren\u2019t just singing the chorus, they slay their individual lines and should be given more to work with.Seulgi is a great dancer and vocalist, and she has unbeatable stage presence. She\u2019s their goddamn ace for sure, but I really don\u2019t find myself impressed with her dancing a lot of the time. What I mean is, her group dancing is always great, but when given other choreo or when doing freestyle, I just don\u2019t find myself impressed with it. Maybe it\u2019s the choreography or something, but I find myself preferring other idol dancers.I have a few thoughts on Wendy.Her actions when she imitated black and white people were not racist, but they were ignorant and she was definitely stereotyping. She deserves criticism, and it\u2019s fine if you decide to not supoort her, but you will gain absolutely nothing by attacking her with racist and other harmful remarks.I honestly have no idea what she did to her face, like I keep looking at her debut stages/pictures and her current stages/pictures but I cannot for the life of me figure out how she\u2019s changed. I suspected a nose job, but in Bad Boy teasers her nose looks almost the same as her debut nose. I know this isn\u2019t even an opinion, but jesus it\u2019s honestly irritating me so much that I can\u2019t pinpoint what she changed. People say jaw surgery, but her jaw looks the same! Search her \u201cBe Natural\u201d fancam and compare with her current fancams; they\u2019re the goddamn same. Maybe fillers? Or botox? I thought it was her hair, then her weight, but in the \u201cButterfly\u201d stages from one of the Gayo Daejuns, she has no bangs and is about the same weight yet STILL looks different. Like is it really just age and stress from the idol life (crazy diets, no sleep, general stress and fatigue, etc)?? The other girls almost look entirely the same (except maybe Joy but I just accepted it has something to do with her teeth/lips). This is stupid and long, but I hate not knowing lol.RV\u2019s biggest enemy is SM. They could be bigger in the West if SM promoted them as much as they do NCT 127 (a casual fan of 127, but I got recommended SO many of their America interviews). RV\u2019s Velvet sound is their STRONGEST point, and SM should showcase those sidetracks more! \u201cSo Good\u201d, \u201cKingdom Come\u201d, \u201cLight Me Up\u201d, \u201cSunny Side Up\u201d, \u201cEyes Locked, Hands Locked\u201d. Their rnb sound is PURE BLISS. But barely anyone outside of the reveluv fandom knows this. They should be singing these on radio shows and just performing them more!! Put it on their goddamn setlist for their concerts god dammit. There\u2019s 2 main things I\u2019d complain about to SM and it\u2019d be their promotion for NCT, and then their promotion for RV. STEP UP YOUR GAME SM!! We want VELVET TRACKS!",

            "answer_text": "Warning: may be offensive Joy deserves to be visual Irene just has a plain face, sure it fits korea's standards but she doesn't show any expressions and it can be a bit average if she doesn't put effort. Joy on the other hand looks ethereal without even trying.  Seulgi, Joy and Wendy have the best stage presence. No, let me correct myself, Seulgi, Joy and Wendy only have the stage presence. Yeri occasionally zones out and Irene has the same blank expression during performances. Wendy literally GLOWS during stages like Power Up and Red Flavour. Joy and Seulgi OWNED Bad Boy and Peek a Boo. The rumor of Irene bullying other trainees to leave is much more beleivable that Joy scaring trainees. The rumors are first of all absolutely groundless, ridiculous and stupid. Netizens, if you are gonna make rumors at LEAST try and make them realistic. Irene would be most likely to scare trainees away because she has a very quiet, scary demeanor. Joy on the other hand doesn't. Irene just keeping silent would be enough to get anyone on edge. NOT Joy. Yeri\u2019s relationship with NCT Dream is adorable. She's the maknae of RV but still a noona to the dreamies. She has the best relationdhip with them and treats them like younger brothers. Most people hate their closeness because of the ships. But Yeri doesnt make the atmosphere \u2018flirty\u2019 or anything but plain friendly. Which is why, along with Heechul and Taehyung, she is the most sociable idols. (The reason this^ is an unpopular opinion is because most ppl hate her and nct but i adore them)  Irene hating men isnt \u2018funny' Sure, the posts of her avoiding men on youtube and twitter are something to laugh at but the faces she makes when man just PASS BY her are stupid. They didn't even LOOK at her but she seems angry. People say it's funny but i dont think it is (thus it's an unpopular opinion).  But in cases like these she is totally right:  Joy's acting isn't that bad It's actually pretty good for a rookie actor and still active idol. She did better than most idols when they debuted in the acting industry. And her kiss scene\u2026\u2026not too awkward and not too much. Not perfect but better than how other idols would do it. Plus the role she was playing was hard to portray.  Them being hated on for eating bingsu or ice cream (i dunno which) after their win for power up was IDIOTIC. Twice ate ice. Red Velvet ate too\u2026..just a food with better taste and more calories. Nobody hated on Twice so why hate on RV?  Wendy's weight loss was tragic For others, it would be goals to lose that mich weight in such little time. But in reality, her weight ballooned majorly when she was onstage, offstage, on promotions and on rest. Her constant weight gain and weight loss in little time shows the struggles she had with food. When she gains it was a result of falling in love with food or binge eating. When she loses weight it was her restricting herself too much or simply depriving herself of food and joy after gaining. To us it's goals but to her it's a mental battle. Whether she loves food or hates it. And i really hopes she finds the in between.  Joy's weight loss was the best Along with Jihyo's , Joy has the steadiest and prettiest weight loss. Tbh she looked great before as well. It's unpopular because ppl prefer quick weight losses but i don't? I prefer healthy, happy idols not broken, deprived ones.   Joy and Seulgi fit every Red Velvet concept. Be it Red or Velvet, Seulgi and Joy can pull it off.     ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a ReVeluv, but I do listen to Red Velvet\u2019s music quite often. Please don\u2019t hate on me if you don\u2019t agree with me. SM likes Seulgi the mostI say this because in many music videos, Seulgi gets the most screen time. She often stands out with her outfits, etc. She is also positioned in the middle a lot. It also looks like a lot more effort was put into her makeup and looks. It also seems like sometimes she overshadows the other members, for example in Umpah Umpah the other girls didn\u2019t have very bright colours for their dresses but Seulgi really stood out in bold pink. 2. Their newer music videos are better I think songs like Umpah Umpah and Zimzalabim are better than the older songs, in terms of aesthetic and looks. Some of the other songs had a very basic concept for aesthetic and the same dance moves over and over again. 3. Irene should not be main rapper Irene is talented in general, but she does not fit the \u2018rapper\u2019 vibe. She would do way better as a vocalist. 4. They should not do rap All 5 girls are talented, but sometimes it seems they lack in the rap talent. I can see them all as successful vocalists. Their rap just isn\u2019t as strong as the vocal line. 5. Sappy and Russian Roulette were their best songs They aren\u2019t the most popular songs, but in my opinion they are very underrated. But the girls all sound amazing in these songs and the music is spot on. 6. They seem a bit insecure and shy Sometimes in interviews, they look a bit anxious and nervous talking to the interviewers. When they are asked about dating, they look really uncomfortable. Also, sometimes they seem a bit hesitant to have \u2018fun\u2019 by being silly or something. But I understand that they might not be allowed because it might make their group look a bit weird / immature. 7. Yeri gets too much hate She is the maknae and was the last to be introduced in the group. She has been bullied a lot and sometimes even by ReVeluvs. For example she was bullied for her weight and chubbiness. People said she was fat and ugly which is not true. I think people forget that she is still young. In comparison to the Ice Cream Cake music video, she looks a lot thinner than Umpah Umpah and Zimzalabim, since she was bullied into losing more weight. 8. Wendy doesn\u2019t need to lose weight We have already seen what happened to her. Sometimes she would become very skinny and other times she would gain tons of weight. This is very common in people who do extreme dieting because they will go cold turkey and starve themselves, and then give in and binge on huge amounts of food. This isn\u2019t healthy and can be dangerous. 9. Irene doesn\u2019t hate men People joke about Irene hating men which is not true! Irene might look annoyed or uncomfortable around them but that doesn\u2019t mean she hates them. Her normal resting face can look a bit like she is annoyed but this does not mean she hates them. She is obviously a strong fighter for women\u2019s rights, and the only times I see her angry or annoyed at men is when they say rude things. For example one man once said that he plays video games while his wife does the chores and cooks food in the house with complete casualty. 10. They are underrated These days, everyone only talks about groups like TWICE, Mamamoo, Momoland, BLACKPINK, etc. The girls themselves in Red Velvet are popular but the group as a whole isn\u2019t. 11. They are criticised too much People made fun of them for Zimzalabim, claiming it was weird. In reality Red Velvet experiments a lot with different concepts which is fun and interesting. For example Umpah Umpah had a summer vacation vibe to it, and Peekaboo had a dark, mysterious cheeky vibe. Red Velvet doesn\u2019t really focus on being cute, they focus on being unique. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a fan of them, but I do know somethings about them. I know these are kind of wrong, but please read my explanation before you attack and bash me. I don\u2019t get the hype with seulgiI know that she\u2019s talented, but a lot of people say she\u2019s the best in the industry which I don\u2019t get. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s to special about her. Her dance style isn\u2019t really for me nor is her voiceRed Velvet fans aren\u2019t as respectful and non problematic as y\u2019all claim to be.I got attack by toxic fans just because I said they aren\u2019t my style. They continue to harrass me in my comments and messages. I actually find it funny now, but red velvet stans love to brag about how chill their fandom is and how \u201cunproblematic\u201d they are. I beg to differ. Every fandom has problematic stans so.Irene is kind of plainI get that she fits Korean beauty standards a lot, but her face I pretty plain to me. From an outsiders perspective, she appears to not bring much to the plate and appears kind of cold and uninteresting. She just seems like she doesn\u2019t have much about her, like she\u2019s not a deep person. But I must make it clear that I DO NOT stan them, so I wouldn\u2019t know.Wendy is not the best vocalist in K-popShe\u2019s amazing, but the best in the K-pop industry\u2026 I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s a very hard title to earn and I don\u2019t think any idol has achieved that title either.Red Velvets\u2019 concept is the only thing holding them backDon\u2019t get me wrong, they have a unique and very brilliant concept, but I think it\u2019s one of the reasons they aren\u2019t as popular as Blackpink and Twice. There concept is part cute and bubble gum and r&b girl crush. I know a lot of people like their concept, but I come to find that more people like their velvet side, but they don\u2019t have many velvet songs. They mostly stick with their red side and I think that is what\u2019s holding them back. Not to mention their songs/mvs are kind of \u201cweird.\u201d I don\u2019t want to say weird, but I don\u2019t know how else to put it. Maybe very different, and I don\u2019t think many people can appreciate that. The reason why BP is so big internationally is because of their girl crush concept, aka their black side (that doesn\u2019t sound to good lol). Cutesy bubble gum stuff doesn\u2019t do as well internationally as it does domestically. Us westerners eat up girl crush (not all of us of course). That\u2019s why Twice and Red Velvet have a harder time in the western market/internationally.Red Velvet songs are hard to get into.They are either a hit or miss and for me they mostly are a miss. I don\u2019t see anything good about their songs. Well, not that their songs are bad, just that I personally am not into a lot of them. I understand it all comes down to personal preference though, that is why so many people like them, I\u2019m just not one of those people. Nothing against the girls though.Irenes whole things about her hating men is problematic and should not be a thing.I guess fans joke about it, but to outsiders it doesn\u2019t really see, much of a joke, I mean when I saw her give those evil looks to men I really didn\u2019t laugh or think it was such a funny joke, I thought it was kind of problematic. I mean lot of people can misinterpreted the \u201cjoke\u201d and actually think she hates men. The videos and the tweets about it isn\u2019t funny nor something we should praise. Let me clarify that I\u2019m not saying Irene is a bad or anything, I just think fans shouldn\u2019t be joking about that.Joy (and Yeri) is the only member that stands outWhen I first discovered Red Velvet, everything about Joy stood out. Her quirky personality, her visuals, her stage presence, her voice, and her dancing. She might not be the best dancer or vocalist, but I think she is amazing. I honestly adore her. Yeri would be the second member that stood out to me. Her visuals caught my attention first. She seems like a sweet and cute girl. I did hear that she is an evil maknae though lol.I don\u2019t think Red Velvet is actually the Nationals GG.They are then great, but whenever I rarely heard anyone talk about it and when I look up Korea\u2019s nations Girl group Twice and SNSD come up. They don\u2019t really have the same response as Twice and SNSD have as well. Also, Twice and Blackpink are usually higher up then them when it comes to popularity and success, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to have Red Velvet hold the title of Nations GG.Seulgi with bangs is a not all thatI don\u2019t know how popular this opinion is amongst fans, but I see quite a lot of fans praise her bangs. Sure a times she looks great like here:   but other times\u2026         That\u2019s just me though, think she looks better without them.   Ok bye and sorry for spelling mistakes, typing on my phone is kind of difficult. Lol  ",

            "answer_text": "I love Red Velvet! Here are my unpopular opinions about them, not to cause any offense to anyone, but as requested I will answer: Yeri doesn\u2019t deserve the hate she is getting. Especially with her stage presence, honestly from the moment there were speculations that she was performing poorly on stage, I would say she has definitely improved throughout their comebacks. And she has noticed that lots of people have been saying that about her, and she is trying to make an effort the best she can possibly do. So please stop with the hate comments on Yeri, you can dislike her but throwing all this hate on her, won\u2019t help her at all.Seulgi and Joy are probably the faces of the group. Really whenever I think of red velvet, those names and faces pop up in my head the most. I know Irene is probably the face of the group, and the center as what her profiles are saying, but she doesn\u2019t really stand out as much compared to these two. Everyone is beautiful in Red Velvet, there is no true visual in Red Velvet but these two probably stand out in terms of stage presence.\u2018Really Bad Boy\u2019. Was probably the most disappointing comeback for Red Velvet, they didn\u2019t even win any music show awards despite who was competing with them. The song was good, vocals and visuals were on point as always, but the lyrics were very repetitive and quite corny (In my opinion). Not to mention, it always seems to be compared with their better song \u2018Bad Boy\u2019, which was well sought out.I honestly can\u2019t get into \u2018Rookie\u2019. I love most of Red Velvet\u2019s songs, but Rookie is one that I just cannot get into no matter how many times I listen to it.\u2018Kingdom Come\u2019 needed a live. Oh my god, if Red Velvet ever needed to perform one of their side tracks, this song better be in a performance. This song is an absolute bop, and needed that stage performance it deserves.Red Velvet does an amazing job with their concept. I don\u2019t know if this is even a unpopular opinion. But they have explained before that \u201cRed\u201d is in terms of happiness and songs that are upbeat and joyful. While \u201cVelvet\u201d is more mature and serious, probably a ballad or something like \u2018Peek-a-boo\u201d, \u2018Bad Boy\u2019. or \u2018Automatic\u2019. They do a really good job of evenly dividing that concept. In almost most of their comebacks you get one or the other.Red Velvet won\u2019t be the nation\u2019s girl group of their generation. They are really popular, and have a large fanbase. But compared to when SNSD was really active, they do not have the same response. Twice holds that same response as SNSD, which I would consider Twice the nation\u2019s girl group.Wendy is not one of SM\u2019s greatest vocalists. Despite her song with John Legend, and a few individual activities. She still has a long way to go, her vocals are quite average, but I don\u2019t think what she has shown us as of now is her true potential and her best voice.That is probably all of the unpopular opinions I have about Red Velvet, unless I think of anything else to add, I will comeback and edit it. Again, not here to offend any fan, but just to state my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve discovered this magnificent group back in January, but I\u2019ll still try to put out my thoughts, too: Irene\u2019s role in the group is still unclear.I\u2019m not saying she has no talent or anything like that, but clearly their label is playing dirty games when it comes to her. She\u2019s known as the \u201cvisual\u201d of the group, but\u2026Quite frankly, I find this title rather embarrassing and tacky. And the saddest part is that a big part of the fandom finds it sensible. THIS AIN\u2019T IT!Yeri is criminally underrated.Do I need to say more? Yes, she is underrated from the begging and it\u2019s pretty noticible. That\u2019s so unfortune because this girl shows so much potential! Her voice is very unique, fits every theme, she\u2019s a very cheerful and energetic performer with charisma. She should be put as a lead on at least a B-Cut song! She\u2019s basically on a race with Irene when it comes to getting least lines. So unfair and their label doesn\u2019t give a\u2026about it.Rookie is a very good song.I honestly was shook when I first found out that it was less approved by the fandom and even sometimes listed as \u201cworst RR song\u201d! Girl\u2026I\u2019m still gonna continue to listen to it EVERY DAY and keep it on REPLAY. PerdiodT.Their rap game isn\u2019t terrible, nor is it perfect! Well it\u2019s not considered bad, because they\u2019re simply aren\u2019t known for that. And I\u2019m only saying this because they don\u2019t do that anymore or do it very rearly. But they showed so much potential with it! For example, I only listen to Red Flavor because those rap verses delivered from Irene and Yeri are honestly brilliant. It makes the song so much better and enjoyable!Wendy = Seulgi, when it comes to vocal strenght.Yes, you have read it here first! These ones are known to be titled as \u201cbest singers of the group\u201d. And not for nothing! No denying that Wendy is a power-house vocalist and it really shows. But when talking about the tone\u2026Seulgi takes the cake, even though it\u2019s close. Her voice is also very alluring and somewhat strong as well. It\u2019s a close battle but I think they\u2019re equally strong in this field.Hear the Sea is Top 10 in their discography.Oh heck yeah! I love this song, even though Irene and Yeri are both kinda robbed in it\u2026 But this track is honestly magic. 10/10.I could listen to it all day long and it puts me in such a calming and neat mood. Also I think it\u2019s their best ballad.Peek-A-Boo era had the best looks.I know many can agree but their looks that era were FIRE. Not too over-the-top, not too basic. They were perfect. Joy, Yeri and Irene were the highlights of course.Their Japanese tracks are top-notch, underappreciated. Not that it\u2019s that upopular of a fact, but clearly it isn\u2019t emphasized enough!My favorites:Sayonara - very fair line distribution (Hear the Sea can\u2019t relate), heavinly melody and VOCALS.#Cookie Jar - a fun, positively quirky, happy song. Easily tops some of their overhyped Korean stuff. Sappy - trully a highlight on its own. Very cohesive and fun. Deserved to top the Japanese charts. \u2026There should be no \u201cleaders\u201d in this group.Irene\u2019s role as \u201cleader of the group\u201d isn\u2019t that deserved, nor needed. Wendy could be considered as one but she doesn\u2019t have to. There\u2019s simply no reason why there needs to be one, especially in this group.Actually, most of the girls groups out there don\u2019t even have that position.They all deserve at least a 3-month break from everything. I feel like they\u2019re overdoing it a bit, to the point that it can become unhealthy. A longer break from EVERYTHING would do wonders to them. These girls work their asses off, but I think a little cooldown is essential.There are no \u201cworst singers\u201d in the group.Yep, all girls have their strenghts when it comes to singing. Wendy, Seulgi and Joy are known for their brilliant heights and prominence. Irene and Yeri are known for their charming, heavenly, soft and melodic tones. There are no bad singers in this group.Sunny Side Up! > Zimzalabim.I\u2019m not a Zimbzalabim hater, I also don\u2019t think it shouldn\u2019t have been the lead single. I simply think that Sunny Side Up! is the best track on their latest record and it honestly has such a cool, rare vibe. I can\u2019t never get enough of this song!They are equally beautiful, in and out.They all are talented. They all make Red Velvet. They all are shining on their own.Irene is not useless, she just often feels out of place.Her role in the group is poorly handled but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s worthless. She\u2019s the most mature of them. It feels like she\u2019s in line with everyone and takes care of everyone. She just cannot be not needed. Without her there would be no Red Velvet, just like without any other member.They don\u2019t have bad songs, but I feel like low-key Dumb Dumb is not that good.I could say it\u2019s their worst song but I\u2019d wrong, because I listen to it. If it was bad I wouldn\u2019t bother listening. It\u2019s just too repetitive I guess.",

            "answer_text": "ASK AND YE SHALL RECEIVE. You want unpopular? Hold on to your fragile and biased egos. JOY AND SEULGI ARE RIDICULOUSLY OVERRATED. Literally go to any RV group video. It\u2019s 99% Joy this, Seulgi that. Do they deserve recognition? Absolutely, they worked hard. Do they also have the most irritating, obsessive fans that tweet up a storm and flood the comments sections? Fuckin\u2019 A. Shut the fuck up and let other fans talk about their biases too. JOY ISN\u2019T EVEN THAT PRETTY To be sure she\u2019s prettier than me, no illusions about that. But someone here really said her beauty was \u201cethereal\u201d lmao maybe look up what that word means before using it in a sentence? Joy fans are also the most PRESSED when it comes to the group\u2019s visuals. Look up that YouTube video where a guy asks STRANGERS and non-Kpop fans in New York who they thought was the prettiest. Only one of them chose Joy, and Joy stans lost their damn shit like they really didn\u2019t think their bias is just not as objectively good looking as the rest. SEULGI SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE EVERYTHING JFC WTF Sure she can sing and dance. But she\u2019s literally not the only one??? So why is she being made to sprinkle unnecessary adlibs during other member\u2019s parts?? Irene and Yeri already get nonexistent lines as it is, and you\u2019re still making Seulgi waltz in and steal what little vocal spotlight those two get. Just stop. Not to mention, they\u2019re giving Seulgi lines the subvocalists could easily handle/sing. Like damn does she not get enough lines already?? They literally have too many songs where she has 30secs more on Irene/Yeri. Stop shoving her down our throats already. Also really the only reason she was able to \u201cshine\u201d as a dancer is because of SM\u2019s stupid obsession with images and how their artists need to look and act a certain way. Irene is an insanely good dancer\u2014their choreographer even said she\u2019s the best of the group because she has a natural rhythm that you just can\u2019t \u201clearn\u201d (i.e., it\u2019s something you have to be born with, and no amount of training will give you that). But SM forced her into that cold elegant image and god forbid she moves as she actually can. Seulgi\u2019s a good dancer, to be sure. But there\u2019s something robotic about her movements. Like she\u2019s obviously trained and she practiced them hard. But it doesn\u2019t come naturally to her. ",

Oh well. Onto the question! Unpopular Opinion 1 Why is their music so babylike? Nothing against them, I mean, I love their songs and all, but these are grown women singing about Ice Cream Cake, and how \u201cIt\u2019s so tasty! Come and chase me!\u201d Yeah, and then the companies wonder why their idols get things like death threats and sasaeng fans stalking their every single move. It just seems like by now, they would have more mature sounding music. It\u2019s cute and I get that fans would love that, but for me, it\u2019s just kinda.. off.. Unpopular Opinion 2 For me, this kinda extends for almost all K-Pop girl (and boy) groups, but they are so skinny. Once again, I understand that image is massive in South Korea, but to require your trainees to be painfully thin and even get plastic surgery?? Eesh\u2026 I just wonder how badly that might toll on their health. Now that I think about it, this opinion might be very popular, actually. Unpopular Opinion 3 Last one for now, but as many ReVeluvs would know, they came out with \u201cThe Perfect Velvet\u201d in November of 2017, and then came out with the repackage, aptly named \u201cThe Perfect Red Velvet\u201d on January 29 2018. Okay, just an album, right? Yes. But, you might notice that they are similarly titled and has a new song. Once again, normal for a repackage, right? Yeah. But that title. It\u2019s like the company was saying that they weren\u2019t perfect before, and now they are. Or even just the fact that the girls are perfect in general! I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, Irene, Seulgi, Yeri, Joy and Wendy are all amazing and I can\u2019t wait to get more into this group, but still. That title.. \u201cThe Perfect Red Velvet..\u201d Eesh, say that in a creepy voice. No thanks. That\u2019s all for now! I might come back and add more depending on whether I get more into the group or not, but anyways, that\u2019s all for now! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I don\u2019t stan Red Velvet but I know enough about them to be able to recognize their faces/names and to know basic characteristics about them. Feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong about some things though. Joy is the one that stood out to me as the prettiest.I always thought that Joy was the prettiest but that's just my opinion. I get that Irene fits Korean beauty standards the best and I\u2019m not denying that she\u2019s pretty at all but I guess she fits the standards so well that she didn\u2019t really stand out to me though. If that makes sense. Wendy is one of the best vocalists in the industry.As much as I don\u2019t like her, I won\u2019t deny her talent. Wendy\u2019s Scandal,,, (Skip to 1:54) As you can see, the question asked wasn\u2019t meant to be offensive at all. Hodong asked if there were different dialects in English like there are in Korean. Wendy could have stated that she didn\u2019t want to answer the question, which would\u2019ve probably resulted in the segment being cut out. She also could have said no, there aren\u2019t different dialects which isn't true, and while lying isn\u2019t ideal, it is another way of getting out of answering the question. Instead, Wendy did a \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d accent/dialect. I won\u2019t go too into the white one as she just did a valley girl accent and acted like how most teenage girls did. The \u201cblack\u201d accent was offensive though as it inforced the stereotype that black women are aggressive. She did this on national TV which means that many Koreans who have not encountered black people since the Korean population is mostly Korean will belive this harmful stereotype. You can already see the effect of her imitation on the other people on the show. What makes me madder is how one, she lived in Canada, there are videos of her with black classmates, and how she never apologized. She also did it twice.  (Video of her with a black classmate)  (This is from 2014 if anyone wants me to translate I can lmao) honestly, at this point, I just think she\u2019s hella dumb. Red Velvet\u2019s rappers,, it\u2019s okay to be a vocal group you know.Irene should control her RBF a bit sometimes.If it\u2019s off stage or if it\u2019s a really long concert/performance, I don\u2019t have a problem with it, but if it\u2019s when she\u2019s performing a two or three-minute song, I think it should be controlled as usually she looks bored/mad on stage. She did improve a lot during Monster/Naughty stages, so maybe it has to do with the concept, but then again, I don\u2019t think concepts are a good excuse. Now, this is just my experience so it may not be the same for Irene. Anyways, I get called out for having an RBF all the time, I\u2019ve even had strangers come up to me and ask me what\u2019s wrong during normal off-stage events. Notice how I said off-stage? When I\u2019m on stage, and aware that there will be a lot of people looking at me, I consciously try to control my facial expressions. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something that certain people can\u2019t do so maybe Irene can\u2019t control her facial expressions? I don\u2019t know, I guess I just wouldn\u2019t want to go to a concert or performance and have a member of my favorite group looking bored out of her mind, you know what I mean? I really like Yeri\u2019s voice.Like her unique vocal tone:) Irene\u2019s insanely pretty.\ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc4d ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really like the unpopular opinions hype nor what people use this for, but I will be as respectful as possible. Although their rap line isn\u2019t the best, Yeri is a better rapper than Irene. I\u2019m not saying that they\u2019re pros, but I feel like Yeri has more skill in rap when it comes to her flow and her emphasis on words.Their latest comebacks were finally Red Velvet. Let me explain: Their debut title track, Happiness, was all Red. Be Natural was all Velvet. And then the pattern sort of continued: Just Red, just Velvet, but Peek-A-Boo was where it all changed for me. The concept itself was very RED VELVET, the dance was Velvet and the production, I find, was a mature Red, if you will.Wendy is probably the best female vocalist of this generation (not including Solji of EXID). You can try to fight me but it\u2019s true. Her vocal range is astounding, she can always put the right emotion in her voice, and she NEVER fails her high notes as well as her lower ones. She\u2019s also very stable in live stages, so there\u2019s that.Peek-A-Boo is their best comeback, and you ALL know it. Alright, this is self-explanatory. Peek-A-Boo sounds Red, but the outfits, the dance and the aesthetic were Velvet. Add the music and the MV symbolism, and you\u2019ve got Red. It was indeed the Perfect Red Velvet.Joy is the second best dancer, in my opinion. I don\u2019t know what it is, but every time she dances, I can feel the joy or the sexiness oozing from her! I love her style, although Seulgi is indeed better.Red Flavor is my favourite comeback. Ok, everything about this comeback was ON POINT!!! The vocals, the dance, even the rap(?)!!! Although this was more Red, they rock the summer concept SUPER WELL!!That\u2019s all I have for now! <3 ",

            "answer_text": "gonna hurt some feeling, i think. (im sorry if anyone is offended). this is an opinion from a casual listener, not a huge fan. Seulgi is the only attractive stage performer in Red Velvet.Others barely had any stage presence, while Seulgi is fiercer in terms of stage presensce. Joy has the weakest facial expression, Wendy is fine (i love her smile, and her facial expression sometimes), and other three are average. Irene barely had any expression, tho. 2. Yeri is so underrated. I know people called her the \u2018least talented\u2019 or \u2018just a visual\u2019 but her vocals are on of the best in Red Velvet. I would never know she has the \u2018least talented\u2019 label on her, if not because of people telling me. (that\u2019s how good i think her vocal is) 3. Irene is doing the bare minimum in the group. She is the first member that I recognized from Red Velvet, and she truly shines as the face of the group. But as a vocalist, dancer, or rapper? I mean, she can always be better, but for now, she is doing the bare minimum to me :/ 4. Wendy has great vocals, at first\u2026 But then, it just got bad? Idk what\u2019s wrong. her high notes aren\u2019t powerful or stable like when I first discovered them? Idk anything about vocal technique but as people who casually listen to their music, and watch their stage, it is kinda worrying. I am just worried that her vocal chords are gonna messed up one day. She is the most powerful vocalist out of 3rd gen SM idols, so she should take care of her vocal chords. 5. Look, I love Joy but her acting\u2026 just not IT. I truly didn\u2019t enjoy her acting in the \u2018the great seducer\u2019. idk :/ sometimes i wish the other girl (idk the name but that girl that is the best friend with the hero) is the heroine. Like, cmon\u2026 the plot is fine AF but then\u2026.. and her vocals are kinda annoying sometimes 6. I love their cute/funky songs more than their Velvet side I love rookie (i know yall hate it. i like it), power up, red flavour (my ult fav), russian roulette, happiness, dumb dumb, and the only velvet song i like from them is bad boy. peekaboo and really bad boy? not really. 7. this is just an instinct, i hope it\u2019s not true but I know they are having comeback soon, and I feel like the comeback won\u2019t be as successful :/ idk why. i just feel like there is no one around me talking about red velvet. They were mostly talking about 4th gen ggs. i feel like the hype around them died already, but i hope that\u2019s not true. 8. really bad boy is their worst song, and their best is red flavour. tho Power up got a pak, power up is the kind of song that got me annoyed so fast (prolly bcs of the too many bananana lol), but red flavour just never gets old. that\u2019s all. i wish them all the best for their comeback!

            "answer_text": "K-pop stans need to realize that Red Velvet will not always be who they want to be. Yes, it is normal for people to set expectations in a group\u2019s comeback but in Red Velvet\u2019s case, especially after a Velvet comeback (which some people like more enough for it to go crazy popular), people who don\u2019t really know them or people who became a fan only because they want more songs like Bad Boy only mainly listen to songs with heavy bass drops or girl-crush/cutesy songs because they\u2019re easy to bop to.Red Velvet are not just \u201cSummer Queens\u201d. With the huge, influential success of Red Flavor and Power Up in Korea, I think that RV keeps on coming back during summer season just because they are perceived as the \u201cSummer Queens\u201d and they are the most demanded group in Korea during the season, which does a lot to their digital and album sales. However, I also believe that Red Velvet, however unpopular they may be compared to today\u2019s mainstream K-pop groups, will eventually stop their summer comeback thing after some time. I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t want to only be remembered for their summer songs because that is not the reason why their group was formed in the first place. It\u2019s not their brand at all. So, I don\u2019t blame them if they choose not to return with another summer comeback in the coming years.Out of the 3rd Gen girl groups, Red Velvet (and Mamamoo) will be the last to disband or in the very least, have a member leave the group. Now hol\u2019 up, hear me out, I know that the majority thinks that Irene will leave the group the soonest because she is in the finishing line of her 20\u2019s so she might want to start pursuing solo careers or even quit being an idol stuff like that, BUT I think that because of 2nd gen groups staying together even inactive ones (look at Girls\u2019 Generation!), the next generations will surely follow in their steps and make sure their group lasts until they get tired of it. Now, as to why I think Red Velvet will last the longest among the Big 3 ggs: their experimental music is the #1 factor why the public will still love them after so long. PLUS, they are not mainly performance-based rather they rely more on their singing and instrumental voices which is another huge factor because idols can\u2019t keep on dancing those hard, quick, symmetrical, trendy choreography when they get older. Their diverse title tracks and B-sides are not limited and targeted to a certain age group, so even if RV are in their 30\u2019s, I guarantee you they would still perform songs like Happiness or Zimzalabim even.",

            "answer_text": "As a disclamer , i'd like to say that RED VELVET is my favorite group, i love them with all my heart . So, this won't be a hate answer. Joy should get more lines ( especially in songs with only the vocal line). Her voice is very underrated and I feel like most people like her because of her visuals and her personality rather than her vocals. Joy\u2019s voice was the first one I could differentiate after I became an official fan in the Rookie era. Her voice is like honey and suits lots of red songs perfectly. I feel like it would add more variance to the songs if she had more lines and it The Ice Cream Cake Mini Album is so underrated. Ice Cream Cake got Red Velvet their first win and so many people just decided to skip over the rest of Mini album. It\u2019s one of RV\u2019s best albums and I honestly don\u2019t get how so many people sleep on it. Something Kinda Crazy and Stupid Cupid are in my top 10 favorite tracks from them. Hit My Drum is my least favorite Red Velvet song. I know that a lot people love this track, but I don\u2019t personally enjoy it. While I absolutely love most of it (especially Wendy\u2019s long held note and the 3, 2, 1 Hit it!) I despise the high dirty synth sound in the second part of the chorus. On first listen, it was unbearable, but it has grown to be a passable nuisance. I don't like the girls in blonde hair. I only like Irene & Yeri in blonde, the other members aren\u2019t ugly I just think it doesn\u2019t fit them well. In Automatic, and ice cream cake eras I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the hair.  Irene is pretty no matter what. Not to be um favoriting and all but Irene will always be beautiful and no matter what hair color or what she wears she\u2019ll always be a goddess so... Thanks!! \u2014Deevin Hoang \u2014 ",

            "answer_text": "This might not be an entirely satisfying answer for you (I apologize for that in advance). But I tried. Peek a Boo > Bad boy - even though Bad Boy is a cool song with a sexy, alluring aura and is quite popular, I prefer Peek a Boo\u2019s mysterious and kinda creepy concept. I prefer the instrumental and the melody more.I\u2019m lowkey scared of Irene and Yeri - I mean, I know they\u2019re very nice and a fun girls to be around once you get to know them but I guess their overall auras and concepts made a uge impact on my decision and influenced my attitude. Like, I\u2019d be scared and embarrased to approach both of them or ask them for help at first.I still can\u2019t fully understand Red Velvet\u2019s stage presence - sometimes you can feel the power coming from them, sometimes not. Don\u2019t get me wrong - they are my ultimate favourites out of BIG3 GGs but I sometimes can\u2019t feel the energy and the vibe coming from them. I don\u2019w want to compare but there\u2019s another group that always leaves me overwhelmed with their stage presence. I don\u2019t know where to find the explanation to this ,,problem\u201d - I wish that they emitted all the energy they could, they are really capable of doing that. They already captivate the audience, I know but I have this feeling most of the times that they aren\u2019y fully opening up. I don\u2019t want to blame them for this completely but I don\u2019t know where to find the answer to this.Talking about stage presence, RBB, Russian Roulette and Red Flavor were the eras that demonstrated the girls\u2019 stage presence wonderfully, especially Joy and Wendy were the ones who were in charge of this (my opinion, of course). Also the ,,Happiness\u201d was very bright and catchy.RBB > Bad boy in terms of musicality and badass level (this opinion might change later but for for now, it\u2019s been like this for a while).This was it. I hope I was respectful in my opinions. Let me know what your opinions are and what you thought about mine. :) ",

I REALLY like Seulgi's face (especially her sharp monolid eyes) and I can feel a strong charisma and confidence in her when she's performing, but I guess she\u2019s rather shy offstage?I don't think Red Velvet has ever had a bad song untill Really Bad Boy, sorry. RBB is not that bad actually but I guess my expectation is high since it\u2019s Red Velvet.Red Velvet is the aesthetic queen.Everything about Red Velvet is aesthetic, have I mentioned that?Irene is a good person and a good Unnie but I kinda get where the criticism comes from, but I guess sometimes people can be unnecessarily harsh.I just realized Joy is TALL af, like wtf? (It's good).I really like the rap in Ice Cream Cake.Red Velvet doing a lot of collaborations, OSTs, and other projects is good.There's something about Red Velvet that makes them unique and stands out from other girl groups.People should get over the \u201cracist\u201d Wendy controversy. She's wrong, I won't defend her but I guess she didn't have any bad intention about that. Shes just being ignorant that time and didn't think her actions through (ik this is not that unpopular but, eh).So that's it I guess? I don\u2019t really have much. Thank you for the request. Bye~ ",

            "answer_text": "One good thing about them is that they can carry nearly all kinds of concepts - the energetic Happiness, the creepy Russian Roulette, serial killers in Peek-a-Boo, etc. Not many girl groups can do/are doing this, even SNSD - well, yeah, they have a few girl crush songs but it feels kind of weird. But RV, on the other hand, really handles them fairly well. Their vocals are pretty stable - better than Blackpink, I would say. But their voices\u2026Not really sure about that. I love Irene\u2019s, Seulgi\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s voices, they are beautiful, and I am also okay with Yeri\u2019s, but Joy\u2019s is a little odd compared with the other 4, and sometimes her voice is not clear enough (idk if it\u2019s nasal or not). Their dances are definitely overhyped though. To be honest, Seulgi is the only one who has better dancing, but her freestyle is really weird. Besides, many people are saying that they have knife choreography, but I don\u2019t think so. They are not really in sync, and some of their dances are too easy and weak (weak as in the moves, not their skills) to be classified as knife choreography. Lastly, I really find Joy\u2019s and Yeri\u2019s personalities annoying. Joy is obviously thinking too high of herself sometimes, and Yeri really went too far when she said RV is the Nation\u2019s Girl Group - like, no. SNSD is still here (although they are somehow breaking apart), and RV isn\u2019t particularly more liked than Twice and Blackpink, who are also hot girl groups atm. ",

And Irene\u2019s so called \u201cbland personality\u201d really fits it in my opinion. \u2022They\u2019re not good rappers\u2022 I don\u2019t think this is too unpopular but it\u2019s definitely true. However, that\u2019s not a bad thing. SM specializes in vocals and Red Velvet\u2019s concept fits vocals better than rap to me. \u2022They have good stage presence\u2022 I will say that I their earlier days their stage presence wasn\u2019t the best but they\u2019ve definitely improved. Joy seems to have improved the most and I\u2019d even say her presence is equal to or even better than Seulgi\u2019s as of now. \u2022Wendy isn\u2019t the best vocalist of this generation\u2022 In the big 3, then I\u2019d say she is. But you can\u2019t discard all the other amazing vocalists outside of the big 3. There\u2019s artists like IU, all of Mamamoo, Taeyeon, Ailee, and Luna that, at least in my opinion, are better than Wendy. She\u2019s in no way a bad vocalist, though.  \u2022Irene is important to the group\u2022 To me she\u2019s an amazing leader. She\u2019s definitely very mature which is what I believe makes her the good leader she is. But In the talent area, then I would say she doesn\u2019t add too much. \u2022Joy is my favorite visual\u2022 With Seulgi not far behind.  ",

            "answer_text": "Favorite songs Peek-A-Boo Bad Boy RBB Zimzalabim Psycho Members Irene : Incredibly beautiful. Can be funny when she wants to, and has a personality that comes off as shy or maybe even cold at first glance but in fact can be very warm, especially as the leader of the group. Seulgi : Awesome dancer. One of the most attractive members in my opinion, suits RV\u2019s \u201cRed\u201d concept as well as their \u201cVelvet\u201d concept but Seulgi with bangs will forever be superior. The main dancer who has a beautiful voice(SBS Gayo Daejeon 2018, Dreams Come True special stage). Wendy : My first favorite during RBB era, blonde suits her very well. Another extremely talented member with her the ability to hit insanely high notes. Again, she looks best in blonde. Joy : From what I've seen, a very entertaining member. Her smile is one of the cutest and she acts just like her name-Joy. Has many fangirls as well as fanboys and is also a good singer. Yeri : I like her rap. Especially in Peek-A-Boo, her part was the one that I enjoyed the most. Could be the visual if it wasn't for Irene, that's how pretty I think she is. Music Personally, I like their unique concepts that no other group tries. Of course, Ice Cream Cake can be a little\u2026 well, scary to be honest, but that\u2019s what makes their music entertaining to listen to. Also, songs like Dumb Dumb are very catchy and you can get easily addicted to them. Choreo Sometimes not my type, but that applies to every kpop group out there. RBB had one of the best choreos and their more mature \u201cVelvet\u201d sides, such as Bad Boy and Psycho, brings out the best of them. Style Sometimes I can't help but wonder what their stylists are thinking, I mean, what happened to Zimzalabim Wendy, but then again, unique is what Red Velvet is all about. Their outfits can be very stylish, too, which I like. Okay, hope you enjoyed reading. Bye :)  ",

            "answer_text": "I was requested to answer this so here it goes I\u2019m not a stan but I\u2019ve listened to quite a lot of their music. Just like most groups, some songs I love, some I like, others I hate. I haven\u2019t watched much of their variety/reality stuff therefore I know nothing about them personally so I can\u2019t really speak confidently on my perception of them as people. The thing is, I\u2019ve never felt the need to cause I just don\u2019t see much chemistry/passion/enthusiasm between the members and just towards their work. Like I said in my kpop unpopular ops answer, they just seem so unlikeable. I could be wrong though. Wendy\u2019s vocals are great but there\u2019s people who are better e.g. Taeyeon, most of Mamamoo, even possibly Chungha. Everyone talks about how Seulgi is the only one that has stage presence but imo, all the members attitudes when performing are pretty much alike. I actually think that the most hardworking is Wendy, she always seems so into it on stage. However, her stage presence doesn\u2019t feel natural if you get what I mean. It\u2019s like you can tell she\u2019s trying hard. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that though, we should all work hard at what we do. It\u2019s just that some people are born with it and others aren\u2019t. Everyone hates Yeri, idk why. Irene\u2019s beauty is not mindblowing. She\u2019s not necessarily that much more good looking than any of the other members. Look choreo was legendary Wendy\u2019s extreme weight loss was a bit scary. Favourite title tracks; Bad boy (best gg song of 2018), Dumb dumb (I love dumb dumb because it was one of my favourite kpop songs before I even got into kpop or really knew who red velvet was), Russian roulette, Red flavour, Ice cream cake, Peek-a-boo. I just mentioned more than half of their title tracks didn\u2019t I hahaha. Favourite non title tracks; Red dress, time slip Songs I hate (there\u2019s a lot more but this is just a few); Really bad boy, Happiness, Mojito, Kingdom come, With you, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Warning. It may be offensive since I will use other gg for comparisons. Red Velvet is my favorite girl group. Here are some of my opinions of them. They deserve more recognition. Compared to Blackpink or Twice, they didn\u2019t get that much recognition. Not to say that Blackpink or Twice is bad, but Red Velvet has more diversity and better vocals and harmony in their songs. I don\u2019t get how Ddu Du Ddu Du is a revolutionary songs when Red Velvet has so many songs including their B-side that is better or at least deserve more recognition.Irene has little stage presence. When all 5 of them performs, usually people focus more on Seulgi and Joy than Irene. Even tough Irene is the leader of the group, but the stage presence is usually centered around Seulgi or Joy, maybe even Wendy when she hits a high note. Even the amount of fancam of Seulgi is more than Irene.Irene has the best visuals among all the female artist in this generations. When we hear top visuals or best looking female artists, it\u2019s usually Jennie or Lisa or Tzuyu but never Irene. Personally I think Irene look better than any of the artist in this generations and yet her beauty is not recognize that much.",

This isn\u2019t unpopular but I feel like not many think it. Red Velvet are the queens of K-pop. I mean first or all their different styles they do. If you listen to one song and then listen to another, the only similarity you\u2019ll get is the voices. And even then, that changes. Their music is amazing, the members are all talented vocally and with dancing. They are ALL visuals. And yeah.One Of These Nights(OTN) deserved more popularity. So, OTN was about the ferry(i think) accident that killed many high school teenagers. For them to actually make a song dedicated to the lives that were lost, is amazing. And not only that, the vocals and music in general were totally fantastic. I love their voices and they go together so well. This plays in to them being to queens of K-pop.",

Seulgi seems great and everything, but for some reason I don't really care for her too much. I don't know if this was really an unpopular opinion, but Rookie was horrible. They could've done so much more with that amazing instrumental. I prefer their velvet comebacks over their red comebacks usually. But I prefer their sultry sounds, like in be natural and automatic, over everything else. I honestly never even noticed they had bad stage presence, and still kind of don't. Aside from the random screams, Really Bad Boy was pretty good. I live for the chorus. Happiness was an amazing debut song. I was playing that junk everywhere when it first came out. I didn't like Power Up that much, it felt like a downgrade from Bad Boy. I like Yeri, but I feel like she doesn't add much to the group. Now this one really isn't an opinion, but Ice Cream Cake was the song that got them popular, not Red Flavor. RF did better, but it didn't shoot them to stardom like ICC. Just wanted to point that out. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not a Reveluv but\u2026 They are NOT the queens of kpop. Seulgi is a great vocalist, dancer and performer and she carries the group on her own imo. Wendy has great vocals but lacks everything else. Stage presence of all members minus seulgi is dead. The concepts (which are given bei their agency) might be unique, but I don't think they are conveying them convincingly. Mamamoo is way more talented but Reveluvs somehow claim that RV is the best kpop group.Even though I do think that RV lack stage presence, I think people are judging them too harshly at times, especially Yeri. She's not the most talented for sure but no one deserves so much hateMany people claim that RV are akward with each other/not that close. I disagree. I think they are genuinely good friends and have lots of love for each other. They're cute and not too loud about their friendship, which I actually like better.I never found Irene that pretty. I know koreans absolutely adore her visuals but I seriously can't see it. She looks extremely average and forgettable to meI didn't like Bad Boy. Russian Roulette was their best songThis is not unpopular, but I think the girls are overall really kind and down to earth. Irene and especially Yeri get lots of hate for being rude, but I think they aren't at all. Overall the group seems calm and composed compared to other ggs. I like that about them.",

Their quirky \u201cRED\u201d side:       Then there is the sultry \u201cVelvet\u201d side:      The girls themselves are super fun and humble. And each of them has a charisma of her own.

Within that forum, the argument went both ways, one saying that k-pop idols are essentially trading their soul for instant fame whereas the counter saying that it\u2019s evident everywhere in capitalism in which farmers are resorting to GMO crops and inevitably trading their ethics for quick profit. Although I see both arguments being valid, I indeed felt bad for k-pop idols even compared to main stream artists. Artists have sensitive souls and when circumstances are not parallel to their flow, they have to resort to drastic measures. I just hope that the whole industry and the world acknowledges this and come together in protecting our artists. They are the leaders for our culture development and often are neglected after the transactions are made, which in turn produces in fallen stars. I\u2019ve heard of Irene and Red Velvet previously, but I doubt if they are ripping the scene. I presume that they\u2019d be nearly at the end of growth period of their commodity cycle as a k-pop group. They might not think that they have hit their potential yet, but I sincerely hope that they realize life is not all about becoming the #1 best selling idol in Korea. ",

They're one of the top girl groups of the third generation along with TWICE. The general public likes them, resulting in longetivity in the k-charts. In terms of personality, each member has their own charm, making each one stand out but not too much to have one member shine brighter than the others. Even with contrasting personalities (Seulgi, a nice and kind person versus Yeri, a mischievous girl and the youngest) and large age gaps (Oldest member Irene has an 8 year gap with youngest member Yeri. The second oldest, Seulgi, has a 3 year gap with the leader, Irene), chemistry does not fail to make an appearance. Overall, they're awesome girls. Kind, funny, and talented, how could you not love a girl group like Red Velvet? ",

I\u2019m not gonna lie the concept and song are kinda weird. It was really unusual but I still like it. But their agency let them experiment and try something new this is the most important thing.Irene is good visual. I can\u2019t understand people who saying that Irene is not that beautiful. Like how, she looks pretty without even trying.",

Joy, and Seulgi, however, catch the eye, and to me are more of visual goddesses than Irene. 2. Wendy\u2019s not the next Taeyeon. People tend to compare the two and say that Wendy\u2019s a better vocalist than Taeyeon. Ummmmm no? Wendy\u2019s vocals have to go a long way to reach Taeyeon\u2019s. As well, you can\u2019t compare a 2nd generation idol to 3rd because that\u2019s unfair to the 3rd generation. 3. Yeri was a good add to the group Yeri adds youth to the group and despite not being the best singer, best dancer, etc. she\u2019s still an important part of the group. She adds in diversity, being able to pull off all of their concepts. Also, she\u2019s the maknae we\u2019d all miss if she wasn\u2019t added. That\u2019s all. Hate me if you want, I don\u2019t care.

Some people honestly can\u2019t stan them, and they don\u2019t know why? Also, they do receive a lot of hate, because Wendy and Joy do gain a bit a weight from time to time, and people can\u2019t accept Yeri as a member of Red Velvet. ",

They did a sexy concept, they did a cute concept, they did an innocent concept, they did a girl crush concept, they basically did everything from 2015\u20132019. With great vocals, visuals, and dance, Red Velvet makes sure to never disappoint. All of their songs have wins, and they are all bops. I love Red Velvet\u2019s side tracks, I find them the best in K-pop. Each member has something to shine with, and for that reason, no Red Velvet members outshine the other. The summer solstices happen when Red Velvet say so, from Red Flavor to Power Up, it feels like a great summer. Reveluvs are very chill, don\u2019t hesitate to join! ",

            "answer_text": "Okay first of all this is my opinion and second of all I don\u2019t really Stan/listen to Red Velvet. Also some of these might not be unpopular. the red velvet stylist is not doing good - There have been complaints about their outfits. The latest one is Yeri\u2019s dress being short so she had to keep pulling it down as she walked up the stairs. Then there\u2019s Irene\u2019s clothes looking baggy on her; Irene has a slim figure.They have good physical albums- some complain about their physical album packaging being the same and repetitive. I personally like it.Red Velvet\u2019s light stick looks bad- I think it doesn\u2019t suit red velvets general concept and don\u2019t like how it looks in general. It looks plain and am could have done better.",

They have the best main vocalist, the best and versatile main dancer, the best visual for each member and on top of that, their songs are always bops. Try listening to Red Velvet's discography and you won't regret for the rest of your lives. Red Velvet have so much potential as a girl group and they deserve better. It's so sad to see many people praising other groups which don't really have anything much to offer as a group. These talented girls need to be recognised for their talents and their song quality. ",

I don\u2019t dislike the group, but I can\u2019t seem to get into their music. \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d is a nice bop to me, but that\u2019s about it. I find their singles catalogue pretty mediocre. I haven\u2019t heard their mini albums yet. Perhaps they have some gems there? I\u2019ll have to listen to them soon. In terms of vocals, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re all that. They have pretty tones that are desirable and they can sing, but it\u2019s nothing to write home about. Wendy has potential to be a great vocalist, but her voice is more of a hit-or-miss for me. The girls aren\u2019t terrible singers, but I do find them overrated in the vocals department. They do have phenomenal visuals and music videos though. That I will say. They have some of the best, most elaborate music videos I\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re also really beautiful girls. That\u2019s pretty much the main thing that draws me into them: their aesthetics. ",

            "answer_text": "Not so unpopular but Red Velvet is one of the most successful groups and I mean even greater than Twice, BlackPink, BTS etc. And the reason why is that even though SM is a trash company, their groups are known as individuals with successful careers as well as making a name for themselves as a group. Red Velvet like SNSD, EXO, and Super Junior are not only known for their group. Irene known as great model and labeled as one of Korea's great beauties, she could also be successful in acting and the newer movies production she is in. Seulgi as well with her beauty, she is associated with many magazines and brands. Seulgi also is known for her strong voice and being a great dancer, she would be great for future osts. And hopefully some solo work as well. Wendy, is an OST Queen. She's known for her amazing vocals, and wacky personality. One thing to be seen in multiple variety shows, it wouldn't be a surprise if she was cast as a host in one of the popular variety shows. Joy is now breaking records as one of the only unofficially solo member with her OST and featuring songs. Also known for her variety performance and vocal color, she has been cast as the host of a dog competition for ISAC. Joy also has made herself known an actress. Yerim, herself being a host of her own show interviewing A-lister celebrities, is also writing her own music. They are creating very successful solo careers for themselves which in the end accumulates to the popularity of their group. It's one of those groups where if they do disband (hopefully not anytime soon) each member will stay in the limelight, and in the celebrity world still.  ",

I always feel like Wendy looks WAYYYY better than Irene because to me, Wendy is the one where I can spot her immediately, while I have to look for Irene or listen for her voice. I'm really sorry, but Irene doesn't really appeal to me, but this is my own opinion. ",

But it is a classic Southern cake and it is often requested for family birthdays and holidays so I make it. I do use a homemade cream cheese icing, it has a lighter flavor than anything store bought and doesn\u2019t over power the cake. Done right, red velvet can be great, done wrong it\u2019s horrible. No matter what flavor cake you are making, it should be moist and light, not wet and dense. It should have an icing/frosting/glaze that compliments the cake, not overpowers it. You should want a second piece, not sit there holding your plate waiting for a chance to sneak it in the trash. ",

Real frosting for Red Velvet is cooked and has a subtle flavor that does not overpower the cake like the cream cheese frosting does. Red Velvet has a lovely chocolate flavor and is moist and delicious, if you follow the correct recipe. ",
