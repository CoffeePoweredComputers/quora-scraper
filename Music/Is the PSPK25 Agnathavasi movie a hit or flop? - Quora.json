            "answer_text": "It is a big Flop. Like many others, I too expected something from the movie. But, all my hopes got tarnished. People felt very bored in the cinema. There is almost nothing to watch in the movie. The story was good but screenplay was very bad. Heroines had not much role to play and movie is mostly cliched with bad comedy. You can visit any review websites or can ask anyone who watched the movie. Surely, you can have better things to do and visit in this sankranthi than watching this movie. This is my own opinion after watching the movie. Thank you. ",
