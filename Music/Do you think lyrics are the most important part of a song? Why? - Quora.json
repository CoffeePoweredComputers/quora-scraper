            "answer_text": "There are many ways you can take this argument: As a music enthusiast myself, I tend to value melody and rhythm immensely. After all, what's the use of good lyrics set to repetitive, predictable chord progressions, or discordant, unbearable tunes? I like songs that sound inspired, original, have some sense of creative skill.What about instrumentals? Done right, music on its own can evoke the same level of emotion as songs with lyrics, and at times they can be even more emotive. After all, composers often write pieces that are several minutes long yet never get boring despite a lack of lyrics! That would suggest the music is enough to engage interest in a song. (On a side note, lyrics without music is simply poetry; very engaging as well)On the other hand, well-phrased or powerful lyrics can deeply enhance my appreciation of a song. In some cases, songs are beautiful or influential because of their lyrics. They might have a message that resonates with societal issues, or resonates with individual experiences, and in these cases the meaning via the lyrics are very important to the song's impact.Similarly, clumsy rhymes and overused phrases distract me from enjoying a song. Lyrics which seem like a list of clich\u00e9s strung together irritate me to no end; they are evidence that the artist has been lazy and unimaginative. Much like how predictable chord progressions irritate me.Lyrics can be musical too. Just look at how beautiful poetry sounds. And when artists really pay attention to the phonetic quality of their words, they can become part of the sound and beauty of the song.So to conclude, I think it's a combination of both music and lyrics. It is also important to remember that it would be a generalisation to call the lyrics - or alternatively the music - the \"most important\" aspect of a song because different songs have different aims. For instance, a jazz artist might focus more on the melody and riffs of a song, whereas a singer/songwriter might focus more on the story they are trying to tell in a song. And of course, with instrumentals and the like, you can hardly judge their value based on lyrics! Personally, I care more about the music than the lyrics - if the music's inspired, and the lyrics aren't  bad enough to really notice, I'm up for it. That's not to say I don't appreciate great lyrics in a song, but rather that lyrics are of secondary importance to me. ",

Look up lyrics to any song, now just read them. No melody, no cadence (as you would in poetry), no rhythm. See? They\u2019re just words on a page. They may be nice words but without any structure or form or anything to back them up, that\u2019s all they are. Same thing with musical notes. Yeah they\u2019re important but now they\u2019re arranged, phrased, how well they work with other notes and the words that accompany them, they\u2019re just notes. It\u2019s kinda like asking if clay is the most important part of a sculpture. In music, it\u2019s what the artist or performer does with the words and notes that are most important. ",

            "answer_text": "Growing up, I always loved the lyrics most.  I didn't understand the complexities of musical composition then and while I still don't know much about composition, I appreciate the creativity, muse, and hard work that goes into it, the complexity and complex skillset required to make music beautiful. That being said, I still place lyrics at a very high place, because singing and vocal performance is what I love.  For stage performances, the instrumental music supports the artist's vocal expression and I will remember in bits how important it is all together, to take turns, have moments for each, pauses.  You can't sing canned, stupid lines and connect with people nearly as well as if you sing honest ones.  Lyrics that tell a story and express feelings will get across better than something that rhymes and feels cheesy.  It's hard to cringe and sing at the same time. ",

Lyrics and music together form a whole that is the basis of popular music. Lyrics can make us connect but it is the music that is memorable. Language is accessible but music is abstract and a form of language that can scintillate. It is like light or touch and more amenable to memory and feeling. The combination of lyrics and music is the key. ",

Lyrics, is and will always be the soul of a song. The songs you remember the longest are the ones which have brilliant lyrics. We still hum to the songs which stayed with us, which touched our hearts. And only songs with good lyrics could touch our heart. ",

But you like it, even if you invent the words in the shower.Melody and rythm are far more important. ",

            "answer_text": "To Me, both the lyrics and the melody are equally important. They work well together and not apart. Though the first thing a person reacts to is a melody. Melody evokes feelings that can make you feel happy, sad, relieved from unhappiness, or an outlet to let your emotions come out when you feel numb. Then, the lyrics will make a person feel if the song is good or not. A good lyric can evoke emotion of the artist that wants to convey, it can be about hope or sadness . Some of the example are \u201cLet It Be\u201d, \u201cHey Jude\u201d, \u201cBasket Case\u201d, \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d, \u201cPromised Land\u201d, \u201cTenth Avenue Freeze-out\u201d, \u201cLivin\u2019 On The Prayer\u201d etc. ",

Take Nirvana for example, I can't make out half of what Kurt Cobain is singing is some of his songs and they're still amazingly good songs. Do I enjoy good lyrics? Yes, absolutely. Are they vital? No. However, really terrible lyrics will ruin a song for me no matter how awesome the rest of it is, like Wasted by Tiesto. It's a good song, but I can't get over how unintelligent and repetitive the lyrics are to me. ",

It bothers the shit out of me when people move their lips to a song when they have no idea what the lyrics are. Having said that, I don't listen to a capella. A song is nothing without rhythm, melody and a beat. I can connect to a song through the music alone. A song can also speak to me via the lyrics. The two combined can be magical. ",
