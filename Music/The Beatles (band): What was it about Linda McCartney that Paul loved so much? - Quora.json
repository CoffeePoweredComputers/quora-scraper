            "answer_text": "Linda Eastman was a Photographer and from a known family The Eastman's. During the chunk of time when The Beatles were kind of going crazy and living in London, Linda acted purely as a POP Photographer for Rolling Stone etc.  The story goes that George fancied Linda at first, but then Paul kind of horned in on George's \"action\" and Linda was, for Paul, especially, a breathe of fresh air. An American raising a daughter, a terrifc Photographer not AT all enamoured by rock celebreties. She Photgraphed that whole late 60's English mayham. She took pics of the Stones and other known rock and roll bands.But, (and this is the truth according to many sources, Paul was not a mellow, shy guy. He was a lady's man and has stated those hotel rooms in NYC were filled with drugs and groupies and lost of partying.Linda offered a glimpse of the REAL WORLD. She was a normal career rock & roll Photographer on assignment..Course it didn't hurt that Paul, being a GEMINI was always scattered and adrift. Linda Eastman was a gentle LIBRA, shy, quiet. She NEVER wanted to tour of be in Paul's bands. She knew she didn't belong on stage.But Paul was enamored and basically forced her to be with him always.No mistake about it, though...Linda was the boss and ran the ship. Household, kids, homes in Scottland. Linda was not attracted to McCartney (she has said), but more toward Harrison. Basically, Paul loved her soft grace, humility and was quite opposite of his extroverted personality.  He married her right away and off they went to Scottland and Paul had a new type of life. Linda was vegetarian and fought for animal rights. Kids were born...Paul finally settled down.He was smitten with her talent, common sense and low-key calmness. Paul; never had that. We always wondered why in the hell he put her in Wings...no experience, couldn't play piano, BUT....(as all you 30's gentlemen know...there is a time when you are ready to love ONE soul forever,John was basically stalked by Yoko, jumping into his limo with John's wife there. Yoko went after John for one thing : HER OWN AMBITIONS. He never was interested in Yoko or her goofy art, but fate was there, John was tired of living a dull married life. Yoko showed up at his homes and basically seducded John in his weakest moments.  Later Yoko acted like Lennon was the big dog -- WE all know, Ono was calculating, and had already lost custody of her firast child (never saw her again).  In ways, Lennon was a child, never had love from his Mum. She died when he was young. Yoko filled some emotional mother / caretaker for John. We were mad that Paul got married to some strange girl and we resented her because she never spoke. She just watched and really was NORMAL compoared to the freaksof London.. P.S. Interesting side note. John Lennon was also a LIBRA...his partner Paul was a GEMINI. Paul took the breakup hard since he truly loved his old friend. But then Paul marries a LIBRA...meshed well together and I'm sure Linda had the wakky dry wit of Lennon as well as a remarkable caLM nature which meshed well with Linda. In short - PAUL GREW UP!   And Linda gave Paul the love he craved after so many loses and I bel;ieve he was just smitten as hell when he found Linda.I am glad John found a mate who shielded him from the horror of life.I am glad Paul found this NYC gal, smart, wise, and not about to take any of his crap.  YOU DID GOOD LINDA!! ",

            "answer_text": "Linda Eastman was a professional photographer. Her subjects were mainly rock stars from that time \u2026 including Jim Morrison, Mick Jagger, Jimi Hendrix, The Who \u2026 as well as Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin. Linda was the daughter of a prominent entertainment lawyer in New York (who for a short period, circa 1968) became the lawyer for each/all of The Beatles). She and Paul met in May, 1967.  First off \u2026 regarding Linda being dismissed as a groupie \u2026 (there were of course rumors were that she slept with some of the rock stars she shot \u2026 certainly Jagger had that reputation of trying hard with all the girls, and so there were strong rumors there \u2026) Of course, Paul\u2019s had previously been engaged twice, most recently at Christmastime 1967, to actress Janer Asher \u2014 she was a well-known child actress in England, and brother of Peter Asher of \u201cPeter and Gordon\u201d \u2026 Paul lost her in June 1968 when she caught him sleeping with another woman (not Linda \u2026). And, to be fair \u2026 George\u2019s second/last wife Olivia was a secretary at Dark Horse Records, the record company George formed in 1974. So, you know, these were the women the guys would meet, etc. I don\u2019t know that they were greatly bothered or anything about this subject - neither the women nor the men. Point being, Paul associated with prominent women who were familiar with the entertainment industry \u2026 so both Asher and Eastman were familiar with the life style in the industry, etc. Bottom line: I wouldn\u2019t call Linda a groupie, not at all \u2026 she was prominent in her own right .  As for how Paul and Linda met: It was at the Bag O\u2019 Nails after-hours club in London, May 15, 1967 \u2026 McCartney (along with Ringo) was celebrating the impending release of Sgt. Pepper (BTW, Bag O\u2019 Nails is one of the after-hours clubs where Hendrix was first seen by the \u2018rock royalty\u2019 at this time as well). Ms. Eastman was there with Chas Chandler (Hendrix\u2019s manager) and other members of The Animals (tho this was not the night Jimi was playing-and-seen by Paul \u2026 tho you can bet Chas told Paul, \u2018hey come see THIS guy\u2019 \u2026 and Paul did - two days after Sgt. Pepper was released {May 29} Jimi played a psychedelic version of \u201cSgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d in front of McCartney/Clapton/Townshend at just such an after hours club .. for the full story of that night, the 29th, see: Thomas J. Beaver's answer to Was Jimi Hendrix aware of just how good he was as a guitarist?) McCartney remembers that he caught Eastman\u2019s eye that night. Paul said that he was attracted to her smile (so \u2026 that\u2019s what he saw \u2026 to answer the question in the narrowest sense). \u201cThe band had finished and Linda and the Animals got up to either leave or go for a drink or a pee or something, and she passed our table. I was near the edge and stood up just as she was passing, blocking her exit. And so I said, \u2018Oh, sorry. Hi. How are you? How\u2019re you doing?\u2019 I introduced myself, and said, \u2018We\u2019re going on to another club after this, would you like to join us?\u2019 That was my big pulling line! Well, I\u2019d never used it before, of course, but it worked this time! It was a fairly slim chance but it worked.\u201d McCartney and Eastman would meet again a few days later at Beatles manager Brian Epstein\u2019s house in London. Eastman sought to shoot photos of the Beatles, and Epstein agreed for her to come to a press party for Sgt. Pepper on May 19. She took more than a few famous shots of the boys (for a photo book she was putting together, Rock and Other Four Letter Words), but she also had her photo taken \u2013 the first posed-picture of the future Mr. and Mrs. McCartney. But, after that, McCartney and Eastman went their separate ways for a year \u2026 McCartney even got engaged to longtime girlfriend Jane Asher in Dec. 1967. In May 1968, McCartney met Eastman again in New York, when Lennon and McCartney were there to announce the formation of Apple Corps. In late June the engagement of McCartney and Jane Asher was broken off. And in September 1968, McCartney phoned Linda and asked her to fly over to London. Six months later \u2026 they were married at a small civil ceremony.  DID YOU KNOW: Linda Eastman was first attracted to \u2026 John (well, to Mick Jagger before that, etc. \u2026 see above) DID YOU KNOW #2: Paul and Linda\u2019s \u2018song\u2019 was Procol Harum\u2019s \u201cWhiter Shade of Pale.\u201d On that first night, May 15, 1967, Linda has said that she and Paul, and everyone there, were talking about this brand new song (released May 12), and people were saying the singer had to be Stevie Winwood. \u2026 and how about this \u2026 Procol Harum was on the bill that second night, May 29 \u2026 it was the Saville Theater \u2026 so Paul found out first-hand who sang the sing \u2026 and May 19th happens to be the singer, Gary BOoker\u2019s birthday! (and mine!) \u2026 see: (this, below, has been called a shot of Paul and Linda on the night they met \u2026 dunno if that\u2019s accurate or not, but here it is)  ",
