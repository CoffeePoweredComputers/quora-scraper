            "answer_text": "You should prepare songs in a language that you can speak fluently, so don\u2019t do ones in Korean if you can\u2019t speak a word of Korean. If you can speak Korean at an intermediate level, then I would try to do a song in Korean, although the judges may judge your pronunciation of the song. As for genres, probably kpop, pop or jpop (once again depending on what language you can speak) or any other genre that you enjoy/feel confident in singing. Song choice is up to you but these are some pop songs that I would use for my audition. Flashlight - Jessie J In The Name of Love - Martin Garrix and Bebe Rexha(probably do a verse because you will most likely sing acapella and there is a huge pause in the chorus so) Scared To Be Lonely - Martin Garrix and Dua Lipa Sunflower - Post Malone Clementine - Halsey(I would do a verse because in the chorus she sings \u2018i don't need anyone\u2019 and then she screams \u2018i don't need anyone!\u2019 and the same with \u2018i just need everyone\u2019) Bellyache - Billie Eilish(her vocals are quite high so if you are not a soprano, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this one) Lily - Alan Walker(gets high in the chorus so either use a verse or don\u2019t do it if you are not soprano) Faded - Alan Walker(is high but not ridiculously high so it should be manageable) Lover - Taylor Swift(high in the chorus) Graveyard - Halsey If you are doing rap for your audition: Black Widow - Iggy Azalea and Rita Ora(there is singing but just use one of the verses, verse 1 is easier than verse 2) Admit It - Tati McQuay See You Again - Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Put(rap bits are a bit short) Nightmare - Halsey And if you are dancing (I don\u2019t have any choreography, but you can google these songs and see if there are videos with choreographies to them): Rescue Me - One Republic I Like It - Cardi B(I recommend the one Lisa did) Ice Ice Baby - Vanilla Ice Work Hard, Play Hard - DJ Jason Medallion Bury a Friend - Billie Eilish(Galen Hooks and Tina Boo are good ones) idontwannabeyouanymore - Billie Eilish Sweet but Psycho - Ava Max(Mina Myoung was one I liked) ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, so it really depends on the company, your vocal range, and weather you can speak Korean or not. If you can speak Korean then I would do a song in Korean to show that. But if you can't, then don't. This is a big thing a lot of people underestimate. The company's specifically say that they judge your pronunciation of the song. And if you are not Korean they might let you in because they think that you are bilangual, when you are not. As for song choice, this is really up to you. I can give some songs if you want to sing in Korean, but if you don't want to you can just skip this next section\u2026 Twice- Fancy, Feel special, Dance the night away, what is love. I would only do twices songs for any company other than the big 3. Twices songs are mostly soprano, but I guess if you are an Alto you could make them work. BTS- Lights, Save me, Magic shop. (I could probably do like 80 more, but I kept it small) I would only do a BTS song if you were going to audition for a smaller company. Their songs are mostly for Alto's and Bases. Stray kids- Get Cool, I am you, awkward silence, hellevator. Their songs are good for any company but the big 3. I would only do their songs if you naturally have a bit of a lower voice but can still sing some high notes. Black Pink- Kill this Love, Du-ddu-du-ddu-du. I personally would not audition for any company with their songs because of their companys reputation. Their songs are for Alto's and sopranos. Also be prepared to song multiple auditions if you are doing a global audition. That's all I could think of right now. Good luck on your audition :) ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have any specific songs that you could sing, because I don\u2019t know your vocal range. But what I can say, is that you sing a song that you are comfortable with, and is within your vocal range completely. Another thing is, that maybe you shouldn\u2019t do a kpop song. Or at the very least, not a kpop song from the company that you\u2019re auditioning for. If you do a kpop song, it is highly likely that your judges will think that it\u2019s just because you like kpop so much to the point that you are willing to audition. If you\u2019re singing a kpop song from the company, it just makes you seem like a desperate fan that\u2019s wanting to get close to their idols, and that\u2019s not good, like not good at all, because it could seriously hinder your audition. Being a fan is a terrible thing to come off as when auditioning, and you should steer yourself clear from that. Although you can mention your love for Kpop, it\u2019s best not to be too enthusiastic when talking about your faves, because trust, it\u2019s pretty obvious to the judges, and they don\u2019t like fans. Remember what happened to GLAM (girl group from BigHit)? Well, it turns out that one of the members was a sasaeng fan. Of whom, I\u2019m not entirely sure, but you get the idea. Hope this helped! ",

However, practice it vigorously and ask others, preferably those who speak Korean, if you sound like a native speaker. If you sound confident in the language, then the judges will definitely remember you. DO NOT SING A SONG FROM A GROUP/SOLOIST THAT THE COMPANY MANAGES. The judges have probably heard songs like these for ages and you want to stand out. I wouldn\u2019t recommend singing a song from a rival company (if you\u2019re auditioning for JYP perhaps, you probably shouldn\u2019t sing a song from a YG or SM group and vice versa). Pick a song that you know will leave a lasting impression on the judges. Do one that you know you can sing perfectly when the occasion calls for it. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to have high notes and belts and such. Just do one that you can sing flawlessly. And do one within your vocal range! If you strain too much, they will notice! These judges have to pick only a few trainees out of hundreds of people auditioning. If you have even the slightest slip up, that could be enough to knock you out of the competition. Be confident. Smile. And remember this: no matter what the outcome is, you will hopefully learn something that will help you in the future, whether it regards music or it regards life. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Okay so, here are some reccomendations over how to chose a song : If you don\u2019t know Korean or how to pronounce Korean words DONT sing a song in Korean.Sing a song to fit your voice if you are a Soprano, don\u2019t try to sing singularity (at least on its original key), and if you are a baritone don\u2019t sing What is love.Choose a song you would feel comfortable singing, if your vocal range is not very wide , do not sing Mariah Carey songs, or basically songs that are difficult for you. On the other hand if you can reach the high notes I would reccomend you to chose maybe not a difficult song, but a song that showcases your voice.If you want really want to sing a kpop song then I would recommend songs like eyes, nose, lips, an IU song, Ailee OSTs, etc. I would recommend you to sing solo songs instead of group songs as solo songs are designed for a soloist while group songs are designed for well\u2026groups. (This are some recommendations, chose the song that adapts better to your voice).The same reccomendation if you would like to sing on English, Japanese, French, etc. Other songs I would recommend Hurt by Christina Aguilera, Disney or Musical Songs (although I don\u2019t think singing opera would be suitable for the ocation), Halo by Beyonc\u00e9, etc.This is it, I hope this helped you to chose a song in some way. Good luck :). ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your vocal range and the company. Two important things. Prepare 2 songs - one ballad and one \u201ccatchy\u201d tune. Make sure you\u2019re as perfect at both of them as can be. Then listen to the others around you, if everyone is doing w ballad use your pop song, and vice verse. But make sure to pick songs that show your range. Second, whoever you are auditioning for do not use a song from their company. Just don\u2019t, kiss of death. If you\u2019re using a track with back up vocals with just one person missing make sure you stick to their part. If you\u2019re using a solo artist no worries. Make sure you can hit all the notes, if it\u2019s beyond your range don\u2019t do it. Use songs that work for you. I know I\u2019m not suggesting particular songs (my daughter used Twinkle by TaeTiSo) but I don\u2019t know your range or whether you\u2019re a soprano 1, 2 or an alto 1 or 2. I don\u2019t know how high of a note (or low) you can hit (and hold). So I advise you to pick songs you like (old or new) and see what fits your voice best. Sing it accapella in front of family or friends. If it fits you and you do well, there\u2019s your song(s) - you could be asked to sing a second if they really like the first. ",

So you have to find this out yourself. I can give suggestions but you don\u2019t have to rap these songs only. If you are not so good in korean i.e your pronunciation, flow, etc. Are not good it is better to try an English Rap. You can try- Rap God (I\u2019ve tried the fastest verse of this one, its not that hard if you pay full attention to it) Speedom (Well this is umm\u2026best of luck,I still have to try this so maybe you can) These are REALLY Fast so there is a greater chance of you making it with these if you can do it perfectly with that swag, flow, speed & body language. You can try any eminem or busta rhymes raps. They are amazing. If you are Really good in korean and you are sure that you won\u2019t make any pronunciation mistake (Knowing hangul will help with this), you can go for any of the BTS\u2019s Rap songs like cypher pt.3, cypher pt.2 , Outro:tear, Agust D, The Last, Joke, Intro:What am I to you, Intro: Nevermind,Intro:Persona etc. I would also suggest checking out Epik High because his raps are really amazing. You can even try Doom Dada by T.O.P. But same applies here \u201cif you can do it perfectly with that swag, flow, speed & body language.\u201d As your name says you are probably Indian. Please don\u2019t mislead yourself in doing any Indian rap song because you cannot get in with Hindi songs. Only english and korean is allowed. And even if Hindi was allowed I would have suggested to avoid most famous Indian rappers and try out people like Gully Boy\u2019s raps (Real one okay? Not the actor). Because let\u2019s be Honest Honey Singh, also known as, Yo Yo Honey Singh was one of the first well known Indian rapper but his songs actually made me hate Raps. I thought Raps are useless and cringey till I found out BTS and Eminem (I would also Mention BTOB). Badshah has some swag but at the international level and especially, our topic kpop\u2019s raps, his raps are upto the Girl group level raps. In English too, please don\u2019t do Drake\u2019s raps even if He is very popular. His raps are not actually raps. I speak faster than that. And there is hardly any swag that makes you go \u201cWoah!\u201d. I am not hating. I respect tgem really very much but just saying this so that you can plan out well. Because their raps are not going to work. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Never auditioned for a kpop group or company but have auditioned for a school in the arts before. You should sing what ever is comfortable with your vocals. Singing takes strength and energy. If you sing a song requiring you to reach notes that you can\u2019t or have not mastered yet, will harm your voice and most likely interfere with your results. Best thing to do is know your range. If they ask you to sing a specific song, maybe take a course on how to read music and find a key that will be in tune with another. If you can\u2019t sing high, learn to compensate with singing a lower tone. But still sounds great. Nothing is worse than having a voice croak or squeak whilst trying to sing in tune with the music. From my experience, the worst part of my audition was that I could not sing the high notes well enough to pass, id squeak or croak\u2026 it made the playback video unbearable to watch. Comfortable but still impressive for your range. ",

If your talent is rap try songs by San-E, Zico, RM, Dynamic Duo, Simon Dominic, and Epik High. ",

            "answer_text": "I love the K-pop song \u201cdon\u2019t cry\u201d by EXO. The inspiration of this song is The Little Mermaid written in 1837. When the little mermaid turns 15, she falls in love with a prince. She asks the Sea Witch to give her legs in exchange for her voice. She hopes the prince would marry her and suffers a lot of pain for him but fails. The prince decides to marry the neighboring king\u2019s daughter. Before dawn the little mermaid\u2019s sisters bring her a knife from the Sea Witch. If she kills the prince with the knife and lets his blood drip onto her feet, she will become a mermaid again. But when she stands in front of his bed, she can not bring herself to do that. When the sun rises, she throws herself into the sea and her body dissolves into foam. In the song \u201cBaby Don\u2019t Cry\u2019, the prince doesn't sleep, he wakes up and asks her to kill him. Don't hesitate, please take my heart. Baby dont cry tonight. When the dawn lights the skies, it will be as if nothing ever happened. You will never dissolve into foam, for my love is with you forever. So, baby dont cry cry.\u2019\u201d ",

Don\u2019t challenge yourself to the point of breaking, or do something off-brand just to show you can. Also, don\u2019t pick a song that is a big hit released by the same agency. The judges will have heard it a million times and will more easily pick up any small mistakes compared to the professional idols that have performed it dozens if not hundreds of times. That\u2019s about all the advice I can give without knowing what agencies you are interested in or what kind of music you like. ",

Its an unspoken rule. I personally like to use the song \u201cBreathe\u201d by Lee Hi for my auditions but when it came to me having to use a different song I either sang \u201cstill love you\u201d by Lee Hong Ki or \u201cLet me Know\u201d by \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8. When it comes to auditions, I like to free myself with each song I choose, so when I auditioned I auditioned with Bruno Mars, Bangtan, Lee Hi, Lee Hong Ki, Eminem, NF, and other artists. It\u2019s really good to show diversity in your song choices and if you\u2019re bilingual or know other languages to also choose a song in that language that you can do to show off your skills in another language. Hope this helped! ",
