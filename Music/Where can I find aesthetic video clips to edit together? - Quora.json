Searching up \u2018aesthetic\u2019 on either of those will have a lot of videos. Tags like #lofiedit and #chillvibes have a lot of short aesthetic clips. you can also construct your own. Find aesthetic pictures and make animations or paste gifs onto them. Or find nice videos and add a grain or vhs filter onto them. The app VHS cam on the App Store is a great buy. you really have to scour the internet to find this stuff, but it\u2019s there. It\u2019s definitely a skill and gets easier once you start stockpiling and saving anything you might like. ",
