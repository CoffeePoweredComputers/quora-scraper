            "answer_text": "There are several factors that go into mental health and it can be difficult to quantify which factor has the biggest effect. For general mental health, if it came down to it, I\u2019d say the biggest factor is your environment. Your environment dictates the people you surround yourself with as well as your lifestyle (diet, exercise.) The people you surround yourself with also affect your lifestyle. Surrounding yourself with healthy people will make it easier for you to live a healthy lifestyle, have a better diet, get regular exercise. Everyone knows diet and exercise are important factors for mental health. Why? Well, superficially, your skin will look better if you eat healthier. You\u2019ll be more toned if you exercise regularly. This will give you confidence, raise your self esteem, and in turn, create more positive thoughts about yourself, thereby helping your overall mental health. On a deeper level, healthy food (less sugar, less processed foods, ext.) and regular exercise release endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin. These chemicals are important in regulating mood. In the words of the great Elle Woods: Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don\u2019t kill their husbands. If you live in an environment where the people you interact with are rude and negative more often than not, those are the people you\u2019ll become friends with or you\u2019ll decide \u201cF you all. I\u2019ll be a loner.\u201d Then you\u2019ll just be extremely lonely. Loneliness = bad. Simply put, humans are social creatures. We NEED others. (Side note: Google skin hunger. It\u2019s an intriguing concept.) Isolated people are significantly more likely to have mental health issues such as depression and addiction. The point I\u2019m trying to make is your mental health will benefit greatly if you live in an environment that\u2019s healthy, where you\u2019re able to surround yourself with positive people who love you and support you.

            "answer_text": "Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions \u2014 disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors. Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function. A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy). Some of the factors that affect the mental health are as follows: Family breakup or loss Separation or divorce or the loss of a parent or sibling is extremely painful. Finding ways to cope and adjust to the changes wrought by these events is critical for everyone, but particularly for youth. How grief is handled can affect young people negatively for years to come. If children are having difficulty coping, professional help is recommended. Difficult behaviour When people are unhappy, they either internalize their unhappiness or act out. The latter usually appears as bad or difficult behaviour, such as using abusive language, being aggressive or violent, damaging property, stealing, lying, refusing to comply with requests or expectations at school or home, or displaying other inappropriate actions. If such behaviour is serious and persistent, the young person and his or her family might require professional help. Physical ill health Diseases, injuries and other physical problems often contribute to poor mental health and sometimes mental illness. Some physical causes (such as birth trauma, brain injury or drug abuse) can directly affect brain chemistry and contribute to mental illness. More commonly, poor physical health can affect self-esteem and people\u2019s ability to meet their goals, which leads to unhappiness or even depression. In such cases, receiving the best possible treatment for both the physical problem and the resulting psychological consequences is key to optimal recovery to good mental health. Abuse The mental health of abused children is at great risk. Abused children are more likely to experience mental illness during childhood and into adulthood. Abuse may be physical, sexual, psychological or verbal. It may not always be evident or easily recognized. Regardless of the form it takes, abuse cannot be tolerated. Children need to be protected from abuse and helped to overcome its negative effects. Abuse can cause feelings of low self-esteem, lack of self-confidence, depression, isolation and anger all feelings that impair a child\u2019s chance to lead a happy life.
