            "answer_text": "Telling your parents is the easy bit. Actually realising your ambition is the tough bit. There must be 50 billion kids out there all wanting exactly the same thing. Out of those, chances are maybe one will find any success at all, usually because of who they know rather than because of any real talent. So dont put all your hopes into one basket. You may think you are a great singer, doesnt mean its true. If you have had no formal training there is little chance your singing will be up to much. If you are serious about making singing your career you need to expect to spend a lot of money and put in many hours of training with a professional singing coach for a good few years to attain any form of reasonable standard. Maybe even then you will get nowhere with it. Im not trying to put down your dreams, just explaining the harsh realities of the music business. Its tough out there. The competition is fierce. The critics are viscious. Anyone can sing, very few can sing well enough to make a career out of it. Even the ones that do, their music careers are very short lived. They can be popular one day and forgotten the next. With this in mind always have a back up career. Something you can fall back on when times get hard, and they will. To make it in the music world, you need plenty of talent, a very thick skin and a backbone strong enough to carry the weight of the world plus an immeasurable amount of luck. Back to the main question. How to tell your parents. Instead of simply just coming out and telling them what you want, try bringing the subject up in conversation. Ask them how they think singers get to be popular and successful. Listen closely to their opinions, this will give you an idea of what they think about it before telling them you have an interest in it. If their thoughts on the subject are generally negative you know you can expect an equally negative response. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume the reason for your anxiety is that you want to do this professionally and you believe that they'll want you to do something more practical. If this is the case, I think there are steps to take before saying that's what you want to do with your life. Maybe casualy mention that you'd like to take singing and instrument lessons. If they can't afford something like that, let them know that you're going to try to learn to sing in your room and that's why they'll hear all these weird noises (you make weird noises when you warm up). At that point, you'll want to watch some vocal coaching videos on YouTube, starting with ones about warming up and cooling down. Practice, practice, practice. Unless you're extremely naturally talented, it can take a while to sound good, and don't be afraid to ask for your parents\u2019 opinions. Ask for brutal honesty. You'll need to get used to it in order to get better. Sing in a choir or school chorus, hit as many open mics as you can, and talent shows once you're really confident; hell, even karoake is good to open you up to performing in front of people. So you know how to write songs, learn music theory! Don't listen to the people who say you don't need it or that it detracts from your creativity. It's never a bad thing to know more, but so that it doesn't detract from your creativity, understand that you don't have to follow all the rules \u2014 what sounds good to you is good. There are plenty resources online for music theory, especially musictheory.net (you can ignore everything that has to do with four-part writing). It helps a lot to learn an instrument but I would argue that, in this day and age, it's crucial to learn a DAW (digital audio workstation). REAPER is what I use and it has an essentially unlimited free trial. YouTube tutorials are your friends. After a period of consistently getting better, you may not even have to tell your parents you want a career in music because they'll assume that that's what you're going for. Get good and squash their doubts! ",
