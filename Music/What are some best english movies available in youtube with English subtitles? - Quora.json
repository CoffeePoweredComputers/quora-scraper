            "answer_text": "There are many movies available for you and I would recommend you to sort out the best movies based on its genre. The best way to do that would be with the help of the movie review sites like IMDB and rotten tomatoes. In case of you love adventure then pick up the best films listed by the website. Both these sites are being rated by both the professional movie critic and by movie lovers like us. If you still do not find the particular movie in YouTube then I would recommend you to download it from Torrentz if your nation permits downloading. PS: If its a new film then I always recommend you to watch in a theatre. There is no replacement for that. ",
