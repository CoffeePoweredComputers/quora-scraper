            "answer_text": "What artist use Les Paul\u2019s ONLY\u2026I can\u2019t think of any of the top of my head. There\u2019s artists that are associated with the Les Paul Model. Now, if we quibble, someone like, say Slash\u2026He actually used a \u201959 burst Les Paul REPLICA. Jimmy Page- The lead guitar on \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d was a TELECASTER when they recorded in in the studio. Clapton used Les Pauls, SG\u2019s, ES-335\u2019s, but is now mostly associated with Stratocasters. George Harrison was gifted a Gibson Les Paul by Clapton, but he was more often seen with Strats, Rics, Epiphones, and the Rosewood Telecaster. Randy Rhoads used a Alpine White Les Paul Custom that the band Quiet Riot had bought for him. He was always looking for other sounds and started exploring with Grover Jackson on a different guitar. Hence the \u2018shark fin\u2019 RR guitars. Lindsey Buckingham was being pushed by Mick Fleetwood and John McVie to play Les Pauls. They wanted to get that Peter Green kind of feel, but he just didn\u2019t like the tone, it wasn\u2019t what he was looking for. So, he played Strats and Tele\u2019s and Rics and Pauls until he found his sound with Rick Turner. So, what\u2019s my point? Lots of people play lots of guitars,to service the song. One notable exception is Brian May, who build his own guitar. John Deacon had given him a Telecaster to do \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love\u201d, so that\u2019s on the studio album (Deacy though it was a \u2018proper rockabilly guitar). Brian may eventually realized that any sound the Tele could make, the Red Special could make. And, he has gone back to almost exclusively playing his original Red Special. He does have some replica\u2019s to fill in if a string breaks, or tuned differently for some songs. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Jimmy Page: The Led Zeppelin guitarist\u2019s choice of the Les Paul added much of the band\u2019s trademark heaviness to their sound. 2. Slash: Some of Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019most iconic riffs were created on a Les Paul, like the ones in \u201cWelcome to the Jungle\u201d and \u201cSweet Child O\u2019 Mine.\u201d 3. Ace Frehley: The Spaceman wasn\u2019t just known for his make-up, he was also renowned for his Les Paul, which he used to create the music for \u201cCold Gin,\u201d \u201cShock Me\u201d and many other Kiss hits. 4. Eric Clapton: Clapton has used many guitars during his career, but some of his most iconic axes were Les Pauls. They\u2019re what defined his time in The Yardbirds and John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers, and helped shape some solo music too. 5. Randy Rhoads: Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s legendary guitarist used his classical guitar skills with his white Les Paul to help mold the Prince of Darkness\u2019s heavy metal sound and add memorable parts to hits like \u201cCrazy Train\u201d and \u201cMr. Crowley.\u201d 6. Joe Perry: During his time in Aerosmith, Joe has played just about every kind of Les Paul that\u2019s come out in the past three decades. He owns hundreds of guitars, many of which are Les Pauls, no doubt because they were behind some of the band\u2019s classics. 7. Duane Allman: Some of the most unforgettable Allman Brothers Band solos came from Duane\u2019s Les Pauls. Even though he was just 24 when he died, Duane was able to pull a sound from the guitar that lives on with his legacy. 8. Zakk Wylde: Randy Rhoads wasn\u2019t Ozzy\u2019s only guitarist to rock a Les Paul \u2013 Zakk Wylde did too. With his bull\u2019s-eye axe, Zakk made a name for himself, making some outstanding music with Oz, Black Label Society and on his own. 9. Steve Jones: A Les Paul helped dictate what punk music was, thanks to the Sex Pistolsguitarist, who used his aggressive styles to create the band\u2019s music. 10. Pete Townshend: Townshend has experimented with all different guitars, but some of his biggest songs were written on Les Paul Deluxes. The instrument also defined his performances in the \u201870s since his iconic windmill strums would have seemed wrong on a smaller guitar. ",
