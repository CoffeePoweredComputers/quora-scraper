            "answer_text": "Some of it is just endurance gained over time. It's been a while since I've had a gig, so if I were to try to go do a 4 hour show I probably wouldn't be able to finish the second set. My voice is out of shape for that, just due to lack of doing it. But I used to do 4 hour gigs once or twice a week. The tricks I used were: 1. Plan your setlist to put the most strenuous songs at the end of a set, right before a break, or barring that, make sure you have 2-3 easy (vocally) songs after a tough one. If other band members sing, let one of them sing the next song so you can rest your voice. The point is to let your voice rest right after you've pushed it hard. 2. Try not to talk on breaks. Let your voice rest, and drink water. I also liked to get away from the room, to somewhere quiet, so my ears could rest too. Being on stage is loud. 3. Be well rested before a gig. On Friday night gigs I would try to take the day off of work so I could sleep in, or at least take the afternoon off to rest (not sleep, just relax and be rested). 4. Stick to songs that fit in your comfortable range. That doesn't mean never hit a high note; use them sparingly but to good effect. Don't try to spend the whole night singing at the top of your range, you'll hurt yourself. Even a racecar can't run in the red the whole time. As for specific vocal techniques I can't really tell you what I did. I can tell when I'm straining, and sometimes I would postpone or drop a song if I thought it would be too much. If there's a high note that's hard to reach, figure out a couple easier ways to sing it, and keep them in your pocket. If you feel like you're straining too much, use one of the easier ways. Play it by ear. I promise, the crowd won't care. ",

Of course, singers have a trained voice, and the more you sing, the more your voice can endure over time. But in the beginning I sung two songs and my throat got sore, and now I can sing much more songs at a time. But it of course also depends on the person singing, and not every person can sing for as long as their idol can. But I found I can sing for longer times the more I sing and practise. I had the same question in mind when I started singing, but it has solved itself over time ",

You can find books on basic vocal technique for everyone from opera to pop for very reasonable prices.  Check out the line of vocal methods in Hal Leonard.  If you can afford it a teacher can be of great help in showing you the proper warm up techniques.  Unfortunately, I didn't learn this until I was in my 70's and by then had limited myself to about a 1/2 hour.  I still sing for fun, but wish I had found out about warming up earlier.  ",
