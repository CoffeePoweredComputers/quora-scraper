            "answer_text": "One of the things any musician has heard many many times from facility owners ( Bars, restaurants, venues ) is : You should play for the exposure! This is probably one of the most hateful, dishonest, greedy, and immoral things one can say to any performer. Let me also add that some of this way of thinking has been, and is encouraged by some musicians themselves. Let me explain: Musicians can generally be divided into two groups; 1) Professional ( Those who make their living as musicians ) 2) Hobbyists, or non-professional ( those who do not make their primary living as musicians ) The problem stems from number 2. Many hobbyists and non professional musicians love to perform on weekends or other occasions because they enjoy it, or it provides a sense of artistic relief in that they feel it is a very important part of who they are, or for many other reasons I won\u2019t go into right now. This is great, as it helps promote live performance, and certainly entertains the audience they are playing for. Here\u2019s the problem: Very often, they agree to play in a club or restaurant or other public place either for free, or for a ridiculously small fee. They have a regular job which supports their living needs, and so are willing to perform for free or next to free because it is fun, and they really don\u2019t need the money anyway. What they are inadvertently doing is giving away their services, and removing a possible gig for a professional, who really needs it to pay the rent this month. Restaurant and bar and venue owners will of course take advantage of this situation, to up their profit, by hiring hobbyists for next to no money. So after a while, whatever pittance they are paying becomes \u201cthe norm\u201d. When approached by a professional musician, they will offer the same pittance as they give the \u201cweekenders\u201d, or are told they should play \u201cfor the exposure\u201d. I\u2019ve yet to convince my landlord to accept some of my exposure as payment for my rent. When I was a young man first starting out, I played in many different bars, restaurants, etc and made a very good living at it. There was an organization called the AFM or American federation of musicians, otherwise known as the musicians union. At that time, in my location, you couldn\u2019t play in any public place without being a member of the union. There was a minimum scale payment set for just about any type of job, and the Union was very pro-active in enforcing it. What that situation created was an equal playing field for all performers, professional or not, and also made the public, and all venues realize that there was value in what performers provided, and just like any other profession, performers deserved to be rewarded for their services. My dad had an 18 piece dance band. He also had a day job which paid his living expenses. All the band members, including myself were paid at least union scale. So it was impossible for a venue of any type to offer less than that, because in order to hire entertainment, they had to sign an agreement with the union which forbade them from having unpaid, or underpaid (less than scale) entertainment. Not that unions are all that great, but in this particular area, it allowed musicians to make a decent living plying their craft, and protected them from greedy and dishonest venue owners. Of course one could say: If I don\u2019t agree to work for nothing or next to it, I\u2019ll never get a gig. Well this is where self respect, and respect for your fellow musicians comes in. If venue owners can\u2019t get it for free, they will have to pay. It\u2019s about sticking together, even though the AFM has lost it\u2019s relevancy, mostly because hobbyists have lowered the bar to such a degree that they will undercut, and undercut, to get the gig, until there are no paid gigs at all. Just to beat this topic to death, here is an analogy for you: Say for some quirky reason, I had a passion for plumbing! So I start going out in my spare time doing plumbing jobs for people for little or no money, because I enjoyed it. How do you think professional plumbers would react when they heard about what I was doing? The answer is obvious, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be pretty! The question I\u2019ve been asking myself for my entire career is why am I not given the same respect as a plumber. I studied for twenty years, practiced my butt off to get really good at what I do, went to University to further my studies, and now you want me to work for free? Anyone would be insulted by this. The answer to this problem is to spread the word to all musicians, but especially the part timers, to demand what you should be paid for the service you provide. This has nothing to do with how good you think you are, or what others think of you. If all musicians were to just stop accepting this onerous disrespect that society in general, and specifically those who hire musicians and performers perpetrate on us, then things might begin to change for the better, and what is right will prevail. I know this is a pipe dream, but by sharing this with all who may read it, maybe it will at least bring the issue into the public space, and slowly change what has degenerated into a despicable, disgusting, and totally dishonest situation, perpetuated by those who would profit on our vulnerability. So to answer your question, YES you\u2019re darn tootin\u2019 musicians should be paid!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hell yeah. You ever played on a stage? It's very tough on mind and body, much more than a nonmusician (or even a musician without much stage experience) would think. Instruments are heavy, and playing them requires very detailed motor skills that can be tough on the joints and ligaments. Not to mention the drummers! Those men and women are damn heroes. Every instrument, including vocals, requires some degree of stress and strain on the body. This adds up over a few one hour sets in a row. Doing all of the required mechanical movements while also bringing an energetic stage presence to the audience for three hours is totally exhausting. And then there's the fact that musicians on average probably practice about 10-20 solid hours for every of minute of music they play live - at a minimum. Any mistake can throw off a song, and let down both the audience and your bandmates. Or if you prefer to look at it as a simple matter of economics, it is a widely known fact that live music in a bar will bring in more customers, keep them there longer, and in many cases make them drink more. Bars should (and do) compete economically to bring in the best musicians as a pure matter of profit. So in conclusion, we're talking about a highly skilled, valuable and labor-intensive talent. Ergo, musicians should absolutely be paid for live performances. QED. ",
