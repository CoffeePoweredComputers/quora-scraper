            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t consider myself to be old k-pop fan, but I got once into k-pop when BAP debuted, and am fan of older kpop groups too. GG, TVXQ, Suju, Shinee, 2pm, BigBang, \u2026 so I decided to somehow write my opinion. I think that the way k-pop is changing and new trends in k-pop are really cool. I like songs that were released before year 2010 a lot too and I can\u2019t possibly tell which trend I consider to be better, but the way newer groups are, I think they are on a good way. BTS did quite a lot with all their concept Love Yourself, but beside that, there are many other amazing artists. Overall music that SM releases is always and probably will always be good. Trend changes, they are trying to not keep up with trend, but to make new trends. They are doing what they were always doing. I\u2019m going to mention NCT, because I think that their music is a good example of direction k-pop is slowly taking. BTS have songs that appeal to west a lot, EXO has strong fanbase in Korea, Seventeen are now becoming one of the best selling k-pop groups too, Got7, NCT and maybe even Monsta X are coming for the top. I like all of their music. I think that NCT\u2019s Simon Says and Regular are unique, to a lot of people weird, but still really amazing songs. I like TVXQ\u2019s Mirotic, but I also love their new song Truth (actually whole album is art). They released The Chance of Love at the start of 2018 (I believe) and that song was one of the best of the ones released that year. Groups that debuted since 2018 - Stray Kids, ATEEZ, ITZY and soon TXT are probably groups that will be one of the leading groups of kpop in few years. If groups that are coming for the top, together with new debuted groups are the future of k-pop, we have nothing to worry about.  or do we? ",

            "answer_text": "I mean, when you\u2019ve been exposed to anything for so long you start seeing the patterns, routines, systematic under-workings, etc and the fascination wears thin in due time. However, there is certainly some newer music I like such as SuperM, WayV, NCT 127, etc I think they\u2019re generally trying to be stronger in attitude by Western standards, often dressing a bit more normal instead of so extreme on the fashion trends. I mean if you look at SHINee Lucifer video or older EXO videos, they look like they\u2019re from the future with very edgy, bigger than life outfits often with very sensual erotic overtones\u2026 compare that to modern videos they just look fashionable but pretty normal where people might actually wear the clothing they wear in music videos today. One exception being NCT 127 with SuperHuman, their clothing in that did feel closer to classic Kpop that I was used to seeing 10 years ago. This tone down in their clothing though seems to have lessened the creativity of modern Kpop music to some degree but may increase mass appeal. In general, SM Entertainment seems to retain a lot of those classic Kpop vibes in the sound of the music, the wardrobes, etc while newer labels may lean towards adapting to Western tastes more. ",
