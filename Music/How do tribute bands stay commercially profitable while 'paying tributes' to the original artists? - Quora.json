            "answer_text": "The legal obligation is to pay Performing Rights fees - which vary according to the laws in the country where the venue is located. Often, the venue pays the rights fee out of their own fee, and the band simply supplies a set list to identify the songs that were performed so that writers get their correct royalties. It\u2019s no different to performing a theatre play - there\u2019s a rights fee for that as well. The PR fee is usually small in comparison to all the other expenses of putting on a show, but does vary according to size and location of venue. It doesn\u2019t make it hard to make money. What does make it hard is venue fees, agency fees, promoter percentages, travel expenses, sound and lighting hire fees, and the difficulty of getting bums on seats. Surprisingly, Tributes usually get better ticket sales than original bands. I\u2019ve been one of 150 people in a 600 seater theatre for a major name artist, and then played with a Floyd tribute to a sellout full house of 600 the following day in the same theatre. It\u2019s just wrong. A bit of info regarding Australian Pink Floyd (APF) and Brit Floyd. Both were formed and remain based in the UK. The original members of Brit Floyd were the English members of APF with a couple of new players added. They were split off by the promotion/management of APF to form Brit Floyd, leaving the Australian team with just half a band and no promoter or funding. The remaining members of APF gathered new members, found new funding, and went back on the road as \u201cThe Australian Pink Floyd Show\u201d in competition with the new band Brit Floyd. There\u2019s a lot more to this story, but essentially BOTH are UK bands, and they don\u2019t get on although I know members of both and they\u2019re nice people. For myself, I worked for five years with Think Floyd, replacing the keyboardist who left to join another tribute, and then moved into Brit Floyd. Small world, music. ",

            "answer_text": "I play in a Pink Floyd tribute band based out of the US. We get crowds of around 1000 people each show, so we are fairly successful. The legality of our playing falls on the venue, so we don't have to worry about that. None of us make a living off of doing this, as there are a dozen of us (aside from musicians, there is a lighting engineer, sound engineer, and video engineer). I probably make $200\u2013400 per show as the keyboardist. And we play around 8\u201310 shows per year. It's a pretty big production, and we don't have any hired help for setting up or tearing down equipment, etc. So it can be exhausting! It's unfortunate because we have to turn down major gigs in other parts of the country, since we can't tour and get other gigs on the way or from. If we all quit our jobs and did it full time, we would make more money. But since we all are pretty successful in what we currently do full time for our jobs, not many of us desire to do it full time. I myself am currently happy in what I do full time, and I have no desire to be a musician for my full time job. ",
