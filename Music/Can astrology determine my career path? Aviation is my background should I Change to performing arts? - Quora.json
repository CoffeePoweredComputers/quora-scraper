            "answer_text": "Astrology, at least in the West, cannot \u2018determine\u2019 your career path. However, it can \u2018advise\u2019 you. Ultimately it is your choice which career you choose. In your case, you do have a creative side. But also a conservative side. Let me elaborate on those points. Creative side - you have Moon and Mars conjunct in the 5th house. The 5th house is the house of creativity. And they are both in Gemini, which is a sign associated with communication, speaking, thinking. And Mars is the planet that rules, or governs, your 10th house. The 10th house is a house associated with career. But it is also about one\u2019s purpose, and overall expression. And you have Pluto in that house as well, providing a level of intensity and focus around career matters. And this Pluto is opposite your Sun in Taurus, in the 4th house. Conservative side - this is perhaps indicative of your aviation career. Your Capricorn ascendant, ruled by Saturn, indicates someone who appears to others as conservative, perhaps \u2018formal\u2019 in some ways. And also there is Saturn (ruler of your Ascendant) in opposition aspect to your Moon-Mars, particularly around emotions (Moon) and actions (Mars). This gives you a sense of responsibility. And it is this side of you which is perhaps more suited to aviation. Summary - So I can see how you have creative interests (Moon-Mars in 6th), and that these may seem quite different to the conservative industry you work in (aviation). I would suggest if you want to be involved in performing arts, to start it as a hobby or part-time interest, and see if it grows. Or you might want to investigate doing radio plays, or radio drama - this is the Gemini influence, the \u2018spoken word.\u2019 So I don\u2019t think it is either aviation or performing arts. I suggest you take small steps towards working in performing arts - start with that. But you do have some noticeable conservative and structured side to your nature, and this may be well-suited to the aviation industry, particulary in administration and management. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to realise that the reason we incarnate on Earth is for our Spiritual Development.On that basis either, both, or neither Career activity has any bearing unless that is taken into account. In dilemmas such as you state, it is a good idea to DO BOTH for a time. That way you will get practical experience and factual knowledge of how you will fit in. So you could do your performances as an unpaid hobby to see how you fit in. Performing Arts places a higher focus on other people\u2019s opinions of you than most other occupations. A fickle public. We see here a classic example of someone who is still living to their Moon Sign, rather than Sun Sign. The Sun Sign Lessons are based on our learning to handle different FORMS OF ENERGY. Earth (Practical), Water (Emotional), Air (Mental), Fire (Spirit. Power). However, it is usually necessary to balance that with the requirements of the other planets. So, with Sun in Taurus, the basis of your Life Lessons is concerned with care of your physical body, and attention to what it takes to do that - which includes earning money, and home security. With Sun in 4th. House there is additional focus on separating from your parental home to make a home of your own. I wonder how close you are to achieving that yet. There is more detail below. We also have to take Saturn into account. This planet defines our true PRACTICAL life path, and is associated with our Career. MOON - THE PAST A factor to be taken into account is that we tend to live according to our MOON SIGN in early life. This determines what kind of home we are born into, and the attitudes of our parents. Until we are free of their control by being self supporting and in our own home our Sun Sign does not begin to have much effect. With Moon in Gemini, Education and Communication would have been important early on. I suspect that your parents, mother especially, would have preferred you to be something like a Teacher, and would have resisted your desire to travel. It is still quite quite likely that you will teach later on - even unpaid - because it will bring you great pleasure. SATURN - THE LIFE PATH We see that your Saturn is in Sagittarius, in Opposition Aspect to your Moon and Mars in Gemini. Saturn in Sagittarius brings the need to broaden the mind through travel or academic study. Your choice of Aviation is interesting because it combines the \"Air\" Sign Gemini with the mind broadening experiences of Sagittarius. Both Signs, being \"Mutable\" Signs, which desire continual Change, are somewhat against your Taurus Sun Lesson which will prefer you to settle down somewhere. We see this in your attitude to the current dilemma between 2 entirely different pursuits - related to your Moon, rather than your Sun. We also see that, although you are gaining experience of life away from home, it will be largely superficial. Saturn in Sagittarius will draw you towards exploring the deeper realities of life, and the Spiritual and Natural Laws of our existence. The fact that you have asked the question here could be a symptom of that. The true answers lie WITHIN YOURSELF. PLUTO I mention Pluto here because it is in your 10th. House of Career, and in exact opposition to your Sun in 4th. House. This means that there will be a focus on the traditional dilemma of \"Home versus Career\". Whatever career you choose you will find sudden unexpected changes beyond your control. Life nowadays consists of constant Change, and there is no such thing as \"a job for life\". So there will be an ever present threat of company take-overs, and/or redundancy. So Sun in Taurus suggests it helpful to have some money in the bank to tide you over such times. Perhaps a lesson from your father? You may be forced to move home in the face of these changes - perhaps even to foreign countries. A way of making us learn lessons is to disturb thing so that we are forced to focus on them. The suggestion is that if you do focus here, there will be less disturbance. ====================================================== YOUR FUTURE : SUN IN TAURUS The main principle of Taurus is concerned with learning how Earth supports growth. If we are spiritual beings, why do we need an earthy existence? You were born at the beginning of Spring when the Earth is beginning to warm up after Winter. Until this happens the young seeds will be unable to put down roots and grow. You are therefore \u201cslow to warm\u201d, but your stability will eventually give the foundations for future growth. The Taurus lesson is basically that of learning to control practical, material, affairs. Taurus is the Fixed Earth Sign, and gives a slow, steady, release of energy. Taureans are forced to be patient. \"The Business Manager and Farmer\". They need to ensure that they are helping make progress rather than just being stubborn and obstructive from fear of change. \"Change is Stability. Stability, Change\". That which stops growing dies. Taurus is also in tune with the cycles of Nature. The lessons are concerned with care and support of a physical body and its need for a steady routine. This can also be referred to other \"physical bodies\" such as individual work, or businesses that depend on routines, and cycles of work. Taurus brings great practical abilities. There is also need to learn how to handle practical resources, such as in organising ones home, or using money. Taurus likes physical comfort, and, although some Astrologers say that Taureans like money, I believe that it is mainly because they like their comforts - and Quality rather than Quantity. The guide to how well progress is being made will be how well one is self supporting, and one's state of health. Taureans have a great deal of physical strength and it takes a lot to upset them. The lesson of Taurus is related to the story of the race between The Tortoise and The Hare. The Tortoise won because the Hare gave up before the finish. ",

But if you're seriously thinking about a life direction based solely on a reading... Don't. Your astrologer isn't going to pay your bills or send you back in time if you make a mistake. If you're bright enough to pursue aviation and understand 'career' vs 'job' you should only follow the advice of the astrologer who gives you winning lottery number. Try something small and challenging first before risking a lot. ",
