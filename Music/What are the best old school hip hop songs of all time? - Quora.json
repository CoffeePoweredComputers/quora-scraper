            "answer_text": "Some of my favorite old school (80s-90s) rap songs include: (in no particular order) Any of Nas\u2019 \u201cIllmatic\u201d songs - The greatest hip hop album of all time. With historic beats & intricate lyrics it was truly the best album.The Militia & Work by Gang Starr - Personally my favorite hip hop duo ever. With the combination of Guru\u2019s rap skills & DJ Premier\u2019s beats they produced a ton of hits including these two songs. Two of my fav\u2019s.Who Shot Ya by Notorious B.I.G. - One of the hardest songs I\u2019ve ever heard gives me chills every time I hear it. RIP to a legend Biggie Smalls.Against All Odds & Changes by Tupac - Another deceased rap legend. These are my two favorite Tupac songs. Changes is one of the most historic rap songs EVER. It\u2019s smooth lyrics really show why Tupac is the best to ever grace the stage. Against All Odds is my favorite diss song ever as well. It goes super hard & is just a great song to rap along to.Don\u2019t Sweat The Technique by Eric B. & Rakim, The Saga Begins - Rakim, When I B on tha mic - Rakim - Now for my last group of songs are by the hip hop legend Rakim. Personally my favorite emcee of all time he truly shaped & brought in a new era of rappers. All of these songs left a lasting impression of the rap world & are just a few more of my favorites. Oh & The Saga Begins has one of the best beats ever.",
