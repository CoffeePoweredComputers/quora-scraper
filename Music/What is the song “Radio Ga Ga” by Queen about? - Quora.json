            "answer_text": "It\u2019s about banality. The song is saying that the music business has become less about sounds and music and more about image and immediacy. Taylor is comparing instantly forgettable music and lyrics to the gurgling of a baby. He is stating that in his opinion radio had a greater meaning and merit for him as a child in the 50s and 60s than it does at the time if writing (mid 80s). He is suggesting that new music isn\u2019t as important to young people as his music was to him. From watching the state of the music business over the 34 years or so since the song\u2019s release I\u2019d say he had a point. ",

            "answer_text": "The title of the song \u201cRadio Ga Ga\u201d actually originates from Roger Taylor\u2019s infant son, Felix. Felix called the songs on the radio \u201cca-ca\u201d (slang for poo). Roger agreed with him as, at that time, the radio stations tended to play the Top Twenty hits all day long. Roger wrote the song, but altered the title to \u201cRadio Ga Ga\u201d. The video which accompanied it was yet another triumph by David Mallet and used the amazing film \u201cMetropolis\u201d for it.
