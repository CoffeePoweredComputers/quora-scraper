            "answer_text": "The people who doesn\u2019t get the Indian music industry makes the industry worst. In some of the record labels, If you\u2019re willing to purchase a license For a particular song, they will respond to your mail. A license is something, which holds the permission to use the particular song, in your video/or any of your works, without any hesitation Music Publishing doesn\u2019t even work in India, music publishing is something to deal with the lyrics and melody not the sound recording but no body cares about it at all. Instance 1: The people. I run a record label ( Abstract Medias ) , most of the artists submit Original songs, but some artists submit remix & cover of another song, people upload covers/remix of another song, not kidding the covers/remix they submit is really awesome. The covers/remix doesn\u2019t contains any original sound recording since and guess what they still get claimed, why? Because it contains the lyrics/melody or both. I legitimately say my people that \u201cyou can\u2019t just cover or remix a song without a license\u201d, after a while realizing that the license cost is higher, they say \u201cdude the license is too high in price, I won\u2019t spend on this crap\u201d I usually reply; \u201cbut dude you\u2019re remix/cover is awesome why won\u2019t you just spend your money on license, and release the song?\u201c and they never release that awesome mix ever again. Instance 2: The record label.Some of the record labels doesn\u2019t even have a option to purchase a license or educate the people that they can use their music in their works without getting a copyright infringement. Popular labels like Universal Music Group (UMG) have a separate page about who can License the music and why you need music license. Instance 3: The people again. have you ever had a friend who downloads every latest songs for free? Well i have one. Some of us don\u2019t even support an artist, if you like someone\u2019s music, you can purchase it or at least stream them in Spotify or JioSaavn (app) to support the artist. so these are the reasons that Indian Music Industry is the worst, like i said before The people who doesn\u2019t get the Indian music industry makes the industry worst.

            "answer_text": " Indian music industry is one of the dumbest music industry. Every music producer is copying songs from different country's music genre. Now a days Tony Kakkar is making bull shit music. He is casting Tiktokers to get their fame so that he can increase his youtube video views. Recently a song called Bala from movie Housefull 4 got viral. 99.9 percent people don't even know that this song is complete copy of original song - Bala by Tony Montana and it was released 3 years ago. Vishal Dadlani recently said that i will sue legal case on those people who are remaking my songs. Bro you just sang a full copied song. Indian idol is also one of the cringiest show i have ever watched on tv. ",
