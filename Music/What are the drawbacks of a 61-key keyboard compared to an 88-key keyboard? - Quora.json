            "answer_text": "It really has to do with your primary intended use. If your main goal is to play piano music; especially solo piano, a 61 key unit simply can\u2019t play all the notes you will encounter in a wide variety of music written for the piano. If you want to take piano lessons, many of the exercises you would do on a piano can\u2019t be done with only 61 keys. Many 61 key keyboards are intended mainly for use as midi controllers. In this context, you are mainly recording tracks with different instrumentation that are then mixed together via digital audio work station (DAW) software such as Ableton Live, Cubase, Apple Garage Band, etc. If your dream goal would be to have a high quality grand piano, but can\u2019t afford it, you can get to some fairly satisfying capabilities with a good 88 weighted and touch sensitive key keyboard. Some of these have weighted key actions that simulate a grand piano action and multi-level touch sensitivity that comes close to the control of expression of a good acoustic piano. If your goal is to experiment with midi sounds, synthesizer capability and mixing tracks, you may find sufficient capability with a 61 key keyboard, but none of these will ever get you close to the experience of playing a good grand piano.

            "answer_text": "Well, it all depends on the genre you play and your own personal preferences. I wouldn\u2019t play classical on a 61-key keyboard because you\u2019ll often need all 88 keys to do it properly. To really get the full feel of a piano even if you don\u2019t have one, the full range is usually a big part of that. If you\u2019re using a 61-key instrument, that would be better suited for the range of say an electric organ or a synth or MIDI controller or what have you. If you\u2019re learning how to play keyboards it wouldn\u2019t be hugely detrimental to keeping basic chops up as a practice tool or an on-the-go thing, but I still think it\u2019s better to learn on an 88-key instrument. That said, learning on an 88-key keyboard would make it easier to acclimate to a 61-key instrument or another keyboard with less range. Plus, oftentimes keyboards with less range have other features that help increase their range beyond the stretch of their limited key number. Electric organs have drawbars that add footages/harmonics, synths have their various bevy of effects, etc. Piano is comparatively much more one-dimensional and as a result depends heavily on it\u2019s full key range to be fully effective- at least in my experience.
