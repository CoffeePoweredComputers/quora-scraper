            "answer_text": "I agree with Shoron, there are so many.First that come to mind:1) Have You Never Been Mellow by Olivia Newton-JohnI have to pause and tell this story: When I was in basic training, many years ago, we looked forward to meal times, because training left us very hungry. Normally the mess hall was filled with soldiers eating and talking. This song had just come out, and while they talked through most of the music, when this song came on, all of the soldiers became quiet and thoughtful, listening and dreaming. We were all truly enchanted. 2) Cat's in the Cradle by Harry ChapinI rarely get through this song without tears. I wasn't close to my father.3) Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon & GarfunkleOne of the most beautiful songs ever written. Art Garfunkle had one of the most amazing singing voices ever. 4) Brother by Uncle JedAn Australian group with a lead singer with one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.5) Suite: Judy Blue Eyes by Crosby, Stills & Nash6) Shadow Captain by CS&N7) Wooden Ships by CS&NThree songs by one of the best groups ever.8) Remember by Greg KihnOne of my very favorite songs.9) The Reach by Dan Fogelberg10) Since You've Asked by Dan Fogelberg11) Lighthouse by James Taylor12) Morning Has Broken by Cat Stevens13) Winter by Tori Amos14) Watershed by Indigo Girls15) Woman of a Thousand Years by Fleetwood MacI could literally come up with hundreds more songs that I will never hate, never grow tired of, and will always treasure.

            "answer_text": "What an interesting thought experiment. Right off the bat, we can discount a few entire classes of music: rap music, hip-hop, country music in general and cowboy music in particular, advertising jingles, pretty much every branch of heavy metal, and the birthday song. Classical music, electronic music, pop music, and gospel are all out too. The reasons for this are because all these genres tend to have people who will hate the entire genre, or at least not give any music in them the time of day. All this said, there are also people unwilling to give music a chance if it's in a different language than their native language. And since English is not everybody's native language, that means no music with words can be used. But wait! There are also people who don\u2019t like instrumental music! Meaning that we can\u2019t choose an instrumental song. I'd also wager fairly heavily that any music popular enough to be in the cultural consciousness (think meme music, TV show theme songs, the Mario theme) will be disliked by somebody. So, basically, what we need is a piece of music with no lyrics but isn\u2019t instrumental, is not popular enough that someone who doesn\u2019t already like it will have heard it, is in English, isn\u2019t hip-hop, country, cowboy music, or advertising anything. So I did what any sane person would do in searching for such a song: after screaming into my pillow, I accepted the inevitability of death. Then I listened to some Tame Impala. Basically, there is no song that everybody would like. Even my rules are insufficient considering it\u2019s from a west-centric point of view regarding music. If you\u2019re looking for a song with the highest chance of the person listening to it, the simpler the better. Try some lo-fi beats, or maybe some real underground bands like LAKE or Camino 84. Suggestions from my friends also included Jinsang, Nujabes, and Disclosure. ",
