            "answer_text": "No, your publisher definitely registers your songs. In fact they really must, so they can track them in their local database as well as register the songs with PROs (Performing Rights Societies) worldwide. You see, each territory has a different PRO. For instance in the UK, the PRO is PRS. In Japan it\u2019s JASRAC. And when your song generates performance income in those territories, it is first collected by the local PRO. So for them to collect on your behalf and know what PRO to funnel the income back to, they must have you listed as a writer on the song in their local database and be able to see what PRO you are signed to. If for instance, you were signed to Universal Music Publishing, and you turned in a new song, the Universal copyright department would register your song with not only the local PRO you are signed to, but they would electronically send the song/writer/publisher information to every PRO worldwide. And, once the information was received, the various PROs would send back an electronic notification that the song had been received and logged into their database. This is just one of the reasons that if you are generating income with your music on a global level, a publishing deal is essential. However, if you are just starting out, don\u2019t be so quick to want to tie yourself to a publisher - such a deal could prove to be a hindrance rather than a help.

            "answer_text": "As a composer you have to join your PRO of choice on your own. Then, the publisher will register your work under their respective Publisher name under your respective PRO. To use Carl Fischer as an example: If you are registered to ASCAP and you sign a piece to Carl Fischer, they will register the piece under the name \u201cCarl Fischer\u201d at ASCAP. If you were a member of BMI, they would instead register under \u201cPembroke Music\u201d, a d/b/a of Carl Fischer for the purposes of copyright and royalties collection through BMI exclusively. Of course, when in doubt, always contact your publisher on specifics. This sort of thing is exactly in their wheelhouse and should be able to answer any questions you have. ",
