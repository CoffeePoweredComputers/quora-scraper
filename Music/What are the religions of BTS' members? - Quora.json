            "answer_text": "I dont think they have a religion, or at least it is not confirmed. But there are some hints though\u2026 V: V\u2019s religion has not been confirmed, but he might be Christian because he had a Christian worship song on his playlist. But some think that V himself, doesn\u2019t know that it is a Christian song. RM: He once stated that he does not have a religion and confirmed that he is an atheist. He has been seen wearing a necklace with a cross on it, and many have been confused by this. Suga: Suga wrote once in a message to his fans that he had no religion as well. He said, \u201cAs a human who is weak but acts strong, I realized once again that I am merely a human being. Although I don\u2019t have a religion, I prayed during that time\u2026\u201d . Jin: He has not confirmed his religion to the public and is known to have no religion like the other members. Jungkook: He has as well not confirmed anything about his religion, but he did attend the School of Performing Arts in Seoul in high school. And according to the schools official website, it says that it is the first school in South Korea which is Christian based high school with special purposes in performing arts. The student even take Bible-teaching class once a week. Jimin: Jimin\u2019s religion is also unknown. J-Hope: Hobi is also known to be non-religious. He once said though that he has faith in the fact that he would become a successful artist and that this faith was the source of his energy. I hope I answered well ",

            "answer_text": "Usually BTS has been known to stay quiet about religion, but here\u2019s what I know from my hours spent on the boys. Jin: Doesn\u2019t talk about religion, but I assume he is not religious. Yoongi: He went to an all boys school, which is most likely Catholic or Christian, according to a source. Namjoon: He has said himself he is atheist, so of course he is not religious. Hoseok: Again, not a lot of the members talk about being religious, so I think not. Jimin: Yet again. See previous answer above. Taehyung: He is probably Christian. He has once mentioned a Christian song (by Hillsong, a Christian band) and has frequently done gestures that many ARMYs say are religious (i.e. he kisses his hand, then points to the sky, as in reference to God). Jungkook: Another unknown religious practicer. I hope this helped a small bit. This is all I\u2019ve found out. ",
