            "answer_text": "Ah - I like William Kerell's answer but I will also tell you why I don't like heavy metal, or even any form of hard rock. I belong to the target demographic, though. Born in the late 60s, I came of 'musical age' when there was hard rock aplenty: AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Def Leppard in the early to mid 80s, and indeed all these bands were massively popular at all the schools I went to. Kiss, Van Halen, ZZ Top, Metallica, Saxon and other guitar bands were also there. Later, Guns n Roses and Aerosmith took the baton and became global superstars too. You could say it was a bit of a golden age for metal. So why did people like me not get into it? Reason 1: it became almost too mainstream. I know that William said it's not music for the 'in' crowd, but in a way, it was. It was the thing to be into if you were a 13-year old male growing up at that time in the 80s. Other music was for pussies. Reason 2: even if you don\u2019t think it was mainstream, there were different ways to get out of the mainstream. Electronic music was starting up, and for me that was the best way to not conform. Not macho? Check. Slightly androgynous? Check. Lots of bands and subgenres that were quite obscure and therefore cool? Check. Heavy metal didn't really have that, well not for us anyway. Reason 3: now let's go into the music itself. As many have said, people will initially get into music that's cool, based on environmental perceptions and preconceptions, but ultimately will gravitate towards what they really like, what they feel connected to, at a primitive level. And heavy metal just doesn't do it for a lot of people. It doesn't do it for me. I dislike the loudness of the guitars, I dislike the growling or shouting voices, I dislike the lyrics (usually), I don't even like the tempo (usually too slow for me except Ace of Spades or Paranoid), and I don't like guitar solos. Nothing to do with the long hair or mosh pits, I wouldn't mind that, it's just the actual music that does nothing for me. I feel the same about grunge, never been into Nirvana, Pearl Jam or any of that. And there are many other music types that I like and can spend a lot of time and money in, so it's not that I am not musically inclined or that I am missing out on a whole art form. And that\u2019s the thing: there is so much music out there, you\u2019re bound to find a genre, or many, that really grab you. And that's it. I have lots of heavy metal-loving friends, I have even been to gigs with them (my first was AC/DC in 1986, in Germany, quite an event for a 17 year-old) but I have never connected with the music itself. Not saying it's bad, I appreciate that it has many talented songwriters, performers and is musically interesting, just not for me. If you are so much into it and you are so passionate about it that you cannot understand why there are people on this Earth who just don't get it, well, be sure that I used to be a young listener and advocate of early 80s synthpop and I too could not understand why everyone was not into it! I got older and have accepted that there are many genres and each of them has their advocates, and it's a better world because of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Heavy Metal music has many subgenres. I\u2019d say some really heavy bands did get pretty popular (not only traditional metal like Maiden, Sabbath and Judas Priest, but also Thrash and Groove Metal acts like the Big Four, Sepultura and Pantera) and things like Nu-Metal did become very cool and \u201chip\u201d (although that has to do with it\u2019s hip-hop influences and a generally different approach, sometimes closer to that of pop music, to songwriting than \u201ctrue metal\u201d). Precisely, many Nu groups had a sound more reminiscent of Alt Rock. They toned down or almost took away the HEAVINESS. It seems like people are willing to hear some overdrive and distortion, but if you go overboard, especially with things like noise, where the melody may be more hard to follow, then they are likely to lose interest (not saying that Sonic Youth wasn\u2019t popular, for example, but you get the point). Plus, it still (despite the fact that it\u2019s reputation has improved) is somewhat infamous for \u201cmaking people violent\u201d and \u201cbeing satanic\u201d. This was due to the cultural shift that ocurred in the late 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s where controversy regarding what TV shows, Music and Video Games could get away with, grew. Culminating in things like the Parental Advisory Label and the ESRB. Heavy Metal, along with Hip-Hop, presented very shocking imagery. Going back to Maiden, they talked openly about satanic rituals and the Devil. You\u2019ve even got a whole genre dedicated to this topic (Black Metal). Or if you want to talk about violence in general, Slayer\u2019s best known song \u201cAngel of Death\u201d openly talks about Joseph Mengele. Otherwise, I believe it\u2019s still a far more accesible genre than a lot of Prog Rock, for example. I don\u2019t think the average person would be interested in anything beyond Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes and perhaps Focus. At least I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t be willing to sit for extra long tracks as featured on Can\u2019s \u201cTago Mago\u201d or Soft Machine\u2019s \u201cThird\u201d (4 20 minute long tracks, people). Those are my 2 cents on the issue, anyway. ",
