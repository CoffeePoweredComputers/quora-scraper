            "answer_text": "Short Answer, Prog Rock: Long, melodic, complex, clean, warm Psych Rock: Short, loud, distorted, unclean and lots of drugs. Long Answer, Well, now get to the longer part. Both psych rock and prog rock progressed side by side. While psych rock came little bit before than prog rock. Psych rock was heavily influenced by loud rock n\u2019 roll and garage rock with mix of folk tunes. It came during 1965. The first psych rock band was bands like 13th Floor Elevator, Jimi Hendrix Experience, Jefferson Airplane, Byrds etc. Beatles played a significant role in this case. While on the other hand, folk artists like Bob Dylan also made a huge influence on psych rock. Jimi Hendrix in the late \u201960s was the most iconic psych rock artist. Especially with his guitar experiments. Messing up with various pedals and effects. Many psychedelic rock guitarists played riffs with power chords, used different pedals and effects. Wah wah pedal was a popular one. They got loud on their guitar. Well, psychedelic rock wasn\u2019t bound to only in music but also it became a culture. It is known as the hippie culture during the late \u201860s.  Especially if you look at the woodstock in 1969. There were three big genres - folk, psych and blues. These three genres collaborated with each other and led what I mentioned hippie. They used to wear long bellbottom jeans, tight shirts, long afro style haircut. They also did heavy drugs. I mean not everyone did drugs but it was more associated with musicians. Ritchie Blackmore once said that he never smoked cause he thought everyone was doing it and thought it was cool. There is also an interview of Jon Lord who is saying there was some kind of famous acid among rockstars. Anyway, like this psychedelic rock wasn\u2019t only a genre but also a cultural revolution. Now,  to prog rock. Prog rock was more focused on classical music from the beginning. Like I already mentioned in one of my posts, many artists such as Beatles helped creating both prog and psych rock. But prog rock was somewhat more classical oriented, which means it focused on more complex music structures. And it didn\u2019t only rely on guitar but also on other instruments as well as keyboards. Prog rock provided melodic, clean vocals. Prog rock was chilling. Prog rock also had slower, longer guitar solos. Prog rock developed in the late \u201960s and continued its marching in the mid \u201870s. It took some time to develop. King Crimson had the first prog rock album. Prog rock also didn\u2019t become a cultural thing like psych rock. In the \u201970s punk rock became a cultural movement. While prog rock remained as a music genre only. And it wasn\u2019t also highly associated with drugs. Many musicians such as Robert Fripp probably never did drugs. Rush members also don\u2019t seem like doing drugs. But doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t do drugs. Pink Floyd did hell lot of drugs. Anyway, at the end of the day what I could say drug became a part of psych rock but not prog rock. It had nothing to do with drugs. Many prog rock songs are long. Significantly longer than psych rock. Like 20 minutes or even longer. Their music was clean. And provided soft melody. Now what\u2019s the lyrical difference? Psych rock varied. It contained stuffs from older blues. Like losing home, lost love, betrayer, sex, money, drugs and lots of others things Or it borrowed some other stuffs from folk rock as well. Nevertheless psych rock had two themes -sex and drugs. It was almost inevitable for rock bands. While on the other hand prog rock was story-driven. It also had many philosophical or historical themes in them. Many bands such as Rush used both poetic verses and sometimes few scientific inventions. Prog rock had strong connection with literature with relates to fantasy, magic or stuffs like that etc etc. It has richer words and better lyrics. But that\u2019s subjective. ",

            "answer_text": "The lines are fuzzy (pun intended). You can hear early progressive music in Procol Harum, the Mothers of Invention (especially Absolutely Free), the Nice, Family, United States of America, Soft Machine, even Cream, Hendrix and early Pink Floyd and the Doors. Progressive rock was classically influenced, but that wasn't every prog rock group's point of departure. For some Progressive Rock (King Crimson, ELP, Colosseum, the Mothers, the Nice, Cream, Hendrix even Yes) jazz was a profound influence. The main difference between the two idioms was the level of instrumental prowess and conscious structure. For instance, nobody in the 13th Floor Elevators had the instrumental chops to play what became known as prog. (Some group members like the keyboard player in the Stawberry Alarm Clock, did.) So psychedelic was basically a put everything into a blender, see what comes out. Prog was more\u2026.here's a recognizable style (classical jazz) nect to another recognized style. So the presentation of prog was cleaner, more rehearsed. Jon Anderson of Yes, in hearing King Crimson, said \u201cWe have to practice more\". Some groups considered Prog actually retained some free flowing unstructured pieces, King Crimson and Henry Cow most famously, but this was unusual. ELP or Jethro Tull did as well as the more jazz oriented groups. But I can recall both trends and the bands with better chops usually converted to Progressive. Lots of the psych bands became boogie or blues based bands if they stayed around. ",
