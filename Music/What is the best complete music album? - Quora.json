            "answer_text": "Daylight Again, by Crosby, Stills, and Nash The Book of Secrets, by Loreena McKennitt Watermark, by Enya The Celts, by Enya O Come All Ye Faithful, by Kings College Choir (of Cambridge, UK), conducted by Stephen Cleobury, with David Willcocks on pipe organ (on the Argo label in the US, or possibly on Decca or London in the UK) Faure and Durufle Requiems, performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, conducted by Robert Shaw (on Telarc) John Rutter Requiem (and a few other songs), performed by the Turtle Creek Chorale and the Dallas Women\u2019s Choir, conducted by Timothy Seelig (on Reference Recordings) Organ Fireworks, performed by Christopher Herrick on the great organ at Westminster Abbey (on Hyperion) Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring, performed by the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Lorin Maazel (on Telarc) Mussorgsky\u2019s Pictures at an Exhibition, performed by the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Lorin Maazel (on Telarc) Mahler\u2019s Symphony #1 (\u201cTitan\u201d), performed by the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta (on CBS Masterworks) Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Scheherezade, performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Fritz Reiner (on RCA Victor) Joseph Jongen\u2019s Symphonie Concertante, performed by the San Francisco Symphony, conducted by Edo de Waart, with Michael Murray on the Ruffatti pipe organ in Davies Symphony Hall (inaugural recording of this organ, on Telarc) (and numerous other complete CD albums which are basically a single symphony performance by one of the great orchestras of the world, conducted by one of the great conductors of the world) And finally \u2014 on my wish list \u2014 this CD album doesn\u2019t exist yet, but I really wish that this performance could be released on CD: Aaron Copland\u2019s Third Symphony, performed by the San Francisco Symphony, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas (in the summer of year 2000, and also in the spring of year 2003). This is the most amazing interpretation and performance that I\u2019ve ever heard for this symphony. No other performance, even that of Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic, even comes close to the \u201cmagic\u201d that MTT/SFS put into their performance. Why, oh why, do they keep sitting on this recording (in the private archives of the San Francisco Symphony)? If only they could release it on CD \u2014 this is a performance that, in my opinion, deserves a Grammy Award. Seriously! ",
