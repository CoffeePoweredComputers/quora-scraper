            "answer_text": "Consider first that Paul is a bit of an egocentric bloke. Maybe he earned that being one half one of the most lauded songwriting teams in music history. Being one of the Beatles (and the cute one/a lead singer) impacts one\u2019s self-esteem significantly. I\u2019m sure each wanted a nod for the band\u2019s success; when Ringo\u2019s drumming was attacked, he became bruised and livid. Paul and John were tied by the umbilical of their writing credits arrangement. At the onset, they both agreed everything the Beatles turned out was to be a Lennon/McCartney credit (it was John\u2019s band originally). And they wrote little as a team. Impressive research shows the two \u201cshared\u201d writing credits evenly on only 17 songs, most Beatles songs were written solely by one or the other. Lennon wrote 61 songs credited to ''Lennon-McCartney'' entirely by himself, and McCartney composed 43 on his own. Who would John have been had he lived? What sort of person/writer/performer, if he were around today? Well that\u2019s just it. Paul is the remains of Lennon/McCartney. Paul desperately wanted his song \u201cYesterday\u201d (no input from John at all) to be re-released as simply Paul McCartney. Yoko would have none of that. Lots of feelings. Just recently new video of the Beatles was discovered and included all the footage of the \u201cLet It Be\u201d sessions. In one bit, Paul is heard to say he never liked much of George\u2019s writing (until \u201cSavoy Truffle\u201d, etc.). George is heard saying, \u2018everyone else seems to have liked my songs right down the line.\u2019 I\u2019ve no idea how Paul feels about having said that, or history regurgitating his words on video tape. It\u2019s just that sort of thing I believe Paul would have liked to \u201cchange\u201d, remove from public domain, if he could, wouldn\u2019t you? There is a YouTube video (worth the watch) of Paul explaining a song for Live Aid to Eric Clapton. Paul is suggesting chord structures to Eric, saying, \u2018You won\u2019t have a problem with that.\u2019 The camera zooms in on Eric's face and he seems shocked at the guitar lesson. McCartney is known to currently say things like \"I'm still very competitive\", another is \"Do you know anyone who doesn't have insecurities?\" A dominant but wrongheaded myth of the modern celebrity era is that great fame and success fundamentally changes people. There are ways it can, of course, but what is far more notable is that we are who we are, and that\u2014no matter how much fame and acclaim and money and experience are added to the equation\u2014we tend to change very little, both for better and for worse. At the other side of it all, more often than not, we discover ourselves to be who we already were, just a bit more of it.  (video here.) ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what your talking about. But on the face of it, the question itself lacks any understanding of common human habits. And I just don\u2019t see why you\u2019d realistically even have a problem with that. He\u2019s one of two actual surviving Beatles, and Ringo didn\u2019t write a whole lot. Paul McCartney, with every public appearance, is faced with (to him, pointless) questions about a band he was in 50 years ago. He does his best to honestly answer how he recollects events and odd questions. You know, he HAS actually spent most of his life \u2018NOT being in The Beatles\u2019. Still, he obviously remembers it fondly and does his best to answer questions he\u2019s not quite sure why anyone would ask\u2026from his point of view, at least. As a person who has, for better and worse, spent his entire adult life in the public eye, McCartney is incredibly grateful, gracious, and pretty good-natured about what must seem to be very insipid queries into events that mattered very little within the creative process. Why can\u2019t you ask more constructive questions? Like, maybe about their methodology, process and inspiration? They were the goddamn Beatles writing hit songs. That was a lot of pressure. Don\u2019t be an ass and accuse him trying to change Beatles history as if he would possibly give a fuck. That dude is Sir Paul McCartney! Member of The Beatles, Wings, and several successful solo albums; who, incidentally, still tours! ",
