            "answer_text": "Simple answer: They can't reproduce what they did in the studio and feel it's necessary to have that part/these parts during the show. Before anyone layers their own meaning onto this, \"can't reproduce\" to me is not a pejorative statement.  Queen would use a recording of the middle operatic part of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" during shows (check out 1979's \"Live Killers\").  Because how on earth would you do something live that took dozens of overdubs from only three people (Freddie, Brian May and Roger Taylor) and weeks to record?  So it's not necessarily bad.  And if you saw then-Queen live and it went straight from \"sometimes I wish I'd / never been born at all\" to \"so you think you can stone me and spit in my eye,\" fans would feel there was something lacking.  The Who would use taped recordings of keyboards for it's \"Who's Next\" catalog as well which sometimes had glitches (see the documentary on the making of \"Who's Next\") but they felt were necessary. In general, your options as a live band are to decide how important the part is to the song, and then decide how you're going to do it.  If it's a very iconic part like the opera in \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" or the keyboards in \"Won't Get Fooled Again,\" then usually it's served up to make the song stick together.  Then your options are 1) find extra musicians to play/sing it, or 2) play a recording (more like \"trigger the file\" today). Genre is a big decider here.  If it's a very pop setting, it's more likely, as the exact sound and tone of the well-known song are important.  Lady Gaga sitting on stage doing piano-only versions of her songs probably would be intriguing for fans for the first little bit, but after that she'd probably disappoint people.  For rock and roll, there are many session musicians and the like who get hired for tours to fill out the sound (Chuck Leavell and Bobby Keys still tour with the Rolling Stones but only are highlighted in a few songs, for example).   The crux of your question however may be \"what if they could play the part but they aren't good enough / don't trust themselves enough?\", and in that case the reason is the same but the feeling by fans may be different.  Staring in the 1990s, you had more singers/performers using backing tracks to ensure sonic quality -- if you were Madonna or Janet Jackson or whomever running around onstage all night with full-on dance routines, you may not have wanted to sound like a panting dog when the chorus came around.  In these instances, the sound crew would usually have a prerecorded vocal they would keep running along with the song, and when the singer sounded winded, they'd cross fade that in so the audience didn't suffer.  That trend has continued as far as I know with some of today's singers/performers. Finally, the simple answer may be: \"You're playing at the Super Bowl.\"  Red Hot Chili Peppers admit to not instruments plugged in during Super Bowl halftime show  ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, pop bands do this. But it was weird to see the trend of backing tracks pop up in metal...sure, you need that 808drop in your metalcore breakdown...However, i started to see acts perform with drums, vocals, rhythm guitar, bass onstage...but having blazing lead guitar played back through the PA. The reasons are sad, but uniform:\"X member quit\"\"X member doesn't/can't tour\"\"kids don't know the difference\"\"why pay for 'extra'members\" The reasons are shitty, because bands are made of people...and some of them suck. Oftentimes, not always, but it is becoming more common...those studio tracks are kept because the engineer or producer created them, and the artist has no way of recreating them live, w/o hiring more personnel. And the justification is always \"well, they did it first\". So, yeah...metal is taking cues from ariana grande and justin bieber...and the world just turns... ",
