            "answer_text": "I hope this doesn\u2019t offend you, but for your age, joining a band would be too early, puberty will hit and you guys will mostly break up due to hormonal emotions. My advice is, practice, practice, practice. Go to band gigs, learn from people who have experienced being in a band. Pick an idol, train so hard that your idol becomes your rival. Have fun and good luck! ",
