            "answer_text": "When I was thirteen, my best friend started listening to K-pop. She quickly roped my little sister into it, too, and soon everywhere I went it seemed that all I heard was GOT7 or BTS or EXO. At first, I was incredibly frustrated. Why did they listen to that music if they couldn\u2019t understand it? Was it just for the cute boys? It just didn\u2019t make sense, so, naturally, I had to find out for myself. It started with BTS: I watched a couple of music videos and decided that, yeah, they were fine. It was nothing mindblowing for me, but there were a couple of good songs and the boys were sweet and funny. I had a couple of new songs to add to my playlist, and while I hadn\u2019t really become a fan of K-pop, I understood why my friends were. The music was by no means bad \u2013 just not really aligned with my taste \u2013 and the visuals were great. Made sense. I figured I\u2019d end my investigation there, but no. I was bored one day and found myself looking up GOT7; they had different music than BTS did, but it still wasn\u2019t my type of music, so it had very little, if any, effect on how I saw K-pop. The same went with other groups I looked into, including EXO and ASTRO. And then I found Day6. Granted, they\u2019re not so much as K-pop as they are K-rock, and they\u2019re more of a band than an idol group, but I immediately thought their music was terrific. From there I found other groups, both bands and idol groups alike, that suited my music taste: N.flying, KNK, SF9, The Rose. They were great, and I was definitely a fan of K-pop by the time I\u2019d found all those groups I enjoyed. When I tried going back to regular pop, I found it taken over by all these new artists whose music I just didn\u2019t enjoy, like XXXTentacion and Cardi B. Music was changing while I was still stuck back in 2015 pop, and the K-pop I\u2019d found fit my tastes much better. Recently I\u2019ve strayed from K-pop and run into some K-indie and K-R&B, but I think that covers my reasoning on why I like K-pop. I can\u2019t speak for the rest of the teenage population, but I personally like K-pop because the music fits my taste where regular pop doesn\u2019t, and while I don\u2019t understand the language, neither does everybody who listens to Despacito but doesn\u2019t speak Spanish. It\u2019s a catchy song, even if you don\u2019t know what it means. Likewise, K-pop is full of catchy music, even if you can\u2019t understand it. These days, I just listen to whatever sounds good, regardless of its country of origin. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s multiple factors that go into teenagers being attracted to kpop. Of course, not every teenager likes kpop, but here are some of the most common reasons why! Kpop is highly visual. This factor is actually just as important as the music if not more important. Kpop videos generally don\u2019t give an artist a track and that\u2019s it. When artists release a new single or album (called a comeback in the kpop world) , there\u2019s always a \u201cconcept\u201d or style that the artist follows. Music videos are always released in HD and, increasingly, 4K quality in order to further enhance the visual experience for viewers. Thousands of dollars are spent on set pieces and camera lighting to set the stage and countless hours are spent editing as the team meticulously inserts group shots, plays with the best angles, etc. As for the artists, many kpop stars are selected to be in groups in part based off of the marketability of their face and their potential to fit multiple looks. Makeup, clothing and hair are the three tools that creates the cohesive look that artists sport for their promotion period. Korean skincare and makeup are the top weapons used for kpop stars to keep their faces looking gorgeous and slaying all who see them. Colored contacts are often used in conjunction with dyed hair colors of brown, blue, blond, etc. Each time an idol group has a comeback, different wardrobes are worn every single time. Even their everyday outfits are simplistic and chic, similar to what models would wear. In fact, there are often members in idol groups who hold the title of \u201cvisual\u201d , meaning the one that is often heralded as the most good looking. Teens like myself gobble this stuff up because it looks stunning, and sometimes, otherworldly. Don\u2019t believe me? Here\u2019s an example of brilliant visual content by kpop artists. Kpop is very catchy. Lots of work goes into kpop songs/albums. they\u2019re often produced by a mix of Korean, American and Swedish producers, which makes the kpop sound a bit reminiscent of the three put together to an extent. Kpop has plenty of different genres covered, so there\u2019s something for everybody. EDM, rock, pop, and ballads are only a few of the genres seen in Korean pop music. Often times the artists themselves will produce their own songs, which kpop fans really love and appreciate. One staple of kpop is English lyrics. This helps with the catchiness of the song because there\u2019s normally a phrase (commonly from which the song\u2019s title is derived) in Korean or in English that is always sung. An example of this is the promotional song used for Mnet\u2019s survival show Produce 101: \u201cPick Me\u201d (link below). In addition, great care is given to make sure vocalists can sing main verses and punctuating lines in the chorus. Song composition often goes : verse 1 , buildup (often shortest part), chorus (including catchy Korean or English phrase/word) verse 2, buildup, chorus, bridge (often where the raps and or high notes come in), chorus! And it works every single time! Kpop is performance- intensive. People love to look at a show, and teens are no exception. Kpop stars are trained to know how to look at the cameras, make the proper facial expressions, and most of all, how to dance. While not every single kpop group has difficult dance routines, a certain dance is always made for title tracks unless it\u2019s simply a ballad that vocalists usually sing. On the more intense end of the spectrum, these routines are highly choreographed with every member needing to be precise, clean and able to keep up with the energetic performances that kpop demands. When it\u2019s practiced to perfection, the result looks flawless. Even members who aren\u2019t dancers look amazing! As for other groups who don\u2019t do such intricate choreography, it\u2019s common to have a \u201cpoint dance\u201d , which is a dance that has a signature move. This sort of dance is meant to be relaxed and makes it easier for fans t dance along to their favorite songs. Just google \u201cAdore U\u201d by Seventeen and start dancing, you\u2019ll see what I mean!!Kpop stars are relatable. Kpop stars tend to be pretty relatable to their fans because, well, they\u2019re just like us. The only differences are the packed schedules, fame, and possibly larger income that they have. However, Korean media helps us to see the more \u201chuman\u2019 side of them with variety shows. Shows such as Weekly Idol, Hello Counselor, and other group broadcasts like NCT Life help viewers see idols while they let their hair down and play games while having heart to heart conversations about how far they\u2019ve come. Not only that, but fan events such as hi-touches and fanmeets allow us to interact with them and experience their humorous sides.Conclusion: I could list more reasons why teenagers like kpop, but these are the main ones. Their music and hard work strikes a chord in our hearts and we enjoy their personalities! Plus, their pretty faces are a plus too, haha! In all seriousness, kpop isn\u2019t just a music genre, it\u2019s part of Korean culture, and it creates a wonderful community for people of all ethnicities, cultures, and languages to take part in. For us, music has no language. The eclectic mix of visuals, sounds, faces, and dances creates such a lasting impression on us to where we often say: \u201c I wanna be like that.\u201d Not necessarily be a kpop star, but to want to work hard like kpop stars and achieve our dreams, and look great while doing it. Kpop makes us look inward and makes us reflect on what we look like, how we wanna be, and most importantly, has an impression on how we feel. To me, that is what music is all about. Making beautiful melodies and harmonies that human beings can relate to and make them feel what you want them to feel. Kpop is successful with doing that each and every time. I hope I answered your question well enough. Sorry about the length. ",
