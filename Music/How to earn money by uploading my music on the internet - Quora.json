            "answer_text": "You can make money with Spotify, but it will only be enough for a small side income. It makes more sense to offer your music on different platforms. But more on that later. To start making money with Spotify, you need to upload your songs. The best way to do this is in the form of a playlist, a collection of different songs. Create playlist on smartphones / tablets: Start Spotify; Click the \u201cLibrary\u201d button; then music / playlist; choose a name for a playlist; add your songs Create a playlist on desktop devices: Start Spotify; select \u201cNew Playlist\u201d from the menu; choose a name for your playlist; if desired, create a cover; add your songs In both cases it is still possible to edit, move or remove your songs later. The menu items are actually self-explanatory and easy to find. How much can I earn with streaming in general? Earning money with Spotify is possible, but quite pointless by itself. At least if you are thinking of larger sums of money. As an artist with good songs, it makes perfect sense to offer them on different platforms. One possibility is e.g. B. Napster. This platform is in high demand and pays almost $ 17 on 1,000 streams. This is what makes them so popular with their users. Apple Music is also at the forefront. For every 1,000 streams, artists are paid almost USD 8 on this platform. Of course, the Internet giant Amazon also offers a platform. At almost USD 7.50 per 1,000 streams, it is way ahead of Spotify. So it makes perfect sense not only to want to earn money with Spotify, but also to offer your songs on other platforms. The more you \u201cspread\u201d your titles, the better known you will be on the net. Earn money with Spotify - step by step instructions If you want to make money with Spotify, you absolutely need a premium account. Although this is chargeable, it also offers unlimited possibilities. The best way to do this if you want to make money with Spotify: 1) Sign up for Spotify Premium. However, this is only possible if you also have a Facebook account. 2) Download the appropriate software. The app is a great way to have quick access to your future account. 3) You then have to create your own Spotify account and then connect it to your Facebook account. There are special buttons in the menu for this. 4) When you have done that, the so-called \u201cSpotify Client\u201d opens, with which the program is later controlled. 5) You don't have to go through the hassle of setting up your account if you want to make money with Spotify. Some of your data (e.g. your profile photo) is taken from Facebook. 6) Create your own playlist. We already described how this works above. If you want more attention in order to be able to earn money with Spotify, a cover with a high recognition value is worthwhile. 7) Share your songs with Easy way to share your files or friends and acquaintances. The connection with your Facebook account may seem a bit strange at first glance - but on closer inspection it makes perfect sense. This is the only way that all your friends have instant access to your playlist. So as long as you also use Spotify Premium. You can also send specific songs to people on your list. The direct reach is simply much greater than with comparable platforms. More tips and hints If you want to make money on Spotify, you have to be the rights holder. If you sell titles by other artists in your name, you are making yourself liable to prosecution! It makes perfect sense if you play your songs to close friends first. If the track then has the potential to become a catchy tune, the costs for Spotify and possibly other platforms are worthwhile. Because these membership fees should be amortized as quickly as possible. The number of your followers will only play a subordinate role later. It is much more important how often your songs are listened to in the required length of around 30 seconds. You can not only share your songs on special streaming platforms, but also on sites like Easy way to share your files . ",
