            "answer_text": "Depends on how you use it. I once saw a guitarist and singer that was doing everythign through a loop pedal. Which made him sound like he was playing 4 guitars. Then he took out a Kazoo and used it to improvise.. Through the mic, it sounded like a cheap saxophone, but an instrument nonetheless. It added musical value to what his was doing, so it can be used as an instrument. it wouldn\u2019t be my first choice, but possible. ",
