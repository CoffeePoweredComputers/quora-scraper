            "answer_text": "While I don\u2019t know and this could be Googled: please allow me to correct your grammar and explain the problem. It doesn\u2019t matter how many Grammys: there\u2019s only one Diana Ross. So the verb relates to Ms. Ross and should be singular. Your question should read as follows: \u201cHow many Grammys has Diana Ross won?\u201d I\u2019m just guessing here that English is not your first language, and that your native tongue may operate differently than English. My intent is not to single you out, to embarrass you, but to try to teach (I suck at teaching, but I want to help soooo! much!) a simple little thing about the complex conglomeration which is my beloved native tongue. NB: The \u2018bible\u2019 of English grammar is a tiny book titled \u2018Elements of Style\u2019 by Strunk and White. It can even be found online for free. : )) ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, now grammar aside, back to the question. Diana Ross was nominated 11 times, includes as a solo artist, also with the Supremes and one duet with Lionel Ritchie. She never won for her 11 nominations. However, in 2012, she awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Grammy Board, for her body of work! Its easy to get this information on google, just put in your question , and like magic you have it! ",
