            "answer_text": "The 7th in the half diminished chord is a dominant 7. In fully diminished 7th chords however, it is lowered another half step, resulting in a double flat on the seventh tone. One can also think of the cords as being a series of thirds stacked together. In the fully diminished chords, the notes are all a minor third apart.  Using the key of C as example: Diminished (triad) = C Eb GbHalf-diminished 7 aka \"minor7-flat-5\"= C Eb Gb BbDiminished 7 = C Eb Gb Bbb (I.e. A natural)",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t differentiate. It\u2019s all the same stacked minor thirds. One is a triad and the other is a 7th chord with 4 notes. You can hear that the voicing is made from 4 parts instead of 3 parts. IMHO (just play full diminished all the time) Triad diminished is for a special sound. ",
