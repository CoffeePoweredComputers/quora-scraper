            "answer_text": "When I think of Horns, the first thing that comes to my mind is a French Horn, or anything with Horn in its name. I don\u2019t think of Saxophones as horns because they are in the woodwind family. And I don\u2019t think of Trumpets and Trombones as horns because they don\u2019t contain the word Horn in their names. When people say horns they usually mean Saxophones, Trumpets, and Trombones. But that tends to confuse me, because as I mentioned, it makes me think of French Horns, Hunting Horns, or any other instrument with horn in their names. I personally prefer just saying \u201cSaxophones and Brass Instruments\u201d because it consists of various brass instruments, along with Saxophones which are made of brass but categorised as woodwind instruments because they have reeds and are built to resemble woodwind instruments apart from the shape of their bells.

            "answer_text": "Because they are conical shaped instruments. And the first such instruments was made of horns. Literal horns. Like the ones in movies and the Bible. Eventually people made them out of metal, made them long to achieve certain pitches, wrapped them around for compactness, and added keys for chromaticity. In the case of the saxophone, instead of an opening, they stuck a reed in there. That makes it still a horn, but also a woodwind instrument. ",
