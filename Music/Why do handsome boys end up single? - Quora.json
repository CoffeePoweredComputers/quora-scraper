            "answer_text": "Multiple reasons - You might be intimidating them, without really meaning to- Very good looking people - like very intelligent or successful folks tend to intimidate most people. Most of us are imperfect people dealing with issues like insecurity. Seeing someone who\u2019s objectively gorgeous ( not just cute) triggers our insecurity. Women or men ( depending on your sexuality) may feel a magnetic pull to you, but at same time will feel a bit insecure and a bit uncertain as to where they stand with you, how you perceive them etc. If you look anything like this -  Or this  Or this  Or this  This  Now I am aware that I don\u2019t speak for all straight women when I say that I find these guys drop dead gorgeous. I know that not all straight women would dig these guys. ( Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder). But fact is - most if not all straight women will find these guys physically attractive, or aesthetically appealing at least. As a straight women who\u2019s not ace, meeting guys as gorgeous as the specimens illustrated above, will make my heart palpitate and my ovaries melt etc. Bu I will also feel awkward as hell and my shyness, social anxiety and innate insecurities will just magnify thrice over. I won\u2019t be able to approach the guy and will most likely end up admiring him from afar, wistfully. They don\u2019t think you are single - Assuming you are good looking, not an asshole, and can string two words together articulately, most women will think you are taken and consider you off limits. In fact most guys who are half- decent and are good looking tend to already be in a relationship more often than not. Good things are seldom available! Women will often fear that you are a ''playah'' Look assuming you are aesthetically blessed , more often than not you will not be lacking any shortage of options when it comes dating. So, it will often trigger anxiety/insecurity in many prospective dates ( those who are looking for a serious relationship) that you can be a potential player ... simply because it's relatively easier for you to land a date. I know this argument will hardly seem logical, but human beings are seldom logical when it comes to matters of the heart. ",

            "answer_text": "I have friend in office who is over 6 ft tall and have really nice physic also he is handsome. He never had a girlfriend. He is a simple and a good hearted boy. But when he talks it might appear to girls that he is not mature enough. Girl might read his innocence as his immaturity. I had another friend in college in my department and he is really very handsome. Recently he has settled with a average looking girl. He was single for a long time. I guess he was so smart and handsome that girls might have felt inferiority complex in front of his looks and personality. Most of the handsome fellows knows their worth. They don't want to settled for less. They have been approached by many girls and they waited for the real one he was looking for. Many came but they still continued searched for the right one. Some are shy and don't know how to talk or how to approach to girl. Some fall in love instantly and express their feeling so early that the girl doesnot find it unusual and stops replying texts. Some are really smart and career oriented sort of nerd. Some are more into gym, studies, sports. In most cases a Girl always likes a boy who is more like Ravan (Please don't go into 10 headed typical Ravan look). I am talking about the character. Today I was having a word with my friend and she sent a pic in whatsapp.  What she meant is they don't bother about the guy\u2019s look so much. They are more into character. They subconsciously rejects the guy who might reject/ ditch them in future. Some girl are philosophical they are more into the vibe, guy\u2019s nature, Smile, Honesty, social life etc. Some handsome guys are not born rich also not so bright as a student so a girl falls for him initially but try not to go for a serious relationship with a guy who doesnot have a very bright future. Some handsome guys are so obsessed with their looks and taking selfies and posting them which sometimes girls find it lame. Some handsome guys are gay. I haven't seen anyone so far. Just an assumption. This is how an average or below average guy ends up with dating/marrying the best looking girl from your college. P.S: I am not a handsome guy. P.P.S: perspectives can differ from person to person. ",
