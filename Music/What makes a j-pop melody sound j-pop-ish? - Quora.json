            "answer_text": "J-pop encompasses multiple genres, Pop, Rock, Electro Pop,Dance, R'n'B, Ballads and more. It's hard to explain, it's like when you hear the melody of a song you know it's Japanese. So I did some research like origins and instrument of J-pop. A unique characteristic of J-pop is \u201ccutesy\u201d music. This music could be said to be approximately a mixture of \u201cbubblegum\u201d pop and children\u2019s popular music. Japanese \u201ccutesy\u201d artists are always female and they often fuse sexuality and child-likeness together in a subtle manner. What are the Stylistic origins of J-pop? These are dance-pop, synthpop, Europop, jazz fusion, electropop, house, bitpop and Kay\u014dkyoku. We are all familiar with this genres except for Kay\u014dkyoku. So what is Kay\u014dkyoku? Kay\u014dkyoku (\u6b4c\u8b21\u66f2?, literally \"Pop Tune\") is a Japanese pop music genre, which became a base of modern J-pop. The Japan Times describes kay\u014dkyoku as \"standard Japanese pop\" or \"Showa era pop\" (Source: The Ventures: still rocking after 50 years | The Japan Times Jazz icon Akiko Yano finds her electronic muse | The Japan Times). Kay\u014dkyoku is Western-style-inspired music of Japan. Music in this genre is extremely varied as a result. Kay\u014dkyoku in the narrower and more practical sense, however, excludes J-pop and enka.What are the Typical instruments of J-pop? These are Voices samples, drum machine, sampler, synthesizer, PC, Keyboard, Vocals and Vocaloid. Vocaloid and Synthesizer are also one of the known J-pop instruments in Japan. Vocaloid (\u30dc\u30fc\u30ab\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9 B\u014dkaroido?) is a singing voice synthesizer. The software enables users to synthesize singing by typing in lyrics and melody. It uses synthesizing technology with specially recorded vocals of voice actors or singers. To create a song, the user must input the melody and lyrics. A piano roll type interface is used to input the melody and the lyrics can be entered on each note. The software can change the stress of the pronunciations, add effects such as vibrato, or change the dynamics and tone of the voice. Each Vocaloid is sold as \"a singer in a box\" designed to act as a replacement for an actual singer. It is intended for professional musicians as well as light computer music users and has so far sold on the idea that the only limits are the users' own skills. (Source:Vocaloid)Synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate new electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled via MIDI or CV/Gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller. (Source: Synthesizer)Emergence of Music J-pop uses both traditional and foreign music influences to create new style of music and genre (I don\u2019t even know the names of those genres. It\u2019s so many). Not just in J-pop but to other genres too. Just like BABYMETAL. Their genre is kawaii-metal (fusion of metal and idol music). That might be the reason why J-pop is so different to Western Pop. I hope my answer helps. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s melodic, with a happy or nostalgic feeling about it sometimes.It\u2019s a long song. Longer than a typical western song. The song scheme is often different too: (Sometimes chorus intro) - Refrain1 - (Refrain2 sometimes) - Chorus - Refrain3 - (Refrain4 again sometimes) - Chorus - Instrumental - Bridge - Chorus - (sometimes chorus is repeated, maybe in a different key)Refrains can be longer because it\u2019s a different language and they may need a different length to express what needs to be expressed. And it may also be a different taste in music.Also, the transition between refrain and chorus can be unexpected for westerners. We are used to a \u2018lineal\u2019? transition, so to say; but in J-pop a sudden key change sometimes happens when the chorus comes in and it can be distracting if it\u2019s the first time you hear the song. It is more noticeable when you don\u2019t know the language and all you can catch is the music. Example of a song in which the chorus progression was unexpected: And example of a song in which the progression was as expected:  And as you can see, both songs are slightly above 5\u2032. The average western pop song is 3\u20135\u2032, usually between 3\u20325\u2033 and 4\u2032. 6. Key changes are not only in the chorus. Here after the intro, the melody plays in a different key. Not very typical in western music.  7. Sometimes it is difficult to know which genre the song is. J-pop uses genres in a ver lax way that is open for inter-mingling. It sounds like pop, rock, ballad, jazz\u2026 all at the same time. This is why I like to call it indie. An example of \u2018indie\u2019  I also like to call it indie due to the different harmonies and melodies; because yes, this is dream pop, but I haven\u2019t seen many songs actually like this in western music. This is like very sweet dream pop :) and one of my faves. Everything sounds sweeter and happier in Japanese, be it glam rock, heavy metal, pop\u2026  Another characteristic feature: octave change and ample intervals, musically speaking. More so than in Western music. The singers do it like it is common, but it is not, to those not used to j-pop. I particularly don\u2019t enjoy octave change and ample intervals in songs too much, because in my opinion that can sort of break the song\u2019s harmony and even feel forced (my view as a non-Japanese j-pop listener).  Some songs sound like something you\u2019ve already heard. For example, she sounds like Avril Lavigne because of the melody, harmonies and generally how the song is built. I\u2019m particularly thinking of \u201cWhen You Are Gone\u201d by Avril Lavigne.   ",

            "answer_text": "Traditionally, it\u2019s the melody itself. Western pop and a lot of K-Pop places emphasis on the beat over the melody, but the opposite\u2019s true for J-Pop. The melody conventions of the genre are rooted in 20th century American jazz, and one of the key chord progressions in J-Pop, known as the Royal Road, has quite a jazzy vibe to it. ",
