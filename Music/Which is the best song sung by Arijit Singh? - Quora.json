            "answer_text": "Arijit Singh is presently my Favourite singer , previously Sonu Nigam, I came to know him after the release of his one of the most loved song \u2018Tum hi hoon\u2019 from the movie Aashiqui 2. From then I have been always waiting for his release of new songs. Honestly his voice is full of love. The word \u2018best\u2019 depends from person to person , so for me the following songs are the best, have a look: Tum hi hoonChahun Main Ya NaaMilne Hai Mujhse AayiKabiraMast MaganMuskurane from City LightsSamjhawanSun Le ZaraHumdard from Ek VillainSaanson koKhamoshiyanTu har lamhaBaatein Ye Kabhi NaJudaai from BadlapurAgar Tum Saath Ho\u2014-> Ok , I have admit , this song was a magic , when I listened this for the first time , I felt/imagined that I was in love with anonymous girl ,I felt she cares for me\u2026\u2026\u2026.., but as the song ended I came back to my senses only to realise I imagined for the first time and it didn\u2019t happened earlier. But when I played it next time, I never felt the magic again , OK Emotions\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. GeruaJanam JanamDaayreTera ChehraBolna from Kapoor & SonsIjazatItni Si Baat HainChunarSawareDekha Hazaro DafaaKabhi jo Badal BarseZara Si DostiPhir Kabhi \u2014\u2192 I felt this song when M. S. Dhoni gave up the captaincy that too on my Birthday\u2026..We can relate the lyrics wth the situation as well \u2026\u2026.He may play for India again , but we will definitely miss his brilliant captaincy and the memories. Ae Dil Hai MuskilChanna BulleyaAlizehNaina from DangalZaalimaPhir Bhi Tumko Chahunga \u2014\u2192The intense love and longing and desire for someone whom you miss or love passionately!!

            "answer_text": "T4A the question. As Ariki has proved himself in the recent times as a versatile singer. It's difficult to choose one of it. Also the question says which song do you like, which makes it easy to answer. There would be very few people in India who don't like Arijit at all, but it's for sure that his numerous songs would be in everyone's playlist from the recent era. (Indian youth from 90\u2019s and further) And the love for his any song depends upon any individual in the way that can relate to his/her\u2019s personal life. I like most the song \u201cPhir le aya Dil\u201d from Barfi. It just touches you in every possible way to feel the love , affection and state of mind. As he is becoming popular with his solo Romantic and Semi-Classic songs one cannot deny or avoid his songs to listen. Also he has never kept his genre singular but delivered Fast and party numbers with the same energy and has made total justice with other genres too. Other songs which I are as follows in the decsending order from Most loved to The Least. Tum hi ho\u2026 (Aashiqui2)Chahu Main Ya Na\u2026(Aashiqui2)Chan na Mereya\u2026(Aee Dil Hai Mushkil)Tu Hi Hai Aashiqui (Solo Version)\u2026(Dishkiyaoon)Kabira\u2026(Yeh Jawani Hain Deewani)Muskurane ki wajah\u2026(City Lights)Dilli wali Girlfriend\u2026(Yeh Jawani Hain Deewani)Tere Hoke rahenge\u2026(Raja Natwarlal)Itni si baat hai\u2026(Azhar)Bolna\u2026(Kapoor and Sons)Ye Fitoor\u2026(Fitoor)Hamari Adhuri Kahani\u2026(Hamari Adhuri Kahani)O Soniye\u2026(Titoo MBA) and so on. The list can be continued for long because he has given much more hit songs from 2012 till date and he is going great still. May you find this list similar to your\u2019s . THANKS AND CHEERS TO ARIJIT.",
