            "answer_text": "Yes he does. I think, he has been doing that since the beginning. Drake stated in an interview that Wayne just listens to the beat for some time and sits on it. After some time, he hops in the studio killing the track. Wayne also stated in his lyrics like \u2018A milli\u2019 he says \u201cI don\u2019t write sh*t \u2018cause I ain\u2019t got time\u201d. It\u2019s all about practice. He freestyles in the booth. Rappers like Jay z do not write down the words. They just make it in their minds. I think even Tyga doesn\u2019t write lyrics down. They freestyle when they hear the track and that\u2019s really genius. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes this is true. Lil Wayne does, in fact, make his music off the top of his head. He does it extremely well and not only that but very articulately. His metaphors and similes are unmatchable considering that he has been out since the 90\u2019s. He does not write down lyrics whatsoever. He is one of the few rappers who have not only achieved but somewhat trademarked this talent within the music industry and the hip-hop community. ",
