            "answer_text": "Renting an apartment in Japan can sometimes be very difficult and expensive. You have to pay a lot of money upfront when you sign the contract. A lot! But actually there\u2019s a very good alternative available these days and if you\u2019re 19 (or any age at all) it\u2019s perfect for you. I would\u2019ve loved something like this when I was your age. They are called share houses. There used to be a lot of company housing in Japan, a lot of apartment buildings were put up and a company would put all of their employees in that building. But companies are moving out of that kind of activity and these apartment buildings are being taken up by companies that renovate them for young people as share houses. Generally in a share house there\u2019s a common kitchen, a common living room and some general spaces. Then in your private room (with a lock on the door) you might have just room for a bed and closet, a desk. There will be shared bathing facilities and bathrooms on each floor. You pay a reasonable rent for your room but you get all the benefits of a full kitchen and living room and other people who have a similar age and interests as you living around you. You can take part or not take part as you feel. Recently a friend was able to stay in a share house for a couple of months and I went to visit her. It was a lovely place and everyone was friendly and hanging out in the kitchen and living room area. It was quite large, four stories, and had room for about 100 people. And if you don\u2019t want to do things with others, you don\u2019t have to. Look on the Internet for share houses. And living in this particular share house were lots of young Japanese office workers and a number of young foreigners visiting Japan and working or going to school. And they just loved it. Some are huge apartment complexes and quite large. Some are just a house with three or four bedrooms and so they will only be one person in each bedroom. I would expect to have a lock on my door and that would be a kind of privacy. In the larger places there will be several refrigerators in the kitchen and you can keep things in the refrigerator with your name on them. You can cook by yourself or you can do things as a group. Again as you feel - no pressure to do things together. Here is an example but there are many others on the Internet: \u30b7\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30a6\u30b9\u30c9\u30fc\u30df\u30fc \u5357\u67cf\uff5c\u3072\u3064\u3058\u4e0d\u52d5\u7523 ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re moving to Japan to be a student, you should write or email the school you will be attending and ask them where their students live while going to their school. Me - I live 8,000 miles away. I\u2019m not the one you should be posing this question to. What if I told you something, and it turned out to be 100% wrong? Then you\u2019d be in Japan cursing me out for the wrong answer. Worse, your school would be having second thoughts about admitting you to their school, when they find out that your idea of solving a problem is to ask some guy who lives 8,000 miles away and doesn\u2019t know you or your school.

There are many real estate agencies today that specialize in foreigner rentals for people who do not know much Japanese. Please look for them online. They can give you the best advice as to what you will need to rent your own place. The below is ONE example. Student housing and accommodation for students Tokyo, Japan ",
