            "answer_text": "As Runako says, and as should be clear from the other responses, jurisdiction matters. What exactly you are allowed to do will depend critically on that question. For example in the UK there is no concept of \"fair use\", which is (now) an essentially US doctrine. Which law applies is actually a complicated, and not entirely resolved, question. The internet is international, copyright law is not. It is entirely possible for a website to infringe copyright in country A even though it is hosted, managed and run from country B by people domiciled and working there. From a UK perspective (copyright law is harmonised across the UK), the lyrics of a song will almost always attract copyright. Unless the song is relatively old (no-one is going to worry about \"It was a Lover and His Lass\") you would ordinarily need the permission of the owner of the copyright in the lyrics to use them or a substantial part of them, on a website. There are a *very* large number of exceptions to copyright in the UK - all of them fairly tightly defined. One of them is \"fair dealing for the purposes of criticism or review\", see s30 of the Copyright Act: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/30 This means that it may be fair (say) to quote from the lyrics of a song in order to criticise it, or to criticise some other work or class of works, provided that doing so is also \"fair dealing\" and sufficient acknowledgment is given. Providing the whole of the lyrics of the song is almost certainly not \"fair\" dealing, though exactly what is and is not fair will depend considerably on context. A website arguing that \"Happy Birthday\" is not (despite claims to the contrary) protected by copyright, might want to include all the (very minimal) lyrics of it in order to analyse it properly. If *someone else* posts the lyrics that is another matter - but I don't think you are asking that question. ",

            "answer_text": "USA or UK (or elsewhere)? The correct answer is that the law of the country in which you are based may apply. For example, in the UK, you can post the lyrics as long as the creator gives their permission. Simple. Usually, a problem only occurs if someone notifies you that they own the copyright to those lyrics and there is a potential to cause a loss (i.e. Piracy). If this occurs, you should find out who created the lyrics and get their permission. If the person claiming misuse is the creator, you must take them down or risk being sued. There is a practical difference in the way Copyright law is applied to anyone hosting copyright material as a hobby and someone who is or aims to profit from it. ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily.  In the US, posting lyrics may qualify as \"fair use\", particularly if you are using only partial lyrics as part of criticism or in a transformative work.  For example, it's absolutely fair use to quote a couple of lines as part of a music review.   However, \"fair use\" is a tricky concept without a lot of bright lines, and many artists take an overly-expansive view of copyright.  You'll want to proceed with caution in this area outside of anything other than straightforward criticism. ",
