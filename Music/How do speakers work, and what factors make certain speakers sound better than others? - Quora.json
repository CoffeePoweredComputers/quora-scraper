            "answer_text": "Speakers are basically a motor that causes a diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm causes changes in air pressure which are sensed by your ears. It\u2019s hard to reproduce with exact fidelity, the original sound. And of course, the speakers can\u2019t add missing fidelity, so anything that was lost during recording is gone. Speaker designers have to balance cost, speaker size, efficiency, frequency range, flatness of frequency response, power handling, and other factors. Better would generally mean, what\u2019s better sounding to you. But to me, I don\u2019t care if it sounds better to me. I want a flat response. Meaning high fidelity. If it sounds worse, but is more accurate, give me more accurate. If you don\u2019t mind losing some bass, \u201cmonitor\u201d speakers, the kind designed to critical evaluate music in a recording studio, or home studio would be good, for getting a flat response, as that should be their goal. Getting accurate bass down to low numbers, like 30hz, is hard, so most people just use a power subwoofer. But you can buy close to full range speakers that don\u2019t need a subwoofer. But it will cost you. Some of the best speakers I ever heard did cost a LOT of money. Probably over 10k USD in today\u2019s money. There is a difference. But most people have to settle for good enough. Look at brands like Emotiva, Polk, Dayton Audio, Pioneer ( the Jones designed ones are well regarded,) Yamaha, and other respected brands ( typically NOT Bose.) For powered subwoofers, look at Dayton Audio and Hsu ( my goto brands for powered subs.) For the record, I own B&W speakers in my main system, with Emotiva subwoofers ( because I got a killer deal on two subwoofers, and I use two to help balance out the standing waves you get with low frequencies.) B&W are nice, but they are not efficient, which is their downside - in other words, they take more amplifier power than, for example, Klipsch bookshelf speakers. When choosing speakers, start with a budget. Also decide if you want: Book shelf speakers by themselvesBook shelf speakers with a powered subwooferFloorstanding speakers with or without subwooferA full home theater ( surround sound) setup for 5.1 ( typically 5 bookshelf speakers and a powered subwoofer)Then if you can, listen to speakers in person to get some idea. But note that speakers are effected by your room acoustics, so you can\u2019t get a perfect idea of them when listening to a showroom setup. ",

            "answer_text": "Most speakers are known as dynamic speakers. They have a cone that has a coil of wire at the bottom. This coil is surrounded with a permanent magnet. A coil that has an electric current flowing through it will be attracted or repelled to a magnetic field depending on the direction of flow of current in the coil. Putting an audio current through the coil will cause the coil to be attracted and repelled as the audio current is an alternating one, changing direction with the frequency of the audio current. This will cause the cone of the speaker to move, or vibrate, at the rate of the audio current. This will move the air in front of the cone and produce sound replicating the audio current from the amplifier. Many things are done in a high quality speaker to reproduce the sound as accurately as possible. A light weight cone and a means of stopping the cone when the current stops is important to prevent the cone from making sound when there is no signal. This is called dampening. Also a magnet as strong as possible will help to dampen the cone. The stronger the current the greater the movement of the cone but this will also try to move the coil out of the magnetic field. This will produce distortion and is undesired. A strong magnet will also help keep the coil in the field of the magnet. A means of keeping the coil centered in the magnet has to be provided. The cone itself is the main means but a suspension ring around the base of the cone also helps. This must be very flexible so as not the restrict the movement and must provide equal tension around the cone to keep the cone centered. The cone must also be free to move back and forth as easily as possible to accurately follow the current. The cone must also be stiff so as to not distort with the forces put on it from the coil. It is easy to see that many of the requirements are difficult to achieve as the requirement is at odds with the mechanical need. This is where the expenses arise. To achieve optimum performance the selection of exotic and expensive materials and techniques are used. Another consideration is the coil itself as considerable force can be generated with high power. It is possible for the wire to actually be torn off of the form is is on, destroying the speaker. This is known as \u201cblowing the speaker\u201d Also a size of wire large enough to carry the current is needed causing inertia from the weight which degrades the performance. It is all a balancing act to attain the best performance. The best speakers are not cheap but that is where the best sound is produced. I does not matter how good everything before the speakers is if the the speakers do not reproduce the sound accurately. ",
