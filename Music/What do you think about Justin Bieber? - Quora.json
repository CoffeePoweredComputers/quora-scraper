            "answer_text": "I know not everyone might agree, but for me, he\u2019s the definition of mediocrity.  I mean, his songs aren\u2019t bad, as far as commercial pop tunes go. They\u2019re certainly catchy, they\u2019re inoffensive, they do their job. But there\u2019s nothing that really stands out about the guy, either, at least musically. His voice is pretty average, his music is indistinguishable from the litany of other songs on the radio written in nearly the exact same style, and he doesn\u2019t have much lyrical content or context that would make his music interesting. I mean, say what you want about \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d by Taylor Swift: the song might be an over-dramatic, cluttered mess, but at least it\u2019s interesting. That\u2019s not really something I can say about the Biebs, but again, some might disagree. For me, though, he\u2019s the definition of mediocrity. (That\u2019s at least better than what I could say about his earliest material\u2026but that\u2019s another story for another answer.) ",

            "answer_text": "I think his music sucks. A friend of mine worked for an outlet in which he did the engineering for broadcast & Justin was doing a spot for on T.V. He was promoting an album. There was a meet & greet afterwards. Justin was unhappy with the album & told these young kids not to buy the album. Justin, before hand at rehearsal was singing Led Zeppelin & other classics & was killing it. Truthfully, he doesn't want to do the music he's doing & he\u2019s just doing it to have a career but, the music is sub par & is not what he is really good at. He should stick to rock & roll or another genre that he's better at & he would be much happier & have a wider net of fans. ",
