            "answer_text": "I am certain there are Quorans far better qualified to answer this question. But as far as I can tell, African-American culture is at root a consequence of West African cultures meshing with parts of White Southern (British-based) cultures within the turbulent environment of American slavery. Various cultural memes\u2014ranging from how some people pronounce the word \u201cwater\u201d, to fried chicken, to rhythm/percussion-based music\u2014are obviously the result of the clash between those two worlds. Way back in the day, Scottish people cooked fried chicken, but left it very bland. Then later brought that tradition to the American South. Black slaves put their twist on the dish. Now we call fried chicken Soul/Southern cuisine. European music was once more melodic than percussive, while African music often focused on complex rhythm and drums. Hence, Black/American popular music (jazz, blues, contemporary gospel, soul, hip-hop). There are numerous examples like this, which in my opinion, reinforce my beliefs about the origins of Black American culture. ",
