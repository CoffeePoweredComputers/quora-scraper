            "answer_text": "I would say plagiarism is the act of intentionally using the arrangement/chord sequence and top line melody of another song or piece of music. There have been occasions where I genuinely discovered music that had already been discovered. One example is Elton Johns \u2018song for guy'. The method I was using for writing at the time was chord exploration. I came across four lovely sounding chords and believed I had something fresh due to the way I was syncopating and the top line I was preferring. However, when I heard \u2018Song for guy \u2018 I realised it was very close. Had I accidently plagiarised? Although it is entirely possible, I do not believe so. At the time I was near the beginning of my musical development and favoured synth type electronic acts. Elton was far too traditional for me! I was not such a fan. Additionally; I did not write this tune in my head. It came slowly over an extended period of various experimental improvising around different chord sequences. The fact I ended up liking this particular chord sequence I believe was due to my personal taste and nothing else. It was simply coincidence. This raises an interesting question\u2026.. If an artist genuinely writes a piece of music that is entirely original in his experience of life (the artist has never heard the other one that happened first) Does this make this artist just as special as the one who came first with the tune? I would suggest so. If a man in Australia invented the wheel 6000 BC but a woman in Iceland invented the wheel in 4000 BC and none knew about the other, then they both genuinely invented the wheel!

            "answer_text": "Simple - you do research, ask around, and sometimes you just end up plagiarizing by mistake. I \u2018ll use two Beatles stories to illustrate. Macca had awoke one morning and sat down at his piano and wrote a song with the working title,\u201dscrambled eggs\u201d. He tightened up those lyrics and just had the feeling that they had come from elsewhere. He spent weeks playing the song to people and asking them if it sounded familiar. Getting no responses to indicate that it wasn\u2019t original, the Beatles recorded and released \u201cYesterday,\u201d one of the most covered songs of all time. In contrast, after the breakup of the Beatles, George Harrison had such a backlog of songs that he released a triple album. It was a big hit, and the single \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d also made an impact on the charts. Unfortunately, the record company that had released a song by the Chiffons called \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d sued him because of the very close nature of the melodies, and prevailed in court. The judge, in his ruling, declared that the plagiarism was unintended, but he still had to pay the Chiffons. So, it can happen to the best of them. ",
