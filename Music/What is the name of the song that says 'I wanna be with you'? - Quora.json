            "answer_text": "I am sure that there are several, but I'm thinking of \u201cI Wanna Be With You\u201d by The Raspberries, a huge hit in the early '70s. The Raspberries and their British counterparts Badfinger were stars of the style known as \u201cPower Pop\u201d, which married Beatles-esque melodies with the crunching power chords of The Who. Other Raspberries hits include \u201cGo All the Way\u201d, \u201cTonight\u201d and \u201cLet's Pretend.\u201d The breakup of The Beatles left a void impossible for any artist to even begin to fill, but The Raspberries should be given some credit for stepping up to the plate. Eric Carmen, lead singer of the band, also happens to have a singing voice quite similar to Paul McCartney. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1972 there was a group from Ohio that had a hit with the song \u201cI Wanna Be With You\u201d. They were called The Raspberries and went on to have other hits and released several albums before they broke up. My Ex-Wife claimed she knew the lead singer Eric Carmen because she was from the Cleveland area. ",
