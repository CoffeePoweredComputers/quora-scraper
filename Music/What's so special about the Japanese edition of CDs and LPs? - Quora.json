            "answer_text": "Even back in the pre-CD days, Japanese vinyl pressings were prized for their quality, both in manufacturing and in the record companies demand for the best quality tapes available to master from, sometimes even persuading companies to allow the master tapes to be used. If not that, a safety copy would sometimes be the closest to the master, often multiple generations better than many other countries were allowed to use for local pressings. Japanese audiophiles demanded this quality, and often had the best mastering and pressings available in the world. They fetched higher prices accordingly. The same quality concerns carried over into the CD era, when many record companies were mistakenly using masters created for LPs for their CD issues as well. CD technology was immature, and many sonic errors were made early on. Japanese companies would often compete for improved quality, and still demanded the best quality materials to master from. One such improvement which I haven\u2019t seen used in any US releases is SHM-CD, a special high quality polycarbonate plastic used to manufacture the CDs, with what is claimed to be better sound as a result; these CDs sell for a premium, so I suppose those claims might have some validity. Here\u2019s a little promo info from Universal in Japan: All About SHM-CD Format ",

            "answer_text": "Japan has different laws pertaining to how music rights are distributed. If I remember correctly, artists get to set their rate that the music companies must follow, and the companies need profit too, so it just gets expensive fast. This is offset with special editions and extra songs in some Japanese versions of albums. ",
