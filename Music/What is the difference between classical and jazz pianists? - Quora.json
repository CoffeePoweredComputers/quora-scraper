            "answer_text": "As both a classical and jazz pianist, the main different between both styles is that jazz piano relies primarily on improvisation for musical material, while classical piano primarily involves the execution of precomposed scores. In order to meet repertoire needs, classical piano technique tends to be more orchestral than jazz piano, especially in its modern manifestations. To be sure, jazz pianists such as Jellyroll Morton, Willie \u201cthe lion\u201d Smith, James P. Johnson, Teddy Wilson, Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson were technical wizzards, reducing most ordinary pianists to puddles of embarrassment at their feet. However, since the 1950s, most jazz piano has followed the bebop model of the single-note right hand with left hand accompaniment. Of course, every trend has notable exceptions: Erroll Garner, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Barry Harris, Marcus Roberts, Chucho Valds\u00e9, Gonzalo Rubalcaba and the remarkable Eldar. However, jazz piano\u2019s predominant aesthetic is light and \u201chip\u201d. This demarcation line along improvisational lines was not always so rigid. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Busoni and other classical pianist/composers were master improvisers, to the point that many of their most intricate pieces began as improvisations. The grand French organ tradition of Widor was kept alive until the late 1980s by Olivier Messiaen, Francis Poulenc and other master organ improvisers. Vladimir Horowitz was said to have improvised breathtaking renditions of \u201cTea For Two,\u201d dividing his two hands into four simultaneous parts. On the jazz side, most piano rags, such as those by Scott Joplin, were notated in some form, although minor improvisation also probably took place. Many stride classics such as \u201cCarolina Shout\u201d or \u201cHandfull of Keys\u201d were probably improvised so many times by their creators that they almost became fully-composed pieces. ",
