            "answer_text": "Well, I love cooking. But while I\u2019m good enough not to mess up most dishes I\u2019m familiar with, I strongly doubt that I\u2019ve perfect them enough to get the same dish exactly right every single time. A professional chef, on the other hand, will make far, far, fewer significant mistakes, and likely has countless recipes rolling around their head. Works the same way with pro musicians. In fact, music that isn\u2019t part of work or school tends to be as easy to remember for musicians as it is for everyone else (which is to say, it varies.) After having studied them, I have pretty confidently memorized the handful of songs I sang this semester for my voice lessons, and I still remember a good number of songs I\u2019ve performed with my college\u2019s choir, semesters ago. But when it comes to songs I don\u2019t need to practice and rehearse daily, even if I listen to them on repeat for days, I won\u2019t necessarily remember the words without looking them up. And that seems, to me at least, pretty accurate across the board. Some people are good at remembering songs. Some are less good at it. And musicians tend to be better at it when it is part of our work, because it\u2019s our job. Most people learn the ropes of their job pretty quickly, and don\u2019t forget how to do it for a long time, right? That\u2019s how singers can remember so many songs. Lots of practice, and a paycheck. ",

            "answer_text": "In my late revival of my music career stage fright was a thing of the past, but\u2026.. I was terrified of forgetting my lyrics. There was so much to remember and with only a couple of short tours each year it wasn't enough to imprint the words in my shrinking brain. I hated doing it, but I had to always have a music stand on which I put my printed lyrics\u2026..in large print and with a light so they didn't suddenly disappear as the lights changed. I tried to be as discreet as possible, only glancing down quickly to get the first line of a verse. The rest automatically followed\u2026.in most cases. However, a moment's loss of concentration could result in me looking down and missing which verse I was on. This happened at a big festival in Austin, Texas a few years back. I had to resort to a bit of la la la until I found my right place in a eleven minute multi versed song. Terrible. I was so furious with myself\u2026and cringe now just thinking about it. And, of course, a fan filmed the number on their mobile and uploaded it\u2026. I am truly amazed at Bob Dylan's phenomenal memory for his chords and keys\u2026.and his endless lyrics. But I guess if you play virtually every night it might be possible. ",
