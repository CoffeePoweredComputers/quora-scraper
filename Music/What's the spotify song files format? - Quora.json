            "answer_text": "Spotify uses Ogg Vorbis as their streaming format. While the songs can be \u201cdownloaded\u201d (stored offline) on a Premium subscription, they are not available in the same way a song you buy on iTunes would be. You have no actual physical access to the file and can not move it to another application to play it there. The way to access files offline on Spotify is to create a playlist and then on your mobile device to go the playlist and choose to have it \u201cAvailable offline\u201d. That will download the files to Spotify and allows you to be offline for up to 30 days and still have access to the songs.

            "answer_text": "Spotify uses three different quality settings for streaming, all in the Ogg Vorbis format. The \"normal\" default Spotify streaming quality on your computer is 160 kbps, or 96 kbps on mobile devices. If you pay the monthly fee for Spotify Premium, you'll get 320kbps which is \"high quality\" on desktop and \"extreme quality\" on mobile. With Spotify Premium subscription, you can stream music from Spotify for offline listening. But the offline streaming playlists are essentially cached stream, and not individually stored songs. When the songs are cached, they are encrypted, so it would not be possible to remove them. ",
