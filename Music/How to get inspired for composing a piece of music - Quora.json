            "answer_text": "Well, that\u2019s an interesting question, and one whose answer is going to depend on why you\u2019re asking. I\u2019m speaking from my own personal experience here, but I firmly believe that, if you are an inherently creative person, there isn\u2019t a force in the world that could stop you from creating - you write poems or prose, you draw or paint, you write music or perform it\u2026 creativity is like an energy that must be released or it feels as though it might just pop you like a balloon. If you\u2019re that type of person, and you\u2019re feeling uninspired at the moment, don\u2019t sweat it! Sometimes inspiration takes a holiday, but never fear, your muse will return, and you\u2019ll find inspiration again. The thing to do is to let your mind and heart be open, observe the things around you as you go through your daily life with interest, and something will tweak your creativity and you\u2019ll be off. If you\u2019re not an inherently creative person - if, for example, you\u2019ve never found yourself doing something creative (writing, drawing, composing, whatever\u2026) at 4 in the morning, with no idea how you got there, because you\u2019re last coherent thought about the time was from the early afternoon the previous day (some people call this being \u201cin the zone\u201d, I call it \u201cgetting trampled by the muse\u201d) - then your task is to find inspiration and it\u2019s a little tougher. My mentor in composition, the great Michel Rochon, gave me a trick that I\u2019ve used on several occasions when I had a commission or something that I couldn\u2019t get inspired for (the muse can be fickle), and it\u2019s resulted in some successful pieces: set yourself some rules within which you must make your composition work. They can be anything, one example that I used was that each instrument or section in the orchestra could play only one note - they could play it long or short, loud, soft, repeated as many times as necessary but each instrument or section was \u201cstuck\u201d on that one note. The rule(s) that you set will impose certain restrictions on how you compose the piece (with my rule, for example, in order to create any melody, I had to \u201csequence\u201d different instruments, having one play after the other). It will give your technical mind something to grapple with, and hopefully ignite your creativity, necessity being the mother of invention. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a couple approaches you can take. APPROACH 1: Biographical/Historical Write down 2\u20133 important events from your life or history. Think about the emotional tone and themes of these events. What did the emotional journey look like? Where did it start, where did it end up? Map out your experience of the event and use that as the form for your piece. Choose key centers or notes/patterns that reflect your relationship with that event. Start to develop your ideas and keep returning to the event(s) for inspiration. APPROACH 2: Music You Already Love Make a short list of music that you love listening to, say 5 songs. Next to each song, write one thing you love about it. Maybe it\u2019s the beat, or the lyrics, or the crazy way the trombone player blares a solo. Now take those characteristics, and start to combine them. Make a mash up. It\u2019s the beat from \u201cEverybody Dance Now\u201d with the melody line from \u201cHappy\u201d, but in a different key, and with the emotional character of Shostakovich symphony #10 movement 2. Use these musical qualities and inspirations as building blocks for a unique mash up piece. You know what composer Igor Stravinsky supposedly said, \u201cA good composer does not imitate; he steals\u201d. APPROACH 3: Forget Inspiration and Just Work Books like The War of Art talk about just showing up. Don\u2019t insist on inspiration to do the work. Just set a timer for 30 minutes and write whatever you can. \u201cWrite for the trash can\u201d. Eventually if you keep showing up you\u2019ll produce quality output. Get Organized and Stay Focused Use timers and a notepad, or a music practice app like Modacity, to allocate time for different activities. Maybe you want to try all 3 approaches and give yourself 20 minutes for each one. Stay in touch with a clear purpose for why you are writing music - be it self-expression, or giving something beautiful to others, or just to celebrate how cool music is. Your purpose will help you create more. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a professional composer but I write music at a fairly prolific rate and I get my inspiration from just about everywhere. I literally can\u2019t help it. For me the key to being constantly inspired is being able to recognise ideas in a variety of ways. When I\u2019m listening to a song/film score etc I explore everything within it. I\u2019ve been doing this my whole life, for decades before I even started to learn to play & write music myself. It\u2019s that \u201ctraining\u201d that created an endless source of inspiration I now use. When I listen to music, I listen to the individual instruments, the melodies, the layering and mixing of the different sounds, the dynamics, the rhythms, the structure, the tones, the space, the drops & hit sections, the combinations, the effects & so much mire. Not just the \u201cschool\u201d list that we\u2019re taught to hear which is important too (timbre etc) but the individual and combined ideas that can be literal eg a specific melody or more obscure eg the melody or rhythm two instruments are making when heard together in one part of a song, the way specific reverb affects the overall mood etc. Each single idea (hundreds in every song) has the potential to go on to be the seed new song or musical piece in its own right or to enhance or change an existing one. They are my inspiration & it\u2019s endless. It\u2019s all about ideas and the ability to recognise, expand and explore them. If any single element of a musical piece can be inspiring by itself then it\u2019s impossible to ever run out of inspiration. For me anyway. What I don\u2019t have is enough time or the playing/writing skills to explore them all but I\u2019m getting there a little more each day. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there are couple of ways which could inspire for music composition. I don\u2019t know how you can get inspiration, but I do by Music That I Love To Hear This is my first inspiration for music composition. Whenever I want to compose music and I use to listen my beloved songs. And mostly I get inspiration from theses musical lines. Like that some things click our mind and that click lead me to the composition of music. Just listen music with time and attention and possibly you will get results. Imagination I do consider imagination a best part that helps me to compose music. Whenever we come across some interesting things we build imagination for them and if this imagination is strong it inspire us for music composition. To compose music is a different and versatile process it can be done in any way. Incidental Approach Yes, Off course sometimes inspiration may be a past incident. We have too many thoughts un our mind of past. Many incidents have a long and deep lasting effect on our present. These incidents also provides inspiration to compose a music. Hard Work and Devotion Everything is right and true but the main fact is to do hard work and pay attention and devotion to your music. This is the way that is 100% workable and authentic. Nothing could give you that you could achieve through hard work. Do again and gain and at last you will reach to the best ever possible results. Be focused and relaxed and get inspiration.

            "answer_text": "Birds, mostly. And other stuff. I guess. Oh, and snakes! Snakes are pretty cool. Nature in general. I write a lot of nature music. It helps that I live in the mountains, surrounded by birds and snakes. Not literally. That would be a terrifying existence, no matter how much I love birds and snakes. I\u2019d have to force my way through feathers and scales just to get to my composing desk! Actually, I\u2019m pretty sure I just write about stuff that\u2019s around me, in general. I\u2019ll see some crows hanging out by the music building, and say, \u201cOoh, crows are the best bird, I bet some neat crow tunes are in order.\u201d Or I\u2019ll be in the middle of an infatuation with some girl and use that week of new-crush-feelings to write some sappy love-dovey music. Or I\u2019ll read an answer on Quora about exploding stars and lethal paperclips, and go to write a really epic full orchestra showstopper with booming timpani and roaring brass! And then I\u2019ll get distracted reading more Quora answers, and forget what I was doing in the first place. Sometimes I\u2019ll hear a song that catches my ear, and I\u2019ll write something with that in mind. Mondays and Thursdays, I write more jazz, because I have jazz band rehearsals those mornings. Sometimes I have cool ideas for really big projects, but most of the time, those stay as ideas, because I don\u2019t have the time or patience to work on them piece-by-piece. I just want two months where I can just live in front of my work station and knock out all of my tarot card pieces, and my New-Orleans-jazz adaptation of The Magic Flute, and my seven-birds symphony, and my dream memoirs, and all the other wacky blueprints rattling around in my noggin at any given moment. But mostly, birds. Yup. Birds are neat. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people say a variation of lucidness, like inner mind, transcendental peace, or otherly imagine. Bullsh**. Like all art, we build on top of what is already there. Everything we've heard, everything we've liked, the things we dislike. What seems like pure imagination is just our magical brains reconstituting patterns in the primate way it evolved to do. The skill of a music writer (composing includes skills beyond music writing that aren't relevant here) lies in their discretion of these patterns. Anyone that tells you their piece came to them in a dream is either lying or has an objectively awful piece of work. But their inspirations can very well come from something natural. Inspiration is just 1% of the work needed to write music. ",

If someone asks me what inspires me to write, I never quite know what to say. But if someone asks me to describe what motivates me, I feel that that\u2019s a question I can answer. That\u2019s because most of the writing I do these days is because I\u2019ve been asked to do it, not specifically because I feel inspired. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t get excited about composing, of course. When someone says that they\u2019d like for me to compose something, let\u2019s say, for their choir, for a performance on a certain date, I feel highly motivated, and I find that musical ideas start popping into my mind, even at that beginning stage. It doesn\u2019t take much to get me excited about writing. If that\u2019s what you call inspiration, then I guess I\u2019m inspired. ",

Waiting for inspiration is a recipe for producing absolutely nothing. Inspiration comes during work. Once something comes up in an improvisation, or when just throwing ideas on paper, that may become the germinating starting point. A great way of exploring this \u201ctechnique\u201d is to study Beethoven\u2019s sketch books. You can often see just how he developed and expanded on simple ideas that he jotted down and began working on. As others have written here, yes, something like a good piece of music might inspire me, but only in the sense that it might inspire me to work. ",

            "answer_text": "It varies a lot. It depends on the mood I am in. But remember, in a composition, especially like the one I am specializing in, the Concerto for piano and orchestra, this is always an ongoing process. One cannot compose the entire piece, including the three movements, ( sometimes four) in a single day. So, I apply a principle that never fails me. I work on it. I change a passage. I change a substitution chord for an other, I change an instrument for an other, change the tempo, add or delete a repetition, sometimes, get tired of that composition. So, I let it rest for some times. A day, a week, I even went to a full years before restarting to work on it with new ideas. And so on. Slowly but surely, the piece takes a more and more definite form. And some more corrections. Often, I start the second movement before finishing the first. Sometimes even an other Concerto because suddenly I heard it in my head. IN a nutshell. there is no very short answer to this question. There are so many ways you get inspired. But, something for sure, I need some form of compulsion and obsession and desire to render it as beautiful as I can. Sometimes though it comes a lot easier, especially in shorter pieces such as a Rondo or a Scherzo since there are many repetition that are part of this form. Sometimes, the form is very loose such as in a rhapsody or a fantasy. I am fairly sure that should you ask this question to several composer, the answer is going to be the same. ",

It\u2019s artistry and the required almost mathematical nature as well. 2. Paul Mealor  (alright I picked a video I\u2019m in singing his stuff)So Paul is a student of Mathias and as such there are some similarities between them. I prefer Pauls more\u2026..stripped-down style which generally focuses on more complex chords at the expense of the rhythm (even though I often write much more rhythm focused pieces) 3. Jake Runestad  You may note a pattern here. All choral pieces. What can I say? I\u2019m a singer at heart. So again, heavy focus on driving rhythm and expansive harmony Three is enough? I\u2019ll leave it there. ",
