            "answer_text": "Personally,  I think it's due to the simple fact that people /think/ with more expletives now. Since a songwriter is basically just penning down thoughts in tune, I suppose he or she might end up using more expletives now than he/she did, ever before.  There is, however,  also the bit where I thunk some artists just make every third word of their song an expletive to make the song seem \"cool\". Yes, I did intend for the quotation marks. These artists are usually targeting a very selext and specific audience, usually teens and tweens who might enjoy such songs to either dance to, or simply sung just for the sake of the expletives. This is what I think, at least.  :) ",
