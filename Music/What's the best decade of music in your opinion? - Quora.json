            "answer_text": "The 1970s Though The Beatles already broke up, their music was still fresh and frequently played alongside their then new solo releases a decade later. The Rolling Stones might have had their best singles in the 1960s, but the 1970s ushered in the great albums Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street. In 1970s rock, audiences were exposed to the most creative periods of Jethro Tull, The Allman Brothers, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, The Who, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, KISS, and Queen; their work would blend in nicely with late-1960s music from Jefferson Airplane, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, etc. As a nice follow up to 1960s Motown, R&B presented The Sound of Philadelphia and the Motown stars who were by then under the subsidiary label Tamla Records. Among the artists, some new and some already established, who would flourish were The Spinners, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, a twenty something Stevie Wonder, a refined Marvin Gaye, Barry White, The Temptations, Diana Ross as a solo artist, The 3 Degrees, The Jacksons, Aretha Franklin, and Gladys Knight and the Pips. For lovers of pop frequently mixed in with rock, the 1970s easily whet those appetites. For many came to quickly know and embrace the works of Elton John, Rod Stewart, Fleetwood Mac, The Bee Gees, The Eagles, Chicago, The Doobie Brothers, and America. Outlaw country from the 1970s stood out as a noteworthy musical subgenre. Several who could not really get into country music from earlier periods had difficulty denying the guilty pleasure of listening to Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Kenny Rogers, and the like. The 1970s also stood out as the decade of the singer-songwriter. Among the best who fit the bill included Carole King, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Cat Stevens, Joni Mitchell, and Neil Young. One might also argue that the 1970s was the decade of the producer. It cannot be denied that Peter Asher was able to turn around the career of a somewhat struggling James Taylor, whose 1969 Apple Records debut did not exactly move up the charts. Perhaps my favorite account of how a producer likely saved an artist\u2019s career is what Phil Ramone did to make Billy Joel\u2019s studio work on par with his live performances, including the final touches applied to The Stranger and 52nd Street LPs. The 1970s was not perfect. It had its down side. The start of the decade included the deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Duane Allman, and Gene Vincent. The 1970s had its share of artists of which many of today's middle-agers are slow to admit they were ever among the screaming fans with those posters spread all over their bedroom walls. Returning to a serious note, the twilight of the 1970s included perhaps the darkest moment in rock and roll history. On August 16, 1977, we received news that The King of Rock and Roll, Mr. Elvis Presley, passed away at the age of 42. All in all, I again affirm that the 1970s was the best decade for music. One can make a case that the 1960s was the best decade for emerging artists, including those of the first musical British Invasion. I can go along with that. I am merely looking at it from the perspective of what was on the radio. If anything, the best of the 1970s songs encouraged the eschewing of some of the worst 1950s and 1960s tunes from many playlists. When the 1980s came along, the quality of radio, in my opinion, started to deteriorate. Personifying the decline is the spread out transitions of one band going from Jefferson Airplane to Jefferson Starship to Starship. And speaking of Jefferson Airplane to Jefferson Starship to Starship, the music scenario of the 1980s was perhaps best summarized by Ms. Grace Slick from a quote in the June 15, 2012 issue of Vanity Fair. It is this: \u201cIn the 80s we weren\u2019t writing our own songs. It was like being in L.A. rather than San Francisco. I like to write my own stuff or have the band members write their own stuff, and we weren\u2019t doing that. I was in my 40s and I remember thinking, God, this is just awful. But I was such an asshole for a while, I was trying to make up for it by being sober, which I was all during the 80s, which is a bizarre decade to be sober in. So I was trying to make it up to the band by being a good girl. Here, we\u2019re going to sing this song, \u2018We Built This City on Rock & Roll.\u2019 Oh you\u2019re shitting me, that\u2019s the worst song ever. I could do it, I could get up and imitate myself, but that doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you my favourite half decade: 1975\u20131980. It\u2019s not so much because all the music was great \u2014there was a lot of garbage then too\u2014but rather because it was a charmed period where music, recording technology, spirit and instrumentation all came together to just sound great. It can\u2019t be denied that there was wonderful music in the 60\u2019s or that the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s had some great things to offer, but to my ear, this five or six year window is when it all fell in place. To me, funk and r&b music prior to \u201975 was always a bit noisy, jangley and raw. Rock music similarly tended to have a loose noisy kind of feel. In \u201975 and the next few years, the music got tighter and richer, the recording technology got really crisp, and even the quality of instruments had improved. Drums took on a rich, warm sound, much different from the raw, crashing or hollow sounds leading up to that era. Guitars got fuller and more textured, and keyboards were tasty and organic, without the unrefined hollowness you\u2019d hear just a year or two earlier. Recording quality had come of age to where the whole group just sounded perfect. In 1980 and \u201881, though, it all went overboard. Synths and over-processing became the norm and all subsequent music lost the exquisite charm of the late \u201870\u2019s, never to be recaptured. But for that short window, the confluence of recording quality, music quality, and technology created an unmistakable sound, warm, human, rich, organic and crisp. To get an idea of the experience, you might listen to some Jimi Hendrix or some music like the Bar Kays or something, from \u201969 to maybe \u201973 or so. Then put on some headphones and listen to the Bee-Gees\u2019 \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d or Earth Wind & Fire\u2019s \u201cWritten in the Stone\u201d, to hear what that golden window really sounded like in its perfection. Real drums, and even strings and brass were authentic, clean and immediate. Then go ahead and listen to virtually any r&b or funk from 1981 and after, and you\u2019ll see what I mean: electronic and over-processed. What a difference a year makes, to paraphrase Dinah Washington. Or, if you\u2019re into rock, listen to something like some early Cream, CCR, or Guess Who, then listen to Boston or Styx, or one of the late 70\u2019s rock acts. Again, not saying this was the best music, only that it sounded the best. ",
