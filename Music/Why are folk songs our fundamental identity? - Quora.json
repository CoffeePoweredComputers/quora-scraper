            "answer_text": "I don't think they are to a lot of people these days. The days when folk songs represented many western communities have faded. Popular music is probably more likely. However, folk songs are usually about a community. They sing of shared legends, shared histories and experiences which were shared by our forebearers. This, in theory, links us to the community of the past whilst also linking us to those around who share that identity. This is not just \u201cethnic\" or \u201cpolitical\" communities. It can also be work communities, like sailors, miners, soldiers, farmers etc. But, as I said, these days I'd suggest more people are joined by pop songs than folk songs, although many folk songs have become pop songs too.

            "answer_text": "Whose identity are they? Folk rock had a lot to say against war and the government, but that is something that has existed it all types of rock. Some could argue that folk rock started that trend, but I\u2019d disagree, even if folk rock never existed rock musicians would still lash out against the hierarchy and military motives. I know the world doesn\u2019t all agree that rock artists are intellectuals, and I\u2019d agree that they aren\u2019t all intelligent, some are pretty air headed tbh. However there are some very intelligent rock musicians out there, who saw what I saw and chose an outlet in which they can influence the world that\u2019s been tainted by government ",
