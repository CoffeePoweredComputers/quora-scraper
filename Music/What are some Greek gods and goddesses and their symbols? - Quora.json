            "answer_text": "The twelve main deities of ancient Greece were the Olympians (the gods that live on Olympus), although if you asked different people in different areas of ancient Greece they would give you a different list of 12 (these are known as dodekatheoi). If you asked an Athenian around the 5th century they would probably give you this list;Zeus- King of the Gods (symbol= thunder, eagle, scepter)Hera- Queen of the Gods (symbol= peacock)Aphrodite- goddess of love (usually always depicted as nude, although some areas covered her up a bit)Demeter- goddess of the harvest (symbol= wheat)Apollo- god of the sun and music (symbol= lyre or bow)Artemis- goddess of the hunt (symbol= bow or stag)Athena- goddess of wisdom (symbol= an owl or the aegis) Ares- god of war (usually depicted with a hoplite panapoly)Hermes- Messenger of the gods (symbol= Scepter entwined with snakes and winged sandals)Hephaestus- God of craftsmen (usually depicted as a lame blacksmith)Dionysos- God of Wine (so many symbols, to name just a few; grape vines, satyrs, jaguars, and very heavily associated with the phallus)Hestia- Goddess of the hearth  Like I said this list would vary greatly in different areas of Greece; for example Dionysos was often left out, whereas in Macedon he was integral. Often gods like Hades are left out because technically he wasn't Olympian. Hope this helps. ",
