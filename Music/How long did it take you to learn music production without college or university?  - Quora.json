            "answer_text": "I studied music production at College and University in the UK. While the College education was excellent because of its focus on music production, Unversity was a waste of time. Even more so when you factor in the ~30K you pay. I can't speak for all Universities, but from my experience, they're severely outdated and have no inclination of what's going on inside the industry. The best lecturers I had all worked within music outside of their main/part-time gig teaching. YouTube is an invaluable resource, but do your research on the YouTuber before you follow their advice. Ultimately, you'll learn the most from experimenting in your DAW. No amount of tutorial watching will provide the same level of education. I studied music production starting at 14, well, I stay studied, but it was purely experimenting with the software. Upon enrolling in College at 16, I was producing decent music, although not professional grade. I was 18 when I had my first release on an indie label in 2012. For me, it took four years to achieve a label release\u2014the first 2 years unguided, the second 2 in education. While I wouldn't credit being in education with little more than filling the gaps in my knowledge. The most valuable aspect it provides is like-minded peers. You'll learn more from those around you than any lecturer. If you can find a way of simulating this, it'll half (in time) you're learning curve. ",
