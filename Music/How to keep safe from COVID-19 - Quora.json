            "answer_text": "The number one way is stay at home, and comply with \u201cSocial Distancing\u201d. Social Distancing is defined as maintaining a 6 foot, or 2 meter distance, between yourself and any other person your do not know. NOTE: NEW important information has confirmed that 6 foot social distancing is only effective for Outside. When indoors, it is possible that the Corona Virus can be spread up to 16 feet, when someone who is positive with the Virus coughs, (and is not wearing a mask). This puts even more emphasis on wearing a mask whenever in an indoor environment. But what does this mean? It does not mean that you can\u2019t go out doors. But if you do go out doors, don\u2019t congregate with others. Stay in your own yard, court yard, or balcony. Don\u2019t go out and meet a group for swimming, tennis, or softball, for instance. Now is not the time to take advantage of those cheap travel tickets! Precautions mostly depends on where you live. Do you live in a City, Suburb, or the Country? If your family lives in the City where people live very close together, then you have your work cut out for you. Wear face masks or nose and mouth coverings when leaving home. Also consider wearing gloves, disposable if you have them, or gloves that can be disinfected upon returning home, (cloth or knit gloves can be washed). If possible, order food and supplies to be delivered, so not one of you has to go out at all! Many companies are waiving delivery fees now. If you must go out for supplies, use antiseptic wipes on grocery carts, and anything else you must touch touch in the store, (such as the self check out, or ATM), and wash your hands immediately upon returning home, before unpacking any food. NOTE: There is currently no evidence that the COVID-19 Virus can be spread in food. If you have pets that need to be walked, walk them very early, or very late, and avoid meeting others. Stay to yourself. NOTE: Domestic Cats are susceptible to the COVID virus so do NOT let your pet cat out of the house! If you live in the Suburbs, there may be some room between you and your neighbors, but the same rules apply. Now is not the time to arrange neighborhood get togethers, or block parties. NO Easter Egg hunts! If you live in the Country, you may already be separated from your neighbors, so Social Distancing may not be so difficult for you. On the other hand, people in the Country tend to rely on neighbors even more! Take care to use the phone or the internet to stay in touch instead on the usual \u201cPop over\u201d or face to face greeting. So, to review: Social Distance means isolating yourself and your family, at least for the time being. This is thought to slow the virus from spreading. A safe distance between people is thought to be 6 feet, or 2 meters.Order food and supplies to be delivered, if delivery is available in your area. Don\u2019t forget to tip the delivery person.If you must go out for food and supplies, cover your mouth and nose, to prevent inhaling the virus. Also wear gloves to cover your hands, and immediately wash hands upon returning home. This is advice from the CDC.For up to information go to CDC Works 24/7 ",

            "answer_text": "WEAR A MASK and STAY 6 FEET FROM OTHER PEOPLE. It really works. Essential workers, like grocery employees for example, have never stopped working, and they come in contact with everyone. Ever since grocery stores implemented mask wearing, they have kept their employees and customers safe. Infection is through respiratory transmission by droplets bigger than aerosols that are generated by coughing, sneezing, and talking but fortunately drop quickly from the air within about 2 metres or 6 feet, especially in moist air (Warmer air has more water vapor.) Just like cold viruses and flu viruses, coronaviruses enter your body through the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth. This is why masks are so important for mitigating both the spread and infection of the virus. However, COVID-19 also has airborne capabilities which means tiny droplets called aerosols can waft through the air (especially in colder air which has less moisture because dry air makes particles break up into smaller pieces that can stay aloft for hours or days) and accumulate over time in poorly ventilated venues, such as indoor dining, bars, and churches, and are thus a recipe for disaster. There is no proof, however, that surface contamination is a major factor. So, stay 6 feet from other people, wear a mask, and stay away from poorly ventilated venues, crowded rooms, and densely populated areas such as New York and New Jersey if at all possible. They have almost twice the population density as anywhere else. Anyone living in these two places should take extra precautions. Hospitals and nursing homes are also highly contagious areas especially if they are not prepared for pandemics. [Update, June 2, 40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the US were in nursing homes, and they contain only 2.4 million residents, a very small percentage of the US population. June 16, It\u2019s not common to contract Covid-19 from a contaminated surface, scientists say. And encounters with people outdoors are unlikely to spread the coronavirus. Instead, the major culprit is close-up, person-to-person interactions for extended periods with people indoors. Crowed indoor events and places where people are talking loudly, or singing, maximize the risk. August 7, More than 40% of those who have died in California where older than 80. August 8, Essential workers, such as Grocery store workers who have largely gone unnoticed, have worked the whole time during the pandemic, feeding every American citizen, and yet no high infection rate among workers. Vons, for instance, did an exceptional job of protecting its employees and customers from the very beginning. The data is hard to come by because journalists and the media don\u2019t want to cover it, but with over 30,000 employees hardly a blip. Masks really do work well to stop the spread of this virus]. But why the slow start to mask wearing? In the 1918 flu pandemic, not wearing a mask was illegal in some parts of America. What changed? When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Asia, people across the region were quick to wear masks. But in the West, mask adoption was far slower, with Dr. Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, for example, going so far as to claim \u201cThere is no reason to be walking around with a mask\u201d, and England\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty echoed that sentiment. The American CDC and WHO also, initially, said it was unnecessary. Yet it hasn\u2019t always been the case that mask wearing is an Asian proclivity. It certainly wasn\u2019t during the influenza pandemic of 1918, which lasted from January 1918 to December 1920. It was the US that led the world in mask wearing. After San Francisco made masks mandatory in public (10/24/1918), an awareness campaign followed which included slogans and songs, including one ditty that had the lyrics: \u201cObey the laws, and wear the gauze. Protect your jaws from septic paws\u201d. The campaign worked and other cities and states followed suit. And it wasn\u2019t just America, in early November 1918, Paris, France and Manchester, England also adopted the policy. But with short supplies of masks, home production was the answer. In parts of America, churches, community groups, and Red Cross chapters came together, acquiring as much gauze as they could find, and held mass mask-making sessions. So, why the slow start to mask wearing? Because no one wanted to compare it to the flu since they wanted to say it was far more contagious. It\u2019s not, though it\u2019s more serious and fatal for some age groups. I know because readers had this answer deleted for awhile because I was doing exactly that. However, both viruses, influenza and coronavirus, are highly infectious diseases with similar symptoms, transmission, and prevention methods. Thus we should have learned from history an adopted this policy from day one. Vitamin C and particularly vitamin D deficiencies may often be the reason seemingly healthy people get infected or are unable to fight the infection off. Healthy blood levels of vitamin D may give people with COVID-19 a survival advantage by helping them avoid cytokine storm, when the immune system overreacts and attacks your own body\u2019s cells and tissues. Vitamin D doesn\u2019t suppress the immune system, it modulates it. Vitamin D makes the immune cells less inflammatory. Low levels of vitamin D are also associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as viral and bacterial respiratory infections. What\u2019s more, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to decreased lung function, which may affect your body\u2019s ability to fight respiratory infections. So, make sure your getting enough vitamin C, such as one glass of orange juice a day, and getting enough sunlight, the main natural source of vitamin D production. Our bodies produce it because only a few foods, such as the flesh of fatty fish, naturally contain significant amounts of vitamin D. Thus, in the US and other countries, cow\u2019s milk and plant-derived milk substitutes are fortified with vitamin D, as are many breakfast cereals. In addition, because of COVID-19\u2019s airborne capabilities, how do we make our indoor buildings safer? There is one solution that is efficient, easily deployable, and economically affordable: virus inactivation by ultraviolet light. By irradiating this type of light inside the ventilation systems of buildings and in shared indoor spaces while not in use, it is possible to quickly and efficiently deactivate airborne and surface-deposited SARS- COV-2 viruses. The current available UV-C sources are fluorescent lamps, microactivity plasmas, and LEDs. To fight tuberculosis\u2019s aerosol capabilities in the early 20th century, there was the open-air school movement that started in Germany in 1904 and then spread throughout Europe and then later in America up until the mid-1940s. The open-air dilutes aerosols making them less contagious, both bacteria and coronavirus aerosols. Though it\u2019s very similar to the flu, unlike the flu in a positive way, those 4 and under are not highly vulnerable. However, like the flu, for those 65 and older with health conditions (85% have 1 chronic condition and 80% have 2 or more), they are highly vulnerable, and just like the flu, it may cause fever, pneumonia, as well as difficulty breathing and require hospitalization for ICU care, or ventilator support. The major difference is that healthcare workers can get a vaccine before the flu season, but healthcare workers can\u2019t get one for the coronavirus and have to rely on N95 respirator masks, goggles, and suits. Since it\u2019s so similar to the flu, it was, at first, easily overlooked by the staffs of hospitals and nursing homes until a sudden outbreak occurred. Now that we know it\u2019s probably not the flu but the coronavirus, we are preempting outbreaks. The reason this virus is overwhelming many hospitals, however, is likely more supply related than virus related since it\u2019s so similar to the flu. So, our medical institutions can handle it. However, the fight against the coronavirus pandemic is being hindered by serious global shortages of face masks and ventilators. WHO said there are delays of four to six months in supply. \u201cThe world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment (PPE). Demand is up 100 times more than normal, and prices are 20 times higher\u201d. In addition, there is a global shortage of ventilators (ICU beds). In the US, we have 62,000 and the federal government has another 8,900 thousand in storage, and a lot of the ones in hospitals are already being used by flu patients. So, once we start mass producing PPEs, we will be able to contain it better. Another reason this virus is overwhelming hospitals is because healthcare workers are getting infected by their patients and are having to be quarantined, thus a shortage of healthcare workers. In Wuhan, China, 41% of the first cases were infected at the hospital, mostly healthcare workers (over 2,000 by March), and in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, 10% of medical workers were infected at the hospital. In the case of SARS, another type of coronavirus, a large amount of infections also originated in hospitals among healthcare workers treating infected people. And healthcare workers are spreading it, cross-contamination, as they move from room to room. In Seattle, Washington, infected nursing home staff were even spreading it to other nursing homes. So now, doctors follow the same strict precautions and wear gloves, N95 respirator masks, and goggles to reduce the likelihood of infection and transference. As of March, everyone in America is saying \u201ca vaccine is 12 to 18 months away\u201d, but countries like China and Germany are capable of doing it in half that amount of time. In the US, Moderna, a biotech company, and Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company are also capable of making one quickly. So, expect one by the end of the year, and we will probably eventually have multiple vaccines to choose from. [Update, July 22, Pfizer and the German biotech firm BioNTech get 1.95 billion COVID-19 vaccine order from the US government. The agreement comes on top of the government\u2019s contracts with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and with the Maryland biotech firm Novavax]. There is, however, some good news for parents because of C0VID\u2019s age discrimination: Children are not succumbing to the virus. So far, there have been no deaths among children ages 0\u20139, and they often don\u2019t need hospitalization. Teenagers are also relatively safe, only 1 teen died in China. However, everyone is vulnerable, it\u2019s just that there are different degrees of vulnerability. The youngest case, a 10 year old, traveled to Wuhan, China with his family. When they returned to Shenzhen, the entire family, ranging from ages 36 to 66, displayed symptoms like a sore throat, fever, diarrhea, and pneumonia. The child, however, had signs of viral pneumonia in his lungs, but otherwise displayed no symptoms. In the cases of previous coronavirus outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), the pattern was similar - no children died during the outbreaks and deaths tended to occur within the age group of 45 and older. Children under the age of 12 displayed minimal symptoms and were much less likely to be admitted to the hospital, according to news reports. The China Center for Disease Control reported, based on data from all 72,314 of those diagnosed with COVID-19 as of February 11, that only 0.9% of cases were 9 or younger, 1% were teens, and 8.1% were in their 20s. In the US, the youngest age group, 19 and under, also accounted for less than 1% of the hospitalizations, and none of the ICU admissions and deaths (CDC). Of 746 children who had close contact with diagnosed patient, or had family members with the disease, only 10 tested positive for COVID-19, and none had symptoms commonly seen in adults, according to a study published March 13 (Business Insider). The death toll skews the old even more strongly. Overall, China CDC found, 2.3% of confirmed cases died. But the fatality rate was 14.8% in people 80 or over, likely reflecting the prescene of other diseases, a weaker immune system, or simply worse overall health. By contrast, the fatality rate was 1.3% for 50-somethings, 0.4% in 40-something\u2019s, 0.2% in people 10 to 39. Most of the cases are mild (81%). According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, the median age of coronavirus-related deaths is 75. [Update, August 15, The American CDC said that the median age for COVID-19 deaths is 78]. Essentially, infants, children, and teens are a lot less vulnerable to the coronaviruses than those 65 an older. This is important to know when trying to pinpoint where the potential outbreaks may occur. In Italy, the second epicenter for coronavirus infections, the majority of the victims, according to Italian health authorities, are more than 80 years old with underlying health problems. And Donatien Alphonse Francois reported that 98.8% of the deaths in Italy are among the 55+ crowd, and 2/3 of those that died and were above 65 had on average 3 comordibities (see his comments below). So, to say that the population is equally effected could hinder us from seeing that there are people who are more vulnerable to the coronavirus, the elderly among us in nursing homes and in senior living communities, especially those who have respiratory problems and other chronic conditions, and it could hinder us from making sure they get the proper medical treatment they need and from providing food and every day essentials to those who are self-isolated at home. (Those 65 and older with chronic conditions should not go out. They need to be self-isolated at home.) Some stores, are opening an hour early for the elderly. And personally, young or old, be self-isolated at home yourself if infected and only have mild symptoms since hospitals are already overwhelmed with coronavirus patients and since there are lots of other pathogens there. It\u2019s highly contagious in hospitals because of all the infected patients there during an epidemic or pandemic. For instance, of 138 patients infected with the coronavirus and admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, 41% appear to have been infected at the hospital. They include 40 health care workers and 17 patients already admitted for other conditions, a toxic mix - ill health, a virus, and old age. Hospitals may also want to isolate those infected into different buildings, makeshift tents, trailers, homes, or different locations. So, don\u2019t rush to the ER, call first, and they will direct you where to go, such as a clinic, triage, hospital, or even to go online, especially for those seeking information or for fulling your prescriptions for other health conditions. Now is also a good time to talk about the flu since they are so similar. The CDC estimates that in the US alone, from October 1, 2019, through February 29, 2020, there have been: 34 million to 49 million flu illnesses 16 million to 23 million flu medical visits 350,000 to 620,000 flu hospitalizations 20,000 to 50,000 flu deaths (Historically, 90% are 65 or older, [80,000 in 2017\u20132018 season] So far this season, 105 children have died from the flu, according to data released Friday (Feb. 14) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the highest number of child flu deaths at this point in the season since the CDC started keeping records in 2004, except for the 2009 flu Pandemic. So, GET YOUR FLU SHOTS at the beginning of each flu season. If your 65 or over, it\u2019s one of the most important life insurance policies you can make. Influenza activity often begins to increase in October, and peaks between December and February, although activity can last as late as May. ",
