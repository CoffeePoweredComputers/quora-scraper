            "answer_text": "Question: \u201cAs a singer, can I get a free producer?\u201d Answer: My, you must think pretty highly of yourself and your talent to think someone would go to the trouble of producing a song for you for free. I have been producing music daily for a number of years now, can tell you that for the (roughly 3-5 minutes) you spend enjoying a tune on the radio, a producer somewhere invested 10 - 40+ hours of their time to design the sounds, compose a piece, arrange everything both horizontally and vertically, mix the arrangement, and finally master it for distribution. Oh, and that's all IN ADDITION to having to meet the demands of the vocalist or other artist you're working with. Bear in mind, when I give you that seemingly simple list of things that need to happen, know that each is a very nuanced art all on its own and there are people that spend a lifetime mastering any one of them. A producer wears many hats, it is a skill set not easily learned, one that's difficult to get good at, and it takes a literal lifetime to master. It is truly a multidisciplinary art that requires an unbelievably passionate individual to succeed at. The amount of knowledge a producer has about how sounds are formed and how you as a human hear and interpret those sounds would probably blow your mind. And I don't mean, \u2018humans have ears that hear\u2019. I mean how the sound reaches and enters the ear, and the psychoacoustic science behind how your brain interprets that raw audio data as something meaningful. Music/audio production happens at the crossroads of the right and left brain and requires a person that's spent time training both. A juxtaposition of art and science. These people are very smart and they aren't called audio \u201cengineers\u201d for nothing. I know this doesn't directly answer your question, but hopefully it puts your ask into perspective for you. Producing (good*) music takes an unbelievable amount of skill, talent, and daily practice. To ask someone to do this for free would be to tell that person (that dedicated their life to learning all of that), \u201cHey, I respect you and your talent enough to ask you to do this for me, but not enough to pay you for it. Please, use your art and talent to showcase MY talent and ability so I can get paid for \u201cmy\u201d hit song.\u201d Yea, good luck with that. ",

            "answer_text": "No way!Unless they are asking you to sing on a track FOR THEM. A lot goes into producing and it\u2019s pretty unfair to ask that much of a person without it benefiting them in some way. If you are both new and want to practice composing a song together that is a different story especially if you\u2019re close friends. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone to agree with that \u2018deal\u2019You could always find royalty-free music to sing over for a small fee or find one that only requires attribution, but I\u2019d double check on whatever policies come along with that.

As a producer i know that there\u2019s tons of producers out there willing to work with you. It could be because your talented or because of your unique voice, but most of the times it\u2019s because producers have tons of music(instrumental) but cannot release without vocals in it or cannot afford to pay for a singer. You might have to dig deep or prolly not cause with all the social media and stuff but anyways, goodluck! ",
