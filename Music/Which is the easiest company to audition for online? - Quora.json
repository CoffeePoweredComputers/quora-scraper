            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say the smaller companies are a lot easier to get into than the top 3 companines in korea. reason being is that since they are a smaller company they don\u2019t have such high standards as the other bigger companies do, however if you are gunna audition I\u2019d suggest you to audition for the big 3 companies first before auditioning for a smaller one because when u debut you probably won\u2019t be well known or might even end up disbanding if you are at a smaller company that not manage artist debut in or know things about the company. opposite things happen when you go to bigger companies like SM,YG,JYP,CUBE,PLEDIS,FNC etc\u2026 ",
