            "answer_text": "You should buy a Bts albums you like the most. I would suggest picking an album that has a tracklist with the most songs you like if you have a CD player and will be using it. If you do not own one or will not be playing it I suggest buying one with the prettiest design and photos in it or with a photo card option you like. You can also buy an album by seeing which one cost the best for your budget or by how much sentimental value one of the eras/albums has to you. ",
