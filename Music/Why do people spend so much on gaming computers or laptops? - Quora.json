            "answer_text": "Some people pay a fortune for football season tickets, others spend thousands on their cars, others would think nothing of going out every weekend and spending their money that way.  A friend of mine has just spent the best part of \u00a35K for a mountain bike which isn't the best he could get but that's all he wanted to spend, and the bike will do what he wants to do.  Add on the accessories for this and it works out to be a serious amount of money that he has spent on his hobby.  That said, he reckons his mountain bike will probably last him a few years, so the cost of ownership of that bike on a per week basis easily compares with the cost of other hobbies. Computer gaming is a hobby, like any other, and while compared to buying a PS4 the cost of computer components can be more expensive, a PC is infinitely more flexible and can be much more easily upgraded which is better from a cash perspective rather than having to buy a new console every couple of years. Compare the cost of ownership to other hobbies, and the amount of hours usage that a gaming PC can get (and Steam conveniently calculates this for you) and you can work out how much a PC actually costs per hour.  Looking at it this way, PC gaming is not so expensive after all. ",
