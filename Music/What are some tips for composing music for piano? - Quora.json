            "answer_text": "You can educate yourself in performance (being able to play what you hear in your mind, so you can lay it down on the page) and in \u201ctheory\u201d (modes, scales, traditional ways of organizing tones) - but NO ONE knows exactly how you compose piano music, or any other kind of music. But I could give you some \u201chandy hints\u201d: Write lots and lots. A few minutes ago I wrote a silly thing for marimba and bassoon, which I doubt anyone will ever hear. But I enjoyed writing it, and it did sharpen my ear for certain progressions of sound.Never let the writing become a chore, or something you anxiously \u201chave to do.\u201d I\u2019m 69. Within 20 years or so, I shall die, and while I have written many very good pieces, my manuscripts will end up in a cardboard box or on various thumb drives, or in the Sound Cloud, and a few good folks might hear them, or they might not. But I have been privileged to have composed music, and I was happy, and brought joy to others for awhile on this lonely earth.Originality is something of an illusion. DO delve deep into your soul for melodies - don\u2019t be afraid to write and rewrite and come up with something that is really \u201cYOU\u201d - but then remember that all forms of expression and communication deal heavily in forms and ideas and cliches and expressions learned from Others. Composing involves rearranging, in your mind, lots of stuff you\u2019ve heard, and coming out with your own concept. 30 kids get a lot of crayons and paper and draw a cat. Every cat is unique, and every kid can rightly be proud of his cat; now, maybe one kid will draw a lot of lines no one can fathom, and he tells the teacher, \u201cI am too original to draw cats. This is an abstract rendering of gestalt, using crayons to achieve something beyond crayons.\u201d Well and good for him, though his parents may end up confused or sad.Sometimes use a simple established form - a waltz, a polka, a march - that gives you good, straight borders for your creation.Or, just start out putting one note after another and see how they work out. Your own natural organizing ability will turn them into music.If you write a song with words, make the notes the servants of the words, not the other way around. Poetry often seems to have a song \u201cwithin it\u201d, waiting to be released. Try turning prose words into poetry, then writing a song.The craft of writing music is a lifelong thing. Two years. Okay, how good at writing words were you at two years\u2019 experience? \u201cSee Spot run. Look! There is a truck and a car. The truck ran over Spot. Oh, no.\u201d and so on. Good things take time. Music writing is incredibly time-free. You can start a piece in 2017 and finish it in 2028. Bach probably never had his B Minor Mass probably his greatest work, performed in his lifetime; but it was worth the writing - well worth it.",

            "answer_text": "The first thing I have to ask is: Do you want to compose Classical Music or just any music for piano? There reason is that classical music has a lot of rules and forms while just plain music is whatever you want. I will give you a few tips (that I use) in general that work for both: The first thing is to find a theme, there is no use finding all the key signatures and time signatures and all that, if there is nothing to play, the theme is what you decide it can be complex or easy.Second find your form (key signatures and time signatures) this require some tweaking of the melody but it shouldn't be a problem if you've got that.Left hand, in most pieces the left is under used or is just an accompaniment, though this is not necessarily wrong it does leave a lot to be desired and is usually for me the hardest part, it is best to use the note from the right hand is the left hand chord or whatever you use for some cohesion between the two.If you're composing a classical pieces it is at this time that I usually follow all the rules and fit my piece into the rulebook, so to speak.Write is down fast, because no matter what you do if you don't write down you're price first, you will keep changing it until you do, better to write first and think later.Basic concepts of theory are very useful, mainly grouping and time signature.If you're going old school pen and paper you may need someone to check you're work. If you're using a software then although can be theoretically correct, the sound and feel might be off.just sitting at the piano and playing a few notes here and there will help a lot. The best way for me is to play a piece like Fur Elize (or Elise) then when I get to the end find out what the next bar could be, sort of continuing to compose an already finished.I know that my answer might not be as helpful as I would like, but give it a go and who knows what might happen.
