            "answer_text": "Elvis began by acknowledging that many people believed that he had written \u201cYou Gave Me A Mountain\u201d from a personal place and that it somehow reflected his relationship with Priscilla. At this point, the singer pointed out that Priscilla was attending the concert and called on her to stand \u201cShe\u2019s right here\u2026please stand up,\u201d Elvis says to Priscilla. \u201cBoy, she\u2019s a beautiful chick. I\u2019ll tell you for sure, boy. I know it when I pick \u2019em.\u201d The audience elicited a few whoops and whistles as he showed off and admired his ex-wife. Next, he introduced his six-year-old daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who jumped up to wave to the audience. At this, Elvis scolds her for not pulling her dress down before she jumped up excitedly. \u201cAnd then at the same booth is my girlfriend, Sheila. Stand up, Sheila,\u201d He says into the microphone. \u201cTurn around, completely around. Sheila, hold that ring up!\u201d His girlfriend holds up the huge ring Elvis had given her at his request This is where things start to get juicy. Elvis began to pull all these bits and pieces together \u2013 especially why his ex-wife, daughter, and and girlfriend were all sharing the same booth. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m trying to get across,\u201d he began. \u201cWe\u2019re the very best of friends and we always have been. Our divorce came about not because of another man, or another woman, but because of the circumstances involving my career.\u201d \u201cI was traveling too much, I was gone too much and it was just an agreement. I didn\u2019t think it was fair to her, that I was gone too much. \u201cWe just made an agreement to always be friends and be close and care because we have a daughter to raise.\u201d The fact that they remained close friends proves that they remained good friends! So i think he did get over her, they accepted they didnt work and for the kids sake ! Best wishes \u2763 ",

Infidelity had a lot to do with it. Being on tour, distanced them, and \u201con tour\u201d there were too many temptations for a guy like Elvis! ",
