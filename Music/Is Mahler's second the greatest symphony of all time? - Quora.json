            "answer_text": "I personally find Mahler\u2019s second symphony without parallel, it is magnificent yet simple for anyone to understand and appreciate its beauty. There are certainly other great symphonies around but there is no denying that some of them are quite difficult for non-classical music enthusiastic to comprehend how great they are. Whereas Mahler\u2019s 2nd Symphony is so powerful and spectacular in such apparent ways that anyone who loves music will be able to appreciate it. 1812 and Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony intrigued my interest in classical music but Mahler\u2019s 2nd is the piece that stunned me, left me crying uncontrollably with joy which I can\u2019t even use words to describe. I have never felt so happy and calm at the same time in my life! So for me personally, I say yes. Yes, Mahler\u2019s second is the greatest symphony of all time. ",

            "answer_text": "I like Ross Driedger\u2019s observation. I would observe that It\u2019s hard to choose which of Mahler\u2019s symphonies is the best. Numbers 2, 3, 5, 9 and the symphony called Das Lied von Der Erde are all great. I admire the movement of #2 called Totenfeier a lot, and marvel at the score whilst listening to that movement. Who can resist the Adagietto of the 5th? And the final movement of the 9th remains for me one of my absolute favorites. And who can forget Der Abschied from Das Lied von Der Erde? It\u2019s all good stuff. I won\u2019t argue with anyone who says they prefer this one or that. I will think it\u2019s a bit irrational to declare the 2nd the \u201cbest\u201d because Mahler\u2019s best work is not in competition with itself. If you like it, you want all of it. ",
