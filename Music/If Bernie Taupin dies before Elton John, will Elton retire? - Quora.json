            "answer_text": "It has been widely reported that his current tour is to be his last. After half a century of writing and performing on stage, at age 73 with two small sons (Zachary and Elijah) at home, nearing (if not already at) school age, as well as being the CEO of the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which is hugely successful in the prevention and treatment of people with HIV/AIDS, it is no surprise that Sir Elton has announced this tour to be his last. He has not said it will be his last performance, but as far as anything in a concert-type setting, he\u2019s pretty much conceded that it will be. The tour, which says as much with it\u2019s title \u201cFarewell Yellow Brick Road\u201d has at this writing been postponed due to the restrictions posed by the Corona virus, but Sir Elton promises to be back at it \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d He has added so many shows to this last tour that his deep regret of the need to stop touring is obvious, and it seems he will miss his audiences even as much as they shall miss him. He remains the fifth highest paid entertainer in history and will share his retirement with, besides his sons, husband David Furnish. ",

I can\u2019t physically do the traveling anymore. I want to be at home. I really want to spend time with my children at home. I\u2019ve had an incredible life, but life is all about change.\u201d It is a lengthy farewell, though, as the tour was scheduled to have over 300 dates. ",
