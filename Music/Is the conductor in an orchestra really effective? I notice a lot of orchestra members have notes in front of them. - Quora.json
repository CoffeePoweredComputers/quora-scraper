            "answer_text": "The condictor can be very effective in rehearsing an orchestra if they are not professionals. A conductor also attracts the attention of the audience. Conductors sell tickets and people come to concerts to watch them. But the musicians in a professional orhestra can play without a conductor - and you might not evrsen notice the difference if you had your eyes closed. It actually looks as if the reason those people are playing those notes is because someone is pointing at them and waving his/her arms. It\u2019s supposed to look like that. This way the cult of the celebrity conductor thrives. But in reality, yes, the players are reading music and not even glancing up at the conductor. Some players are facing the conductor and have long periods of rest, and can watch the conductor. Others play all the time and are not facing the conductor. They stay together just as well. Check out the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra on You Tube - no conductor, ever. ",

            "answer_text": "LOL! A lot?? Try 100%. OK so you think it can be done without a conductor. WHO sets the tempo (speed). Who decides how long a fermata is held (a suspension of the beat)? Who determines how much silence between movements, who plays what instruments loudly, etc? Whether to honor the written repeats in every case, or perhaps make an exception? What if the horns disagree with the strings, then who wins the debate? What if some think the piece should sound dry as a bone, and others want it to flail around romantically to the point of getting out of control? Who wins? ",
