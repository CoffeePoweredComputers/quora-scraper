            "answer_text": "\u201cMother and Child Reunion\u201d by Paul Simon would make a good getting-pumped kind of song if the lyrics weren\u2019t so relentlessly sad. My impression of the lyrics is of a man whose wife has died finding out his daughter is dying as well; it could also be interpreted as being about a custody battle, but I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with that interpretation for non-artistic reasons. \u201cYou Belong To Me\u201d by Carly Simon has a tune you might want to bump and grind to, but the lyrics are raw, unhinged jealousy without even the sapphic undertones of a similar song like \u201cJolene\u201d, released five years earlier by Dolly Parton. If you look at Carly\u2019s later \u201cBetter Not Tell Her\u201d as a sequel, it\u2019s clear things went even wronger, as the song starts with all-out rage and ends with crying and self-pity. Yeah, Carly\u2019s good at writing emotional whiplash. This sort of dissonance is practically her signature. \u201cLightning Strikes\u201d by Lou Christie is a banger even by modern standards, but the lyrics are about an irredeemable cheating asshole who still expects loyalty from the woman he allegedly loves. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy\u201d by Bobby McFerrin, when it came out, was seen as a humorous and occasionally rather vapid inspirational pep-talk kind of song, but in fact it\u2019s a vicious parody of such music. The lyrics become more grim and nihilistic the more you listen to them, and the narrator by the end is outright guilt tripping you for being unhappy, almost to the point of gaslighting. There\u2019s a reason Robin Williams was in the video. ",

            "answer_text": "Revenge by the Mekons. It features a loose, bouncy sound and a cheerful voice singing: When I got back in town today It felt like I\u2019d never been away And they took me to the place Where your twisted body lay Out by the bins With all the other rubbish You said it ain\u2019t stealing It\u2019s just been thrown away Revenge ain\u2019t so sweet But it\u2019ll have to do Revenge is about as sweet As the way I feel about you OK, \u201csad\u201d might not be the right word to describe it. But these aren\u2019t happy thoughts. ",
