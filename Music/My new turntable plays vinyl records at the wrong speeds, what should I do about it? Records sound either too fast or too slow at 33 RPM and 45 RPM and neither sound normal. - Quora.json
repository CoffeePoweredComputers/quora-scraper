Start a stopwatch and count the times that mark goes around in precisely three minutes (one person counting and a second manning the stopwatch might be easier). If your count is 100, then it\u2019s running at the proper speed. If you get a count that\u2019s much different, contact the seller. Or check the user manual for the \u2018table; some are adjustable on purpose. ",
