            "answer_text": "Yeah I recommend what the other guy mentioned. Learn how to break any song apart and understand then replicate the drumming. This can be really fun if it's your favourite album. I did this with blink182, sum41, iron maiden and redhotchillipeppers. Once you can play a couple songs off their albums and you have a good ear for music you will be able to improvise and play along to band members guitars & bass. One thing you will need to know is that when you learn a drumbeat start REALLY slow. Slower olay it faster and faster as your brain shifts it into long term reflex motor control. You'll even nptoce that after having a sleep that the drumbeat you were struggling with is all of a sudden mpre fluid, this demonstrates the power of how the brain reorganizes information it learns when you sleep and refines it.

            "answer_text": "Have you tried youtube? There's everything on Youtube.Anyways, whether you play electronic or acoustic, probably the best way to improve your skills is to listen to better drummers than yourself, via albums, online, ipod, live if possible, whatever. I used to sit at the kit for hours listening to my stereo at full volume and just trying to replicate what I heard until I got it, and then moved up to more complicated and more difficult things slowly but surely.
