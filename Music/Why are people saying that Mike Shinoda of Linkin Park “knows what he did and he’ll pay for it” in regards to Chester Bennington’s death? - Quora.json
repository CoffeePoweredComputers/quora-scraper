            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t been much active on social media, but I think I know the story behind this. First, let me tell you a little back-story.  In 1996, three high school friends, Mike Shinoda, Bradford Delson and Rob Bourden, came together to create a band called Xero, along with Dave Farrell, Joe Hahn and Mark Wakefield. The band, alas, did not gain much prominence and Mark Wakefield left the band. Now, searching for a replacement, they recruited a vocalist from Arizona named Chester Bennington, who replaced Mike as the band\u2019s front-man when they changed their name to Hybrid Theory and later to Linkin Park in 2000.  Now fast forward to 20th July 2017. After a widely successful career and a huge cult following, Chester Bennington committed suicide in his Paolos Verdes Estates home in California. A known patient of depression, he took his life by hanging. Merely 2\u20133 days later, the Twitter account of his wife, Talinda Bennington, released a statement saying that she was cheating on him with fellow-bandmate Mike and that she never loved him, just his money.   While the account was proven to be hacked, this refueled a rumour from long back that Mike was not happy with Chester having taken his place as the lead in the band and held a grudge against him. People also believed that Mike knew about his depression, yet never did anything to cure it. What I would like to say is that fans have been so blinded by Chester, that they ignored the amazing chemistry he and Mike had, both on-stage and off-stage. This is all just rumours and Mike had nothing to do with it. Peace Out! ",

            "answer_text": "Yea any real fan would not believe this utter bs, chester and mike had an amazing friendship just look it up, chester even tweeted about this in 2014, and people also think this because mike didnt cry or get really emotional after chesters death they thought he did not care about chester but this is not true because people have different ways of dealing with the loss of a close freind or family memeber, his way was making songs and you can hear and see his pain in the lyrics, But chesters sister\u2019s story i think is utter bs the evidence is there mike and chester were like brothers, but in my opinion i think shes just trying to stir up controversy because her brothers band became successful and she was jealous, i mean come on really \u201c i was having panic attacks\u201d you was having panic attacks cause people were mentioning your brothers name along with one of his friends? jeez get a grip woman ",
