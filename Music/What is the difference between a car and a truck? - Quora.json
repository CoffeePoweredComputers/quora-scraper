            "answer_text": "Most people in the industry will draw the line between trucks and cars at the technical difference in their frame design. For trucks, they use what is called body on frame, or a ladder frame chassis, which are heavier, more rigid and durable frames that allow them to tow and haul heavier loads without deforming. These frames are used for pickups and large SUVs, and people will commonly call both classes of these vehicles \u201ctrucks\u201d because of the frame that is common between them, which is meant for a pickup truck, but also used on the same platform for full sized SUVs. Cars commonly use what is called a unibody design, or sometimes called a monocoque design (which is not technically correct but still used). This type of chassis uses body panels of the car along with the structural components of the car like the A, B, and C pillars and engine bay, etc, as the structure for the car. This allows car makers to build the car smaller since the body of the car itself is the frame, and not a separate body atop a frame. This is lighter weight, but is also less rigid, and would deform under the same stresses as a ladder frame chassis. This unibody chassis also extends to crossover SUVs, which are built on modified car chassis, and would not be called trucks by the above definition. Only full-sized SUVs (EX. Chevrolet Tahoe, which is built on the same chassis as a Silverado) would be called trucks, not a crossover SUV (EX. Equinox). I hope this was helpful, as understanding the differences in their design is what leads to their differences in application and naming. ",

            "answer_text": "\"What is the difference between a car and a truck?\" A truck is optimized to carry \"stuff\" and a car is optimized to carry \"people.\"Sure, you can get a very fancy truck that has plush resources for passengers, but that doesn't change the main equation. Trucks are typically built on a ladder frame, and do not have the same comfort of the passengers. They are often higher up, so they have better visibility, and are built so that they will tend to be the winner in a crash. They will also be less stable in critical situations than a car, with a much lower center of gravity. Automobiles tend to be more comfortable, with better suspension, better mileage, better safety features (air bags, etc.) and better seating. Automobiles are designed from the ground up to transport people, not things. They are more stable in turns, have better mileage, and are designed from the ground up to transport people. ",
