            "answer_text": "At the age of 75, Mitch Ryder continues to tour and record in the US and Europe. After the Detroit Wheels broke up Mitch Ryder had another band called \u201cDetroit,\u201d which had a hit in 1972 with a great version of Lou Reed\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll.\u201d The kind of success that Mitch Ryder really deserved never materialized. His is revered by the rockers who came after him. Bob Seger was inspired by those early Mitch Rider records. Bruce Springsteen featured a medley of songs by Ryder in his set for a long time. John Fogerty, of Credence Clearwater Revival, was clearly influenced by Mitch Ryder\u2019s singing style. The string of Midwestern rock acts who have admitted to being influenced by Ryder runs the gamut from the MC5 to Ted Nugent to John Mellencamp and more. There were so many hot bands in the sixties playing around Michigan, and most of them played covers of Mitch Ryder songs. He was a Midwestern star and a guiding light to all the young rockers. In the end we can see that Mitch Ryder was highly influential. His authenticity as a soul shout kind of singer with a hot band is unparalleled. After a lifetime of struggle in the music business Ryder has settled in to life as a working musician. He is popular in Europe and seems to play there periodically. ",
