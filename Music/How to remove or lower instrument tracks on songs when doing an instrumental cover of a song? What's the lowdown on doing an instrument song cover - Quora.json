Your approach to making music confuses me, so I'll share how Iook at it, as well as most of the musicians I've known or worked with. When y ou decide to cover a number, you have things in mind about \u201chow I'd do this in my (or my band's) own way.\u201d You're never going to sound just like the original, so you decide to put your stamp on it. If you want a line lower, you can either move it down an octave, or give the impression of a lower register by playing the original line twinned with a lower harmony. But I'm still confused as to why you're covering it before the vision struck you. I think it'd be cool to have a six piece country band do Khatchaturian's Saber Dance. We'd approach each part as something like \u201cOK, the pedal steel needs to do those trombone swoops, because nothing else has that sound. Those piccolo and flute parts, we'll give to the fiddle, and maybe a harmony from the Tele.\u201d And you just keep adapting the preexisting parts to fit what you and your band bring to the table. Don't let Quora write your arrangement, use your ideas; God (or whatever forces you believe in) gave you a brane for your own use. Let it shine. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps you could rephrase your question ? I cant interpret what you are asking , if you mean lower the level of an instrument track \u2014 use the mixer inside the DAW , if you mean lower the level of the instrument plugin , 3each plugin has its own parameters like a mini mixer . Removing a plugin varies from one DAW to another . ",
