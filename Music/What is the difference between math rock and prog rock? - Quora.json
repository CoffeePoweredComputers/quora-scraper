            "answer_text": "I saw a ton of historical and conceptual answers but I feel none really hit the nail in the head when it comes to the differences between both genres. Let me give it a try. First I think it's important to try to understand why people sometimes use the labels interchangeably. In my opinion it has a lot to do with a few emo/math bands (specially TTNG) who became pretty popular in the last decade. Their focus on catchy pop hooks, extreme tapping skills and a pretty dynamic singing (though their first singer was not that good live haha) got them noticed in the prog community, and soon you start to seem bands like Chon (who I struggle to call them math, but whatever) that took TTNG's formula and added a bit more prog influences. Also, the rise of Audiotree Live and the fact the Chon and other similar bands were featured a lot in the early videos of the channel could be considered a contributing factor to the confusion regarding the genre. That being said, and since, contrary to most other people that answered, I'm more familiar to math rock than prog, I'll give you a few opinions regarding the genre that I think you won't find in prog: . Math rock comes from the punk and hardcore community so it can fall under the umbrella of Post-hardcore. Let's no forget that punk came as a response to the early prog and stadium rock bands of the 60's and 70's, so while math rock can be complex, most bands make a somewhat unconscious effort to keep their music unpretentious (which is how most of the punk community views prog). So while some songs might seem complex, most of them can be dissected into very simple parts and stuff like concept albums and grandiose themes are usually avoided. . Despite the trend with the emo/math bands, melody is actually not that big of a focus on math rock. Usually most bands 9focus way more on rhythm. . Looping is a big part of math rock. The genre is at the forefront of creative techniques using looping pedals, most notably the Line6 DL4 witch not only let's you loop your playin, but you can also reverse and retrigger the loop and play it 2x faster or slower. So a lot of math rock songs have this ever evolving jam feeling, where members try to add and take different loops and beats in different time signatures over each other. . Lastly, a lot of math bands are also influenced by noise rock, so you might see some focus on unconventional instrument playing, like distorted saxophones, prepared guitars and so on. Basically, math rock is punk kids trying to make even weirder music. That being said, of course genres evolve and one could argue that this new mix of prog and math might be the logical evolution of it, but I'd try to hold judgment, because from what I've seen, most of those bands have no relation whatsoever to the earlier bands in the genre, and a lot of them don't even consider themselves math. They just play songs with a focus on clean guitar tapping and poly rhythms, which is a tiny bit of what defines math rock. ",

            "answer_text": "Most prog rock focuses on song structures that follow a more restrained approach. Juan de Dios Concha discussed how prog rock added instrumental techniques to the genre, which is absolutely true, but most pieces in the classic prog genre still have a structure that makes sense and which is often pop related. For example, even a piece of music as complex and staggering as Yes\u2019 \u201cClose to the Edge\u201d has an \u2018intro-verse-chorus-bridge-outro\u201d structure, but one that is expanded and varied in different ways. And while this isn\u2019t 100 percent true of every type of prog band or composition, it is true enough in general. Math rock, by comparison, is more complex in many ways. The song structures are based more on classical or even jazz-based ideas but taken to extremes. Structure varies depending on the whim of the composer and the idea of varying time signatures and textures is taken to an extreme. The connection with pop music is tenuous, at best, most of the time. ",
