            "answer_text": "For me, the name of the game is contrast and audience engagement. Build things up, ease them down, in both tempo and volume- and if you can help it, style. Get a good mix of feels- start out fast in the first couple tunes, then go more moderate, then slow it down, bring it up gradually and then finish strong and fast. We can talk all day about stage presence, lyrical context, and musical composition which certainly play roles. But people I think too often forget about how important contrast is. You can\u2019t linger too long on one feel. If you keep it fast and loud, it\u2019ll get at best exhausting, at worst grating. If you keep it too slow and quiet, it becomes boring\u2026 and then you lose the audience. I see it happen all the time. Consider what you can do to always keep the audience\u2019s attention, because once you lose them, it\u2019ll be a major struggle to bring them totally back. Even if you manage to bring some folks back, once a crowd decides they don\u2019t wanna bother with you, they won\u2019t. They probably won\u2019t boo, but you might not get anything more than polite, half-hearted applause. An effective performance gives the audience a reason to keep involved. Engage them, sing TO them, perform TO them. Keep your stage banter light, funny, and brief. Again, momentum, if you talk too much they\u2019ll get antsy. When you consider content, think of what would connect with them the most. If you\u2019re playing covers, pick things everybody enjoys and can sing along to. Even in a set with mainly original songs, a well-placed cover can revitalize a crowd that could be on the brink of losing focus. So always keep a few in your back pocket that you can reference. When you play originals, pick your favorites, pick ones your friends like. Those are the ones you\u2019ll play better because you like them. You always play favorite tunes the best. So think about contrast and keeping the audience engaged. The most effective performances make you feel something, so give them something to feel. And of course, be yourself! ",

            "answer_text": "It would stay with me for a long time after I heard it, perhaps permanently. It would seem as if the first ever performance. There would be a quality of attentiveness quite different from the familiarity that usually comes over when a good player or ensemble plays/sings a work. I would notice a lot of detail in the work performed - that is, more than just the melody, more than just solos. By this, I'm thinking of detail simultaneous with solo or melody. Some examples I remember are a performance of a set of Elgar songs for contralto and orchestra that I heard in the fifties. One of these is \u201cSabbath Morning at Sea.\u201d Those songs haunt me to this day. I never hesrd them again, though I did read the pems. I still hear the richness of the orchestral sound and rhe harmony, the tragedy in the voice. Another is \u201cThe Dream of Gerontius\" also Elgar, sung by the Bach Choir in about 1968. It just had everything I described above. I can hear it still. A few years ago I heard on TV the pianist Emmanuel Ax play the Chopin Prelude in E minor. That too had it all. I know it well, but it seemed like the first performance, and as if he were composing it as he played. I'd never before heard the logic of those harmonies with such clarity. Years before, I'd heard him play the Beethoven 5th Piano Concerto on TV. That had had just the same quality of new creation and intent listening to his own playing. Magic. ",
