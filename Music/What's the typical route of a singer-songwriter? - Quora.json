            "answer_text": "A professional one? I couldn't tell you. But I did spend some years in Austin, TX trying to be. It starts in your bedroom, playing to your cat. Then you dare record a song or three. You finally muster the courage for an open Mic. You suck, and the life-sucking apathy destroys you in a deep place. Save that. It'll come in handy later. You finally open up to the broader songwriting community. Maybe, like me, you'll find a cohort who plays a good lead and can sing harmony. You start talk about where you'll go, and you start getting invites to play at some of the better open mics as a featured act. Then, your partner meets some chick and what had been practicing four or five times a week becomes one. Some of the people who had at once showed you support now harbor a bit of resentment. It's tough to find a new partner when you'd been the dick I was. The job becomes more important, the guitar gathers dust. You pull it out at parties, maybe when you've had a few beers. And you wonder... That's my experience, anyway. To answer the specifics of your question, you should be competent enough to accompany your vocals. Later, either get better, or surround yourself with talented people. They'll make you look and sound so much better. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to be able to play an instrument well enough to write songs and play shows.  I don't mean to sound glib. The days of the songwriter who is just a lyricist are gone (if they were ever here), and there are fewer and fewer ways for singers to get their foot in the door as a singer, since there are so few big recording sessions with hired guns, and so little in the way of artist development at labels.  So go sing and songwrite! Pick up enough guitar or piano to accompany yourself to play out and to record some demos, and then start collaborating as soon as possible. ",
