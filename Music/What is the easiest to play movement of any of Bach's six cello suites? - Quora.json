            "answer_text": "The easiest movement is supposed to be Bourree I from Cello Suite 3 in C major. Most people who play cello have played it before without knowing it, in the form of Suzuki books. If you\u2019re looking for a piece that has relatively little technical difficulty, the Sarabande from Cello Suite No 1 in G major is a nice fit. However, like the prelude before it, it is a drag to play it well musically. A piece that allows you to show off but without too much technical and musical difficulty is the Allemande from the same suite. It should be played in a moderato style and should not be difficult to master. It is (only) grade 7 according to ABRSM. Surprisingly, the Gigue in Cello Suite 5 in C major is rather easy. It\u2019s strange, a relatively easy quick movement in an otherwise demanding piece of repertoire. For musicians who rather loathe quick passages like me, most of the courantes except for the one in suite 6 (which is difficult in itself, but not for its speed) should be avoided until further enlightenment in musicality and technicality is achieved. Otherwise, you\u2019re just going to make a fool of yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "When first introducing/teaching the Bach Suites, I usually start with Suite I Minuets, then Gigue, and work backward through the movements, saving the Prelude for last. The dance movements have a more linear structure that's easier to grasp. The Preludes are more free-form and mood-setting - think 3 minute cadenza. Technically, I'd rank the suites themselves 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6 in order of difficulty. Also, the Suzuki Cello program first introduces Bach Suites in Book 4, toward the end of that book, and only the Minuet movements. ",
