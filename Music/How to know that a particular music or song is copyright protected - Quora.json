            "answer_text": "Under the international Berne Convention, all musical works are granted copyright protection as soon as they are fixed in a tangible medium. In other words, once a composer puts to paper or records a musical work, it is automatically protected by copyright for a period of time. In the United States, all works published before 1923 are in the public domain; that is, their copyright protection period has expired. Works published after 1922, but before 1978 are protected for 95 years from the date of publication. If the work was created, but not published, before 1978, the copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. ",
