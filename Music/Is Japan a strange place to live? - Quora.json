            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s a pleasant place to be and the strangeness adds character to it. That being said, Japan isn\u2019t really all that strange. I would even say that life in Japan is relatively boring and predictable. Perhaps the uniformity of the Japanese people might be the weirdest thing about Japan. Other than that, it\u2019s a stable country with its own quirks like any other nation. ",
