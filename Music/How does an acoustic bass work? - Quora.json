            "answer_text": "How does an acoustic bass work? If you are talking about a stand-up bass, it\u2019s mechanism is a little bit different than a guitar. A fat string is stretched between two points, the nut and the bridge. Beneath the string in a fingerboard against which the string can be pressed in different places to change the length of the section from finger stop to the bridge. When the string is plucked or excited by dragging a bow across it it will vibrate. The vibrations of the string where it goes across the bridge are transmitted to the top of the instrument, which is a hollow box of wood. On a guitar or small \u201cacoustic bass guitar\u201d the bridge is glued to the top (\u201cbelly\u201d) of the instrument. However, on a stand-up acoustic bass it borrows a technique used on violin family instruments; the sound-post. The sound-post is a wooden dowel that is placed between the belly and the back of the hollow wood box, held in by friction. The end under the belly is not exactly under the bridge. The sound post does give some support to the belly, but it also acts as a fulcrum (the pivot point of a lever) and transmits the small movements of the bridge vibrating the belly to more of the wood on the front side (also some through the post to the back). If you remember levers from middle school science class, if one side is short (distance from the bridge to the sound-post) and the other is long, the lever increases the travel on the longer side. So proper placement of the sound-post increases the amplitude of the vibrations of the front surface to move more air and make a louder sound. I have stroked my stand-up bass with a bow and felt the sound build up and fill a 1,200 seat auditorium. So it works pretty well. Placement of the sound-post requires working through the f holes on the front of the bass. A luthier will have the tool and the skills to do this. It is not a job I would recommend for an amateur. Yeah, you can do it but you probably won\u2019t do it as well. Who knew that the principles of simple machines had so much to do with art? ",
