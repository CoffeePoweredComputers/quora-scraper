            "answer_text": "Well, It is actually easy and challenging at same time. But let me get this straight and clear.Here it goes : You need to find the band partner that really clicked with you,this is critical. Simon & Garfunkel were an American folk rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. They were one of the best-selling music groups of the 1960s and became counterculture icons of the decade's social revolution, alongside artists such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan. Their biggest hits\u2014including \"The Sound of Silence\" (1964), \"Mrs. Robinson\" (1968), \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" (1969), and \"The Boxer\" (1969)\u2014reached number one on singles charts worldwide. Their often rocky relationship led to artistic disagreements, which resulted in their breakup in 1970. Their final studio record, Bridge over Troubled Water (released in January of that year), was their most successful, becoming one of the world's best-selling albums. Since their split in 1970 they have reunited several times, most famously in 1981 for, \"The Concert in Central Park\", which attracted more than 500,000 people, the seventh-largest concert attendance in history. As quoted from Wikipedia (I love you Jimmy Wales !) As you can see,Simon and Garfunkel were one of the best-selling duo of the \u201960 with 10 Grammy Awards and also inducted to Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame at 1990.Although they were very good and I respected them very well,they also had rocky relationship at each other that resulted to the break-up. Imagine what would happened if they did not breakup faster as i love their song \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water\u201d. So,make sure to find partner that clicked with you,accept you as YOU and know your weakness and talent at the same time. You need to compliment each other weaknesses and practice regularly to make a good bond.As i told you above,your partner must be the compliment to your weaknesses.If you are singer that can not play instrument,your partner should be one to accompany the music for you,or if you can play guitar maybe your partner can play other instrument to make richer music.You also can make two-part harmonies singing as it is also cool.Train your harmonies and you can see many successful Duo on YouTube as references (Simon&Garfunkel,Maywood or Savage Garden to name a few) and see which ones fit you so well from the genres to the style.Then train,train and train! Find places to start your gig (Cafe,Lounge,etc) or start social media sensation (from YouTube to Soundcloud)Practice without execution is nothing,find nearest cafe or lounge then talk to the cafe or lounge manager about you and your partner desire to play.Maybe some managers will give you audition.You and your partner maybe will get rejected,but you need to grow stronger and always ask opinion from others to improve your band! After you find the cafe or lounge that clicked with your band,you\u2019re not only just make a duo but also make money and maybe fame from it!Also post some videos to Social Media to make your fans (that maybe you make from the cafe or lounge) know your updates or covers. Hope this answers! Cheers! (Image were taken from Google Images and it is from www.simonandgarfunkel.com,the official website of the band) ",

            "answer_text": "I'll tell you what worked for me: Find some one you enjoy playing music with. You both like the same songs, or each can be convinced to like enough of the other person\u2019s likes. Pick a half -dozen or so, and learn them, and practice them. Decide if you are a primarily vocal or primarily instrumental. Practice. When you think you're ready, go and do some open mikes. See what kind of reaction you get. Find out which songs work with you and with the audience. Congratulations, you're a band ",
