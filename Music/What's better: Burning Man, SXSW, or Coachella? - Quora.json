            "answer_text": "Burning Man all the way! Burning Man has a few great things going for it that the other don\u2019t. It\u2019s not a commercial venture. No one is getting rich off of Burning Man. Most of the ticket costs go to Bureau of Land Management fees (a lot!), infrastructure such as lots of porta-potties, paying the, sadly now required, law enforcement and emergency services people, and paying some of the key employees who bust their asses. A lot of money also goes to funding the artists who make those incredible giant things you\u2019ll encounter nowhere but on the playa. Burning man is a break from consumerism. There are no sponsors, ads, trinket stands, or anything to but but reasonably priced ice, coffee, and tea.It\u2019s a real community, with newspapers, a funky post office, radio stations and everybody being cool to each other.Burning Man is participatory. Forget standing passively in giant crowds watching bands. At Burning Man, you encouraged to participate, create, and interact. You\u2019re as important as anything else going on there, if you put in a little effort. You can express yourself radically and not get harassed for it at Burning Man.Ask anyone who has been to Burning Man what they thought of it. It\u2019s like NOTHING else in the world. And don\u2019t believe the sensationalists stories you read about it. Yeah, they\u2019re probably true, but there are MANY aspects that don\u2019t get covered.Burning Man physically takes you away from the default world of traffic, cell phones, shopping, television, and all the other crap that is twisting us the wrong way.The other two events are just a bunch of bands and djs, with continued options to spend a lot of money. is that really the best experience you can find? And if you still want bands and djs, there are plenty of those at Burning Man, too.",

            "answer_text": "Those events have NOTHING to do with each other. The question might as well read, \u201cwhich of these the three things is the best? A dodo bird, a lightbulb, or the number zero? Show your work.\u201d there might be overlap in attendees, but that is probably more in your imagination than in actuality. To be clear SXSW is a new media convention. Workie work time! Coachella is a mainstream music festival. Good times. And burning man is an art festival that might kill you, which is convenient for your afterlife because it is located roughly in the pit of hell itself. Assuming that the event does not kill you, it will make you weirder. SXSW will seem like a garden tea party attended by people more into hype than actually doing stuff. And your now former Coachella buddies will start to resemble those geese that they force feed to make pate, what with their waddling their pack behavior and the always looking up at some distant figure/DJ. You will refer to both of these kinds of people as assholes and douche bags, and you will do this while wearing pink and white polkadotted assless chaps with and an eel skin holographic g string. You will not find this ironic or even slightly unusual, you have shit to weld and it's going to happen right now. Never go to burning man. Stick to whatever it is that normal people do, not that I know what that is, in my case the damage is permenant. ",
