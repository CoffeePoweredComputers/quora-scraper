            "answer_text": "Man, so hard to choose.  If I have to pick one, it's the first, but I list the others as well. The first two are more spiritual, even though I'd hardly call myself a Christian, and the second two are fun songs. 1. O Holy Night, sung by Bing Crosby is a particular fave, because of it's gravitas, solemnity, and spirituality, as well as it's beauty. When he gets to the chorus it's hard not to feel chills. 2.  God Bless Ye Merry Gentlemen, sung by Sarah McLaughlan and Barenaked Ladies. Two artists I would never listen to. But this song again is so beautiful and gives me chills for its spirituality and feeling. 3. Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree, sung by Brenda Lee. This song, along with more rock n roll Christmas songs like Bruce Springsteen's Santa Claus is Coming to Town, and the Wall of Sound songs like I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus and Sleigh Ride, and Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) just remind me of of Christmas Eve parties hosted by friends and families with aunts and uncles, just timeless classics that make me feel nostalgia and the fun and energy of the season. 4. Sleigh Ride sung by Johnny Mathis, and It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year  sung by Andy Williams.  These songs are so classic and joyful. ",
