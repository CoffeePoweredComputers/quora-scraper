            "answer_text": "I will not recommend anything less than an 88 key if you are serious about playing. The keywidth is really small in a 49 key keyboard. In fact, it\u2019s not even an real keyboard. It\u2019s a toy. When you practice with a 37 or 49 key keyboard, your fingers become used to small keywidth. Then when you upgrade it to a real piano, you\u2019ll find it difficult to unlearn and relearn. I bought a 49 key keyboard since I wanted to use it as the substitute for a hand organ. I hold it like the organ, vertically that is, and play with one hand. The keys gave me a hell lot of trouble at first. I had to constantly remind myself that it\u2019s not a piano I\u2019m playing. If you want to do anything that insane, a 49 key toy will probably serve well. But, if you\u2019re serious, I repeat, if you\u2019re serious then, don\u2019t buy it. Rob a bank, extort a homeless dude, steal from your sister\u2019s piggybank. I don\u2019t care how you get the money. Just get yourself a real keyboard. ",
