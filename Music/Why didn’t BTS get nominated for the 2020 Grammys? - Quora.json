            "answer_text": "Their fans will likely be mad about this answer\u2026 but I don\u2019t think it had as much to do with race and culture as people think, although I\u2019m sure it played a role, but there are other factors I believe. BTS entered into categories against primarily Western artists that top the charts here. That was part of the problem. BTS against Ariana Grande or Taylor Swift or H.E.R. for a Grammy award.... BTS will probably lose every time. That\u2019s the reality. It doesn\u2019t matter how many Twitter interactions and YouTube views they get, it doesn\u2019t even matter how many albums they sell. The Grammys are not solely based on sales and popularity. I think it would be a really cool feat if a non English speaking artist could grab a nomination or even a win, because America and Canada are both quite multicultural, but it will probably take some more time. The Grammys are ultimately decided by the Academy voting members, other musicians, other professionals in the industry, etc. I don\u2019t know what the right answer is as to why BTS didn\u2019t get any nominations. I do think BTS has Grammy worthy music, but I don\u2019t think the music they released this year was it. Just my opinion of course, it doesn\u2019t mean the music wasn\u2019t good. And if I\u2019m honest, a lot of the main categories have music nominated that I wouldn\u2019t call Grammy worthy either. Album of the Year: For example, Vampire Weekend is nominated for Album of the Year for Father of the Bride. If you compare that album to Map of the Soul Persona, it looks a litttttle different. As in, Ezra Koenig (lead vocalist and guitarist of Vampire Weekend) is an executive producer on the album, co-wrote every song on the album and produced all but 2 songs on the album. He\u2019s also the only credited songwriter on 7 of the albums songs. Lana Del Rey is nominated for Album of the Year for Norman Fucking Rockwell, and she\u2019s credited as a writer and producer (excluding track 10) on every single song except Doin Time as that was a remake of Sublime. BTS had multiple producers and writers for their album, they\u2019re also not credited as producers on any of the songs. Map of the Soul also only has 7 tracks while Norman Rockwell has 14 and Father of the Bride has 18 plus bonus tracks. BTS is impressive in the Kpop world, but straight across comparing their album, it doesn\u2019t match up to these guys, and Bon Iver\u2019s album which I didn\u2019t mention in detail but is also more impressive.   The middle column is listed writers on the song and the far right column is listed producers. Here is Lana Del Rey\u2019s album for comparison (I left out her remake of Doin Time which is track 5 because it was.. a remake)   As you can see, Boy With Luv had more writers on that single track than Lana Del Rey had on her entire album. All other nominees including Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and HER, (except Lil Nas X, sorry) have impressive track lists with each artist credited as a writer on almost all tracks and a few credited as producing tracks and/or the album. This is where BTS fans struggle in comparing them to Western artists. It\u2019s pretty common to have artists here write and produce their own music. It\u2019s almost laughable when a musician doesn\u2019t play a hand in that actually. BTS is good at writing and composition compared to other current Kpop groups, because that\u2019s not really the norm in Kpop. But in the west, it is, and these artists are much more impressive than BTS in that regard. I chose to dissect this category because Album of the Year is an important one to many artists. The only artist I would maybe argue doesn\u2019t belong here is Lil Nas X. He\u2019s fun and his album was actually pretty good for a new guy, but he doesn\u2019t stand a chance against the other nominees in my opinion. Don\u2019t get mad at me fans of BTS, but if you want them to be winning major awards against huge Western artists then they better bring their best. And I don\u2019t think they did this time. That\u2019s all. I also couldn\u2019t live with BTS getting nominated and losing, then the fans rioting because they lost (think Beyonc\u00e9 vs Beck a few years ago. Her fans lost their shit, but sorry Beck\u2019s album was much more impressive and well done than Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s...) The Grammys invited BTS, interviewed them, all that, and made it seem as though they had a shot.. but this is the same academy that invited Mac Miller\u2019s family to the Grammys only to snub his posthumous \u2018Swimming\u2019 album and give the win to Cardi B... which was a terrible choice if you ask me. There\u2019s always going to be more opportunities and BTS has already accomplished so much. They don\u2019t need to win everything. They\u2019ve done lots to be proud of. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not too surprised that BTS weren\u2019t nominated but I do think they could\u2019ve gotten at least something. And to be quite honest, Persona was not their best work at all. If anything, Tear was robbed because that album was really good and one of the best out of LY era. My top two favorite albums along with Wings. BWL was a corny ass, Disney filled song that was too safe and didn\u2019t show their potential. Sure, you can say the same thing about the artists that were nominated but at least some of them have contributed to their music and made an impact. Yes, BTS does have sales popularity but musically, they haven\u2019t made an impact. Folks can clown Lil Nas X all day but even OTW made an impact and created a conversation. Another thing, you can write your own music and it still be trash. Sorry but I never saw the hype for Taylor Swift at all. She can write all day but I will never see her as more talented than Adele, and she\u2019s not my favorite either, or Beyonc\u00e9. Had to put that there because people think because you write own music makes you more talented and that\u2019s not always the case. It just shows that ARMYs do care about western validation as much as they claim they don\u2019t. Look at the outrage over the PCA loss and the VMAS. Deep down, you care because if you didn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be this outrage over a Grammy. There are plenty of artists, primarily black artists, who stays getting snubbed no matter how hard they work. Beyonc\u00e9 can write a whole damn album if she wanted to and will never get an AOTY. Sad but true. ARMYs want to complain about racism and xenophobia when it\u2019s convenient for them but when artists who aren\u2019t white don\u2019t win or are nominated, they don\u2019t give a damn! So please, stop acting like you care about diversity when you don\u2019t at all. Plus, most of y\u2019all are racist as hell when it comes to black artists. Hell black people in general. While it does suck that BTS didn\u2019t get anything, maybe this serves as a wake up for them to bring it music wise because they are a good group and I enjoy them but BH needs to let them have more control on their music and stop trying to please a certain group of people. Don\u2019t lose what made BTS great in the first place. There\u2019s more I want to say but I\u2019m tired right now. All in all, ARMYs need to calm down. Seriously, it\u2019s not the end of the world. ",
