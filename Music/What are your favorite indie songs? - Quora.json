            "answer_text": "Last year in July, I started watching a TV series. Normally in American TV shows, one can find many songs of famous bands, or indie groups. So at the end of the first episode, this melodious guitar started playing with the chanting of \u201cLa dn da La dn da\u201d that transported me to a different realm that I have never felt before. It was incredibly beautiful. It was true music. It took me some time to find the song on the internet because you search just the lyrics of the song that is \u201cWatch Me\u201d on Google or YouTube, you won't be able to find the song. Such a hidden gem it is. Since then I have heard it countless times, have fallen in love with this song, and gets a feeling that I have fallen in love with someone very special listening to this song.  Courtesy: Youtube So the TV show is This is Us, the artist is Labi Siffre and the song is Watch Me with this amazing lyrics and background music. Watch me when you call my name See me sparkle, see me flame Singing a song, playing a game Oh I am so glad you came These first four lines sets the mood but before that when you hear the first chord of the song, you know from your heart that something different is coming. And this line Oh, I am so glad you came brings genuine gratitude for this life, for the singer, for his music, for his voice, for his writings, and for everything else that matters. Watch me when you look my way See me smiling, be my night and day Touch me in your sweet way Feel me tremble, you take my words away If you are in complete love, these lines brings warm, euphoric sensation on your skin. Just feel the lyrics with closed eyes! Watch me when I am on my own See me falling like the snow Come and be the thing you are I am still falling, but not quite so far Labi has saved the best for the last. When I listened to this part, I remember one more song of one of my favourite Indie artist, Eddie Vedder. One can also listen to Labi Siffre's other great songs: Old Time SongRemember my SongSomething inside so strongDreamerCrying, laughing, loving, lyingIt must be loveMy Song",

            "answer_text": "Many of the late night talk shows end with a musical guest. Many of these are indie groups. There are some dogs but there's also alot of gems. When I'm home I'll usually listen to the musical group what half an ear. As it happens, this one caught my ear and continue to be an earworm for the next several days. The only way I could solve the problem was by putting it on my playlist so it would stop haunting me. From Austin, Texas, Wild Child with their hit Crazy Bird,  ",
