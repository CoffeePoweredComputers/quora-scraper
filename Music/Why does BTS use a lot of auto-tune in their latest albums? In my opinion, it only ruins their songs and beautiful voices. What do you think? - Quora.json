            "answer_text": "I don't share this opinion. You are entitled to your opinion, as always for any opinion. I haven't heard a lot of autoned BTS (even lately). And when it's autotuned, it's slight (at least to me). Fake Love, Black Swan and Ego are the three I can think of. With Fake Love and Black Swan, it was slight (imo) and artistic. Like it fit the song and wasn't jarring and I didn't really notice at first. For me, autotune is fine in those cases. A non-kpop example is \u201cHeartless\u201d by Kanye West (not a huge fan of his but I love that song). With Ego, it's only a few lines and again it just fits with the tempo and all before switching to J-Hope's natural vocals. I only have an issue with autotune when it reaches Rebecca Black's \u201cFriday\u201d levels. If I'm honest here, the autotune in Cat & Dog by TXT bothers me more than anything of BTS's. ",

            "answer_text": "Oooh, interesting! I\u2019ve always thought of autotune as the seasoning of a meal! If you overdo it, the meal is awful, but not enough and it\u2019s plain and boring! I\u2019ve also noticed BTS has quite the variety of vocal range, sometimes the autotune helps blend their voices and help them not to sound like they\u2019re straining. For example, I\u2019ve picked up in the live performances that Dynamite is a little high for Taehyung, but on the track he sounds fine. Now I understand the point of their beautiful voices, I love JK\u2019s twitter songs and other moments where they sing live, so there\u2019s nothing wrong with that! I haven\u2019t noticed it being too much in my opinion, but then again you\u2019re talking to someone who loves Anpanman so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc9c ",
