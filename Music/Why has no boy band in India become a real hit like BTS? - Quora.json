            "answer_text": "Simple logic, India is so diversified that we have so many languages and most of them have their own entertainment industry. Me being an Indian, I don't know more than five languages of India. So obviously, if there is an amazing song in Bengali or Marathi or any other language, I would not be aware of it. When we are so much diversified, it is simply not possible. On the other hand, South Korea is a country with One National language plus their marketing strategies for kpop is too good. Also Kpop is nothing but westernized Korean songs, but in India we tend to listen to our own music genres, be it classical, folk, Sufi etc, which most of them outside our country can't relate to. Most importantly, we don't even have to worry about being popular. If being talented is proportional to being popular, then I loathe at the the very definition of talent. We are good in our genre, and that's what matters. We don't have to copy someone to be relevant or popular! We are amazing in our own music sense. ",

BTS\u2019 recent music is same as western ones and western ones are pretty popular in India. Stars like Charlie path, Shawn Men's , Camila Cabello, Post Malone, Justin Burner and pretty much every Popstar is famous to some extent. So, BTS are easily liked by some although Most of the Indians are pretty racist and Xenophobic but they do listen if it \u201cdigestible\u201d like the ones from the stars i mentioned. ",
