            "answer_text": "It is really interesting seeing how much of Spotify's catalogue actually gets played, opposed to say the music download stores. Normally in a digital music store, around 80% of the catalogue has never been bought by anyone.  In Spotify's case it's almost the reverse. 70% of our 11m songs are being played during a year. With social sharing and more cultures exploring different kinds of music, we have started to see behavioral shifts.  For instance the band Glasvegas wasn't even supposed to release their record in Sweden, but did so, made platinum on Spotify and sold out their shows in less than 30 minutes. All this due to people liking their music and sharing it across borders. ",
