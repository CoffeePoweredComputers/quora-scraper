            "answer_text": "I played a lot of horror games. Horror is my favorite genre. As a kid, I used to watch lots of horror films from the '70s, '80s and the '90s. I watched scary videos, read scary stories, played scary games, and that was all part of the fun. Games like Amnesia: the dark descent, Alien: isolation I did enjoy. They didn't really scare me. In amnesia you pretty much walk around the castle, solve puzzles, and encounters with monsters are rare. Sometimes you hallucinate, and you have to figure out if the monster that's chasing you is real or a hallucination. Alien: Isolation has a great atmosphere, level design, and most importantly, excellent A.I. The game itself didn't really scare me, it more frustrated me because of the xenomorph's unpredictable A.I. If I had to pick a game that deeply unsettled me, both physically and mentally. I would have to choose the Power Drill Massacre.  Power drill massacre is an indie horror game that was released in 2015 by Puppet Combo. Puppet combo (originally Pig Farmer games) is an indie horror game studio, mostly known for creating 80's styled VHS slasher horror games for PC. The developer did release a lot of good horror games, but the power drill massacre is what put him on the map. *Spoilers ahead* The plot follows a woman named Megan, who gets in a car crash, far from the city. She survives the crash but her passenger Jeff is badly injured. She grabs her flashlight and goes into the woods to look for help. She eventually stumbles across a seemingly old, abandoned factory and goes inside in hopes of finding help. But soon she wishes she never entered the factory in the first place, as it turns out to be a lair of a dangerous killer armored with a power drill. The game itself is very reminiscent of ps1/ps2 games like silent hill or resident evil. The atmosphere of the game is very eerie, the whole interior of the factory and details are very realistic, it's like a real factory. The goal of the game is to explore the whole factory and escape. You pretty much walk around, gather items, read old newspapers and notes, and you listen to the surroundings.  And there's the main attraction of the game: The killer. When you walk and suddenly hear loud footsteps, you must run because it's him. Each time he appears the screen starts flashing and the killer makes a loud pig like screams. To avoid him, you must run as far away from him. When you reach a certain distance, he will stop chasing you. Also, avoid large metal doors, because that's where he can also appear from and attack you. The killer showing up isn't the only scary thing in the game. One time while I was walking down the hallway, I came to a public bathroom and heard somebody crying. I stood there listening but had to retreat because the killer appeared (it wasn't the killer crying). Similar things like in Silent Hill 2. Also in the game, as I mentioned before you can read torn newspaper articles and notes that you find in certain rooms. There are many newspaper articles that you can find describing the missing cases of campers and hitchhikers. Outside the factory you can see somebody standing on the balcony, could it be the ghost of a camper that was murdered by the killer? Also, there's one newspaper that mentioned a little girl that went missing many years ago. She was camping with her parents and as her parents described, she went to play somewhere outside the camp area and disappeared. Her parents believed she was abducted. In the game, if you pay attention, you might be able to capture a little girl running down the hallways and disappearing. Could it be her? Parts of the game that get me the most, are the endings. Yes, there are 2 ending to the game. In the bad ending after navigating through the sugar tunnel, Megan stumbles across the killer's lair, it's details are really chilling and disturbing. The wall paint is falling off, there's meat on the floor, there's some old furniture, the skeleton in the mattress, and there's one corner with toys. Megan describes it: \"Whoever lives here seems to have the mind of a child.\" Soon, the killer shows up and attacks you. There's nothing you can do at that point because you're locked, you can pretty much run in circles but the killer will get you. After killer captures Megan, she wakes up locked in the cage, with her clothes stripped and starts crying for help. The killer shows up and Megan screams in fear. The killer tries to talk to her, and by that, I do mean tries. He mumbles and talks gibberish, like a child trying to speak. Megan doesn't understand him, so he walks away, puts a lullaby on and attacks Megan, butchering her with a power drill. A biblical reference is displayed: \"AND DEATH AND HELL WERE CAST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE. THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH. REVELATION 20:14\" Power Drill Massacre: Bad Ending In the true ending, after you manage to collect all 3 keys and unlocks the door on the 2nd floor, Megan finds herself in a very long hallway. She sees a little girl in the distance and calls for her but the little girl doesn't reply and instead runs away. Megan runs after her, and after catching up with the little girl, the little girl suddenly stops running. The killer appears, little girl vanishes and killer pursues Megan through a long hallway. As Megan is being chased, the screen slowly flashes in until it completely fades to white. Afterward, the screen fades to a nighttime view of the mountains from the beginning, while a radio station is played, it mentions that Jeff, that guy who got injured in the crash was found but Megan is still missing. As the radio changes to a static, a lullaby plays over, and somebody could be heard groaning, screaming and crying out loud as the game title appears. Power Drill Massacre [All 3 keys + True Ending] People have many theories about this ending. Many speculate that Megan was captured and tortured and those cries are hers. However, I don't think that's the case. Those screams sound more from a frustration, devastation, anger and crying at the same time, but not suffering or pain, if you've seen the bad ending you know what I mean. Also, I don't hear a power drill. So I think that's the killer crying, after losing Megan he returned to his lair, put the lullaby on and started crying and throwing tantrum. Megan may have escaped into the woods, still far from the city, suffering from emotional shock. It is pretty evident that the killer is a 2-meter cannibalistic maniac whose mind remained at the level of a 3-year-old child. But what made him a murderous killer? Also, one newspaper article mentioned that this place was originally an orphanage that was later converted into a factory, could the killer be one of the children from that orphanage? Was he abused as a child? The long hallway where the little girl is running away from Megan doesn't look like a factory interior, it certainly looks like an orphanage. And those were my thoughts on the power drill massacre. I recommend this game if you're a fan of horror. Also, check out Puppet Combo's other games.

            "answer_text": "What? Or which? This is a very personal question. Some people would like one more than the other. Those who like classics will immediately think about Silent Hill, and they may just be right.  The thing is, suspense always have their eras. Back in the day, Silent Hill and Resident Evil were top notch \u201cscary games\u201d. Particularly, I could not play the first silent hill, I had nightmares for days because of the damn radio sound, but then again I was just a kid. While Zombies did already exist, they set up a generation of games. The Era of monsters, if you want.  In the darkness of this games, another not-as-well-known title existed, System Shock 2, that fussed Half Life gameplay style with horror, REAL PSYCHOLOGICAL horror.  When the world was thinking that was it, something happened. They got a taste of Japanese Horror, in the form of Fatal Frame II. And my god this game is terrifying.  The world saw Japanese horror could take the genre by storm, and so they tried. But as this was happening, one game again turned the tide  Fear took the best of action games like System Shock, and the horrifying Japanese style horror, and mixed into a complete masterpiece. And my god this game was terrifying. After a while of sequels, capcom would make \u201cmaster move\u201d and release the so awaited return of Leon Kennedy, in Resident Evil 4, one of the best games ever made.  However, this game wasn\u2019t so great news for the lovers of the suspense and horror, as it barely had any of it left. This game would lead companies to kinda forget about the horror genre for a while. FEAR 2 and 3 got influenced by this kind of culture, and in came games like Resident Evil 5, a total disaster, and to my disappointment, Silent Hill Homecoming. While Silent Hill still had goriness and suspense there and there, it was a very long shot from their predecessors, which made you think if they had actually learned anything from what they had done before. And then, the horror genre had made a full stop. Until this game appeared.  Penumbra was a good game, but it couldn\u2019t almost be considered a game, since it was not a commercial success by a long shot. Amnesia however took the bull by the horns. The fact of being unable to defend yourself against the monsters, the fact that being in darkness was, for once, really bad for your health, was an incredible concept made true. This was psychological horror in ways that were never seen before, forcing people to hide from danger, to hear each and every sound, their ears being their only real method of surviving. And of course, the gaming industry took notes. The new era had begun. Amnesia did a revolution. Games like Outlast and Soma came up. And with them, a demo we will forever remember  PT took on a combination between Amnesia and FEAR. You are powerless against a ghost that haunts you. This DEMO terrified the entire world. There are still games being released to this day based on PTs playstyle, like Layers of Fear. Even Resident evil took their own from this, as Resident Evil 7\u2019s Demo was made in the same style as PT, and the game itself is as well terrifying, and now, we can see this \u201cdarker style\u201d as well in Resident Evil II remake. For all of this, I believe PT, even being a Demo, is the best horror game ever ",
