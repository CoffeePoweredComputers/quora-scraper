            "answer_text": "It's never too late. Granted I started learning guitar when I was 12 years old; however, I started really getting into piano around 23-24 years old. I've learned so many new things so far in my twenties. It's never too late to learn anything new. You just have to consistently practice and if you have enough passion and hunger for it, that won't be a problem at all. Playing the guitar is easier than you may think, I was completely self-taught through learning to read guitar tabs, buying instructional videos (they were VHS tapes at the time), using resources online, taking music theory, and learning to read sheet music. There are many excellent resources online that teach you everything from how to hold the pick and playing basic chords, to learning modes, scales, alternate/sweep picking, harmonics, phrasing, etc. Learn to read guitar tablature, work on learning some basic exercises to improve your chops, then either pick up a guitar tab book of your favorite band/artist and learn the songs in the book...you'll find yourself advancing quickly. I went from first learning \"Iron Man\" by Black Sabbath to learning more technically advanced songs in just one year of consistent practice like \"Eruption\" by Van Halen.  Last, but not least: I can't overemphasize enough the importance of \"ear training\", the art of being able to decipher musical components through listening alone. Training your musical ear is one of the most important ways to anchor the connection between the musical ideas you have in your head and the sound created on your guitar. Arguably the easiest way to begin training your ear is to start off with playing a C Major scale (C D E F G A B) at any position on your guitar and sing/hum each note of the scale as you play it. Try to sing it as close in pitch as possible.  Remember: Practice. Practice. Practice. We need more people playing real musical instruments and less people playing \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\".

            "answer_text": "There is this generic question: \"I am [age] years old. Is it too late to [something].\" Seriously, I see dozens of those questions. Here, look what I see on the right side of Quora page:    Do you know what everyone says to those questions? NO IT IS NOT. If you want to learn something, if you want to do something, experiment or enjoy new activities and you even have the passions and motivation for that, then by all means do so. Talent is nothing more but a combination of many hours of practice and passion. It is hard though. Not something you can do from one day to another. Requires constant effort and work that you need to put in. So start playing guitar already! ",
