            "answer_text": "The Grace, hands down.  Although it was a short-lived girl group consisting of four members (Lina, Dana, Sunday, and Stephanie), the girls had the vocals, harmony, choreography, and looks to be the next big thing in KPop. They were supposed to be female version of TVXQ, who at that time was the biggest male group in South Korea. But SM decided to invest more on Girls Generation, who were formed to be the female counterpart to Super Junior. With the rise of other rival girl groups like Girls Generation (despite being the same label), Wonder Girls, Kara, Brown Eyed Girls, 4 Minute, After School, T-Ara, f(x), 2NE1 (who were supposed to be the female version of Big Bang), The Grace didn\u2019t manage to retain its success in the in the late 2000s to early 2010s, so they fell out of the radar. But till this day, I have yet to see a female group that harmonizes so well together. All the members could sing lead and dance. They didn\u2019t follow the formulaic structure of a lot of KPop groups, where one member sings lead, taking most of the lines like the bridge and climax, while another member is the rapper, and the other is known for her dancing, and the other member is known for her looks, or acting in KDramas. No. Each and everyone of these girls were the lead vocalist, dancers, and beauties. The roles they played in their group was very balanced. They were the full package. It was also not a big group that had an unnecessary number of members. Four members seems like an adequate number to me.    ",

            "answer_text": "By this question, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re asking which groups have members who are all very vocally talented. Although these are not my bias groups nor are my biases in those groups, I think Davichi and Mamamoo are the most talented in terms of vocals. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d count Davichi as a girl group though, as they\u2019re more of a duo that only sings. But man, they can sing. And in Mamamoo, even the rappers are good at singing. My favorite songs by Davichi are \u201cDon\u2019t Say Goodbye\u201d, \u201cYou Are My Everything\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Leave\u201d. My favorite songs by Mamamoo are \u201cYou\u2019re The Best\u201d, \u201cJust\u201d and \u201cI Miss You\u201d. Butttt if you mean which groups have at least one member who is very vocally talented\u2026 SNSD tops the list because Taeyeon is my bias and I love her to death. My favorite songs by SNSD\u2026 I\u2019m not even going to list any because I\u2019ll end up listing all of them. ",
