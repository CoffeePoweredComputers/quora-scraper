            "answer_text": "Some of my favorite memories were the \"oohs and aahs\" of physics teachers taking us outside to demonstrate a rocket or chemistry teachers making things explode. Those were always great ways of sparking interest and remained quite memorable. However, my favorite teacher and favorite memories of a class and teacher were all from a class called \"Current Issues\". It was a high school class for the oldest secondary students, what we call seniors. We were all 17 or 18 at the time. There were two very memorable trips we went on - one was to a State Prison and another was do go \"flyering\" for a politician (that we chose). The class dealt with these types of current issues -- unfair imprisonment system, three strikes rule,  abortion debate, gender inequality, etc... a lot of taboo and political issues.  The most memorable part about this teacher, and style of teaching, was that he treated us like adults and made us think for ourselves. The flyering thing was interesting - because we had to choose who to support. He didn't care who we supported, as long as we had chosen that person for good reasons (based on our own beliefs) and who express that to him. Many students found that this was a teacher you could speak to about real life issues outside of the classroom, be it drugs, alcohol, relationships, etc, and he would always listen and give good advice. This was without a doubt the most memorable teacher I had, and he always had the most well behaved students in his classroom because of the way he treated them.  --- A different memory of a different teacher took place in university. I was in a class called \"The African Storyteller\". It was taught by an amazing professor who was 73 at the time, with a sharp voice and a ridiculous combover. He had spent many years during the apartheid times walking up and down the coast of some African countries going from village to village collecting stories. That sounds like nothing - but you have to imagine the situation. This was many years ago, with big huge recording equipment (not like a simple voice recorder we could use today), and a white man with this equipment approaching a village of people whose language he did not speak and who had zero trust for white men, zero experience with them and very little reason to accept anything that came from his mouth.  So, bit by bit he gained their trust and was able to eventually record some of their stories. Storytelling in this region and in many parts of the world is a big, big deal, and is how knowledge and culture is passed down from generation to generation.  So- that's all some background on this teacher and what he taught. The memory was that this teacher was always VERY strict about attendance and punctuality in his class- which was a lecture with 300+ students. In most large university classes with 100+ students (at least at my university) attendance was not taken, it was up to you to go or not, and you could show up pretty much whenever you wanted. Not this one -- because he valued his material so much (and for good reason) that he would not let you disrespect it by showing up halfway through. You would have been disrespecting the very cultures they had come from. One day in the very back row of this lecture, some boys started standing up and trying to get his attention. Naturally he became furious and started yelling at them asking what was going on. A boy next to them had passed out, so they were trying to call an ambulance to come get him. They eventually passed the dispatcher to the professor, who told them what building and room we were in and that they should come. As usual, the dispatcher asked him to stay on the line until they arrived to update them or to let them know if anything else happened. He simply said \"I told you, we we are in the large lecture hall room xx (don't remember the room number) in the Humanities building. I can't stay on the line I've got a class to teach.\" and hung up. Shocking and hilarious (funny since the boy was okay and nothing bad happened to him in the end. I will definitely never forget that moment or that professor. There were comics about him in the school newspaper after that happened! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! My favourite teacher is my chemistry <3 teacher! I blessed to get a teacher like her! I like all my teachers in school but she is someone special to me! The teacher whom I call ma'am instead of mom!! She is strict but at the same time caring and loving , I was able to sense that. Memories <3 :) She gave the best memories!! During our trip, I came to know more about her and that's when I realized she is mother to us and not a teacher . I started longing for her love and affection. For her caring and loving nature I would become a slave. We had DJ party and camp fire during our excursion. They allowed us to dance and we were dancing for 3 hours literally. We were no more exhausted we kept on dancing. Then we called all our teachers to dance with us. Even though she didn't want to dance we made her dance. And suddenly as time went we started crying . 3/4 of them cried because it was our last year of schooling. After which we had to go for dinner! We were crying to the most because we couldn't control ourselves. Some how I tried to control myself Then my chemistry teacher asked me not to cry, she said you people have more days to go. When she spoke to me, again I was in tears and I felt helpless. I hugged her and I started crying ,I didn't have a feeling that I'm hugging a teacher but, she gave the feel of a mother . Then after few minutes I controlled myself and I saw her in tears but she tried hard to control herself too. Then she convinced us and insisted that everyone should have our dinner. Then when we returned I and my friend (ishwarya) had conversation with her. She spoke out frankly. We came to know more and more about her. But that was not enough, I want to know more about her! Her protective nature was to the extreme! Then it was the time to end our journey! I wanted the trip once more, I felt I want to go back to that time! Atlast we went home. In class we have a hearty laugh at her jokes. But she is a sincere, dedicated and a genuine teacher. Even though she didn't want to become a teacher, she did that for her mother's sake because her mother wanted her to become a teacher. I'm thankful to her mother , for she has given the best teacher and a mother by heart! No matter what I really love her! I don't know whether she likes me or not, but I will always love her and see her as my mother! I will always want to be your favourite devil! Thank you ma'am for all the memories that you gave us. Even though , spending 2 years with you was a short span of time, you made it sweet and memorable! I don't no whether everybody likes you, but I promise that I will remain with the same love and affection always!! With happy tears -venkatalakshmi ",
