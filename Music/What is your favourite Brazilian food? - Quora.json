Barbecued meat  Brazil and Argentina both claim to be South America\u2019s barbecue champion. And while each country takes a different approach to its meat, from the cuts to the accompaniments, some things remain the same \u2013 namely, the ogre-sized quantities of meat, best appreciated at a leisurely pace and with an elasticated waistband. In Brazil, premium cuts (the most popular being picanha, or rump cap) are seasoned with no more than a liberal shake of coarse salt, before being grilled to pink perfection over charcoal (or wood, if you\u2019re doing it the old-fashioned Southern way). Home barbecues will see sausages, queijo coalho (squeaky cheese on a stick) and chicken hearts sharing space on the grill, while in churrascarias (barbecue-style steakhouses), all manner of meats on skewers \u2013 from pork to lamb and wild boar \u2013 will be sliced by waiters straight onto your plate. 2. Moqueca (pronounced moo-kek-a)  More than a mere fish stew, moqueca is served with theatrical flourish as the piping hot clay pot is uncovered at the table amid clouds of fragrant steam. Baianos (residents of Bahia, in the north-east of the country) and Capixabas (from the neighbouring state of Esp\u00edrito Santo) both lay claim to the origins of the dish, and both serve up equally tasty variations. At its simplest, fish and/or other seafood are stewed in diced tomatoes, onions and coriander. The Capixabas add annatto seeds for a natural red food colouring, while the Baianos serve a heavier version, made with palm oil, peppers and coconut milk. It\u2019s teamed with rice, farofa (toasted manioc flour \u2013 ideal for mopping up juices) and pir\u00e3o (a spicy fish porridge made with manioc flour \u2013 far tastier than it sounds). 3. Cacha\u00e7a  Dating back to the 1500s, cacha\u00e7a is made from fermented sugarcane juice and is best known as the fiery kick in caipirinhas \u2013 Brazil\u2019s national cocktail. While caipirinhas are often made with uncoloured, unaged cacha\u00e7as, there are thousands of better-quality golden varieties available, aged in wooden barrels and sipped straight up by aficionados. For the morning after, clear your head with a Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica (a sweet, fizzy soft drink), an \u00e1gua de coco (coconut water, best sipped straight from the coconut) or caldo de cana (freshly pressed sugarcane juice). 4. Brigadeiros  Brazil\u2019s answer to the chocolate truffle, brigadeiros are so simple to make that they quite literally get rolled out for kids\u2019 parties nationwide. The sweet balls are made by simmering condensed milk with cocoa powder, then whisking in butter and shaping the mix into balls before rolling in chocolate sprinkles. Guaranteed to give an instant sugar high, they\u2019re cloyingly sweet for some palates. Brazilians won\u2019t hear a word against them, though. 5. P\u00e3o de queijo  Cheese and bread \u2013 two staple favourites the world over \u2013 are brought together in glorious union in Brazil\u2019s p\u00e3o de queijo, a moreish snack enjoyed at any time of day. Crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, the gluten-free bread rolls are made with tapioca flour, eggs and grated curado minas cheese (a cow\u2019s milk cheese from the state of Minas Gerais), rolled into small balls. For a naughty twist, keep an eye out for p\u00e3o de queijo served in fist-sized rolls (or even a cake-sized bake), stuffed with cream cheese or various meaty fillings. 6. Acaraj\u00e9 (pronounced a-ka-ra-zjeh) One of the most calorie-laden street snacks I\u2019ve ever had the good fortune to try, acaraj\u00e9 is a deep-fried patty of crushed black-eyed peas, palm oil and pur\u00e9ed onions, deep-fried in yet more palm oil before being sliced open and stuffed with dried shrimp and vatap\u00e1 \u2013 a rich and spicy pur\u00e9e of prawns, bread, cashew nuts and other ingredients. The dish originated in Bahia, in Brazil's north-east, where flavours have strong roots in African cooking. Acaraj\u00e9 is at its best when served piping hot, fresh from the vat of oil, with a liberal dash of chilli sauce. 7. Quindim  Another favourite from Bahia, quindim is a glossy yellow sweet treat made with nothing more than eggs, sugar and coconut (with butter a common addition). Baked in cupcake-sized moulds, the bottom is toasted and golden, dense with grated coconut, while the top is a smooth, firm custard that sticks pleasingly to the roof of the mouth. The name is said to derive from the word 'kintiti' (meaning \u2018delicacy\u2019 in Kikongo, a language spoken in Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola), while the recipe itself was inspired by the Portuguese love affair with egg yolks in sweets and pastries. 8. A\u00e7a\u00ed (pronouned a-sa-ee) Of all the Amazon's fruits, the a\u00e7a\u00ed is perhaps the best known, thanks to its superfood status. Traditionally eaten by indigenous tribes as a source of energy, the hard purple berry is also used in Amazonian cooking as a sauce to accompany fish. A clever marketing campaign in the \u201980s thrust it into the spotlight as the energy snack of choice for surfers in glamorous Rio de Janeiro. Served as a sweet, gloopy, frozen sorbet, sometimes topped with granola and slices of banana, or whizzed up in juices, it can found in every caf\u00e9, bakery, juice bar and supermarket across the country. You can even buy a\u00e7a\u00ed vodka, and a\u00e7a\u00ed beer. 9. Feijoada  One of the few dishes eaten the length and breadth of Brazil, feijoada is a hearty stew of black beans, sausages and cuts of pork of varying quality \u2013 traditionally veering towards the lower end, with trotters and ears all going into the mix. A labour of love, feijoada done the old fashioned way takes up to 24 hours to make, including soaking the beans and desalting the pork. Most Brazilians go out to restaurants and bars to eat feijoada, and it's traditionally eaten on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Rice, kale, orange slices, farofa (toasted manioc flour) and pork scratchings are served on the side, along with a tipple of cacha\u00e7a to ease digestion. 10. Fried bar snacks  Beer, served so cold that chunks of ice stick to the bottle, is the drink of choice in Brazil \u2013 and an assortment of fried foods makes the perfect pairing, be it past\u00e9is (deep-fried parcels of crisp pastry, filled with melting cheese, minced beef or creamy hearts of palm), crunchy batons of manioc or bolinhos (\u2018little balls\u2019, most often made with salt cod). Coxinha (\u2018little thigh\u2019) is another popular choice, made with shredded chicken and mashed potato, shaped like a (very voluptuous) thigh and covered in golden breadcrumbs. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many! My mother is from Barreiras, a city in Bahia\u2019s countryside. My choices are very biased towards the food my mother cooks, when she cooks. Bai\u00e3o de Dois (rice and beans casserole named after a dance):  Even though I\u2019ve written many times that I dislike rice and beans, I actually love this dish. Bai\u00e3o de dois, however, contains a lot more ingredients \u2014 eggs, bacon, lingui\u00e7a calabresa (a sort-of-Brazilian sausage), queijo coalho (a Brazilian cheese) \u2014 and is absolutely to die for. Carne de Sol, mandioca e queijo coalho com manteiga de garrafa (sun dried meat, cassava and cheese drizzled with melted butter)  My absolute favorite from the sertaneja cuisine, this dish comes from the arid landscape of the Northeast and the North of Minas Gerais. The melted butter is an essential part of the recipe! It makes the meat taste less salty and makes the cassava wonderful! Vatap\u00e1 (shrimp stew)  Behold for the food of Kings! You make this stew with dende oil, bread crumbs, cassava pieces and lots, lots of shrimp. I love it when a little bit spicy, but that\u2019s me: most Brazilians are not fond of spiciness. Ambrosia and candied orange peel preserve  Ambrosia is a kind of dulce de leche made after sprinkling some orange juice in a big batch of sweetened milk. The acids in the orange create these clots of deliciousness. You could add some cinnamon and/or clove if you want, but I don\u2019t like it. Ambrosia is perfect as it is. The candied orange peel preserve is comfort food to me. My grandmother on my father\u2019s side (not baiana) was a very accomplished fruit preserve maker. Unfortunately, she passed away after a fall in her house and all the recipes are lost forever. No preserve will ever taste as delicious as the ones she made. ",
