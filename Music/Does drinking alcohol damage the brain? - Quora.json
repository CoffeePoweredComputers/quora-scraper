            "answer_text": "In order to answer this question, we need to think about how me might assess \"brain damage\" in the first place. Had we wanted to assess damage to the kidneys, we could measure their filtration rate and analyze the content of the urine. Similarly, if we had wanted to assess damage to the liver, we could measure certain liver enzymes in the blood, or look at the proteins that the liver makes, as a marker for its synthetic function. The brain, heterogenous in form and function as it is, does not lend itself to such a simple method of assessment. Hence we must resort to less-than-perfect measures of \"brain damage\" if we are to attempt to answer this question. Please note that the analysis below excludes problem drinkers and alcohol abusers. The focus here is on casual drinkers. Brain volume and atrophy We can start with what is probably the easiest measure to accept, namely sheer brain volume. Often, on CT or MR imaging, we can detect atrophy (shrinkage) in different parts of the brain. While such atrophy may occur physiologically with aging, it can be associated with many different pathologies that can underly dementia and is thus a potential measure for our purposes. In 2001, Kubota et. al published the results of an interesting study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.[1] In their study, they evaluated frontal lobe volume using MRI in 1432 'non-alcoholic' participants with varying levels of alcohol intake. As you can see in the graph below, participants were grouped according to decade (to account for aging-related atrophy) and then compared within their age group. Light and moderate drinker were not found to have a statistically significant difference in frontal lobe volume compared to abstainers. In their 30's-50's, heavy drinkers (>350g of ethanol/week) were found to have double the risk of frontal lobe atrophy compared with abstainers.   Cognitive function The relationship between cognitive function and alcohol use is a little complicated. A number of studies have been published that show a positive association between moderate drinking and cognitive function. [2, 3] This \"U-shaped\" relationship between cognitive function and alcohol intake is, however, mostly based on observational data that is full of confounders and thus should be interpreted with caution. An (admittedly earlier) review in Substance abuse had found that, of the studies looked at cognitive impairment and alcohol intake, 31% showed evidence of harm, 66% showed no association, while only 3% showed evidence of benefit.[4] To illustrate the effect of confounders on this association, Corley et. al looked at a cohort of 922 healthy volunteers for whom IQ data was available since age 11.[5] Before adjusting for confounders, moderate to substantial drinking (>2 units/day) was associated with better performance on cognitive tests than low-level or no drinking. After adjusting for childhood IQ and adult social level, \"most of these associations were removed or substantially attenuated\". A small association did remain between alcohol intake and memory and verbal reasoning though the clinical significance of that finding is probably minimal. While 'alcohol abuse' certainly has a detrimental effect on the brain through a number of mechanisms, the effect of light to moderate alcohol use is not as clear cut. There are a number of other ways (cerebral perfusion, glucose utilisation, histologic changes), using which one may conceivably assess \"brain damage\". I will be updating this answer as I come across any relevant studies. References 1. Kubota M, Nakazaki S, Hirai S, et al.

            "answer_text": "When we drink, alcohol goes to our stomach and gets absorbed in the bloodstream. Afterwards, it goes throughout our bodies. Then the liver breaks it down while producing an enzyme, dehydrogenase, that turns alcohol to acetaldehyde, this is why you get a hangover. Then the acetaldehyde is broken down to acetic acid. If you kept drinking, you\u2019ll start getting drunk. Now, after a few glasses you\u2019ll start becoming quite clumsy and maybe light headed. This is when the alcohol starts affecting your brain. Because alcohol increases GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid), which is a neurotransmitter that decreases responses, our movement and speech become a bit impaired. Another thing is that our cerebral cortex is impaired since inhibitory centers there are being reduced at the same time. This is why you\u2019re more likely to be compulsive and do things you wouldn\u2019t even try while sober. Alcohol also increases the amount of dopamine in the reward center, this is why people who drink alcohol are usually happier. And alcohol also has an affect on the cerebellum. It\u2019s why we lose our balance and can\u2019t walk straight. And that\u2019s because ethanol stimulates the inhibitory pathways and GABA receptors and eventually suppresses the excitatory pathways as well as NMDA receptors, so that all the functions of the cerebellum are being inhibited. We know that alcohol stimulates our sex drive because it affect two parts; hypothalamus and pituitary. They both coordinate automatic brain functions and hormone release. Since alcohol depresses the nerve centers in the hypothalamus that controls a person\u2019s sexual arousal\u2026 As well as performance. This means higher sexual arousal but lower performance. Ever wondered why you feel sleepy after drinking a lot? That\u2019s because alcohol, in addition to all those, affect the medulla too. Medulla is the part of the brain that\u2019s responsible for breathing, consciousness as well as body temperature. ",
