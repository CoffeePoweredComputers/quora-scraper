            "answer_text": "Cars dont have headrests!! They have head restraints.And they are not there for your \u201ccomfort\u201d. Their purpose is to restrain your head in a collision. Not just a rear-ender too! If someone runs into the back of you, there will be a likelihood that your neck will be damaged by the impact of the top of the seat back against your neck and the recoil of your head backwards (if no restaint). And if you run into something, the recoil of your body bouncing off the seat belt will likely result in your neck impacting the top of the seat back, again damaging your neck (if no restraint). As for the correct set up, you actually make a good point. The head restraint should be positioned so that when you push your head back against it, the back of your head is against the head restraint on the lower part - i.e. so that your head is forced down rather than up. and must not ever be so low that, in a recoil from a collision, your head could still go back and by leverage, cause neck injury. In otherwords the restraint should fully support your head in a collision recoil. In normal driving, you should not feel the restraint against your head at all! Aim for the restraint too high rather than too low. ",

            "answer_text": "A car head restraint or headrest is actually not designed to rest your head against and relax. It is designed to prevent a whiplash injury in the event of a rear-end collision. It is a safety mechanism, just like a seat belt. Although legal, it is highly inadvisable to remove the head restraint. ",
