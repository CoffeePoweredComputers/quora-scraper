            "answer_text": "Are ironic coincidences messages from angels? Messages don't come from Angels unless they are fallen Angels. Any message that an Unfallen God-sent Angel might deliver, always comes from God. Such Angels do not communicate with humans unless the direction or message comes from God. These messages could potentially seem ironic or coincidental. Such messages never, not ever go against what is already in God's written Word. \"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.\" 1 John 1:4. Mail that you receive, dies not come from the post office, it comes from the sender. The post office is a distributer of the mail. A king sends a courier to give his message to the recipient, it is from the king not the courier. God's Angels are His messangers. Fallen Angels on the other hand are capable of actually giving messages that are from them. Beware seekers in the occult, necromancy, fortune telling, witchcraft, sorcery, magic (excluding magic tricks), astrology, seances, ritual sacrafices, hidden knowledge and secret philosophies, summoning demons, praying to angels, Satanism, transcendental meditation, false prophets and religions, and etcetera, the list goes on. These seekers are very likely to receive messages from Angels, but the messages can have dire consequences for the soul who receives the messages. They could potentially seem ironic or coincidental. They almost always go against what is written in God's Word. As for your question about irony and coincidence the scripture gives a good answer. \"What exists now is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing truly new on earth.\" Ecclesiastes 1:9.

            "answer_text": "Anything is possible, but the concept is much too subjective. I wouldn't build doctrine or make my life decisions based on that basis. First, it's not biblically verifiable. Second, it would leave too many things open to personal interpretation, so how could you confirm that you are drawing the right conclusion from the coincidence that you are experiencing? Third, and most importantly, remember that two-thirds of the Angels are Godly angels, but one-third of the angels are fallen angels who rebelled against God and became demons. Think about it logically for a moment. Do the math. That would mean that even if you could verify that the coincidence you are experiencing is a message from an angelic being; even if you could verify the message itself, and that you are correctly interpreting the information that you are receiving from the coincidence; even after all of that, there is still a 33% chance that the messenger speaking through the coincidence is demonic, and NOT a messenger sent by God. Since there is a 33% failure rate even under the best conditions, that is just too risky of a foundation upon which to rest your decisions. That's highly dangerous, (1 Timothy 4:1; 2 Timothy 4:3\u20134; 2 Timothy 3:1\u20135) If you want guidance you are better off asking God directly for it rather than looking for coincidences to confirm it (James 1:5\u20138). If you ask God directly, you won't receive something bad (Matthew 7:7\u201312). Only act upon that wisdom and guidance that you are receiving which you can verify through the Word. Do not act upon any guidance or message that you cannot verify biblically. The foundation of such a message which you can't verify would be too shaky (Matthew 7:24\u201327). I hope this message helps you. Thank you for your kind attention Brother Miche Lankford ",

They never mock or taunt anyone. But what they do is impress upon the heart good ways to go, they uplift and encourage and strengthen those who are downcast, \u2018\u2019 It is the fallen angels , who have become the complete the opposite of God\u2019s Goodness and Love, they are filled with hate, evil and they will discourage people, and drive them to despair, and doubt the goodness and Love of God. When downcast or discouraged, ask the Lord jesus Christ to help you, ask Him in his Love and Mercy to rebuke this influence around you, ALWAYS PRAY FOR DIVINE LIGHT OVER SATANS DARKNESS, ",

            "answer_text": "Prior to the 6th century BCE, the Israelites and Judahites, along with their neighbours, were polytheists. At that time, forms of monotheism arose. Some forms continued to recognise gods but at lower levels. The Judahites (\u201cJews\u201d) instituted large changes, demoting the lower level as created inanimate objects (sun, moon, etc.) and demoting others to created beings, such as \u201csons of god\u201d which later became angels. So these created angels result from human imagination. Centuries later, the Jews created a hierarchy of spirit beings, including angels who \u201cfell\u201d (cause of Noah\u2019s Flood) and they said that the wars in heaven reflected the wars taking place on earth. As with much of the Jews\u2019 New Testament and subsequent Christianity, these beliefs find their origin in the writings of the 3rd-2nd centuries BCE. So these modern day angels remain figments of people\u2019s imagination. Doug ",

But in my somewhat extensive experience, I have found that Coincidences, or what I like to call synchronicity, have often been the work of angels. It\u2019s just that we often do not take the time to stop and look, so we often miss seeing what happened. This is one key way in which we are often helped. ",
