            "answer_text": "I have the same problems. My husband thinks when he plays music that the whole neighborhood hears, no matter what time of day. And it keeps getting louder.. the best way to get away from it is find something else to do, somewhere else, or simply go switch the breaker in the electric panel. Eventually he'll get the point, especially when you just randomly turn it down on your way through the room ",
