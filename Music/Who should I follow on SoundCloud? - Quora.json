            "answer_text": "My narcissistic self would answer, \u201cMe, of course!\u201d However, I don\u2019t think blatant self-promotion is appropriate on a platform like Quora. I would say that you should follow whom you genuinely like, but whom you follow on SoundCloud is really up to you. Instinctively I would assume you\u2019re inquiring about what artists or bands to follow, but other types of profiles exist as well. There are those who upload (not repost) what\u2019s not theirs. There are those who repost content. There are even spam profiles. Last but not least, there are inactive profiles. Sure, you can ask for recommendations for which artists or bands to follow, which I think is what you\u2019re really asking for, but don\u2019t depend on them entirely. People can choose to recommend what they like to you (which is probably what the posters of the other answers are doing), or, if they know you well enough, they can find what they think you might like. Additionally, SoundCloud will generate what users would consider \u201crecommendations\u201d for whom to follow, which are really just lists of profiles that satisfy certain conditions in the algorithm it uses. I would be surprised if SoundCloud disclosed those conditions, but I would first guess that the output would be based on follower counts, genres of content posted the most, and how much a user pays to get promoted. Regardless, with or without those variables, a formula like said algorithm could never fully emulate human recommendation behavior. I will conclude by reiterating that you should follow who you genuinely like. Follower counts shouldn\u2019t matter, neither should reputations. So what if you find Cardi B\u2019s content catchy-sounding? Maybe you could follow her. Just go with your gut feeling. P.S. Profiles that repost content you generally like, such as those who repost songs of a specific genre, might be worth checking out. They are a great source for new or lesser-known music similar to what you like. ",

            "answer_text": "I have done plenty of research on SoundCloud for quality and frequently updated music. Chances are that your favorite artist isn't on there and if they are it wont be frequently updated. There are plenty of DJs and Dubstep clones, and their remixes can be interesting and homogenous at the same time.  Music is very subjective, but production quality and update frequency are obvious. Here are a few that I enjoy: FlyingLotus, DJShadow, JeremiahJae, Paul Vinitsky, cloud life.. These are some of the best produced electronic/hip hop based artists on my list. My personal favorite is smogman))) (who did an excellent sample remix of one of my trumpet tracks) Tony Johns and PiedPiper update frequently with updated and edited retro tracks. http://www.facebook.com/MishkaNYC and HoodInternet and Club Clique do great mashups with music your friends will hear about months or years later. Soundcloud is an awesome platform for music, and curating a large list of quality and frequently updated music takes time but proves to be the most satisfying social media experience. ",
