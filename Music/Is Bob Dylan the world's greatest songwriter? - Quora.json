            "answer_text": "No. And neither was/is any other great songwriter we can name. By that, I mean there is simply too much brilliant songwriting talent to have come along in our lifetimes, to be able to single out just one, among the masses as THE best of the bunch. We have been fortunate to have seen and heard the likes of Bob Dylan, Lennon & McCartney, Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Brian Wilson, Hank Williams, Tom Waits, Randy Newman, Carole King, Robbie Robertson, Townes Van Zandt, Smokey Robinson, Fats Waller, Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer, and so many others, ALL of whom occupy an extremely rarefied level of songwriting skill and accomplishment that puts them above the \u201cmerely excellent\u201d. How does one compare one genius to another, and by what minutia? You can\u2019t do it. Now don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m a HUGE fan of the songwriting of Bob Dylan. I think \u201cFreewheelin\u201d is one of the greatest examples of the art that ever existed, all the way back to John Dowland. But then, so is Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cBlue\u201d. And Tom Waits\u2019 \u201cRain Dogs\u201d. And Neil Young\u2019s \u201cHarvest\u201d. But hey, if you wanna think Dylan is the greatest, I will absolutely be the last person to criticize you for it. It\u2019s hard not to be so passionate about someone so great, someone who has left such an awesome stamp on the history of songwriting, and who\u2019s work will still likely be covered a couple hundred years from now.
