But remember: Music comes first and theory is a reflection on and analysis of prior/existing music. So in that sense, your question cannot be asked. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. There is no tuning system that can fit a semitone, tone, minor 3rd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, augmented 4th, perfect 5th, minor 6th, major 6th, minor 7th, major 7th within an octave without adjusting the tuning of certain intervals to make that possible. That, in fact, is what all tuning systems are about: which intervals you choose microtonally to adjust. The common assumption of all the historic tuning systems is that the one sacrosanct interval is the octave. In equal temperament (the prevailing western tuning of today), the octave is the only interval that is precisely in tune. ",
