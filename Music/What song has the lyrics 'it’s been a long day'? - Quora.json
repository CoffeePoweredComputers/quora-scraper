Here are the lyrics: It's been a long day without you, my friendAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you againWe've come a long way from where we beganOh I'll tell you all about it when I see you againWhen I see you again Damn, who knew all the planes we flewGood things we've been throughThat I'll be standing right hereTalking to you about another path IKnow we loved to hit the road and laughBut something told me that it wouldn't lastHad to switch up look at things different see the bigger pictureThose were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?Everything I went through you were standing there by my sideAnd now you gonna be with me for the last ride It's been a long day without you, my friendAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you againWe've come a long way from where we beganOh I'll tell you all about it when I see you againWhen I see you again First you both go out your wayAnd the vibe is feeling strong and what'sSmall turn to a friendship, a friendshipTurn into a bond and that bond will neverBe broken and the love will never get lostAnd when brotherhood come first then the lineWill never be crossed established it on our ownWhen that line had to be drawn and that line is whatWe reach so remember me when I'm gone How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?Everything I went through you were standing there by my sideAnd now you gonna be with me for the last ride So let the light guide your way hold every memoryAs you go and every road you take will always lead you home It's been a long day without you, my friendAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you againWe've come a long way from where we beganOh I'll tell you all about it when I see you againWhen I see you again ",

            "answer_text": "What song has the lyrics \"it\u2019s been a long day\"? I've waited a while for this question. Here are a couple of songs with that phrase:  \"Isobel\" by Dido. \"It's been a long day coming and long will it last.\"  \"Christchurch Bells\" by Hothouse Flowers. \"It's been a long day coming, seems like it'll go on\"  \"Sitting on Top of The World\" by The Pogues. \"Well it's been a long day but i don't like to moan.\"  \"Fast Car/Slow Traffic\" by Paul Weller. \"It's been a long day and my head's all gone.\" I\u2019ll leave you with the usual joke. What does a pirate do after a long day? He has some Arr and Arr! ",
