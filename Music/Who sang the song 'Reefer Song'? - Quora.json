            "answer_text": "Not sure which one you are referencing but in the 1940\u2019s I don't know the exact date but the great jazz man and showman Cab Calloway had a big hit with \u201c That Funny Little Reefer Man\u201d. Again not sure of exact date but in that time frame. One other thing..African Americans were smoking weed long before it became popular with young white kids in the 60's and by the way I was a Black Hippie  at the time and we were All TOGETHER as youth in a way that hasn't happened before or since. Artist,jazz musicians and creative people were using drugs way before genera society. Errol Flynn and Robert Mitchum were famous whites who had major career problems due to being busted for marijuana use ,among other things, at a time when it just was not generally accepted or used in http://society.As black people today we laugh at the \u201c opioid epidemic\u201d espoused today because when only non whites were using hard drugs ..Not canibis\u2026 and dying in the street strung out.. NOBODY called it an \u201c EPIDEMIC\u201d. but that is probably another story for an time. Again Cab Calloway \u201c That Funny Little Reefer Man\u201d Thanks ",
