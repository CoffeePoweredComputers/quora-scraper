            "answer_text": "I'd suggest you go the Quora question: \"Is there an alternative to Etsy for buying artwork online?\"  There is a Wiki list, PLUS a lot of responses with many suggestions for purchasing art.  I went to ALL of these a bit earlier this evening, and I can tell you that they are a huge cross-section of opportunities for artists in all ranges of skill from beginner to somewhat above average and all kinds of media to sell their art - from all over the world. There were two or three that didn't turn up anything, but most of them looked pretty darn good, although I didn't spend any great amount of time on any of them.  Some were focused on prints, some on originals, some had crafts, some had multimedia. But gosh, it looked to me like any artist at all could find where they fit somewhere there. Now I will tell you that the \"fast\" part is probably unlikely. I don't know any artist who sells their work online \"fast\". That simply doesn't happen as far as I know. This is still too new. But the only way to find that out is to try, isn't it?  And of course how you price your work will be a huge determining factor in how quickly it sells, no matter where you are selling it - in a gallery, online, or standing on a streetcorner. The lists in the Quora question I suggested do not include many gallery-level artists, although there are a few who are certainly there. Among the websites  I would suggest for sales of gallery artists' works are   saatchi. com,  Art brokerage .com and Art 4sale.com Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of online art galleries these days. Without seeing your work its hard to recommend one. I suggest you search for \u2018best online art galleries\u2019 and spend some time looking at the various sites, reading their \u201cadvice for artists\u201d pages and seeing which might work for you. Then open accounts with just 2 or 3 of those you like the look of. Whichever you choose selling art online is hard work. Be prepared to spend a lot of time photographing and cataloging your own work. You need to write a description of each piece and take several high-quality photographs of it, including views of the back, details, and the work in situ. All of these will need to be uploaded to each gallery. You will need a packaging department. You may need to ship work overseas. Artwork, once sold, is a valuable commodity, and you are responsible for packing it using strong, archival, waterproof materials. You need to protect it from being dropped, kicked and generally mistreated (it will be) until it reaches your customer . This is both expensive and time consuming. You will also need a way to keep track of sales. Be prepared to mark work as sold \u2013 as soon as it is sold \u2013 on every site where it\u2019s listed. This is surprisingly easy to get wrong! However, inadvertently selling the same work twice is a sure way to annoy online gallery owners - be warned! ",
