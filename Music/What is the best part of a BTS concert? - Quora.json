            "answer_text": "Thanks for requesting! Just a note, I went to the Fort Worth concert on 9/16/18 and I was in the pit with general admission tickets. :-) Personally, my favorite parts were: Camping! I waited in line for 30+ hours which sounds like it\u2019d be awful (and parts of it were for sure) but I made a great group of friends and I honestly miss them and surviving the crazy line together! Camping really does just add to the whole experience and I\u2019m super glad I did it.The pre-show fun! They had a DJ outside who played a lot of different BTS songs and everyone who knew the choreography jumped out and danced in a big group and it was awesome to watch and be a part of. It really helped hype everyone up and reminded us that we were going to witness them live soon!Finally getting into the arena and feeling the buzz as all of us excited fans waited and sang along to the music videos being shown on the big screens.THE MOMENT THAT THE ARENA WENT DARK AND WE KNEW THE SHOW WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO START!! The lights started changing and they played some intro music and I was literally jumping and screaming like I never have before lol. Idol finally started and BTS popped up on the stage and it was the most insane feeling to know that I was really looking at the boys I have been obsessed with for so long!!Trivia: Just Dance was one of the most memorable moments of the show for me because I love j-hope so much and this song was my favorite of the new tracks on LY: Answer! Plus, it was the first time any of the boys came to the extended stage (I was third row at the center of the extended stage) and he came so close and it finally hit me that they are totally real and just as handsome and talented and charming as they seem. It honestly felt like a dream and I was definitely screaming my head off during this amazing performance!Other songs that stood out to me were the medley, DNA (my favorite ever and don\u2019t come for me about it!!), The Truth Untold, Tear, MIC Drop, and the encore (So What, Anpanman, Answer: Love Myself). Honestly, everything felt like a blur because it was crazy in the pit plus the whole thing was just so overwhelming, so I really cherish what I do clearly remember of the show!I enjoyed when they\u2019d break from the songs to talk to us a little bit. Even though I didn\u2019t totally understand them at times, I so appreciate the effort they put into learning new phrases for us! They were absolutely adorable when speaking English.Without a doubt, the most exciting part was when the members got close to the edge of the extended stage because they were right in our faces! I still can\u2019t believe I saw these gorgeous boys so up close with my very own eyes. Even though the evidence was literally right in front of me, it still felt fake lol. Of course I wish I got more interaction moments because who wouldn\u2019t but I think they tried their best to give everyone some attention. I\u2019m sooo sure that V, j-hope, and RM looked at me because I kept jumping super high and everyone around me was standing still haha!!After the show, we saw people waiting around hoping to see the boys leave and my friend and I just happened to go to the side of the street with way less people and all the people on our side actually saw them drive away! The van was moving kind of fast so I couldn\u2019t tell who it was, but one of the boys had their window rolled down to give us a last goodbye. I thought it was V but my friend thought it was Jungkook! If anyone knows, please tell me lolEven a week later, the post-concert sadness is STRONG and there is nothing I want more than to do the whole thing all over again :,-( I hope they come back soon because I just have to see them again and I hope everyone who didn\u2019t see them this time around gets a chance to experience BTS live as well!

            "answer_text": "Nowadays, you look around you and the influence of the K-pop boy group, BTS, is hard to ignore \u2013 they have invaded U.S. mainstream music and the GP all over the world. And now, I\u2019m being asked this question. So, I\u2019ll answer it based on my observations of events and news gleaned online and offline. Some readers may not know what BTS is, so you may want to read who they are in my answer about another BTS question. To give you an idea how famous they are, here are some of the awards they have received. If you\u2019re in the music industry anywhere in the world, you may want to get acquainted with their music.   Aside from the phenomenal dance moves, performance, and stage presence, the best part of a BTS concert is the sincere interaction of the 7 members with the fans and among themselves. You can truly observe how they love their fans, called ARMY. Here are examples: \u00b7 In a concert in the U.S., the youngest member, Jungkook, noticed a fan fainting, while he was performing, and he handed his water bottle to the aide to give to the fan. Isn\u2019t that a sweet gesture?  \u00b7 Another incident was when Jungkook whispered to Namjoon to inform the fans not to push each other as they might get hurt.  \u00b7 While V was being escorted inside, and screened by aides, he managed to sneak a peace sign to BTS\u2019 fans waiting outside the building. \u00b7 BTS\u2019 members (Kim Namjoon, Kim Seokjin, Min Yoongi, Jung Hoseong, Park Jimin, Kim Taehyung, Jeon Jungkook) ALWAYS attribute their awards/success to ARMY. Stating that: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be what we are now without ARMYs.\u201d  \u00b7 During their concerts, when they deliver their messages, they always thank their ARMYs for being their \u201cwings\u201d. This is the best part of BTS\u2019 concerts, their sincere desire to show their best performance to their fans. This makes their concerts the best there is. The energy, the intricate dance moves, the soaring high notes, and the phenomenal performances are all evoked because of this desire. You can watch one of their epic LIVE performances in this video. Take note that they dance in perfect synchrony while singing, simultaneously. As a singer, this is tough, but they can pull it through - beautifully!  ",
