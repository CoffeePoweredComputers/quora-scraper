            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A So basically if i mention the word music, you can correlate it with your blood. You have blood gushing in your veins and music in mine. Well, my day starts with a mild trancending music. Basically i tune into any playlist available in spotify. my regular day schedule starts off there. Then wheneva i get free time amidst, even if its just a matter of few minutes. I don\u2019t hesitate to plug my airpods and start grooving moves according to the beat. At eve my laptop and youtube screams its throat out of it. After the hectic day ends, i turn up my lappy and start producing my own beats using FL Studio or either Abelton Live. So after i get tired, and before i go to bed i neva miss to plug in some more fav songs downloaded in my Jio music app. Day ends Off to dreams. Note: In however form it may be, whether rock or jazz, pop or classical, or it may be EDM and many more combinations, I just love music. It relates my past, my present and my future. One good thing about music when it hits you, you feel no pain. Music is what feelings sound like. Signing Off AMIGOS. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Neha, As a student, I use to listen music in the morning after I study and get ready to go school. That makes me kind of relaxed to spend the whole day in my school haha. Also, I listen sometimes when there's nothing creative to do or when I need inspiration to make a new track (I'm a music producer as well). I use Wynk from so long and sometimes I play some popular playlists on YouTube (trap nation, NCS and chill nation. ) hope you understood :) Have a great day! ",
