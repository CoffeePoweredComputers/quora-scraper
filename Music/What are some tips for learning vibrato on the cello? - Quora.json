            "answer_text": "I\u2019m just going to quote myself from one of my answers today. Be certain that you already have a good concept of left-hand technique (released thumb touch without undue tension, pleasant sense of fingertips sinking into the string, proper alignment of your forearm through your wrist and into your hand, etc.) before working at vibrato seriously. Mistaken vibrato habits at the start can be really difficult to unlearn so you want to be careful to start well! \u201cOne of the best exercises that I\u2019ve been shown in my Suzuki Method teacher training for capturing the proper physical action of cello vibrato uses a tennis ball. Place the ball on the fingerboard such that you\u2019re pressing down the D-string. Rest your left hand on top of the ball such that it\u2019s cupped in your palm; don\u2019t let your thumb or fingers touch or control the ball. Bow the D-string and use your normal vibrato technique; it should feel remarkably easy for your forearm to shake exactly as it does for a warm, pleasant vibrato. Place the ball on whatever pitches you need to play and bow them. After a few seconds of practice, remove the ball and play as normal with the applicable sounding finger. Repeat in quick cycles. With repeated practice over time, the exercise should help you to find that easy vibrato movement with less struggle.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I found that before I learnt it, I had to learn and understand the song. A slower and faster vibrato can show emotions if you show them when you play. This can make the vibrato sound natural and beautiful. Secondly don't over do it. All of this will come to you with time and practice. With all string instruments your face is always on show, playing cello your body is Open and on show. If you can use this to embrace the song then the vibrato will be the cherry on the top of a wonderful performance which will hypnotise the audience. Vibrato is feeling more than anything. I hope this helped and good luck with the cello. ",
