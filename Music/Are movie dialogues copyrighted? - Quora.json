            "answer_text": "A movie script, including the dialogue contained within it, is under copyright protection. Mentioning where you took the the dialog from does not protected you from copyright infringement any more than a bank robber would be protected from being convicted of bank robbery by saying which bank he stole the money from. Now, you may use a very small portion of a script -- such as an unidentifiable line of dialog -- without violating copyright, but just how small or how unidentifiable a portion you may use would be up to a judge, should you ever be sued by the copyright owner of the script. You may use copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. But whether you can get away with transforming another work by incorporating it into your own artwork -- such as Andy Warhol did with images of Marilyn Monroe -- that again would be up to a judge to determine. I recommend consulting with an attorney first before proceeding with your plans, especially since you are doing so for a commercial purpose. It is a cost of doing business. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s put it this way, a horse is still a horse whether you face them right or left to take the photo, whether they are in a stable or in a field, and with or without a blanket or saddle. By this example, I\u2019m trying to point out how altering someone else\u2019s work is really trying to circumvent the reality that anyone else\u2019s work is copyright protected. And that all the ways you may choose to alter it to make it not look like theirs really just drives home the point that you are using someone else\u2019s copyright-protected work. Courts no longer recognize a percentage when the idea is taken from someone else\u2019s work. Either it is or it isn\u2019t. And dialogues are copyright-protected. Fair Use allows you to use the words for educational purposes, critiques and reviews, and parodies. So, what constitutes transformative? - changing to such a degree that it has a new expression, meaning or message. That\u2019s often a sticky wicket and hard to nail down an exact okay or not okay. But all issues aside, the bottom line is that the words ARE copyright-protected, so one must tread carefully. You may, or may not be covered by fair use with your intent. ",
