            "answer_text": "Kpop, like everything else, is changing. Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worst, and sometimes it just changes in a direction you personally don't like. Remember, music is subjective. Everyone likes different things and there is no right or wrong for the most part. People keep saying that song X is the best song ever and you have to like it, or song Y is horrible and you should hate it. Why though? I like what I like and if you don't like what I like, well\u2026OK then. Also, since BTS broke out in the US, everyone has a new thing to look up to. Any company will always look for the biggest thing as a target. And that is how they plan and how they make their decisions. Before, being big in Korea was the first thing, followed by being big in China and then being big in Japan. That was how the big groups were succeeding so that was the way to go. That meant the music, groups, styling, everything was planned and make for the East/South East Asian public. And they like a certain kind of content. Korean public seems to like ballads more, so everyone at least tries a balad once. When BTS became big with I Need U, Dope and whatever else was there, the theme of social problems became in fashion and that was what the public consumed more. Japan likes something different, China likes something different. Now, there is the new market of US. The US public goes for something much different than the Asian public. So companies go tht way, because now that is the way to go. All is well, but the 3rd generation has lived through multiple of these style changes. That means a big part of their fans know their old music, before the companies saw dollars flowing, and these fans liked the Asian style of music. Nothing wrong with that. The difference is quite big and many of these groups just quickly jumped ship and changed everything. The problem is that, firstly, they don't do it right, and secondly, the change was too sudden. There is nothing wrong with changing your taste. Also there is nothing wrong with not liking the new style. In my case, I really really dislike the commercial Western music. It's just not my taste. That means I prefer the old BTS songs, old MonstaX songs, old EXO songs (Love Shot is OK in my view, a bad song but they make it great, but everything went down so badly starting with Tempo, in my view). There's nothing wrong with their new songs, nothing wrong with people who like them and people who don't. This is just my taste, I just prefer a certain type of music, and I will always look for that kind of music. The only problem (not entirely a problem, but it is there) with kpop is the idea of fan loyalty. Everyone fights to be a loyal fan and many bring down others with the idea that they are not loyal fans. In my view, you don't really have to be loyal. This is not a marriage, not a deal, it is art. You started listening to them because you liked their songs. Now you don't anymore? OK, great, go look for something that you do like. Some people who like the new style will come and start listening now. Everything is fine. ",
