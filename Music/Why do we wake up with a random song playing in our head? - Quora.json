            "answer_text": "You're driving to work, listening to your favorite radiostation, when on comes Britney Spears' \"Baby One More Time.\" By the time you pull into your office parking lot, you have, \"Oh baby, baby\" running through your head. You hum it at your desk. You sing it on your way to the restroom. You tap it out on the conference table during your morning meeting. When five o'clock finally rolls around, your coworkers are shooting you the evil eye and you're ready to pull your hair out. Why do songs get inextricably stuck in our heads? Experts say the culprits are earworms (or \"ohrwurms,\" as they're called in Germany). No, they're not parasites that crawl into your ear and lay musical eggs in your brain, but they are parasitic in the sense that they get lodged in your head and cause a sort of \"cognitive itch\" or \"brain itch\" -- a need for When we listen to a song, it triggers a part of the brain called the auditory cortex. Researchers at Dartmouth University found that when they played part of a familiar song to research subjects, the participants' auditory cortex automatically filled in the rest -- in other words, their brains kept \"singing\" long after the song had ended [source: Prokhorov]. The only way to \"scratch\" brain itch is to repeat the song over and over in your mind. Unfortunately, like with mosquito bites, the more you scratch the more you itch, and so on until you're stuck in an unending song cycle. There are many other theories about why songs get stuck in our heads. Some researchers say stuck songs are like thoughts we're trying to suppress. The harder we try not to think about them, the more we can't help it. Other experts claim that earworms are simply a way to keep the brain busy when it's idling [source: University of Cincinnati]. Just as there are many theories, there are many names for the phenomenon. It's been called everything from \"repetunitis\" to \"melodymania.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know why, but I do know that listening to a lot of music, a lot is bound to stick in your mind and it has a habit of popping up on often unwanted occasions. Perhaps it leads the brain to pleasanter things instead of incessant worrying. When I hear an interesting song on Youtube, no matter what, I will remember it after listening a few times; then I will find the words, and I will sing it in my mind often enough to become part of me and will pop up at any time, not only in the morning. I do not know Russian, but I do know the popular song called \u201dKatoucha\u201d by heart, having heard it sing by many singers and choirs. I remember most of Handel\u2019s Messiah heaving heard it dozens of times over 60 years ; the same with some operas. At the same time short-time memory is getting to be pretty bad. Sometimes the mind-music prevents me falling asleep for hours. Then I get up and start the computer and do something different. ",
