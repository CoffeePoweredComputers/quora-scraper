            "answer_text": "I dunno what the other respondents were doing, but they clearly don\u2019t seem to have used Garageband. Jesus, why does Quora \u2018moderate\u2019 all my good responses in philosophy and politics but makes me answer base level crap like this? Since the last time I\u2019ve actually used Garageband (I use Logic Pro now), Apple seems to have intentionally locked time-stretching behind the Logic Pro paywall. Garageband is designed to be a lackluster DAW missing many critical features like aux busses, sidechain, surround manipulation and many other features which a typical DAW would have. Time stretching and pitch manipulation using the DAW\u2019s engine is one of such features. You\u2019ll need Melodyne or Autotune for pitch edits in Garageband, and for time-stretching you\u2019re better off finding some other software. If you have Ableton Live Lite (commonly bundled with many hardware instruments) use that, otherwise you\u2019re out of luck, and might have to use DJ software. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. In Garageband the tempo of music can be sped up or slowed down without changing pitch. This is because the recording is digital not analog. This reminds me of the production of The Beatles\u2019 song \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d where two different takes were spliced together. The taped recordings were slightly off tempo and the second had to be slowed down to match the first. The drag in pitch is noticeable if you listen to the vocal closely. This problem would have been solved easily in today\u2019s digital studios. ",

            "answer_text": "I have never used GarageBand, so I have no way of saying for sure, but VLC can do that, Audacity can do that, and you can do the same on YouTube, so I think it likely that GarageBand will be the same. You can only do that on digital recording systems; not on analogue ones. A digital karaoke player will do it, but an older analogue one will not. ",
