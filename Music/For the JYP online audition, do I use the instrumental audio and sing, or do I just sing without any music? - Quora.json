            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re going to be singing a very similar rendition of the song (bc of similarities in tone and vocal ability) and you find it compliments your voice, go for it as long as you can balance it in your submission video (ie: it isn\u2019t too loud or too quiet). If you find you can\u2019t balance your voice to instrumental, you have an extremely powerful voice, or you\u2019re going to be singing a more stylized version, I would recommend just using your vocals. Good luck! ",

After listening your own song, if you think that it is good than sing without music and if you think that you will need musical instruments than you can have one. ",
