            "answer_text": "OK, so i suppose you are auditioning for an entertainment company online basically for vocal position. I will suggest you to not get your hopes high if you are doing an online audition and you do not have a typical asian look. If you do then there are chances but slim. See I don\u2019t know what sort of genre will suit you and your voice but you asked for POP songs, so i will suggest both peppy upbeat songs and slow songs. If by chance there are a few songs which you haven\u2019t heard of then please do listen to them first. Closer (The chainsmokers)Something just like this ( Coldplay and The Chainsmokers)Shape of you (Ed Sheeran)Seneorita ( Shawn Mendes )Sucker and What a man gotta do ( Jonas Brothers)2002 ( Anne marie)Sad forever ( Lauv)Happy ( Pharrell Williams)I like me better (Lauv)I don\u2019t care ( Justin Bieber and Ed sheeran)Rolling in deep ( Adele)Call me baby ( Carly Rae Jepsen)Shake it off ( Taylor swift)Thinking Out Loud ( Ed Sheeran)Fireworks ( Katy Perry)Cardigan ( Taylor Swift)August ( Taylor Swift)Demons ( Imagine Dragons)This is me ( From The Greatest Showman )Fight song and Stand By you ( Rachel Platten )See many of the songs are really tricky but these would be my top picks for pop songs\u2026 by the way you can go for other songs too as long as you have good vocals the genre doesn\u2019t matter. I will suggest a few more songs that go a liitle out of the POP genre\u2026 It\u2019s you ( there are two songs of this name one by Ali Gatie and other by Henry Lau, which is an ost for the korean drama \u2018while you were sleeping\u2019 but is in english.. actually you can go for both the songs, both have a nice feel to them.)Cradles by Sub Urban ( ok this is one of the songs which have a dark theme but you can do a piano version of it.)Pretty Hurts ( by our Queen, Beyonce)Night Changes ( one direction)beautiful ghosts ( Taylor swift)Chandelier ( Sia)Paris ( Chainsmokers)Hymn of the weekend ( Coldplay)Build me up butter cup ( The Foundations.. Now i know this one is like OLD but you can go for like an aesthetic cover with Ukulele or piano which will sound cool and attractive at the same time while you can show off your vocals too.)I do adoreBeautiful People ( Ed sheeran)Lovely and When the party is over ( Billie Eilish\u2026 I think her songs might be good for auditions if you can pull of the vocals nicely.. they are not too loud and not too gaudy either )Can\u2019t help falling in love (Elvis Presley\u2026 another OLD song)Paper hearts and Dear No One ( Tori Kelly)When we were young ( Adele)Watermelon Sugar ( Harry styles)you and me ( James TW)Youth and Fools ( Both by Troye Sivan)Like I\u2019m Gonna loose you and All about That Bass ( Meghan Trainor)The Climb ( Miley Cyrus)Here with me ( Marshmello)Roar ( Katy Perry)Me Too ( Meghan Trainor\u2026 this ones a cool song)One call away, attention, I warned myself, We don\u2019t talk anymore ( Charlie Puth)Believer ( Imagine Dragons\u2026 A nice song to show off the vocal skills)Masterpiece and Bang Bang (Jessie J\u2026. if you have good vocals with rapping skills these might be the perfect songs )Flashlight and price tag ( Jessie J. )Better Place ( Rachel Platten)I personally think you can go for English covers of korean songs but if it is too risky then it is upto you. I think I suggested too many of them but I hope you will find the perfect song for your audition and it all goes well. Best of luck\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to rap they go all American lol. So you might impress with Eminem's \u201cRap God\u201d but if you can't master that fast part like a boss while keeping the flow, then don't do it. Try and find a song that fits your flow. Don't try to master some popular songs just because the artists sound cool. Rappers have different flows and give off different vibes. First try and look for a rapper that inspires you or that has a similar vibe to yours. Then look for a song that he raps. A song with lyrics, good lyrics not this popular shit that has been going back and forth for a few years. Eminem, Biggie, 2pac, Dre, Obie Trice, Ice Cube all of them have different flows and I don't think you have the experience to master all of them in a short period of time. So start looking for a rapper that fits your style. You can check out old Dumbfounded\u2019s songs too. He has a mellow style. And don't forget your lyrics. That's bad. Hope you will do well. Good luck! EDIT: In case you look for some female rapper songs you can try Lauryn Hill and maaaybe Nicki Minaj. I'm recommending Nicki because she has a more bitchy type of flow and I saw a cover on her part from the song \u201cBottoms up\u201d made by Cheetah and it fitted her perfectly. ",
