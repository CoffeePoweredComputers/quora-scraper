            "answer_text": "Such on-the-spot questions sometimes Quora comes up with are really interesting. Here, off the top of my head: I have got a handful.   Trampled Underfoot, Led Zeppelin (1975). Here, a live rendition of it. Gotta love that enthralling clavinet[1] by John Paul Jones.   Shining Star, Earth Wind & Fire (1975). A live version. I have often wondered if this song can be taken as the link of a funk-based band with the rock music, much like Trampled Underfoot as the specular move of Led Zep toward funky music.   Play That Funky Music, Wild Cherry (1976). Do not say you never shook your butt or head when listening to it - because you did listen to it at least a thousand times in your life, didn\u2019t you?   One Of These Nights, Eagles (1975). Their transition from country rock to a heavier edge happened in the homonymous album. There had to be something funk-ish to bridge the gap: One Of These Nights and its high falsetto vocals was the answer.   Niggizz can't sang rock'n'roll, Mother\u2019s Finest (1976). Splendid satire and great combination of heavy riffs and funky gait. I love it!   Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine, James Brown (1970). You can\u2019t possibly leave this one out. There is everything here you need to understand any successive branching of pop music from there on: the syncopated bass line, the obsessive guitar riff, the leading by James Brown, the sudden music breaks. Are you saying this last one is not a \u201crock song\u201d? Fair enough. Your problem.  The funkiest one, in my opinion? I don't know, nor do I care. Let me enjoy all of them.
