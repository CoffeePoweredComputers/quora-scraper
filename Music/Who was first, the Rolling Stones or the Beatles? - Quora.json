            "answer_text": "As others have answered, the Beatles were formed in 1960 and the Stones in 1962. But John, Paul, and George had been playing together several years before in the Quarrymen. Lennon formed the Quarrymen in November 1956; McCartney joined in October 1957, and Harrison early the next year. You could pick any of those dates as the start of the Beatles \u2014 nobody disputes that Quarrymen were a predecessor to the Beatles. Or you could pick the summer of 1959, when a second version of the Quarrymen \u2014 consisting of John, Paul, George and another guitarist, Ken Brown, who hadn\u2019t been in the original group \u2014 helped open the Casbah Club. It was this entity that went on to become the Beatles. The Stones had predecessors in two bands, but didn\u2019t as clearly evolve from either of them. The first was The Blue Boys, which included Jagger, Richards, and original Stones bassist Dick Taylor. It was founded in 1961 and followed an earlier band in which Jagger and Taylor were members . Also in 1961, Alexis Korner formed Blues Incorporated, which the Blue Boys came to see the following March. At the time, Charlie Watts, Ian Stewart, and Brian Jones performed in Blues Incorporated. Jagger subsequently became a singer in Blues Incorporated and Richards sometimes played guitar. Jones, Stewart, Jagger, Richards and Taylor then formed the Stones and played their first gig in August of 1962. Wyman replaced Taylor in December and Watts left Blues Incorporated for the Stones the following January. Blues Incorporated existed until 1966. ",

            "answer_text": "To add to that not only were the Beatles first but they actually gave the Stones their first hit song. I Wanna Be Your Man was written by John and Paul and was the Stones first hit. Legend has it that in 1962 The Rolling Stones bumped into John Lennon and Paul McCartney on the street and mentioned they were desperate for a hit single. Lennon and McCartney followed the Stones into a studio and finished writing the song in the corner of the room while Mick, Keith and the boys waited. \"I Wanna be Your Man\" was a hit for the Stones, but John Lennon would later admit, \u201cIt was a throwaway. The only two versions of the song were Ringo and The Rolling Stones. That shows how much importance we put on it: We weren\u2019t going to give them anything great, right?\u201d ",
