            "answer_text": "It depends on what age they are. Younger children, of preschool age lack the cognitive ability which allows them to recognise other people's goals for them are not the same as what they want. The development of this theory of mind ability is strongly linked with parental mind mindedness, and so the more open you are with your child you are about how different things make you feel the more representations your child will build about themselves in relation to others. This along with continuity of attachment within a stable environment will help your child to learn faster as soon as they have the cognition to do so (around 5-6 years). This is certainly the springboard from which children's want for knowledge could depend later on in life. Children must also be allowed to experience a wide variety of situations in order that they have multiple representations and experiences with how to deal with tolerable stress. If they are not allowed to discover their own solutions to their problems, they will not learn. Sometimes the best way for children to learn faster is to let them experience the natural consequences for their actions without your interference, nagging and griping. No homework = detention. Leaving their bike out= it may get stolen etc etc. Knowledge that they can talk these things through with you and tell you how they feel should facilitate knowledge. Teens are more difficult however, and peer groups are a vital part of learning. At this point it's vital that you allow them to experiment with different things on order that they are able to negotiate stressful situations. ",

            "answer_text": "There are various ways. First, you have to determine within a reasonable range what your child might be capable of learning. Next try to discern what might interest your child. Then try ways to encourage his interest. For instance, I wanted to really arouse my son in learning about volcanoes. So what did we do? We built a volcano that could actually erupt. That was a real cather with my son. He was aided in learning about the action of volcanoes; however, he had to figure out himself (with a ittle aid from me) how we could get a volcano that really explpded. Also, (I\u2019ve written of the before; however, it was really an attention getter and builder of children\u2019s imaginations. One year, I had a very difficult class with which to work. I decided to shock them to some degree. I had three science classes. The night before my introduction to a new study, I carved out three birthday \u201ccandles\u201d made from potatoes. I also carved three wicks from some almonds. When the students entered my classroom the following day for their science lesson, I had all the window shades drawn and also no lights turned on. When they entered the room, I told them immediately to go to their seats for further instructions. The instructions included their writing down every thing they saw in the room and also action taking place in the room in great detail. Then I took out my first birthday candle. I walked down the darked aisles and talked as I do s, stating that they had to write every thing I did in orde for me o test their powers of observation. Then without warning I thrust the candle into my mouth and swallws it. The kids gasped, shock and said, \u201cMrs. Taylor ate the candle!\u2019 By lunchtime, every junior high teache knew that I had eaten the candle by noon that day. When school was dismiss there was a line of kids who wanted to know what had takn place. I told them the answer would come as we worked throughout the year. Also, at the beginning of school year, I had the studens place a pumpkin in a large aquarium over good soil that had dips and high level shaped into it. Then we covered the aquarium with heavy plastic so that there was no moisture that could enter the aquarium. The aquarium was placed by a window that permitted sun. They watch the pumpkin disintregate into nothing while water levels appeared in the brown soil, forming rivers, streams and lakes. After the pumkin had disappear and deposited its many seeds, the student were able to take home in the spring new baby pumpkin plants. I can go on and on; however, I think you get the message that there are numerous activities that you can do at home to encourage your child learn more on his own. You can find many of the these activities on the computer itself. Just type in science activities and the grade level. In English, you can also build up a interest by having him join into activities offered by the library. Of course, you probably already know that reading with him at an early age is a good beginner for introducing him to reading by himself. Also, have him send out special cards to his friends with notes written on them. Take him to a movie and have him relate what he saw in the movie. Have him draw a picture of a scene that took place in the movie. You can hang that picture one the wall in his room. Going to the different museums in your city will also help out. Where I live there is a science museum, art museum, history, and several other types that cater to children. The zoo is also a popular place also.Most kids love doing as many activities as they can. The offering the museums is one you would enjoy along with your child. Have write a short paragraph of what he saw and did. I discovered that just by opening one door you are lead further into opening many more. What a fun time you and your child have ahead of you! ",

            "answer_text": "In many ways you can't really help kids to learn faster, instead, it's more about looking at what you are doing to slow them down. Kids learn quite a bit from their life experiences and so simply exploring new things becomes new learning opportunities. If they don't have these varied experiences, they won't learn. It's not just about going places, it's also about new shape, sounds, and textures. In some ways this is true of babies through adults. however there is higher level learning in older kids through adults in which it's not so much just experiences and now a far more active learning approach. One where studying, for example makes a difference. As kids transition to this phase of learning I think you can maintain that high pace of knowledge acquisition by ensuring that the kinds of learning entry have is stimulating. It is not just about the materials but also how it's introduced. With adults we know that short learning sessions don't tend to work well, we can't teach new knowlege or change behavior in a two day workshop. Worse yet is one that relies on lectures, memorization, and book reading. Adults learn by doing and with continuoing coaching and support after the initial lesson. We don't teach kids with short two day courses nor do we do so much hands on learning with follow up coaching. Why not? It's all beyond me, the research into learning is clear enough and what works well for adults actually works well for kids too, if anything more is needed. You can speed up the learning, so to speak, by working with kids to have active and engaging learning opportunities relevant to the content and to provide ongoing support and coaching for an extended period of Time. Scaffolding takes the notion of coaching and applies it to learning such that we take a person and stretch their ability to a next higher level. We start where they are and work with them to move past that with our support as the coach and teacher. Coaching provides other benefits besides opportunities to scaffold as well, it also can take on the benefit of allowing opportuntiies to positively reinforce and build efficacy in the learner. ",

            "answer_text": "Pay attention to what draws their interest. Get to know who they are as people. Do they like stories? Do they like humor? Do they like hard facts? Do they like to skim the surface of many ideas? Do they like to immerse themselves in one idea at a time? Do they like learning with someone or on their own? Do they like listening, seeing, reading, watching, doing? Humans learn best and fastest when we\u2019re pulling in what interests us for our own reasons. Pushing knowledge on children slows learning and can even stop it. A lack of interest slows learning. Trust that what they\u2019re interested in, even if it doesn\u2019t relate to something adults would use, is important. Video games are problem solving and decision making. Movies are story telling with words, sounds, visuals and music; as well as travel to different times and places. Dancing, singing, cooking, drawing are all ways children learn about the world. Play is children\u2019s version of scientific exploration. It\u2019s how they ask questions and play with answers. Humans are not good at memorizing other people\u2019s understanding of the world. That\u2019s why learning in school takes so long. It works against the way humans naturally learn. And doesn\u2019t even work very well. But when kids are free to explore and make their own connections, they learn much better and faster. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several things to consider, when looking at how children learn the fastest. First of all, there is a sweet spot to find when you are teaching a particular subject. If you aim above what they are able to handle, you have a frustrated child. If you aim too low, you end out with a bored child. Sometimes it takes a while to find that sweet spot where they are interested and capable of grasping the concepts you are presenting. Second, a child needs a great teacher to learn the fastest. It\u2019s not just what you teach, but how you teach it. There is more to explain than we can put in an answer. Last of all, everyone has different ways in which they learn. Some are audio learners, while others are visual. Some people can have something explained to them, while others are hands-on and need to actually do what is being taught. Generally, the more senses you involve, the better they learn. And, teach the material a little at a time and then give them a chance to apply what they have learned in real and practical situations. In order for it to be true learning, they should be able to retain the information, as well as apply it to other situations, as well. ",

I don\u2019t have to think about it but 3x4=12. I can tell you why, but I don\u2019t have to count it all out. Mnemonic devices work very well also, putting facts to music\u2026 that works wonderfully. ",

If you can find time, read the books yourself so you can have an intelligent conversation about the material. Most good book shop staff, particularly academic book shops, should be able to direct you to age-appropriate texts. If he has a question that you can't obtain a good text for, ask here. Amazing what Quorans know! ",
