            "answer_text": "Because you\u2019re unique and smart. Music nowadays follows such a repetitive nature today, they all sound the same. The talent in the industry has dropped immensely, no longer is a song produced from the heart and soul, it\u2019s produced from a computer. Music today is basically only meant for dancing, the only way to be successful is to make music that you can dance to. It\u2019s no longer a progressive art, it\u2019s an art of who can make the most money from the most catchiest song. ",
