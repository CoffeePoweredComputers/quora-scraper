            "answer_text": "Ah, Kate Bush. The leotard nymph. The bad babooshka. The mad companion of hounds. Deciding which of this brilliant woman\u2019s many compositions is the best, is no easy task. I mean, you\u2019d think it would be an easy task. Just yell the name of one of her famous singles and be done with it. Do yourself a favour and don\u2019t think too much about the obvious, right? Wrong. The Bush won\u2019t reveal her true greatness without a lot of trimming first.One simply does not put ones finger in there and point at the obvious choce!An artists of this caliber deserves to be respected and analyzed.It\u2019s what Kate herself did when she drew inspiration for her own songs, so it seems only right that I should analyze her work as well, before I decide which delicious melody of hers brings me the most pleasure. And to do this, I will have to go through EVERY song she\u2019s written.I will judge them as I see fit, and then I\u2019ll collect all the best songs from each album and have them battle it out for the top spot. I will not include unofficial home demo recordings.Nor will I include cover songs performed by Kate, like Elton John\u2019s Rocket Man. This is all about the Bush\u2019s tush. So without further ado, let\u2019s get cracking! The Kick Inside  Moving - Sounds more detached to me. But also vaguely Chinese. Good. 4/5The Saxophone Song - Unique and girly melody, with aggressive sax. 4/5Strange Phenomena - Like a Broadway musical for Chinese toddlers. 3/5Kite - Upbeat and catchy reggae. Filled with playful enthusiasm. 4/5The Man with the Child In His Eyes - Kate wrote it, aged 13! WTF? 4/5Wuthering Heights - Otherworldly. Progressive. Beautiful. Haunting. 5/5James and the Cold Gun - Surprisingly hard-hitting rocker. Not bad. 4/5Feel It - Sorry, I\u2019m not feeling it. This is too girly for me. 3/5Oh to Be in Love - A great song with a not so great chorus. 4/5L\u2019Amour Looks Something Like You - Remarkably mature ballad. 4/5Them Heavy People - It\u2019s a good song. But it annoys me as well. 4/5Room for the Life - This is the greatest song ever written about a womb. 5/5The Kick Inside - Pleasant little ballad to close the album with. 4/5The Kick Inside is a stunning debut from someone so young. Not only are the songs very accomplished, but there\u2019s a consistent \u201cAsian\u201d style to most of them (even the album cover fits this theme) which makes for a very coherent listening experience. \u201cRoom for the Life\u201d is one of the most underrated gems she\u2019s ever written, in my opinion, and I\u2019d love to choose that. But \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d is the obvious winner here. Lionheart  Symphony in Blue - Unfairly ignored single. Kate admits to liking sex. 4/5In Search of Peter Pan -Kate shows us the way to Neverland. 3/5Wow - Sounds like an Elton John Broadway number. Classic. 4/5Don\u2019t Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake - Kate can\u2019t sing hard rock. 2/5Oh England My Lionheart - Slightly medieval, I suppose. 3/5Full House - Progressive rock/jazz fusion. A clear highlight here. 4/5In the Warm Room - Nice and cozy little song. No more than that. 3/5Kashka from Baghdad - It\u2019s fine. Kate sounds bored and uninterested. 3/5Coffee Homeground - Nazi carnival music. Good fun. 4/5Hammer Horror - Fine song. Kate doesn\u2019t sing it very well, though. 3/5Lionheart was unfairly compared with her debut album and was considered a bit of a disappointment at the time. The songs are nowhere near as memorable this time around, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re bad.Once again, there\u2019s a consistent theme to the way all the songs sound.I like to think of it as \u201cautumnal music\u201d or something. And I LOVE the album cover. Hmm, \u201cFull House\u201d is the song I respect the most here, but I\u2019m choosing \u201cWow\u201dbecause I think it has wider appeal to you boys and girls. Never for Ever  Babooshka - A highly sophisticated composition. Impressive and fun. 5/5Delius (Song of Summer) - Delius never wrote something this good. 5/5Blow Away - Like blowing on a psychedelic dandelions or something. 4/5All We Ever Look For - Moving little musical performed by critters. 5/5Egypt - Any song with a \u201cPussy Queen\u201d in it, is immediately good. 4/5The Wedding List - Complex song about a simple revenge tale. 3/5Violin - Having an orgasm in the orchestra pit again, Kate? 3/5The Infant Kiss - Gorgeous melody. Also available in a French version. 5/5Night Scented Stock - Not a song but a short, beautiful interlude. 3/5Army Dreamers - One of the most understated war songs ever. 4/5Breathing - Progressive environmentalist masterpiece. 4/5Kate\u2019s third album feels like the final part of a trilogy to me.The songwriting remains consistently mysterious throughout and the productionis, again, rather \u201cautumnal\u201d to my ears. And the album cover is spectacular. \u201cBabooshka\u201d is the obvious choice here. It\u2019s such a classy song. It has to win. The Dreaming  Sat in Your Lap - Aggressive and pissed off. Furious drums. Great. 5/5There Goes a Tenner - Catchy sky number about scared bank robbers. 4/5Pull Out the Pin - Kate and David Gilmour fight in the Vietnam war? 4/5Suspended in Gaffa - I always love a footstomper, and this one is great. 5/5Leave it Open - Sounds like a Led Zeppelin song in disguise. 4/5The Dreaming - What the fuck did you put on the barbie? 4/5Night of the Swallow - A blues ballad AND an Irish jig? But, of course! 4/5All the Love - Is it about dying and guilt? Who the hell knows. 3/5Houdini - Great song about a foolish man. 4/5Get out of My House - Hell hath no fury like a donkey scorned. 4/5Angry, difficult, complex, bizarre and outrageous, \u201cThe Dreaming\u201d isn\u2019t so much about individual songs as it is about surviving the experience of listening to all of it.Nevertheless, there are a couple of easily digestible moments on it, and chief amongthem is probably \u201cSuspended in Gaffa\u201d so that\u2019s the one I\u2019ll go with. Hounds of Love  Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God) - Hypothetical gender swapping. 5/5Hounds of Love - Utterly brilliant and highly evocative and romantic. 5/5The Big Sky - Just an apocalyptic jam, really. The 12-inch is superior. 5/5Mother Stands for Comfort - Sorry, mummy. I love you. 5/5Cloudbusting - Pop perfection. Arguably the peak of Kate\u2019s career. 5/5And Dream of Sheep - Slowly freezing to death sounds wonderful. 5/5Under Ice - Wait, it sounds like a bloody nightmare!! Aah! Cellos! 5/5Waking the Witch - Well, she\u2019s awake. And you\u2019re on trial for your life. 4/5Watching You Without Me - Somber meditation on people you miss. 5/5Jig of Life - Kate\u2019s the master of the demonic Irish jig. 5/5Hello Earth - Watching yourself drown from outer space. 5/5The Morning Fog - We (probably) survived. But harps are playing\u2026 5/5Commonly regarded as Kate\u2019s masterpiece and one of the greatest albums of the 80\u2019s, selecting a winning song from this beast of an album is no easy task!It\u2019s between \u201cHounds of Love\u201d and \u201cCloudbusting\u201d for me. But since you\u2019re pointing a gun at my balls, I guess I\u2019ll go with \u201cCloudbusting\u201d because it\u2019s the more epic in scope of the two songs, and I find it emotionally overwhelming.Which is always good. The Sensual World  The Sensual World - Suitably sensual and seductive ballad. 5/5Love and Anger - Incredible song with some nice Gilmour guitar. 5/5The Fog - Apt title. The song is like a symphonic fog to get lost in. 4/5Reaching Out - Soulful ballad with some really great singing. 5/5Heads We\u2019re Dancing - May I have this dance, Hitler? Hmm. 3/5Deeper Understanding - Tinder pre-Internet. Better than it sounds. 5/5Between a Man and a Woman - Wow. A boring Kate Bush song. 2/5Never Be Mine - Another lovely ballad. Dreamlike. 5/5Rocket\u2019s Tail - Bulgarian singing gives way to almost demented rock. 5/5This Woman\u2019s Work - If I was a woman, this would be my funeral song. 5/5Walk Straight Down the Middle - Bluesy song with some funny vocals. 4/5Following up something like Hounds of Love is not something that anyone canjust do on command. Not even Kate could come up with something that matched or outdid what she\u2019d done before. But after 4 years, she did release an album that was almost as good, in many ways, and in \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work\u201d she arguably wrote the most beautiful ballad ever written. So I\u2019ll have to choose that. The Red Shoes  Rubberband Girl - The stretchiest pop song you\u2019ll ever hear! 5/5And So is Love - Some truly passionate singing on this one. 4/5Eat the Music - Calypso and fruit. Very catchy and very good. 5/5Moments of Pleasure - Sometimes it\u2019s good to be sentimental. 5/5Song of Solomon - It\u2019s fine, I guess. Nothing special. 3/5Lily - Almost good. Mostly bad. That\u2019s no good. Makes me sad. 3/5The Red Shoes - The old film had better music for this scene. 3/5Top of the City - Lost among skyscrapers, the girl sings the blues. 4/5Constellation of the Heart - Mediocre song. Truly awful. 2/5Big Stripey Lie - Worst song of her career. Nigel Kennedy\u2019s on it\u2026 1/5Why Should I Love You? - Why would work with Prince? Bad idea. 2/5You\u2019re the One - Phew. At least the album ends with a banger. 5/5I can certainly see why Bush would be attracted to the story of the Red Shoes,and why she\u2019d want to make both her own music and film to portray that storyin her own way. But the result wasn\u2019t the best. Some of the music is OK, but it doesn\u2019t suit the story, in my opinion, and Kate isn\u2019t a great dramatic actress, as evidenced byher somewhat absent-minded and confused performance in her directorial debut, \u201cThe Line, The Cross and the Curve\u201d. Many of the songs on the album go hand in hand with the film. It\u2019s all one big concept. So I\u2019m just going to choose \u201cYou\u2019re the One\u201d because it has nothing to do with the story of the film at all. It\u2019s just a wonderful ballad. Aerial  King of the Mountain - Decent reggae song about\u2026.Elvis? 3/5\u03c0 - About as exciting as calculus. 1/5Bertie - Excruciating song about her son. Make it stop. 1/5Mrs. Bartolozzi - Throwback to her early piano days. Washing machine! 2/5How to Be Invisible - You slow down the Beatles\u2019 \u201cGet Back\u201d apparently. 2/5Joanni - Long chords and a lot of mumbling. Some of it in French. 2/5A Coral Room - Boring piano ballad without focus or character. 2/5Prelude - Dove mating calls can be heard over piano. 1/5Prologue - More mumbling. In Italian this time. 2/5An Architect\u2019s Dream - Bossa nova preset on your keyboard is better. 2/5The Painter\u2019s Link - Kate and some dude sing about colours. 2/5Sunset - First listenable song on the album. It has energy! 3/5Aerial Tal - Kate imitates asshole bird. Her son laughs. 1/5Somewhere in Between - Finally a good song. More of this, please! 4/5Nocturn - And more we get! This is funky and sexy. Great bass.4/5Aerial - And we end with what sounds like Kate\u2019s version of rave music. 4/5I can remember being extremely excited when this album was released in 2005, 12 years after The Red Shoes. And I can also remember being extremely disappointed by it. It was Kate\u2019s first double album, and it was just about sunshine and being a happy mother All the darkness was gone. All the passion and mystery replaced with domestic bullshit. And to this day, I can\u2019t fucking stand it. However, a song must be chosen, so I\u2019ll go with \u201cSomewhere in Between\u201d. 50 Words for Snow  Snowflake - Sounds like being trapped with a choirboy under snow. 2/5Lake Tahoe - Well, there\u2019s piano chords in it. 1/5Misty - Wow, drums and bass! This is getting exciting! 1/5Wild Man - The Hakuna Matata choir is jerking off in the snow. 1/5Snowed in at Wheeler Street - Elton John shows up. Poor guy. 1/550 Words for Snow - Stephen Fry reads out a list of words for snow. 1/5Among Angels - Nothing redeemable about this one. 1/5Quite frankly, this is the worst album Kate\u2019s ever made, and if someone else madeit; someone who didn\u2019t have the legacy she has, then I\u2019d demand they\u2019d be shot.Finding the \u201cbest\u201d song on this album is impossible. I refuse.There\u2019s NOTHING good here at all. Fuck this album to hell. Sigh. Let\u2019s end with something more positivie. This Woman\u2019s Work - Volume One  The Empty Bullring - Charming and playful piano tune. 4/5Ran Tan Waltz - Sounds like a drunken, German waltz. 4/5Passing Through Air - Kate trying to sound generic. 2/5December Will Be Magic Again - Decent Christmas song. 4/5Warm and Soothing - Yup, it\u2019s a piano ballad. 4/5Lord of the Reedy River - Pan flutes and mumbling. 2/5Ne T'enfuis Pas - Nice little song in French. Nothing more. 4/5Under the Ivy - Hounds of Love outtake. It\u2019s good. 4/5Burning Bridge - Sounds like a bad demo of \u201cThe Big Sky\u201d. 3/5My Lagan Love - Kate sings a cappella. Sometimes that\u2019s enough. 4/5The Handsome Cabin Boy - A cappella again, except for a synth. 4/5Not This Time - Couldn\u2019t agree more. 2/5Be Kind to My Mistakes - Sorry. Not when they\u2019re this boring. 2/5This Woman\u2019s Work - Volume Two  I\u2019m Still Waiting - Should\u2019ve been on \u201cThe Sensual World\u201d. 4/5Ken - Written for the Comic Strip film of the same name. Bad. 2/5One Last Look Around the House Before We Go - Instrumental. 3/5Experiment IV - This is a pretty haunting song. I like it. 4/5Both of these volumes are part of the same box set, so I will only chooseone song from both of them to represent Kate\u2019s B-sides.And the best of the lot is \u201cUnder the Ivy\u201d. And there we have it. I didn\u2019t include Kate\u2019s 2011 \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut\u201d album becausenone of the songs on it are new. She\u2019s just been fucking around with perfection like some musical George Lucas\u2026 OK. Let\u2019s round up the best songs. Wuthering HeightsWowBabooshkaSuspended in GaffaCloudbustingThis Woman\u2019s WorkYou\u2019re the OneSomewhere in BetweenUnder the IvyYeah, it\u2019s not easy, is it? \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d would probably be a lot of people\u2019s first choice, and understandably so. It\u2019s a classic for a reason. But it\u2019s also TOO obvious.\u201cCloudbusting\u201d is the best song on her best album, so that immediately pushes it high up on the list. On the other hand, \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work\u201d is almost certainly the most beautiful ballad I\u2019ve ever heard, so\u2026 Fuck it. I\u2019m going to have to cheat on this one.Instead of choosing THE greatest Kate Bush song of them all, I\u2019ll choose the bestfrom each of the different genres she usually writes in. Best ethereal pop song: Wuthering Heights. Best pop song: Cloudbusting Best piano ballad: This Woman\u2019s Work Yeah, I know. It\u2019s a cop-out, but how do you choose between 3 perfect songs?They\u2019re all equally important, moving and effective on different days at different times, depending on what mood you\u2019re in.

            "answer_text": "Kate Bush is a supremely talented musician, singer and performer but I feel that her extraordinary ability as a lyricist is often overlooked. She tackles many different themes, each with artistry that other writers could only dream of. Just a few examples include:- Poignancy: This Woman\u2019s Work, The Man With The Child In His Eyes, Apocalypse: Experiment IV, Breathing Revenge: Babooshka Nonsense: Fifty Words For Snow Loss: A Coral Room, Army Dreamers Of course, there are some songs whose lyrics seem so obtuse that I suspect only she knows what they are really about. For me these include Running Up That Hill, Sat In Your Lap, King Of The Mountain and quite a few more. If I had to pick one song that pulled together all of Kate\u2019s extraordinary gifts and vision, AND which took popular music to a place it had never gone before, I would pick Rocket\u2019s Tail from her 1989 album The Sensual World. It still send shivers down my spine more than 30 years after it was first released. ",
