            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve owned both guitars, but it was over 10 years ago. Somethings will have changed, but not necessarily for the better or the worse.. Here is what I know about it- The Alvarez thin body unplugged had an almost dead, midrange sound. It felt pretty decent and played very well. Once plugged in it became a whole different monster with awesome electronics and some came with both Piezo AND condenser mic installed. It could easily cause bass or treble feedback if you cranked them too high. The battery case was a little tough to get opened and closed and it didn\u2019t go in just one way so it was kind of fiddly to replace the battery. The neck was a little thinner and the action was a bit higher than I like so I chiefly used it to play as a slide guitar in open D or open G tunings. But up and running, it was a solid guitar with amazing crispness and sustain. The Ibanez was almost as good plugged in but it had a kind of muddier tone and only the Piezo pickup to run with. As for playing it, unplugged it was a little more bassier than the Alvarez, and a bit louder. Plugged in it had a great tone, was full of treble and bass but not too good in the midrange. I had my bass and treble turned to unity and the midrange up about 30% higher to get a good overall tone. Here is the kicker- The neck was a perfect fit for my hand. The action was a little lower than the Alvarez although the intonation was minutely off, barely noticeable above the 9th fret, which I seldom reached to anyway. I played standard tuning on this one because it fit better in my hands. So, all in all, I like both, but I\u2019d love to have the Ibanez, with better intonation and the Alvarez electronics installed. Again, that was over 10 years ago. The Ibanez was given to a friend of mine who\u2019s equipment was stolen from his house a few years back. He still has it and plays it. I still have the Alvarez but dont play it very often anymore as I have a couple higher end Takemine guitars that are a bit newer and better quality. And that\u2019s what I know about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Alvarez used to be some damned good guitars, I don\u2019t know if they still are or not. Ibanez are decent guitars, but I suspect they, like a lot of their contemporaries, have a strong division between  their quality instruments and price point instruments. If both are made in Japan, you would have a hard time going wrong, same with Korea. Chances are both are made in Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, China or somewhere like that, if that proves to be the case, then it\u2019s kind of a crap shoot. Don\u2019t rule out buying used, look at Craig\u2019s List, E-bay, Reverb and your local Pawn shop. I can assure you a Japanese model of either make is a worthy investment, both are good guitars. Happy Hunting! Robert ",

            "answer_text": "I assume we are comparing the Alvarez Jazz and Blues Series vs the Ibanez Artcore and Artstar Series. High-end Artcore models are sometimes compared closely to Gibsons, but when you compare Alvarez and Ibanez guitars in the same price range to one another, Alvarez guitars tend to sound better while Ibanez guitars tend to look better (even though Alvarez guitars are wonderful looking in general). Then again, all these opinions are subjective, so take them with a grain of salt. ",
