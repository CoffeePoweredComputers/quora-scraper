            "answer_text": "Full disclosure, I am the Business Development Manager for a new startup, an online social musical gear exchange site, NinthBeat at NinthBeat: Buy & Sell Gear. We specialize in affordable used gear and telling a story to go along with your equipment. I worked as a Guitar Sales Manager at Guitar Center for over 3 years, and the people on this thread are telling the truth. First off, people always think their gear is worth more than it actually is- you have to take age, condition, appearance, desirability, and popularity into consideration. One thing that people also forget is, that if Guitar Center sold the piece new at any time, they cannot give you more money for it than it cost them originally to stock it, otherwise they would just get the piece in brand new. Guitar Center also needs to set up the new piece, and that could be either a string change, polish, etc. and that all costs money and salary. Guitar Center doesn't charge any extra fees for selling like most sites, and they do give you a discount on new gear if you're upgrading, which is good. Cash now is a great thing as well. They aren't looking to screw anyone over, but the associated costs, overhead, salary, unknown time that they will have the piece in stock, and many other factors contribute to the offer that Guitar Center gives.

            "answer_text": "You will not get anywhere close to the value if your instrument.   As a dealer, I ( and any dealer, including guitar center) only purchase used instruments or equipment for resale. This being the case, the price they will give you will be what they think they can sell it for, minus overhead, fixed costs, acquisition ( cleaning, rest ringing, repairs, etc.) and profit.    At best, they will offer maybe 65% of there market estimate, which will be low balled.  So, if your instrument sells between $1000 and $1300, the dealer will assume a sale price of $1000 and offer around $650 to you for this instrument.   There are lots of places for you to get a better deal - eBay, Craigslist, and reverb.com.   It us much better than the pre internet days in terms of selling your stuff.    I am always upfront when buying instruments and tell them honestly that they can sell for x but can only offer y.   Consequently we rarely buy anything. ",
