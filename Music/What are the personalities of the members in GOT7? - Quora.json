            "answer_text": "GOT7 is one of the most genuine K-pop bands out there in terms of how they project themselves, the strength of their bond clearly shows everytime they're together and honestly if I were to rank variety content for K-pop boy groups then GOT7 would rank the highest (higher than EXO and BTS, for me at least). Based on what I've seen and known of GOT7 here's how I'd describe their personalities: Jaebum: Genuine, least bit pretentious, will speak the truth, loves his group mates but knows when to be stern, hardworking, a no nonsense kinda' guy, a bit clueless at times.Mark: Not much of a talker compared to others, family oriented, responsible, zero drama, zero pretense, lost in his own world sometimes.Jackson: Loud AF, caring, respectful towards elders, energetic, emotional, family oriented, honest, funny, outgoing, savage (will say out loud what others keep to themselves), when he loves you he shows it with all his heart, a genuine guy.BamBam: Sassy in three languages (English, Thai and Korean), not afraid to spill the beans, a little less loud than Jackson but loud nonetheless.Yugyeom: Emotional guy, cries easily, scared of his hyungs, genuine, loyal, dedicated, will go to any length for GOT7, passionate.Youngjae: a bit mysterious, quiet at times but knows when to be funny, always has your back, loyal, an extroverted guy who leans towards introversion as well.Jinyoung: an intellectual, a man of his word, you'll never know what's cooking in that brain, the wise owl, sarcastic, will insult you but you'll think it was a compliment and thank him for that.Note: idk how many times I used the word 'genuine' in this post, but I truly stand by what I say.
