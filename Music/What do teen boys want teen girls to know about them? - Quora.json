We know other menIf I don\u2019t trust a dude alone with my girlfriend, I have good reason, I sometimes can\u2019t explain it, but I do. (I trust my girlfriend, not the dude.)We are mostly assholesThe ones of us that aren\u2019t are rare and a good find. If you find one keep them (not as a boyfriend per say, but keep them around as a friend)We are scared of you, honestlyYou guys literally have the power to ruin our lives as teenagers (LITERALLY), I for one am so terrified of that. I\u2019ve had rumors spread about me that I\u2019m working on. One accusation (true or false) and we\u2019re sex offenders and our lives are ruined.We can\u2019t read you guys, please tell us what you wantTrying to read you guys is like trying to understand hieroglyphics before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, if you like us, tell us.NOT. ALL. OF. US. WANT. THE. SAME. THING.Some of us are complete whores, yes, but there are a good amount of us who aren\u2019t. We don\u2019t all chase women for their bodies (Personally, i find intelligence more attractive than a hot body).We are really really really really incredibly stupendously astoundingly stupidWe make dumb decisions all the time, don\u2019t be surprised if we do something dumb like dm Dr. Phil asking for the N-Word pass (true story)This goes in with us not being able to read you guys. You could have a sign pointing to what you want and we likely wouldn\u2019t know what you wanted.If we like you odds are we are too scared to tell you.Rejection hurts, if you\u2019re gonna reject us, then do it softly. We\u2019ll carry that for a long time.We masturbate, I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s true. We\u2019re very hormonal teenagers and it feels good. It\u2019s human nature.If we did something wrong, tell us for God\u2019s sake. You have no idea how hard it is to not know what we did wrong because you guys won\u2019t tell us.Well guys, that\u2019s my list of what I want teenage girls to know about teenage boys. thanks for reading!
