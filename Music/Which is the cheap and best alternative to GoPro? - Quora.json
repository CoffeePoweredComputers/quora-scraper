            "answer_text": "If you are looking for the best alternative to Gopro, DJI Osmo Action should be the best option, with its price and features set to grab Gopro\u2019s market share.  Osmo Action costs $349 and Gopro cost $ 399 originally, but had dropped its price a bit to compete with Osmo Action. Osmo Action and Gopro are probably the most eye-catching action cameras in the market. They are similar in many aspects including external appearance, shooting modes and video resolutions. Both can shoot video at resolutions up to 4K60 and 1080p240, and both of them have superior stablization algorithem. But there are two aspects that differ Osmo Action with Gopro. The biggest physical difference is that the Osmo Action has a screen on the front of the camera, too, making it ideal for vloggers.The second obvious difference is that Osmo Action can shoot HDR video , however, this is not available in Gopro yet.If you are looking for a rather cheap alternative to Gopro, Yi 4K Action camera is also a good option.  It\u2019s costs $169, about half of Gopro\u2019s price. It can shoot 4K at 30 fps, and it has a larger touch screen than Gopro. The fixed lens offers a wide field of view and a fast f/2.8 aperture. Though the price is quite attactive, there are still some cons of this action camera you may want to know: The image stabilizaiton is not that competitive than Gopro or Osmo ActionIt\u2019s not waterproofNo voice-controlBut overall, with its price low like this, it\u2019s still a good option.
