            "answer_text": "There are multiple ways to cover a song. To begin, let understand what kind of covers exist out there. Single instrument covers. The first type is the one that involves only an instrument. It can be your voice, a guitar or any other instrument. Sometimes, those musicians use the original song and play over it while recording so people understand what song is playing. You can also make a cover without actually playing the original song. It is mostly the case for pianists and classical guitarists who can play chords. The next video shows a piano cover that is playing over the original song, but could have sounded great without it too.  Drunken Sailor (piano cover) by DavidRussell323 Multiple instruments covers. For that type of cover, you will obviously need to record various instruments. You can play with other musicians or play those instruments by yourself. Playing all the instruments used in the original song is not necessary. For example, if you cover an orchestra, we won\u2019t blame you for not having a basson, a horn, an euphonium and so on. There are plenty of collaborative covers on YouTube like this one :  Green Day - \"Having A Blast\" Collaborative Cover by Far As Hell Covers Digital covers. This third type of cover has a quite large scope. It depends on the type of music you want your cover to be. Let\u2019s say you want to cover a popular band. Maybe you want to turn one of their songs into an electronic cover. There are also people turning songs into virtual orchestras. The basic thing you need are sound librairies. The following video is an example of a virtual orchestra done by the amazing Rozen :  May We Meet Again (From \"Skyward Sword\" Fi's Farewell) by Rozen Audio Mixed types covers. These are not rigid types since you can mix a digital instrument cover with some recordings of your favorite instrument(s). Since I don\u2019t have money or time to record all the instruments of my own covers, I will often put a virtual drum and some orchestral strings to make my mixes more vivid and full. So here is an example of how I do that :  Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Darkness Ridge (cover) by Alexandre Comeau We have two guitars and a violin in this cover. The rest are orchestral elements added to make the cover sounds more \u201ccomplete\u201d. For that reason, we cannot say it belongs to a particular type of cover. It\u2019s as simple as that. ",

            "answer_text": "I am answering this purely from a point of view of a listener, not a musician. As a listener I would like cover songs that are close to the heart of the singer, and not because the original is popular. If you really love the original, your cover will be a lot better. Plus, focus should be on the music and NOT on the video. In the age of most people \u201cwatching\u201d the music rather than \u201clistening\u201d to music, it is easy to fall prey to the temptation of having a good video and the music might get diluted. Also, the music arrangement will play a big role. Too many or too less instruments being used spoils the fun. As a listener, while I must be able to relive the flavour of the original, I must also want to have a couple of cover artists' genuine contribution to the original song. ",
