            "answer_text": "This question is a Trojan Horse. Auto-tune is a studio device (it can be used live only with a lot of effort). Like every technological advance since the electrical microphone, it is not so much a \u201dcheat\u201d as it is a welcome nuance that can enhance the track). In my second Columbia album, I had a song that was almost perfect\u2026only the singer was slightly sharp throughout the whole thing. After many takes, I ended up settling for a less-than-elegant solution by drowning her in echo. I think studio techniques have bypassed the older models, and that we need to incorporate the new into our spatial concepts. ",
