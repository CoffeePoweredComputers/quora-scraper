            "answer_text": "Not only is he a great guiatrist, he\u2019s an excellent musician. He can pick up his instrument and move people. He can go into a studio and put that down on tape. For anyone who\u2019s tried to make something truly memorable in the studio you know how difficult it is to catch lightning in a bottle. He can also step on stage and deliver, in real time, a performance that rocks an arena. Musically speaking, Angus has incredible phrasing and timing. His playing grooves so hard. Sure, he\u2019s using mainly pentatonic scales with the occasional flat 5 thrown in for Some blues flavor. But man, what he does with that simple palette is genius. His bending and vibrato are also incredibly expressive like a voice. Dude plays his ass off! ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously Angus Young is an excellent blues/rock guitarist. He has command of his instrument, a wonderful sense of dynamics, timing, momentum and crescendo. In tandem with his brother and bandmate Malcolm, for 30+ years Angus was half of one of the greatest rhythm/lead guitar duos in rock history, with more killer riffs to their credit than any ten lesser bands. For years, I have half-jokingly said that Angus Young was the result when Chuck Berry was possessed by the devil. ",
