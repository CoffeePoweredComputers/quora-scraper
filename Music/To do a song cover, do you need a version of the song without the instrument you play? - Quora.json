            "answer_text": "If you mean to do a song that already exists with your own band, right? If you are a singer, probably it would be easy to you that you can practice using karaoke tracks and you can be ready to practice with your band anytime. When you play an instrument is a little bit hard, because is not easy to find a track of the song without the instrument you want to use, and also, is gonna be annoying because you will hear all the noise anyway! As a bass player, my method to learn an existent song is: Get the song in a viable way to hear it anytime (downloading the song or add it to a spotify or youtube playlist)Get the music sheet, or at least the bass tab from songsterr or ultimate guitar.Hear the song and read the bass tab at the same time to get an idea how the bass is working.Play the bass along with the bass tab so I can get an idea of the groove.Play the bass along with the song in order to improve timing.Finally playing it with the band.My disadvantage is when I get this groove, I am not able to think on the other parts of the song, I mean, I cannot sing while doing the bass part at the same time.

            "answer_text": "Kind of a confusing question; I guess I\u2019m wondering what you mean by a \u201ccover.\u201d Most people who do covers either listen to the original and learn the part by ear, or read it from a chart, or (most often) some combination of both. It sounds like you\u2019re talking about something like a Music Minus One format, which was a popular learning tool in the vinyl days. The short answer is \u201cno.\u201d You would only need such a version if you are doing a live or recorded presentation in some kind of an instrumental karaoke context. ",
