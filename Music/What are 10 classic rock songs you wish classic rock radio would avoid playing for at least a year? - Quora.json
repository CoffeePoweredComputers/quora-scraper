            "answer_text": "A bit of fascinating background here. Lee Abrams, whom I worked with at the Chicago Tribune, was largely responsible for picking the artists you hear repeated ad nauseum on classic rock radio. Lee used to be one of Sam Zell\u2019s radio hotshots when he owned Jacor Communications. The other, Randy Michaels, gave us ultra-right talk radio. As executives for Chicago\u2019s Tribune Company, both were miserable failures who left in disgrace for sexual indiscrepancies, though not with each other. The sad part is otherwise great bands and albums from that period (The Pretty Things, Four Seasons in their experimental period, the Association, Three Dog Night) did not make Abrams\u2019 cut and rarely get played on classic rock (or is that Jurassic?) rock radio. And so, the songs. Ban them not for a year, but 10, to return as re-recorded klezmer favorites, sung in Yiddish: The Who, \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again.\u201d Anything from \u201cWho\u2019s Next,\u201d really\u2026 but this finger-to-the-establishment song is now anything but. Close your ears and you can hear the coda, followed by a Viagra-popping, toupee wearing Boomer deejay singing its praises for the 1,453rd time. In a smug voice.Close second: \u201cCan\u2019t Explain\u201d 2. Pink Floyd, \u201c\u201dMoney.\u201d Don\u2019t gimme none of that goody good good ultra-heavy-rotation-playing bullshit. Close second: \u201cAnother Brick In the Wall.\u201d 3. Led Zeppelin, \u201cOver the Hills and Far Away.\u201d The next Jimmy Page riff after \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d that we should ban pimply teens from playing in music stores. Close second: \u201cBlack Dog\u201d 4. Rolling Stones, \u201cHonky Tonk Women.\u201d More cowbell! More cowbell! More fucking cowbell!!! Close second: \u201cSympathy For the Devil.\u201d 5. Crosby, Stills and Nash, \u201cCarry On.\u201d How about \u201cCarrie Anne\u201d by Graham Nash's Wimpy former band, The Hollies? For a change. At least the steel drum solo would make me spit out my granola. Close second: \u201cSuite: Judy Blue Eyes.\u201d Honorable mention: \u201cOur House,\u201d Graham Nash. Number one uncontested winner of the Pussy Whipped Rock Song of the Millennium. Imagine the woman in the song yelling at Nash to take out the goddam trash, and Nash cooing back \u201cYes dear! Oh yes dear!!!\u201d 6. The Hollies, \u201cLong Cool Woman In a Black Dress.\u201d The Hollies had only one hope of being cool, and that\u2019s after Nash left. Still a great song, but getting to the point of Earworm Central. And just try making out the lyrics. \u201cI toll ya gonni SPID coz ya gonna be sid.\u201d Huh? Close second: \u201cBus Stop\u201d 7. Bad Company, \u201cShooting Star.\u201d Shoot the deejay instead. Johnny died one night and it was from this song TAKING OVER HIS BRAIN. Close second: \u201cRock and Roll Fantasy\u201d 8. Eddie Money, \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise.\u201d The former Eddie Mahoney was a cop, and he should arrest the programming director for highjacking. I\u2019ve got a surprise especially for you, but it\u2019s not the song coming on the radio. The most thinly veiled attempt at a Macho Man\u2019s Plot to Launch a Weekend Sex Marathon. Go borrow the deejay\u2019s Viagra, pal, you\u2019re gonna need it. Close second: \u201cTake Me Home Tonight\u201d 9. Billy Joel, \u201cPiano Man.\u201d Billy Joel doesn\u2019t get the kudos he deserves, mostly because people wrote him off as a wimpy balladeer. So what does classic rock radio do? It takes one of the really great songs he wrote, and ruins it for everybody. Close second: \u201cCaptain Jack\u201d 10, Bruce Springsteen, \u201cBorn to Run.\u201d The next time you hear classic rock radio try to destroy this song, drink 15 beers (or root beers, if you prefer). Then sing at the top of your lungs in your best Jersey accent, like an African bull seal in heat, \u201cI WANNA DIE WITH YOU WENDY IN THE STREET TONIGHT IN AN EVERLASTING PISS!!!\u201d Close second: \u201cBackstreets\u201d or anything off \u201cBorn In the USA\u201d Please please please try instead: \u201cKung Fu Fighting,\u201d \u201cGod Save the Queen,\u201d Stretching Out In a Rubber Band\u201d or \u201cBlitzkrieg Bop.\u201d Then again, they\u2019re not Plastic Rock. And I\u2019d rather have them to myself/ourselves anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah. I call it my \u201cBands That Are Past Their Expiration Date\u201d list. Led Zeppelin - Fantastic band, lots of amazing music created\u2026 But if I hear Stairway one more time\u2026 The Who - Was a time in my life when I, influenced a bit much by my peers, did in fact like The Who. Saw them in concert in 1982. And they put on an amazing show. Excellent show band. Alas. Classic Rock Radio has ruined them forevermore. John Mellencamp - Hold on. I don\u2019t hate him or his music. But I think maybe all of his hits have been beaten to death on the air. Rush - Dear Lord, how I hate Rush. Spare me. Bob Seger, \u201cTurn the Page\u201d - it was a heartfelt song in its day, exuding\u2014no, oozing all the misery of touring. Not to mention forshadowing \u201cDead or Alive\u201d by Bon Jovi. Another one bites the Classic Rock dust. Pink Floyd - No. Just no. Billy Joel, \u201cPiano Man\u201d - I\u2019m just sooooo sick of it! Elton John, \u201cCandle in the Wind,\u201d both versions - I just can\u2019t. It was lovely, but the grammatical error has always driven me nuts. Neil Young - Gag me with a spoon. The nasal voice\u2026 Bleechh. But I do love the song about \u201cflying Mother Nature\u2019s silver spoon\u201d\u2014much better by KD Lang, though. And oh, Lordy, no. More. Doors. While I\u2019m sure that the interminable and infernal organ solo in \u201cLight My Fire\u201d is a delight when you\u2019re stoned, no no no, I don\u2019t smoke it no mo\u2019. (No, that\u2019s not ten songs; I don\u2019t follow directions.) And here are a few that I can listen to over and over and over: Lynyrd Skynyrd, \u201cFree Bird\u201d - yes, really. Fight me. Lynyrd Skynyrd, \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d and a bunch of others. Again, die mad about it. Tom Petty - any and all. Love me some TP & the HBs. The Hollies - If they get played, I\u2019m there. Love their harmonies and Beatley sound. Boz Scaggs, The Police - presented without comment Joe Cocker - any and all, especially live. And finally, my guilty pleasure, Guns \u2019n\u2019 Roses - yes, really. I am too old and too sophisticated (ahem) to like them, but, Oprah help me, I do. ",
