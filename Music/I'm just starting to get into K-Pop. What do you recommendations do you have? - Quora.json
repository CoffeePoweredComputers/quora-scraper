            "answer_text": "Trying not to be biased you should listen to some of the common K-pop songs of different groups and go towards the group that you gravitate to or feel attract to. If its hard for you to handle so many members then go slowly or pick a group with less members or even a soloist. Personally you should go with BTS. From what Ive seen everyone starts from here because they release a lot of content in different languages,especially if you're familiar with the language english. They have english parts in most of their songs and subtitles in most of their content and videos.(they just started to add subs in their channel as well) BTS has a looooot of content that you can start. Not only is it a good place to start, once you fall in love with them you'll know you're home. The content plus the content provided by ARMYs is huge and you can start anywhere. If you're up to date you get something new ever minute and there are a lot of ARMYs you can interact with plus ARMYs are always helpful teaching you stuff, making art and theorizing everything. BTS also has a lot of songs and they have a wide variety of it so you can find a song you'll like WITH the subtitles. All of the songs are meaningful as well and that can PERSONALLY help YOU because they are just that amazing. For songs: you can start with some famous ones with mvs like fake love, or black swan(ITSNEWANDITSAMASTERPEICE) or mic drop and decide what kind of music you're into. Then you can go deeper slowly into the older songs like blood sweat and tears (King) or spring day (queen). Then further back into danger and NO. You can do this with any kpop group, listen to their new songs then go into their older ones. Then you can go to the songs that have no mvs but are much talked about and performed. Anpanman, Mikrokrosmos, Ddaeng!, From there you can listen to songs that ARMYs have listened to and you'll get the hang of screaming random words that don't make any sense xD Other Songs: TWICE: Fancy, Feel Special Day6: Shoot Me PSY: New Face Stray Kids: Hellevator, Double Knot TXT: Run Away Winter Flower You could also listen to covers that korean artists have done with english songs to get used to their voices or english songs they have performed Fools: RM and Jungkkok (Cover) Winter Bear: V 2U: Jungkook (Cover) So yeah, Im not saying the songs Ive listed are the best of K-pop but what you should start with according to my experience!

            "answer_text": "I recommend anyone trying to get into K-pop to listen to PENTAGON. They are among the best vocals in KPOP, rivaled only (for boy groups at least) by SM vocalists (two of them were SM trainees). Their rap is also varied and unique, and they have tried many concepts with their dancing, from fast to powerful to chill or really bright and young. They're also all very multi-talented, with many of them having additional skills in music production, rapping, singing, acting, and MCing. Here are my personal favorite songs:        . . . . . . I'm also partial to Stray Kids. They're incredibly talented, and might have the top 5 best rap lines in KPOP atm if not the best. There's good variation of tone and vocal colours and the difference between rappers is distinct and pleasing to the ear. Plus, the lyrics are very socially aware, esp for the post 90s generation, and the music is just Good! Some of my fave songs are:   Lastly, MONSTA X. I'm kinda tired so I can't explain why you should stan other than that they also have one of the top 5 male rap lines in KPOP atm, and their music is similar in tone to Stray Kids though it's not speaking about societal problems. Some of my faves:     ",
