            "answer_text": "Hundreds! Besides the instrumentalists (those who actually pick up the instruments and play on a recording) there are still literally hundreds of jobs. Although many famous artists in music (I.e. John Lennon, Kurt Cobain, Trent Reznor) act as singer-songwriter-instrumentalists, this is not always the case with faces in music. In today's music industry, most hits are not in fact written by the artist who performs them. If they do help, they usually have a team of songwriters to help arrange instruments and write music- often these songwriters cannot play instruments (often they will know how to play piano) but understand how to write a hit. Songwriters like this are paid millions for getting a hit in the top 10 in a country\u2019s charts. Session musicians are people who are extremely talented (skilled) on their instrument but do not necessarily play in a band or write music. Instead they are hired for a good sum to come and record instrumental parts for songs written by other people- Jimmy Page did this before he founded Led Zeppelin with Robert Plant- and are often employed to give a song a virtuosic edge. Music producers, mixers and master-ers are people who don't write music as much as they put it together well (although in many cases they will be given songwriting credits on an album for advising the artist). Even the most talented songwriters will often not know how to mix music well enough for it to be commercially viable- so people with these jobs make sure all instruments sound right in the mix (desired sound quality and volume so that nothing sounds unpleasant and no instruments are drowned out) and also do things like \u201cdouble tracking\u201d (telling the musicians to play a section on an instrument or sing a section more than once before putting those tracks over each other). These people may have no instrumental ability but are essential in crafting a slick (or equally abrasive!) album for commercial release. This is just in the studio. There are still people at record companies to think about (marketing teams that advertise the band\u2019s or artist\u2019s material, executive staff that run the record company as any business is run). There are also people who manufacture equipment (instruments, mics, speakers, mixing desks etc). Hope I got everything! ",

            "answer_text": "Ehhhh\u2026.. I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re talking about as a performer. So here goes. Yes, with a big asterisk. On the one hand, as many here have noted, it\u2019s easier than ever to get your music heard as you no longer need a record label. You no longer need to wait around waiting to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d. You don\u2019t even need to ever have an actual physical product. The problem however is that you\u2019re competing with a billion other aspiring musicians. Tons of people on youtube, on facebook, soundcloud, waiting to be\u2026well \u2026.\u201ddiscovered.\u201d At the same time, this country just doesn\u2019t have the same interest in music that it used too. You have probably seen the question \u201cWhy aren\u2019t there any more big rock bands like Zeppelin and Floyd anymore?\u201d on Quora. It gets asked roughly every other day. (I\u2019m exaggerating. A Little.) But other genres are fading too. Straight up R&B/Soul has fallen off the map. Radio used to be able to sustain a variety of genres, but not anymore. In the early 90s country music and hip-hop started taking bigger and bigger market shares of sales. 25+ years later, country and hip-hop are almost the only two genres that appear to be healthy. Even as there\u2019s more music being made, the market is shrinking. There are of course a ton of bands still out there, but many of them are still working day jobs. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a \u201csmall print\u201d band. (i.e., a band that appears at a popular festival but they\u2019re in the part of the promotional poster that you need a microscope to read.) That band is probably working steady gigs, doing better in some cities than in others. They\u2019re getting nothing from streaming, nothing from sales, nothing from merch* and are basically dependent on word of mouth and critical buzz. Some members may have gigs in wedding bands or, more likely, djs. (DJs are cheaper, naturally.) (*Side note: When\u2019s the last time you saw someone wearing a T-shirt from their fave artist? I NEVER see kids these days wearing Drake or Taylor Swift t-shirts. When I was a kid, we guys wore Iron Maiden and Metallica t-shirts like it was our job. And girls wore Wham! and Madonna shirts or whatever. But I don\u2019t see that anymore.) Someone who works at a Wal-mart or drives for Uber is are probably making the same (or more) than most musicians are today. So if you want it, go for it. You will be climbing uphill however. ",
