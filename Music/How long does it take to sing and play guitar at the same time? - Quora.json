            "answer_text": "I find this an interesting question. One of my friends and I have encountered vastly different experiences and have had this discussion many times. I have come to believe that it is a matter of how we perceive the relationship between the singing and playing. For me it is difficult to play consistently if I am not singing. It seems that I cue off the lyrics to time my playing and the nuances of the song change the way I play my guitar from note to note, bar to bar and phrase to phrase. My friend comes from a concert band background, and the music seems to stand alone for him. The lyrics are just an added complexity. In the 5 plus years that he has played the guitar his guitar playing has gotten very good, but he is unable to play and sing at the same time. He can sing when I play and he can play with me when I sing, but he cannot play and sing at the same time. If you struggle with playing and singing at the same time. I would suggest listening to the song many times to build a relationship between the lyrics and the music in your mind, sing along if you can. Then learn to play the song until the point where the playing is almost automatic and only then would I add the singing. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you are rhythmically and musically. I've been in orchestra for 6 years and decided to take on the guitar 2 years into it. I was able to sing right away as I played but I couldn't when it came to piano, it took me longer. It's easier for people to sing when strumming with a pick since you do not need to focus as much with the right hand except strumming pattern. But if you are talking about finger picking, it's more difficult. It all depends on the song (the difficulty), whether or not you can multitask, and focusing on everything equally rather than one thing (most people won't realize their mistakes that way). If you are finding it difficult, try easy songs. Most common pop songs today have very simple chords. I suggest using ultimateguitar.com and find songs that you may have heard on the radio. Look out for the easy major chords rather than power chords or minors. Then start working your way up when you start finding it easier. ",
