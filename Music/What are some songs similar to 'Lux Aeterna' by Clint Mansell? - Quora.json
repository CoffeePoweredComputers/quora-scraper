            "answer_text": "It'd be worth looking into trailer music - a somewhat obscure genre that consists of short, < 5 minute \"cues\" filled with huge brass sections, choirs and drums to create the drama and beats trailers feed off of. For example, here's With Great Power by Immediate Music:   See: Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End (2:10ish)   The Simpson's Movie (1:15)   If you're just diving into the trailer music scene, here's a few artists to look out for, and some Lux Aeterna-like pieces from them: Immediate Music - Electric Romeo - http://tinysong.com/xGObX-Ray Dog - Gothic Power is a remixed version of Lux Aeterna, made specifically for the Lord of the Rings - http://tinysong.com/Ec0oTwo Steps From Hell - Love & Loss -  Audiomachine - Nordica (build at 1:18) -  Future World Music - Aqua Vitae first hit the public in a Battlestar Galactica trailer - http://tinysong.com/fpDCThese cues aren't available to the public except in rare situations, so most of these samples are of relatively low quality - in most cases, 320kbps is on the low end for this kind of music, but I think the ones I found get the point across!

            "answer_text": "Lux Aeterna is a beautiful song. Two other songs that are very similar in symphony are \u2014 Shadows(Unicorn Remix) - Unknown Error Tony\u2019s Theme (Scarface) - Giorgio Moroder Similarity in both the songs is based on the haunting notes. The sweet melodious repetitive tune that is dark and beautiful. What I love about all three is that they can be used as a lullaby, for the not so calm mind. ",
