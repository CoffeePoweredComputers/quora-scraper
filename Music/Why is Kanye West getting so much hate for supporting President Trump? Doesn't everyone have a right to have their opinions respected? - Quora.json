            "answer_text": "Anytime a black entertainer goes against the typical hollywood liberal narrative in politics, he gets hate from the other celebrities. While it might be career suicide for those in show business to publicly support Trump, Kanye is successful enough that he probably will not lose any business over supporting Trump. Some might say it makes him a topic of conversation for a few news cycles and that type of publicity could be useful if he has a new album about to drop. I was never a fan of Kanye West\u2019s music and i don\u2019t even find him to be particularly intelligent when i see him speak in public, but i have a new found respect for him since he has bravely shown himself publically to be a free thinker politically. He\u2019s also exposing the hypocrisy of it all since back when Trump was not president, he was universally admired and respected by the black community among rappers, athletes and black leaders. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Spike Lee and others used to always pose in pictures with Trump like they were close friends. Trump\u2019s name would be frequently mentioned in rap lyrics. Now these rappers and black leaders that use to like and admire Trump, these hypocrites take every opportunity to publicly call the president a racist because its the only way they can stay relevant in the headlines. They just parrot the false media narrative of Trumps a racist and their audience of millions after hearing this so much just accepts it as the truth even though the facts do not support this. I think its quite possible that Kanye, like many Black Americans, was able to realize that Democrats do not do anything to help the Black community, and Trump is the first president that actually wants to help the black community. Trump was never known to be racist before he ran for president. He has promoted many black women within his own company, he dated a black woman, and he funded Jesse Jackson\u2019s presidential campaign in the 90s. I suspect that many black democrats do not really believe that Trump is racist, they just need to continue that narrative because if the truth ever came out, and now that Kanye an influential black man supports Trump, many black people would stop voting Democrat. A recent Rasmussen poll said the Trump has 35% support from the Black community. Joe Biden keeps making insulting public comments about Black people and he was a chief architect of the crime bill in 1994 that put millions of Black Americans in prison for years for minor drug crimes and Biden was also closely associated with segregationists in congress. The Democrats want to create a world where not everyone\u2019s opinions are to be respected. They want a world where only their opinions are facts and if you don\u2019t agree you do not deserve to live and you should be attacked and shamed. You can already see everyone dismissing Kanye West as being mentally ill. Instead of intelligently talking about why he supports Trump, his black democrat friends immediately assume there is something very wrong with him. Meanwhile there is plenty wrong with being black in America these days and supporting Joe Biden on the basis of policies alone. Biden thinks Black people are a monolith and if you don\u2019t vote for him you ain\u2019t black. Perhaps Kanye is making a statement to prove Biden wrong and hopefully other black Americans will wake up and follow suit, ",

            "answer_text": "I disagree with many answers. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, because that\u2019s what an opinion is. Someone\u2019s personal perspective on an idea or topic. However, I think Kanye\u2019s opinion is rather ridiculous and let me explain why. If you look at the demographic overview of Trump supporters, you will notice that less than 7% were black. You really have to ask yourself why is that? Well, if you follow any type of news outlet, you would understand that Trump is not for minorities. He does not support racial diversity. He does not support the LGBT community. Kanye West is undeniably black. I just don\u2019t understand why a black man would support Trump. He goes against your very existence. It actually shocked me that he would even say that he supports him, for what exactly? He sold people who look up to him, people who found him a role model for a man who oppresses people of the same skin color. Trump basically empowered racists to roam the streets. Racism has gotten worse in the USA because of this man and Kanye supports him. Trump belittles women and assumes they are nothing but a fuck-able moving vagina. He says things like, \u201cwhen you are famous, they\u2019ll let you do anything\u201d and \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, and yet\u2026 Kanye is a father of two daughters. Trump is against the LGBT community, and yet his in-law is a transsexual. He is against immigrants and yet, Kim K. is part Armenian. Trump boldly attacked NFL players for refusing to kneel during the national anthem. Kaepernick was standing up for black Americans. He put his entire career on the line for people. That\u2019s a noble and honorable man and Trump slammed him over and over. \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\u201d - Kaepernick And yet, Kanye supports a man who openly attacked Kaepernick for that action. What does that say about Mr. West? Let me tell you - and mind you, this is my opinion. Kanye West is a money driven man. He gets an instant boner when he smells money. He doesn\u2019t care for his fans or even people of the same color. He only cares for cash. Kanye stated that he wanted to run for president and i\u2019m not going to beat around the bushes. He simply wants to ride Trump\u2019s tip into the elections. So, what are my final thoughts of this man? Completely delusional. ",
