            "answer_text": "The way I see it, it really depends on your determination. No one can tell you if you should or not. It\u2019s up to you, and whether you can handle the burdens (including heartbreaks) that come with entering the kpop industry. And I will tell you now, the kpop industry is brutal. I will tell you straight from the shoulder, with no sugarcoated words or uphemisms that you have a very slim chance of making it. Especially in the big 3 (Jyp, YG, or SM). Koreans, non korean asians, and even half Koreans themselves already have a small chance of making it in even the smaller entertainments. Imagine how it will be like for someone with no asian descent? Yes, unfortunately race matters. It\u2019s called Korean pop for a reason right? (I know Korean is not a race) And I am not at all trying to imply that people with no korean or any other type of asian descent cannot be beautiful. It\u2019s just that Korean standards are harsh. As well as talent, entertainments also look at your physical appearance. If you do not have \u201cKorean\u201d or \u201casian\u201d physical features, or if they find you unattractive then you will most likely not be accepted. I know it\u2019s blunt, but it is reality. Now to give you a little bit of hope: There have been previous foreign, non asian kpop idols that have debuted in the past but sadly, did not make it very far (I know not very encouraging) but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way for you! Like I said, it takes determination! You never know how things will turn out so don\u2019t give up on your dreams right away when people try to bring you down (including me). Always jump for that opportunity because if things do not work out, at least you know you tried. Good luck and I hope you reach your dreams. ",

            "answer_text": "It's difficult to say, at this point. The K-pop industry is beginning to debut more half-Koreans and Asians from different countries. Slowly, but surely, diversity will be the main selling point for K-pop. Have we seen any progress for non-Asians? Hardly. We all know what happened to Alex, an African-American, from BP Rania. She became a part of the changed lineup in 2015, performing with the group as a member until 2017. However, she was constantly excluded from group activities and content. The company cited \u201cissues with her visa\u201d as a reason for her absences. Unfortunately, these absences were so frequent and scandalous, Alex left the group and returned home to the United States. She has since been releasing content as a solo artist. Will non-Asians have more chances to shine in five years? Ten years? Twenty? Maybe. But chances are very slim for them. You have to remember that South Korea is a conservative country. As representatives of the general public, they are the first to know about K-pop group lineups or new members. They may or may not perceive foreigners positively. Racism and discrimination against other races and ethnicities in the K-pop industry is not uncommon. Whether you agree with this or not, I have to say it. Most people (those internationally) listen to K-pop because they expect Asian singers and performers. Non-Asians don't cross their mind. If they did, they would be thinking about EXP Edition, an all-American \u201cK-pop group\u201d who doesn't have a single Asian member. Were they able to perform on Korean music shows? Yes, absolutely. Were they fully accepted by the general public? Er\u2026 not really. When you see and listen to that group, how does it make you feel? Does it help you envision a bright future for non-Asians in K-pop? For many, the future looks bleak for them. People have denounced EXP Edition from the K-pop industry, saying they don't \u201cbelong\u201d in K-pop. \u201cAsians can't succeed in the American industry, so why allow white/non-Asian Americans to become a K-pop group?\u201d These are what non-Asians will continue to read if they were ever to debut today. The dialogue on this matter may change in the future, but I don't think it would mean accepting foreigners in an Asian entertainment industry. It's a divisive issue, after all. There's not exactly a conclusive answer to this question. ",

And I can't understand arguments like \u201cbut white people can success in Western music\" because it's not the same. First of all, I will compare two industries. Western Music: Always commercial.Suddenly becoming similar to reggaeton.Dancing is not important.The styles are TOO DIFFERENT. It's hard to find something which is not \u201cbadass\" or \u201csexy\", even if each artist/group has their own essence.It's really hard to be successful during a lot of time, mostly you just have a successful single and later nobody would remember you.And now, K-Pop: A huge variety of styles.Takes parts of some other industries without sounding they all the same.Dancing is really important most of the time.Not always commercial.If you're in a good company and people love you, you can be succesful for a lot of time.Can you see the difference? Some people want to live doing music, but you can't always fit the industry you're meant for. Also, literally nobody tells Asians not to get into western music. Racism exists, of course, but I'm sure that there wouldn't be a lot of hate if an Asian artist debuted there. Cultures are not the same, but you can't say it would be impossible. Now, let's give an example. Imagine you are the CEO of a western company, and you reject Asian people because \u201cthey're Asians, and this industry is for giving opportunities to white and black people. Asians can debut in K-Pop industry\". But, what if this Asian person doesn't feel comfortable in K-Pop industry? Will you force him/her to do it? Well, the same for white people. You're separating people because of their nationality and race. Think about it. Yes, yes, I also know that the \u201ck\" of \u201cK-Pop\" is because it's from Korea. So what? It's because the music and the culture is from Korea, but there are foreginers and you don't really care. They're mistrated? Yes. But, if you don't change your mind and protest when you see something unfair, you won't change anything. Please, open your f****** minds. Seriously. I think I will finish there. Fight me if you want, but I won't change my mind. *Don't hate me if I've had any mistake. English is not my first language. ",

            "answer_text": "I am Chinese and I have nothing against non-Asians becoming K-pop idols. There have been so many non-Asians (at least half) joining the industry in recent years that I have honestly become quite used to it. I have also never really thought much about it when I first heard of Vernon from Seventeen (2014/2015) until it became such a big topic in 2020 (mostly because of KAACHI and LANA). I\u2019ve seen some people referring this \u201cissue\u201d as cultural appropriation but I DISAGREE. Hear me out, not everything you do that\u2019s not of your original culture is cultural appropriation. I think this word is too frequently misused especially in the entertainment industry. A non-Asian wanting to become a K-pop idol is not appropriating. It is similar to how Asians are striving in the Western music industry (look at 88rising), these performers just want to expand their artistry in a different part of the world. It is a dream, an experience. There is nothing wrong with it. If foreigners are accepted by companies and are given training just like any idol out there regardless of race and nationality, there is nothing wrong with these foreigners debuting in the K-pop industry. In the future when more representatives debut, it will become more normalized and I hope that will happen ASAP because this shouldn\u2019t be an issue in the first place. (HEADS UP TO THOSE FAKE TRAINEES OUT THERE) On the other hand, if you are not properly trained like everyone else with the same dream and CLAIM to be a K-pop idol/trainee, this is appropriation, because you\u2019re claiming a title that you have not worked hard for. These people have just disregarded ALL the training , ALL the blood, sweat and tears trainees have to go through to become an idol. THESE PEOPLE should stop and start educating themselves. I know cultural appropriation isn\u2019t really part of the question but I just had to get it off my chest. I may not be completely correct so if anyone has anything to add or disagrees with me, feel free to comment and we can discuss and learn from one another. Be respectful (: ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my two cents from another thread. Xintien Pei's answer to Is it possible for me to become a K-pop idol even if I'm a Hispanic? That would be almost impossible, unfortunately. The K-POP industry is quite homogeneous. As an idol, you have to be atleast partially of Korean/East Asian descent to debut. The trend among the few mixed idols also seemed to be half-caucasian half-asian e.g. SEVENTEEN\u2019s Vernon, I.O.I\u2019s Jeon So-mi. The whole ethically Korean/East Asian thing is also true for K-POP idols who weren\u2019t even born or raised in an Asian country. Think of GOT7\u2019s Mark and f(x)\u2019s Amber, I doubt that they would have debuted as an idol if they were entirely of another race. Yeah I know, the whole process sounds racist. But the concept behind this is actually standard across all entertainment industries. The main goal of any business is profit - so What\u2019s the best way an entertainment can appeal to its customers? The answer will probably be finding someone the target group can relate to. And, considering that the entertainment business is heavily dependent on visuals, the easiet way to achieve that would be to match the audience\u2019s physicality, since that\u2019s what most people notice first. K-POP has long since been marketed as having a korean-ish image. The industry also mainly promotes in Asia. These conditions unfortunately limit prospective idols into a very homogenous group. Even Hollywood displays a toned-down version of these racial-selective bias. Don\u2019t believe me? Ok. Just think of how many caucasian hollywood stars you know. Now, try comparing that to the number of well-known African-Americans/Latinos/Asians in the industry. Add that to the fact that America is generally a racially-diverse nation, in oppose to Korean\u2019s culture that is considerably more singular. One could easily see why there is virtually zero non-asians in the K-POP industry.  TL;DR. As of 2016, there is little chance that a non Korean-ish person would succeed in the k-pop industry. Though I think that you could still become a singer in Korean, just not in the traditional \u2018idol\u2019 sense. Footnote: Wow, this turned out longer than I expected. Sorry for any grammatical mistakes, I\u2019m not a native speaker. Edits and comments would be much appreciated. ",

            "answer_text": "The easy answer is not really? Anything is possible and there have been a very VERY few select non-Asian individuals who have debuted as Kpop idols. But the more complicated answer is yes, you have to be at least half East Asian and look it on order to be an idol. Keep in mind, these companies are trying to form K-pop groups, as in KOREAN pop groups and looking the part is just as important as performing the music. Korea in general isn\u2019t very fond of foreigners coming in and essentially \u201ctaking jobs\u201d from netizens. It was only about 15 years ago when the first foreign Kpop idol debuted, Super Junior\u2019s Hangeng and for awhile, he had to perform on stage with a mask to conceal the fact he wasn\u2019t korean. Nowadays, companies have started debuting groups with foreign members as a marketing tactic to make global outreach easier and further. But that has mostly been exclusive to foreign members of East Asian Descent particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Thai. There are a few idols who are half Asian like Seventeen\u2019s Vernon, Samuel, Momoland\u2019s Nancy, and Jeon Somi, but they are half Korean and have Asian features so they don\u2019t stick out too much. Anyways, while there are no specific rules saying you have to be Asian to become a trainee, most of the time, companies seem to only select East Asians to become trainees. Especially the larger companies since they all seem to have a specific \u201clook/vibe\u201d they go for. Sometimes a smaller lesser known company may take in non Asians because they\u2019re desperate enough and having a non Asian May bring attention to the group. Like I said earlier, out of the hundreds of groups of idols, there have only been a select few non Asians who\u2019ve made it to debut. The most prominent example would be Rania\u2019s Alex. She had a small music career going in the US when DR music basically recruited her to be a new member of the group. They essentially used her as a prop to bring attention to this failing group and it kinda worked for a little bit. The members of Rania were good to her and they got along fine, the company on the other hand, treated her like crap. They left her out of a lot of promotions, giving excuses like \u201canother schedule opportunity\u201d even though we never saw her do anything. They left her out of the first music video she recorded music for. When they did allow her to perform with the group, most of the time, they\u2019d have her walk out on stage, rap her part, then walk off or stand in the corner. There was only 1 comeback when they actually included her in the choreography. Eventually, the company decided they couldn\u2019t use her anymore and just kick her out of the group. She didn\u2019t ask to leave or anything, they just made an announcement saying Alex wasn\u2019t part of the group anymore. Aside from her there was a Russian girl Sophia in the group Oh My Jewel and a French girl Olivia in The Gloss, neither group lasted more than a few months before disbanding. So to wrap things up, technically no, you don\u2019t have to be asian to be a Kpop star, but your chances are very very very very slim. You\u2019ll probably have a better shot at becoming the leader of your country than a Kpop Star if you\u2019re not East Asian. ",

            "answer_text": "I see so many questions about non-Koreans becoming KPop stars. I see the superficial allure, but anyone who really drills down on the industry would likely be dissuaded. The process of \u201cbecoming a KPop Star\u201d is not just a matter of showing up and passing a lucky audition and skyrocketing your way superstardom and vast wealth. As a child, you need to have talent. You need to take specific types of classes from specific instructors, and IF YOU\u2019RE GOOD at this point, you MIGHT get signed to an agency. So at this point you\u2019re into your tween-aged years, LIVING IN SEOUL, taking dance and voice lessons, getting your teeth and nose and chin and whatever fixed, and your agency is sending you to auditions at the entertainment companies. Listen to the stories of Hwasa and Weein of Mamamoo when they talk about taking the train into the city to go to auditions. Trying to keep their school work up. Trying to keep their agency, parents, teachers, and each other happy in the process. It\u2019s BRUTAL. Companies will flat tell you every day that you\u2019re too fat, too \u201ctan\u201d, your eyes need fixed, you sound like an angry cat and dance like a clumsy cow. Then you take the train back home, and hope you hear from the agency for another audition tomorrow. Oh, and this isn\u2019t Mr JYP giving you fatherly advice BTW - these are choreographer\u2019s assistant\u2019s interns or some other total flunky who has life and death power over your career. IF you somehow become the first KPop Idol from Bedfordshire or Kentucky or Carabobo - that\u2019s after passing at least one of those auditions, spending years in exhaustive training with the company, and enjoying the very rare event of a successful debut. If things are going \u201cOK\u201d, you\u2019re making $20,000 to $60,000 per year - as much as if you\u2019d started out at McDonald\u2019s, and worked your way up to store manager (NOT THAT THERE\u2019S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT). You've got 10\u201315 years invested into a career, at the expense of everything else, and you\u2019re now semi-famous in an industry few can remain successful or even popular in for as long as 10 years. Yes, of course there are KPop millionaires. But dig into the stories of Hyuna, the girls from Twice, or your favorite idols. It\u2019s a long hard road to get there. Ask yourself whatever happened to\u2026 the girls from Icia, the girls from D-holic, 2 of the 6 girls from Dalshabet\u2026 the myriads of those who \u201calmost\u201d made it. (watch the TV show \u201cThe Uni+\u201d to hear some of the stories) NOW, ASK YOURSELF THIS: If you truly believe that you are TALENTED enough to be in your favorite KPop group - WHY NOT sing and dance and \u201cbe an idol\u201d right where you are? If you have a great voice, use it where you are. the whole world loves music, it\u2019s everywhere - and watching pretty people dance is probably not going away. Self production has made it simple to produce studio-quality music anywhere with a laptop. the internet allows you to collaborate worldwide. Need some beats? Jump on craigslist and buy some. Everything you need is either at your fingertips, or within your own means of production. [1 in every 8 Americans is making music in some way] I would argue that you\u2019re more likely to be successful, or at least make a living, or a profitable hobby with your music in your own country than somewhere else. Superstardom is a tough ask anywhere in the world - why make it harder by moving to another country when you\u2019re 11? ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is probably very unpopular, but I hate it when non asians become K-pop idols. I really couldn't care less if they were poc or white. Non asians could always go into the western music industry.Most of the non asians wanting to become a kpop idol are usually KoreaboosThe western media has always been racist and stereotyping kpop and Asian idols in general. Seeing non asians who are generally the ones being racist towards Asian idols trying to enter the kpop industry makes my head hurtThere have been non asians debuting as kpop idols, but I daresay the only reason we know about them is because of their skin colour (Lana, EXP edition). There are hundreds of other Asian idols and trainees who are talented and skilled but will never get the same amount of exposure because of their skin colourI'm sorry but non asians doing aegyo is just cringe. My friends and I (all asians) heard there was gonna be an American remake of strong woman and all of us immediately asked, how are they gonna act cuteEven though there are non Korean idols, they are still of Asian heritage. I really enjoy kpop because its something I can connect and relate to. Some idols bring in their culture and heritage into their performances (OMG\u2019s Destiny stage where they incorporated traditional Korean outfits and style of music, NCT127\u2019s Winwin performing Chinese traditional dances, G-idle\u2019s Queendom stage Minnie started their Latata performance with a Thai narration)",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: yes, though there may be some issues and obstacles. Long answer: it\u2019s possible, but it will be really hard. A big \u201cdecision-maker\u201d would be whether you speak Korean or not. If you don\u2019t, it will be even harder to make it than if you do. Also if you do make it and you don\u2019t know Korean, you will have to take classes to learn it, and that can be difficult for some. Another issue would be whether you fit Korean beauty standards. I\u2019m not going to go into the nitty-gritty, but they tend to like a more \u201cinnocent\u201d looking face, which is also a reason why haters like to say the boys look like girls- because they kinda do. The biggest issue you will ever face,though, will be the extreme training and nearly overloaded schedules. If you think you might get even the slightest bit homesick if you don\u2019t get to talk to your family often, and by often I mean once a week, then I wouldn\u2019t even try. You will be miles away and won\u2019t have much time to see or talk to your family AT ALL. You also will be pushed to and past your limit during training, and if you aren\u2019t th\u00e9 desired weight when they weigh you(and they will), you may be put on a diet, and those can sometimes be dangerous to your health. And lastly, being a trainee is EXPENSIVE. Once you\u2019re in Korea, you will have to usually pay for food, clothing, and sometimes even housing, and none of those are going to be cheap. You won\u2019t be getting paid by the company you\u2019re in for these either, which makes things worse. So if even after reading all this, you still want to go through with trying to be a non-Asian kpop idol, by all means, do it. But if any of what I just told you are things you wouldn\u2019t want to do, you might want to rethink your decision. ",

            "answer_text": "i personally don\u2019t like the idea of non asians being kpop idols. you see many whites, blacks, hispanics/latinos auditioning, wanting to become kpop idols. my question is why kpop ? i know a lot of people who audition or want to become an idol just to meet their idols, of course not all people are like that. however, you could make a group that dances, sings, raps, etc., in english or whatever language your country speaks, and still be living out your dreams. you could easily gain fame in the states, for asians that is not the case. the western media has been stereotyping asians for decades and now with kpop, those stereotypes are being broken. the western music industry has barely any asian representation. i don\u2019t know a single asian-american singer in america that is as successful as someone like billie eilish. as an asian-american, growing up i\u2019ve never really found a place where i could relate to any artists, there was never a personal connection, but i finally have. the kpop industry is where asians can shine and show what they can do and what they are capable of, when other races want to do the same, you take that away from asians. the hate towards a non asian idol is brutal, all that training and hard work will seem like nothing compared to what the people will say and comment about their race. i\u2019ve seen other opinions saying that a non asian idol could help their group gain international fame, true, but agencies/companies could also find asians who speak italian, spanish, german, etc. let asians have something for once. this is just merely my opinion, feel free to disagree but at least be respectful about it. byeeeee ~ ashley ",

            "answer_text": "\ud83e\udd14 I\u2019m not sure what I think about it to be honest. There\u2019s a lot of non-Americans active on the US market, and it\u2019s not weird. For example, Adele, Anne-Marie, Zara Larsson, Bj\u00f6rk, Harry Styles, Lorde, Sam Smith, and even Justin Bieber. Also, a lot of aspiring artists dreams of making it in the US one day. So, why would it be weird for non-Koreans to dream of making it in Korea? I think a big difference is that the US market has always been the midpoint for the global market. Fame of an artist on the US market is also on a much higher scale than fame of a artist within say a Scandinavian country. So if you aspire to be a big artist with the same amount of fame like Beyonce, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Post Malone, etc. your only real option is the US market. The US is also very multicultural whereas South Korea is, well, not. Westerners are constantly exposed to the US culture, just like Asians are exposed to South Korean culture, mostly from K-pop. So, I think it\u2019s only natural for westerners to aspire to make it on the US market, and for Asians to aspire to make it on the South Korean market. Maybe I think it\u2019s a bit weird when non-Asians aspire to be in K-pop. I totally understand the intrigue of K-pop as I\u2019m a K-pop fan myself. K-pop is unique and awesome and isn\u2019t anything like we have in the west. The production, the sound, the visuals, the fashion - it\u2019s all really cool and different. I guess, what I don\u2019t get is why non-Asians feel the need to categorize themselves as K-pop. I mean, what is the reason they want to be in the music industry? Is it just so they can call themselves K-pop idols? I think I feel confused why they feel they can\u2019t produce the kind of music they want or be the kind of artist they want to be if they aren\u2019t in the K-pop category. Artists like the ones I mentioned before (Adele, Anne-Marie, Zara Larsson, Bj\u00f6rk, Harry Styles, Lorde, Sam Smith, and Justin Bieber) don\u2019t categorize their music as American anything. They\u2019re just artists producing the music they want to produce. I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone. This is just my opinion, but I\u2019m open to changing it. \ud83d\ude0a\u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "As a Korean I really laugh a lot at the non-Korean Kpop fans who try to gate-keep the racial stock of idols in the Kpop industry. One thing that frustrates me is that non-Korean Kpop fans seem to think that all Mongoloid/Indo-European East/SE Asia have some sort of collective ownership and credit to the Korean music industry and popular culture. To us Koreans, idols like Momo (Japanese), Lisa (Thai), Tzuyu (Taiwanese), Sorn (Thai), Sana (Japanese), Cheng Xiao (Mainland Chinese), etc. are just as foreign as Lana (Russian).  Lana who was a Russian trainee debuted and created quite some controversy. While I agree with the controversy regarding poor quality control and obvious accusations of white privilege, I disagree with the buzz around her for being a \u201cculture vulture\u201d and how non-Asians can\u2019t rightfully be in Kpop.  Meanwhile Lisa (a Thai idol) is an extremely popular idol outside of Korea (particularly in Thailand and the West) and has never faced such backlash or controversy. If Kpop fans aren\u2019t willing to accept foreigners in Kpop, they should at least be consistent in their xenophobia. If you want to preserve Kpop\u2019s immaculate ethnic stock so much then disparage idols like Momo, Sana, Lisa, Tzuyu, Cheng Xiao, Lay, etc. the same way you do for KAACHI and Lana. This type of double standard ties back to a racist sentiment pervasive in the West that really bothers me: that is, the generalization of Asia. Most Westerners seem to think that East/SE Asia is some type of big happy family with a shared common culture and ethnic stock. In reality, we all have incredibly strong national identities and all have our own respective cultures and histories. Hence, Lana being an idol makes me feel the same type of way in which Momo is an idol: nothing. However, one important thing I should point out is that when I refer to \u201cWestern\u201d ignorance, I am not referring to a certain racial group. Instead, I\u2019m blaming pretty much anyone outside of Asia of this sort of ignorance. I never understood why or how one could find the motivation to uphold another ethnic group\u2019s achievement as if it were your own. For example, if Japan\u2019s football team were to win the World Cup, I wouldn\u2019t be jumping up and down thinking that this is some collective victory for the \u201cAsians;\u201d instead, I\u2019d see it as a victory achieved by the country of Japan and nothing else. Not only is this over-generalization of Asian cultures and histories annoying but it has actual consequences. Racial policy in the US towards Asians have long been targeting East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans); as a result, Southeast Asians have experienced increased marginalization and exclusion from the political narrative. Hence for the Kpop fans who think white or black (non-Asian) idols have a lesser right to be in the industry than forsay a Japanese or Thai, I\u2019d like to tell you to first off, erase your double standards, and secondly, educate yourself on basic geography.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very unlikely. I am not sure if you have noticed, but foreigners alone tend to receive harsher circumstances - and they\u2019re Asian. The real question is; Why do you need to be a k-pop idol? America, and other countries, have their own industry; usually with less discrimination and harsh circumstances. People generally that are non-Asian, have an ulterior motive as to why they want to join the Korean pop community. So, let me walk you through this with my honest opinion, as a Korean myself. If I join \u2014 entertainment, I\u2019ll get to meet my idol. First of all, an idol can be met at a concert, there\u2019s no reason to aspire to be a Korean artist for that reason. Second, it\u2019s very uncommon that trainees get to meet the higher-class idols for awhile. I know because I passed onto become a JYP trainee; however, after personal issues, I needed to return to my family. You will not meet your idol as just a trainee, most likely. They like to keep those privileges separated. I really like the culture! You can enjoy a culture without trying to incorporate yourself into it somehow. In America, if I said I liked African culture and tried to pursue it, I\u2019d be called all sorts of names because I am not African. I have no direct tie with the culture, and therefore would not be considered an admirer. If you\u2019re wanting to be part of the K-pop industry just because you enjoy the music, or you really like the men/women, then you should continue to enjoy it. There are other industries that you can pursue, though. The truth is that the industry doesn\u2019t really like too many western foreigners. Look at the amount of hate that Seventeen\u2019s Vernon gets for having a mother who is European. ",

            "answer_text": "Does anyone remember this guy??  Chad Future. Wow isn\u2019t that a throwback?! Somehow, I stumbled on this boyband called Varsity Fanclub on Youtube literally forever ago and one of their members was friends with this guy and they had done collabs. So I clicked on a few and discovered that he was a \u201cK-pop\u201d artist which kind of confused me because he was quite American. Definitely born and raised in the US (Detroit), spoke mostly English in the few videos I had seen, and did all English covers of original K-Pop songs.   The MV he filmed with NU\u2019EST member Aron was made in LA (though Aron seemed excited that it was in the US rather than Korea). He also did a collab with VIXX\u2019s Ravi so he was certainly well known enough to make those kind of connections. Even got himself a spot on MNET America/KCON\u2019s Youtube channel.   While writing this post I found out that he considered himself more K-Pop \u201cinspired\u201d than a full-on K-pop artist. (Though many links on youtube and on Google suggest that he\u2019s an \u201cAmerican K-Pop artist\u201d.) His (concert) performances included K-pop style backup dancers and when looking at some of the original MVs you can definitely see the K-pop \u201cinfluence\u201d and the Used2Be MV includes an Asian love interest.  Hate to say it but I don\u2019t really like the whole \u201cinspired\u201d thing in this situation\u2026.Feels like a nicer way of saying \u201cripped off\u201d. Here\u2019s what would have made it a little more authentic for me (personally) if he really wanted to be more \u201cK-Pop\u201d: Trained under a Korean based entertainment company (small or big)Attempted to learn and practice Korean (even though it is complex) so that the covers were more realistic than 100% English/translations and could interview on Korean programs/showsAttempted to learn and train for the dancing components and not just using backup dancers to get the aesthetic.Lived in Korea most of the year (during the career and not including like tours and such)I think what was so off-putting to me was this fusion that just didn\u2019t feel authentic. Not to mention some things he\u2019s done are just\u2026 well\u2026 I\u2019ll let you decide:    Why is this even relevant in 2020 you ask? Apparently there\u2019s a comeback on the horizon  Basically, I think for me, it depends on the authenticness. Don\u2019t try to rip off K-pop aesthetics and cheat your way there, but also don\u2019t be all Koreaboo either. Respect the culture, the people, and learn about how the culture\u2019s history/values influenced the music to where it is today. I think why I had such a problem with non-Asian performers (that I\u2019ve seen, which is like basically 2) compared to foreign Asian members was because the non\u2019s (that I\u2019d seen) seemed less genuine and more so doing it because it was trendy. Apparently there are a few non\u2019s though that are actually doing it right so good for them :) And despite all, what I think really doesn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things! I\\For K-pop it\u2019s really up to how Koreans respond to it, I\u2019m really not in much of a position to argue or impose my ideas on how they should take it. (Also, all of this is just personal opinion, no hate! Be safe guys!) ",

            "answer_text": "Hm, I don\u2019t really know actually. Living in America, it\u2019s hard to find Asians role models in the music industry (or in basically any pop-culture) stateside. For me, at least, it\u2019s nice to have a genre where instead of seeing no Asians, they\u2019re all Asians. It\u2019s also great to have this wave of popularity in America that is supporting an industry that is built by and consists of all Asians. While it would be interesting to see, I hold K-pop close to my heart because it is one of the only genres where I can see people who look more like me (but like 10x prettier lol) and THE only place where I can see a piece of my own culture reflected in the media. Having non-Asian idols might dampen this appeal, but as it hasn\u2019t really happened yet (I don\u2019t count EXP Ed.), I don\u2019t know. Also the fact that Asians have to work extremely hard to gain any fame outside of Asia plays a large role in how others may react, as it seems a little \u201cwestern-washy\u201d and two faced to not accept Asians in a foreign domestic market (let\u2019s use Germany as an example), but then expect to have the people of that market (non-Asian Germans) represented in Asian media. You might say, \u201cwell, there\u2019s not many Asians in Germany, so there aren\u2019t a lot of calls for representation or roles made for Asians.\u201d But there\u2019s also very few Germans in Korea\u2014 can you argue that they need their own K-pop stars? Overall, I don\u2019t know how I would feel. Globally Asians are becoming more accepted, and I appreciate it, but I\u2019m not sure that including westerners is completely necessary (if that makes any sense). ",

            "answer_text": "Korea is a very homogenous country. You can be a K-pop star in Korea, but slim chances you are going to be famous. Koreans in general don\u2019t like non-asian looks because they\u2019re different. Korean entertainment industry has been trying to include girls and boys from non-asian race to be part of the group they\u2019re growing, but they disappeared faster than they appeared. That is as far as the news that I\u2019ve read, I might miss someone that is not. Being a K-pop star is a lot of work. I wouldn\u2019t do it if I were you. Easily summarized, you\u2019re going to have a hard time with their structural system in the community if you\u2019re from a country where it is a no big deal to call everyone \u2014 parents, boss, older people, the elderly \u2014 with \u2018you\u2019. In Korea, applying this method means suicide, it\u2019s a land where respect to the olders are in highest order. We all only see the sparkly life of an idol, how good it seems to be, how amazing it is to be surrounded by beautiful girls and handsome boys, but that\u2019s because we don\u2019t know really what they\u2019re going through. You have to be ready to lose everything at such a young age for a slim chance to debut. Not a bet I want to be in. And don\u2019t forget the fact that you might be sold to some higher ups for sex just for another chance to debut if you\u2019re from small entertainments. Famous entertainments have a slim chance at this, but are you ready to compete with hundreds, or even thousands, of other trainees for the same exact spot? Only hard work is not enough. You need hard work and a lot of luck. Korean entertainment world is darker than the deep web. What we see on TV and in the news is not even 1% of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically you can become. But here\u2019s bggest challenge buddy - You are 13 and European which means you are way to young to take an important decision just like that\u2026.while between age of 14\u201316 most korean kids are already scouted as trainees and signs a contract with some companies. Most importantly - Language, language, language!! As trainees ( and since idols will be trained in korea by korean companies) you need to be absolutely through with korean language. On top of that you will also be expected to learn Mandarin and Japanese since kpop is very prevalent in those markets first. English is literally like third or fourth in importance when comes to kpop language. Additionally, It is American music market that takes priority so your european accent is no advantage either. Trainees train in dance, music and singing for hours plus the food will be new for you as European. This is assuming that by some luck you get onboard with a company. There is no guarentee you will go through all this and still get a debut!! The level of professionalism and competition is kpop world is insane. They are also complete package - looks, voice, talent and overall appeal. Do you qualify? A short and more realistic answere for this my friend would be - You have a very very very slim chances of becoming part of Kpop scene! or Idol. The kpop world is very glamorous and attractive and looks all shimmer and shine - but the amount of work and social pressure that kpop idols have to manage is inhumanly high. I\u2019d suggest that you re-evaluate your reason to become kpop idol. Is it just that glamour and oppa craze and make up and looks that inspire you or you are genuinely in for music? If it\u2019s the first one and you are in it just for all the fun and cutesy stuff and fansigns - there is not even slim chance you will get somewhere. Every company knows how to seperate husk from grains !! you will be out before you know it. If you are in it for the genuine love of Music - there are many ways apart from kpop to explore that and build on it. You can start working on creating your own music and showcase your work on youtube and soundcloud. Build from there onwards. Honestly, I just feel that there are many people like you who don\u2019t do basic research into what are requirements for becoming an idol and just think they can get up an become idol - just because whatever xyz reason they think works in their favour. I wish you good luck for finding something inspiring ",

            "answer_text": "Yes actually a lot of non Asians have passed auditions the catch is of which companies? Most companies that have non Asians would be either type a) international entertainment companies : who hire models mostly Caucasian to be ever ready if they need them for modelling or being MCs . Type b) small companies who accept non Asians to have some kind of publicity while introducing an idol group. A lot of half Asians have gotten into the mainstream media but they are atleast half Korean, Chinese,Thai,Taiwanese (East Asian ethnicities in short). Now there is a rumour of an Indian boy being accepted by SM as a model for the first audition stage but he didn\u2019t go to Korea for the second stage . I know India is in Asia but Indian don\u2019t look like typical Asians and kpop has mostly East Asians. There is also a reality show somewhat like kpopstar which allows people of all nationalities and ethnicities to gain a platform to audition I don\u2019t recall it\u2019s name you could it for yourself . It is in South Korea though. There is also a all white group called \u2018EXP audition\u2019 in kpop that has about 50k subs on their YouTube channel . There is one half Japanese member I guess . There was also a trio called \u2018BuskerBusker\u2019 who broke into the mainstream kpop with the lead member being non asian they did put out quite some hits back then. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s happened before, EXP Edition (which is more of a spoof group and isn\u2019t to be taken seriously) aside: Alexandra Reid, who is of mixed African-American/Caucasian descent, was a member of the girl group Rania for a while. It didn\u2019t turn out well. It always felt like she was an add-on to the group; during their promotions she\u2019d just stroll on stage for her rap parts and leave afterwards to let the other members dance and sing. I was under the impression that this wasn\u2019t because she felt special and didn\u2019t have to do what the others did (I think there were one or two performances where she did perform with the group the whole time), but rather because the company didn\u2019t really know what to do with her. Eventually she and the group/company parted ways (and the group has disbanded since then, I think), but she still has a following and makes appearances at K-Pop events in the US, like KCON. So it\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s difficult. I figure some factors that would make it more possible is if you\u2019re completely fluent in Korean (which would certainly be a curiosity and novelty in the K-Pop world), and, of course, if you\u2019re good-looking and talented at singing and dancing. (P.S.: \u201cAmerican\u201d is not an ethnicity) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. There\u2019s definitely a chance, as long as you have some sort of artistic talent, such as singing or dancing. Also, knowing basic Korean is a very important of being an idol, since you\u2019ll be singing in Korean and have to reach out to a mostly Korean audience. I mean.. the chances of you becoming an idol are kinda small\u2026 but at least there\u2019s still a chance. Yes, Korean entertainment companies will most likely sign an Asian individual to work with them over someone of a different race, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from trying. Alexandra Reid is currently the the leader of the girl group RaNia. She is biracial (half-black and half-white) and is not of Asian descent! She\u2019s still a bit new to the group considering the fact that she joined RaNia in 2015 during their last comeback. The funny thing is, contrary to what I had mentioned earlier, she doesn\u2019t really know that much Korean.   Honestly, you may have a shot as long as you try your hardest. ",

I mean like, as long as they speak Korean decently, have talent, and can sing and dance, they are fine. In my opinion the \u201ck\u201d in kpop is is still there as long as you\u2019re keeping the culture, and of course the language. Take for example Oli London I don\u2019t think he should be considered a kpop idol, because of a few things. A) He\u2019s not singed to a Korean entertainment label B) He can\u2019t speak Korean fluently ( he\u2019s learning though so I\u2019ll give him that) C) He can\u2019t sing or dance The fact that he\u2019s still going is kinda amazing though, but his \u201cmusic\u201d is shameful, if he was part of Latino pop, and doing that, I would be ashamed. And for Kaachi I think they would have been better off as a normal pop group or should have been trainees longer, but if they had proper training and other things, they would have been fine, but to be considered kpop, they should have signed to a Korean label. But let\u2019s say they did, and they are trainees at the moment, they could be considered kpop at some point. A) I think with proper lessons, they could become fluent in Korean B) With good training, they have the ability to reach the expectations of kpop C) If they learn enough about the culture, they could finally be recognized as non-koreaboos I think as long as your respecting the culture, and don\u2019t just see it as a way of fame or popularity, you can be a kpop idol.

They add the non-korean members for \u201cmarket\u201d purpose, not just bringing foreign member in the group. For exemple EXO had chinese member for the chinese market. TWICE have japanese member for japanese market. Thailand is a rising countries (GDP) having a lot of fangirls/fanboy. So they add thai members (especially BIG3). So for the non-asian, he/she need to bring something useful to the group if he/she is a foreigner. ",

Most trainers won\u2019t even give you some slack even though it\u2019s obviously impossible to become fluent in any language in just a couple months or even years. Even if you are fluent in Korean, (it\u2019s the hard truth but) lots Koreans are racist af, even if they don\u2019t realize it. I\u2019ve heard stories of how Korean trainees give foreigners a hard time, which is awful obviously. (Also, obviously its not always like this.) And I\u2019m going to be completely honest here. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but this is just the reality: Most non-asian people who debut get lots of hate and get degraded all the time. But there are a couple non-asian idols out there who are pretty amazing! If you really think you can do it and have the talent, I believe in you. Hwaiting!

Well, K-pop is in the Korean language, targets the Korean audience, and is centered in Korea, which is in Asia. It\u2019s difficult to become famous as a non-Asian (as in European, African, Hispanic, etc. descent) in the Korean industry. However, there is definitely a future for non-Asians as they slowly but surely trickle into the industry. To help create a future for them, you could support people who are non-Asian or perhaps even mixed Asians and in the industry (EXP Edition, Somi, Vernon, Samuel [though they are Asian, they are helping create a more culturally inclusive kpop]).

I kinda hate how some companies treat foreign members differently than Korean ones, NCT for example, it\u2019s kinda old and idk if they still treat Renjun like that but I remember seeing stuff on Twitter about one of there managers telling him to shut up and when staff left Renjun alone in the rain. Kinda hate SM cuz of this, no wonder Lay is the only Chinese member of EXO now. So yeah, I'm ok with foreigners in the K-pop industry. I stan NCT and they have members from all over the world and I think that it\u2019s cool that there are many foreigner members in groups and you can tell that they worked hard to be where they are, they had to leave whatever country they are from, leaving behind there family and friends to go to South Korea, a place where they know no one and don\u2019t speak the same language and trained many hours a day to be where they are now. If I ever get the chance to become a K-pop idol, I would be too homesick and probably decide not to go to Korea because I don\u2019t want to be away from family and friends, I would get really anxious and wouldn\u2019t know what people are talking about for months since I don\u2019t speak Korean.

I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve seen EXP Edition but they are a kpop group that has no Korean members whatsoever and only one of them being asian\u2026  They have however encountered a lot of controversy. Some give them hate because they are not entirely fluent in Korean, they haven\u2019t trained as long as kpop idols usually do, and of course the fact that none of them are Korean. Another thing that I found odd about them is that they are older than when kpop idols usually debut. They debuted in 2017 when their oldest member was about 29 and their youngest at 24 which isn\u2019t that uncommon for an age to debut but is uncommon for the maknae. Well I went off topic but yes you can become a kpop star even if you aren\u2019t asian but you can certainly expect some controversy coming your way. ",

It\u2019s good that you have G.R.I.T and proper work ethic, but the K-pop industry backlashes at any Non-Korean in the industry. Some Idols are half Japanese and Korean, but still have Korean D.N.A in them and isn't really a big deal. A recent occurrence of this is Lana. Lana is Russian but managed to get her debut as a solo artist in the industry. Although Lana is Russian, she still looks the part:  Lana gets massive support for her home nation and from a few other, but she\u2019s also getting major backlash for not being Korean and having a Solo debut. Lana is just the rare occasion of success for foreigners. Lana trained for two years and some still consider her not ready for her debut. Foreigner in the Industry are frowned upon and your chances of success are close to none. Multiple foreigners have tired, few succeed, but end up crashing and burning. Please pick another career option. It really isn't worth the stress. -Jess the insomniac teen ",

At this point there are several successful Southeast Asian idols, with Thailand being the most common home country. There are also a few biracial idols that are successful or likely to be at least somewhat successful, such as Vernon in Seventeen and Somi and Lily M in JYP (no group debut yet.) Outside of that, the odds aren\u2019t great. There have been several groups from small agencies with non-Asian idols, but none have had much success. Perhaps this will change in a decade, but it\u2019s not likely to change in time for the question asker. As always, I encourage non-Asian fans that want to be in a k-pop group to consider starting their own group in their own country, and try to bring some of what they like about kpop to their culture.

As much as I hate to say it, but many people think you can become a Kpop idol if you\u2019re not Asian. That isn\u2019t exactly true. Being a Kpop idol means Asian singers really. As of now, there are no kpop idols who aren\u2019t asian or partially Asian. I don\u2019t really see that changing since the asian culture isn\u2019t as open as other countries. In order to even try out to be a Kpop idol, you probably have to be some sort of asian descent. For live, if you\u2019re not Asian, I highly doubt the company will take you. For online, it really depends. Although you many fit beauty standards, you\u2019re not Asian. And kpop is mainly about asian singers??? Not only that, the fans will probably ostracize you unless you can sing like Ailee? I\u2019m not sure, that\u2019s just my opinion, but don\u2019t let it stop you from trying! :) ",

Samuel is an american born Mexican and korean therefore half asian. There are global auditions from agencies. This should tell you about their openness already. Also Exp Edition is a kpop group with only one asian non Korean member. Did you check exp edition at award shows? The korean public and hosts were welcoming and happy. In short: YES ",

Some were white and some were black. It takes some time getting used to. Korea is a growing and developing country, but slowly they are becoming more accepting of non- asians in their industries. Having an open mindset is more visible here. Many people are now moving into the country which is a good start. As for the K-pop industry itself, I feel like for non-asians to make it they would have to practice incredibly hard for their audition. Prepping well and coming in with even the most basic knowledge of Korean will go a long way. The will and determination must show through to the judges which I think is how they choose. Hopefully in the near future, we will see some growth in the industry with new faces. Hope that helps! ",

This group is very much criticized by international k-pop fans. In Korea, I think that they\u2019re okay with it. EXP Edition was formed as an experiment (EXP - Experiment). They are a four-member boy group and is the first non-Korean k-pop group ever. Three of the members are non-Asian, while one of them is half-Japanese. Their company name is literally IMMABB (I\u2019m Making a Boy Band)\u2026  Personally, I would never have known about RaNia if not for Wikipedia\u2019s list of k-pop groups throughout the years. I only came across EXP Edition because of Super Junior. ",

And then there\u2019s EXP Edition which has no Korean members (only one guy is half-asian, rest are non-asian), but they are criticized a lot by kpop fans. Also none of the groups I have mentioned are popular and from the Big 3 companies. So, it is possible to become an idol if you\u2019re not Asian, but most likely, you\u2019re probably gonna start off at a small company, and be used as a \u201cprop\u201d to gain more attention for the group.

I think it is possible but for a larger company (Like SM or JYP) to recruit you, I think you may have to have some kind of BoA potential. All the people saying it's impossible obviously don't realise that anything you put your mind to is possible but with this situation in particular, it may take very VERY hard work. I say give it a go, and companies usually like determined people so if you don't pass the first time try and try again because honestly, not many people tend to get through their first audition anyway.

However they are not so popular, not necessarily because koreans do not like them, but because international fans have hated them and rejected them. Because K-pop is Korean Pop, the idols are asian to appeal to the mostly asian crowd that listens and watches them. Just like western pop artists aren\u2019t asian and whenever an asian artist releases music they receive backlash from fans of other artists. It\u2019s not that a non asian person cannot become a kpop idol, because it has been done before, but they will be rejected by society. Also because there are some very strict specific beauty requirements in korea (well not just korea but asia and the rest of the world as well), foreigners have a hard time fulfilling these requirements.

I do see Westerners call BTS and other kpop groups racist slurs sometimes, which is sickening. The point is, kpop is for ASIANS to shine, to give them some spotlight. In a typical Western movie, you barely see an Asian character, maybe a side character now and then.. how many Asian-American singers that many people actually know can you name? White people who want to become kpop idols should just, imo, stick to their own or similar countries when joining the music industry. Please let Asians have something for once, this goes for every race reading this. Not saying you can\u2019t be an idol, just saying it HAS helped empower Asian people, with some groups gaining global recognition. Hope this made sense, enjoy. ",

Their ability to speak KoreanAre they any percent Asian or 0%?Their talents and sometimes looksHow well they can danceAre they somewhat light skinned?These are just a few factors that can come into play when agencies are looking for foreigners to train to be a part of a group.

The only reasons why Entertainments would rarely take non Asians is for easy promotions, not because they certainly like you. I\u2019m sorry to break it to anyone who wants to be in kpop when they\u2019re not asian, but America and other countries have their own type of music and you can be an artist in your own country, you don\u2019t need to go to Korea and do 10x the work, learn the language, Learn the culture, take years of singing, dancing, and rapping, while waiting for your debut. You can sing, dance do whatever in your own country without much work. All you really need is the talent. Korea and Asia in general is just way more difficult. I know some people would want a challenge but like I said it would be weird for a non asian to represent an asian country and music style when they\u2019re not of that certain race. ",

So if you want to have a chance at full stardom if you have no Asian decent at all maybe try America, the western music industry is pretty good it has quiet a bit of opportunity. If not maybe try a good musically successful European country like let\u2019s say Great Britain. I hope this helped.\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc9c ",

It will be very hard though because Korea does have High standards and isn\u2019t very welcoming. There is this one K-pop idol Named Lana. She is a Russian singer-songwriter under HiCC. Based in South Korea, she debuted as the first solo Russian idol on June 27, 2019 with the single \"Take The Wheel\". She trained for over 2 years and can speak Korean well enough, i hope that inspires you.  ",

The K pop industry is kind of an entity of its own so unless you were born in Asia, there isnt much hope for Kpop. But like I said you can always apply at a company and see if they maybe have a department you\u2019d fit into or if you are good enough they will hire you on and mold something to your style. Dont give up on your dream and best of luck <3 ",

Nothing really. So I would say go for it even if there is a small chance, it is still worth a shot! ",

This is primarily the reason why mixed race celebrities are popular in Asia : They want celebrities who carry European features, but still look like Asian. Unfortunately, for the darked skin Africans, their skin complexion won\u2019t meet the beauty standards of most Asian countries. ",
