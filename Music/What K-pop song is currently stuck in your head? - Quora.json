            "answer_text": "I\u2019m one of those people who you\u2019ll find humming random songs 24/7, so, uh, here goes nothing\u2026 Also, this list isn\u2019t by any specific order, I just put down the songs in a random order. 1- Through The Night (IU) One of the songs I hum everyday. Why does this song have to be so beautiful- 2- N/S (Stray Kids) RED LIGHT GREEN LIGHT SWAG- 3- Cloud (Rothy) My favorite OST of all time. Ever since I watched The Beauty Inside, there literally hasn\u2019t been one day when I did not hum this song. 4- I Will Go To You Like The First Snow (Ailee) I love this OST as well. Ailee\u2019s vocals are out of this world! 5- Hands Up (2PM) I get hyped within the first few seconds of this song. I miss 2PM. 6- Mixtape: On Track (Stray Kids) The song has really meaningful lyrics and the tune is just a bop. 7- Hush (EVERGLOW) I\u2019m not a huge fan of this song, but it just randomly started playing in my head. 8- Blueming (IU) This, along with TTN (listed as #1), are my favorite IU songs. I hum this song every day (if not, every second). Her voice is so soothing! 9- LALALAY (Sunmi) My all-time favorite K-pop song. 10- Anpanman (BTS) I recently haven\u2019t been as into BTS as before, but this song is so catchy and it rings in my head all the time. 11- eight (IU & Suga) THIS IS AN AMAZING SONG! PERIOD. 12- Fiesta (IZ*ONE) The tune is super catchy. 13- Paradise (Siyeon-DREAMCATCHER) Beautiful tune, beautiful lyrics. 14- FANCY (TWICE) This song has appeared on a lot of other people\u2019s lists as well, and that\u2019s not surprising. 15- JELLY (Soyeon-(G)I-DLE) Sorry if I didn\u2019t spell (G)I-DLE correctly\u2026 anyway, I find Soyeon\u2019s voice really attractive, no matter if she\u2019s rapping or singing. The song is catchy. 16- Outro: Tear (BTS) You\u2019re my tear, You\u2019re my, you\u2019re my tear\u2026 Okay, and that concludes my list! Obviously it\u2019s always changing, but that\u2019s all that I can think of for now. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I would like to continue vibing to my infinite K-pop playlist. ",

Now, with that out of the way, here is my list. \uadf8\ub300\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uae30\ubd84\uc774\uc2e0\uac00\uc694 - VINXEN Feat. Woo Won JaeI have no idea how I'm supposed to translate the title into English, since the video with ENG subs has been blocked for 19+ content. I've read the lyrics, though, and I believe they blocked the video because it mentions self-harm.The Little Prince - HAON & PULLIKAnd there are more\u2026 Hayne Kang's answer to I want more K-Rap songs added to my playlist! What are some that I can add, recommendations \u2764\ufe0f? Actually, before I made that answer I had been staying away from K-rap for a while, but as I searched up those songs I fell in love with them once again. I know I put K-rap in a different category from K-pop in my other answer Hayne Kang's answer to Do other genres of music exist in Korea? But it's just that those are the ones I've been listening to a lot for the past few days. Spending time at home made me wander a lot\u2026 I explored J-pop, English pop, K-pop rookies, Disney OSTs and now, K-rap. I think I might repeat the cycle sometime soon. Anyway, thanks for reading and stay safe :) ",
