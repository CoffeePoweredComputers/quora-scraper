            "answer_text": "Eiichiro oda, the author of one piece, says that the manga so far is 80% finished. It is very long because of all the adventures luffy is having and of all the popularity it is recieving in japan and all over the world. So far, the story is a long ride if emotions and amazing adventures that the viewers enjoy and appreciate. Eiichiro oda has made one of the best stories in the world and the best selling manga of all time. And i say im glad one piece is as long as it is now. If it ended with luffy obtaining the one piece earlier on, i would be disappointed in oda and how he finished the story quicker than the potiential it has. One piece is, hands down, the best manga/anime i have ever seen so far. ",

            "answer_text": "Due to how complex of a world and a narrative Oda has planned, the world is vast and the number of important characters that need to finish their stories is crazy. It is going to take time for Oda to scribe it all out and make it as satisfying as he wants it to be. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something to worry about, with most long manga I am seriously questioning whether or not it is necessary or if it\u2019s just time wasting but that is not the case at all with One Piece, the more One Piece the better.
