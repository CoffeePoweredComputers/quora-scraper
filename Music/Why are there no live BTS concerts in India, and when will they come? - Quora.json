            "answer_text": "Holding a concert in a place depends on various factors such as the success of the albums that were released earlier as in physical sales, streams, itunes charting etc. Though india has always been charting BTS\u2019s song to No 1 in itunes. We somehere lack in physical sales and all. And when it comes to youtube streaming, As an ARMY, it breaks my heart while writing this thing but no video of BTS ever trended in india except the jimmy fallon\u2019s fortnite challenge one :) Though we have dedicated indian fanbases and so many twitter accounts trying to make Bighit notice Indian ARMYs but at the end of the day it all comes down to one point i.e their profit. But hey ! There is a super good news for Indian Armys as BTS\u2019s first movie \u2018Burn the stage : the movie\u2019 will be screened in many parts of India. Yayayyayayayayy it\u2019s a huge success and concludes that they are aware of fanbase here :) I am so happy ! As of coming to India i guess this year\u2019s LY World Tour has realeased all asian dates and India is nowhere :\u2019) so some ARMYs will fly to hongkong or bangkok to watch the concerts. But it\u2019s mentioned that more dates will be released so hoping for the best ddaeng  ",

            "answer_text": "I think India is one of the countries which contain maximum ARMY but still Big Hit doesn't seem to have any plan to send bts to India. There may be many reasons but probably one must be that Indians are basically discriminated in Korea(MY ASSUMPTION MAY BE WRONG BUT I HAVE SEEN THIS IN MANY VIDEOS) OR MAYBE big Hit is planning to include India in next World Tour? Or maybe next to that? BUT TIRED OF THIS ,ME AND MY FRIEND ARE PLANNING TO GO TO S.KOREA FOR UPCOMING CONCERTS(this was our last choice but still we love traveling as well as music and bts ofc.) LOVE, ARMY ",
