            "answer_text": "You need to be a tad more specific, as there are multiple different songs with the same or similar titles. The three best known are probably the following: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) - Eurthymics, from the album of the same name released in 1983. Annie Lennox is the lead vocalist on the track, which reached number 2 on the UK charts and topped the US Billboard 100 later that year.Sweet Dreams (of You) - a ballad by country singer Don Gibson first released in 1955. Several other versions of the song enjoyed commercial success in the years that followed - these were recorded by Faron Young (1956), Patsy Cline (1963, shortly before her untimely death), Tommy McLain (1966), Tammy Wynette (1975), Reba McEntyre (1991) and Chet Atkins & Mark Knopfler (instrumental version - 1990).Sweet Dreams - Beyonce, from her 2008 album \u201cI am Sacha Fierce\u201d. It was released as a single the following year (the sixth from said album) and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard chart in November that year. It also made the top 3 in the UK and number 2 in Australia.",
