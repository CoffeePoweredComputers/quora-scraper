            "answer_text": "It\u2019s funny trying to answer this good question. Mozart was so superfast facile; so immersed in music at home, due to his dad Leopold\u2019s long-established profession; and so apt to compose as soon as he learned something new, that our concept of \u201cpractice\u201d hardly applies to him. For Mozart, it was \u201cplay.\u201d But we know a little bit. Mozart learned pieces composed by his father. And he learned music by other composers, compiled by his father into albums for both little Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl. An album of pieces by Leopold and others was compiled for Nannerl in 1759, when Mozart was 3. (The \u2018others\u2019 were names barely familiar to us today, like Agrell, Tischer, Wagenseil.) Mozart had learned some of Nannerl\u2019s album music before he was 5.In 1762, when Mozart was 6, his father gave him an album of pieces arranged into Suites of various lengths. One of them contained only an Aria & Musette. Another was fully furnished with Aria-March-Menuet-Gigue-& Polonaise. These were all of North German character. Composers included were Telemann, Philipp Emanuel Bach, Hasse, & Kirckhoff.And in 1764 Paris, when Mozart was 8, the composers Schobert, Eckardt, Le Grande, & Hochbrucker all presented young Mozart and his sister with copies of their sonatas. He would have learned these, and then emulated them (especially Schobert) with compositions of his own.But Mozart\u2019s greatest love was reserved for Johann Christian Bach, whose music was likewise influenced by lyrical Italian opera. Whatever music Mozart \u201cpracticed\u201d to learn also became a basis for his impulse to compose and create. For Mozart, it was all one. ",
