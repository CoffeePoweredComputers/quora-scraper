            "answer_text": "Mixing and mastering is not my expertise but I know a thing or two about what comes before it. I would start with getting your arrangement right and sorted. Know why something is there. Classify your stuff. FL Studio has a great grouping mechanism in the channel rack. Check it out.  Less is more. Remove stuff you don't need. Two same sounding instruments can be layered. You don't need two separate channels for each. Try to keep your drums in one place. I hope to learn a drum machine like the one native knstiments has (forgot the name). Put all your hi hats, snares, open hats in one place. If possible do it in one channel or else do it in one pattern. Finally, DON'T MIX WHILE ARRANGING. It made many of my projects hopeless. Just try to make it sound interesting. If you have a piano, arrange your notes and play it and modify everything on the piano. Then lay it out in FL. A few tips about mixing: Experiment with what works. Remember that now you're no longer trying to make the tune interesting. You want the listener not to be ear fatigued. Pan some sounds to make the output stereo. AUTOMATION. I can't stress this enough. Although it crosses over to arrangement, it can be seen in the mixing sense too as it can mess the balance of your mix. Nevertheless, automate. As much as. You. Can. Songs can come out perfect without automation too. I'm not stomping on your creativity. Just putting it out there. It helps to easily shift your listener to the next part of the song. Or through different parts of the song. Without losing the suspense. For example if you're shifting scales (Major to minor, minor to pentatonic, etc.), you can guarantee that it fits with the song by gently filtering it in. Or have it reverb at certain points. The choices are endless. Again, less is more. Don't try to increase the volume of a certain track because it's too quiet. Instead try to lower the volumes of the rest of the tracks first, to see if there is any difference. Your mix is always going to sound quiet in the end so don't worry about that. That's what mastering is for. Be careful of the bass. It's one of the things that I never got right. Sometimes it's way overpowering and it's all you hear. Sometimes it's way soft and can be squashed by the simplest pluck instrument. What I would do in this case is EQ and remove all the bass from the rest of the instruments. And then remove everything but the low end on the bass. It will sound muffled. But you don't address this in the mix. You master it with compression and limiters and what not. Get good gear. A neutral headphone and speakers placed equally apart from you and faced towards you at the same time. Treat your room with acoustics if you are mixing with the speakers. I have an Audio Technica ATH-M50x. It got the job done but the mids got ruined (by accident) so a casual headphone but a great mixing tool.  Finally, know when to quit. Ear fatigue happens to the best of us. Your arrangements are not bad. Your mixes might need some work but not bad. But if you spend 3 hours or more on that one project, you will hate it. So, stop after some time. Get away from the studio (or your DAW if you are only using PC). Take a walk, watch a movie, etc. Then when you can come back you'll have tons of ideas that will make you go: Wow I have a killer song! Anyways these are my tips. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t use FL Studio, but I\u2019m all too familiar with muddy mixes. The first thing you need is a proper pair of Active Nearfield Sudio Monitors. Those are special speaker which don\u2019t add or remove anything from the audio you are working with, that is to say they give you a \u201ctruer\u201d picture of your mix. Truth is, all monitors have their own characteristics, but I personally use the ADAM Audio - A7X Active Studio Monitor (Nearfield) which seem to give me an untainted audio image. Secondly, learn to love the EQ. Every track will need an EQ, and you will need to be very aggressive, only keep the frequencies you actually need to hear in the mix. This may make some tracks sound thin and unpleasant when solo, but should sit happily in the mix. ",
