            "answer_text": "I recommend a Chinese song \"d\u012b d\u0101\" by Kan Kan.  If you've ever been to the Old Town in Lijiang (it's almost a requirement for China tourism), you'll remember its little winding streets. Part of that for many people is the song d\u012b d\u0101 by the singer KanKan. It's a simple song, with just guitar, vocals and violins, but it's very pleasant to listen to. You'll know it if you've heard it - it has a distinctive onomatopoeia line that repeats throughout the song. As far as I know, Di Da has become a bit of a cliche. You go to Lijiang on a romantic holiday with your partner, hear Di Da everywhere (every shop plays it on repeat), and after that Di Da becomes your nostalgic song for that holiday. Seriously, it seems like vast numbers of people have had the same experience with this song. It's also worth remembering that whilst Lijiang is very nice, it's also maximised its tourism about as far as you can go. It's a bit like Venice. It is genuinely a nice place but you can't get away from the fact that it's making a lot of money, and everyone there knows it. Anyway, on with the song! d\u012b d\u0101 lyrics translation D\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 Sh\u00edzh\u0113n t\u0101 b\u00f9 t\u00edng z\u00e0i zhu\u01cend\u00f2ng  The hour hand, it never stops turning D\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 Xi\u01ceoy\u01d4 t\u0101 p\u0101id\u01cezhe shu\u01d0hu\u0101  Light rain, she patters and splashes D\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 d\u00edd\u0101 Sh\u00ec b\u00f9sh\u00ec h\u00e1i hu\u00ec qi\u0101ngu\u00e0 t\u0101  Will I still worry about him?

            "answer_text": "My favorite Chinese songs are probably complete opposites, and TBH, very biased. I\u2019ve heard a total of 6 Chinese songs- 4 by Z.Tao and 2 by Kris Wu. I know, right? Ex-EXO members. Pretty biased. Anyway, songs 1 & 2 are the slower and sweeter (song 1) Time Boils The Rain and (song 2) There is a Place (\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9) by Kris Wu. Time Boils The Rain  Favorite line: w\u01d2men sh\u01d2u l\u0101sh\u01d2u y\u011b ch\u00e9ng zh\u014du / hu\u00e0gu\u00f2 b\u0113ish\u0101ng h\u00e9li\u00fa - hand in hand we may form a boat / carrying us across the river of sadness[1] There is a Place (\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9)  Favorite line: w\u01d2 xi\u01cengq\u01d0 zu\u00ecch\u016b n\u01d0 m\u00fay\u00e0ng xi\u01cengq\u01d0 b\u0101nb\u00f3 de sh\u00edgu\u0101ng - I think back to my first sight of you, think back to those mottled times[2] Song 3 is the faster, more upbeat, polar opposite of songs 1 & 2, Black White (AB) by ZTAO. Black White (AB)  Favorite line: y\u01d0w\u00e9i w\u00e1nm\u011bi de ji\u00e9j\u00fa y\u01cenbi\u00e0n ch\u00e9ngle \u00e8m\u00e8ng - the perfect ending turned into a nightmare[3] Anyway, as I am foreign, and these are my favorite, while very biased, Chinese songs, I believe I\u2019ve answered your question!
