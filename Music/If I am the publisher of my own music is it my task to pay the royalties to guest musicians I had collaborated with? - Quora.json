            "answer_text": "NO. I own a music publishing company (small one, but since \u201893), as well as a label. It is NOT your task to pay the royalties to guest musicians, it is up to you to pay them an upfront session fee, as well as include their percentages in the ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers) (or other money collecting company) sheets you sent in. It is THEIR responsibility to sign up with ASCAP or BMI (Harry fox as well), and it is these companies that take responsibility for putting the correct amounts of royalty income into the correct account. If I had to INDIVIDUALLY pay every musician a check EVERY quarter for domestic and foreign sales, downloads, tv and movie plays, I would lose my freakin mind. No way. Every musician I deal with I tell them straight up, it is YOUR responsibility to sign up to collect your royalties, it is MY responsibility AS PUBLISHER/ OWNER of music, to make sure that the proper percentages are on the submission sheet for every song, and that is ALL you should be responsible for. Otherwise, your phone would ring non stop for people wanting to go over the books, people arguing about how much they got, people wanting you to advance them money on the next distribution, it would never work. You\u2019d go crazy. ",

            "answer_text": "If your collaborator is listed as a co-author, then they are entitled to royalties. If your collaborator was only a performer, then probably they were paid in full when they did the work, with no further responsibility from you. If they had made some kind of deal with you to get a percentage of royalties even though they were only a performer, then yes, you have to live up to the deal you made. ",
