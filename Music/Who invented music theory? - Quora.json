            "answer_text": "There is no single \u201cmusic theory\u201d. Music theory is simply a description of the elements that are used in a particular type of music as well as an explanation of the different ways that they are put together in that sort of music. What we tend to think of as music theory; harmony, counterpoint, major and minor scales, chords, The circle of fourths, and such nonsense, are really just the elements used in European compose music from the 16th or 17th to the 19th centuries and what we sometimes call \u201cthe age of common practice\u201d. It' s really important to understand that this theory was written after-the-fact, to describe what composers had been doing. Also very important to understand that each composer stretched and expanded \u201cThe rules\u201d to suit their own personal needs, to the delight of their audiences, and to the annoyance of the people who were tied down to what had gone before. By the beginning of the 20th century, a lot of composers had brought a lot of stuff from outside of the classical music toolbox into their work, and there were some who threw it out completely. The popular music that we listen to and play today uses elements from classical music theory as a basis, but uses a lot of elements and structures that are not from that tradition. .The composed music of today often uses none of the elements of classical music; not the structures, not the harmonies,not the scales, not the pitches, not even the instruments though oddly enough, most of the modern day composers have studied classical music theory pretty carefully. Go figure. A couple of the important writers about music theory included Jean-Phillippe Rameau, whose explanation of how harmonies worked was essential to 18th and 19th century composers,is almost incomprehensible to contemporary Readers. Zarlino laid down the rules for counterpoint and is a lot easier to understand, but he describes 16th and 17th century music. Hindemith wrote in the 20th century, and he explains everything, from constructing chromatic scales based on the harmonic overtone series on up, but he\u2019s pretty heavy going- however when we get to music like free jazz and funk, nobody's really explained the theory yet.

            "answer_text": "Pythagoras gave it a good start by identifying the octave -- his followers built on that:  Though ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,[4] the Pythagoreans (in particular Philolaus and Archytas[5]) of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of musical scales in terms of numerical ratios,[6] particularly the ratios of small integers. Their central doctrine was that \"all nature consists of harmony arising out of numbers\".[7] -- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_mathematics  Early Greek treatises on music do not use the term \"mode\" (which comes from Latin), but do describe three interrelated concepts that are related to the later, medieval idea of \"mode\": (1) scales (or \"systems\"), (2) tonos\u2014pl. tonoi\u2014(the more usual term used in medieval theory for what later came to be called \"mode\"), and (3) harmonia (harmony)\u2014pl. harmoniai\u2014this third term subsuming the corresponding tonoi but not necessarily the converse (Mathiesen 2001a, 6(iii)(e)). -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_%28music%29 ",
