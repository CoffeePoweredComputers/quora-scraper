            "answer_text": "BASIC ARTICULATION: connected, separated. Add dynamics and all else are variants. On a wind instrument you maintain the airstream and change the note, sometimes as with the trombone you use a soft articulation such as \u2018doo\u2019 to assist the slurring to avoid glissando. On piano we use contiguous finger patterns and when one finger is coming up the other goes down. This way the sound remains connected from note to note. Otherwise, there is a natural space between notes accomplished by lifting fingers and depressing keys so as to achieve that spacing. ",

            "answer_text": "To make slurs easier, I usually think about legato and always connecting the keys so that it doesn\u2019t sound chopped up. You should never pick up your last finger until you have played the next note, which makes it easier to do as well. ",
