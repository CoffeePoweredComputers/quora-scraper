            "answer_text": "Can\u2019t imagine why anyone should care about this kind of thing! It is not like how ever much they make would make a difference in your life. However, if you would like to know such info because you would like to join Kpop industry, let me disabuse you (or anyone for that matter) of such silly notion! I guess either you must be a young or a new Kpop fan who just joined the bus. Unlike what many may have imagined, a Kpop star doesn\u2019t earn much. In fact, they earned peanuts! For comparison, Big Bang (legendary Kpop boy band) is the most successful boy band in South Korea and has been successful for a decade straight. Their collective net worth would most likely be around 50 million USD. The vast bulk of it is due to G-Dragon (around 20-ish millions according to most reputable sources). G-Dragon has many songs written under his name that Suga cannot compare to him yet. Big Bang is also the face of the biggest name brand in South Korea for many years running and still running. For all that success, their entire net worth is most likely not as impressive as you would think. You might not know who they are, but just know they are big and successful and have been so for 10 years. Other Quorans who have been Kpop watchers for a while can assure you of their successes. With that in mind as a goal post, let us think about BTS. In Kpop industry, there is something called Trainee debt. When a band is debuted, they will not be paid much, if at all, until they paid off that debt. 3 years seems to be an accepted number for a moderately successful band and many people will consider that to be a rather fast one too. I strongly believe that BTS only paid off their debt around late 2016 to early 2017. I do not have proof and no one but BTS and BigHit would have such proof. However, if you have watched many of their Run episode, you would notice that Taehyung wore a fake Gucci in one of the run episode in 2016. This, in many ways, is surprising because I would have imagined that back in 2016 he should have been the most well-paid of the bunch as he was casted in a drama (more lucrative). I have proof of that if you are interested. They only moved out of their old dorm around 2016 also, if I remember correctly. Furthermore, the balance of power in Kpop sucks and it favours the management company massively. A slave contract is not unheard of and used to be very common practice. Personally, I think BTS would be in a less horrible contract with BigHit but the profit sharing would still be very terrible. Despite what many people thinks about BTS and BigHit, their relationship is a business transaction. To be very cold hearted, you can say BTS, itself, is a legally incorporated person for tax purpose. It is often said that in the big3, the profit sharing is 20% to the band. And in lesser companies (BTS included at the time of BTS debut), the sharing is 10% to 15%. This is what many \u201cKpop insiders\u201d (those trainee or idols who failed to make it) claim to be the norm of the industry. You may say that BTS has many concerts and those concerts bring in big donuts. You are correct but, again, who will get the biggest share? I bet you, it will be BigHit. As well, to put in perspective again, BigBang has many more concerts in US and the world than BTS has right now. Their collective net worth is not that great in comparison to their successes! So, for BTS whose breakout success is last year, I would not be surprise that they are not making all that much yet. As well, you might not know about it, but BTS presence is not strong in Korea. It is growing right now but it is not the greatest. Kpop idols often earn more money from appearances on variety shows, commercial and drama appearances. Right now, these three things are under lock and key by Big Bang, Exo and Wanna One. As a matter of fact, Kang Daniel of Wanna One is considered to have the reputation index in South Korea right now. So, a couple big sources of revenue are out of BTS\u2019 hand right now. If I was pressed to say, how much they are worth right now. I would say they are worth in the mid of 600k and possibly a shy of 700k for Namjoon or Suga. (Edit: Made mistakes the last time as 6k when I meant to say 600k!) It is unfortunate really for they are really successful right now. I hope BigHit will manage them better in the near future to allow them to make as much money as possible while they can when the lime light is on. ",
