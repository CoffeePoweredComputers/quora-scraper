            "answer_text": "Teach them to be grateful for what they have and who they are. Teach them life skills. How to clean, cook, garden, sew, manage a household. Teach them to think for themselves. Give them easy choices right from the beginning. I take care of infants and dialog all day to them what we\u2019re about to do and how we can appreciate and get ready for it. Validate their choices even if you don\u2019t agree with them. Teach them money skills with an allowance for chores easily completed. Allow children to choose their interests rather than managing them. Many people spend time in therapy because they were taught to please others (parents) rather than serve themselves or others. Huge difference! Do not give them everything they want every minute to stop their nagging for things. Giving them everything they want when they want it amplifies greed. Allow them to fail. Failure just means you are exploring new things or aren\u2019t up to speed in some area. That doesn\u2019t mean not to pursue it, learn more, draw more, dance more\u2026whatever it is. I took my first dance class at 30 years. Starting belly dancing at 40 years and I\u2019m still performing today at 60 years for some seniors. Teach them respect for all people from all walks of life. Teach them that people every where want the same thing\u2026to be loved, to belong and have meaningful activities\u2026..especially people who are angry, sad, homeless or down trodden. In this you can teach boundaries that people need to have with others who might mistreat them for the rest of their natural life. Model for children authenticity, adaptability and let them in on your life skills. Some kind of spiritual foundation helps with this tall order. We\u2019re never done but we\u2019re here to try to make it right. ",

Because if you want them to be rich with money then the only thing u can do is get I really good job But if your not a stuck up snob and you want your kids to be rich in values then listen to them be patient and teach them about life and the most important this is to be there for your kids Make them value family more than money and stuff ",
