Then you suddenly realized that making money from Youtube is completely real. Suddenly you ask yourself the question: \" How much money do people make from Youtube videos with 1 million views ?\u201d After a while wandering the internet searching for information and now you're reading my post. I have a good news and a bad news for you. Which news do you want to hear first? Of course it's fun! That is what you found the right article to read. The bad news is that I don't have the right answer for you. When I first joined YouTube to make money online, most of us have a big question: \"Will YouTube pay for each view?\". How much is that number actually? Finally after a little investigation I got the answer, it really depends on who you ask. Most people think that it is $ 1 for every 1000 views, others answer that number must be $ 3. Indeed, I was surprised when there were people who gave the figure a startling $ 10. At this point, we all know we're asking the wrong questions. We should do it to be asked by others. Before learning about the money, it is important to understand the basics of how Youtube pays. Firstly, YouTube pays when an Ad is displayed on your video. All you need to do is link your channel with Google AdSense (monetization) and rest is handled by Google. The Google AdSense is worlds most popular Advertising network used by publishers offering high fill rate. Google makes use of user cookies and searches history behavior to display interest-based contextual ads thus giving high earnings. The YouTubers are only paid if the viewers do some sort of action with Ads which we will learn in detail below. The Ad types for mobile App or website and desktop version are different. For mobile devices, Google displays Video Ads (Skippable & Non-Skippable) and Sponsored Cards below the Video.For Desktop versions, Google displays video Ads, Sponsored cards, overlay Ads, banner ads and teaser ads in various combination. Normally, videos on Youtube that achieve a view amount of 1,000,000 is not much, so I will mention that the whole channel reaches 1 million views in a certain time period. It depends on where your country you live and the orientation of the audiences, they are living in undeveloped, developed or developing country. Because, the profits you earn more from large market than small market.  In 2018 this YouTube has a lot of changes, since the scandal about advertising is allowed to show on content that is not suitable for advertisers. Since then, Youtube has changed many times to make it more suitable for brands and brands to revive their beliefs. The main revenue contributors for Youtube. ",

            "answer_text": "I happen to have 2 semi-successful youtube channels. Gamers Den and America 2.0. And yes I am from the United States of America currently broadcasting at 8/4/15. There seems to be two varying degrees of CPM, One is playback Based, the other is Impression Based. One is I think the ideal. The other I believe is the average expected. You will see which is which when I put the numbers down. GD = Pb-CPM = $9.45 USD, Ib-CPM = $6.78 USD AM 2.0 =  Pb-CPM = $7.86, Ib-CPM = $5.00 USD Two things to remember. 1) Not all industries of video types are created equal on Youtube. Videos on gaming, movies make a LOT MORE. Then News/Politics. Gamers Den is a Gaming/Movies Review page. America 2.0 is a current events/news page. However. With that said. My America 2.0 is almost at 1.8 Million views  = this is where Youtube pays you. I am still wondering which it will be based on but if I do everything right and ride everything out to the ending of the month I should get (1.8)(7.86)(1,000 views) = $14,148 USD this month. However I think it will be Ib-CPM or = $9,000 USD.  Knowing holey well I have never done much to earn this kind of cash in the real world - In my life. I almost bet beyond any reasonable doubt there is a reason it will only be a half or a quarter of these numbers that I end up seeing. I've run America 2.0 for about 8 months. I have bought subs. I have uploaded 3-5 videos a day 4 days in a row, with 1 day rest.  Gamer's Den is still new. I won't make any major money for the next 3-4 months. When I do it will be huge numbers. We will use the same 1.8M view principal. And just do the math like we did the first 2 times with America 2.o. These figures are  Pb-CPM = $17,010 and Ib-CPM = $12,204 So if your thinking of Youtube. Do it. Invest in it. Make it happen. I got 3 people into right now. They are making pennies on the dollar a month. But by this time next year they will probably be buying a second home or something similar with the money they are making. ",
