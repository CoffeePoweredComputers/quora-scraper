It opened January 26, 1988, so it\u2019s been running continuously for over 30 years, and is listed at the Internet Broadway Database at 13,318 performances. That makes it the longest running Broadway show of all time. Second place goes to \u201cChicago,\u201d the revival that opened November 14, 1996; and third place is held by \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d which opened November 13, 1997. Note that the longest running off-Broadway show, \u201cThe Fantasticks,\u201d ran for 42 years, so \u201cPhantom\u201d still has some work to do. ",
