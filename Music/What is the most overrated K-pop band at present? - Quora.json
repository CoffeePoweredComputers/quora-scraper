            "answer_text": "It's been a while, but\u2026 BTS Okay. I'll try not to be one of those people who shit on a band because they got popular (though the fans need to chill a lot). BTS is in the list because they don't live up to their potential. It's there, but they don't quite reach it yet, even though their fans act like they already did and have surpassed the expectations. Frankly speaking, they need to sit down and hire a good vocal teacher, preferably one that can teach them classically. Better their vocal control and techniques so they don't mess up their vocal chords in the next three years. Rest those throats for a bit. BTS vocalists have variety in their vocal colors, but not as much as people like to think. You can still say \u201cah, yes. A kpop group.\u201d And they're not that strong vocally compared to a lot of other male groups. That needs to change. And frankly, their live-singing lately had been terrible. Which ruins their image and strengthen public opinion that BTS is overhyped and overrated. Maybe ease their coreography. I can't say anything about the rap parts because I have no interest nor knowledge in it. This one is subjective, but I've been disappointed in their comebacks. They seem to lose their previous\u2026 I don't know. 'Soul' in their music, perhaps. Their new songs are just too market-pandering. Good lyrics, but market-pandering nonetheless. So emo. Like tumblr. And the melody isn't as great as before, imo. Eh People change. Bands evolve. Not my cup of tea anymore, though Oh, and a lot of armys are going to get my throat for this but oh well: you guys don't actually think the boys composed their songs 100% by themselves, do you? Cause it's not as simple as thinking of a melody, write it down on paper, sing it at the studio and voila! There's a lot of aspects to consider which needs actual professionals. Red Velvet Ugh. I hated this group before. Their songs grates my ears! I had no idea why in Jesus' delicious wine they're popular aside from the fact that they're from SM! But the thing is, I think RV is both overrated and underrated at the same time. I want to say overhyped\u2026 but they're not hyped? RV is a weird situation and I'm not sure how to go around describing it. The girls are mostly talented, sure. Their vocals are actually great and they harmonize so well! I would LOVE to listen to them all the time! Except for those red songs. WHY must they exist??? Sure, those songs are catchy and energetic but they take away the beauty their voices could be! I never thought I'd like a RV song until I learned of some of the velvet ones. And the duet with John Legend, that was gold. RV has a lot of talent and potential. That talent and potential are hyped up like whoa by their catchy and hard to sing-along-properly songs. But damn, those songs undermined their talent at the same time. And I need stronger dance and better choreo. Come on SM! This is supposed to bw 4th gen's SNSD! What are you doing?????? Sistar Don't get me wrong. I love their songs and mvs. They're just SO GREAT. But as a group, Sistar is underwhelming in a lot of ways. First of all, it's Hyorin ft her backup singers/dancers. We get a little bit of Soyu here and there, but the ratio is just ridiculous. This is Kpop. Not Destiny's Child! Second, what's the point of a sub unit if it, too, is Hyorin ft Bora the backup dancer? Third, I actually don't think Sistar's vocal line is strong compared to the other 2nd/3rd gen (omg just how many generations there are I'm an old fan I'm so confused) girl groups except for Hyorin, which might be the reason why she's so dominating (but still, some of her parts could be sung by the other members too!). Their songs are just catchy, but they don't emphasize the members' vocals. Except for one. This is becoming Hyorin bashing. I'm so sorry to Hyorin and her fans. It's not my intention, but it vexes me that the company focuses on mostly one member. If a group is a machine, then all the parts that made it must all fit and work together in making the machine work. If not\u2026 then why the hell build that machine? Why not just that part alone then? And I actually like Hyorin's voice. ",

            "answer_text": "In my mind there are only 2 kpop groups are overrated. The first group is BTS for sure. I was quiet like them, and my favorite BTS album is there very first album. In their first album, the quality of songs were good and I could found their passion through their eyes. However, thing started change since then. BTS company and whole fandom made people think they wrote and composed their songs by themselves. In fact, they indeed somehow involved into the process, but they work along with 4 or 5 or even more professional producer. BTS fandom also really proud of their stage performance. If you are new into KPOP world, then it is true. The reality is their stage performance just have too much similarity with other kpop gourds. I believe the most famous example must their performance on an awards ceremony in 2017. Their performance occidentally similar to Bigbang performance during their world tutor. I also dislike how their company handle every single rummers about BTS. Two examples to illustrate my point. In the end of 2017, BTS performance their hit song of year, but the stage design and performance details look like Bigbang stage performance during their tutor. Bigbang\u2019s agent published a personal post on a social media, and stated \u201c(BTS performance) took our hardworking\u201d and bigbang memers\u2019 sister retweet and liked this post. BTS fans, then, hacked their accounts immediately. The company they did nothing. During a live show, an audience noticed there was a birth control tool in BTS member apartment, and it was laid just on the floor and close to the trash box. Their company just using something else to cover this \u2018bad news\u2019 without clearly explanation. BTS claimed they are fan of Bigbang. But what have they do to their \u2018idol\u2019? When they released their new music video on Youtube, they add bigbang tag on their new video. Then fans like me searching Bigabang on Youtube and they will find BTS music video. Yes, one more thing, BTS member just accidentally to have similar hair color, dressing style and album ideology as bigbang. I guess this is what bigbang fans do. The second group is BLACKPINK. I like their songs very much. Comparing other girlish kpop group, I like BLACKPINK very much. I used to believe they really good at performance, they have high standard vocal and rap style. Until I discovered they did not live performed in any music program. I will complete my answer later. ",
