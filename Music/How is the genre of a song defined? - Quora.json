            "answer_text": "Summary First you define the characteristics of the song. Then you compare it against various \"clusters of characteristics\" (i.e., genre). Next, you adjust for marketing purposes and label it. Accuracy: medium. Importance: high. Details Characteristics When you listen to different songs, you can pick out broad defining characteristics. These are categorizable: Language: complex lyrics; poetic lyrics; accessible lyrics; oft-repeated phrases; \"heavy\" (challenging, complex, dark) versus \"light\" (fun, safe, comfortable) languageThemes: love and loss; joy and grief; politics; having a good time with friends; riding a horse; making and spending money; rivalry and self-praise; anger and despairMelody: standard chords; predominantly major scales; shifting between major and minor scales; unexpected chord progressions; use of dissonance; avoidance of dissonance; wide range of pitchesRhythm and pace: generally fast; generally slow; pounding bass; moving bass; steady rhythm Instruments: acoustic guitars, distortion, heavy/blurred percussion, synthesized instruments, violins, fiddles, sitarsVocal style: speaking-style, over-produced, screaming, chanting, operaticClusters Then you basically create a regression model to find which characteristics correlate most with which other ones. That is, you create clusters of characteristics. Okay, you don't actually have to run a regression, but that's the basic cognitive approach--we look for what characteristics tend to hang out with what other ones, and we try to see whether we can make predictions (or create reasonable expectations) based on that. For example: Light language with oft-repeated phrases; themes involve lust, friendship, dancing; predominantly major scales; little or no dissonance; steady pace; instruments include keyboard, drums, guitar, occasional strings; vocal style can involve auto-tuning, and is generally \"cantabile,\" with few breaks in rhythm, and no growling or screaming.Language includes references to doom, death and obscure classical mythology; heavy distortion on guitars; frenetic percussion that shifts rhythm to create \"song sections\" or \"movements\"; growling, shouting or screaming vocals that are a bit difficult to understandLanguage is simple and involves repeating key phrases, with \"punchlines,\" but outlines human condition in a few strokes; themes include love and loss, and quotidian pain and joy; using guitar or piano to create both melody and rhythm; use of seventh chords and suspensionsThe descriptions are broad, but from them, you can distinguish between pop, metal and blues. Accuracy Some songs are most definitely one genre or another, but other songs can be classified in more than one way. I recently encountered a band who is supposed to be \"folksy\" and a favorite of the hipster crowd, but I found that there was a lot of reggae influence in the music. Also, genre definitions change and blend over time. Sometimes I encounter the category \"Oldies\"--but that could mean anything, and the disco of the 70s was very different from the jazz standards of the 60s or the doo-wop of the 50s. So genre classifications can be useful, but they're not absolute. Marketing & Labeling To market something, you need to define your target audience and convince them that the thing you're selling is the thing they want. You're unlikely to convince a large group of Caucasian-American grandmothers to buy a black metal album, or to convince the punk community to buy bubble-gum pop. If you're marketing music that could fall into more than one genre, pick the genre that is some optimal combination of (a) more obvious to recognize and (b) more likely to appeal to your target audience. Even if you don't care about commercial sales, marketing and labeling the genre is important because it's how you signal. Most people don't have time/patience/money to sift through random samples of music; they gravitate to music that has certain characteristics. If you label your music properly, you'll draw an appreciative audience. With no labeling, you might never be discovered. With incorrect labeling, you'll be written off. Conclusion Sorting by genre is only broadly accurate, and a song's genre can be up for debate. If you want to explore songs based on their characteristics, but without the confounding influence of marketing, explore pandora.com.  Their algorithms are evolving, and are stronger for some genres rather  than others, but it's a great way to discover new music based on  characteristics that appeal to you. ",

            "answer_text": " (A full size pdf of this genre map can be found here: Page on Guardian ) One element can be added to Neha Bagchi's excellent answer: Genre is often defined using features or characteristics that are \"outside\" the song itself, such as the song's place of origin, the singer's traditions or stated influences, or the (sub)cultural practices that frame the song.  This is a historical/sociological mode of classification, rather than a strictly feature-based approach. So it is not unlike the process of making a family tree or an evolutionary taxonomy. Bats and birds, for instance, are classified differently despite having some features that are very similar (the ability to fly!). The same goes for certain forms of metal and punk -- they can sound similar and yet be classified as separate genres. This is also why a ska-influenced band can also be a punk band, and why unpopular music can be called pop. Skimming through the genre definitions on wikipedia or allmusic will no doubt turn up many cultural/historical distinctions -- such distinctions are often preferred by music fans without a background in music theory.
