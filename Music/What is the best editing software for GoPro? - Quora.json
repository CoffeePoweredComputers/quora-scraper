            "answer_text": "I love to use Premiere Pro. For just basic cuts I would recommend to just use iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, because less is more. The limitations will let you work faster. You will have to figure out less options and your screen will be less cluttered with things you don\u2019t need. But for me, I want to have it a little bit more advanced and I\u2019m really used to Adobe products (Illustrator and Photoshop are almost always open next to Premiere Pro). ",
