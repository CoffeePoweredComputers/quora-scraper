            "answer_text": "Nowhere! At least nowhere legally and even though there are good websites to download songs for free, they usually don\u2019t have the cover art! So what you need to do is download a song and slap the sucker on yourself. You can find a tutorial on youtube. The whole process lasts 5 secs with a program. You just select the song in program and drag the cover to the song. Can\u2019t remember the name but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it. ",
