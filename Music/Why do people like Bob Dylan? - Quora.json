            "answer_text": "If you want to understand how Bob Dylan became popular, you have to realize that the context in which he got big was half a century ago. It seems dated now, but at the time that antiestablishment stance was interesting and relatable. How do you think a fella in the sixties felt about politicians? But the main point that I want to underscore is that his lyricism is highly-regarded even by the standards of contemporary songwriters. His use of abstract symbolism to gird his many, many images allows him to connect disparate ideas into fascinating narratives that capture numerous perspectives of America through the lenses of socioeconomic class (Like a Rolling Stone), romance (too many to count), and his perspective as a working musician. If you take his imagery for granted you miss the complexity; to put it simply, his songs invite interpretation, and they have a depth that rewards the interpreter. There\u2019s a reason why the dude won a Nobel Prize, there\u2019s a reason why people think it was long overdue, and there\u2019s a reason why people think the award doesn't capture the significance of his achievements. If you don't judge Dylan by the context in which he released his albums, you won't understand what he did and, more importantly, you won't understand how contemporary lyricists built upon what he did. Dylan\u2019s influence on music around the world can't be overstated here. You don't have to like his stuff, but you should appreciate or respect it for what it is. ",

            "answer_text": "Forget the counter culture/politics. For me, (34, British) it\u2019s about the incredibly evocative imagery he creates with his lyrics. The stories he tells and the situations he evokes are like incredible, multi-layered dreams. Nothing really touches that - how he can put an image in my mind like no-one else. Then there are the more \u201cbase\u201d pleasures of the wonderful musicianship and arrangements (whether his, or by those he is surrounded by). Yeah he doesn\u2019t technically/conventionally have the best voice in the world, but that\u2019s irrelevant to me in this case. And boy does that voice have charisma and etch words into your brain!
