            "answer_text": "They\u2019re bombastic and they used to be called Rammstein-Flugschau after the horrific airshow disaster, (Ramstein air show disaster - Wikipedia), displaying a unique sense of fun - like calling your band \u201cBoston Marathon Bomb\u201d. They frolic in the same pool as Laibach, albeit in the shallow end. Rammstein is not my cup of arsenic. (Laibach, OTOH, is awesome!) But Satanic? I suppose if you recoil from KISS (Knights in Satan\u2019s Service - as I recall), then all the more so for these guys. But I think it confuses adolescent male anti-social angst with the diabolical. Easy to make that mistake, but they\u2019re not the same. ",
