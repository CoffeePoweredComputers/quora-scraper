            "answer_text": "Congratulations! Having a degree, any degree, qualifies you to be an exempt corporate employee. That means you can earn a salary and not have to submit a time card like hourly wage earners. However, you need to provide a set skills that corporations need. What other skills do you have? Administrative?Retail? Restaurant? What passions do you have? Veterinary? Automotive? Computing? Having a degree sets you apart from others who want entry-level jobs. Develop a new passion. You've proven you can complete a long-term endeavor. Use that accomplishment to get someone to take a chance and hire you for another challenge. If it helps my credibility, I also have a BA in Music. While earning my degree, I was also learning computing (this was Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 days when consumer digital audio was in its infancy), and working as a retail clerk. I worked retail until I finished my degree and was able to land a job doing desktop support. Learned about networking and then software and kept job hopping my way up to software implementation project management. The journey wasn't without some bumps and mistakes, but I really put that degree to work for me. Admittedly, it was easier back then because technology was booming and technology workers were scarce. But you can find work and earn your way to a desirable and stable career if you apply the same effort you exerted for your degree (maybe a little more). Wishing you luck! ",

            "answer_text": "A BA in Music is a nice to have degree if you enjoy music (like I do). If you get a teaching certificate, you can teach music to kids K through 12. With a Masters, you could probably teach at the Community College level. You would need a PhD to teach at a 4 year College. My piano teacher has a BA. He teaches private piano lessons. He is single and he inherited some money. He could not afford to live on teaching piano by itself. But, I am afraid a BA in music without any other credentials won\u2019t land you a job that will pay you much. Many years ago I faced a similar decision. I was interested in a Journalism degree. In fact, I have 12 hours of Journalism in my degree. I looked into job opportunities before I declared my major. There just weren\u2019t many jobs and the entry level salaries were dismal. I made the decision to get a BA in Business Management, which also interested me. I ended up with a 40 year railroad career. I still pay a great deal of attention to the news due to my background. Sorry, that\u2019s just the truth. You need to hear that before you get yourself in debt with College loans that you will struggle to repay. ",
