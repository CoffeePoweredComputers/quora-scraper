            "answer_text": "Quite an interesting question.. As it is said\u2026beauty lies within the eyes of beholder.. That exactly explains..what and who is beautiful and what makes it beautiful.. it totally depends on the person and his/her perceptions and emotions of viewing it. For eg. there might be a thing or person which was beautiful according to you in your past, but you hate it from the core of your heart at present, so does it means, that, that the thing/person which was so beautiful earlier has became ugly\u2026.not necessarily. its simply your perception and past experience which will help you in determining and analysing whether it is beautiful to you anymore or not.
