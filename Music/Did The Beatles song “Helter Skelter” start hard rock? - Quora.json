            "answer_text": "I agree hard rock was done before, no matter what Paul McCartney says, (assuming this is what triggered the post) Remember, Macca admitted he heard the Who had released the loudest, most raucous song ever (I can see for miles) and wanted to top it; so even there, he was a follower, not a pioneer. But the White Album was released in \u201868, and as already posted, how do you ignore the work from Cream, and Hendrix? How about the Who using multiple 100-watt Marshall amplifiers in 1965, something never done before? What about Blue Cheer (summertime blues), or Steppenwolf\u2019s Born to be Wild? Where do you begin? Have you ever sat in 4th row seats of the Jefferson Airplane in their prime (I have!)? There were a lot of loud and hard rock bands mid 60s! ",

In fact one need look no further than Deep Purple\u2019s first album \u201cshades of deep purple\u201d - that\u2019s a hard rock album and was released in September 1968, two months before \u201cthe white album\u201d. Other examples would include Iron Butterfly\u2019s \u201cin-a-gadda-da-vida\u201d released early \u201868, and Steppenwolf\u2019s hit \u201cborn to be wild\u201d issued 1967. ",

Some still say it was Jimmy Page not Dave; but he's never confirmed it and Dave insists it's all him to this day! ) The next candidate also from 1964, I think, would have to be \u201cCan't Explain\"/the Who! Hard rock as hell! You might be able to throw in \u201cMy Generation\u201d too? ( Actually you can go back to the 50\u2032s and say some of the \u201cGuitar Heroes\" of the day like Link Ray, Eddie Cochran and other bad boys were kinda hard rockabilly rockers too! ) No Ventures, no Santo & Johnny, no Dick Dale/King of the Surf Guitar! All too light weight, \u201cSurf\u201d guitar, pop! Great stuff but not even rock n' roll actually. ",

Hard rock morphed from the psych/garage style of a couple of years earlier, but by 1968 there was a lot of what would come to be known as hard rock and prototype-heavy metal, e.g., The Vanilla Fudge, The Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf, and especially The MC5.
