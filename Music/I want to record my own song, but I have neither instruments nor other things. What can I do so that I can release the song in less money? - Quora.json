So then you and the producer will be joint owners of that song. Then you could send it out to record labels or release it on Spotify or Amazon Music. You should send me a couple of your recorded vocals, then I could probably guide you better. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there! So with a minimum budget, you can do is to sing on the karaoke track which is available on youtube and record your voice through the normal headset in a laptop may be in a small room like bathroom suits well due to more reverb and reflections. Then merge your voice to karaoke and if you can afford a laptop then download free DAW any like REaper, Garageband in apple. Then you can process your vocal and make a master track and put it on your youtube channel with credits of karaoke music producer. ",
