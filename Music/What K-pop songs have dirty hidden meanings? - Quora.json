            "answer_text": "What K-pop songs have dirty hidden meanings?  I've talked about Twice's \u201cKnock Knock\" here before but this is my first time digging into it. The song is one thing but let's talk about the video first. It's a cute story of a bevy of adorable young ladies having a slumber party, followed by a snowball fight. It's a story that precedes the follow up \u201cT.T.\u201d video. And it's ultra cute. But it's disguising a very sexually charged song.   Wikipedia says: A sense of innocence was portrayed in the music video, which featured Twice having fun in a slumber party and snowball fight. Producer Park Jin-young, founder of JYP Entertainment, also had a short appearance. And that's it. There's no mention of the lyrics and what's being said therein. Here we go\u2026 The door closes at twelvePlease hurry up a bitKnock knock knock knockKnock on my door\u2026 What's happening at midnight? Why so late? What do men do at females' homes in the middle of the night? Mamamoo knows.  Continuing with \u201cKnock Knock.\u201d At night inside my mindThe door opens upI need somebody (Someone else) Anticipation? Thirst? You keep lingering aroundTaking a sneak peekKnock knock knock knockKnock on my door Not sure where this is going but hey\u2026how's the peeping, Tommy? Hey Tommy\u2026hows the peeping? Probably another playboyObviously just a bad boyI need some assurance (Knock knock) At least she's not a slut. She definitely desires a relationship here before\u2026knocking. Come again tomorrow and the day afterI will be ready and wait (knock knock)Baby, knock knock knock knock Wanna keep hearing it again!Knock on my door Jump to the afterglow. She has apparently enjoyed herself and can't wait for more. She's already thinking about tomorrow night. If this guy's knuckles don't get raw from knocking on doors, something else will. You pop in when I am aloneShake me right out of my mindNow is the perfect show time. Make it yours. HELLO! Never thought I'd say this but, dial it back a bit, Twice! (You come to me)Turn round round will only make you fall asleep. Homeboy's doing a hell of a job. Knock on my heart and open it upKnock hard! Bam! Bam! One more time! Bam! Bam! Lol come on now. Bam Bam?? I don't think we're talking about hitting doors anymore. Come again tomorrow and the day afterI will be ready and wait (knock knock) Good work, son. (I\u2019m freakin\u2019 freakin\u2019 out freakin\u2019 out out, knock knock)Knock knock knock knock on my doorKnock knock knock knock on my doorKnock knock knock knockknock on my doorKnock knock knock knockknock on my door She's freaking out. Now that's what I call horny. Godalmighty. Okay! Just so nobody thinks I'm making this up, I went around the internet to find some like ideas. I found these.    Yeah, let's talk about THAT!  There's finally the knock she (they??) were eagerly awaiting. Open the door and guess who it is. Not Kai.  JYP himself. He shows up very innocently, ready to rock out (I guess) at the slumber party. Okay, cute or something! But within the context of the song's lyrics, bro is there to get down with all nine of them! It's a weird mix! And don't say I'm reaching. You're telling me THIS GUY didn't plan that?  Him??? EWWWWWWW!!!!!!  (is Dahyun standing on a ladder?)  SLAM! Smart move, ladies. Jesus\u2026there are high school girls singing this. And yeah, I'm not even going into the story's continuation video \u201cT.T.\u201d Some outlets have blasted it for overtly sexual references, but I disagree with them. Except you know\u2026the Mina part, which I noticed on day one.  Yeah, Mina's part was\u2026ahem\u2026a little too much. (pauses as half of you go to YouTube to see it.) So yeah. \u201cKnock Knock\u201d is all about sex. In researching this, I also found that Red Velvet's \u201cIce Cream Cake\u201d is too. I'm dense sometimes, I should've noticed that. Thanks for being responsible. ",

            "answer_text": "Ice Cream Cake by Red Velvet Now this song might seem like a really cute song but when you read in between the lines, it isn\u2019t what it seems.  The verses aren\u2019t as bad as the chorus. The chorus is where it gets intense. Please give me that sweet taste, ice cream cakeWith a flavor that fits this special dayThe ice cream that\u2019s on my mouthMakes your heart pound and you\u2019ll come to meIt\u2019s so tasty come and chase me,I can\u2019t hold it in I scream, You screamGimme that, Gimme that Ice Cream Hmm\u2026 Let\u2019s think. Please give me that sweet taste, ice cream cake The first line is about them well \u2018eating\u2019 something that is sweet. I\u2019m pretty sure y\u2019all know what it is. The ice cream that\u2019s on my mouth Pretty self explanatory It\u2019s so tasty come and chase me \u2018come and chase me\u2019 that never sounds right. Specifically the word \u2018come\u2019. I can\u2019t hold it in I scream, you scream They are literally screaming which probably shows that they are definitely enjoying themselves. Summary: This song is about blowjobs. :)  Edit: I said I was gonna add another one so here ya go. Jam Jam by IU Bet you never thought a song by IU could have hidden dirty meanings. But too be honest, this song can be interpreted in two ways and an inappropriate meaning is one of them. The meaning isn\u2019t that intense though. I don\u2019t care, I'll become a fool, let's try everything Lets try everything I\u2019ll give IU a thumbs up for wanting to be experimental in a certain topic ;) We both know, there's a limit, it'll be over soonBefore I cool down, completely melt me (Babe) We both know there\u2019s a limit You \u2018both\u2019 know there\u2019s a limit and the other person seems to be addressed as \u2018babe\u2019. \u2018Completely melt me\u2019 are they that hot? Wowza. Tell me that you love meSay the pretty things smeared on your lipsSticky sticky, I\u2019ll keep it pickled \u2018Tell me that you love me\u2019 i love you. \u2018sticky sticky\u2019 and i\u2019m pretty sure she ain\u2019t talking bout glue here y\u2019all. I don\u2019t know natural, make it more provocative we just went 0\u2013100 real quick, i thought this song was meant to be subtle. for those who don\u2019t know the meaning of \u2018provocative\u2019 provocative /pr\u0259\u02c8v\u0252k\u0259t\u026av/ adjective: provocative intending to arouse sexual desire or interest.\"a provocative sidelong glance\" Similar: sexy, sexually arousing, sexually exciting, alluring, seductive It's all over my body (love love love) Why would love go all over your body? Wait. Oh no. Summary: She\u2019s talking about having sex.  ~k.l ",
