            "answer_text": "Disc by far. Drums last a long time and if adjusted properly they stay cool but they will never have the stopping power of disc brakes. It\u2019s extreme enough of a difference that I groan before a test drive when I hear a vehicle has drum brakes. The difference between disc and drum brakes is about the same as manual and boosted brakes. More importantly for some, disc are a lot easier to fix. There are no springs to deal with, they are cleaner and can be swapped in a few minutes. Drums need to be adjusted, are set up in different ways with heavy springs and wheel cylinders fail frequently and dump fluid all over everything. If you are just asking in general, than yes, discs are the way to go. Drums aren\u2019t bad by any means. For driving around town you can\u2019t beat disc. I live in No. Cali where almonds are grown. A lot of almond harvesting equipment runs old military axles with drums and they work just fine. A lot of forklifts still run drums and again, there is no issue. Older motorcycles run disc up front and drums in the back and it is terrible. Rear disc brakes on a bike make a world of difference. Drums tend to lock up more. You can lock up disc rear on a bike too but it\u2019s not as much a concern. A common upgrade on hotrods and old trucks is to replace the rear drums with discs and keep discs up front. I have two trucks with disc up front and drum in the back which means the front brakes account for probably 90% of the braking force. If I had the money I would do disc conversions on both with a new adjustable proportioning valves but alas, it\u2019s expensive and in reality it\u2019s not really worth it. To me. I just go through front pads quicker. So, yes, discs are where it\u2019s at. Are they end all/be all? No. It depends on wallet and application. ",

            "answer_text": "Drum brakes do have some advantages over disc brakes. Drum brakes are self-energized. Because the rotation of the drum pushes one brake pad against the drum it amplifies the stopping power. With the same effort a manual drum brake can produce more stopping power than a manual disc brake. This is the reason that drum brakes are still used in heavy duty commercial trucks. The self-energizing affect can be a disadvantage for control. A disc brake is relatively linear; if you press the pedal twice as hard you shold get twice as much stopping power. A drum brake may produce several times as much stopping power when you brake twice as hard. Threshold braking is the quickest way to stop. An skilled driver who is able to brake just short of locking up will stop faster than an unskilled driver or even a car with ABS brakes. Since a disc brake is more linear and predictable they are easier to threshold brake. Another problem with disc brakes is poor parking or emergency brake performance. I owned a Volvo that had disk brakes in front and both disk and drum brakes in rear. The drum brake was used only for the parking or emergency brake. Power assisted brakes mitigates the increased effort disc brakes require making this point moot except for parking/emergency brakes. Some light trucks still use drum brakes on the rear because it provides a strong parking/emergency brake and ABS mitigates the problem of unintentionally locking up non-linear drum brakes. ",
