            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! First, let me share with you my most recent published interview: I\u2019m A Defeatist But I Don\u2019t Have To Be: A Conversation With Eisley\u2019s Sherri DuPree-Bemis It\u2019s one I\u2019m proud of, because it\u2019s insightful, thought-provoking, and interesting. She\u2019s not an easy interview subject; she\u2019s often quite guarded. But she had a lot to say, because I knew what I was asking, and that only comes from doing the most important thing: Do your homework. Most artists take interviews during press cycles, and so the question you think might be one that\u2019s so original may very well be one that they\u2019ve been asked twenty times already in the week before your interview. Sometimes, when musicians get questions like this, they can get annoyed, bored, or rather apathetic in their responses. That\u2019s not to say certain questions should be off-limits, but you should find a way to take a question like that and flip it around a little bit, to offer a new dimension to it. For instance: What was it like to work in that big and fancy studio in California for your new album? That\u2019s kind of dull. Instead: You made your previous records in Denver in your home studio, and you did well with those records. For your new album, you made the decision to go to California to work in legendary studio X. What prompted that decision, considering how your other records were made? What did you gather from the experience from working in such a new way? See the difference? Same question, but a more nuanced approach, and one that leaves you open for more naturally flowing follow-up questions, as opposed to awkward ones. If you do your homework, you\u2019ll pick up on certain trends: What subjects have been the primary focus in recent interviewsWhat subjects are being avoided in recent interviewsWhat subjects are to be avoided based upon their responsesWhat does the artist like to talk about in generalWhat does the artist not like to talk about.Those last two are important. Some artists\u2014especially artists who have had previous bands or careers\u2014specifically do not want to talk about some subject matters, for a number of reasons. It\u2019s not relevant to what they\u2019re doing now.They don\u2019t like to focus on the past.Their previous projects were/are painful subjects.I should warn you, though, about something that you might discover when you do your research. In two cases I have experienced, both interview subjects had developed pat, steadfast answers to any variation to the questions you\u2019d asked. In one case, she offered a little variety, but didn\u2019t stray off script, and in another case\u2014writer Chuck Klosterman\u2014his interview answers were almost always the same. (I passed on interviewing him as a result, which was a shame.) But that homework bit? I can\u2019t stress it enough. That\u2019s the most important thing you can do\u2014not only to make an interview interesting, but to have fun. The more you read, the more you pick up on, and when you have a knowledge base, you can take that and run with it. Now, I will admit\u2014I have been interviewing musicians for about two decades, and I have a degree that specialized in oral histories, so I\u2019m kind of an expert at this. (Sorry for the humblebrag, but it is what it is.) In that interview above? It really was five questions on my part\u2014not creative editing. One of the most important things you have to learn to do is to shut up and listen. Learn how to make pointed, direct\u2014and simple\u2014questions, and sit back and listen to what your subject has to say. Good luck on your adventure! ",

Primary Objective: to elicit from the guest the emotional reason they write and sing songs. What joy do they get from it? What catharsis? It\u2019s actually the same as when you interview a truck driver. \u2014 What got you to write songs? (childhood trauma, happiness, money?) \u2014Can you remember the first time you wrote a song? Describe it to me. \u2014 Who gave you the support to keep writing in the beginning? Who did you play the early songs for? \u2014What do you feel like when you play one of your songs and people applaud? Is it an affirmation or an irritation? \u2014Professional songwriters spend years on their craft. Why not use their songs? \u2014 What is better about a song sung by the writer? \u2014Are you more of a singer or more of a song-writer? See where it goes. ",
