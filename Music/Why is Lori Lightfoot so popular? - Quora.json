Here are the results from yesterday\u2019s election:  Keep in mind that Chicago is a city of three million people, about 1.5 million of whom are registered voters. If \u201cnone of the above\u201d were an option, and people were forced to vote, she would have finished second to\u2026 literally no one. That being said, her rhetoric, at least, is much better than Preckwinkle. Preckwinkle said a lot of Bernie Sanders-esque things about \u201cmaking the rich pay their fair share.\u201d To the indifferent observer, like me (I don\u2019t support either of them), Preckwinkle\u2019s rhetoric was often about \u201cus vs. them.\u201d Police vs. people of color, rich vs. poor, downtown vs. everyone else, etc\u2026 Lightfoot\u2019s rhetoric was more focused on \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d Even though I don\u2019t believe she actually thinks that, it was still refreshing to hear a Chicago politician not demonize the rich/police/downtown business district.

It\u2019s what eventually drove me into the suburbs. Now the last of the old school machine politicians is going to prison, O\u2019connor Who is crooked as hell lost his election as did Arena and a few others are going down with Burke. She\u2019ll be starting with a lot of fresh faces that aren\u2019t entrenched in the cesspool is favors for campaign donations, I think knowing she has actually put aldermen in jail will keep the new people in line. She\u2019s popular because we\u2019re hopeful\u2026 the Republicans are even hopeful that the culture will shift, that\u2019s all we all want after watching the fat cats get richer and the neighborhoods get the leftover scraps ",
