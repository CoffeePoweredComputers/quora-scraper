            "answer_text": "A2A: Loss of access to falsetto is often the first sign of vocal distress. If you\u2019ve been trying to extend another part of your vocal range and this has been the result then perhaps you\u2019ve been overdoing it. I\u2019d suggest calming things right down in that regard and allow some time for the voice to recover. If your falsetto hasn\u2019t returned to normal after a couple of weeks, then you may need to have your voice medically checked by an ENT (Ear Nose Throat) doctor and work with a reputable vocal coach in order to work on your technical development more safely & sustainably.

            "answer_text": "I have read Kimberly\u2019s responses to questions like these, and I again concur with her assessment. It is best to have an ENT (otolaryngologist) see what is happening, as this could be a medical issue that a voice teacher is not equipped to handle. Only after taking the ENT\u2019s recommendations would I then go back to working with a voice teacher. ",
