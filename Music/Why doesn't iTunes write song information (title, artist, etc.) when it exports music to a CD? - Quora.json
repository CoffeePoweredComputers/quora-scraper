            "answer_text": "When you burn an MP3 CD it will, but when you burn an Audio CD it will not. When you burn a Data CD or MP3 CD, it will include the metadata that is in your iTune for those tracks. Even when you include CD Text, it doesn't guarantee that your CD player will be able to read it. That's going to depend on your CD player. Finally, if you're burning CDs and then importing them on someone else's machine, you would be better off burning an MP3 or Data CD, which will insure that the metadata goes along with the files. ",
