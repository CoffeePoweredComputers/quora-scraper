            "answer_text": "In my opinion, Depending on your style of play and wants (single coil or humbucker pickups, a Tremelo system or a hard tail etc) I HIGHLY recommend Epiphone. Especially if you\u2019re looking for that Les Paul feel and sound. I was in a working band and only had my \u201880\u2019s Kramer. We play songs with lots of different tunings and it was tough tuning on stage between songs. Some songs had open chord tunings and getting her in tune while the singer bantered was a real PIA. But I couldn\u2019t afford to get another guitar. The bass player offered to let me use his Sam Ash credit offer of a year interest free and I reluctantly accepted his gracious offer. I still wanted to go as cheap as possible. I tried several different guitars. I eventually grab an Epiphone Les Paul Standard with a beautiful flamed maple cap and it was as if lights sudden brightened 1000 percent brighter. It just felt \u201cRight\u201d. And it was only $349 on sale. Fast forward almost 20 years and I STILL have her. I would save her from a house fire BEFORE a couple of my Gibson LP\u2019s, she just plays, feels and sounds beautiful to me. The action is so low you can barely slide a credit card between the 22nd fret and the strings. If you are looking for a single coil Strat type, I would recommend trying Squires and Ibanez\u2019s offerings. Both are affordable, and quality instruments. I also suggest looking on the used market for any if the brands I mentioned first. There are TONS of them out there and they can be had real cheap. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Get the cheaper version of a good guitar you eventually want to buy. Why? Because then you can upgrade parts and maybe the parts will still be useful when you buy your dream guitar. And when you get your dream guitar, your cheaper guitar will be a close backup - a spare if you go gigging. Also, the cheaper guitar is generally the same shape and lighter. You get to try out the shape under practice/gigging conditions. For example, if the cheaper/lighter one is too heavy for comfort or some other fitting issues, then maybe that dream guitar is not for you. Time to come up with another dream guitar. Of course, not everything is interchangeable so you have to investigate. Parts like pickups, locking tuners, etc can be interchangeable. If the pickup dies, you can switch guitar or swap parts so one guitar will serve as a depot of parts for the second guitar. For example, I wanted to try a new nut. I put it on my cheap guitar first. Test it out. Then I buy the same nut for my expensive guitar. I buy locking tuners or pickups for my expensive guitar, give the cheaper guitar the removed parts from the expensive guitar. I want to try heavier gauge strings but I need to cut the nut wider - I do it to my cheap guitar first. At this stage, I love my so call \u201ccheap guitar\u201d as much as my \u201cexpensive one.\u201d They are all my children. I try to provide unique insights. If you like my answer, I would appreciate an upvote. ",
