            "answer_text": "Hip hop is entertainment after all, so the \"facts\" in these songs should be taken with a grain of salt. Having said that, the following autobiographical songs are artful, interesting and feel authentic. Immortal Technique - You Never Know Immortal Technique narrates the tragedy of his first love and his short period of incarceration. I won't ruin the end of the story for you, it's worth a virgin listen.  I went on with my life, college and my career Ended up locked up like an animal for a year Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer Then I got sent to the hole, when my exit was near At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared The Game - Ol' English The Game uses the name of a particular brand of malt liquor to tie together the death of three loved ones and his formative years.  Once upon a time in the projects yo I watched my uncle Greg put D's on his six-fo' I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain Chopped crack and watched \"Colors\" 'til I soaked up game Drove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model Used to let me kill the corner of his 40-ounce bottle On the weekend him and my pops flashed the 'Vette 'Til one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death Jay-Z - You Must Love Me Jay-Z loves to talk about himself, so I submit yet another song where he exposes part of his life story. In this narrative he describes past actions surrounding the drug trade that weigh on his conscience: selling to his mother, shooting a childhood friend, and using his lady as a mule.  All you did was motivate me, \"Don't let 'em hold you back\" What I do? I turned around and I sold you crack I was a bastard for that, still I'm drowning in shame Just remember one thing now, you are not to blame You was newly seperated, tryin' to escape ya worldAnd through my thirst I didn't help you, I just made things worse  Andre 3000 - A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre The more eccentric member of OutKast describes his interactions with love and art in the years surrounding the creation of OutKast. This chronicle includes a candid take on his relationship with Erykah Badu and an explanation of his transformation from rapping pimp to eclectic musician.  I get invited to a club where emcees at And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head Similar to the turban that I covered up my dredz with Which I was rocking at the time When I was going through them phases trying to find Anything that seemed real in the world Still searching, but I started liking this girl Now you know her as Erykah on and on Badu Call Tyrone on the phone why you Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name We're young, in love, in short we had fun No regrets, no abortion, had a son By the name of Seven, now he's five By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six You do the arithmetic ",

            "answer_text": "Nas - Nas Is Like (http://bit.ly/dalbko)  is basically the defining autobiographical track from Hip Hop's second Golden Era. It signified both the close of that era (basically, all good hip hop) as well as Nas verbally committing to 'going out' (aka going commercial) and justifying it on a track that encompasses the underground sensabilities (DJ Premier on production) of the era. Just starting the track sets the tone for a typically Nas (early Nas) introspective, intelligent theme: Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and endAs far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain My plateau, and also, what defines my name First it was Nasty, but times have changed Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame Essentially, this track is the only reason the hardcore hip hop heads (aka: Illmatic as the defining album of Golden Era II, lyrically & musically) didn't fully castigate Nas for such embarrassing career moves as Oochie Wallie, Nastradamous, etc).
