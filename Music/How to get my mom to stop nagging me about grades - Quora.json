            "answer_text": "Is your work ethic bad? And how easy is it to speak with your mother - she sounds as if she's reacting - emotionally - and when people do that it can be very hard to talk sense to them.The world has changed since your mother was in school and likely she's very aware of that. There's little that can be assumed anymore - one can't assume that because a person comes from a stable, self-sufficient family that they will grow up and go on to their own stable, self-sufficient life. For one representative statistic - in 1975 Harvard received about 14,000 applications - in 2015 it received about 37,000 applications. How much more difficult is it to get into Harvard now than it was back in the day? You might not have any interest in Harvard but that illustrates the issue - there is ever-rising competition for entrance into colleges and universities, graduate schools and professional schools. That can worry people and for some parents it makes them so worried they live on the edge of frantic about it. The only thing that brings them comfort in the face of it is steady unfailing stream of As and when they see a B - they react emotionally, it threatens them, their worry level goes up exponentially. Talking to someone who is feeling that way is not easy. You could ask - \"What - other than this B - makes you say my work ethic is bad? What - other than baseball - do I do besides study? I'm not sure that it's realistic or fair to think that every time I get a B that I've done something so horribly wrong that my one form of exercise - my one athletic pursuit - should be cut off.\"If that goes well you could go on to say \"I think you might looking for something to blame - for this B and you blame me. Do you think I don't care about school? Can you point to anything in my behavior that suggests to you I don't care about school? Do my teachers say that to you? I don't think so. You accuse of something pretty bad - a bad work ethic - that hurts to hear -it's like you're attacking me. . If you want to get mad and punch a pillow fine but you take emotional punches at me - when I get a B. \" And if that goes well you can add ' \"Is a B worth beating me up for? Do you believe that if you beat me up emotionally over a B that I'll do something different? I'm already working hard - ask my teachers. Or are you just beating me up just because you get so worried and worked up? I want you to be proud of me but I don't want you to beat me up when you should be punching a pillow. It's time to start trusting me - I'm no slacker.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Getting As, A-s and Bs does not indicate that your work ethic is bad. As long as you are doing the best you can on your schoolwork, your mom should not be demanding perfection. Is there an underlying reason your mom is requiring you get straight As?  Are you going to be applying to a competitive college that requires a 4.0 to get accepted?  Are you only going to be able to afford to go to college if you get a scholarship that requires a 4.0 average? Being well-rounded is better for most college applications that aren\u2019t based purely on the highest possible grade average.  Playing baseball is a huge plus for applications and scholarships because it shows an ability to manage your time and that you are more than studying by actually being part of a team and the community at large. You can start by telling your mom that her constant nagging and demand for absolute perfection is interfering with your studies, crushing your spirit and eroding your work ethic.  You can tell her that baseball helps keep you in shape and it refocuses your brain so that when you do return to studying, you are mentally refreshed which makes your brain more receptive to the subjects you are studying. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Thank her! Seriously go give her a hug and thank her as soon as possible. She cares for you and its trying to teach you valuable life skills that many parents do not know or care about. It sounds like you are very capable at getting good grades. She probably isn't as worried about what those grades can do for you but more so in developing your self discipline. She knows she won't be there to give you a kick in the butt every time you need it so instilling these skills now is the only option. Intelligence means nothing without the will to use it. And after you give her a hug and thank her get to work on improving your grades (no matter how high they might be without her having to tell you. This will show that you ate listening and truly do appreciate her wisdom. ",

When I went to college they were only interested in ACT scores. Although I went to a community college for Computers. I have had no job ask about what my grades were in college. Just what degree I had and previous experience. I think more info is needed. ",
