            "answer_text": "I would say you probably don\u2019t need to worry about where you\u2019re from. The principles of making great music, and promoting it online (social media/playlists, maybe set up a youtube channel or facebook/instagram page and share clips of your music and who you are,) as well as locally using more traditional methods (posters, radio play, concerts), should apply regardless of where you are the world nowadays. I would recommend identifying some existing producers from India, and try to identify and analyse what techniques they are using, and seeing if there are any electronic open mic nights or other opportunities to get out and get your music heard, if you play live. If you just want to make music, then your approach could be more focused on finding local DJs who would be willing to get to know your stuff. You could also try beat-selling websites such as Beatstars, or similar. Overall, I am not aware of any reasons why being from India would be a blockage for your success, but maybe somebody else knows what I\u2019m missing. I wish you all the best in your journey. ",
