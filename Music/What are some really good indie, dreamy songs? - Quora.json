Fun fact: The video and sound were recorded at the same time! You can hear the smiles as he sings too. This band is one of those that sound just as good live as they do recorded. This song though, oh it still gives me chills. And I\u2019ve listened to it dozens of times.  These songs sound best with good headphones by the way. The bass is beautiful, especially in the second one. ",

It feels so ethereal yet maintains a good level of earthiness at the same time, which is something that isn\u2019t as common as it appears. ",
