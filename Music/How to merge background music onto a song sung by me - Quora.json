            "answer_text": "THINGS YOU NEED TO HAVE : 1.) A D.A.W : daw(digital audio workstation) is like a music production software which you can use to create and/or edit music2.) the instrumental and your vocals : did i mention something pretty obvious ? :p yes i did !  now you can get a freeware DAW like AUDACITY which is pretty easy for someone who doesn't have any prior experience in using DAWs  now WHAT YOU WANNA DO :1. If you haven't already then get a good microphone for a better quality of sound , however this is beside the field of the question and just my advice !2. You will be able to see tracks in audacity lay down your instrumental in one of those and then get ready with your mic to hit the record button ! additional things : make sure to adjust the volumes of the instrumental and vocals to the point where it doesn't sound all hastily mixed up ! using audacity is pretty easy but if you face any problems check out some tutorials on youtube or maybe ask someone on quora ! best of luck ",
