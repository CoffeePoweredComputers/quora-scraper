            "answer_text": "I don't see how Dixie is racist? It is an affectionate name for the South from the shortened Mason Dixon line and has absolutely no derogatory sense toward black folk. You people want to wipe the whole history of the South off the map because you are ashamed of the past, so you pretend it never happened. Events in the South were important to the formation of the US into the great country it is (or at least was). You are going down a similar path to Russia. During the communist regime, they tried to pretend Imperialist Russia never happened. Now they have come to their senses and see Imperialist Russia in the historical context it should be seen and recognise it's importance in the formation of Russia. I only hope Americans can come to their senses. You don't have to condone slavery and you shouln\u2019t, but you should recognise it happened and celebrate the fact that eventually America had the sense to come out if it. There was a lot of blood shed and heartache because people believed in the issue. By pretending it never happened, you also deny these people's legacy. ",

While I don\u2019t think Blake is anything like a bigot, it wouldn\u2019t be at all surprising if there were some unexamined bits of racism in his psyche that came out in that song. ",
