            "answer_text": "I can see how it could improve your breath control and train your ear to pitches. Breath control by being able to whistle in a steady equal volume flow and ear training by simply imitating the pitches of a song as accurate as you can. It would improve more your mind's perception of melodies than it would your actual voice. But breath and good ear is only part of good singing. It depends how good you want to be because great whistling won't get you connected through your vocal breaks into your mixed voice, you will still have stain, undeveloped singing muscles, and many other hindrances. I guess the answer is yes if you only want to improve your singing from what you can benefit from whistling which is not much honestly. Doing proper vocal exercises for example \"lip rolls\" will better your voice way way more than whistling because lip rolls create a steady air flow, connect your vocal registers, and your ear is being trained as you do scales. My advice is don't use whistling as an exercise to improve your voice, whistle for fun and if you get really good at whistling that's impressive, singing with the birds i bet is awesome. To improve in singing I recommend learning the basics of how the vocal folds work and how they develope for better singing and the majority of your questions about singing improvement will be answered.

            "answer_text": "Whistling will improve your whistling. Singing is the act of the vocal folds hitting together, which does not happen during whistling. You could make an argument that whistling can help with your breath support, but I personally find that idea ridiculous. If you want to get better at singing, then sing. ",
