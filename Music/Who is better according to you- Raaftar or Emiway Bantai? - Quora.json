            "answer_text": "Disclaimer first: I appreciate both of them, their dedication and a desire to stand out. Both of them started off with so much at stake, a career people wouldn\u2019t approve of, and a path which doesn\u2019t give immediate/prolong success in India. But hey, if you do it right, 5 songs are enough! Most of you may go with Bantai, as he is young, made it totally on his own and has been excelling solo, and maybe because Raftaar had exposure due to \u201cMafia Mundeer\u201d. Also, this answer is in no way going to compare their success as it is unfair. Raftaar has been established for years, he is on the other side of the ocean of success. Bantai is comparatively young and will definitely add many more laurels in the years to come. I appreciate both of them as amazing entertainers. But, i like to see what success does to people. How they act and react when they are on top. Listen to the diss tracks from Bantai and you\u2019d realise he went a little overboard against Raftaar. In this industry, Raftaar was a senior, a successful rapper whose mocking only boosted Bantai\u2019s exposure, and he could just take it lightly and let it go, maybe. Not sure what happened, maybe people around him provoked him to avenge the insult or whatever, he lost track of what he was saying and against who. Whereas all Raftaar did was to help out a younger talent, getting him known even more. When the senior gives you a nudge, you don\u2019t try to beat the shit out of him to prove you are better. ",
