            "answer_text": "If you want to know what is the \u201cbest,\u201d or most popular song of military veterans, go to some retirement ceremonies, and hear what is played. At one time, Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless The USA,\u201d was very popular. (I\u2019ve heard it again some more recently.) At some point after 9\u201311, some of Toby Keith\u2019s work was unapologetically played. Being older, more traditional, and having served in only the one service, I chose the Air Force Hymn (not the Anthem) for the opening, as being more reverent, more consistent with the theme of my ceremony. We did play (and sang) the Air Force Anthem at the end of the ceremony, however. So, the one clarification most helpful to answering your question is whether you are looking for THE ONE SONG for all veterans? If it has to be the same song for everyone, then the Star Spangled Banner is the appropriate choice. Unless someone writes a popular song about the US Constitution (an unlikely prospect, it would seem), the flag that flies over our installations and cemeteries, and drapes our coffins, and fills our shadowboxes with meaning, is the best choice we have.

            "answer_text": "There are several songs, that come to mind. I was in the Army, and my preferences, would be: Blood Upon The Risers,\u201d ANY track, from Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler\u2019s Ballad of the Green Berets,\u201d And The Casons Went Rolling Along, George M. Cohen's, \u201cYou're A GRAND OLD FLAG,\u201d \u201cAmerica, Why I Live Her.\u201d by John Wayne. Anything that mentions American patriotism. Other veterans may feel the same way, about their own service songs. Or JUST say thank you for your service. ",
