            "answer_text": "While there are people who are super talented at writing lyrics, it\u2019s something that most people can do to a certain extent, so unless you can also write songs, it\u2019s not that likely that you\u2019ll be able to sell lyrics alone. Instead what you should look for is composers that don\u2019t feel comfortable with writing lyrics, to collaborate with. Try West Coast Songwriters, or similar organizations. Go to places with open mic nights to mingle. Post on related boards (physical boards and online boards) related to songwriting and put it out there that you\u2019re looking for someone to collaborate with. I\u2019ve always wished I could do this sort of thing - not because I thought I could make a living out of it, but because I enjoy writing song lyrics. However, I can admit to myself that sometimes things I write have cheesy parts that make me groan, and I also know that lots of pop and country lyrics out there could have been written by pretty much anybody with some skills. Or, maybe I am really good at it and I\u2019ve missed out on some opportunity because I didn\u2019t have enough faith or desire to do music. If you want to find out, the only way is to delve into researching the music business and start making connections now. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! I agree very much with both comments. I\u2019ve been in the songwriting and music publishing business\u2019 for over a decade and I don\u2019t know of any instances where someone\u2019s lyrics were \u201csold.\u201d If you\u2019re simply interested in selling your lyrics as is, as John Pape said\u2026that\u2019s technically poetry\u2026but you can absolutely try to do that! If you\u2019re more interested in having your lyrics used in a song(s), I would recommend co writing. I have many friends who only write lyrics that make a fine living as songwriters! Here\u2019s a link to a story on Liz Rose. She is a lyricist (doesn\u2019t play an instrument) and co-worte almost every song on Taylor Swift\u2019s first album! The Story of Liz Rose\u2026 Inspiring!!! How to find co-writers\u2026that\u2019s a whole different topic. Go to singer/songwriter nights at local venues, join songwriting organizations, etc. I hope this was helpful - good luck! ",
