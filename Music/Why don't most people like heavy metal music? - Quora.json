            "answer_text": "I say that no matter what the original purpose for the creation of heavy metal once has been, you can not expect anyone to like metal music. We have so many music genres that people only have so much time to explore several genres to a certain extent and personal interest depth. What\u2019s more that metal as a genre is not well known all over the world. Metal is mostly known on western areas or certain eastern regions like Japan for an example or Russia and also mostly Nordic countries like Finland etc. You could insert any other genre in place of metal and get the same or similar answers. But since you\u2019re asking about metal let me get more specific on metal and some issues that occur. First off - the fan base. It is an impenetrable wall of arguments paired with a hot sticky mass of elitism to keep it impenetrable. You wanna have to deal with too many arguments before you eventually decide to give it a try or to leave it behind. What makes it so bad is how metal is presented. Something that was not this bad in the 80s. When I was young and came about people who wore band shirts you could simply ask them about that band and they maybe had a \u201cwalkman\u201d and let you listen. Yet they did not throw a fit if you were not so interested. Also they had a varied mix of metal. From old school metal (insanely deemed hard rock today) down to thrash, speed and power metal. There was also no argumentative barrier between people who loved the mainstream bands and those who preferred the lesser mainstream bands. Metal was pretty popular anyway in the 80s. And I don\u2019t see how that has changed. What did change is the genres in metal that get heralded and pretended to be the be all end of metal. Like death or black metal or highly technical guitar stuff that eventually makes no more sense but being just technical. I saw that shift in fan behavior during the 90s. You loved the than popular power metal that had some slices of operatic singing, some good keyboard works and stuff? It was called \u201cpussy metal\u201d. The fan base started to split more and more. It all became a kinder garden at one point. Look at band leaders and singers like Corey Taylor. He spills his opinion as if they were facts. And now all the fans as well. It\u2019s like the fans are getting close minded more and more with every year passing, turning into fictional dragons protecting their treasure. Their PRECIOUS! Like I said even bands once acknowledged for being up in the metal game are now deemed \u201crock\u201d or \u201chard rock\u201d to make a better separation between the real \u201ctrue\u201d metal music from the \u201cnot so metal\u201d stuff. Another example is putting the once simply commercial term \u201chair metal\u201d for bands you don\u2019t like. When the hair in hair metal does not even have a meaning towards the metal style at all. It should just mark the \u201cmore commercial\u201d outsiders in terms of \u201cold school metal\u201d. Do you want to be identified with such hard headed fans? Where there is a cult about being \u201ctrue\u201d VS \u201cfake\u201d? Of course there are many serious and upright metal heads. But finding them to get the good entrance into metal world can be kinda annoying today. Most metal fans today are ranting kids online having convoluted opinions. What also sticks is the old idea that metal is meant to be kinda \u201canti social\u201d whereas I can not defend that position. Yet most people - let us be honest - are social beings and want to create connections or also have music that creates a friendly atmosphere where people of different ages and ideas meet and socialize. Metal is also a good opportunity to meet new people if you like to attend concerts and all. But in terms of social or cultural reflecting background metal is just not there. And it is also only one out of so many genres. I prefer actually electronic music, rock and jazz for the most and anything in between since that creates many different ideas in terms of music covering the last 40 decades alone. For me personally metal has no deeper meaning in my life anymore. It was different once. I can now point to the musical characteristics that many people just don\u2019t like (or say the stuff modern metal heads go for to feel proud and special): the guitars: today you get so many more harsh and stuffed riffs and all. Compared to that, old Black Sabbath sounds like a toothless tiger. But only if the later stuff is the bee all end for you. Not so much for me.the vocals: What is the deal with heralding vocals that are either screamed, growled or otherwise delivered in some sort of guttural animal like manner? Most people don\u2019t like vocals being transported in a none civilized way. And some metal bands can be very much all about that. Just see what you get if you ask modern metal kids and the bands they brag about.the lyrics: Most metal bands seem to transport the usual stuff we also get in radio music. Yes I dare say that. Yet some bands content consists of conspiracy theories, even though in a tongue in cheek manner. But there are many bands who take this way too serious. And often times it is hard to separate one from another. And what is the deal with black and death metal lyrics? They are specific in their topics and may not appeal to anyone anyway. Not even in the vast metal community.the community: I already gave some aspects away. But other than listening to \u201cmetal\u201d (and not really agreeing on anything at all, except that it has to be \u201csuperior\u201d music) there is nothing real about this community. The music has become a fetish. Most people are not fetishists. They want to listen to music for it being music and not their \u201clife essence\u201d.I agree that my answer does seem biased. But I admit I do have a strong opinion. And as long as metal doe snot get promoted more clever and less biased from the fan side on, most people will just stay away. But hey, maybe that is the goal. To keep most people out of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it requires patience and intelligence and the majority of the population don\u2019t possess either of those virtues . They only want something that is gonna give them instant gratification so just a three and a half minute generic pop song is about all their tiny little pea sized brains are able to handle . In the 1970\u2019s People were exactly the same about Progressive rock , now classic rock. The majority just didn\u2019t get it & they were happy listening to either pretend rock such as Slade , Wizard , Mud , The Sweet etc . or very cheesy Pop music such as Abba , The Bee Gee\u2019s and The Grease Soundtrack where as genuine music fans were buying LP\u2019s by Rush , Yes , Aerosmith ( Long before they started making power-ballads for big blockbuster movies , Wishbone Ash , Captain Beef heart , Pink Floyd , Deep Purple & Led Zeppelin . On first play a lot of those artists songs don\u2019t instantly click with you but in those days the main format for listening to music was vinyl and you had to put the record on , sit on your bean bag and melt into in and just let one track run into the next and then certain tracks just click but you get your reward from multiple listens and eventually they will become favourite songs and they will be your favourite bands and exactly the same with Metal but I think the problem with Metal is that a lot of people don\u2019t like to be screamed at or shouted at which I guess is kind of understandable but there a lot of bands known for that style of singing who do in fact do some songs in clean vocal styles rather than the shouting and screamy vocals but I have been a fan since I was 14 years old , started off with Aerosmith and Guns N roses then went to Metallica then Nu Metal started so I got distracted by a lot of those Bands who I still do listen to from time to time . I am having a KoRn phase again I have been listening to a lot of their albums a lot recently and am hearing them differently now as a late 30\u2019s adult as opposed to when I was 15 and started buying their music I loved it for all the swearing but now their music put\u2019s me in a fairly dark place and am able to feel the emotions that Jonathan Davies was going through at the time but also Groove Metal is pretty awesome to bands such as Pantera , Machine Head and Lamb of God plus discovering a lot of the 80\u2019s thrash bands that I overlooked at the time . When I go around charity shops I very rarely find any Metal or alternative Rock music , it is usually always just manufactured throw away pop music played on daytime radio it\u2019s as if the fans of that kind of top 40 music are totally fickle as they get bored very quickly so I think they are basically proving that their music is unfettered Dog shit .
