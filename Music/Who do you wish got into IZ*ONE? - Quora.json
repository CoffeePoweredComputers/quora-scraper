            "answer_text": "Firstly, I love IZ*ONE and I hated seeing complaints about the lineup after Produce 48. Of course, others deserved to debut but complaining changes nothing and only discredits the hard work of the 12 girls that make up IZ*ONE. If a single member didn\u2019t make it in, they would be a completely different group - not the IZ*ONE that so many people love. That being said, I can admit that there are girls I wish got into the lineup. 1. Lee Kaeun  Since I\u2019m a Pledis stan, she was my top pick even before Produce 48 started. She continually proved that she would be a useful member. Her fluency in Japanese was shown and praised throughout. The way she got along with the others and took care of them well proved that she would be a great leader. Even though she wanted to be center, she pushed that aside and comforted Sakura telling her that she deserved the position. She is talented, yes, but most importantly she deserves to shine on stage and fulfil her simple desire to perform. And you just know that Pledis won\u2019t let her do that. 2. Wang Yiren  IZ*ONE\u2019s a global girl group, right? Adding Yiren would increase their diversity - not just Korean-Japanese, but adding in that Chinese flair (like her specialty: Chinese dance). Like I.O.I had Jieqiong and Wanna One had Guanlin (who\u2019s Taiwanese, but the point stands), Yiren in the lineup would have made IZ*ONE all the more unique. Not to mention, her addition would have made IZ*ONE more of a visual group - though obviously, the 12 in IZ*ONE are beautiful. She\u2019s the only one in all three seasons to get the top rank in visuals and not get into the final lineup. Also, I love the interactions between labelmates in the groups Produce makes, and I would have liked to see Yena and her together talking about their trainee days like how Eunbi and Chaewon do. That being said, I\u2019m glad to see her in EVERGLOW and am excited to see her and Sihyeon\u2019s debut there. [Update: EVERGLOW\u2019s fantastic and quickly becoming one of my favourite groups!] 3. Miyazaki Miho  I fell in love with her watching AKBINGO!. She has a hilarious character for variety - rebellious and talks back, but underneath is a sweet girl - the nickname \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 explains it all. Her lack of popularity in AKB48 despite debuting and working hard for more than a decade\u2026 she deserved more. She also loves K-pop and learned Korean, to the point that she got hate for \u2018betraying Japan\u2019. I\u2019m understating this a lot, just read this if you don\u2019t know it already. What better revenge than to represent Japan in IZ*ONE while using those Korean skills to their full potential? Hearing her great vocals and clear Korean pronunciation in Produce48 made me root for her even harder. Other: My brother wanted Takahashi Juri.  She fits their concept well, she has fantastic visuals and has shown a passion for the Korean language/Kpop. I always thought she was really funny in AKB48 - her temper\u2019s hilarious - and she has a great talent for variety shows. Personally, I\u2019m okay with her not being in IZ*ONE because Team B needs their leader and she\u2019s doing well in AKB right now. [Update: She\u2019s in Rocket Punch \u2014 stream \u2018Bim Bam Bum\u2019!] IZ*ONE got some heat for only having 1/4 of their lineup being Japanese (in comparison, 1/3 of TWICE is Japanese and they don\u2019t have the Korean/Japanese concept like IZ*ONE does). The addition of any Japanese contestants would be good and would show more appreciation for the girls that came from overseas and basically started from square one. I also love other contestants (Park Minji owns my whole heart), but these are the ones that I could actually see as members of IZ*ONE. ",

            "answer_text": "I only really want IZ*ONE as it is now, but looking back on Produce 48 there are definitely some trainees I thought deserved it (but tbh everyone deserved it) or that I liked, and that I really want to see succeed in future or at least see at all\u2026 Han Chowon (Cube ent.) Chowon was always an amazing trainee who ranked very high at the end and tbh it would be pretty probable if she was one of the people who didn\u2019t make it because of rigging, but we\u2019ll never know. She constantly showed her talent and good personality and leadership, etc. From when she lead the Boombayah team 2 to an unexpected victory, to her incredible vocals in position evaluation to the sacrifice she made to rap for Rumor team (and owned it), and her unforgettable Madewaaaa. I really don\u2019t want to imagine any differences in IZ*ONE than it is now, but strangely, I could imagine liking an IZ*ONE with Chowon in it. Of course, I now hope to see her succeed in future, but unfortunately not much has come up, and since she\u2019s in Cube it may be a while since they already have CLC and (G)I-dle (which is still an early group) it may be a while. 2. Miyu Takeuchi (AKB48/Mystic ent.)  I remember in the past many people arguing Miyu should\u2019ve made it, but I never quite saw it. I always knew she was an incredible singer and all but I guess I never saw stuff that stood out to me, however, recently, ever since she joined Mystic and came back to Korea it made me realise that she has a lot of passion for music and coherently had a lot of determination and hopes in Produce 48, which made me really want to see her do well She is in a company now, who is definitely planning to debut her sometime soon, which is good. I don\u2019t know how long it will take, but hopefully she does well when it comes. Also, I should quickly point out a similar feeling for Takahashi Juri, I\u2019m just lazy and don\u2019t wanna make an extra area for her. Also, she\u2019s already doing well in Rocket Punch and I want to see them get even more attention. What really stands out about Rocket Punch to me isn\u2019t their music, but they are actually super funny as a group. 3. Kim Nayoung (Banana Culture)  Kim Nayoung for me was always that one girl who was just my favourite, but I never wanted to fully support her only, because I knew she wouldn\u2019t make it to debut, but that being said her evolution through the show was incredible and she ended up all the way at rank 21 (might of even be higher because of rigging, who knows?) and when she was eliminated with Kim Doah (another fantastic trainee) it was really funny and sweet. Sadly, despite thinking I would, I haven\u2019t seen much of her nowadays, which is kinda sad, but she is young and has a lot of talent and hopefully she makes a return 4. Go Yujin (Blockberry Creative/8D ent.)  Go Yujin had a hard time on Produce 48, being eliminated so prematurely (which I now hope was somewhat due to rigging) and not being able to Rumor, which she would\u2019ve done so well. I don\u2019t wish she made it to IZ*ONE or anything, I just wanted to see her go further or succeed. And tbh, she looked like she might have a good future after Produce 48, because she joined 8D creative (Kang Hyewon\u2019s company) along with Yu Minyoung (prev. HOW ent.), the best pd48 rapper, and it seemed like 8D was creating a dream team for when Hyewon returns. But, suddenly, Yujin said she was giving up her dreams to become an idol, which is honestly so depressing and regrettable, and its bittersweet to now see her updates with dance covers on her YouTube channel. I don\u2019t know the whole story and I don\u2019t want to belittle her, but hopefully this is temporary and she find the passion to debut and succeed in future (like Natty after Sixteen until now).
