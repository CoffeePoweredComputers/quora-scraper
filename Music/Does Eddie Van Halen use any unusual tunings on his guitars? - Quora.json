            "answer_text": "Yes and no. At first approximation, most of the recorded Van Halen output is in standard tuning a half step down. A couple of songs are in Drop D a half step down, including (surprise) \u201cDrop D-ead legs\u201d. Some EVH fan will come along and correct me here, but I\u2019m not aware of any EVH output in tunings other than variants of standard and drop D. That said, EVH did do two other things that are a bit unusual. First, the studio recordings aren\u2019t always in exact concert pitch a half step down. Sometimes he\u2019d go sharp or flat as much as a quarter tone from concert Eb. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe to make the individual tracks sound different, maybe he just tuned purely by ear, and that\u2019s where he \u201cgot\u201d. Another thing, which is probably more important, is that he\u2019d tune his guitar to individual chords to \u201csweeten\u201d them. That\u2019s a trick that can help intonation especially under heavy distortion. Advantage is that you can get chords in a given piece to sound better. . .disadvantage is that if you try to play any OTHER chords in that tuning they\u2019ll sound worse!. Typical trick here is to slightly flatten the B string to make a better sounding open A chord shape. EVH isn\u2019t the only one who does this, BTW. Its an old rock trick and lots of others use it.

            "answer_text": "Not really. Half a step down is pretty standard in heavy rock music, as is dropping the low E/Eb down to D/C#. As Joseph Grossman mentioned, sometimes he wouldn\u2019t tune to 440, but that isn\u2019t terribly unusual in rock music either. The closest he came was probably on the album 5150 where he used a TransTrem to change tunings mid-song. ",
