            "answer_text": "Starting with the common ones... PopPop comes from the word \"Popular\". It is the trend that most of the common folks are following. The aim of the music is to appeal to a general audience, rather than to a particular sub-culture or ideology. Katy Perry was topping on Pop music charts a few months back, when suddenly Gangnam Style came to conquer our playlists. In Pop music, the artistic and technical aspects are given lesser attention than the \"poppy\" feel.  Famous Artists : Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Pink, Chris BrownSub-genres : Disco-Pop, Country-Pop, Space Age Hip-HopHiphop or Rap is the style that involver the rhyming and rhythmic speech style that we call as rapping. If you are of my age, you probably grew up in the golden age of this genre with the guys like Eminem and 50 Cent booming in your earphones all the time. This grew faster with the advent of technology including DJing and scratching, beatboxing and easy-to-use looping softwares. Famous Artists : JayZ, Eminem, Drake, Nicki MinajSub-genres : GFunk, Rap-Rock, Hip-House RockIt grew up with Guitars. Any Rock group would consist of Electric Guitars, Bass and Drums. Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity than pop music. Rock emphasizes on heavy beats and unlike pop, may focus on things other than romance. Most of the famous rock songs are built on philosophical themes.  This genre slowly mixed with other genres to produce new types. Some of them will be discussed soon. Famous Artists : Led Zeppelin, 12 Stones, The Beach Boys, Beatles, Eric ClaptonSub-genres : Alternative, Punk Rock, Progressive, Hard Rock JazzJazz is said to be popularized by Afro-Americans. Jazz uses blue notes, syncopation, swing, call and response, polyrhythms, and improvisation. It includes a wide range of instruments ranging from Piano to Guitars to Wind Instruments. Famous Artists : Frank Sinatra, Nancy WilsonSub-genres : Jazz Blues, Bebop, Swing BluesThe blues is a vocal and instrumental form of music based on the use of the blue notes and a repetitive pattern which is most of the time a twelve-bar structure. It evolved in the United States in the communities of former African slaves, from spirituals, praise songs, field hollers, shouts, and chants. Famous Artists : Jimmy Rogers, David MaxwellSub-genres : Jazz Blues, Country Blues CountryCountry music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjoes, electric, acoustic guitars, harmonicas. Play a country song in a calm evening and you'll feel yourself retired in a cool green countryside, or find yourself driving on the muddy roads. Famous Artists : Lady Antebellum, Brad Paisley, Bob DylanSub-genres : Blues Country, Bluegrass, Country-Rock MetalMetal is a genre of rock music that came up during 1970's. You recognize a music piece is metal when you either start banging your head with every beat or run away from it (yeah there're people who do so). It is characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, thick massive sound and overall loudness. The lyrics may range from plain philosophy to rage against warfare and human ruthlessness and anger. Famous Artists : Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer, MegadethSub-genres : Trash Metal, Black Metal, Death Metal, Gothic Metal ============================================== Just these popular ones took so much space that I won't be discussing them here. Just go out to a music store and explore. You'll love the vast vast world of melodies... ",
