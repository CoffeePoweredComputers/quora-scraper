            "answer_text": "While there is no one song moves all answer to this question, I will try to give you some food for thought. It may help you in picking just the right accompaniment when you pop the question. For that perfect background score, I\u2019d want to pick a song that I\u2019m already familiar with. Not only familiar, it would have to be a song that tingles my heart every time I hear it - a melody that strums the chords of my heart, words that give voice to my deepest emotions. Something that makes the hair on my neck stand and my eyes well up. To add an enthralling personal touch, I\u2019d love it if the song had a story to tell. It was the song that was being played on loop when we were in the car talking about everything and nothing in particular at the same time. The time when the packed Delhi traffic was a blessing and none of us was in a rush to get to our destinations. It was the song of the evening when it became clear to both of us where we were headed. A song that brings back pleasant memories about our relationship or the one that has silly anecdotes associated that are telling of the intense emotions involved. Or even a song that is the very definition of the way we are, the one that was probably written with us in mind. A song that captures the essence of our relationship and its quirks. A song that makes me laugh through my happy tears. A song that is classic and timeless. Think back, think hard and don\u2019t forget that this is as much about you as it is for her. Good luck! ",
