            "answer_text": "No, you should not play the notes you are singing (the melody). The most common formula for a piano/vocal is: melody-sung, chords-in right hand of piano and bass notes- in left hand of piano. (bass notes are simply single notes that are the name of your chord) As you get better you can make parts and patterns from your chords or create a bass line but in the beginning keep it simple. I\u2019ll give you some reasons why and then I\u2019ll also make some suggestions to help you with your pitch issues. If you play the melody, it will be competing with your singing. Because the voice has different strengths than the piano, it would be very hard to really replicate it exactly on the piano anyway.It\u2019s redundant to double the same part in multiple instruments. Occasionally you may do this for effect on a part of a song. You also may layer some sounds together in a recording, but the goal there is for it to sound like one sound (made up of multiple sounds) playing a part. Usually you want parts to support and contrast with each other to fill out an arrangement.Sung melodies often don\u2019t sound great on the piano, particularly melodies that have a lot of repeated notes. Repeated notes can sound great with the voice because the voice has so many nuances in pitch, tone and words. Whenever you transfer a part from one instrument to another, you should always consider how it would be the most authentic on the that instrument. Sometimes a melody can be played exactly the same and it works. Often times not.In a piano/vocal, the piano really should take the role of harmony (chords) and support the vocal by being in the background. There are times when you are not singing, such as between sections, when the piano can take the solo role. You could even play the melody with chords underneath it in an instrumental section. This doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have a piano part that is more interesting or sounds melodic but it shouldn\u2019t compete with the vocal.This may sound confusing because every sheet music you pick up has the melody worked into the piano part. You might notice that most of the time it doesn\u2019t sound great or really remind you of the song. The reason why this is done is because the publisher wants to sell the same sheet music to as many people as possible without having to customize the music for whatever it is being used for. Arrangements really should be customized for whatever their purpose is so they can work well and capture the essence of the song with whatever instrumentation is used. How to help with \u2018pitch issues\u2019: Ideally, you should really take the song you are singing and work it phrase by phrase. Take the original recording of the artist and play a phrase, then sing it back. Work the same phrase over and over until you can replicate it. This really is how most singers learn and learn to imitate singers they like. (you don\u2019t need the piano for this step)You certainly can give yourself some notes on the piano or play the melody for yourself while you\u2019re learning, just don\u2019t do it in your final arrangement.You can choose inversions that put your melody note on top. The note you are singing is almost always in the chord that goes with it. Your ear automatically hears whatever is on top as the melody so this will really help you hit the right note. I usually recommend playing chords in root position when you\u2019re first learning chords so you can learn the notes in the chord well. However, if pitch is a challenge, it might be better to learn the inversions. Just make sure you really drill on the notes in your chords on their own so you are not just memorizing shapes. Feel free to download my free piano chord dictionary to refer to. You can also check out my video playlists understanding scales and chords if you like.I\u2019m planning to do some play and sing tutorials on my site suzanstroud.com. I\u2019d be happy to take requests or answer any questions if you want to reach out to me. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "A few thoughts: Right now, double your vocal melody on the piano to assure your pitch is right, as you\u2019re doing.When you have learned the melody perfectly, sing with only the chords and be sure you are fitting your melody perfectly with the harmony.Get a teacher to help you learn to sight sing and train your ears so you know what you\u2019re doing technically. Maybe an advanced university music major.Work with a pianist/coach occasionally to have some experienced ears to assess your progress.Very few people can become competent musicians completely on their own. Get help and teaching from experienced musicians/teachers. This way you don\u2019t waste your time making lots of unnecessary mistakes. ",
