            "answer_text": "Copyright claim is only there on YouTube and might be there on Facebook too, because one of my video's song was blocked due to copyright. Video got muted but video was still there on Facebook. There is no copyright like thing on instagram. You can even use songs of T-Series instagram. Uploaders don't upload full song on Instagram. So there is no point of profit. Profit is only done on instagram when you are uploading something for a brand. And the brand is paying you. Thank you Just want to tell everyone.. if anyone of you who is reading this answer, needs any kind of help, I had mentioned all ways of contacting me in my Quora description.!

            "answer_text": "You cannot use someone else's content without permission. Doing so is illegal copyright infringement. It doesn't matter if you make a profit. Obviously so when you realize internet piracy is distributing stuff for free. Why are they not getting caught or punished? Because Instagram doesn't scan uploads like YouTube dies and it is harder to search for content on IG. You can really seek out videos with Drake or Beyonce music. So the record companies have a harder time shutting down misuse. ",
