            "answer_text": "How to Make Money on TikTok TikTok is one of the most common ways of creating and sharing short social media videos. With no ways of exchanging text messages, pictures or anything else that you can get with other sites, TikTok relies entirely on the ability of users to make entertaining videos for fans. Many of the most famous TikToks users have found ways to pay for their content. Here are a few different ways to make TikTok money.  Use TikTok as a Promotional Outlet If you're an influencer or already famous on other social media, you can use TikTok to reach an audience you probably don't touch yet. TikTok has a much younger audience with which you might not yet communicate. It's a great way to create more content in today's most popular video types. To boost your ad revenues, you can use your new-found audience to direct traffic to your YouTube channel or something like that. Most TikTokers will also upload videos to Instagram to reach an audience that may not yet be on the TikTok site. Just check #TikTok on Instagram to see how other developers profit from it. Get Sponsors You can get sponsorships once you have obtained a decent size after TikTok. Make sure that you have a business email on your twitter account for potential sponsors to contact you. You can also work with a consultant to link you to more sponsors. You are paid by the advertisers to promote their products on your social media platforms. This is an income source for most of the biggest influencers. Sell Merch You might want to think about selling merchandise in shirts, hoodies, etc. If you have a large audience. This is another common revenue source for many of TikTok's leading stars. There are many different merchant companies with which you can create apparel for your fans. Ad Revenue TikTok does not actually have an ad revenue program. If you have used YouTube and Twitch, you probably know how to earn a portion of your channel's ad revenue. TikTok has no advertisements yet on its website, but they will be adding it soon. It ensures that TikTokers can gain money from ads on their channels. ",

            "answer_text": "TikTok itself does not pay to creators at this point, that\u2019s not to say it won\u2019t change. At the moment, it does not have a partner program, like YouTube, that pays ad revenue to content creators. That\u2019s likely because splash ads and homepage ads on TikTok are not as common now for brands than other platforms. However, given the growth rate in the past year, brands and marketers are starting to look at advertising to younger generation on the platform. This behaviour change may alter the company\u2019s payment model, who knows? Currently, a typical TikTok creator earns money through coins/emoji packs your audience gives you (when you go live), selling own merchandise, and brand partnerships. TikTok takes a commission out of the coins creators receive from their audience. ",
