            "answer_text": "SICKICKHe is a Pakistani. His original name is Lomus Rai. He started his career as a lead singer in the group called CULTURE SHOCK. He came into limelight with his stage name LOMATICC. Being a singer in that group gave him recognition and lots of fans loved his voice. But that was not too long until his stardom vanished and not many songs were released and finally everything came to an end. Here you can see his old images as a singer in Culture Shock  But after a few years, he came back into producing music and remixing original tracks with a completely different name now popularly known as SICKICK. He likes to cover his face with a mask and doesn\u2019t like to reveal his real identity. Only his true fans like me were able to recognize him and turns out that hiding his face actually worked out as most of the fans were women and they were really in love with his jawline and Smile *wink*.  He is a musical genius and whoever listened to him are always impressed by his knowledge of music and he really knows how to make music out of anything. Due to his amazing talent, his videos were shared by popular artists all over the world and pages like 9gag shared his work on their official Instagram post. Here is a link to how he can create music with just a little feature in an app like Snapchat  I have been a fan of him from the past few years and had been following him since he had just 40k subscribers. I had made a sketch for him a few months back and he actually took time to appreciate my effort by liking it and commenting on it. Manas on Instagram: \u201cSpread sickness. #sickick \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f #sickickmusic #sickickfanart #sickickhalloween2018. Oh fish he commented on this pic. #drawingindian\u201d Due to some reason, not all people would like his music and he doesn\u2019t get enough recognition. ",

            "answer_text": "Lowell George. Never heard of him? Not surprising really, he died at an early age just when he was starting to get some real traction as a solo artist. As the nominal leader of Little Feat he was a critic\u2019s darling, as was the band, but the group never broke big. He was an amazing songwriter. Here\u2019s a cover version of one of his tunes, Easy To Slip, performed by Bob Weir of Grateful Dead fame.  Linda Ronstadt covered several of his tunes. Here she performs Willin\u2019, as close as ol\u2019 Lowell ever got to a hit.  In addition to his song writing talent Mr. George was an excellent singer and others, including Ronstadt and Rickie Lee Jones, sought out his advice on phrasing. Here he takes one of his songs with a tricky time signature and just sings the hell out of it. This is Cheek To Cheek, from his solo album \u201cThanks I\u2019ll Eat It Here\u201d-  So yeah, he could really sing, but he was also clever in arranging vocals. Check out the way the vocals in the following tune, Rock & Roll Doctor, build to a very nice crescendo-  As can be seen in the video, Lowell was a great guitarist with a signature slide touch that\u2019s instantly recognizable to his fans. Below he really tears it up on TripeFace Boogie (Edit), the solo kicks off around 30 seconds in-  In addition to singing, playing guitar and writing songs Lowell acted as producer on Little Feat\u2019s albums. He was a bit of a perfectionist, which could cause tension, but it also yielded some amazing results. Just listen to how incredibly tight the band is on this track, Skin It Back from \u201cFeats Don\u2019t Fail Me Now\u201d recorded in 1974.  As talented as he was, Lowell George partied too hard. It all caught up with him in 1979 and he died of a heart attack while on tour. This last tune speaks to the tragedy of a life lost way too soon.  ",
