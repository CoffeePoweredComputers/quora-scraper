            "answer_text": "Hakka doesn\u2019t sound like Cantonese, but there are lots of loanwords from Cantonese. Although Hakka are outsiders, they never discriminate against Cantonese and most overseas Hakka consider themselves as Cantonese too. Hakka language has more core similarities with Jiangxi Gan language/dialect instead. The grammar, vocabulary and word form is exactly the same as Gan. Hakka people originally come from Jiangxi, they move to Southern Jiangxi due to Mongol invasion. Subsequently, they intermix with She ethnic, a Hmong-Mien ethnic group and Kam-Sui (native Tai-Kadai inhabitants of Jiangxi) to form a new Hakka ethnic. Therefore, Jiangxi is the birth mother of Hakka while Guangdong (Canton) is the adopted mother, both of them share relationship to some extent. what is Gan? Gan is a Central Chinese \u201cdialect\u201d or language that\u2019s considered part of Southern Chinese dialect. Like other Southern Chinese, Central Chinese are genetically mix of Han and minority ethnic groups and many of them are non-Han that adopt Han Chinese culture. Many Central Chinese look different from Northern Chinese. Hakka people look like Central Chinese, they share similar facial features and culture.

My Indian friend Kunendran speaks Hakka very well and he is incidentally married to the daughter of a Hakka contractor. He always insists that spoken and delivered Hakka doesn't sound like Cantonese. \u201cI know because my younger brother Seelan is presently dating a Cantonese lass\u201d, smiles Kunendran. ",

To give you an example: I was told by a Taiwanese friend of mine some years ago that when I came to Taipei, I would feel right at home because the MRT (the metro system in Taipei) did its announcements in Cantonese as well as Taiwanese, Mandarin, and English. But when I arrived, I heard the voiceover he was referring to and it was gibberish to me. I soon learnt it was actually Hakka. As someone who didn't speak either Cantonese or Hakka, he had heard one and assumed it was the other. I could definitely hear the similarity at the time. However, the two languages are not mutually intelligible. ",

            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t speak the dialects, yes, Hakka sounds like Cantonese, because it retains the entering tones. Down in \u7f8e\u6fc3 Meinung, deep Hakka territory in southern Taiwan, when you hear some of the locals speaking Mandarin, their accent sounds like they just got off the plane from Hong Kong. Friends from there have told me that Cantonese is very easy for them to learn, because it is so similar. Of course, if you know the dialects, you can tell the difference apart easily, but for someone who speaks other dialects of Chinese, they sound similar. If you don\u2019t speak Chinese at all, I\u2019d imagine they would sound even more similar. ",

Speaking these two tonal dialects would be like singing two different tunes altogether. ",
