            "answer_text": "No. Grunge didn\u2019t destroy glam metal. Think about for a minute. Suppose it\u2019s the early 1990s and you\u2019re a young person who enjoys going out to rock clubs to have a good time. Are you going to want to listen to depressing music made by guys who hate life so much they kill themselves? Or are you going to listen to the music created by guys who love life, make music that has a positive energy to it, and sing about enjoying life? If you liked Dokken and then one day, right after playing \u201cWhen Heaven Comes Down\u201d the radio station you listen to plays \u201cEvenflow\u201d, why would that make you like Dokken any less? Grunge and metal are entirely different things; it\u2019s not as if Mike McCready is outplaying George Lynch is it? Warren DeMartini played circles around Kurt Cobain. By Lynch\u2019s or DeMartini\u2019s standards, Cobain was a novice level guitarist. Nirvana didn\u2019t become successful by outdoing those guys; they became successful by offering something entirely different. The two are not interchangeable. Grunge doesn\u2019t give you what metal gives you and vice-versa; they both offer something of their own. If you like both, then listen to both! When has there even been a rule that if you find a new kind of music you like, you have to stop listening to everything else you like to listen to? In the 80s and early 90s, rock nightclubs were doing tremendous business with metal bands. You sometimes had to wait 15 minutes in line at the bar just to get a beer! Remember that? That had ended by 1993. The grunge bands did not bring in as many people to the clubs as grunge bands did. People go out to clubs to have fun and the grunge shows just weren\u2019t as fun. That happened because grunge had such a negative attitude. Of the big four grunge bands, Pearl Jam is the only one that has a lead vocalist who is still alive! Cobain shot himself. Layne Staley overdosed on heroin. Chris Cornell hung himself.The only thing grunge musicians ever \u201cdestroyed\u201d was themselves and the rock nightclub business. ",

            "answer_text": "Bulletboys were a good band but kind of a one-trick pony. Dokken was already broken up before grunge came into the charts. Warrant was riding high on one very big song and yeah, their future output was maligned (which is a shame because Dog Eat Dog is actually a great and much-underrated album). Nelson had one song that got serious radio play. All of these bands with the exception of Dokken were at the tail end of the hairband era, at a time where the scene had become tremendously derivative. Everyone was sounding the same and the quality of bands being signed was getting less interesting or compelling. Once the Seattle bands made some headway and the tide had turned, the labels followed suit and these bands (and scores of others) were set adrift. Grunge didn\u2019t destroy their careers, the fickle nature of the pop market did. let's be clear here, all that we are talking about was the pop market for hard rock and metal. The fans of that music, to begin with, didn\u2019t desert them. They did, however, need to operate with less of a marketing presence. Some bands adapted well to this, others didn\u2019t. ",
