            "answer_text": "Torbjorn Arntsen is correct; putting steel strings on a ukulele and tuning it up, would likely shatter the instrument. Before it snapped, it might warp the neck or separate the bridge right off the body. Then the top and the bracing would snap like crackers. Cheaper ukuleles sometimes use fretboard wood that is softer than on guitars, and any wound steel strings would chew that up. All strings on a ukulele should be of the same general material, so that the tension on all the strings is similar, and the neck, the bridge and head don\u2019t have sideways pull on them to warp the instrument. A small body steel string acoustic guitar with a shortened scale (shorter than the standard 25.5 inches, will have an easier playability, similar to how a ukulele plays, but once you are using a guitar body and guitar length steel strings, you are naturally going to get higher string tension. I suggest you look into the cross-over guitars, where an acoustic guitar has been designed to use nylon strings, but the design specs of the neck and the scale length are for nylon. The body and bridge are also designed for nylon strings; they will play easier on the fingers than a steel string guitar, yet still have lots of volume. Shop around. I have played them in stores but don\u2019t own one. Here\u2019s an example:  ",

            "answer_text": "As has been said, do not change nylon for steel strings on the same instrument. At best, you will be unhappy, at worst (and very likely) you will destroy the instrument. Choice of strings is a design choice very early in the process, and very many of the things about the instrument are dictated by that choice. You can't just change strings after the design is set. But with that caution out of the way\u2026 There are a small number of instruments made for steel strings. A tenor guitar is one, very slightly larger than a baritone ukulele, 4 steel strings. Those strings normally have their own tuning, but they can certainly be tuned like a baritone uke. And there are also some ukuleles made as a pure electric solid body with steel strings.  In this video, it is made by a German company called RISA. They make several odd uses, patterned after a Strat, a Telecaster, or here, a Les Paul. there are a very few other manufacturers doing similar things, but of a lesser quality. I have one of those. All of these play like an electric guitar, they sound like an electric guitar if you put a capo on the fifth fret, and are a hoot to play. ",
