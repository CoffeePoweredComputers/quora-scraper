            "answer_text": "The best decade for rock and roll was from 1964 to 1974. I don't mean that that's when my favorite artists did their work. I mean that that is when the climate and state of the art were best suited to creative rock and roll music. I'm looking at the genre in a time frame, not at particular artists. Over these ten years, I think that rock and roll changed and matured more than any other ten year stretch. With all music, but particularly with pop music, there is the innovative and there is the derivative. Rock and roll music is electrified music. I think that the changes in studio recording techniques and the technology of amplified music also experienced an evolutionary burst between 1964 and 1974. This is the era where we saw artists who had honed their skills with limited technology and fewer refined examples to emulate. They were creating their art while studios and concert venues evolved radically around them. They were ideally suited to use the new tools that hadn't been available to those before them. They were musical startups, and as such they were open to new ideas that established 60s bands hadn't yet explored. Bands from around 1964 to 1974 grew up with an an awareness of the political, social and technological turbulence that was 60s. Landmark albums from this era include most of the work of the Beatles, a good chunk of the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, CSN&Y, The Grateful Dead, The Who, The Kinks, numerous psychedelic and folk acts beyond Bob Dylan. Great guitar bands too like Steve Miller and Rick Derringer were starting flourish here. This era saw a swell in social and political activism, increasing scrutiny of government and authority, consumer and environmental awareness, medical and technological breakthroughs and more. That's a lot of fuel for artists, without even mentioning all the new drugs. By the mid seventies though cynicism was ramping up, thanks to the failed and costly efforts in Vietnam, inflation, the near-impeachment and resignation of Nixon, unresolved race relations problems, growing apathy about Space Program, concerns of overpopulation, the ongoing Cold War and more. Overlapping this transition was the beginning of progressive rock with acts like King Crimson, Procul Harum, and the beginnings of Rush. Some of the fractured reaction to these issues was an appetite for a softer more innocent culture. That's when we saw the emergence of artists like Abba, The Carpenters, Bread, John Denver, Barry Manilow, and countless one (or few) hit wonders like Starbuck, Pilot, England Dan & John Ford Coley and Debbie Boone. All of these paved a castrated path to the fluffy disco era. At the same time, residual anger (picked up on earlier in the disenfranchised sounds of Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and Bowie) gave birth to punk and the New Wave, and even the beginnings of rap/ hip-hop. Not to mention the ambient escapist sounds from Brian Eno and Jean Michel Jarre. I did say the reaction was fractured. I'm not saying that there hasn't been great music in all eras, including today. But the music has become too factioned to allow a rush of talent like we saw through the British Invasion and early 70s. We're too grown up or too dissociated now for that kind of music to rule. Kids who play rock and roll or neobeatnik sound today are to some degree emulating a sound rather than responding to the current world around them. I think that even applies (as great as they are) to artists such as Jack White and Lenny Kravitz. They are anachronisms. Here\u2019s an example  The Vogues in 1965  The Lumineers in 2012 ",

Ooh, that\u2019s tough question because rock had three tremendous decades and the 90s had some very good music too, just mixed in with alternative which when I asked my best friend what it was an alternative to, he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s an alternative to music with a high level of musicianship.\u201d The two best decades for rock music were the 70s and 80s and both were amazing! I like the way the level of musicianship kept increasing in the 80s and bands were playing music that bands of previous decades wouldn\u2019t have been able to play. The 70s raised the bar for proficiency on one\u2019s instrument and then the 80s raised the bar yet again. That shows drive and ambition as well as work ethic, all of which are highly admirable qualities. The downfall of the 80s was MTV, despite MTV being a blessing for many bands and solo artists. It saved some those bands five or six years of heavy touring to get the exposure that MTV gave them almost instantly. That\u2019s great, but the criteria for being aired on heavy rotation on MTV was not great because it focused far too much on the physical appearance of the musicians. If a band was great but didn\u2019t necessarily have good-looking people in it, MTV made it extremely difficult for them. So to some degree, style was pushed instead of substance. That\u2019s why ultimately I\u2019ve gotta say the 1970s was the best decade for rock music. The bands who rose to the top in the 70s did it based in merit - on making high quality music. Since the appearances of the band members wasn\u2019t nearly as big a factor then as it became later, the music of the 70s has a very organic, sincere, from the heart sound which I appreciate immensely. Some of my favorite 70s bands: Fleetwood Mac with Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks - those two additions to the band took FM from a band that would sell maybe 100,000 copies of an album, to selling 5 million copies of their first album with Buckingham and Nicks. Their next album, Rumours, shattered records, selling 40 million copies and establishing Fleetwood Mac as genuine superstars. Stevie Nicks became a solo star in her own right and established her place among the best of the best singers in rock! Led Zeppelin - They exploded in the 70s, becoming the biggest band of the decade and they had the talent to back it up. Led Zeppelin was made up of four inordinately talented musicians and they could and did play all styles of music on their albums. In 1974 they released Led Zeppelin IV with what is the most famous rock song of all time - Stairway To Heaven. Lynyrd Skynyrd established southern rock as a major force and established themselves as the premier southern rock band. Their anthem Sweet Home Alabama is one of the best recognized rock songs ever, and their masterpiece - Freebird - is their Stairway To Heaven. It has an epic guitar solo that even today very few guitarists even attempt to play. Heart was a band fronted by Ann and Nancy Wilson and proved that the women could rock just as good as the men. Their first two albums especially - Dreamboat Annie and Little Queen are masterpieces. Pink Floyd - what an amazing guitarist David Gilmour is! My favorite song by them is Dogs, from my favorite Pink Floyd album Animals. Their double album The Wall is of legendary status now as is Dark Side Of The Moon. The 1970s also gave birth to heavy metal - a form of rock music which has a foundation built more on heavy, powerful sounding guitar riffs than vocals, although the vocals are still incredibly important. The difference is that in heavy metal the voice is treated as just one of the instruments in the band instead of dominating the band like they usually do. Black Sabbath - the godfathers of heavy metal Judas Priest - they took the heavy blues based sound of Sabbath and metalized it with the twin guitar leads of Glen Tipton and KK Downing and the absolutely virtuosic vocal abilities of \u201cThe Metal God\u201d Rob Halford.
