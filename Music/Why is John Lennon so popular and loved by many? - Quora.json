            "answer_text": "Wow Todd \u2026 while I agree with some of the items you mentioned a few are not things to be admired. I especially take exception to 11 and 14. He not only was cruel to Cynthia and Julian he even hit Yoko and was cruel to her. What you are saying is that he could be a monster but all in all he had a good heart. The truth is he was a violent person by nature at times especially if he had been drinking or was high. Ultimately he really wasn\u2019t even true to himself. More often than not he did what Yoko wanted and not what he wanted. My intent is not to bash John because we all have flaws and demons and he probably had more than most so in that sense he was human just like the rest of us. John was a masterful songwriter and had one of the best rock voices in the history of music that is for certain. Even though John would often lie (this is pretty well documented) but he had such an incredible manner to him we could overlook some of his fault. John was truly witty as were all 4 Beatles. John was incredibly charming as well. Because John could be so likable we tend to overlook the many negative things about him. I think the fact that he came from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest figures in modern music certainly makes us like him. He was one of us in affect. John was always worried about his image so many parts of his life were kept private. I have to say the single thing that contributes to him being so popular and loved is the way he died. Prior to his death he hadn\u2019t really been in the public eye for 5 years and he had just released Double Fantasy shortly before his death. By all accounts the album was getting only mediocre reviews but that changed after his death. Like so many other performers dying elevated him to a whole other level of celebrity. This happens so often like was the case with Morrison, Hendrix and Janis Joplin.They went from good-great artists to legends immediately. I personally love Lennon but I also recognize that he was a troubled person with a lot of insecurities. These all made him seem to be on the same level as we average people and someone we could more easily relate to instead of being a diva and snobby person who thought he was better than us. ",
