            "answer_text": "These answers are ridiculous. Hint: if you have to name the song or the artist after the lyric, then you are conceding that it won't be recognized. If the \"most recognized lyric\" is not instantly recognizable, then it is not the most recognized lyric. Yesterday, my friend from way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans just called to say she loved me, and you know that can't be bad. Chances are, if reading a lyric makes a song pop into the head of half the people reading this, it is pretty recognizable. Even though I just implanted 5 earworms, none of those familiar lyrics are as well recognized as \"Happy Birthday to you\" or \"We wish you a Merry Christmas\". ",
