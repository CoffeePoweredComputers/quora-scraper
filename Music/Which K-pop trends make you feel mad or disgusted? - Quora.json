            "answer_text": "The bandwagon hateSelf explanatory I think, especially to groups like BTS and Blackpink who I dare say are the most hated groups for no reason at all, it\u2019s a trend these day to hate on them even if you never listened to their music or watched their interviews as long as everyone hate on them then logic says jump in the train, and that\u2019s literally the lowest anyone could get, you can dislike any group no one is forcing you to like them but hating on them is low, and hating on them for no reason whatsoever is lower, the range of kpop stans these days in on the fvcking floor. 2. The shipping \u201cOmg X idol looked at Y idol they\u2019re dating\u201c if that\u2019s your logic then I damn well dated everybody I\u2019ve seen in my life. I find it ironic how idols like Momo and Heechul weren\u2019t shipped much even though they had many interactions but idols like Lisa (Blackpink) and Jungkook (BTS) who literally have no onstage interaction either than bowing politely are the most popular kpop ship. Listen up delusional stans, these idols are probably dating someone right now, I wouldn\u2019t know since I don\u2019t know them personally but that doesn\u2019t mean you ship them with every single idol out there, Jungkook of BTS is literally shipped with everyone that has legs and breathe simply because he bowed or looked at them for a second but go off felecia ship him with the entire industry and then wonder why he and BTS are literally ghosts in award shows. 3. Visuals >>>> Talent If you\u2019re a beautiful idol visual or not then you\u2019re popular it\u2019s an unwritten rule in the industry, idols like Cha Eunwoo of Astro and Suzy former MissA are the most popular members and even more popular than their groups because they\u2019re visuals, what made them better than their groups is nothing more than visuals. In the kpop industry visuals outweigh talent. 4. Assuming idols sexuality To me personally this is one of the most disturbing topics among kpop fans, this applies to all idols regardless males or females. I\u2019m not gonna describe how some fans say \u201cOh x Member held Y member hand they\u2019re married\u201d or the \u201cOMG X male idol smiled in Y female idol direction they\u2019re dating\u201d no that\u2019s not a my problem, my problem is that some fans tend to push that idols in a particular group are dating down everyone\u2019s throat and when you argue with them they\u2019ll curse you with every word in the book and not just towards us fans but also in the idols Vlive or concerts which I find completely disturbing. In Korea the skin ship between the same gender is normal get that straight through your brain, and idols do it because it\u2019s a normal thing in their country, and you going around assuming their sexuality is wrong and insanely disrespectful, you ruin their friendships by your actions more than you can ever imagine. And when idols say they don\u2019t like being shipped with people in the industry *cough* BTS *cough* that doesn\u2019t give you the liberty you to ship them with each other to the moon. The double standards No comment honestly. The American success It\u2019s another unwritten rule, You aren\u2019t good if you aren\u2019t popular and successful in America, companies push their idols especially rookies towards the American market disregarding their domestic popularity, and we all know damn well that popularity in America is really temporarily while in Korea you may last longer than you think. I just don\u2019t understand why send 1 year rookies with no experience at all to America *looking at you JYP, and every other company* and why create a whole mf group just to get money from the west when you have other mega successful groups under your belt *looking at you SM* The kpop industry first and foremost is business but the whole American success and validation is just stupidity at its finest level.

            "answer_text": "Well not all of these anger me, but here are some I\u2019m getting sick of: Shipping. I get that it\u2019s fun to pair up members that are adorable together, and coo over them hugging and staring into each other\u2019s eyes. But sometimes fans ship them too hard, and instead of focusing on their accomplishments and projects members are working on, all they talk about is how much they ship members. Spamming the comments with #[shipname]. It just gets irritating after seeing these hundreds of times, and it can make idols feel a bit uncomfortable if they simply see members as a friend (imagine being in a relationship with someone you see as just a friend). Yes, feel free to ship idols all you wish, but remember to continue showing them more support. Talk to other stans that hardcore ship the members you ship instead of spamming posts with ship names. Not to mention fans hating each other because of ship wars\u2026Fan Wars. Honestly why can\u2019t everyone accept each other. Everyone is different! Maybe a friend hardcore stans The Rose (excellent group btw plz check them out!) but doesn\u2019t enjoy GOT7 (don\u2019t worry I\u2019m a stan). You, on the other hand, might be a huge GOT7 stan but don\u2019t like The Rose. Who cares? You don\u2019t need to argue about why your ult groups are the best, and why you don\u2019t like their ult groups. How would you feel if a stan of a group you don\u2019t enjoy wanted to force you to forget the groups you love and stan groups you don\u2019t enjoy? Stop wasting time with people who put you down, and use more time to show your support for groups you love. If you don\u2019t like a group, stay away from them. No one is forcing you to love groups you don\u2019t love, and staying somewhere you don\u2019t like will make you upset and waste your time. Leave those you hate alone, and pour out your heart to those you love.Aegyo. It\u2019s nice to see artists acting in such cute ways, but sometimes you can see idols are being forced to act cute. I think there\u2019s much more pressure on female idols to act cute at all times, even when they aren\u2019t in the mood. I don\u2019t enjoy seeing people with a fake personality/attitude, and I just want to see the true life of idols. But idols are human. They go through hard times, hide things from fans, get injured, get into arguments, cry - because this is normal and happens to everyone. Sometimes companies want to give the best, perfect image of their idols, and hide the moments of weakness. I guess what I\u2019m saying is I\u2019m sick of seeing companies force idols to use aegyo instead of showing their true emotions. Also sometimes aegyo is overused, and some \u2018baby voices\u2019 can get irritating.But I\u2019ll forever love kpop with my entire heart, faults and all. Nothing is perfect <3 ",

            "answer_text": "The whole streaming culture The fact is, that the quality of the music is not based on views or likes. That\u2019s why I am always so mad when people say - \u201cThis group is not as good as this, because they don\u2019t have so many views.\u201d. This is literally so dumb reason to judge the work of artists and it only shows how blinded are you by the love for your favorite group, that the only thing you care about is streaming the song, just to get them more views.  I mean like, of course, I am listening to some songs on repeat, but I don\u2019t do it, just to give the group views, I do it because I like the song. It is said that some fans don\u2019t even care about the music side anymore and force other fans in the fandom to stream, or else their group won\u2019t win anything.  I believe it is a wonderful experience for the group to win something while promoting their music, but just the idea of the winners - \u201cThose, who have the most fans, which are dedicated to waste their time, stream, vote every day for hours and buy albums can win.\u201d I know that everyone has different taste in music, so no one will be ever satisfied with the winners of the awards, but I feel like the wins should belong to a group, which deserve the wins thanks to the quality of their songs, not thanks to the fans, who are biased in this. It is always said to watch when a group, which comes with amazing music content, loses to the more popular group, which has more fans and more influence. The double-standards Some of you are saying that you hate double standards, but still go and think about a female idol that she is too fat, but at the same time, if the male idol gain weight to be healthy, just like the female one did, you support him, congratulate him and defend him from the very few people, who says something bad about his weight.  You go and say that the woman is a bitch, just because she is not smiling for a while, shows an honest reaction, wear revealing clothes, go to the pub with her friends, get a tattoo or start to date. Do you do this to the male idols in such a way as you do to the female ones?  When the male idol doesn\u2019t smile, the fans are like - \u201cHe is cool and savage.\u201d, when he shows an honest reaction - \u201cHe just showed his opinion, it is okay.\u201d, wear revealing clothes \u201cWow, he is hot and has abs.\u201d, go to the pub - \u201cHe is just having fun with his friends.\u201d, get a tattoo - \u201cHe likes them, it looks good on him.\u201d and start to date - \u201cThe girl she dates must be a golddigger, she sure loves him just for fame, but I don\u2019t mind him dating, because I just want him to be happy.\u201d Let\u2019s be honest here, every time idols start to date each other, the girl always gets more hate. When the idol doesn\u2019t feel well and doesn\u2019t perform on one hundred percent, you are worried about the male idol, while you say that the female one is lazy and is not thankful for getting the chance to debut.  Open your eyes, respect both genders equally. Those crazy fans in the airport I honestly feel disgusted and sorry every time I watch one of these videos of idols arriving at the airport. So far the only idols, who are respected, gets special ways out, and are fully protected from the fans are BTS. Why is it not like that with every group? Whenever I see how tired and annoyed the idols are and still, there are fans shoving into them, putting the cameras to their faces, scream at them, throw the gift they made or buy for them at them and don\u2019t even respect the privacy and space of other normal people, which arrived with the same plane, makes me question if these people have brains or not.  Karen, you can stand two meters away, respecting their space, and still be able to get photos, don\u2019t make yourself look stupid and maybe even hand them the gift. I feel like if people started to do this regularly with every group, soloist, actor, or any other publicly-known person, the celebrities would be much nicer to them - talk to them, let them take nice photos, accept the gift, etc.  Assuming the sexuality of idols It is extremely disrespectful to say about someone - \u201cLook, he/she is totally gay.\u201d. Never ever try to assume the sexuality of people (not only idols) by the way they dress, what make-up they wear, how they style their hair, what friends they have, what songs they listen to, what quotes they post and how they interact with the people of the same gender.  I know that you all love the way how idols present the skinship to you and I must say that I love how they show their friendship, showing us how they know each other and how they comfort each other in hard times, but you making sexual jokes, guessing who is \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d, making something nonexistent out of the friendship moments and many more is just RUDE.  Don\u2019t ever assume people\u2019s sexuality unless they seriously put out a statement saying they are homosexuals. Some of you are being supportive of the idols doing the fan service and you don\u2019t have any problem with that, but then when there is a real gay artist, you feel disgusted (a.k.a Holland, who talked about this topic, when people are disgusted by his sexuality, but push idols into doing homosexual interactions) Fetishizing the minors Firstly, these children shouldn\u2019t even debut in the first place, but they did and now it is our job to treat them like children and not adults. You can\u2019t treat children like adults. You can\u2019t tell them to do sexual stuff, you can\u2019t force them to act sexy, to wear revealing clothes, you can\u2019t bash them for not being mature all the time and you can\u2019t openly assume that they are gay as I stated in the last point.  They are in the age of most of you, so just imagine how would you feel if someone was forcing you to act sexy and wear revealing clothes.  Let those idols enjoy their childhood, just as you did/does. Stop telling idols what they should do Let\u2019s keep up with recent news - don\u2019t force every idol to say something about the Black lives matter -, not all celebrities need to react to it and you can\u2019t be mad at your faves if they don\u2019t want to talk about this. You can\u2019t force idols to donate the money to every place where a disaster happened, you can\u2019t blame idols for posting something (for example when all idols who were somehow working in the Chinese entertainment industry like Jackson, Lay and many more were forced by the government to post on their social media a Chinese flag saying that they support the way China is handling the protests in Hong Kong) = you never see what is going on behind the scenes and not all idols have the freedom to post anything they want on their social media.  Stop saying to idols to act cute, when they don\u2019t want to or feel uncomfortable. All these cringe Aegyos of idols, who obviously are not fans of it, makes me feel uncomfortable. Stop telling idols to not go to the clubs, smoke, or drink alcohol - they are adults if they do this and therefore they can do whatever they want, even though it can damage their health.  Stop saying to the foreign idols to speak English - some of them were born or lived in the English speaking countries, but moved to Korea in the early age and feel more Korean, yet still, people want them to talk about the city they lived in, to talk in English and things like that when some of them don\u2019t even feel the connection to the English speaking country anymore. For example, Vernon from Seventeen was born in New York or Chungha lived in Texas, but both of them don\u2019t feel the need to act like they are American/lived in the US for that long.  Every time idol change their appearance, it is their choice, respect it. Stop trusting the ideal types No one will ever meet the person of their dreams, you can dream about meeting a person of certain looks and personality, but it will never come true. Therefore you can\u2019t trust every word the idol tell you about his/her ideal type. Yes, he is telling you if he/she is overall liking cute or mature image of people, but all of these: \u201cI want a girl who will be 160 cm tall and 45 kg, who will have short dark hair, wear summer dresses and skirts\u2026\u201d For God\u2019s sake, just look at what it can do, when idols say that he/she is interested in dating a foreigner. I don\u2019t want to ruin your fantasies, but these idols are sometimes even taught what to say when they are asked these questions. Some of them actually can have preferences, which the company doesn\u2019t find acceptable to be said in public and that\u2019s why they told them what to say instead.  People not taking groups seriously, when they are doing a cute concept Some people look down at the artists who do the cute concept. They see them as childish, crying, and repetitive, but none of them mind the repetitiveness of the girl crush concept. I am not the biggest fan of the cute concepts either, but from time to time I need to listen to some cheerful songs instead of the badass and mysterious ones.  I think this is the problem of international fans, who are used to the sound of darker music, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can act rude or disrespectful towards groups who do these concepts. It is not just a concept for the groups with young members, it can be done by adults in a unique way and it doesn\u2019t need to be cringy at all.  International fans looking down at Twice, while loving Blackpink is the biggest example of that. Being rude when other groups try to promote in the west Whenever a group go promote to the west and actually gets some recognition, certain fandom always gets mad, because \u201ctheir BTS paved the way for the idols to the west\u201d. Yes, they did pave the way for the k-pop to the western music market, but you can\u2019t be mad when other groups go there and promote not only themselves but k-pop as a genre, just like BTS did. BTS did it with the intentions of spreading the Korean culture to the west and the other groups do the same thing. It is like you would be mad at Rihanna because she also went to the pop industry just like Beyonce did - see, your thinking is ridiculous.  ",
