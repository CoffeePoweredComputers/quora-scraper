            "answer_text": "Disclaimer:This is a very long article, if you don\u2019t like to read long articles then don\u2019t read it.This whole article is based on , other fans\u2019s reasons for hating or disliking Blackpink and also on my knowledge on Blackpink, I will also give my personal opinion in the end of what I think about these reasons. Blackpink was the first K-pop girl group I was introduced. Their songs were very catchy, visuals were cool, voices were very beautiful which is why I usually loved them but then their fans (Blinks) started to criticize one of their members Jennie.  -She was one of the k-pop idols; which many youtube videos said received most hate in twitter. 1st reason was that her outfit was said to be always better than the other 3 members.    Although All of the members are wearing very pretty outfits it\u2019s Jenny\u2019s outfit which is more attracting in the 1st one and in 2nd and 3rd one 3 members are wearing dark colored outfit and Jennie is the only one that is wearing light colored outfit which is considered the center of attention. 2nd reason that Jenny is said to be very lazy on the stage. Here is the video of her:  3rd reason is that people say that she is said to be favored by YG all the time and many fans say that the name of Black pink\u2019s name will change into \u201cJennie and friends\u201d. 4th reason was that Jennie was involved into Dating scandal with EXO\u2019s kai and many Blinks went crazy over it, many posted videos of fans destroying the square up albums since they felt betrayed but anyway they broke up and many fans still found unfair that she wasn\u2019t kicked out of YG because the agency has no dating rule and many people were kicked out because of that and other members followed the rule too of no dating. This is all about Jennie. -Many fans say that they are overrated and overhyped all the time cause Blackpink has been active for only 3 years and they only have 2 mini Albums \u201cSquare 2\u201d with 3 songs and 3 of them have their mvs and \u201cSquare up\u201d with only 4 songs and only 1 song has a mv. They only have 2 separate songs that are not in album and all songs are being produced by Teddy Park and he is known for producing catchy songs so Teddy Park is said to given the credit for Blackpink\u2019s success. -Another reason is that they are said to have less stage presence.This video is after their mv DDu-Du-DDu-Du was released  Now this is when they debuted in American television show 2019. Many fans in this video\u2019s comment section say that they have lost stage presence.  -Also lot of K-pop fans say that Blink is a toxic fandom and many times they say that their favorite groups have been lot of times attacked by Blinks. -Seungri\u2019s scandal has also affected Blackpink because they both are from same agency. So, these are the reasons why Many K-pop fans don\u2019t like Blackpink. PERSONAL OPINION: It is not always that Jennie is favored (Also it took me a lot of time where Jennie\u2019s outfits was center of attention). Look at this:    For lazy Jennie part,I explained t she is favored by YG but another person brought an interesting reason why Jennie is favored. here it is: Question:Why do you think BLACKPINK's Jennie being 'lazy' on stage? Answer by Evelyn Smith: \u201cThere are other ways that he favouritizes Jennie besides from outfits, but you can just search that up because otherwise we'd be here all day. However at the end of the day, YG just wants money. He doesn't actually care about Jennie! Think of YG as a sponge and YG artists as water. YG will keep soaking and soaking up the money until the artists are nothing. Once you stop making money and people start losing intrerest in you, he's gonna hang you out to dry. You won't have any comebacks, no new songs, nothing. Take CL as an example. We all know that YG liked CL the most in 2ne1 and that she was the most popular member. Once 2ne1 disbanded and people started losing interest in CL and the other members as a whole, what did he do? Abandoned them. We haven't had new music from CL for years, and I don't think we will see any soon. All the interest and money has been taken from her. The older an idol is getting, the less they're gonna have interest in them, and CL is now 27; she's nearing her thirties. People like young artists more. And so here is where Jennie comes in. We all know that Blackpink is 2ne1 2.0, so who is the most similar to CL in Blackpink? Yup, you guessed it. Jennie. When Jennie stops being popular / making money, YG's gonna stop caring for her. Trust me, we're getting there. I'm not just making it annoyingly long for no reason. My previous points all add up to this point. YG just wants attention. He doesn't care if it's good attention, he wants attention. Well, why? You may ask. Money. All these people online are talking about Jennie and how she's lazy and how her other members look like her backup dancers etc. People who read that will go \u2018let's look at these videos'. What does that gain? Attention. They may of never heard of Blackpink before, and then they watch this video and then they think \u2018hmm, I actually really like this song.\u2019 So what do they do? Go on YouTube and watch the music video for it and maybe even some more that came up on their recommended and add their songs onto their iTunes or Spotify playlist. And then what do they do? They tell their friends going \u2018oh my god, have you listened to this song called playing with fire? It's so good!\u2019 and then maybe out of interest (or just because they want their friends to be happy with them) they go and they watch the music video, even if they didn't like it they still watched it. YG got money from that view, whether it be 1p or \u00a31,000. So here is my conclusion in four sentences. This is YG telling her to do this. By being lazy, people complain and hence she gets attention and then people will watch their music videos and listen to their songs. From that, YG gets money - that's all he wants. He doesn't care that he's risking someone's reputation to do it, he's just a rat that wants money. I'm not going to lie, I have to applaud his thinking because this is actually a very good marketing strategy. It's just extremely sad that he has to use someone and risk their future when that person could actually be really nice. YG is still a rat though.\u201d Another theory is that I also think that YG is the one who is not letting Blackpink produce new albums.Just look at what he did with artists 2ne1, Lee Hi etc. He hasn\u2019t given comeback to Lee Hi for 3 years and he also didn\u2019t care about other members of 2ne1 while promoting debut for Cl in America. He also had crush on one of the female artists (I don\u2019t remember her group) but to date her he decided to ruin her career by giving her and her group less comeback and that even affected her members\u2019s career too. When YG can\u2019t treat his female artists well how can he treat Blackpink so well? I think Jennie too get frustrated as I think she wants new album but doesn\u2019t get it and is suffering from lot of hate which I feel like makes her depressed and she feels distracted because of that all the time in stage or have lost motivation that she is not a good artist cause I was in a situation like that too when people told me I was weak in some sort of thing I started doing bad day by day in that thing so I feel that for Jennie even though she is not my bias but This is not all excuse as I feel she is not going to do this to disappoint her fans. -Even though I don\u2019t like \u201cno dating rules\u201d I still feel like she would have been punished cause it is unfair for other\u2019s but anyway it is at least going to be some sort of protest against \u201cno dating rules\u201d. This is all my personal opinion so don\u2019t hate on me and Sorry for my very Bad English and thanks for reading! Edit:What above it said made sense because since Jennie is criticized in all websites and since this all hate towards started with her outfits there is like a huge increase in number of subscribers. One day I noticed it was 18M then after about 2 or 3 days it was about 19million and then about 3or 5 days it was about 20m. Such fast increase I never noticed in other k-pop groups too. ",

            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t get enough exposure. They rarely go to any variety of shows or tv shows in general or mingle with other kcelebs on tv shows. The general public does not get to see their personalities. Because they are \u201cso mysterious\u201d to the public eye, people start speculating a lot of things so they can fill in the blanks of who the BP members are, and speculations are mostly always awful.They\u2019re so famous even though they had only 5 comebacks and roughly 13 songs. People despise the fact that BP can be so big even though their discography is so small. Maybe because their favs had wayyy more comebacks and songs than BP and they are not as popular as them or just as popular. Maybe because they believe they don\u2019t deserve the fame since for them, BP didn\u2019t work hard enough for it.The idea of \u201cI hate YG because of their criminal scandals so I hate BP even though they had no criminal records\u201d is very prevalent (it might have died down though). It\u2019s like hating the child of a criminal even though the children had done no criminal acts.There\u2019s the bandwagon effect. Because the more people hate on Blackpink, the more people will join, because you know, why not? the brain will unconsciously think: \u201cIf BP gets hates on so much, then there must be a valid rational explanation, no?\u201d and then further think \u201cWithout any proper research on their singing and rapping skills, dance abilities, stage performance, and personality, I\u2019m going to say they are talentless and worthless girls who are only famous because of X Y and Z since many people say so. Why do I believe that, well\u2026. I am sheep \ud83d\ude0a\u201dHere\u2019s an opinion of mine which might be problematic: a reason can be their beauty. The girls of Blackpink are gorgeous like they can be models (ironically, they have more photoshoots than songs performances, I guess they have to stay relevant somehow \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) so those girls who are hating can have internalized jealous without realizing it and attack the girls. It just engrained through nurture or nature for females to be threatened, jealous, and competitive of females who are conventionally attractive. Luckily most women are not like that Why Pretty Girls May Be Especially Vulnerable to BullyingAnother reason is the Kpop demographic. Many people who are avid fans of Kpop are in their early teens or pre-teens. Many teens like to troll a lot, so they say hurtful things because it\u2019s fun to do so, or they\u2019re bored.Some people are miserable inside, so they hate on others (celebrities mostly) to feel better about themselves/feel better inside. Blackpink is an easy target since many already hate them.The bigger you are, the more hate you get because you reach more and more people.Then there are fights between fandoms. A major example is BP and BTS. Before the girl crush / badass concept became popular and before it saturated the Kpop market, BP was the only popular group sporting that concept. Since girl crush concept is similar to bg concepts and BP had a westernized feel to their songs (makes sense since their producer is American) and they are the most popular gg in the anglophone music market (America, Canada, and the UK) AND BP fans and BTS fans always break youtube records, anglophone media always compared them to BTS or put those two names in their titles when talking about Kpop. As a result, there is or was (or will be\u2014if June's BP comeback breaks their Kill This Love record) competition between each other. Because of rivalry, blinks hate on armies and armies hate on blinks. But because the army fandom is much larger (so they will have much more immature fans \ud83d\ude11), BP would receive tons and tons of hate from armies. (a great example is an armies\u2019 reply to this same question)There might be other reasons, but these are my least bias reasons I can give to this question. ",
