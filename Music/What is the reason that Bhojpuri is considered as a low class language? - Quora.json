            "answer_text": "What is the reason that Bhojpuri is considered as a low class language? It is about perception, isn\u2019t it? Bhojpuri is mainly spoken in Northern Bihar and Eastern UP(in India) and these regions are not economically strong. People from these areas often go out and work as labourer elsewhere. This may have created a perception that Bhojpuri is a low class language. As far as the languages spoken as mother tongue goes, Bhojpuri is above Punjabi and Malayalam.  Also, Lalu Prasad Yadav ruined it :P List of languages by number of native speakers in India - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Bihar has a diverse culture with around 5 different dialects of different regions . Among them only bhojpuri has got so much of recognition unfortunately because of the item songs made in bhojpuri . However in the same language , u can get to hear beautiful collection of folk songs but it's only the item songs that have been publicised with vulgar content . People outside the state know bihari songs to be the ones as item songs only . So this may be the reason why bhojpuri is considered as low class language. ",
