            "answer_text": "Symphonie espagnole is one of my favorite pieces! It\u2019s so much fun to perform (aside from the terrifying shifts in the opening line). In her famous concerto sequence, Dorothy Delay places both Wieniawski concerti directly before Symphonie and Dvorak after. Personally, I think this is an odd placement: Wieniawski and Dvorak are both significantly more difficult than Lalo, both technically and musically. I studied Bruch (all three movements) right before Lalo, and then took a break to play Vitali\u2019s Chaconne, Vivaldi\u2019s Winter, and some lighter classical pieces (on the level of Mozart 4, probably) before going back to the typical Romantic student repertoire. At the level of concerti such as Mendelssohn, Bruch, Lalo, Barber, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, etc., I think difficulty really depends on what an individual\u2019s strengths are and what one enjoys performing. For instance, performing the first movement of Barber definitely doesn\u2019t require the same sort of showoff-y virtuosic playing that the third movement of Mendelssohn does. What it does require is a good bow hold that can manage smooth bow changes and upbow spiccato, even vibrato, and lots of musicality. I know that lots of my violin friends think the first movement of Mendelssohn is a lot harder than the third movement, and I completely disagree with them. So far, this has been a total non-answer. I personally find Bruch and Saint-Sa\u00ebns (B minor) to be the most similar. I also think that the harder Mozart concerti took me about as long, but they\u2019re so different in style that I don\u2019t want to compare them in terms of difficulty. ",
