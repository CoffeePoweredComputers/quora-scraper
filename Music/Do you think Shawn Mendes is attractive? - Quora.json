Personally, I think he is very charming in a boy next door type of way. He looks like that hot neighbour that you had a crush on in 9th grade, lol. His smile is very cute, he has nice body proportions, and from what random bits of interviews I\u2019ve seen with him, he seems to be all-around a lovely person (but don\u2019t take my word for it!), which makes him attractive.
