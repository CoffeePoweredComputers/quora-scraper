            "answer_text": "Ringo knew them from Hamburg and played with them a couple of times when Pete was not available. Ringo was a match musically and personally with the band while Pete was the drummer they could get to go to Hamburg. The other 3 never found anyone to replace Pete and were loyal to him though they knew he had not mature as a musician like they had. When new producer George Martin said Pete was not good enough to be the drummer on their records, they had no choice but to replace him and Ringo was their clear choice. Luckily Ringo was getting ready to leave the band he was with and a few days later he joined the Beatles. The three asked their manager to tell Pete the bad news and it ended badly with Pete eventually suing them and winning for something said in an interview. Manager Epstein tried to place Pete in another band but Pete refused. Epstein tried again by going through someone else and got Pete into a trio as the lead star. Success without the Beatles eluded Pete who left music a few years later. Ringo accurately says he had nothing to do with it. Best was out before he was asked to join. Paul John and George (and Brian) all indicated later that it was a cowardly way to let him go, but they had no experience. They were around 20 yrs old at the time and figured it was the managers job so they told him to manage it. Since the 80\u2019s and retiring from his regular job, Best has toured occasionally as former Beatle Pete Best. In the 90\u2019s Paul insisted early rare recordings with Best be included on the Anthology, so Best wound up earning about 5\u201310 million. ",

            "answer_text": "The main reason was Ringo was a talented drummer where Pete Best was not close to that. If the group was going to make it, Best had to be replaced and the best drummer on the scene was Ringo. This is very well documented. Others say it was because Pete was as handsome as John and Paul. The reality was Best was keeping the band from becoming what we know today. ",
