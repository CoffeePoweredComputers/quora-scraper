            "answer_text": "I\u2019m doing both hairstyles and outfits, because yes there are some hairstyles that were very iconic. But also, some of these were outfits that are currently labeled as cringey in this day and age, based on the question What were the cringiest k-pop outfits? So you may see an overlap. Mostly this answer contains mainly 2nd generation outfits, since the 3rd generation-4th generation isn\u2019t quite over yet (I also can\u2019t remember many outfits in the 3rd generation that are iconic or recognizable, it usually depends on if the song or mv itself are iconic too, at least for me.) But here are some, that I thought were iconic or recognizable: 2ne1\u2019s Dara during their Fire promotions with her iconic hair.  SNSD during their Genie promotions  Kara in Mr. promotions  H.O.T Candy outfits. (Many idols have covered this song with these exact outfits).  G-dragon\u2019s hair in Fantastic Baby is very iconic  Not to mention, Big Bang\u2019s Fantastic Baby outfits were very recognizable, lots dressed up as them for events and such.  Red Velvet\u2019s Dumb Dumb outfits  After School Bang outfits  T-ara\u2019s paws and ears, during Bo Peep Bo Peep promotions  Crayon Pop\u2019s Bar Bar Bar outfits  Outfits I feel that will be iconic in the future, or maybe they are, I\u2019m not sure: Twice\u2019s Heart Shaker outfits  BTS\u2019s Dope outfits  Even though this is a common outfit among western singers, but particularly for kpop fans, I feel that Hwasa\u2019s outfit during MAMA 2018 will be an iconic and recognizable outfit. Since it sparked such controversy.  Lastly, how could we ever forget about you JYP?  ",
