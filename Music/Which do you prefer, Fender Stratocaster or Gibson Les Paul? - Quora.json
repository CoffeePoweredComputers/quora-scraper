            "answer_text": "A2A. Personally, I own, play and like both type of guitars but I tend to prefer a Fender Stratocaster over a Gibson Les Paul - depends to a certain degree on the music, amp and the setting (live, recording a.s.o) though. I would have to add that I don\u2019t just prefer a guitar because it\u2019s a Fender or Gibson style - it has way more to do with the individual guitar - I\u2019ve played lots of both brands that I don\u2019t really like. I also tend to find a lot of the Gibson Les Paul guitars a bit overpriced for what you get. ",
