            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s very easy to learn. You generate the sound by blowing air into the mouthpiece, like in a whistle. You don\u2019t need to do anything with your lips, but control the strength of the breath - but this is very natural. The flute is tuned to minor pentatonic scale, which is very natural for us, and composing melodies with it is very simple. A Native flute is probably the simplest flute to play in the world. I do have an entire website dedicated to teaching this wonderful instrument, read one of the articles: How to Learn to Play Native American Flute ",
