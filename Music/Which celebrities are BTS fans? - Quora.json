Ansel Elgort - Ansel is extremely close with the boys and has been known to text and hang out with them every now and then.

I came across a video recently (uploaded September 7th) and it showed Justin Bieber gushing over \u201cDynamite\u201d and the boys, so I wanted to mention him first since that was so recent.  Justin Bieber has shown his love for BTS in a recent video for \u201cE! News.\u201d He did the entire voiceover and stated: \u201cIf anyone knows how to make history, it\u2019s BTS. The K-Pop group has been shattering records across the global music industry. From ringing in the New Year in Times Square to Carpool Karaoke with James Corden, they performed in Grand Central Station for The Tonight Show and wowed at this year\u2019s virtual VMAs.\u201d ~ E! News  Throughout the video, Justin just basically goes over all the history-setting records made by BTS and how they continue to be more successful everyday. He ends off by enthusiastically saying: The mainstream K-pop invasion is just beginning! As a big Army, it\u2019s great to see artists like Justin come out and encourage K-pop groups. It\u2019s not something that is so easily earned for these groups and they truly deserve it. Justin\u2019s message was so adorable and I just had to include it\u2026. also since I appreciate it and it was so recent anyways. Anyways, here are some other western artists that have been fans of BTS for quite some time now: Halsey Lauv - I love this dynamic \ud83e\udd29Khalid Post Malone - ahhhhh Cardi B - awww Cardi was singing Boy With Luv in that live stream btw Drake - how niceDJ Khaled John Legend - LOL also his children are obsessed with BTS :)Taylor SwiftShawn MendesCharlie PuthCharli XCXCamila Cabello Lil Nas X Ariana Grande - I love this so much!!!!!AND MORE!!!!!!!!!! I\u2019m so proud of BTS\u2026\u2026 my heart\u2019s melting :)\ud83d\udc9c ",
