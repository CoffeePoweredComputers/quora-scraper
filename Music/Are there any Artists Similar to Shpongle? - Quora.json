            "answer_text": "Yes, there are, even though you can\u2019t copy the genius behind Shpongle. As mentioned in the other answer, yes, Ott. Although I don\u2019t agree with his choices of album, Skylon is his strongest album. Either way, he has released 4 albums, Blumenkraft, Skylon, Mir and Fairchildren. The first two were actually released on Twisted Records, just like Shpongle. I\u2019ve got all on CD and both of the available vinyls (Mir and Fairchildren). Less melodic than Shpongle, less variation, but great production and easy to listen to. Another artist is Bluetech. Haven\u2019t heard all by him, I\u2019m missing quite a few CD\u2019s there. I\u2019ve only got two albums, but they are nice. Let us not forget Shulman. More similar to Shpongle than Ott. They have released four albums. I haven\u2019t acquired the first since it\u2019s rare. The three I do have are good, especially the latest ones. Finally, I want to recommend Koan. They make ambient and downtempo, like Shpongle, but very differently. Incredibly melodic and production skills through the roof. And to be honest, they\u2019re even better than Shpongle. Albums to recommend by them are: The Way Of One, Serenity Side A. and Crossing The Rubicon. ",

Make sure to check out Ott remixes - Hallucinogen In Dub, another classic. Most people who know Shpongle should know these very well. There are a plenty more lesser known projects, plus a lot of great albums from Ultimae Records resident artists like Solar Fields, Carbon Based Lifeforms or Aes Dana. Their first several albums are all superb. ",

            "answer_text": "I only discovered Shpongle in 2018 and absolutely adore them. Younger Brother was also excellent, but I struggled with the Hallucinogen sound. Solar Fields is probably my favourite artist at the moment, but Kliment\u2019s \u201cThe Perpetual Ritual\u201d is probably the most similar sounding to Shpongle. Not quite as refined, though. For a different sound, try Koen Holtkampf. Especially \u201cIn The Absence Of Gravity, Please Note The Direction Of The Sun\u201d. A very unusual, perhaps disjointed sound at first, but it coalesces quite nicely at the end. Krusseldorf has a nice sound. Anyone have any love for Hol Baumann? ",

You can try some of the artists listed under these genres at ektoplazm.com.NOt everything there is going to be as good as sphongle obviously since this duo of master musicians is irreplacable! But still we need to make room for new talent! ",
