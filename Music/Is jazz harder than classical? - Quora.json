            "answer_text": "Is jazz harder than classical? Surprisingly enough that is not an easy question to answer because it really totally depends on how you were taught, or not taught, to play music. People who have no training, or experience in music have absolutely no problem answering this question. They see Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach on one side, and a bunch of really rough looking, heroin addicted yet legendary jazz musicians on the other and they call it right away\u2026\u201dclassical, like totally.\u201d To them it is a no brainer\u2026and though the general population tends to have huge misconceptions about music, this is not one of them. That is totally the right answer. So, why is this even an issue? If you asked a room full of classically trained orchestra players, that same question, and they were forced to answer honestly, more than half of them would look at you like a deer in headlights and without hesitation say something to the effect of\u2026\u201dI can\u2019t play jazz. I can\u2019t improvise.\u201d. If you asked a room full of piano performance majors, that question it is likely that ALL of them would begrudgingly admit that the thought of having to improvise causes them severe anxiety, because they can\u2019t do it. Of course, there are those rare exceptions, but overall, this is just the way it is. So why is it that the most highly trained classical players seem to be the ones who find jazz impossible, and the rest of the world knows it is easier to \u201cmake it up\u201d on the fly than it is to memorize and perform Beethoven Sonatas in a formal setting? The answer lies in how classical players, especially pianists are taught to play, and moreso even in what they are taught to believe during their formative years of piano lessons. If you think about it, the whole point of formal training, and the highest pinnacle of achievement one can hope to reach is to have the priveledge of performing the works of long dead legendary composers for audiences. To be known as a \u201cconcert pianist\u201d is truly an honored title, and it is the \u201cdream\u201d of committed young piano students all over the world. It is for that reason that the strongest areas of focus are always on creating great sight readers and performers, and not on encouraging and developing one\u2019s own compositional and creative skills. It is possible, through focusing lessons completely on learning to read music and adding the belief that this skill should take precedence over all other aspects of their training, to create a very gifted pianist who can play anything that is put in front of them, but then becomes totally lost, and is rendered completely silent without the sheet music there to dictate to them what to play. It is not only possible, it is the norm among most of your local, garden variety, neighborhood piano teachers. Those kinds of teachers make up the bulk of the industry and produce the next generation of music majors, who all tend to think as their teachers did. So when one of these classically trained pianists decides to break with tradition and falls for jazz\u2026why do they find it impossible? Because, for one thing, they have been taught to believe that music is written down. If they want to play something new, they must first acquire the sheet music and learn it. There is no other way for them to do it, in their reality\u2026that is simply how one plays music. In jazz, the piano player receives only an outline of the music and suggestions of what to play. These generally come in the form of chord symbols that are completely foreign to classical players. Since these people spent no time developing their ability to play what they hear, they cannot rely on their ears to guide their fingers to the \u201cright\u201d notes and their confidence in their ability to play the piano is pretty much destroyed. They literally cannot put their hands on the piano without knowing or reading what will be played, because their minds tell them that it will surely sound \u201cwrong,\u201d. Considering that they have always focused so strongly on playing \u201ccorrect\u201d notes and fully believe that these are the only acceptable notes to play, it is no surprise that they mentally crash when they are expected to play this way. It is terrifying for them. Only those players who, for some reason, are able to adapt their reality to this way of thinking will be able to conquer this genre. The rest quit and return to the safety and familiarity of their strictly classsical world. They often carry back a bit of envy and awe for jazzers, though they don\u2019t like to admit it. The formally trained who managed to develop their ear in spite of their teachers disapproval, and had the most trouble becoming proficient at sight reading are the ones who tend to be most able to make the switch. This was why I was able to do it. Once I became proficient at jazz the strangest thing happened. Suddenly, all those classical players who had always intimidated the crap out of me, were treating me with a great deal of respect. They asked me questions about how I did it, and were amazed by my improv, even in its infant stages. So to answer your question\u2026as someone who does both\u2026yes classical music as it is traditionally done is far harder to learn and master than jazz, but conquering jazz after spending a lifetime thinking in classical terms, can be almost impossible. That is why classical players say jazz is harder, because for them\u2026it is. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not more difficult, just different. Consider the parallel argument: Why do classical pianists find it so hard to play jazz? In theory, highly skilled classical pianists are trained to perform and replicate written piano compositions with precision. Hence, they can generally speaking replicate a jazz pianist\u2019s performance of a particular song if the jazz composition is written out on sheet music. As a result, the fundamental difference between someone that is trained to play classical music versus jazz is not in their technical/mechanical skills or differences in the notes and rhythms used in classical music vs jazz music. The fundamental difference is that classical piano training does not teach or focus on how to \u201ccompose music\u201d, or how to \u201cspeak the language\u201d (as opposed to reciting text from a book). Serge posted that he surveyed \u201cover 150 classically trained professional musicians with regards to their command of harmony. The results were frightening in that it was disturbingly low by comparison to that of the jazz performer.\u201d Hence the difference between a purely classical pianist and a jazz pianist (including piano improvisation) boils down to this: whether the pianist has tacitly learned and understands (either through training or personal discovery) how, why, and when to play specific note intervals between root notes and melodic notes played on (or sometimes immediately after) the main downbeats, and the specific note intervals between the root notes and notes used to form different chords off the root notes. I took 14 years of classical piano lessons and have been playing for 40+ years, and yet, I was never able to figure out or learn how to play songs by ear on piano, nor did I understand how to transpose songs and play songs in any key. So last summer, I was determined to figure it out for myself after going through much frustration and wasted time studying instructional tips and videos on the web that are all too often incomplete (e.g., the sole focus on tonic-root note intervals - chord progressions) , convoluted, vague (\u201cjust practice\u201d), overly complex, verbose, and/or extraneous. I shake my head in disbelief and am both surprised and frustrated to find how all the instructional websites and online videos on piano improvisation, finding the chords, and/or playing by ear say practically nothing about root-melody note intervals to explain in the simplest possible terms how to spontaneously find the right root/bass notes (and corresponding chords) to go with a melody - other than recommending the use of pure trial and error (for real!), relying on rote memorization of chord progressions used to play specific songs, finding the right melody to go with the chords (not vice versa), using a process that is either overly complex process and/or too vague, or using a process that is too mentally taxing to apply in real-time while attempting to play a song spontaneously on piano (e.g., mentally plowing through the seven triad chords to see which of the seven chords contain the current melodic note). So to try to figure it out on my own, I played traditional Christmas songs all from the key of C or C minor to make it easier to discern (with minimum use of black keys) purely by sight (not by listening - which is ten times harder) the melody-bass note intervals used across different songs. Once I zeroed in on the commonly used note intervals between melodic notes played on the main downbeats and the root/bass notes (with bass note typically at 1, 3, or 5 note intervals below the melodic note), everything suddenly clicked. As I played more songs by ear (finding root notes by simply mirroring what notes I see my right hand is playing on the downbeats), I began to figure out which melody-bass note intervals to play at a specific time, places, and moods within a song. Once I was able to articulate what I learned into a bare-bones help-me-connect-the-dots just-tell-me-what-I-need-DO (not \u201cknow\u201d) scheme (see short 2-minute video and 120 character Tweet), I was shocked and amazed (including my wife and kids) to find myself quite suddenly able to play songs non-stop by ear (so liberating!). I was also surprised to find myself suddenly playing songs in any key for the first time (meaning that I can start a song on any note on the piano without having to remember the song\u2019s original key or figuring out which note to start the song to play it in a specific key). That\u2019s when I truly understood and appreciated the value in learning and practicing the scales! Formulating this how-to-play-piano-by-ear scheme in 100 words (see below) and its sudden impact on my ability to play by ear was, without doubt, a eureka moment I won\u2019t forget. I only wish someone (including my classical piano teacher) had told me from day one to observe the melody-bass note intervals! I believe that this simple concept should be introduced in every music theory book/course! Give it a try yourself and comment below to let me know if you found this helpful and please share your comments and suggestions! HOW TO PLAY PIANO BY EAR IN 100 WORDS Play and end song in key of C to minimize use of black keys and make it easier see intervals between melodic and between root and melodic notes.Identify melodic note played on downbeats and immediately play with left pinky root notes at 1, 3 or 5 intervals (+1 octave) BELOW the melodic note. Use root-melody note interval 1 at end of song. When guessing, try note interval 5 before using 3.Play chords with left hand in fixed claw-like position to roll notes at 1-5-8-10 intervals ABOVE each root note. Add 7 and 9 to jazz it up. Note: The video also explains how (broken down into explicit steps) to figure out which note to start a song to play the song in a specific key - also a process that is surprisingly absent or gleaned over in all the videos and websites on how to improvise and/or play piano by ear! I put out a call to all professional instructional designers to conduct a complete and thorough analysis of the skills needed and used to play piano by ear to see if we can identify more gaps in the music theory teaching and instructional literature!
