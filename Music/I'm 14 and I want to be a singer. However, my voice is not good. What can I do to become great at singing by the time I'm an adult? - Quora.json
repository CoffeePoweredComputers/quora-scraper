            "answer_text": "Seems to me you are at the perfect age to begin. First, realize a couple of things: Nobody\u2019s untrained voice sounds as optimal or is as capable as a voice that has been trained properly. Just like one of the people here said, if you wanted to be a great athlete, would you automatically assume that you couldn\u2019t be one, or would you try to train and join a team to develop? No great athlete goes it alone-they get coaches to help them, and they join a team to get the playing experience. Well, singing is no different. You have to train yourself and get singing experience in order to sing well. A lot of the aspects of projection, proper tone production and range is mostly due to technique you have to be taught, and it isn\u2019t natural-you have to train the body\u2019s vocal mechanism to respond/operate properly, to develop the technical aspects such as range and vocal flexibility, and to create the sound that is necessary to have a great voice. In order to do that, you need a separate set of ears, and that is what the voice teacher provides-a set of ears that can hear you as others hear you, and has the training to teach you and help you develop your technique. You are still young-your voice will change as you age. This is particularly true if you are a boy-men\u2019s voices change drastically during the teen years. The voice you have now at 14 will not be the same voice you will have as a young adult. A singing teacher can help you navigate these physical changes as you continue to grow. I would also like to reiterate one of the answers here in regards to singing opportunities. Singing is one of those things that you can do in addition to other things-you don\u2019t have to be a professional singer in order to be a participant in the music/acting world. In addition to a professional career, there are numerous amateur and part time opportunities that are just as rewarding and as rigorous as professional work. While you are training your voice, you should also be looking for opportunities to get singing experience-look to your school, community, or place of worship for choruses or theater opportunities. I am a singer who is by profession an engineer. I am active in community theater, and church singing. The best community theater productions can give some professional companies a run for their money, so don\u2019t discount that avenue-I have worked with people who are semi professional actors and singers in some community theater productions I\u2019ve been in. And there are plenty of semiprofessional community choruses that will take nonprofessional singers-but you do need to be a very well trained singer. There are also other opportunities as open mic nights, piano bars, bands, community choruses, church choirs/worship teams, and part time professional opportunities such as studio work . As you improve, your voice teacher can help you to explore and locate some of these opportunities, and can help you with selecting the proper music for audition and performance opportunities. ",

            "answer_text": "Practice, practice, practice! The most effective method without having any sort of professional trainer coach you is to practice every facet of singing you think you can improve in. To give just a few examples: Vocal RangeIf you need to practice your range, doing scales 2\u20133 times a day for 5\u201310 minutes can be super helpful. Make sure to use different sounds as well (Fa-la-la-la, Me-me-me-me, Su-su\u2014su-su, etc.) Stretching your vocal cords shortly after you wake up can also help to improve your vocal strength.ToneLots of people can struggle with tone terribly, but I can say many people who try to practice can successfully improve their tone. Doing tonal exercises by singing or humming the same note for an extended period of time can help you learn how to hold a tone which will also improve your vocal strength. You can practice range and tone in the same exercise like in the example i have provided below. (Having a piano or keyboard can help you with this) PronunciationBeing able to clearly understand what you are singing is very important. You can practice pronunciation in many ways but my favorite and most fun way is to sing the lyrics of a song as fast as I can to someone whilst they can still understand what you are singing. It can be tricky, you will probably have to make sure they haven\u2019t heard the sing or know the lyrics to the song you are singing, but if you can pronounce words at high speeds effectively, doing it at slower speeds should come naturally with time.Breathing & MentalityPossibly one of the most important parts of singing is breathing. You do not want to be short of breath, constantly exhaling into the microphone or missing lyrics because you need to take a breath. I find a good way to practice this is to do some basic meditation. Sit down for 5 minutes and just breathe in and out slowly. Try to hold your breath as long as you can. Then stand up and breathe in and out slowly for another 5 minutes. Something as simple as relaxing your muscles and breathing can help your vocal performance tremendously and will also improve your mentality when performing on stage or in a recording studio.PerformanceDepending on what your goals are as a singer, sometimes being able to put on a really good show can trump over an extremely talented voice. You don\u2019t have to be sexy or desirable - of course it can help to have these qualities - but if you are confident in yourself and can get people involved in your singing in some way, that can help tremendously. I\u2019m still trying to find ways to practice this one though, so I can\u2019t give you any tips for performance.These are just a few exercises I use to stretch my singing ability. Please note that as with most things, practice can only stretch your abilities so far. Everybody has their limits and while you may not see results immediately, you may notice some improvement after a few weeks, a few months or even a year or so down the track. From experience, the harsh reality is some people can try and try and still not get the voice they want, but as long as others enjoy your vocal talents then I would not worry. I hope I have helped you with some simple tips from a fellow singer, but remember that if you can afford it and really, truly want nothing more then to be a singer, I highly recommend seeking out a vocal coach for yourself. Depending on how you respond to different methods of training, they can use all sorts of techniques to improve all aspects of your singing and performance. Cheers. ",
