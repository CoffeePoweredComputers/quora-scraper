            "answer_text": "For the first time I am writing a real big answer to your question, Let's get started. Enrique is not underrated. You can't just tell if someone's underrated or overrated just by keeping the track of the people around you I mean it's like you are in a society where you and some other people who surround you don't listen to ENRIQUE and you pass your conclusion that he's underrated. I can show you some proofs that ENRIQUE IS NOT UNDERRATED. He's one of the people who make highest amount of money per concert.  So, you can see that he's not one of those who are underrated or paid less. Now lemme tell you something. Do you really believe that someone who gets more than one billon views in his songs can be underrated? No right? Lemme show you that the person who you think to be underrated got more than one billion views in his songs in YouTube.  So what do you think? Though it doesn't really matter what you think about him. Anyways. The other persons, who thought your questin was right and answered according to your question, I am pleading them please don't put your wrong answers. At least do some research before writing them. Cause you'd better not write the answer than writing the wrong one. Enrique's album got triple platinum from India only. You can't imagine how famous and rich he is. And more over that he's a real good person and he's the best at singing for me at least. Do you know there is always half a dozen of ambulance ready outside his every concertg. You know why? Because a lot of his fans get fainted to see him in front of them. And I guess if I'm ever going to have a chance to see him I'll faint too, out of happiness. He's got a lot of admirers, more than you can ever imagine. Give a try to his songs, listen to at least 20 songs and maybe you'll get to understand that his voice is the most melodious and satisfying in the whole world. I'm telling you he is the BEST. You don't need to believe me but I'm just being real. He's really the best singer ever.   I love him. He's my hero and my life inspiration.  Thanks for reading, if you did. ",

            "answer_text": "I do think Enrique Iglesias is underrated, at least in the English market. He has only two #1 on Billboard Hot 100 compared to 26 on Hot Latin Songs. He had a quite disappointing career beginning from low sales of his album 7. The same trend was seen in Insomniac, though it was quite a major hit in Europe. Songs rarely touched the Hot 100, though he got lots of no 1s in France, Russia etc. Even now, be I believe the following is the reason:- 1. Enrique Iglesias' music is too generic. Definitely. Listen to I Like It, and then I'm A Freak. \"Freak\" sounded a half hearted attempt to make a party song. And the trashy verse from Pitbull. It was preceded by flops like Turn The Night Up, Heart Attac, a minor hit Finally Found You. 2. Small English Fan Base. Yeah, its true. If it were large, he would have success on average tracks too. Instead, they disappeared without much sign on Billboards. His songs must be very, very good to chart. Don't get me wrong. His Spanish songs can be more successful than English songs of most other artists. Bailando became 10th best selling song of 2014, which is a big achievement considering the fact that most people who have bought it did not understand it. Moreover his songs sell very well in Latin America. Sex and Love got 9 Platinums in this region, but fared poorly outside. So ultimately its the question of which market you are talking about. He should concentrate more on Spanish, or so it seems for now. BTW I'm a die hard EI fan, but this is the truth. ",
