            "answer_text": "Scott Joplin was a charming composer but far from the \u201cmost important\u201d American composer. Joplin\u2019s work was limited almost entirely to his rags, mostly for solo piano, roughly the equivalent of Chopin\u2019s mazurkas, which were wonderful but just a niche within that composer\u2019s much greater body of work. To elevate Joplin too high would be to rank him ahead of many American composers with voluminous and wide-ranging output, composers whose names are permanently etched in music history. Charles Ives, George Gershwin, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, Elliott Carter, Thelonius Monk, Aaron Copland, Stephen Sondheim, Frank Zappa, Cole Porter, and Bob Dylan\u2019s names all spring to mind as persons who have had monumentally important careers in the pantheon. Joplin\u2019s work does not rise to the level of any of them. And surely if I gave it some thought, I could name several more before arriving at Scott Joplin. But Joplin\u2019s music is certainly enjoyable and fun to listen to. My intention here is not to discredit his work in any way but simply to answer the question asked. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know that he was the most important (consider George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland), but he certainly was the most underappreciated American composer during his lifetime. Joplin helped invent ragtime and became its most influential proponent. Ragtime was one of the foundations of jazz, which arose after Joplin's death. He was not taken very seriously during his lifetime, in part because he was black. His real dream was to write opera, and indeed his opera \"Treemonisha\" was published and performed after he died. Joplin gained the fame he deserved only with the ragtime revival of the 1970s, spurred by the use of his music in the film \"The Sting.\" The ultimate tribute to the man is that you can now buy an edition of his works published by Schirmer, which is the per-eminent publisher of classical music in the United States.
