Youssou N'Dour has worked Zucchero, Peter Gabriel, and recorded a duet with Neneh Cherry. Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 recorded a CD with Ry Cooder and was an amazing blues guitarist. Those are just a few examples from my regular playlists. There are so many others, a world of beautiful and amazing music just waiting to be discovered.

            "answer_text": "It is not a mainstream genre, but it definitely has its fans in the UK. The music of Fela Kuti - Afrobeat - is quite hip in some circles in the UK and US. Nigerian pop music: in the shadow of Fela Kuti The last African artist I saw in concert was Kanda Bongo Man, who is Congolese, at the Royal Festival Hall in London. It is in any case hard to speak of \u2018African\u2019 music as a whole, as it is so diverse. I have played with musicians from Benin, Nigeria and South Africa, and the influences and styles are different. South African musicians were very active in London when I was playing live in the 80s, because they were refugees from apartheid, so they influenced a lot of other jazz and soul/r& b musicians then. I know that lots of styles have developed all over the continent in the many years since then. ",
