            "answer_text": "No research to support this other than life experience but this is what I have observed:- Taken across all ages and abilities, alto sax is the most common. Typically students start on alto and move on to other saxes. Alto has had a resurgence particularly due house music. It is the most commonly used in classical music.Tenor is next most popular overall, and possibly the leader if you ignore beginners. The most important in rock and pop, r'n'b etcDifficult to know for sure whether baritone or soprano have more players. Soprano would have been in decline for several decades, but more common recently. Baritone is a staple of big bands, sax quartets and sometimes, when there are 3 or more players, rock and pop horn sections. Admirers of Leo P might drive up the baritone numbers.The remaining members of the saxophone family, soprano, saville, bass and contrabass, probably don't add up to a whole lot. If your question was actually about saxophone makes and models, rather than sizes, apologies! ",
