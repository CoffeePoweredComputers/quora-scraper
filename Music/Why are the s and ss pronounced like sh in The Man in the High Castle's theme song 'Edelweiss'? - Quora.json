            "answer_text": "Here is a theory: I wonder if the singer is either Japanese or supposed to sound Japanese. The L sound in English is particularly difficult for Japanese speakers to prounouce. So I wonder if the singer is trying to approximate the Japanese way of annunciating English with a sound that doesn\u2019t sound authentic to a native English speaker\u2019s ears. It would also fit the show as Edelweiss is a song that represents the Nazi annexation of Austria. It is a bittersweet song about a native flower of Austria. The United States is now the divided territory of the Pacific States (Japan) and the Reich (Germany). So it would fit with the idea that the land is now taken over by the Germans in reference to the origin of the song from The Sound of Music. Captain Von Trapp is singing about his beloved homeland, Austria. But the American States also belong to Japan, so a Japanese singer adds to the poignancy. That is what I have been thinking as I listen to the song and watch the show. ",

            "answer_text": "Taken from Megan Garber\u00b4s article \u2018Edelweiss\u2019: An American Song for Global Dystopia published in The Atlantic. The Man in the High Castle\u2019s theme song, which is of course a version of another show\u2019s theme song, is haunting both because of and despite its familiarity. Here is the iconic tune from The Sound of Music\u2014a love song to a person, a love song to a country, a love song to all that is swept up in the phrase \u201cway of life\u201d\u2014transformed into an anthem of dystopia. Here is a story about the tyrannies of fascism, set to a song that is known\u2014or, at least, that has been known\u2014for being soft and lush and lullaby-like. Here is a song of freedom, transformed into one of despair. Which is all extremely effective as a (musical) rhetorical device. \u201cEdelweiss,\u201d here, is performed by the Swedish singer Jeanette Olsson, and her icy, sparse rendition infuses the song\u2019s sibilants with an extra, telling hiss. Adding to the creepiness of the whole thing are the images that accompany the song: Mount Rushmore, the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline \u2026 all of them, like the song, familiar and yet eerily changed.
