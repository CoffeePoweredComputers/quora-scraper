            "answer_text": "This is a very common situation that even I have faced a lot of times. Here's how it actually happens. As you know, change is the hardest thing to face. Your liking of anything at all depends on the standards you have in mind for that particular thing. At first any deviation from those standards makes you have a bad vibe for that thing. However, repeated exposure to a particular thing forces your mind to develop a sense of familiarity. Similar is the case for songs. If you have a particular genre or standard for the songs you like then any deviation from that standard makes you hate the song at first. However, we get habituated by being exposed to the same stimuli. The dislike decreases after repeated presentations and the likeness may occur. At the same time, your mind getting used to this latest exposure alters those stubborn standards that made you hate the song at first. The hate that we experience at first is just an experience of 'change' which on repetitive listening becomes the experience of 'familiarity'. And that is why we start liking a song that is played more often when we didn't like it when we listened to it for the first time. ",
