            "answer_text": "Real Producer's don't acutally sell beats, they produce finished records. The responsibility of a Record Producer is to oversee the entire production of Master Recordings from A to Z down to mixing and mastering stage as they generally collaborate with the Vocalist and Engineer in the studio that controls the recording sessions. The Producer is not only there to realize their own vision but also to help realize the Artist's vision as well as there's alot more to involved in the creative production process than just making a beat. Vocal production is just as important. So if you want to make a lot more money than just selling beats for a pop, start learning how to do vocal production and get in the studio with an Artist as you make far more money producing a finished song that is complete. There's so many ways a Producer is compensated for their work. Generally a Producer is paid an Advance per Masters which is a pre-payment of future royalties from sale of records. The Producer via a Letter of Direction is also entitled to a percentage share of the Artists Digital Performing Sound Recording royalties such as SoundExchange if they ask for record Points since they contributed to producing the Master's. On the Publishing side, if the Producer contributed as a Co-Writer, they are entitled to Peformance and Mechanical royalties. So if you make beats, you are also a Songwriter as the Composer. A Song is 50% Music and 50% Lyrics. make sure you are registered with ASCAP or BMI and sign up with Songtrust to collect your global publishing royalties. Many Hip Hop Producer's are generally Hybrid Producer's that wears two or more hats as they are a combination of a Composer and an Orchestrator such as Teddy Reily, Pharrell Williams, Scott Storch, J.R Rotem, Timbaland, Oak Felder, Dr. DRE, Rodney Jerkins, Bryan-Michael Cox, Tricky Stewart etc. They all physically collaborate with the Artist in the studio as non of them acutally sells beats. You can also make money in Film T.V. Commercial Video Game placments through Master use and Sync Licenses as the Composer. ",
