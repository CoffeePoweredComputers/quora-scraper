            "answer_text": "Before K-pop, the majority of the music made in Korea were considered to be \u2018healthy\u2019 songs, they were commissioned by the government then continuously promoted on wildly popular government run radio and music shows. The group \u2018Seo Taiji and boys\u2019 is known to be the group that introduced the new genre of music, which is now labelled as K-pop. They performed it on a competition show, and even though the judges didn\u2019t like the performance, it resonated with the teenagers across the country, only one decade before the most popular song in Korea was a patriotic anthem wrapped into an 80s pop song (this is an example of a healthy song). It was a brand new style of music in Korea and became popular mostly amongst Korean teenagers. Seo Taiji and Boys was a defining moment in South Korean History that showed cultural progress. Dance performances, fashion, members and concepts that are incorporated in K-pop are well-known to be new, fresh and popular. K-pop constantly experiments with new styles of music and styles which has allowed it to be interesting and inspiring. The global phenomenon of Kpop also works in the form of generations, a new one starting when the priors most popular artists prominence dies down. Popular first generation (early 1990s- 2000s) artists include Seo Taiji, BoA, H.O.T, Rain and Shinwa- even at this early stage of the industry, the music was influenced by popular western artists, the international marketability for these groups would have been very possible.     The second generation of Kpop was full of unique artists, in this period (2003- 2009/10) groups gained more enthusiasts their popularity mostly spreading across Eastern Asia. This movement of Kpop is dubbed as Hallyu otherwise named \u2018the korean wave\u2019. The unique choreography, captivating lyrics and distinct visuals captured the eyes and hearts of many. Groups that rose to fame include: Brown Eyed Girls, Girls Generation, TVXQ, (f)x, 2NE1, SISTAR, Big Bang and SHINee.     The third generation is perhaps the most successful generation of Kpop. Kpop has evolved from the first generation up to the present era (2011- 2018/20). It has become more creative, expressive and interesting. The music has become more modern with combinations of lots of music stylings like techno, rock, ballad, hip- hop and indie, etc. More often than not groups having multiple genres mixed into one song. Companies are more open to producing groups with different ethnicities. Performances are now even more extravagant and entertaining. With groups like BTS, Twice, NCT, Red Velvet, Exo, Blackpink, Eric Nam,Got7, Bolbbalgan4 and Seventeen sweeping across the globe and breaking multitudes of records in both the Asian and Western markets.     There is a small debate on whether the fourth generation has begun (2019- ) , as a new generation often begins when the prior generations most popular artists prominence dies down. Though the third-gen is still as popular as ever (with BTS arguably being the most popular and best boy group of all time- even rivalling and being compared to the Beatles), as well as with a variety of different artists from the second and even first generation of Kpop still promoting- I feel there is a distinction between them and the new groups debuting. With a new influx of groups with about 100 debuting per year, this then makes it really hard to get noticed, so some amazing groups that have made really successful debuts recently include: Tomorrow x Together, (G)I-dle, Oneus, ITZY, Ateez, BVNDIT, THE BOYZ and Everglow.

            "answer_text": "Roughly, gen1 is the 90s, gen2 is the 00s, gen3 is the 10s. It\u2019s debatable if a gen4 has emerged already. It\u2019s harder to divide generations now because in the past we say a generation ends when the groups fade out of public attention, but that is no longer the case. Note that there are transition generations, and that girl groups and boy groups do not have identical timelines. One of the easiest and fastest ways to look at past kpop generation is to just track the SM debuts. They seem to be very clear markers per generation. SM debuted the first boy group, the first girl group, some of the biggest gen2 icons (starting with DBSK, then subsequently Super Junior and SNSD), and before BTS surged to popularity EXO was almost without competition. In recent years it's a little harder to use SM debuts as a landmark because the market is increasingly saturated and competition is stronger and more diverse, esp with the previous rush of survival show debuts. Boundaries are increasingly blurred especially as groups' lifespan (and popularity) drags longer. Tracing back, kpop started in 1996 (with the debut of H.O.T. who is considered the first idol band, formed after American groups like Backstreet Boys and N SYNC). There were other Korean artists before that such as Roo'ra (you might know Lee Sangmin from the show Knowing Brothers) and Turbo (similarly you might know Kim Jongkook from the show Running Man), but they were packaged as singers, not idols (aka good looks, fashionable outfits, synchronized dances and refined behaviours etc). The term idol was introduced by H.O.T. Gen 1 was interesting because their rivalry almost always occur in pairs (maybe because there simply weren\u2019t a lot of groups then and multi-fandom isn\u2019t a thing so it is a very either-or question). After H.O.T. debuted in 1996 (under SM), the DSP director quickly jumped in and formed boy band Sechs Kies in 1997. Their rivalry remains a legend. Then SM debuts girl group SES in the same year, DSP follows with FinKL in the next. Shinhwa (1998) was always pitched against G.O.D. (1999) for comparison of performance. There were also some classic solo debuts such as BoA (SM, 2000), Rain (JYP, 2002) and Seven (YG, 2003).The gen1 idols didn\u2019t last long due to many economic complications (both of the Korean/Asia economy and the companies' economy). By early 2003 most of the groups have disbanded or went on hiatus, their average lifespan was 5 years. The soloist previously mentioned, and previous idols turned soloist (such as Lee Hyori from FinKL and Kim Taewoo from G.O.D.) were still in the market.From here, the generation divide gets a little tricky because the boy/girl groups start to diverge a little. For the boy groups, gen 2 started with the debut of DBSK/TVXQ in Dec 2003. Them, and subsequently debuts like SS501 and Super Junior filled in the immense gap in the idol industry left behind by their seniors. These 3 groups were the top bands in Korea and Asia generally, and stayed so for quite a few years. Big Bang made their debut in 2006 but their climb was considerably slower (they really started booming in the 2010s I think, but before that songs like Lie and Haru Haru definitely helped to build a strong base). I'd say there's also a gen 2.5 that acts as a transition from gen 2 to gen 3, led by groups such as SHINee, 2pm, Beast and Infinite. I'd say the true transition of gen 2 is in 2009-10 though, which is marked by the huge lawsuit of 3 members from DBSK, who were hands down the most popular group then. Their near-disbandment and long hiatus to recover gave other groups a chance to spring up (there was almost a no-brainer question as to who the Daesang goes to when DBSK was around then), and also the Korean economy was slowly recovering from the severe IMF crisis.I'd say for boy bands, they fully entered gen 3 in 2012, marked by the debut of EXO. Also concurrently, roughly about this time gen2 groups start to face military enlistment. This was interesting because gen1 groups never lasted long enough to go through military service (apart from Shinhwa who did their service while fighting a lawsuit with SM, so their team was still on hiatus then). No one knew if their groups will still be around so uncertainty and insecurity was high. Gen2 was the first batch of idols who started to enlist while their group continued having activities (also made possible by growing group sizes).The gen2 girl groups started to flourish by the second half of 2000s (there was quite a huge gap between the disbandment of gen1 girl groups until gen2 girl groups). In fact, some of the most iconic girl groups of the second generation made their debut either in 2007 or 2009. In 2007 you have Girls Generation, Wonder Girls and KARA. In 2009 you have 2nE1, 4 Minute, TARA, After School, f(x) and Secret. Up till 2014 you have groups like Miss A, Sistar, Apink, AOA and EXID. I suppose the OG gen2 groups would be the 2007 and 2009 debuts, with the others being a more gen2.5-ish. A trait people often associate gen2 with is hook songs like Sorry Sorry and Gee. But gen2 is so much more diverse than that (before and after the hook-song period) and I wish more people who see and recognize that. Gen3 starts in 2012 for the boys with EXO's debut, from then larger groups (the average gen1 groups have 5 members, gen2 had slightly more where 7\u20138 became the norm, nowadays groups can have 10 or more and people won\u2019t bat an eye) targetting diverse audience really start to flourish. Iconic groups so far would also have groups like BTS, Seventeen, Wanna One. Girl groups start slightly later around 2014 and you have icons like Twice, Red Velvet, Mamamoo and Black Pink. A unique feature is the rise of reality survival programs (not necessarily idols alone, we also have K-pop Star for singers and Show Me The Money for hiphop). Some companies had their own show, like SM's Rookies, JYP's Sixteen and Straykids, YG's WIN: who is next and Treasure Box, if I remember correctly Seventeen and Monsta X had pre-debut reality shows too. Of course, none of these shows truly reached the level of hype that was attained by the Produce series. The resulting 'products' each season (I.O.I. from 101, Wanna One from 202, Izone from 48 and X1 from X) have achieved incredible heights after TV exposure. Given the current developments, it seems like Izone and X1 have a misted future, but we have seen with certainty how well I.O.I. and Wanna One did before disbandment, and Izone and X1 weren't doing too bad either until the news imploded.I am quite sure we have transitioned to gen4 by now, but I truly don't know when that happened. I\u2019d say groups like G-idle, Itzy and TXT are gen4 though, but it\u2019s very blurry. PS: If you're interested to find out more fun facts about gen1 and gen2 you can check out this blog post[1] I wrote two years back. The gen3 part is quite outdated so you can skip that haha. Personally I got into kpop during gen2 and used to have an immense curiosity for gen1 so I dug into them more. Footnotes [1] Kpop from 1990s to now: my totally unprofessional summary (revised) ",
