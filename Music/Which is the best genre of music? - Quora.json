            "answer_text": "I have taken part in this sort of discussion many times. I truly think each person would have a different opinion of what the best genre is. Having said that, one must ask oneself this question-\u201dWhat is it that constitutes the best genre? \u201c Is it that a certain type of music remains popular for centuries, as a lot of Classical Music does? (Remember, though, that a lot of composers of Classical music are long forgotten or never quite measured up to the geniuses, say in the case of Salieri vs. Mozart, the rivalry depicted in the movie AMADEUS. So, instead what is it that makes the long-lasting music great?\u2026well, I believe that it is due to the complexity of such music. Some would say that, because of that complexity, it remains intriguing to people. The same people would say that some pop and rock is too simple to last long, and I agree with that. As a music teacher myself, one who has purchased many a set of music books for the schools where I\u2019ve taught, I still remember the year I noticed that The Beatles\u2019 songs started appearing in music texts. This is significant, because, most of the time, such music goes in and out so quickly that it makes no sense to include it in expensive music text series that have to last a very long time in a school. Now, before non-classical fans jump on my case, remember that I am just throwing out possible explanations. I truly believe it is the passion, the beautiful melodies, the complexity, the interweave of many musicians involved that has made a lot of Classical music last for centuries. Having said that, I love other types of music, too. I\u2019ve performed in many Musical Theater productions, and can so appreciate the craftsmanship and solid writing of people like Rodgers and Hammerstein. Too, I love songs like \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d from Presley\u2019s days. Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain\u201d is a favorite of mine. I love singing and teaching about the folk music of this country and other parts of the world. I love Big Band Music and so appreciate the genius of Duke Elllington, as well. So, I guess the answer comes down to this-the best genre is what you think it is-what works for you as music you come back to over and over and over, whatever the genre is. ",

            "answer_text": "Hard rock. Actual instruments are played showing genuine talent unlike a lot of popular artists who just sample beats by just clicking a few buttons. I prefer hard rock to other genres of rock because it\u2019s a lot more varied. You can have super heavy hard rock songs but then also you can have really emotional slower songs. I feel that in heavy metal it\u2019s all heavy, there\u2019s not much variation in that genre and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best. The vocal range in hard rock is usually very varied and sang by great talented singers, it\u2019s more complicated than rap which is basically just words on the same note said fast. Plus if you listen to bands like The Pretty Reckless and Halestorm you notice that every song is different. Pop music kind of bores me as usually the whole song has a chord progression of the same four chords over and over again and the tracks in pop albums are all literally about love and how they were heartbroken and how sad they are or something boring like that. In hard rock, heartbreak songs are usually portrayed with style, a bit of hate and some badass guitar riffs. Plus all of the females in hard rock do what the fuck they want. They wear what they want and don\u2019t give one what other people think. A lot of the females in pop eg Ariana Grande set extremely high standards for young girls and I think people nowadays care wayyy too much about their appearance. I used to be like that but hard rock has banished most of that self hate. It\u2019s taught me to be stronger, embrace the darkness and get on doing what I want to do. ",
