            "answer_text": "There are plenty! Here\u2019s a few links with description and different OS options: Free DAWs: The Best Available in 2018 - Produce Like A Pro The 10 Best Free DAWs Available - RouteNote Blog You can make great music on any of those, no matter what style of music you do. Try a few out and see which ones fit your workflow the best. I almost forgot\u2026 Once you pick one, be sure to get some VST plugins! There are all kinds of VST effects available, and many great ones are free. Just Google \u201cfree VST plugins\u201d. There is everything from EQs to Compressors, Multiband Compressors, Limiters, Maximizers, Delays, Reverbs, Etc., including lots of great emulations of famous classic studio gear. Go crazy and get as many as you can find! If you don\u2019t like some, you can delete or uninstall them. But I\u2019ve found that many I thought were useless, were just the exact thing I needed in some special situations. If you plan to record electric guitars, Ignite amps has some awesome VSTs, not only to simulate amps and amp cabinets, but also some very good PulTec EQs. (If you don\u2019t know what that is, you\u2019re in for a treat\u2026! But do watch some tutorials on them, because they\u2019re not 100% intuitive). Even if you\u2019re recording guitars played through a great amp, running it through a cabinet simulator can really sweeten it up. I love just about all the Ignite VSTs. You\u2019ll also need some IR response files to use with the cab simulators. Plenty of those free too. (So many it will be hard to choose! Try a bunch to see which ones you like best.) - Also Guitar Rig has a free version. It\u2019s a bit of a CPU hog, but it has many wonderful presets that can give you tones you wouldn\u2019t believe wasn\u2019t a real amp. Need a metal amp? Check. Playing a country song? It\u2019s got you covered. Want to sound like Santana? Yep! There\u2019s a great preset for that. You won\u2019t believe your ears! You\u2019ll think you\u2019ve died and gone to musician heaven. If you are more into synthesizers, there\u2019s also plenty of free VSTi plugin synths. Most DAWs have some synths built in, but expanding your \u201cpalette\u201d will give you plenty of choices that you\u2019ll love when you\u2019re looking for just that certain sound. And oh yeah\u2026 Drums\u2026 Can\u2019t forget those! Google \u201cMT Power Drums\u201d. That\u2019s a free VSTi with some great drum sounds and plenty of built-in in midi drums patterns to choose from. Even if you want a way different drum sound, the midi patterns are quite good. You are embarking on a journey of wonderment and exhilaration! Have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Online : SnapJam, SoundTrap, Audio Tool, Soundation, Looplabs. These all are mostly for fun and you would not get the tools required to make a song of YOUR OWN choice as these all provide a limited number of instruments and require you to pay for a premium of their service. If you are a beginner, choose this option. Offline : You require a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to make songs. There are many good free softwares like LMMS, CakeWalk Studio, Pro Tools First, REAPER (almost free), etc. Most of them are paid but offer much better tools (e.g. FL Studio, Ableton etc.) There are online tutorials for all of these. Check YouTube. ",
