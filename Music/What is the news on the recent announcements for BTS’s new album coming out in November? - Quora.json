            "answer_text": "Yes, you heard everyone: BTS is coming out with an official album this November. All the details have been released by BigHit Entertainment themselves, starting with the fact that pre orders for the Deluxe Edition will begin September 28th woohoot!  The new album will be called \u201cBe.\u201d Many theories have arisen about what this title may mean, but to me, I feel like it has many meanings behind it. I believe it is a play on words for \u201cBe yourself\u201d or \u201cBe you\u201d as they also described in their UN speech this past week that we must continue living on and being ourselves. It\u2019s quite natural that their new album would be directed towards the global pandemic and how we can all heal from these dark times. A fan also theorized that the new album has to do with the number 7 and here\u2019s why:  If you think about it, I feel like this is a great theory and could have a role in the many meanings behind the title, \u201cBe.\u201d Here is the official statement from BigHit themselves in regards to this new album being released in November:   Whatever \u201cBe\u201d may be referencing to, we know from what BigHit said as well as the message BTS has been making aware of recently that this new album has to have a message that \u201cwe must live on.\u201d We must continue to grow and love ourselves. That part we know. This album has to do with healing ourselves and continuing to thrive and be ourselves during this tough time. The other part that was announced by BigHit\u2014but we already knew from the members previously\u2014is the fact that this album will in fact incorporate many styles of music. It will have the classic BTS-esque, but also incorporate many different interesting genres to reach all people from different corners of the globe. The final part of this announcement that I\u2019d like to break down is the fact that this new project will in fact be an album. BTS has done extended projects in the form of EP\u2019s where there were only 7-8 songs on the track. A great is example is Map of the Soul Persona. The way BigHit and BTS are presenting this news is that they will be releasing an album. If this is referencing to a real full-on album, then it would be somewhat like Map of the Soul 7 where there were many, many songs. I would love to see another full album to grow my own playlist, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on getting a full album with 20 songs again. They already did that earlier this year and just with the time constraints, it seems like a ton of work for BTS. Either way, as time goes on, we will find out more news. :) I\u2019m so excited and I\u2019m sure all of us Army\u2019s are too! What do you think about all of this?
