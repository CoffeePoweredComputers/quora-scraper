            "answer_text": "From downloading music in Mp3, Mp4, WMA, AAA and various other formats to streaming it on our own smartphones, we have come a long way. In fact, when you stream music on your device of choice today, there is no downloading of the music needed. You don\u2019t have to go through the wait of finishing download, you selected music is played almost instantly. Streaming services work very differently from the older way of downloading music. There are no music files saved on the hard drive of your device and you have to stream the same song again if you want to listen to it again. When you stream music, a small packet of the audio file is delivered so that the data is played instantaneously on your device. As long as there is an uninterrupted, steady stream of packets of audio data delivered to your device, the music will keep on playing. Your device gets the music in the form of signals and the decoder on your end transforms it back into the form of music that you get to listen ultimately. So the chain here includes your server, the information stream and the decoder in your device, to play the streaming music successfully.  Although, there are some service providers that provide the option to download too so that you can still play your songs even when you have no internet connection for streaming. Music live streaming services are basically of two types: radio and on-demand streaming. Popular examples of radio streaming are apps like iHeartRadio and Pandora, whereas popular examples of on-demand music streaming are apps like Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, etc. But, how do these streaming companies get the music? Companies like Apple music or amazon music approach music labels with different deals or plans and negotiate to reach a point where all parties involved agree. The contract thus formed can be is usually a year-long one but it depends on one label to another. Your streaming service provider has to pay the publisher of the music to get the rights to stream it online. Currently, millions of people listen to internet radio and use other popular music streaming platforms. It is not only easily accessible, but it is also quick and hassle-free to have thousands of songs available to you without actually bothering to download them. ",
