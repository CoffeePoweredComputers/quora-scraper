            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s take a few things into account here. F(x) fans are a stable fandom, but not very big\u2014 if you compare them with other kpop fan groups, this would be one of the smaller ones. Although I cannot say excactly what the issue is, here are a few suggestions (I\u2019m assuming that you are talking about the lack of views?) it\u2019s been a long time since f(x) produced any content. That said, none of their songs in the past were as impactful enough to leave the fans anticipating for their comeback, if you compare it to the amount of attention groups like BlackPink got. I think single hits are one of the main drives for attention in the future.maybe it\u2019s also because only Luna is performing in the Even So? Fans can be left nostalgic when only one member is starting off a new album era.people change. The more time passes by, the more our interests and tastes in music mold.There was not enough \u201chype\u201d before the actual comeback\u2014 it was announced pretty recently, so the news did not have time to travel through the media. Plus, with the overwhelming influence of bigger groups\u2019 comebacks, it\u2019s hard to get some spotlight.all that said, I think it\u2019s a great comeback. I am excited for everything to begin! Just because there is not a lot of attention, it doesn\u2019t mean that the content is bad! :)) ",

The group\u2019s fandom is also super divided and most are only fans of individual girls rather than the whole band. Her first solo, Free Somebody, was amazing and it got no attention whatsoever. ",
