            "answer_text": "Because I can't find a single reason where it's doesn't seem to be important. There are numerous reasons to know the importance of adventure in our life.  Adventure is something that takes out the pain physically or mentally while in the process, we never are the same as we are before the adventure and there! we already started having the vibes. Adventures don't mean you have to go somewhere especially for experiencing it. You can do anywhere, just need to get out of the comfort zone, it's might being tough at the first but sooner or later it's going to get addicted and you surely not going to get a reason to go back. You can do or try a bunch of adventure things while traveling and it helps in overcome the fear. Of course, this is our one only life who doesn't want to live to the fullest and adventure is something that will help.

            "answer_text": "Adventure implies experiencing the new, probably a little scary too. Doing it repeatedly allows us to practice leaving our comfort zone. Shows us that we need not overcome our fear. We can act despite our fears. That said - a common misnomer is about where adventure is to be found. Images of bungee jumping, sky diving, foreign trips come to mind. I have seen some Indians stay in a new country for several years. They stay in Indian neigborhoods, have an Indian friend circle, shop from Indian groceries, eat at Indian resturants, and celebrate Indian festivals. They book a tour package for a foreign country trip only if it offers Indian food(preferably in their regional style). Where is the adventure? On the other hand, you can experience adventure on a daily basis in the most \u2018routine\u2019 environments. Talk to that girl you are attracted to, try listening to a viewpoint that deeply contradicts yours, sign up for that art class, take on that new project, learn a new skill, learn something without having the certainty of \u2018ROI\u2019, have a cold water bath, experience an acclaimed movie/book you thought you won\u2019t like(I discovered Harry Potter books that way\u20265 years late!), write your first Quora answer, express your heart felt opinion even if you are worried about your grammar and convincing skills, help someone without knowing \u201cWhats in it for you\u201d, try a new item on the menu, try on a color you did not try before, try talking to your parents about something you thought they will never understand but wish they did... Take a risk. There are thousands of opportunities. As humans - We will always be tempted to stay inside our comfort zone. But adventure allows us to expand it. The expansion does not happen from the increasing number of things you do, but the increasing amount of fear and uncertainty you welcome. It is your right to choose NOT to expand. But then don\u2019t be surprised if you feel \u2018unfulfilled\u2019 or \u2018stagnated\u2019. Uncertainty when resisted becomes sufferingUncertainty when accepted becomes adventure. Important Tip: When you try something new(say a movie), try it with a commitment to make the best out of that time and enjoy the movie to the maximum possible extent. Not to conclude whether \u201cI was right in not liking this kind of movie?\u201d If you do the latter, you will only watch for those parts that prove you right. ",
