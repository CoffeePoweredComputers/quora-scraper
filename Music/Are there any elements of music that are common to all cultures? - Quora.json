            "answer_text": "Answering this question would be to define \u2018music\u2019 itself. After all, the word \u2018music\u2019 is something used in Western culture to refer to something we commonly consider as an \u2018object\u2019. Western culture classifies music experiences and considers them the possession of a single (genius) mind that crafted it. Works by Bach or Mozart are considered as exactly that, \u2018works\u2019 - objects. And not just any objects, they are beautiful works of art, attributed to the \u2018genius\u2019 who created them. Today, we can buy these works, just as you might buy furniture. And just as we will compare some crappy plywood to a mahogany antique, it is common to find people who will deride entire categories of music-objects such as \u2018Rap\u2019 as poorly crafted compared to other more carefully-crafted categories such as \u2018Progressive Rock\u2019. \u2018Classical Music\u2019 however stands at the top, preserved in the museum (concert-hall) of worthy Western art objects, to be occasionally displayed for our admiration. But this view of \u2018music\u2019, as object-centered, isn\u2019t even universal in itself. In many cultures, what we call music has no word, yet it appears often integrated with dance and other arts. So immediately there\u2019s a difficulty - how can we define \u2018music\u2019 when the word we use to describe it is already a product of cultural assumptions?  Bach\u2019s music is often considered to be \u2018universal\u2019, yet even the notion of \u2018Bach\u2019 himself as a music-author is a cultural notion, let alone selling through capitalist economics his \u2018best hits\u2019. This is a problem that basically we can\u2019t get past, so I mention it to remind the reader that we\u2019re a little stuck trying to find commonalities between \u2018music\u2019 if we can\u2019t leave our culture. That being said, we can still approach the subject so long as we are careful to be aware of our presuppositions. To give this topic its full attention, I\u2019d need to write a book, so excuse me if I\u2019m not careful enough myself.  \u2018Musical\u2019 Universals Although it may seem impossible to talk of \u2018music\u2019 without falling into cultural traps, it nonetheless seems that all the world partakes in something that we recognize as being \u2018musical\u2019. As John Blacking shows in How Musical is Man, we seem to produce \u2018humanly organized sound\u2019 and consequently \u2018soundly organized humanity\u2019. I think that this is a good attempt at describing what appears to be universally \u2018musical\u2019 - it is not just organized sound, but a process that organizes us too. Thus humans organizing sound and sounds organizing humanity is the first common feature of what we may call that thing which is \u2018musical\u2019 all across the world. Indeed, music, as we call it, shares these features. Humanly Organized Sound So regarding \u2018humanly organised sound\u2019, what can we say are common organizational features? Well, luckily music psychologists have put in a lot of work to find out how the cognitive capacities of the brain create common \u2018musical\u2019 structures. To put it simply, the brain is always trying to reduce and simplify complex sets of data. As a result, it tends to try and find patterns. As we repeat patterns, it begins to like them and can use them to predict future events. Through this, we get expectation and anticipation, and with it denial or fulfillment of expectation. In other words, we get an emotional response. So what patterns do we commonly use when organizing sound? They can include the following (compiled from Brown & Jordania (2013) and Peretz (2006)): Scales using 5\u20137 pitches (because memory can only handle 5\u20139 concepts at once, see Miller 1956).Unequal intervals between notes in a scale, such as 2nds and 3rds (by making it unequal, our brains can remember it better).Octave equivalency (in other words, after 5\u20137 notes you end up back on the note you started with - this really helps to reduce cognitive load).Melodic phrases and motifs (in other words, melodies can be subdivided into smaller repeated units).Meters and repeated rhythmic patterns (just as melody is based on small units joining together to make a larger phrase, so is rhythm small repeated units to create an expectation of recurrence over time, a \u2018meter\u2019 or \u2018time signature\u2019).Music psychologists have noticed some other things that seem to be common traits across most of the worlds music, including: Predominance of singing (this makes sense, given the voice is the most easily accessible musical instrument).Music being mixed with other artistic forms, such as dance (so inseparable that many cultures don\u2019t even distinguish between these elements).Lullabies (this was noted by Sandra Trehub, who has suggested in many articles that mothers singing to infants is a way for the infants to learn the contours and emotional meaning of language).The use of idiophones, aerophones and drums.Shared cultural patterns? The discussion above shows that we generally organize sound through limiting our resources and repeating smaller units so they become larger ones. But is that all we can say about music before it becomes all culturally different? This is a very hard question to answer. The people best prepared to answer it are ethnomusicologists, the group of scholars that study different music traditions across the world. From my study of Ethnomusicology, I believe that there is a sort of consensus that abstract universal commonalities in structure either aren\u2019t there, haven\u2019t been found, or can\u2019t be found. Partly the reason abstract universal commonalities in structure beyond basic psychological principles \u2018haven\u2019t been found\u2019 and \u2018can\u2019t be found\u2019 is because no attempt has been successful. That makes the conclusion that they aren\u2019t even there all the more tempting. The best attempt was by Alan Lomax, whose Cantometrics project analyzed over 4000 songs from 148 different cultural backgrounds. He defined from them 10 \u2018cultural families\u2019, and subdivided them further into two roots. He posited that essentially the world\u2019s music came down to two styles then: (1) male-dominated solos or rough unison singing, and (2) feminized, poly-voiced, regular in rhythm, repetitious. He claimed that the musical style of a culture was determined by its conditions - societies with a high repression of women had higher pitched singing than those with more gender equality, for example. Thus societal condition and musical style were abstractly linked in Lomax\u2019s opinion, and he was attempting to find through comparison the underlying structure. Despite Lomax being praised for his effort and original insights, his work has nonetheless been heavily critiqued by careful fieldwork since, showing that the principles he described do not always hold up to scrutiny. Therefore, if there are any culturally shared methods of organising sound, they are so discrete that ethnomusicologists have yet to fully uncover them. Soundly Organised Humanity Although it is hard to define culturally-shared principles of organizing sound, there is one way in which \u2018music\u2019 does share a deep common connection to culture, that is by organizing culture itself. Ritual-style gatherings of people to share a musical space has been described as a universal (Brown & Jordania, 2013). In this space, \u2018music\u2019 is not just a product of human organization, but something that then \u2018synchronizes\u2019 the people together. Even though music can be a highly individual experience, it can nonetheless help us feel a connection to those around us. Ian Cross describes this as such: \u201cMusic, as a communicative behaviour, fulfils a generic function in affording us space to rehearse and to sustain our social flexibility, permitting the expression of\u2026the human capacity for culture\u201d (2006: 9). \u2018Music\u2019 then, can be described as a universally-occurring motivator to get us together to make culture. Funnily enough, recognition of this idea goes a long way back - Confucian texts describe how it is through the combination of music with ritual that humanity finds its, well, humanity (Li Zehou, 2009). That being said, there are many functions that \u2018music\u2019 has beyond just ritual. From the individual experience of listening to \u2018music\u2019 by oneself, to the muzak playing along in a convenience store or elevator, the context music occurs in can be widely different and our reactions to that \u2018music\u2019 will similarly be widely different. Nonetheless, in each situation, the \u2018music\u2019 is doing something similar - it is creating a context upon which we can organize our emotions, behaviour, thoughts, identity, and even our morality. Conclusion Looking for commonalities across the world\u2019s music is a difficult task, so difficult that we have to start with a rocking self-doubt about the word \u2018music\u2019 itself. But even so, it is obvious that something musical happens all across the world. If we think of these events as \u2018humanly organized sound\u2019 and \u2018soundly organized humanity\u2019, as proposed by John Blacking, we can begin to unpack it a little. \u2018Humanly organized sound\u2019 may rest on our cognitive capacity, producing common themes such as limiting sonic resources into chunks such as 5\u20137 notes per scale and repeating small patterns to make larger ones. Whether there are more organizational patterns between cultures beyond these simple principles is unclear. But we can clearly also see that \u2018music\u2019 all across the world responds back to us and shapes our experience of life as an individual and member of society.

            "answer_text": "Of course, the elements of music that are common to all cultures are tones, rhythms, and forms. The tones, or notes we use are generally based on the harmonic series, and unless the music is composed with micro-tones, that\u2019s the same 12-notes that occur throughout most all cultures. I do believe that some tribal cultures have a less strict adherence to these 12 tones. As for the other two things I mentioned, rhythm is always present in all music, but it is here that we begin to vary the styles of all the cultural examples. We will notice similarities in some cultures, like modal structures that are geographical, and rhythm is equally bound to different areas. A lot of what we experience in the rhythms of different cultures have to do with dance, and that brings up the last thing I mentioned as being common to all cultures: Form. Dance is a great art form that music is married to, and within its many cultures we find more geographical types of dance, or forms. Forms include rhythm, as well. Take as a for instance the Waltz: a dance form that must be in a derivative of 3. The traditional German Waltz in 3/4 time is also similar to other cultures music in 6/8. The longer use of form in music includes things like the 4 movement, or 3 movement Sonata form. However, you find that developed in Italy, Germany, France, and eventually Russia and the United States. The Opera is the dramatic form of sung music, and it happens in many cultures, not just Italy. So, basically there are notes(tones), that are placed in forms with rhythms in every culture. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve heard the phrase \u201cmusic is a universal language\u201d many times, but I don\u2019t agree with it. Music does exist in every culture, but its stylistic features and meanings differ greatly in different cultures. Hence it would be better to call music a universal phenomenon. To my knowledge, the universal elements in music relate to celebration and ceremonial activity, where music is played collectively. Also it seems that an octave interval appears in every music tradition over the world. ",
