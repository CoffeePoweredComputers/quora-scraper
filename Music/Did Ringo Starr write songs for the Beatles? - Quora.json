            "answer_text": "Ringo is credited with two compositions recorded by the Beatles: Don\u2019t Pass Me By, a black comedy quasi Cajun/country folk song (with a bit of swing) on the White Album (1968), and the nautically themed Octopus\u2019s Garden, from Abbey Rd (1969). Ringo co-wrote What Goes On, another country track, with John and Paul, which was on side 2 of Rubber Soul (1965), and also got a co-writing credit with the other three Beatles for the psychedelic instrumental, Flying. Flying was the only instrumental the Beatles officially released during their career. It was recorded for the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack in 1968. (Pop Trivia fact: MMT was released as a double EP in the UK in 1968, but as an album by Capitol in the US. Parlophone later realised that it had mileage as an album and copied the US strategy.) Contrary to common belief, Ringo didn\u2019t write Yellow Submarine,although he sang the lead vocal. Ringo would usually average one vocal per album. Other songs sung by Ringo on Beatles recordings were Boys (an EP inclusion of a cover version of a Shirelles song written by Dixon/Farrell. I think his live Hollywood Bowl version of this is genuinely superb), Act Naturally, an awful cover of a song by Russell/Morrison included on Help! in 1965, I Wanna Be Your Man (a 1963 song written for the Stones), Matchbox (rockabilly cover song), Honey Don\u2019t (country rock cover), With A Little Help From My Friends (Lennon/McCartney song 2 on Sgt Pepper 1967), Good Night (Lennon/McCartney, counter intuitively mainly Lennon) from 1968 - White Album. Another song, If You\u2019ve Got Trouble, was written for Ringo to sing on Rubber Soul, but although recorded, it wasn\u2019t released. It was replaced by Act Naturally. In my opinion this was a strange decision because although IYGT is poor by the Beatles standards, it was an original composition. Act Naturally is awful and a cover version to boot. Lennon McCartney could therefore justifiably have insisted on the original composition being used and got the royalties. In total, Ringo sang lead vocal on 11 Beatles songs. You may be interested to know that there were 4 Beatles songs where McCartney played drums: Back In The USSR Dear Prudence Martha My Dear (Ringo had left the Beatles as he was fed up) The Ballad of John & Yoko (Both George and Ringo were on holiday) ",

Ringo\u2019s songs strike me as being childish and fluffy, judging from two of the Ringo\u2019s songs that I listened such as Yellow Submarine and Octopus Garden. ",

            "answer_text": "The Beatles either helped substantially (eg George with Octopus Garden) or would take an idea of his and rewrite for him. There is an interview with the band in 1966 in which Ringo was asked how much of What Goes on\u201d he wrote to which Ringo replied \u201cabout two lines\u201d. I think John and Paul were less precious about handing out credit where it was not due because they knew that he wasn\u2019t a threat to their carve up of each album which they felt towards George. Therefore it also ensured that he got some songwriting royalties from their albums. ",
