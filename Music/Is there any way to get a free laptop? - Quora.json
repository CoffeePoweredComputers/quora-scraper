            "answer_text": "What's a good way to get a free laptop? Get lots of friends.  Lots and lots of friends.  Become very friendly with their parents too... and their families.  Make sure your friends all know you need a laptop, and try to make sure that their parents know too.  When one of them replaces their laptop, hopefully they will remember you... and instead of just discarding or getting the old laptop recycled, they will give it to you.Get good at repairing computers.  Eventually you will get a client that would prefer to replace the unit instead of repairing it.  You'll then have a laptop you can repair and use for yourself.Get a job at a computer repair shop.  Eventually a laptop will come in to be recycled or discarded that your boss will let you keep.Are you expecting some website?  Those advertisements for a free tablet or laptop if you sign up for offers don't actually work.  I'm not saying that if you sign up you won't get the device... I'm saying that you'll be paying THROUGH THE NOSE for this free laptop, with what you end up spending on the offers you have to sign up for.  This assumes you have a credit card to be ABLE to sign up for those offers in the first place. Just because you WANT a laptop for free, doesn't automatically mean there must be a way for you to get a brand new laptop for free. However... I'm a computer repairman.  I got my first laptop for free, from a guy who had damaged the power adapter port, and had already replaced the laptop with a newer one.  He gave me the damaged one in exchange for pulling his data off it for him.  I spend $2 on a replacement power connection and a little time with my soldering iron, and I've still got that 2004 Toshiba Satellite A75.  It isn't the laptop I use... I've since gotten a better replacement for free, that was also a repair gift. EDIT:  Another way to get a free laptop, is to get a job where the company provides you with a laptop to do your job on.  You'll likely not own it, as you'd have to return it when you left the job... but you wouldn't have to pay for it while you used it. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have said, you're unlikely to get a laptops for \"free\" let alone a windows-based laptop. I'd suggest looking for scholarships or taking the odd job here and there to save up for your laptop. As others have already stated, there are many people (friends, family, extended family, etc.) that may have an old computer you can use.  Here in the U.S. we have a charity called free-geek which takes old, used computer components/computers and refurbs and distributes them to low-income families. You can also earn a computer there by doing volunteer work. You might want to look around and see if there's something similar where you are.  Also, what kind of programming are you doing? If its basic stuff than anything with 4-8 gb of RAM, a decently sized hard-drive, and an OS should serve your needs. If you're doing things like 3d modeling/rendering that's a whole different story and you're VERY unlikely to find a computer that can do that for free/very cheap. What are the specs on your computer? Is it extremely slow to the point where its unusable? A fresh re-install can help in most cases. I'm also assuming you're going to be using a Linux distro of some sort? If that's the case that may or may not make it easier to find what you're looking for. Good luck and I hope that something like a computer won't prevent you from following your dreams! ",
