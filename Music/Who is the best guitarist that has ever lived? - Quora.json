            "answer_text": "Frank Zappa. He\u2019s a far more talented composer than anyone mentioned in any response to this, and indeed would\u2019ve loved to simply compose music and conduct symphonies for the entirety of his career. Unfortunately, the music business repeatedly told him to shut up and play yer guitar. Zappa was slumming it when he played guitar instead of conducting orchestras. Due to decades of begrudging guitarring, he emerged as the greatest rock guitarist of all time, without peer, simply for the need to express his compositions via guitar instead of 100 piece symphony orchestra. Sorry anyone named Jimi or Jimmy or Steve or Stevie - Zappa\u2019s compositions are FAR superior than the sum total of your guys\u2019 output. Composition is how a great guitarist is measured - anyone can play wicked licks; it\u2019s writing said licks that separates true greatness from mere virtuosity or skill. Do yourself a favor and listen to any of the myriad live performances on YouTube - they go on forever and every one is just different enough to keep it interesting. He meticulously recorded nearly every live performance since the late 60\u2019s and turned the best individual songs into tracks on albums (he was never a big fan of the live album, there\u2019s no Zappa Comes Alive II\u2026) Anything he considered sub-par (too much audience noise, a bad mic cable here or there, etc.) is far superior to anything the above alluded to riff-masters ever blarfed out. Oh sure, those guys had some great albums, but record an entire tour and there are plenty of off nights and filler songs from even the best of the best - except Frank Zappa. The only problem with a Zappa show - ANY Zappa show - would have been a technical issue with the recording process itself (or maybe that some stupid with a flare gun burned the place to the ground). Now THAT\u2019S how you boast greatest of all time guitarist status - by actually being the best 100% of the time without peer. RIP FZ ",

            "answer_text": "To be the greatest, you have to be enduring, be as good or better than your peers at what you do, be original and effect a change in the substance of your chosen field. Dave Davies of the Kinks more or less invented the modern sound of rock guitar. So he's one of the greats and his sound has endured to this day. He's a handy guitarist without being a virtuoso performer, so he falls down as the greatest, but he's definitely one of the greats. Jimi Hendrix was the standout virtuoso guitarist of his day. He could play anyone off the park, including his own favourite Rory Gallagher. Despite the protestations of his followers, he wasn't completely original, because he built upon those who went before him. He's one of the greatest, but not the greatest. Tony Iommi single handedly invented heavy metal. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. He would be the first to admit though there were many guitarists who could outplay him at the time. Richie Blackmore for one. Eddy Van Halen made a change in the way rock guitar was played, by doing what Hendrix had already done, but faster. He is influential, but only by building on Hendrix's work. If Eddy gets the crown simply by being fast, he's already lost it to Petrucci, Vai, or Satriani. I would classify him as one of the greats though. Jimmy Page is a fine guitarist, but he came after Hendrix and Clapton and did nothing new. He's enduring and influential, but not in the way the other guys mentioned have been. Eric Clapton changed the face of rock guitar by introducing virtuosity. He isn't as technically gifted as Hendrix, but he invented the rock guitar as a virtuoso instrument. He was easily as good a player as his peers, until Hendrix came along, but he influenced Hendrix and every other rock guitarist since. He is the greatest rock guitarist in my opinion, even if he isn't the best. My list: 1 Eric Clapton 2 Jimi Hendrix 3 Dave Davies 4 Tony Iommi 5 Eddie Van Halen 6 Rory Gallagher 7 Jeff Beck 8 Chuck Berry 9 Richie Blackmore 10 Alvin Lee Honourable mentions: Jimmy Page, Duane Allman, Dave Gilmour, Brian May and Mark Knopfler Edit: I forgot to mention that my favourite guitarist isn\u2019t one I would rate as the greatest, or even on the list. That\u2019s the peerless Angus Young of AC/DC, who just rocks and to be perfectly frank, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. As a guitarist, I would love to be the best, but I know I\u2019ll never get close, so I\u2019m just happy to rock. Edit 2: I also forgot to mention: those who think Eddie VH invented tapping, just look up the name Vittorio Camardese. Edit 3: I thought I\u2019d look into tapping, because it\u2019s an important part of modern rock guitar playing and if Eddie were the first to introduce it to the rock genre, then his stock rises considerably. Here\u2019s a quote from Wikipedia: The technique began to be taken up by rock and blues players in the late 1960s. One of the earliest of such players was Canned Heat guitarist Harvey Mandel, whom Ritchie Blackmore claims to have seen using the technique onstage as early as 1968 at the Whisky a Go Go.[5]George Lynch has corroborated this, mentioning that both he and Edward Van Halen saw Mandel employ \"a neo-classic tapping thing\" at the Starwood in West Hollywood during the 1970s.[3]Mandel would utilize extensive two-handed tapping techniques on his 1973 album Shangrenade.So, there you have it. Harvey Mandel is credited as being the first to use tapping in the rock field. I\u2019m off to buy his album \u201cShangrenade\u201d. See you all later\u2026 ",
