            "answer_text": "Slash to me was impressive during GNR\u2019s early days, but in the long run he seemed to be a bit of a Jimmy Page rip off (please, no smart arse comments about \u2018Page-ripped-off-every-song\u2019; that\u2019s too passe & monotonous). Eddie van Halen was a bit more aggressive when he burst onto the scene - of course, spawning a legion of imitators (even though he was known for his ability to play Clapton solos note-for-note before widespread fame, it\u2019s recently come to my attention that a certain Page guitar solo inspired him to embark on his well-known finger tapping technique). Also, rhythmically he has a funk feel that I don\u2019t hear from Mr. Slash - not any GNR songs I\u2019ve heard, anyway (\u201cPatience\u201d is just pedestrian acoustic guitar playing). I don\u2019t feel comfortable enough to answer \u201cwho\u2019s better\u201d, but given the aforementioned song - EvH has more of an edge with his clean guitar playing - while not quite acoustic, it\u2019s the next best thing - on \u201cFinish What Ya Started\u201d. Apart from they\u2019re both different guitarists (even though I tacitly implied EvH was better). For what it\u2019s worth, Slash (Saul Hudson) was born in England to an African-American mother & an English father. He originally decided to take up the bass, but chose guitar when he heard his teacher play \u201cBrown Sugar\u201d. Eddie van Halen (Edward Lodewijk van Halen; wikipedia is inconsistent; \u201cvan\u201d with upper & lowercase), on the other hand was born to an East Indies-born (Eurasian) mother & a Dutch father some 10 years earlier in Holland. Along with his brother, he learned to play piano at age 6, before deciding to take up drums - until he realised his brother was more suited to the instrument/s. ",

            "answer_text": "Slash is a very good blues-based guitar player who wrote great riffs and solos. In the imaginary book, \u201cThe History of Rock Guitar,\u201d Slash gets a page because GNR pushed hair metal into a coffin that Nirvana nailed shut. But the 90\u2019s were not dominated by Slash wannabes. Eddie reconceived how we hear and play the instrument. An entire decade of players were measured against the yardstick Eddie created. And that hair metal sound GNR helped kill? It grew from the seeds planted by Van Halen (the band, not just the man). Eddie gets a chapter in that history book. In comparing their playing I would say that Slash was more fluid. He sticks closely to standard pentatonic scales and runs. Taken as a body of work, they\u2019re more melodic \u2014 you can hum them more easily than Eddie\u2019s. His tone is simple: Les Paul, Marshall, an occasional wah pedal. Eddie\u2019s playing is tonally much more complicated. He doesn\u2019t stick to strict pentatonic scales or runs. Dive bombs, feedback, pinched and tapped harmonics, custom/accidentally overdriven amplifier, chorus, flanger, phase\u2026 Eddie chased his \u201cBrown Sound\u201d and was more of a \u201ctone junky\u201d than Slash. There is no Cathedral or Intruder in Slash\u2019s catalog. Eddie\u2019s rhythm playing is also distinct from Slash\u2019s. Eddie is famous for playing fast solos, tapping, and tremolo picking but his rhythm playing is as distinctive. Mean Street is a great all-encompassing example: That intro is pure Eddie. No one else plays like that. Note that this is actually a pretty bluesy intro.From about 29 seconds in we get a feel for the rhythm he\u2019s playing. It has a funk feel that has Eddie written all over it.Eddie played both rhythm and lead. So he\u2019s got to carry the main riff throughout the song. But when he\u2019s not playing that riff, he\u2019s quite happy leaving spaces between the notes. Or playing one chord/tone and letting it hang. He\u2019s not racing anywhere.From 2:10 with the bridge, we hear a lot of these pieces come together: a bit of space, bit of a funk rhythm. We hear the Brown Sound.2:27 \u2014 a punch in from Eddie\u2026 oops.2:29 to 2:42 is a 13 second solo that says all it needs to, ending with a \u201cbroken\u201d blues scale that settles on a vibrato blue note.3:20 simple volume swells \u2014 this is the \u201cspoken word\u201d portion of the song. Eddie does not need to be playing all the time.3:50 - he\u2019s complementing the bass guitar and also carrying a bit of the melody.4:05 - outro solo where he\u2019s bending into a tone.It\u2019s clean, concise, a bit dynamically diverse. You might even listen to this isolated track and think, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t sound that hard\u201d because it\u2019s not even fast. Slash\u2019s solo in Paradise City is much faster. But it sounds easy because he\u2019s that good.  Take another example: Spanish Fly. Eddie loved the sound of flamenco guitar but didn\u2019t know how to play that style. So he composed a version of it. In concert he performs a partial, electric version in a montage with a bunch of other bits. So I\u2019m linking to this cover by Rick Graham. Slash doesn\u2019t play anything like this (I\u2019m sure he can learn it) and I haven\u2019t heard any composition that is that far away from his blues guitar style.  By now I\u2019m sure it\u2019s clear that I\u2019m a Van Halen fan over Slash. But Slash is still a great player. He\u2019s just more limited. And as much as he just isn\u2019t as \u201cout there\u201d as Eddie, his solos were often much more composed and fluid. I am sure Eddie could play those tracks, but he didn\u2019t compose anything like Fall to Pieces. fall to pieces - Bing video ",
