            "answer_text": "Jefferson Airplane which I am certain most of you have heard of if not familiar with, is a band formed back in 1965. the original lineup was Marty Balin, Paul Kanter, Jorma Kaukonen, Jerry Peloquin, Bob Harvey and with Signe Toly Anderson as the lead singer.  Grace Slick , everyone is familiar with and ties to the band joined the band a year later after the departure of Toly/Anderson. Ok, the band name. Ok, there is a wee bit of dispute about how the name Jefferson Airplane came to be. The most popular theory is that it was a reference to Blind Lemon Jefferson a good friend of Marty Balin\u2019s. A made up name Blind Thomas Jefferson Airplane was thought to have been a joke of some sort on Blind lemon Jefferson, but the real answer still remains unconfirmed by the band leaving speculation by fans. Another theory is that it is a reference to a match stick used as a marijuana joint holder so the smoker would not burn their fingers \u201c a jefferson airplane\u201d but as I have said, no real confirmation as to which story if either is how the band name came to be. Yet another tale is that Jorma Kaukonen was being called Blind Lemon Jefferson in jest, came up with the name based on his knickname and that of his dog.This was apparently quoted by Kaukonen but as myself, I was not there I cannot truly say. So, I say take your pick, choose the answer you feel is best and carry on. ",

            "answer_text": "In the days that pot was usually rolled into a joint for smoking, the stub, called a roach, was put into a \u2018roach clip' to prevent burning one's fingers. A popular way to fashion a clip was to take a paper book match, and use your thumbnail to split the paper of the burnt match in two. The roach was captured between the two halves and the burned head held the two halves together. The roach and match clip was known as a Jefferson Airplane. ( I don't know where the Jefferson part came from.) The band adopted the name for the connection to the homemade roach clip.   ",
