            "answer_text": "Kinda like YES or NO\u2026..It depends\u2026.Likewise BTS and Blackpink have lots of fans in Korea as well as internationally\u2026.Kpop literally became famous because of BTS and then afterwards Blackpink. 4\u20135 years ago most of us didn't exactly know what Kpop was until it started gaining popularity from the beginning of 2017 and onwards\u2026.I mean this trend was officially introduced by BTS and Blackpink but this does not means that the trend will eventually die as soon as both the bands gets retirement\u2026For example I started with BTS and then started gaining interest in other K-pop bands like Ateez  ITZY  TXT  STRAY KIDS  Seventeen  . . . These bands are still new and some even debuted an Year ago\u2026This means that they will not retire sooner and will exist even after the retirement of either BTS and Blackpink\u2026So I guess we will keep supporting these bands and so Kpop will still continue\u2026..Though both BTS and Blackpink have introduced Kpop to us but trend has been started and in my opinion it will still continue\u2026Maybe our kids (our next generation) might be a fan of their kids (our idol\u2019s children)\u2026who knows?!! right?\u2026Maybe our kids might be a fan of a band consisting of BTS\u2019s children\u2026. . . . until now all we can do is wait\u2026.
