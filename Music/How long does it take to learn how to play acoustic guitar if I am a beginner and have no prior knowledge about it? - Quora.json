            "answer_text": "It takes a lifetime. Any song is playable at various levels of adequacy. If you\u2019ve only started out playing, you will play songs with chords only. Gradually you will learn strumming patterns, fingerpicking or flatpicking that make it more interesting. You see, playing the guitar is a skill that doesn\u2019t end where you need or want it to. There is always room for improvement, a way to spice things up even after you\u2019re completely sure a song you are playing is good as it is. Now, back to the question: The answer depends on your goal and at what point you consider yourself a successful guitar player. If your goal is to play along in a band, as rhythm guitarist, your primary goal should be learning all of your chords and rhythm patterns with your strumming hand. If you plan to play by yourself, to accompany your singing, learning some music theory will greatly help you understand music to make your own. So set a goal, and find out what you need to achieve this goal. Whatever your goal is, it is crucial to practice every day. Why? Because when you want to convince your brain that learning new motor skills is of any importance at all, it needs daily comfirmation. If you skip some days regularly, your memory decides \u2018meh, let\u2019s ditch these connections\u2019 and steadily you start forgetting things you\u2019ve learned. Wouldn\u2019t that be a waste of time? Definitely. So make it worth your time and practice every day. Don\u2019t go overboard by practicing hours on end right away. It is more effective to practice thoughtfully, having your focus at 100%. Actively think about what you are doing rather than to go on auto pilot and just moving your fingers. Vary your practice routine with different kinds of techniques. Don\u2019t practice the same thing over and over until you feel brain dead. If you start feeling tired or bored, take a break, do something relaxing, and come back when you feel excited again. You will see that in a year time you will have progressed more than you thought you would, and the hunger for more will never end. Take Tommy Emmanuel as an example. This guy has been playing for more than 55 years, he\u2019s still discovering new techniques! ",

            "answer_text": "From the day you started learning to the day you agree that you have learnt enough. It all depends on the level of mastery that satisfies you or your intention/passion towards music, for eg: one can learn few simple chords in a week and sing 1 or 2 song just to showoff, while on other hand there is plethora of variations that one can carry out with simple acoustic guitar. Acoustic guitarists can be categorized into infinite sects: One who learns the basics of music whether it be chord progression,various scales, western octaves, classical notes, various harmonics etc Or One who just listens & experiments with the instrument like a curious kid who may even invent another type of acoustic guitar with a bit of variation Or One who simply surfs internet or looks into song books, knows some chords, sings fine, & generally values Rhythm more than lead notes also known as Rhythm guitarist (Rhythmic style often needs a lead instrument or vocalist to accompany) Or One who practices various techniques such as finger-picking, palm muting, tapping, two handed tapping etc. He/she often mixes these techniques with rhythm Or One who carries out variations on various strings through techniques such as hammer ons, pull off, guitar bends, sweep picking, cross picking, hybrid picking, slide ons etc Or One who limits himself to certain style of music such as Jazz, country, centric folk, ragtime, blues, carribean, flamenco(spanish) etc. Or One who feels music as a form of expression and forms his or her own music whether through variation in notes or chords and this same person may fall in any or all of the above categories as well. I categorized them randomly at one go and the list can just go on and on. In a nutshell I would suggest you to have a particular goal and remain consistent/adamant/dedicated to take out some time on daily basis and make yourself uncomfortable to reach that goal. If possible have an Idol for inspiration, have a dream, explore the world of music through internet/books. You will surely bear the fruits of your hard work and attain the level of mastery you desire. However, there would still be lots of untouched water in the vast ocean of music. My answer would have been even longer if I would have given beautiful examples of these categories, though leaving you with a phrase from one of the acoustic masterpeice: 'All you touch and all you see is all you will ever be'.
