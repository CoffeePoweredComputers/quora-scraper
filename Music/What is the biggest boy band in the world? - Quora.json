            "answer_text": "The biggest boybands have been The Beatles and One Direction\u2026 But obviously as if we see today \u2018BTS\u2019 is considered as one of the biggest boybands and that they have become so popular not only in Korea but also worldwide. Recently they were nominated in the MTV music awards for the very first time in 4 categories and they won all them. Also their new comeback single Dynamite broke the records. Now its very obvious that some people unstan and hate BTS but you can't deny the fact they are getting extremely popular. Also some people say that are just men who put makeup and are talentless.. But there many kpop groups other than BTS.. Which are also very good.. But there must have been something different or unique which had made their way worldwide.. I am Army but also i respect every boyband. ",
