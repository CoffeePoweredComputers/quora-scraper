            "answer_text": "Most of the people consider Eminem to be a homophobic white guy, who only knows how to diss, curse and put down others. But what many people do not know are the struggles of Eminem\u2019s earlier days. Though personally even I feel his music isn't what it used to be near 2005 or so but still there are quite a few tracks which will prove to you that he is lyrically the far best, one of the greatest storytellers and some of his songs will make you literally cry. Like Toy Soldiers: \u201cLike Toy Soldiers\" tells the story of Eminem's attempts to calm a violent community of rappers. Eminem speaks openly about problems with The Source magazine and its editor Benzino, as well as the situation between 50 Cent and Ja Rule and his label Murder Inc., which Eminem felt went far beyond the Jay-Z vs. Nas feudWhen I\u2019m Gone: This one is surely gonna make you cry. This song shows Halie\u2019s side of how she feels about her dad going to tours constantly and neglecting her and Kim. It has got a real emotional side to it and is one of my personal favourites.You\u2019re Never Over: This song\u2019s a tribute to his best friend Proof who was killed by gunshot wounds. Eminem and Proof were very close friends so this song undoubtedly shows his respect for the fellow rapper and how he will be missed by the whole hip hop community.Stan/Bad Guy: This song is a lyrical masterpiece which showcases Eminem\u2019s storytelling at its best. Stan which was part of MMLP feat Dido claimed many accolades and the second part of the series Bad guy delivers nothing less. Eminem picks off from where he left at Stan, this time rapping from the side of Stan\u2019s younger brother Matthew Mitchell and his plot to kill Eminem. The whole story goes in one smooth flow and is written brilliantly. The last para is my favoriteMockingbird: Another heart-warming song which shows Eminem\u2019s emotional side. This track addresses Eminem's relationship with his daughter Hailie Jade, his adopted daughter Alaina and his relationship with his wife Kim.Role Model: Probably one of the most funniest Eminem songs I have come across, Eminem shows off his not so ideal role model characteristics with a tinge of lyrical insanityBiterphobia: This is one of the lesser known of Eminem pf the time before he was famous. With a humongous vocabulary and turntables scratching, this is one song which proves why Eminem is going to be one of the best rappers in the future.Despicable (Freestyle): Released as a counter song to Drake\u2019s \u2018Over\u2019, this freestyle can be considered as good as Eminem\u2019s freestyle with Tim Westwood.Infinite: Last but not the least, one of the first tracks that showcased Eminem in mainstream Hip hop, at first you may not like this song as it doesn't posses the charm and lyrical intricacy of his current tracks, but listen to it twice or thrice and you will not be able to stop listening to it. This is Pure Ol\u2019 School Eminem hip hop.Upvote if you guys agree with the list. ",
