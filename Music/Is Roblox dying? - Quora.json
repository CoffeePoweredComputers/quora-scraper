            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026 and No. Reason? ROBLOX is growing at a very insane rate. They also hit 1 BILLION USERS in late January 2019. This rate will no doubt keep growing and keep ROBLOX on the top of the multiplayer games. Also forgot to mention but ROBLOX has a steadily declining monthly online players, and that\u2019s my reason yes. Edit 1: This question is pretty irrelevant now because ROBLOX is the second biggest game in the world currently. Edit 2: VERY irrelevant, the game Adopt Me just nearly reached 2m online players, way bigger than the likes of CS:GO and TF2 ",

            "answer_text": "I strongly doubt it. Here\u2019s a good, and publicly available, leading indicator of whether or not a company is shutting down: employee count. Why? Because when times are tough, the very first thing you\u2019re likely to cull is marketing spend, and then beyond that, it\u2019s superfluous employees, eventually going beyond that into the less-superfluous employees. The first isn\u2019t captured by FTE declines, but the latter two surely are. Where captures FTE numbers better than anywhere else? LinkedIn. So this is a good first place to look. If Roblox is really shutting down, you\u2019d expect some lay-offs in recent months\u2026  Nope. Looks fine to me :-) ",
