            "answer_text": "I no longer concern myself much with genre names. For some time now the proliferation of genre names has made it for all practical purposes impossible to keep up. I sort my music into the following: AlternativeBreakbeatClassicalElectronicFolkIDMJazzMetalPopRockEverything I listen to fits into these somewhere. Alternative covers Punk, Goth, Grunge, Industrial, Shoegaze, etc. Electronic music is broken into 3: breakbeat, electronic, and IDM because not breaking it up at least a little is like lumping alternative, rock, and pop, all under rock. It gets a little unwieldy. All the weird stuff goes into IDM, all the funk/breaks style stuff goes in breakbeat, and literally everything else goes in electronic. I\u2019ve resisted breaking it up further because the more genres I use the more difficult it is to know where I will find anything. Sure, I can search, but something I like about browsing is I may think I want to listen to one thing but as I glance over what else is in the selected genre I may think \u201cwait, why not that instead?\u201d This is especially useful for genres that are still relatively new to me like Classical and Jazz where I may not immediately think of an artist by name. But almost as useful for genres I\u2019ve listened to for a long time where maybe I haven\u2019t listened to a band in a while and they don\u2019t always come to mind when thinking of what I want to hear and then when I see the name it sparks my desire. (I also have a tiny amount of Hip-Hop which gets it\u2019s own folder but I have so little I often think of collapsing it into one of the others.) To address the second part of the question: Rap is a small portion of modern music. It\u2019s existence or lack thereof probably has little to no effect on what new styles will be called as its influence isn\u2019t that significant that any new style is defined in terms of its relation to rap..

            "answer_text": "Those are mighty bold assumptions, Rap can be traced back to 80's Hip Hop so you can imagine that most people don't take it too lightly. The direction US society seems to be going suggest that it could be called anything. We have artists that release nonsense and openly admit to it-it's because people think that it's all about the money, fast cars, jewelry..etc. The most successful Rap artists to date were the ones that loved what they did for what it was. Rap music seems to have become over-saturated and as a result the quality is degrading, but I don't see any reason to believe it's going to disappear anytime soon. ",
