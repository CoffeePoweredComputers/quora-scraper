They would think his farting on stage during a performance was disgusting and crude.  Elvis here is demonstrating his prowess at karate and his butt tooting skills. The Beatles would be even more repelled by Elvis\u2019 new image of lack of professionalism than The Rolling Stones. Because back when Elvis wasn\u2019t tooting on stage back in the fifties, the Beatles idolized him, but they didn\u2019t anymore after he died and then slightly before that as well. ",
