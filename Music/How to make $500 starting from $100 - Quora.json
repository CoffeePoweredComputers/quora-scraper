            "answer_text": "I like Thomas's answer...you need to provide a service to get that type of return off of $100. You don't need a talent necessarily - if you read one in-depth article on say Facebook ads - you are probably ahead of 95% of people out there on the topic. You can then turnaround and search for people that would benefit from running Facebook ads and pitch them on your services. Another example, lets say its a local business that doesn't have placement on Google search...you could offer to setup their listing, optimize it for views on search and do all their SEO work. Point is -- find a problem people have (or don't know they have yet), take a solution to them and get paid. ",
