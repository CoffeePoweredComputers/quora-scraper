            "answer_text": "Okay, I am going to share a funny story. I am sure many have heard the song by War called \u201cwhy can\u2019t we be friends.\u201d Probably one of the catchiest songs with a reggae like beat in the 70\u2019s. I couldn\u2019t understand the lyrics and thought they were singing \u201cmake it spic and span.\u201d To my younger readers, spic and span was a popular floor cleaner at the time. I guess I saw enough commercials for it back then. For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t figure out why they would be making such a catchy tune about a floor cleaner. Then again, I was about maybe 7 at the time too. LOL My parents finally corrected me that it was \u201cwhy can\u2019t we be friends.\u201d Now this jogged my memory a little. Back when I was in school, we did have some occasional gospel songs in music class. One was \u201cJoshua fought the battle of Jericho.\u201d At the time, that melody was used in a commerical for Geritol. Again, to my younger readers, Geritol was a vitamin that was targeted at seniors. So, we would be singing this song along with the record and have to be reminded that it was \u201cJericho\u201d and we were not singing about Geritol. I thought it sounded like the record was saying \u201cJoshua fought the battle of Geritol and the walls came tumbling down.\u201d Oh my, I can still hear the teacher say, \u201cwe aren\u2019t singing about Geritol.\u201d The first example, you never had a commercial made with that melody. Maybe that was a lost chance at a jingle now that I think of it. Or maybe I saw too much TV back then. LOL Who knows. Questions like this can be fun jogging the memory. ",

Here were what the actual lyrics were: \u201cThey wanna get my Gold on the ceiling I ain\u2019t blind it\u2019s just a matter of time\u201d yadda yadda I thought that the singer said that they were gonna get their \u201crolls on the ceiling\u201d as in the food. I didn\u2019t question it whatsoever. Who wouldn\u2019t want to steal someone\u2019s rolls? Then, I thought, hm maybe these aren\u2019t the lyrics\u2026, and I came up with another wrong version. Instead, the singer sung about how they were going to roll around on the ceiling. A pretty funny visual if you ask me. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was much younger, I couldn\u2019t get enough of the great music coming out of the sixties. So many artists were pushing the boundaries and breaking the norms that we were hearing things that seemed so fresh and new. One of those artists was Jimi Hendrix. His guitar work just felt so amazing and mind-bending, but he was also poetic in his lyrics. He did a song in 1967 called \u201cPurple Haze\u201d and I loved singing along with it and playing air guitar. I always felt a bit awkward and puzzled at the fourth line of the song when I sang along to \u201cExcuse me while I kiss this guy.\u201d It just wasn\u2019t something you heard in pop music, but it was Hendrix, and he was known to be into mind-altering drugs, so I just blew it off and sang along with it anyway. It turned out his actual lyric was \u201cExcuse me while I kiss \u2014- the sky.\u201d I didn\u2019t find that out until many years later. ",
