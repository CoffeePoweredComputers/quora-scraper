            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a great question. I watch a lot of American cable news. Mainly CNN & FOX which illustrate the divisions in the USA. They are entirely different and not for the news content but in the way it\u2019s presented. As a Brit I find CNN more akin to the BBC. It\u2019s calm, collected and quiet. The Anchors speak quietly and with conviction. Anderson Cooper is a superb interviewer. He very rarely shows any emotion. He\u2019s professional. And so to\u2026. FOX NEWS. Where can I start? This is infested with archytipal stereotypical Americans as expected here in Britain. The anchors all speak at breakneck speed and very loudly. The constantly smirk. Just watch WAtters world and view his sarcastic grinning clowns face. Sean Hannity never draws breath, constantly shouts at his \u201cGuests\u201d. You never hear their answers. He just shouts and abuses them then cuts them off. On to our Female Abchors. Very shrill nasal voices projected at speed. Really quite unpleasant. So, in essence, it seems that the Democrats are somewhat acceptable whereas republicans? Not to my tastes. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on who the American is they sound like characters from a movie. On a recent cruise I met three families from Chicago, who had accents like stereotypical gangsters from Goodfellas. When I mimicked their accent they thought it was hilarious, because of course I\u2019d use the stereotypical language of movie gangsters; however, I can\u2019t do a Joe Pesci, his accent is too high for me. I also met a family from Now York, The father was a retired history lecturer. We had a great discussion about politics. I have also spoken to Americans from Southern states, and what gracious people they are enquiring about your family and well-being, with that southern drawl. Fantastic. However, I have spoke to a few American women who sounded nasally when they spoke, but never-the-less they were very charming. ",
