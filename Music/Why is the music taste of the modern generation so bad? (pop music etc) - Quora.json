            "answer_text": "I'm only 23 but I see where you are coming from, especially when it comes to hip hop. from lonzo ball saying Nas isn't hip hop to some dude named little xan saying he's better than 2pac without having the desire to improve his lyrical skills so his words will one day be true. As a rapper myself, I think I'm the greatest rapper of all time. but unlike zo and xan, I am well aware of the need to work on my writing,freestyle,and producing skills. I don't care if people born from 96' to the present like my music. the legends were on their way out and a wave of keeping it fake took over the music industry. I'll be straight up with you: American hip hop is trash compared with the mid 80's \u2014 mid 90's era. when I first got into hip hop as a kid, I bought old school hip hop albums like the chronic and at the speed of life. again, I don't care if people born from 96' onwards like my music. I care if people born from 74' to \u201994 like my music. why? cause they know what real hip hop is. Lastly,if 96' onwards people like my music,cool. but i only care about the opinions of people who grew up in the golden age of hip hop. ",

            "answer_text": "People won't like my answer because I'm over opinionated and almost 40. I'll admit I'm biased when it comes to certain genres of music. Today's pop, hip-hop, indie folk crap, and country\u2026they all f-ing suck! When an artist relies to heavily on auto-tune and pitch correction software they have no real talent. I want to hear the artist's real voice, not some gay ass sounding robot. These people shouldn't quit their day job. People have told me if you could do better become a singer\u2026not wasting my time because it's not my talent\u2026I don't enjoy it. I know what music I like. I'm a hater\u2026I'll admit it. When Tim McGraw was asked in an interview if he has used auto-tune he said yes he had and was proud of it. I lost a lot respect for him. It just seems like a lot of modern pop and rap\u2026I mean crap\u2026artists overuse auto-tune to the point it's super annoying. If you hadn't already gathered I'm mostly a fan of rock music. Hard rock, classic rock, grunge, alternative, punk, metal\u2026blah blah blah. Favorite era of music\u20261980s and 1990s. So yes in my humble opionion\u2026anyone who likes most modern pop and hip-hop\u2026uuggg\u2026and country are dumb and stupid. So there\u2026stick it! ",
