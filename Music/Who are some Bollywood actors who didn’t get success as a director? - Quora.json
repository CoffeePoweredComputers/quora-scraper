            "answer_text": "1. Deepak Tijori directed - Oops(2003) Deepak Tijori has done some impressive works but is often remembered as the sidekick in the movies. A little later in his life, he decided to switch his career and directed the movie Oops.  The movie was about two male strippers and their life around the city. The movie tanked at the box office and Deepak said he over sexualized the film with too many appealing scenes.  2. Rishi Kapoor directed - Aa Ab Laut Chalen(1999)  Rishi Kapoor tried his luck with the director\u2019s chair. He directed the movie Aa Ab Laut Chalen with the star cast of Rajesh Khanna, Akshaye Khanna, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.  The movie didn\u2019t perform well at the box office and critics bashed the movie saying there\u2019s nothing new but the movie is loved by the audience. 3. Hema Malini directed - Dil Aashna Hai(1992)   Her ambitious project was Dil Aashna Hai starring Shah Rukh Khan and some other big names from the industry.  It was supposed to be the debut movie of Shah Rukh Khan but Deewana released first because of the shooting delays of the movie Dil Aashna Hai. Well, it is the only movie that Hema Malini directed and she failed. 4. Pankaj Kapur directed - Mausam(2011)  Pankaj Kapur has established himself as a great actor in the industry. Pankaj Kapur has directed his most ambitious Project Mausam with Shahid Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor in the lead role.  First, the movie took years to wrap the shooting schedule, and it failed miserably at the box office. Even actors of the movie confessed that the movie was lengthy to shoot. 5. Ajay Devgn directed - U Me Aur Hum(2008)  Ajay Devgn also sat on the director\u2019s chair not once but twice. First, he directed the movie U Me Aur Hum which was the rip off version of Hollywood blockbuster The Notebook.  The movie failed to impress the audience. Later he directed the movie Shivaay which received a mixed response. Some critics have said that Ajay should only work in front of the camera and technical work should be left for others. 6. Anupam Kher directed - Om Jai Jagdish(2002)  Anupam Kher directed the movie Om Jai Jagdish starring Anil Kapoor, Fardeen Khan, and Abhishek Bachchan.  One interesting trivia about the movie is that the film was supposed to be made under the Yashraj banner with the lead of Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan playing lead roles.  Sadly actors refused to do the film because of their date issues, and the movie was produced by Vasu Bhagnani. The movie tanked at the box office and Anupam Kher never directed any movie again. 7. Shashi Kapoor directed - Ajooba(1991)  Shashi Kapoor also follows the family tradition and sat on the director\u2019s chair for the movie Ajooba. The movie was a fantasy fiction with Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor in the lead role. Amitabh Bachchan did the movie as a friendly gesture.  The movie tanked at the box office and makers covered the loss by selling the satellite rights of the movie. While the movie failed and everyone criticized Shashi Kapoor, he got full marks for his efforts with such concepts in Indian cinema. 8. Sunny Deol directed - Dillagi and Ghayal Once Again  Sunny Deol is one of the best actors of his time and has been part of many great movies. Sunny Deol also tried to impress the audience with his directing skills and directed the movie Dillagi which was a big flop.  After many years, he directed the sequel of Ghayal but the movie failed at the box office again. Source - Google Images ",
