            "answer_text": "You didn't say which end is unwinding so we will look at both ends. This is how I string up my guitar. If you take notice in this picture, the E A and D strings are secured with just a half hitch. Look at where the free end of the string is: it is locked behind the bridge and each subsequent string is locked into the adjacent knot. These wound strings lock relatively easy. The G and B strings use two loops and the e string uses 3, but the trick is locking the string behind the bridge, it needs to bind against something. I also lock the adjacent strings like the wound strings.  On the tuning pegs I like to have as few turns as possible. I don't want to have any slack captured in winds around the tuning peg. On the wound strings you take the free end and put it through the peg and pull the string so there isn't any slack. Pull the free end towards the top of the headstock and then wrap it around the string where it goes through the peg. Take the free end and pull it back through the peg slot to the back. It should look like the string going through the peg and the free end making a U turn around the string. Now you start tightening the tuning peg\u2026 et Voila, the string is locked and cannot come loose. Proceed to bring the string up to pitch\u2026 wind the string towards the outside to keep it as straight as possible. You will probably still get 2 or 3 turns around the peg as the string comes up to pitch. Once it is up to pitch, cut off the excess string. Use this method for the E A D G and B strings, the high e we will do a bit differently. The high e is more prone to slippage, so we need to use a different locking method. Pull the slack out of the string and pull it over the tuning peg, from the backside, thread the string through the peg hole towards the front of the guitar, go around the string and back into the hole from the same side. Now here is the trick that keeps the string locked up tight: bring the free end back around to the front and go through the same loop. It will look something like this (note-this string has already been trimmed, I put some slack on it so you can see what it should look like before bringing it up to pitch):  Once you have the string slack removed, start bringing it up to pitch. Then it will look like this:  The string is doubly locked on itself and it should stay in tune (provided your tuners have the correct amount of stiffness). The finished headstock should look something like this:  Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You are actually referring to the high (as in unwound, plain, treble) E-string and not the low, bass, wound one? Some people incorrectly says high E about the wound bass because it\u2019s the one closest to them.. In any case, if it\u2019s the bass, you may see the winding coming loose when the string is worn. You need to change the three basses if this is the case. If you\u2019re talking about the treble, plain E-string, there can be two things going on. You either have a new string that haven\u2019t settled in yet or the string is slipping at the bridge or the tuning peg. The plain, treble strings take a long time to settle in and will require a lot of tuning up before they stay in tune. This is the reason concert players never, ever change treble strings right before a performance. If the strings haven\u2019t been properly tied around the bridge or fastened at the tuning peg post, the string may actually slip. There are many videos on YouTube on how to properly do this to avoid the issue of a plain treble string slipping. It is possible but extremely rare and highly unlikely that there\u2019s a problem with the tuning peg itself. That said, have it checked for loose screws or worn gears. If you look at he outside of the tuning pegs, you will see a screw that connects the small gear (\u2018wheel\u2019) to the tuning post. If this screw (it\u2019s usually black) is coming loose, you may have worn gears or not enough grip, making the string slip. Just take a small screwdriver and tighten these screws from time to time. And as always, let someone with enough experience look at things for you if you\u2019re at all uncertain! ",
