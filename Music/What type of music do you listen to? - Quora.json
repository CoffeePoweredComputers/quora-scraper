            "answer_text": "I listen to whatever sounds good to me to be entirely honest but for the most part it consists of these: Kpop- I only really listen to BTS because unlike other groups I like ALL of their songs (also just for the record, they are a hip hop idol group because their songs have a more hip hop and r&b feel to it rather than pop). I do also like Blackpink but I'm not a fan of ALL of their songs (and they only have like 5 released yet\u2026 stupid YG) and I more so prefer their performances of their songs as a whole rather than just the music itself. Same applies to GFriend who I occasionally listen to but some of their songs can get on the annoying side for my preference and the same applies to pretty much every single girl group out there with cute concepts. However, there are some genuinely good songs that aren't by some group or artist that I specifically stan. For example, IU, Ailee, Taeyang, G-Dragon, and other artists have some songs that I'll put on my playlist but it doesn't necessarily apply to all of their songs.Country-I do enjoy listening to Carrie Underwood, Kelsea Ballerini and occasionally some of Taylor Swifts older songs before she switched to pop (if only she could come back to country just once\u2026) and I do like Lucy Hale's album \u201cRoad Between\u201d. But it varies from several artists.Alternative Rock- I mostly listen to Fall Out Boy not the loud and obnoxious electric guitar and drums type of rock.Western Pop- It gets annoying when people say pop music isn't real music because it dominates the American music industry so there obviously has to be something good about it. Don't get me wrong, just like every other genre, there are some good songs as well as bad ones. The artists I listen to are Beyonc\u00e9, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston (R.I.P), Christina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson, Adele, Alessia Cara and Little Mix, at least for the most part but like I said it varies from several artists because I just listen to whatever my ears like. But I guess the reason people say pop music is bad is because of the certain music certain artists make whom I will not name because I don't want their passionate fans attacking me.Rap- Idk if it even counts as it's own genre but I'll just do it anyway. For the most part I listen to NF but he's very religious and writes about God sometimes so I don't listen to EVERY SINGLE song because I'm an atheist but its fantastic and deep music and honestly he's so underrated. There are a lot of other rappers that sing about nonsense like sex and drugs which is quite frankly, annoying and takes away my faith in humanity so I don't even bother listening to any of that. Also, I can't be a true A.R.M.Y. without mentioning Agust D/Suga, Rap Monster and JHope: some of my all time favorite songs are theirs and seriously words cannot describe how much I love them and their music.So yah it varies quite a bit. Also, to anyone reading this: if you tease or make fun of anyone for their taste in music or anything for that matter, shame on you. I used to be embarrassed for liking BTS because my \u201cfriends\u201d told me it was weird for being in a different language and was told Little Mix's songs were \u201ctoo poppy\u201d: overall just respect other people's choices. If you dont like a song someone else likes make fun of them in your head you don't have to say it out loud (unless they're mean and obnoxious hyprocrites who need to be told off) ",

            "answer_text": "I listen to many types of music, though I guess I'd have to say that I grew up on rock-'n'-roll. Music was always in my home as a child, as my parents met because they sang in each other's church choir. They were also fond of show tunes and when very young, I was exposed to the likes of Rogers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter, the Gershwins, etc., as well as classical and gospel music. I was in the fourth grade when the Beatles hit the airwaves, by which time I'd already begun to listen to Elvis, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis and suchlike, though this was done in a circumspect manner due to the fact that Dad and Mom did not approve. Country music was also frowned upon, being described as \u201cthat crying in your beer crap\u201d. As I entered puberty and adolescence, I had one of those newfangled transistor pocket radios and remember many nights listening to such as the Rolling Stones, Eric Burdon & the Animals, The Who, more Beatles and many others; with that tinny sounding earplug, often into the wee hours. I went to my first rock concert at about fourteen, the Thirteeth Floor Elevators at a local municipal gym (to those that know, this reveals me as a Texan). Two weeks later at the same venue I saw Fever Tree. I was wowed by the power of the beat and the light shows. Leaving home at sixteen to escape Dad's drinking, I was exposed to lots more rock and became an ardent fan of Dylan and other folk and folk-rock artists. Dylan's duet with Johnny Cash on Nashville Skyline revealed the beauty of the country sound to me, though it was much later in life that I began to listen to much more country and roots rock styled music. In the late sixties and early seventies I lived through acid rock and psychedelia, Hendrix being especially influential, then gained a greater appreciation for the blues and jazz. Hendrix, after all, was first and foremost a bluesman. I was never a fan of disco when that became the rage, often saying that it made me want to 'dis go away'. I learned to love electronica though such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, a decade or so after first hearing Switched on Bach. Now, halfway through my seventh decade, my music collection is quite diverse, although there are a couple of glaring omissions. I am not particularly fond of thrash, hard metal, hip-hop or rap. I have gained a fondness for country singer-songwriters but I'm not particularly impressed by mainstream country pop. My favorite band of the last fifteen years is Wilco, hands down. Jeff Tweedy's lyrics have seen me through some rough times, including the passing of my wife of a quarter of a century. I highly value the experience of over half a century of watching and listening to musical evolution through the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Though there may be a few genres of which I am not a fan, I nonetheless recognize the importance of all in this human culture. Life without music would be a far bleaker thing. ",

            "answer_text": "I usually like to listen to R&B because of its atmospheric feels and the usage of melisma in it that just never ceases to amaze me. Another thing to like about R&B is its lyricism since they talk about issues that are present in the society that ranges from the government to the music industry and then to love that is not that evident in mainstream music. The usual type of R&B I listen to is the one that infuses trap or instruments in a band since I really love the implemention of bass in music. The thing about great masterpieces and artists in the genre is that most of them are underrated, although I usually like music that are underrated due to the fact that they are not overplayed. I really would like the genre to be recognized and appreciated by more people since they produce content that are usually missed by people since they are being advertised with these mainstream music that have the conplacent content that are very overplayed. This is why I suggest that we should try to explore more and delve into the lyrics rather than just enjoying the beat. I would also like to say that any genre suits me since I am open to different sounds but R&B has an edge to me since I am addicted to what it has to offer. I\u2019ll leave you with a list of songs if you want to explore good R&B music that has lyricism.

            "answer_text": "I tend to listen to the same things over and over. There are two main types of music I listen to, and a few others that I pull up occasionally. I mainly listen to music in the car. I much prefer to hear the ambient sounds of the neighborhood, at home. And I can't stand earbuds or headphones, so no music at work or while working out. My main jams: Leonard Cohen - I have several playlists and between them, pretty sure I have every song. My preference is the live recordings of concerts, but I have all the albums, too. And I sing along. I recently figured out that for my next life I will be a backup singer for the person who was Leonard Cohen in this life. So might as well start practicing! Kundalini yoga mantras - these are Sikh mantras (written language of the mantras is Gurmukhi, the words are Gurbani), with contemporary music - kind of new age/folk style. For an example, look up Snatam Kaur or the group White Sun. I love both of these because they have complexity - every listening (or singing) is a new experience. And occasionally I throw in jazz (everything from Coltrane to Nina Simone) or classical (Bach is a favorite right now, but again, I listen to everything). When asked my favorite piece of music: Luciano Berio\u2019s Sinfonia, especially the third movement. When I was a music student, I got my hands on the score and spent many glorious evenings sprawled on the floor following along with the recording. ",

            "answer_text": "I listen to a very wide variety but there are 3 genres that take the majority of my listening. Rock - I tend to listen to a lot of rock. Ranging from Queen to Fall out boy. A lot of Bastille and Panic! at The Disco. FUN. and Cartel also make it into that category. Rap/Hip-Hop - I listen to a lot of Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Travis Scott (occasionally), J. Cole, blackbear, Blockboy JB, Miguel, and lots of twenty one pilots (which is really hard to assign a genre but since he raps in most of the songs and it uses hip hops major style I\u2019m putting it here.) R&B - R&B is my favorite genre by far and most of my taste in other genre\u2019s actually spawns from R&B. I love Khalid. He\u2019s my boy right now. Other artists though include Post Malone, Jacquees, Charlie Puth, Bruno Mars, Frank Ocean and Childish Gambino. So I think the answer is I listen to a wide variety but everything kind of flows out from R&B. My taste in rock is more melodic and follows the R&B rhythm, my taste in rap is less hardcore and I prefer songs with a pretty melody in the chorus, and then there\u2019s a lot of R&B specifically.

By that I mean Mozart, Debussy, Holst, Mussorgsky, Dukas, Vivaldi, Franck, Ravel, etc. , as well as \u201cearly music\u201d like Palestrina. I\u2019m a big fan of David Munrow and the Early Music Consort of London. Then there\u2019s the blues: Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Willie Dixon, Memphis Slim, Paul Butterfield, Mike Bloomfield, Eric Clapton, Slim Harpo, Rufus Thomas, Little Walter, and so many more. Then there\u2019s the ultra-huge pop/rock category, along with the folk genre which became more or less absorbed by rock. The Mothers of Invention, Heart, the Beatles, the Kinks, the Cranberries, Devo, Cream, The Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, the Police, Roy Orbison, Joni Mitchell, Donovan, Gene Pitney, Tom Petty, Coldplay, Clannad, Enya, and a big dose of surf (The Ventures, The Chantays, Los Straitjackets, The Bambi Molesters, The Aqua Velvets, Messer Chups, Slacktone, etc.). I also like what I guess you could call \u201cethnic\u201d music. That is, it\u2019s not standard Americanized pop, but well-loved in other parts of the world. That would include Balinese Gamelan, Indian ragas, Dead Can Dance, South American music adapted from indigenous folk music like Kantu, etc. Then there\u2019s the comedy and spoken word stuff\u2026 but that wasn\u2019t part of the question, so I\u2019ll stop here!

            "answer_text": "My friend, you have asked my favorite question. And requested my answer too!! Happy day!! Four main genres persist throughout my musical expeditions. Indie Rock, Atmospheric Black Metal, Dark Synth and Post Rock. I don\u2019t limit myself to these genres but, I do seem to return to them often. Here\u2019s four bands that embody the best of each. And a couple more just cause :) ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: INDIE ROCK - The Suburbs by Arcade Fire  I often shy away from claiming one albums superiority over another. The multitude of amazing albums available from every corner of the world make it difficult for one album to rise above the rest. Save for one exception. In 2010, Canadian Indie Rock band Arcade Fire released The Suburbs. This is such a special album. Its impossible to enjoy it in its entirety on first listen. Arcade Fire excels at what I call musical foreshadowing by inserting reprises before the piece of music being reprised. When these familiar riffs kick in late in the album, your washed over with a sense of relief. Like something important that was lost is now found. It makes you feel like no matter what, everything and everyone are going to be just fine. Its incredible. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ATMOSPHERIC BLACK METAL - Umbras de Barbagia by Downfall of Nur  Don\u2019t let my love of Indie Rock fool you. I\u2019m a Metal addict. I\u2019ve seen at least 50 Metal shows over the years and I don\u2019t plan on stopping. One sub-genre of Metal seems to especially pique my interest time and time again. Black Metal. Dig a bit deeper and you\u2019ll find the somewhat controversial sub-sub-genre of Atmospheric Black Metal. I say controversial because recently, this genre has garnered attention outside its core fan base. A younger generation has side stepped Metal completely to become die hard Atmospheric Black Metal fans. Taken in by the brilliantly crafted Avante Garde style presentation and the Shoe-gazer-like wall of sound, this new fan base was so disruptive that, a new genre emerged called Blackgaze. Because of their insistence to remove the scratchy screaming vocals that are found in most Black Metal bands, the Metal community doesn\u2019t even recognize this as a sub-genre of Metal. I personally find Blackgaze bands to be a bit pretentious but, whatever. Atmospheric Black Metal is still being made by a ton of amazing artists. Even if you\u2019ve never considered yourself a Metal head, I highly suggest paying attention to this corner of the musical spectrum. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: DARK SYNTH - Leather Teeth by Carpenter Brut  DARK SYNTH - New Model by Perturbator  I\u2019ve only been listening to Dark Synth for about a year now. I only know two bands in the genre. Carpenter Brut and Perturbator. Perturbator\u2019s album New Model is the missing link between Skinny Puppy and early Nine Inch Nails. It is a triumphant deep dive into a strange unfamiliar future still poisoned with mankind's sickening dilemma. Dark stuff brother. Leather Teeth by Carpenter Brut isn\u2019t quite as dark. Brut is a much more dynamic artist. He has no problem jumping genres and mixing influences. There\u2019s a lot going on and he offers no apologies or answers to his insane trip through genres and time periods. His other albums I, II, III make up an 80 minute companion series called Trilogy that has become one of my favorite things to listen to. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: POST ROCK - The Sea by Somali Yacht Club  This is probably the most accessible and easiest to get into of my picks. I\u2019ve all but exhausted my thoughts and opinions on Post Rock in other threads so, I\u2019ll keep this short. You can put this on in any situation, ever. It will match the mood no matter what. That\u2019s the best quality of Post Rock. Everyone likes it. Or, at least, nobody doesn\u2019t like it? It\u2019s interesting enough to talk about with your hipster friends yet harmless enough to have on the stereo in a car ride with your parents. Guaranteed. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: HONORABLE MENTION - Advaitic Songs by Om  HONARABLE MENTION - New Flesh by Priest  I\u2019m not sure what Om is. But, I want people to hear it. I don\u2019t know what Priest is either. Maybe a subset of Dark Synth. I dunno. I love it for some reason. Can\u2019t put my finger on it. Such a wonderfully strange album. Thanks for the question!! Enjoy!! ",

This is kind of a personal miscellaneous category. For me it\u2019s: Lady Gaga, the queen Bey, Nicki Minaj, Kesha, Lorde, Rihanna, TSwift, Jessie J, Britney, and all that shit like line dances (Cupid Shuffle, Cha Cha Slide), Journey, Queen, any 90\u2019s super hit - all the shit you can use to say, \u201cLAST SONG - PARTY\u2019S OVER - HAVE A BLAST - NOW GO HOME!\u201d One of my faaaaavorite things is discovering local bands at cheap concerts!

Country and rap get a lot of hate, but there are some songs I adore from those genres. OH SHIT also I love classical! My fave composers are Debussy, Joplin (ragtime), Rachmaninoff, Gershwin (genre, genre, who cares??), Mozart, Chopin, annnnd hmm\u2026 I\u2019m DEFINITELY FORGETTING A LOT.

            "answer_text": "I listen to a variety of music, but I mainly listen to film scores and trailer scores. Now, trailer scores are pretty much music scores made for movie trailers, marketing and advertising. It may sound weird, but it's awesome music. Now, I love listening to trailer music more nowadays compared to modern music, however, there's a ton of artists and bands I love listening to due to memories or pure nostalgia. Modern music, in my opinion, doesn\u2019t really give me an impact of feelings or sensations, like if there\u2019s a lack of adding a pure feeling to a song. This is the very first trailer score I heard back around 2013, give it a listen.  Now, to me, this was something new, like \u201cWow, that was outstanding, I need more of this music.\u201d So obviously, I searched for more. Some of the more well known music companies are Two Steps From Hell, Audiomachine and Immediate Music. However, there\u2019s a lot more trailer music companies, a number that I don\u2019t know. I love this music, it\u2019s amazing, and there are also amazing composers that make music that sometimes is hard to describe. Let me give you an album preview with really epic and massive music.  Now this, I love this music, it\u2019s just out of this world. Really Slow Motion is my favorite music producer with various composers from around the world. GianTapes Music is a music label inside Really Slow Motion that is especially made towards the industry. Really Slow Motion do release tracks from their industry albums, GianTapes albums as well, into public releases. I definitely recommend Battle Angel, their latest release with a total of 25 tracks.  Overall, I love this music, it gives music a whole new level of pure imaginations, emotions and feelings. It\u2019s known as epic music for a reason, and I will never lose the love for it. ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite singer is Yoko Ono; I am actually one of the few vocal Yoko fans on Quora to my knowledge. I\u2019ve been into her music since I was fourteen years old and heard her vocals on the White Album around the same time she also released her seminal 1994 album, Rising. Here are some answers I\u2019ve written about Yoko: Chris Pierce's answer to As an artist, what do you think of Yoko Ono? Chris Pierce's answer to What is the context of the performance of Yoko Ono screaming? Chris Pierce's answer to Is the album \"Unfinished Music No. 2: Life With the Lions\" by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, simply \"misunderstood\" by musical and cultural illiterates, or is it just the biggest POC ever released by a major artist? And here\u2019s an answer I am proud on that draws on Yoko and another singer I like, Diamanda Galas: Chris Pierce's answer to What are the cultural ideologies that form and underlie our current perspective on aesthetics, and how are they different from past and possibly, future paradigms?  Other than Yoko, I tend to like noise, improvisation, and song-writerly types of music. A playlist I might make today would include the bands Swans, Melt Banana, ooioo, some electronic experimental work and jazz (I am just getting somewhat more into jazz as a genre), while also including the Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan types of songwriters. I also have a deep love of gothic rock and old school country music. I am a recorded sound cataloger currently, and though I focus mainly on spoken word and radio, I still get some opportunity to catalog some interesting music from European labels like Cold Spring, Intakt, Fremeaux & associes, etc. ",

I\u2019ve been in choir since the 4th grade, and I\u2019ve consistently been in a choir every year since for 8 years, and I hope to continue this trend until I die, or can\u2019t sing. Anyways, choral music is so powerful, with amazing lyrics, melodies, harmonies, and group bonding. I\u2019ve made life long friends through choir, and have made personal connections to songs. For example, Come Thou Fount is my favorite song I\u2019ve ever sung. It\u2019s not because of the lyrics, it\u2019s because of the stories, friends and adventures I\u2019ve had learning this song. Choir has become a part of who I am, and has enriched my life so much. My next goal in choir is to get a part in Eric Whitacre\u2019s virtual choir five. If you ever feel down, or just need a way to express, choir music can do this, there\u2019s a song for murdering people, helping people, being obnoxious, and, of course, being happy. Choir really has it all. Choir rules! ",

I also enjoy listening to vocal ensembles such as Chanticleer and The King\u2019s Singers. As a learning singer and musician, I believe that every song and genre has its own challenges to take care of, and those challenges are what excite me continuously to get better in music - there is hence no better genre or style than the other, and there is no need to diss a genre or style if it is not our cup of tea because all types of expression are valid.

Country because way back I had an old car where the radio was stuck on one station that played rock music. Then, the station switched genre to Country. In about a week I found that I liked country. Hillbilly music because my journey into country led me there. Go find some songs by the band \u201cOld And In The Way\" if you'd like to hear some good examples. Classical music because my dad liked classical and listened to it all the time. Beethoven's 6th is one of my favorites. Cowboy music for the same reason as classical. I reccomend looking into \u201cRiders In The Sky\". They did the song \u201cWoody's Roundup\u201d for the movie Toy Story 2. Swing music for the same reason as above. \u201cBig Bad Voodoo Daddy\u201d along with the classics Like Benny Goodman. Texas swing because I like country and swing. The band \u201cAsleep at the Wheel\" is a good example. Celtic music because my grandparents on my mother's side were from Scotland. I got more interested in it later when I saw groups like \u201cCeltic Thunder\" and \u201cCeltic Women\" on TV. Current popular music because there are still people out there making good music. \u201cCake by the Ocean\" by DNCE is one I like. There are others I can't name because I drive an older car and the radio doesn't tell me who's playing what, and the DJs rarely announce it anymore. Eclectic covers. For example, \u201cWild Horses\" by the Rolling Stones has been covered by many\u2026 Susan Boyle, Miley Cyrus, Garth Brooks, and the band \u201cOld an in the Way\" just to name a few. Something different because I don't like to listen to the same type of music all the time. I had dinner at a Peruvian restaurant last night and they had a couple musicians playing Peruvian music.

I'd think the music I listen to the most since I discovered it about 5yrs back, film score or soundtrack music, I realized I do love orchestral music which is the make up of most film scores, however I don't really love classical music, to me film score has more of a emotional core, the strangest thing is am from Jamaica,  where the biggest thing is reggae and dancehall, but I was just never a fan, everyone else loves to but growing up in it I was never a fan, oww!!

I know the terms because I read music magazines. I have heard of Kathy Perry, and Leann Rhymes, but if one of them came on the radio, would I know the difference. Is Rhymes a country singer. Then maybe I would. I don\u2019t like a lot of rap. I do like The Message by Grandmaster Flash, or is that Hip Hop. Sometimes I get confused. I was a big fan of Punk. But I also liked some of the music that Punk was supposedly against. But you would read later that some of those punk guys actually were fans of artists they weren\u2019t supposed to be fans of. I like country music, but not Garth Brooks country, but people Steve Earle, Emmylou Harris, Townes Van Zandt. I like to hear music from around the world, particularly folk music. But I\u2019m also a big fan of shonen Knife. I like the music coming from africa, such as Felif Kuti Opera is something I like when I bother to listen to. but I don\u2019t bother listen to it a lot. Jazz. I like some. But can\u2019t say which. I do know I\u2019m a big fan of Peggy Lee. But that would be more to with her voice Classical. I\u2019m not a big fan. But there is something I like, such as Mars, The Bringer of War. Most of my favourite songs tend to be in the rock, pop. But That could also be because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard most of. ",

            "answer_text": "I listen to a wide variety of music, be it classical, rock, post-rock, new age, even soundtracks! Besides the reason that the music is simply beautiful, I think my reasoning behind soundtracks is most interesting. If, for example, there is a tv-show/movie/series with great music, then listening to that music allows me to relive and revisit the emotions I felt when watching. Besides, as \u2018background music\u2019 soundtracks do their jobs very well\u2026 I listen to classical music especially to listen to it, as opposed to passing time or having it in the background whilst reading/working. Classical music is something that requires attention to be enjoyed\u2026 hence why many people can\u2019t listen to it nowadays. Another type of music that I enjoy is the kind that gets your blood flowing, like Peter Cincotti\u2019s \u2018Angel town\u2019 or Tim Mcmorris his \u2018Out of control\u2019. Both of these have original lyrics as well as versatile melodies. The ingenuity behind good music is one of my main reasons to enjoy it. Another thing worth mentioning is the relationship between music and mood. if you\u2019re in a particular mood, then the corresponding music will resonate with that mood. ",

I grew up listening to country since my parents and older siblings listen to country all the time. A lot of the new country is country-pop. I listen to some pop. It all depends on the song. Some artists like, *inwardly cringes* Justin Bieber are horrible to my ear drums. Whenever I hear JB on the radio, advertisment or not on my own accord, I apologize internally to my poor ears. My poor ears. I feel so bad for them. Sorry to all you Justin Beaver, er I mean Bieber fans out there. ",

I\u2019m a Beledi dancer and love those beats (which occur in lots of different genres). I love Celtic music - the less smaltzy kind anyway. I love funk, glam rock, the Beatles and lots of 60s/70s stuff that wasn\u2019t rock. I love lots of the cheesy 80s hairband stuff LOL Mama Mia made me realize that I know all the lyrics of Abba songs. Who knew? I love Bruno Mars :D I also love madrigals (especially to sing), Mozart, Beethoven, Ravel, Debussy, Rachmaninoff (most of the Russian composers actually), Liszt, Gershwin, and Swing music. Classic blues. New Orleans jazz. Spanish guitar. SOME Hawaiian music. Some JRock. Lots of ballad singers from all over the world (I appreciate \u2018lounge singers\u2019 :D) Queen Latifa. Missy Elliott! Beatles Forever, Led Zeppelin Rules, Big Bang Fighting! is currently my mantra LOL ",

I have spent over 300 dollars on apple music, bought Spotify premium, and inherited tons of cds from my dads collection of music.From a young age, I was brought up listening to the smooth styling's of Pat Metheny and Herbie Hancock with my cousins, who were big jazz fans.Then, came the rock phase. AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Lynyrd Skynrd and others filled my ears. Then, as I got older I branched out into more foreign stuff. (Maybe not foreign too you quora members, but foreign to a lot of kids my age.) Epic music and Scores.I was always fascinated with movies, and more importantly the music. I found myself listening to Hans Zimmer and James Horner as I fall asleep, and then waking up to hear the beautiful orchestra and choir of Two Steps From Hell.I don't like rap, or country, or any mainstream music nowadays. I was always listening to stuff, making my mundane life of school and work more epic with the music in my headphones. Music, is a wonderful thing. ",

            "answer_text": "I always like listening to the soft pop genre. I can generally feel the song inside me and relate with it considerably. Some of my favourite artists in this genre are Westlife, Ronan Keating, Shane Filan, Markus Feehily, Brian McFadden and John Mayer. My favourite singer, though is John Mayer, hands down. His melodies touch my heart and his guitar tugs at my soul. And what can I say about his lyrics? This is a self-made man who left home at 17 to chase his dreams with his guitar by his side and boy, did he make it big. He is by far the best songwriter in the business. He puts his soul into his songs and writes such meaningful and awe-inspiring poetry. He writes songs about stardom, loneliness, heartbreak, fight, struggle, loss, death, victory, highs and lows et al. All in all, Mayer writes about every human emotion. Another musician I highly respect is Eminem. Although he is not a part of the pop genre, he is another self-made man who has made it big fighting against all odds.

This year I\u2019ve also gotten a good bit into singer/songwriters. People like John Mayer, Jason Mraz, and Jack Johnson. It feels cool to listen to pop music that I really enjoy. Almost makes me feel more connected to the general population in a weird way. And it IS good too. ",

            "answer_text": "Music is the one place that the divine speaks directly to us. It is the purest language, a language of direct experience and emotion, not a language of concepts which are a generation removed from their content. I find no better place to be understood by the world and no greater refuge from the world. It is both a calling to serve and a source of purpose. I find both myself and the endless magic of the universe there. There are no better days than to sit isolated, composing and communing with the mysterious that lies beyond our day to day living. No relationship, no personal interaction with another person which can even be measured in the same way. Personal love and day to day activities are but an inconsequential grains of sand in the vast beach of divine warmth which bathes us in sound and to find yourself at the very heart of that fire is all there is. There is nothing higher to experience and nothing higher to aspire to than to be a conduit by which that divine force comes into our world. To have your personal self burned away in the heat of the divine flame and to merge with the universal greater than yourself. That is what makes a life worth living. ",

            "answer_text": "I listen to all kinds of music, but the two genres that I tend to gravitate towards are folk music and experimental instrumental music. I love folk music because it seems to be more deeply rooted in human nature than other genres. It harkens to the days when music was one of man's only form of entertainment. It evokes an almost primal emotion in me, a kind of raw feeling. I like new age and experimental instrumental music because it seems to be the purest form of artistic expression. The way it is executed makes it possible to be able to hear exactly the thoughts that the artist is trying to convey; there is no buffer between the artist's intent and the limitations of the medium in which the intent is expressed.  Overall, the best music to me is the kind that is closest to the fundamentals of the human condition. ",

I'll listen to Halsey and Melanie Martinez on occasion. But one I listen to, not as mycsp as my favs but still quite a bit, is Set It Off. The way I find groups, typically, is I listen to a song by them on YouTube, search for the song by itself, cause most of the time neither song nor artist are in the title. Or I'll hear it in a movie, find it, realize I've loved the band since forever, and constantly listen to their songs. CoughFOBcough ",

There's a controversial sub-genre of metal known as metalcore. Many metalheads/metalfans deny that metalcore is not metal because this sub-genre is a fusion of Hardcore Punk and metal having no good breakdowns and emotional lyrics just as it is for hardcore/post hardcore genres. Above all, I choose to listen to metal is because metal takes talent. It needs true inspiration for one to write a lyric unlike those pop artists whose lyrics are 90% about Girls, Butt, Party and sex appealing song videos. ",

Music back in the 60\u2019s and so fourth had so much more meaning than the songs on the radio these days, which consist of drugs, ass, sex, money and drinking. Don\u2019t get me wrong, of course I listen to music now days. I\u2019m 16. But rock music back then was so much better and still is! I love listening to some good Fleetwood Mac, The Cure, Pink Floyd, Hall and Oats, etc. It\u2019s quality music! ",

I really enjoy jazz, especially anything from the BeBop era, but Big Band Jazz, not so much. Again, go figure. That\u2019s the amazing thing about music: good or bad, love it or leave it, it\u2019s completely your call. About how many other things in life do you have such freedom? ",

I\u2019m a huge fan of Rock music, in all of its various shades, from the most classic bands like Queen, The Clash or Led Zeppelin to more modern ones such as Rise Against, Arctic Monkeys and Green Days. Last summer I attended a Foo Fighters concert for example. I love classical music, mostly composers such as Mozart or Bach, with Chopin being my all time favourite. I like also ambient and post-rock music, with groups such as Helios or The Album Leaf. Huge fan of Metal and I\u2019ve been to various metal concerts such as Iron Maiden or Slipknot. I also occasionally enjoy some Blues, Jazz or Folk music. I listen to too many types of music and listing them all here would honestly take too much. ",

I'd have to say that classic roCk is my all time fave, so it was played most, and country the least. There was a ton of Sade, Tupac, Selena, Al Green, Barry White, lots of Jazz and R&B .. Today my boys (31 & 22 years okd) and I are still on the same page with our music being all 3 of ours passion, along with allk 3 if us being artist on a canvas, as well as well as on the skin.

Therefore I listen mainly to Classical music as it is loosely called. I also listen to what in the UK was called \u201cTrad Jazz\u201d an English version of New Orleans jazz that was enormously popular in my youth and have recently developed a taste for Stride piano as played by Stephanie Trick. As I get older I find myself more and more drawn to Chamber music. ",
