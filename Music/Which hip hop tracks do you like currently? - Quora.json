            "answer_text": "Ok, I have to preface this answer by saying 2 things first: One, when you reach a certain age (and you should be able to guess my age just based on some of the videos I\u2019m sharing with you) you tend to get \u201cout of touch\u201d somewhat with popular culture, or assume the music from your generation is somehow \u201cbetter.\u201d But in some cases, like Tupac, yes rap WAS a hell of a lot better in the 1990s, hate to say. And two, some of tracks I\u2019m sharing will be rap, not technically hip hop. But they\u2019re good, so I thought I\u2019d share them. Tupac, California Love! (Yes, the West Coast really DOES kick the Northeast\u2019s ass, in a LOT of ways, and not just in RAP)  Tupac: Changes  And one more from Tupac, a personal favorite of mine, Thugz Mansion:  And again, more rap from Snoop Dogg, Gin and Juice, have I corrupted the kids yet? Nope, haven\u2019t done my job then! (Sarcasm)  Ice Cube: It was a Good Day  Ok, now that I\u2019ve gone off topic a bit, back to what you asked for, hip hop. (There appears to be a debate saying that hip-hop and rap are the same thing, but I think of them as related, but not the same thing) And now Aaliyah, the original \u201cOld Soul\u201d herself (I swear, she\u2019s 15 going on 35) Age Ain\u2019t Nothing But a Number:  Aaliyah, Are You that Somebody:  Bone Thugs N Harmony, Crossroads (Yeah, just ventured into rap again)  Outkast, Hey Ya!  Outcast, The Way You Move:  Nelly, Hot in Here:  Ginuwine, Pony: (Yup, this is straight up about sex, period)  Mark Morrison, Return of the Mack (I just like the way this sounds, for some reason)  Mary J. Blige, Family Affair: (Apparently Oprah really likes this song, she said as much on her syndicated talk show on network television back in the day)  Mary J. Blige, Be Without You:  Usher (and assorted others) Yeah!:  Usher, DJ Got Us Fallin In Love Again (I really like the way this song sounds as well):  Aaliyah once again, because, well she\u2019s just awesome. Try Again  R. Kelly: Bump N\u2019 Grind (Yes, it\u2019s another song about Sex, but it\u2019s R. Kelly! Kind of goes with the territory):  Warren G: Regulate (Yet more rap, but it\u2019s another song that for whatever reason I really like the way it sounds)  Outkast: Ms. Jackson:  50 Cent: In Da Club: (by now, I\u2019ll just go from rap to hip hop without warning):  Montell Jordan: This Is How We Do It:  This song is over 30 years old, came out when I was a kid, but seriously, it\u2019s got a valid point: Bobby Brown, My Prerogative:  Here\u2019s yet another song that came out before a good portion of you were born, Pebbles, Girlfriend:  Pebbles: Mercedes Boy: (another oldie but goodie)  I\u2019m really giving away my age here, but Jody Watley: Real Love:  Janet Jackson (Miss Jackson if you\u2019re nasty) Pleasure Principal (again, another song that I really like the way it sounds):  Terence Trent d\u2019Arby: Wishing Well: (I may have inadvertantely ventured off of hip hop at this point, don\u2019t worry, not many more links)  And now closer to the present, I leave you with Rihanna, Umbrella:  You\u2019ll notice several artists are missing from this list, namely Beyonce, Eminem, Justin Timberlake, etc. Because personally, they are so overplayed it\u2019s ridiculous. So no, not putting them in this list, because you can literally hear them, every freakin\u2019 where. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not really a fan of Hip Hop when it stands on its own, but since you A2Aed\u2026 I like it when it mixes with another genres. But it doesn\u2019t happen all the time even, say I\u2019m not really convinced when Jay-Z sang along with Chester Benington\u2014may he rest in peace. I think Jay-Z, later on the video realized he\u2019s in the wrong neighborhood when Chester begun to scream, just look at his reaction, it\u2019s hilarious. Mike Shinoda, however, is a really good artist. I just love his poetry and the songs he wrote for Linkin Park.  So I\u2019m more into RapMetal, and artists may include Kid Rock, Rage Against the Machines, Limp Bizkit\u2014they\u2019re Hard Core but I like it, of course Linkin Park. Riders on the Storm by The Doors ft. Snoop Dog\u2014Snoop is a Hip Hop artist right? This track I begun to like when I was playing Need For Speed Underground 2, and that was a long time ago.  And I have been listening to Korn\u2014metal band, and I like it when they feature DJ\u2019s in some of their songs. Listen to this: Korn ft. Skrillex - Get Up  Lastly, I have listened to Eminem few times before, but I can\u2019t seem to recall any of his piece. I guess it was good, but it hadn\u2019t make a mark on me. ",
