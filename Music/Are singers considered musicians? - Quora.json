            "answer_text": "Haha OF COURSE they are. They are playing the most complex instrument: the vocal chords. Singers actually perform the most important part of any song: the melody. There are 3 elements (only 3) to all music making and song and composition: Melody: the storyHarmony: the chords, the background, the scenery, against which the story is happening.Rhythm: the pace of the story, how busy, how relaxed, where what happens, etc.Of these 3, the story, melody, is the most important in music. Of course: in dance music, the groove, meaning rhyhm, is more important than the story. You don\u2019t go to dance DJ show to sit back, relax, and listen to the music. You go there to dance like your life depended on it. Anyone who produces, performs or creates music, is a musician. Some are better than others, but that doesn\u2019t matter because we get into the realm of subjective opinion when it gets into comparisons or discussions about \u201cquality\u201d or \u201clevel\u201d. For example: is world class keyboard player Jordan Rudess from Dream Theater a better musician than Janis Joplin or even Jimi Hendrix. Well in terms of chops, musical knowledge and so on\u2026 yes he knows more and can do more challenging things performance wise. However: there is a reason why people still remember Janis or Jimi over 40 years after they passed, and still listen to their music. So in other words: it depends on where you lay your criteria and on your taste. \u201cBetter\u201d, \u201cnot as good\u201d etc, are merely just subjective personal opinions when it comes to music and musicianship. That is why, depending which direction you lean towards, one could say that everyone of us really is a musician, because each one of us at some point sang in the bathroom or hummed a tune we like. All that being said: Yes, because the vocal chords are an instrument and because singers perform the most important part in a song, they ARE absolutely musicians. Their vocal chords, are their instruments. They are holding their instrument just like a guitar player does. They are just not holding it with their hands, but in their throat. ",

            "answer_text": "The definition of musician - According to Merriam Webster Dictionary -: a composer, conductor, or performer of music; especially, instrumentalist. Are singers performer of music? Of course. So, by definition singers are musicians. I am more interested in the choise of wording in your question though. You did not ask if singers are musicians, but chose to go with \u201cAre singers considered musicians?\u201d. Either you are totally out of the music scene, as in you have not participated in any musical activity all your life, so this choise of wording is out of pure ignorance (which is totally fine by the way) or you are actively pursuing something about music, but put way too much weight on what other people think. I am vastly extrapolating here and making a wild guess that you are aspiring to sing. If that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t worry about what other people think. Maybe you suck right now, but hey, everyone sucked at some point. Keep working. Keep singing. Doesn\u2019t matter if they think you are a musician or not, after all, that is just a label. (Sheet) Music can be very strongly related to mathematics, but at the end of the day, music is art. It is heavily related to feelings, and feelings don\u2019t care about labels. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry Andy Briggs but I disagree. Singers definitely are musicians. Particularly classical and operatic singers, who spend years learning and perfecting the breathing and voice control techniques necessary to sing properly. They also have the ability to read music and memorise hours of it in order to perform on stage. You may have noticed that dramatic classical performers and operatic singers acting on stage are not holding any music !! They also need to be able to follow the musical instructions of the conductor/director of the performance and follow the orchestra as well. No ad libing here! It takes many years to become proficient in all of this. So you don\u2019t have to be physically holding an instrument to be a musician! The actual making of music by people using their voice or an instrument is definitely musicianship. Also, Trish Dooley you said \u2018A musician who plays supporting music for singers is called an accompanist.\u2019 By your own words, they are still musicians. Yes, they are ALSO know as accompanists, but are definitely still musicians !! ",

To quote a google search, \u201cA musician is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented.\u201d \u201cMusically talented\u201d also means singing, so in theory, Yes, singers are musicians.

Myself in my group saying for Atlantic Records for 10 years, for Reprise records 2 years, 4 Golden world and Ric Tic records for nearly four years and we ended recording part of our careers with Columbia Records. I'm not absolutely positive but I think I have a small amount of credentials. It may not be apparent to something but singers have vocal cords which are an instrument of the human body to communicate to others. I hope that is of some help to you. ",
