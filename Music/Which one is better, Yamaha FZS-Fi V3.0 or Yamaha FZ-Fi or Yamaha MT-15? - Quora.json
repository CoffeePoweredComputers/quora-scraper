            "answer_text": "FZ and FZS are the same bike. Just an engine cowl and chrome treatment extra on the FZS. The engine has been carried forward from the v2 with some tweaks but those tweaks are not visible in day to day rides. It is the most refined 150cc bike in its segment but severely underpowered which is where enthusiasts would find it boring. The bike takes time to pull. MT15 has a great power delivery, so it isn't boring at all. Refinement and reliability is good and comfort levels are good too. The price is higher but you get a better 155cc engine on this one\u2026 19.3 PS/14.7 Nm vs 13.2PS/12.8 Nm on the FZ/S. 6 gears on the MT15 make it more calm on highways although wind blasts play spoilsport. Given a choice, if money is not an issue, MT15 over FZ/S. Sometimes, power comes in handy. Rest is your wish. Happy riding. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are best in its own aspects. MT-15 is more powerful than FZ V3. FZ V3 have bigger seats than MT-15. MT-15 Vs FZ V3: MT-15 is best for both commute and longer rides. But it will give lesser comfort than FZ V3 because it has bigger seats. MT-15 is powerful than FZ V3 it will be a better fun bike you can enjoy all the day. It has 6 gears but FZ V3 has 5 gears only. FZ V3 is cheaper than MT-15 but if prize is okay then you can definitely go for MT-15. MT-15 is better choice. ",
