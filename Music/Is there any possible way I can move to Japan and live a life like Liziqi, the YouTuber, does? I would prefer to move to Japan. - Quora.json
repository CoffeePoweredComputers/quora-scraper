            "answer_text": "It is possible to move to Japan, but it can be extremely difficult. It\u2019s certainly not impossible - there have been countless people who have done it (myself included). However, the overwhelming majority of people there did not simply wake up one day and decide to move to Japan. Most of them went there to work, and many others to marry someone in Japan. If you are to live in Japan, you are going to need a job. You are also going to need to speak at least some Japanese at a basic conversational level of proficiency. If you do not have a job waiting for you there, and you do not speak Japanese (or think you could learn very quickly - no, what you see in anime does not count), then I would strongly advise against having any idea of \u201cmoving\u201d to Japan. Japan is not an ideal country to move to on a whim. It is a wonderful country, certainly to visit as a guest, but it takes a lot of work to live there, and more work to adapt to life in Japan as a foreigner. Instead, I would suggest you visit Japan. If you make friends there, and if you somehow find a job opportunity there, and if you can arrange the difficult tasks around getting a place to live as a foreigner, taking care of the paperwork required for residency and so on, then you will still have to ask yourself: do I really want to live in Japan?
