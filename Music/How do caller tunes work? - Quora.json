            "answer_text": "When a customer subscribes to the caller tunes service, that information gets stored in his \"HLR\" profile. The HLR profile stores all kinds of permissions and configurations for a particular customer, e.g. whether he will be allowed to make an international call, whether he is a prepay or postpay customer, whether he can use Data or not, etc. etc.  So when a customer who has \"CRBT(customized ring back tone; the rather official name of caller tunes) On\" flag in his HLR, whenever he calls a B party, he listens to his selected ring back tones instead of  the generic dialing sound.  The RBT sound clips are stored in a media server, and streamed online as and when required. These clips are usually stored in wav format with very low bit rates. They are uploaded by the content providers, and stored in the operator's CRBT media server.  So I guess that's a very layman's description of the caller tunes service. Thanks for the A2A. Missed the deadline, but still tried writing down whatever I know. ",
