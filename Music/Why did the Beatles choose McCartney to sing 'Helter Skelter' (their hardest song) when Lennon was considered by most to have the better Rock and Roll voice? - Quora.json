            "answer_text": "Yikes. So much to unpack here. Well, for a start, the Beatle who wrote the song usually sang it. We know by now that the Lennon-McCartney head-to-head songwriting partnership was mostly over after 1964 or so. Thereafter, Lennon and McCartney each tended to write songs by themselves, and then bring them to the other for feedback, polishing and general problem solving. That is the process by which most of the classic Lennon-McCartney songs were created. It so happened that sometimes, one of them would sing a song written by the other. McCartney wrote both \u2018Eight Days a Week\u2019 and \u2018Every Little Thing\u2019, but Lennon sings both of them, probably because they both felt that he\u2019d sing them better. And Lennon\u2019s unforced, brassy voice certainly serves these songs very well. \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019 is a different kettle of fish. It was written by McCartney when the band were feeling less collegial than they\u2019d felt in a long time. McCartney wanted to emulate The Who by doing something crazily heavy, so the band reconfigured itself, with Lennon picking up their recently acquired Fender Bass VI as well as playing rhythm guitar, McCartney joining Harrison on guitar as well as playing bass, and the band\u2019s assistant Mal Evans playing trumpet, an instrument he couldn\u2019t actually play. The sessions for the song seem to have been a brief moment of group togetherness and high spirits amid an otherwise grim slog of an album. McCartney has more than one voice. There\u2019s the clean, crooning voice he used on songs such as \u2018Till There Was You\u2019, \u2018Eleanor Rigby\u2019 and \u2018Yesterday\u2019, and then there\u2019s the ragged rock & roll yelp he used on \u2018Long Tall Sally\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m Down\u2019, \u2018Oh! Darling\u2019 and, indeed, \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019. This was based on McCartney\u2019s love of Little Richard\u2019s voice; it\u2019s as if he plugs his vocal chords into some sort of organic fuzzbox. In any case, since the band was trying to be as heavy as The Who, McCartney\u2019s yelp was closer to Roger Daltrey\u2019s scream than Lennon\u2019s voice ever was, besides which it\u2019s doubtful that Lennon would have wanted to sing such a daft stylistic exercise. So that, I think, is why McCartney sang this; he was the one whose heart was really in it, the others were just having a laugh. For what it\u2019s worth, I personally regard \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019 as an utter failure. As Ian Macdonald noted, the band sounds like a puny featherweight trying and failing to puff himself up into a serious contender. The guitar tone is feeble, the groove is pedestrian and plodding compared to the athletic, aggressive pace of The Who\u2019s best recordings, and the whole thing is vastly overrated by a certain kind of Beatle fan who wrongly believes this to be any kind of real influence on later rock, as opposed to a lame attempt to emulate an already existing music. I love the Beatles, but they were crap at emulating this sort of rock. They didn\u2019t have it in them. Lennon\u2019s \u2018I Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u2019 is, in my opinion, a far heavier recording, despite having less fuzz and being less self-consciously rockish. I will happily listen to \u2018Revolution Nine\u2019, but I skip \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019. If I want to listen to somebody trying to sound like The Who, I\u2019ll listen to the Small Faces\u2019 \u2018Afterglow\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply because Paul wrote it. John had his own song Yer Blues to scream on on the White Album anyway. If Paul had given John Helter Skelter then people would have thought John wrote it and that Paul couldn't sing those kind of songs. John said in his Rolling Stone interview at the end of 1970 that he wishes Paul had asked him to sing Oh Darling because he felt he could have done a better job (it took Paul lots of takes (and he smoked lots of cigarettes) to get his vocals right but it's the same thing: Paul wrote it and did a great job anyway. Maybe John would have done a better job with both those songs or maybe not of at least John could have sung in them with Paul but John wasn't asking Paul to sing on his songs so maybe both could have invited each other to sing together more but that didn't happen much. Paul said in his biography \u201cMany years from now\u201d that they weren't singing on each other's songs much near the end and he wished they had sung together more. He said he thought John would have liked that too but they never reality thought to ask. Paul did have John sing on \u201cThe Two of Us\u201d on Let it Be though which was a good thing because it sounds really nice plus John didn't contribute as much to that album as Paul (even the version of the stunning \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d released on Let it Be had been recorded in 1968 for a wildlife charity album the year before and they just sped up that version and altered it but John's vocals were from the 1968 version and The Beatles instruments too I think).
