            "answer_text": "He seems to be a very solid player, indeed. But a lot of people associate great guitar playing with \u2018guitar-olympics\u2019 style soloing, unfortunately. So people like Richie Havens and Toy Caldwell aren\u2019t crazy enough with their solos\u2026even though they are great players in rhythm and style (except Havens is really a great rhythm player and not a soloist that I\u2019ve ever seen). To be put on a pedestal, a player has to go way above and beyond, and/or just get the right press, and some of them work their careers that way, while others just want to be in a band, recognition for their craft or not. Them\u2019s my thotz\u2026cheers! ",
