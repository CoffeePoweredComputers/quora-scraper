            "answer_text": "prepare yourself for a long list! I\u2019Il put actual kpop groups in the beginning and then at the end put some soloists I stan for fun cause why not? MCND  I really like their personalities, and they are very unique from other boy groups. They seem to get along well and have awesome content. They also have very talented rapper and vocalists. Such a sweet fanbase. CIX  Awesome discography. What else can I say? Also a really supportive fanbase. I hope they do quite well in their next comeback. Stray Kids  They are quite talented and I like their music videos. Also Chan needs to sleep. As do all of them. As do like every other kpop idol. Blackpink  Gosh, they all look so good in this photo. I honestly really like their music. Every song is so iconic. DKB  They are such good dancers. I also got really interested in them cause two of them do a lot of acrobatics stuff and it was really cool watching them practice in a vlog. BTS  Absolute icons. Mamamoo  I really like their personalities a lot. I sometimes struggle to get into girl groups cause it\u2019s hard for me to connect with them, but I immediately could like this group. GOT7  Once again, I really love their personalities. Also, can we get some better treatment for them please? OnlyOneOf  Pure visuals. Also I really enjoy their dance covers. Teen Top  I really like this group. They deserve so much. They have a very kind fanbase (from my experience) and I think they have some amazing foot work in their choreography. Winner  People really don\u2019t appreciate these guys enough (although their fan base is so chill and kind). Absolute kings of the tropical party concept and sad songs. (G)I-DLE  Their discography is top tier. Also, absolute queens. Woo!Ah!  They\u2019re such a chill group, yet so talented, yet so underrated. Oneus  KINGS! KINGS! KINGS! Check out their Road to Kingdom performances! They are so talented! Great fanbase! TXT  Check our their recent comeback. I really liked it. 1the9  This is the only temporary group I\u2019ve ever stanned and I\u2019m sure glad I did. They\u2019re a really underrated group, but they have such a nice fanbase. The Rose  I really like Woosung\u2019s voice and they\u2019re overall a really good band. I also feel bad about the whole company situation but hopefully they figure that out :) Jannabi  Amazing vocals and instrumentals. Check out their cover of Viva La Vida! It\u2019s really good. They\u2019re also quite funny. Ok so now, I\u2019m gonna go into soloists\u2026 BIBI  She\u2019s so beautiful and talented. I really like her songs, especially Kazino and Binu. She has a lot of potential. One  He\u2019s very unique, with kind of a grunge sound to his rap. Ash Island  Such a talented man. Also Jay Park trying to get him to have answers longer than one word is such a mood. Zico  Check out his new song, Summer Hate. It\u2019s really good. Actually so is the whole album. And every album of his. DPR Live  I love this guy so much. I watched his documentary about the making of his new album and it was so good. Check out the video for his song, Legacy. It\u2019s crazy good. (Also my profile pic) Gaho  Honestly on of the best voices in the whole kpop industry right now. What an icon. Lee Hi  She has a beautiful voice, personality, and visual. I hope the world treats her well because she truly deserves it EaJ  I\u2019m so hyped for his album. Him releasing the songs one by one is really killing me. Woodz  Them visuals tho. Also he is so talented. Check out the song, Buck, on his new album. And like the whole album, too. It\u2019s all so good. Kim Woo Seok  Red Moon is SUCH an underrated song. And thoooose visuals!!!! Blue.D  She doesn't even have an album out yet but she\u2019s already an icon. Check out her covers cause they\u2019re really good. Jamie  Her personality is everything to me. She also has a beautiful voice. Bewhy  He\u2019s such a good rapper. He can rap crazy fast. Check out his new album, Neo Christian. Even if you aren\u2019t Christian in any way, you\u2019ll love it. Sokodomo  I feel bad about his (kind of) scandal during High School Rapper. He is so unique and talented. The scandal wasn\u2019t his fault so I think everyone should forgive him. He\u2019s really fun to watch perform! Bol4  An amazing voice that I just couldn\u2019t turn down. Henry  So I don\u2019t agree with all his opinions, but you can\u2019t deny he\u2019s an amazing singer and a talented musician. AleXa  She is an icon. Like this girl\u2019s talent is crazy. She\u2019s serving straight visuals up and her gorgeous personality just makes her even more beautiful. Also Kitty Run is a major bop and my favorite song of hers so far. I can\u2019t wait for her next comebacks!! Chungha  Came here for Snapping, stayed for everything else. She is so good. Mino  So I know I already put Winner and since he is part of that group, I don\u2019t have to put him again, but this is just gonna be me advertising his song Okey Dokey with Zico. It is underrated. It is such a good song. It is catchy. It is iconic. You should check it out. so ya that\u2019s all who I stan. Keep in mind, that if a \u201csoloist\u201d is already in a group that I stan, I won\u2019t put them in the soloist list(other than Mino: special man, special case) a.k.a. Jennie, the members of Mamamoo, Jackson Wang, the members of Winner, the members of BTS, Woosung, the members of Stray Kids. if ya got this far, then thanks! Hope you enjoyed. Check some of these people out. It\u2019ll be worth it, trust me! ",

            "answer_text": "BTS! I love them first and always. I\u2019ve answered in a previous post why I love BTS, I will copy and paste the response again here: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014BTS is my absolute favorite. Here\u2019s why: Not to put the other groups down or anything, but BTS always has that air of sincerity and genuineness.BTS has always stated that they are musicians before anything else and their music comes before everything. Despite being international idols they are humble and modest. They don\u2019t let fame and ego get to their heads.BTS is the first group that wasn\u2019t a part of the big three (YG, SM, and JYP) to win a daesang at the MAMA Award. Their company is BigHit, which is really small compared to companies like YG which has BIGBANG, CL, G-Dragon, PSY \u2013 all super big $$$$making idols in Kpop. BTS won Artist of the Year at MAMA and also won another daesang, Album of the Year, at MMAs. That\u2019s two daesangs in just the span of one month or so. It\u2019s a really, really big deal for BTS, a group that debuted just 3 years ago, to win daesangs like that. Especially since they are not from the big three, which means they have had to rely on their own work and the work of dedicated staff to get to that level of success.Of course all Kpop groups are hardworking, no doubt \u2013 but the effort, dedication, and love put into by BTS is beyond outstanding. They stated that in their early debut days they struggled with affording meals and generally had hard time getting by because their company is so small and not as wealthy as the big three companies. And still, they didn\u2019t give up and focused on making music that they wanted to put out and worked really hard. Members like Jimin practice dancing hours, well into midnight just to get choreography right.They always talk about how much love and gratitude they have for their fans, ARMYs. Even at their acceptance speech for winning Artist of the Year at MAMA the first thing that Rap Monster said was \u201cARMY,\u201d even with all the emotions and shock going through him. These guys really appreciate their fans from the bottom of their hearts and don\u2019t take them for granted.They write a lot of their own music and are truly multitalented. Members like Namjoon (Rap Monster) and Yoongi (Suga) write a lot of their own raps and produces a vast number of songs for BTS (for example, Suga wrote/produced Tomorrow, Just One Day, Boys with Fun, Let me Know, so on). They really do put a lot of their own emotions and thoughts to share with the world. Most groups these days just sing what is given to them, but not BTS!! Additionally, Suga has released his own mixtape, with many years in the making, Agust D. If you listen to his mixtape you can see it obviously has very dark and depressing themes like depression and failure.To my next point \u2013 they sing about a lot of things that aren\u2019t typical in Kpop songs. When questioned what Bangtan Sonyeondan (Abbreviated as BTS, means \u2018Bulletproof Boy Scouts\u2019) means, J-Hope replied, \u201cThe meaning of \u2018bangtan\u2019 is to guard against something. So [our name] means that we will boldly defend our music and our value/worth.\u201d (BTS Shares What Their Group Name Could Have Been Prior to Debut | Soompi) Some lyrics to show what I mean:From their song, Am I Wrong: The world\u2019s goin\u2019 crazyAnd you? How bout ya?You think it is okay?I really don\u2019t think it is. Even with ears, there\u2019s no listeningEven with eyes, there\u2019s no seeingA fish lives in everyone\u2019s hearts.Its name is SELFISH SELFISH From their song, Baepsae: They call me a try-hard.Our generation has had it hard.Hurry, chase \u2018em.My teachers were born with it all. At my part time job, it\u2019s \u201call for experience\u201dAt school, there\u2019s the teachers.My superiors use violence.In the media they go on about \u201cthe generation that\u2019s given up.\u201d When you consider that the majority of Kpop songs today are about parties, love, having fun, generally shallow topics, these lyrics are pretty impressive. And yes, of course, BTS sings about love and having fun too, but you really don\u2019t see other groups doing what BTS is doing. Im going to stop before I go on. I can already think of more reasons on the top of my head, but I don\u2019t want this to get too long. To finish this off \u2014 DEBUT:  NOW:  They have really grown a lot and are still growing. ARMY Fighting!!!\u2764\ufe0e \u2764\ufe0e ",

            "answer_text": "I love K-Pop very much and I\u2019ve only started taking interest in it over the summer of 2018. So far I stan 3 girl groups and 5 boy groups. Although one of the boy groups are Bigbang and since the members are in military right now, I won\u2019t count them and just pretend that I only stan 4 boy groups (But my Bigbang bias is G-dragon and bias wrecker is Taeyang). Anyways let\u2019s get started. Let\u2019s start off with the girl groups. 1. Twice Twice is my favorite girl group. My biases/bias wreckers (I love both of these members so much that I cant tell which one is my bias anymore) are Chaeyoung and Tzuyu. The first ever twice music video I have ever watch was Likey. At first Jeongyeon caught my eye but as I gain more interest in Twice, I started noticing Tzuyu\u2019s humor (She\u2019e funniest in my opinion\u2026) and Chaeyoung amazing rapping skills! (Don\u2019t get me wrong, Dahyun is also great!).  2. Blackpink The first ever Blackpink music video I have ever watched was Ddu-du Ddu-du. The only reason I\u2019ve heard of it was because of this app called K-Pop starpic. There was a vote and you had to decide which song was the best. The choices were Ddu-du Ddu-du, #Cookie jar, and Heart Shaker. When I watched Ddu-du Ddu-du, the first person that caught my eye was Jennie. (mainly because she was the first one to sing\u2026) but then Lisa caught my eye (because she was the second one to sing XD) and then I started listening to the other Blackpink songs and I fell in love with the raps (Yes, I love raps)! Btw my bias is Lisa and bias wrecker is Jennie!  3. Red Velvet The first ever music video I\u2019ve watched from red velvet was #Cookie Jar (Because of that voting thing on K-Pop Starpic) and I loved it. Then I started listening to Red Flavor a lot and I KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT YERI AND SEUGI WAS GONNA BE MY FAVORITE!!! They caught my eye the first for no apparent reason and then I just well started loving then as I watched more Red Velvet videos! Seriously, they\u2019re the best\u2026 Also Yeri is my bias and Seulgi is my bias wrecker.  That was all the girl groups that I stan\u2026 Now for the boy groups. Lets start off with the obvious! 1. BTS Bts is my first ever K-Pop group that I\u2019ve taken interest in. The first ever BTS music video I have watched was Euphoria but at that time I felt like K-Pop wan\u2019t for me. Then a couple months later (In the beginning of July 2018) I started taking interest into Bts. I watched DNA and Fire and at first it didn\u2019t sound very good but as I got used to beat, I started to love them very much! V was the first member to catch my eye (Because of the part when V and Jungkook was slowly turning their heads at the camera in DNA\u2026 My brother thought V was a girl for a second). As I started taking more interest in BTS, I started liking Jimin a lot. Not because of his cheerful personality (that comes second) and not because of his talent (that comes third). The main reason I started taking interest in him is because when he smiles, his face reminds me a lot of my baby cousin and I thought that was so cute. Now my bias wreckers/biases in BTS are V and Jimin.  2. EXO I just recently got into Exo last month (October 20, 2018) and I LOVE THEM!!! The first ever music video I have watched from EXO was Ko Ko Bop. At first I only liked the part when the song went \u201cIt goes down now baby\u201d but just like DNA and Fire, as I got used to the beat, I started to love the song! My bias is Beakhyun and my bias wrecker is Chanyeol. Also this is when I made Chanyeol my bias wrecker. Don\u2019t judge me.  3. Got7 The first song that I\u2019ve listened to that was by Got7 was Just Right. For a week that was the only Got7 song I listened to but then I told myself that I have to like more K-Pop songs so I listened to Look and i fell in love with it right away. Got7 was most likely that group that I had the most trouble with deciding who was my bias\u2026 At first I really liked Youngjae. Then I started to like Yugyeom . Then it was Jackson. Then I started taking interest in Bambam. Then Mark. Then Jb and Jinyoung\u2026 Now it\u2019s between Jb, Jinyoung, and Mark. (Too lazy to get a picture of Mark so here\u2019s a pic of the Jb and Jinyoung).  4.Stray Kids This group is not as popular as the other groups but I LOVE THEM!!! The first Stray Kids member I\u2019ve seen was Hyunjin from the Idol Room videos with Got7. I started taking a HUGE interest in Stray Kids and now my bias is Hyunjin and my bias wrecker is Lee Know.  Edit: My Blackpink bias wrecker is now Jisoo. Edit 2: I read this over and I cringed! I fixed all the mistakes though. Please tell me if ya\u2019ll see any other mistakes. Thanks! And sorry for the cringe. Edit 3: I stan Momoland now. Bias is Yeonwoo and I don\u2019t have a bias wrecker yet. ",

            "answer_text": "My Favorite K-pop group is none other than EXO because it is the first K POP group I got introduce I started listening their songs since 2016. I listen all of their songs. Now I am multifan but still EXO is my favorite.All of their songs are good but my favorite are XOXO, Love me Right, Monster, Overdose, Kokobop and Forever. They are different from other idols. They are special,perfect, be themselves, charming, glowing, amazing, fantastic, good looking and unique in their own ways. Thier vocals are really strong specially Baekhyun voice is so sweet and charming that you want to hear it again and again.  The 2nd group which I like is BTS because I love their songs the most and find them the most interesting. Their songs are really good with deep and touching lyrics; their lyrics are really inspiring that you want to hear them again and again. They always dance so perfectly and they're so synchronized with their dances. Tae is my bias and I love, LOVE his deep voice.  ASTRO I start liking Astro Because of Cha Eun Woo but all members are good looking and very talented. The boys are very hard working and work together for what they want. Love making people happy and try to make each other happy. Thinks of the fans and always want to do stuff for them.  NCT I start liking NCT Because of Taeyong good visual and Mark cheerful personality. NCT has really impressed me with their music as all thier releases being completely different from eachother. From the interesting unique beat of 7th Sense to the adorably catchy vibe of Chewing Gum, NCT has music to draw in all types of Kpop fans. Not only their main singles but NCT 127s album with the title of the same name includes songs made during pre debut which are just as catchy NCT is more diverse group. With members from America, Canada, Thailand, China, Japan and Of course Korea, surely their plans as a successful global group is prominent. NCT is fresh, dynamic and it\u2019s good to see brand new faces.  Got7 I like Got7 because some of thier songs are good.What I love about them it\u2019s their personalities, they have really strong individual personalities when K-pop tends to create a character for each members, I fell for their natural personalities and behaviours. Even though they are young, they all sound very mature and can talk about their own experiences and feelings in a very mature way.  Shinee of course the main reason to like them is their songs which are awsome. Another thing I really love about them is their presence and humour whether onstage or on a reality show. They're always honest and they never fail to make me laugh when watching any one of their shows.  Seventeen When I first heard about Seventeen , the word * self producing idols * caught my attention . I haven't seen many idols who compose their songs as well choreograph tbh. So I was interested in them. Of course that was all before I stanned them. They are awesome and they work super hard. It makes me a proud carat. Its really something I love and admire because it makes them different than any other artists.  Wanna One I start liking Wanna one when i heard song Energetic; I really like this song. then i hear other song and watch variety shows, videos they are so adorable and cute. They are good looking and What made me love them was their funny antics. especially Kang Daniel and Ong Seongwoo they loves to make people laugh. they are satisfied himself every time they makes people smile.  Infinite I first learn about this group through drama Hi School love on I really like this drama and search this group and find them amazing. I like them because of their synchronized dancing. Woohyun vocals are no joke! They are good looking and their songs are great.  Btob I like Btob because they are talented, hardworking, they're very funny, they have been featured in many variety shows. some of their songs are really good.  SF 9 I got into SF9 through thier song O Sole Mio. This song is really good and one of my favorite. Their songs are really unique with catchy lyrics. they are excellent dancers, amazing vocalists, and powerful rappers. They are often praised for their complex and jaw-dropping choreographies. The boys often showed their own versions of legendary K-pop songs like growl, I need you and their dance covers gained them great popularity. They are really talented.  ",

            "answer_text": "To be very honest, I'm a huge multi stan (shocker, as if my name didn't give that out) but on a serious note I stan a lot of groups that if I was this serious about my studies, I'd honestly be Albert Einstein smart. Even though I'm relatively new to kpop having gotten into them late last year, I've honestly come across many talented groups, bands and solo artists. I'm starting from my ultimate kpop group. 1. Ateez  My best rookie group!!! Now, I know they're rookies and all and they're just beginning their career, like they haven't even been around for a year but these guys completely and passionately stole my heart. I don't know what it is about them that I just love so much, maybe its the way they perform, the energy and vibe they radiate in both MVs and on stage, the vocals, the synchronized dances, their personalities, the visuals! Or maybe because I'm a 4th generation kpop fan (yes, I dared to say that) and I basically started with them from their pre-debut, I just have this special connection with them! Everything about them seems so alluring. I'm totally whipped for them and you can't imagine how excited I must be for their comeback! My bias is our one and only Korean Big Minion, leader Hongjoong! He's really amazing in every way possible that I can't even begin to count. The other members are my bias wreckers, Every. Single. One! They all bias wreck me so bad I'm actually considering it illegal. Moving on! 2. Exo  They were my first love in kpop! If not for them, I don't think I'd have gotten into kpop as much as I'm in now. The first time I heard their song, \u2018Monster', the inner detective in me arose that I immediately went to the web and learnt all their names and other information written about them on kpop profiles within five minutes. I never knew I could store so much information in my brain during that time frame. The vocals, the visuals, the way they moved just enticed me and I fell for them instantly. Had it been I hadn't yet found Ateez they'd have been my ultimate group. 3. Bts  I'm sure some expected them to be on the list. As happy as I am to admit, I'm a proud Army. All their songs spoke to me in with completely different meanings. It amazes me how they connect songs they did years ago with their present ones, telling a story in one way or the other. The only reason they weren't no.1 is because I get confused sometimes (let me finish, don't come at me!) Like I said before, I got into kpop late last year, so you can imagine the amount of catching up I'd need to do if I wanted to understand the song connection they had years ago with their present songs. That's a lot! Plus the theories, I'm not smart enough to understand them, start connecting the dots with the small hints they've dropped in their previous MVs, I'd have to go wayyy back, notice the trivial things and start coming up with theories. I know some may be able to do this but have I mentioned how lazy I am? You can't even begin to comprehend. I give up on the littlest things if I can't do something on my first few trials, I drop it. Its a bad habit of mine but what can I do... But other than what I mentioned I love them! My bias is Taehyung and bias wrecker is Kookie!!! (Lowkey chanting Vkook) 4. Ikon  This group of crackheads is what I live for oml!!!! I found out about them earlier this year and one thing I noticed in them before listening to their music is how extremely funny, laid back and down to earth they are! Honestly I just watch some of their clips and my day immediately brightens! They're my daily dosage of happy pills and don't even get me started on their music! Killing me, the first of their songs I listened to legit killed me! This is one thing I love about kpop, its not only about the vocals, the visuals, the dance but the instrumentals are important too and Ikon has never failed to give me the best. I honestly love them and their songs! Though I miss the crazy Ikon but the sentimental ones too do justice to my taste! My bias is Bobby and bias wrecker(s) are B.I and Jinhwan though Junhoe (June) gets me too! 5. NCT  NCT is everything I could ask for! Honestly the diversity in this group seriously gets me. Plus their sub units are what makes the group so special. They've been climbing up my best kpop groups ever since I discovered them. My bias is Taeyong and bias wrecker, the whole NCT Dream and 127, plus NCT U and Way V! 6. A.C.E  This group right here is what I call an underrated one! For real after discovering them weeks ago with their latest comeback \u2018Undercover', I can't believe how much they've actually grown on me. I actually beat myself about just discovering them now and even though I'm still learning things about them, I have just four words to say, \u2018DON'T SLEEP ON THEM!\u2019 they're really talented! My bias is Jun nd bias wrecker(s) are the rest of the group! 7. Seventeen  Seventeen releases too many bops I can't begin to count. In my opinion(MY opinion) I feel they're underrated. All their songs I've listened to are so good! Honestly people should stop sleeping on them. I don't even have a bias coz I can't decide. They're all my bias!!!!! Much love from me to them! 8. Oneus  Yeeeep!!!! Have I said their latest comeback is a bop?!! Well, I'm saying it now, their latest comeback, \u2018Twilight\u2019 is a bop!!! Though they're also new to the K-pop industry, they hold a place in my heart. Bias wrecker Leedo and bias wrecked by all!!! Other honorable mentions (coz I'm too lazy to continue) Stray Kids Got7 Big Bang Day6 N.Flying Vixx Nuest Super Junior Twice Mamamoo CLC (G)-Idle KARD Pentagon Wanna One(although they disbanded, I still love them dearly!) The Boys etc I don't really have much gg I stan and I'm sure y'all noticed, but bg are more my style for reasons we all know, but I admit gg are soo good and I listen to their songs but apart from the ones on the list, I don't stan just like their songs(MY opinion). Also most of groups I stan are mostly new groups or not too old ones and again like I said I'm a 4th generation kpop stan, I'm still new and still learning old kpop groups but to really stan has been a problem. I hope I didn't bore y'all with this longg rant ",

            "answer_text": "his is based on their music and that\u2019s it. Not based on the members, performances or anything else. Just the music. Btw i\u2019m a bg stan so don\u2019t expect ggs. 1.Ateez  Their music is so unique. I mean they started with their debut album which was tropical house and if you listen to their latest album(Action to Answer) you will see a big difference. Plus they can go from songs like Illusion to Wonderland. All i want them to do is a song that is really sad. Something like Spring Day by BTS or Insomnia by Eui Jin. They are just rookies and already make such great music! They are my ult group and i love them so much. Fav title track: Say my name Fav b side: Better 2.Seventeen  They are so versitile in their music. Because they are self made, it kinda gives this feeling of connection with the artist. Also, the idea with the teams(Hip Hop, Vocal, Performance) give more diversity into their discography and i feel like there is a song for everyone. Amazing group. 10/10.Would recommend. Fav title track: Thanks Fav b side: Kidult 3.TXT  I was debating whether they should be nr 3 or 4,but their music is so good. First off, their title tracks started to go from happy and rainbows(Crown) to killing eachother with tomatoes (Can\u2019t you see me), while going through a Harry Potter phase(Run Away). Their title tracks are really good and high quality. Their b sides are either happy and cute(Blue orangeade, Drama, Poppin\u2019 Star) or ethereal and magical(Eternally, Fairy of Shampoo, Our Summer, Magic Island). They throw some spice in the mix as well(Cat and Dog, Roller Coaster, Puma). 10/10.They are talented fairies. Fav title track: Can\u2019t you see me Fav b side: Poppin\u2019 Star 4.Stray Kids  People call it construction music, i call it \u201cdifferent\u201d. Their music is so distinguishable compared to other kpop groups. I mean, how many boy groups can pull off a song like God\u2019s Menu? It helps a lot that 3Racha are main producers for their music. It give this authentic feel to them. Of course, their music isn\u2019t for everybody, but for me it\u2019s really good and high quality. They are also pretty versitile, having cute songs like Get cool and Awkward silence, sad songs like Hellevator, Levanter and Voices and songs with a rock undertone like Boxer, Grr and Awaken. Fav title track: Levanter Fav b side: Phobia 5.SF9  Definition of versitility. All their title tracks are different and unique. None of them sound like each other. Their b sides are such high quality. They put so much work into their music it\u2019s crazy. RPM is such a masterpiece of an album. Everybody needs to listen to it at least once. 10/10.Please give them a try. They are so talented. Fav title track: Summer Breeze Fav b side: Echo/Round and Round 6.Day6 (what a coincidence)  Do i have to explain myself? Literally everybody says their discography is gold and it\u2019s true. They have music for everyone and every emotion(sad, happy, angry, you name it). I listen more to their sad music but their other stuff is just as good. Everybody needs to listen to Moonrise. Amazing album. Fav title track: Time of our life Fav b side: Afraid 7.NCT  The thing that they did with the sub units is really smart music wise. I mean you got cuter music with Dream, weirder and different with 127 and edgier with WAYV.And NCT U is pretty diverse. I am not that much into Dream. Don\u2019t really vibe with their music that much tbh. Still good, won\u2019t deny that. WAYV\u2019s b sides aren\u2019t that interesting (for me!!! ), but i love their title tracks. 127 is amazing. I love them so much. So that\u2019s why they are lower. Cause i don\u2019t vibe with some of their music. But they are still amazing and high quality. Fav title track: Simon says Fav b side: Not alone 8.BTS  They used to be my ults but i\u2019ve fallen out of love a bit. Their music quality has started to decline since LY:Her. Title track wise, it\u2019s the most noticeable. I mean comparing the mastepiece that is BS&T to On\u2026you kinda notice it. Their b sides have stayed the same in quality, some actually are better. If it weren\u2019t for the b sides, MOTS:7 would\u2019ve been my least fav album, but it\u2019s my fav. I still love them a lot. Not as much as before but they hold a special place in my heart. Fav title track: Spring Day Fav b side: Best of me 9.ONF  Underrated yet so talented. Just check out their title tracks and you will fall in love with them instantlly. Not gonna say anything else. Keeping the suspense up. ;)) Fav title track: We must love Fav b side: I do 10. A.C.E  Underrated, yet so talented. They\u2019re kinda like NCT 127 and Stray Kids. Their music isn\u2019t for everyone but if you are a fan of those groups, you will for sure love A.C.E. They\u2019re at 10 because they don\u2019t have that much music. They have put out 2 mini albums but they mostly make singles(Cactus, Callin\u2019, Stand by you). They would\u2019ve been higher if they had more music. Still love them. Fav title track: Savage Fav b side: So sick And that\u2019s it. Love all of them,stan all of them. Bye ",

            "answer_text": "By the way, I love all of the groups that I\u2019ve listed below and I am not a hater to any K-pop group. I am not trying to be mean to people who don\u2019t see their bias group, but I am being as truthful as I can. ALSO: I would like to say that I am not including soloists in the list. As a Korean, I have to say that the biggest group in Korea right now is EXO. I mean, BTS is everywhere nowadays, but they aren\u2019t as popular as overseas fans think that they are in their home country. BTS hasn\u2019t been on as many variety shows or dramas as EXO has, even though we\u2019re including all of EXO\u2019s scandals that put them on hold for a while. When Kris left, it was shocking, but the album sales were still there and they still went on variety shows and such. I don\u2019t know about anybody else, but I can\u2019t imagine that BTS would still continue promoting their album if a member had just left. True, if someone left a seven-member group, it would be much more noticeable than if someone left a twelve-member group, but I\u2019m keeping in mind that they still had booming sales and couldn\u2019t do anything when THREE members left. If I had to ask a random person in the streets of any city in Korea a question about this matter, I would ask them, \u201cHey, you know that song \u2018Growl?\u2019\u201d Their answer 90% of the time would be \u201cyes.\u201d But if I asked a random person on the street about \u201cHey, you know that song \u201cBlood, Sweat, and Tears?\u201d then there\u2019s an 80% chance that they would know it. But that\u2019s the current boy group. Internationally, I think that BlackPink is more popular. However, Twice is the real hit. They are freaking everywhere, and I\u2019m starting to think that JYP doesn\u2019t allow the girls to sleep. Like, at all. If you\u2019re going to ask someone about K-pop, at least to a middle school boy, they will be like, \u201coh, you mean Twice?\u201d I can count all of the variety shows that BlackPink has been on with my fingers. Like, they haven\u2019t really done anything besides go to seven shows and release five songs. As for Twice, well\u2026 they may as well be insomniacs. That\u2019s for the newest generation. Before EXO, it was SHINee, Super Junior, and Big Bang. Before those three, it was TVXQ. Before TVXQ, it was Sechskies and h.o.t. Seriously. Apparently, in the time of Sechskies and h.o.t., there were fan-wars that were nastier than today\u2019s. Before Twice, it was SNSD. No question. SNSD\u2019s sales were off the chart, and everyone knew about them. You don\u2019t see that many 2NE1 or Twice or BlackPink diet secrets in the major Korean websites. You\u2019ll see the IU diet, which is very well-known, and then the SNSD work-outs. And if it was 2010, you\u2019d see a lot about T-ara. There were several groups that almost got popular and very possibly could have been huge. Loveliez, after \u2018Ah-choo,\u2019 were seriously a big hit, but the company didn\u2019t manage them well and they died down pretty quickly. And get this: At one point, FT Island were a bigger hit than SNSD. But then their company, FNC Entertainment, kind of screwed them over by sending them to Japan too early and that made them lose pretty much all of their popularity in Korea. By the time they finished promoting in Japan, the Korean public forgot about them. However, Lee Hongki (main vocal) is gaining some headway nowadays. But before SNSD became super popular, Wonder Girls were the stars. \u201cIrony\u201d and \u201cTell Me\u201d are two of their debut songs, and that caught the audience\u2019s attention pretty quickly. Sohee\u2019s \u201cOmona!\u201d was thing back then, just like how everyone had SNSD\u2019s \u201cOh, oh, oh, oh,\u201d as their ringtone when the Oh! album was released. And I haven\u2019t done TVXQ enough justice here. h.o.t. and Shinhwa had just left the K-pop bandwagon when they debuted, so they were faced with many awaiting eyes, and they did rise. They did pretty everything everywhere after \u2018Mirotic.\u2019 Only up until the remaining two members drafted into the military did their popularity really die down. Yeah, they were met with some backlash after JYJ left SM, but not as hard as until they literally couldn\u2019t do anything for two years. So right now: EXO, Twice Back then: Wonder Girls, TVXQ, Umm\u2026 still super popular but can\u2019t put them in a label: SNSD, Big Bang Popular at their peak: SHINee, Super Junior, 2NE1, Brown Eyed Girls, KARA Were super popular but then died down after they disbanded or something: Sistar, IOI, FT Island, T-ara, Beast, 4Minute, Infinite, Miss A, 2pm, Girl\u2019s Day (No kidding, Beast and Miss A were EVERYWHERE in 2010. People considered calling them legends right from their debut.) Upcoming legends that are too new or something to be on the list: BTS, Seventeen, GOT7, BlackPink, Wanna One, Red Velvet, GFriend, NU\u2019EST Groups you think are popular but not as popular in Korea compared to overseas: f(x), NCT ",

            "answer_text": "This is not hard: TVXQ. They've got it all. (I have seen many K-POP groups including Wonder Girls, Girls' Generation, EXO, BTS, BoA, Super Junior, HyunA, GD & TOP, f(x), Red Velvet, and Junsu, Yoochun, and Changmin live -some of them even multiple times-, and have come to that conclusion.) No one in Kpop has beat them yet when it comes to being good in all important entertainment categories: Looks: without plastic surgery (!) like most other groups these days, they rose to fame in 2005~2008. Although Jaejoong has had a nose job when he left SM (2010), before that, they were all PS-free, and SM entertainment was even praised for it.Jaejoong in 2008 was called \u201cThe Prince of Asia\u201d due to his superior looks and behaviour. His early stage name was Hero.  Yoochun (a.k.a. Micky):  Yunho (a.k.a. U-Know, the leader of TVXQ):  Junsu was called \u201cAngel\u201d because he was cute in person (even to male MCs), on TV and on moving pictures (photos are not good enough to show his cute side). His stage name is XIA:  Changmin (a.k.a. Max, the youngest):  Singing: TVXQ was known as the group with the harmonic voices that pulls off live performances so well that they sound even better than on CD. The best male signing idol group in K-Pop. Junsu and Jaejoong are regularly at no#1 and #2 on lists of best male voices in South Korea (judged by music experts). Changmin is also always in the top 10 of such lists.    XIA Junsu is a born singer (explanation: in the following video, he is sad because he is singing old Japanese hit songs of TVXQ in 2014 although he has left the group in 2010 together with Jaejoong and Yoochun with whom he created the trio JYJ):  Hero Jaejoong (the one in the center in the following two videos):    Max Changmin, the youngest one, is known as the high note champion in Kpop. He\u2019s pulled off his high notes every single time and never misses them:   Micky Yoochun is famous for his husky voice:   Stage presence: During SM Town, A-Nation, MAMA, or any other joint concert, TVXQ owns the stage. They are so dominant, professional and eye-catching when you see them in person even if you don't know them. (I did not expect Changmin to wow me the most during SM Town 2015 in Osaka - he performed solo and beat out all other SM groups that night.) Compared to most groups nowadays, TVXQ sang live even though they had to dance too. They had very nice breathing techniques to keep that up.   (Try that, rookies of today!) Languages and the Japanese market: It is no secret that TVXQ and JYJ are still huge in Korea, China and especially in Japan. They sell out within seconds. JYJ does not even promote nor do marketing nor appear at music shows at all, and still sells out. These five are the Kpop group with the best Japanese language skills on average. While other groups didn't botter learning Japanese (looking at you, EXO), these five put in their little free time they had into properly learning it so that they could communicate with their Japanese fans. Yoochun is also fluent in English. (I can speak Japanese too.)Fame and Records: Before TVXQ and BoA, K-Pop was only popular in South Korea. Then, both expanded to Japan and China, and pathed and easened the way for many many groups to follow. Once they made it in Japan (=the second largest music market in the world), they made K-Pop mainstream in East Asia. Read more here TVXQ in Guinness World Record For the 2nd Time , and here Celebrating 10 Years of TVXQ in Japan: 10 Fun Facts You Didn't Know About Tohoshinki , and here Question: How popular were DBSK before they broke up? *this made me cry*Stalkers: I won't go into detail here since it's negative to have stalkers and not something to be praised for, but TVXQ had the worst stalkers ever of any East Asian group. Once Jaejoong asked G-Dragon in 2006/7 if Big Bang also had a problem with sasaengs, and GD answered with \u201cWhat are sasaengs?\u201d. This is a good read: Sasaeng Fans . Yunho even got poisoned once by an anti-fan! Musical: Junsu is the musical actor with the best ticket selling power in South Korea. Whenever he is acting in a musical, it sells out immediately. (When watching this video, mind that he did not have any plastic surgery ever!)  Drama: Yoochun and Jaejoong are one of the most famous South Korean actors. Yoochun has starred in hit-dramas like Rooftop Prince, Sungkyungkwang Scandal, Missing You, Three Days, and movies like Sea Fog and Lucid Dream. Jaejoong has starred in dramas like Protect the Boss, Triangle and SPY. Yoochun is very good at acting!Dance: even though they're \u2018old\u2019 compared to EXO or BTS, they have the advantage of having practiced for many years. Junsu and Yunho are excellent dancers.XIA Junsu:   U-Know Yunho:  U-Know Yunho from 2:00 onward:   U-Know Yunho and Max Changmin:  Discography: no one in K-Pop can beat TVXQ when it comes to the amount of high quality Korean and Japanese singles and albums released by them since their debut in 2005.Videography: same goes for the countless Japanese and Korean MVs, show appereances, drama starring and TVXQ's own shows. Quora is not enough to list everything, even I don't know it all.Collaborations: The five men have had many collaborations with other Korean and Japanese artists like:Koda Kumi  XIA Junsu & Big Bang Taeyang:  Max Changmin and Taeyeon (from 5:00 onward):  SMAP (TVXQ is wearing white clothes here, SMAP black):  Tablo  Flowsick  Super Junior, Dok2, or even Western artist like Quincy or Kanye West (although I disliked the latter one). Ayumi Hamasaki, the queen of J-Pop, is also a big fan of TVXQ (they're called Tohoshinki in Japanese).  If you don't know Ayumi Hamasaki, Koda Kumi or SMAP, that's a different topic. Genres: most groups only focus on one genre. TVXQ though is ballad, Pop, RnB, Rock, Rap, Musical\u2026       Even if you may not like their songs, you can notice the diversity in styles and genres. Luxury, poverty and generosity: Jaejoong and Junsu come from really poor families. Although they're super-rich now (Junsu even built a hotel on Jeju Island), they never forgot where they come from. They've (sometimes secretly) donated many hundreds of thousands of \u20a9 to charity projets around the globe. The list is super-long: Charitable Contributions by JYJ and Fans .  Junsu also created FC Men, a soccer team composed of actors, singers, models and idols, that plays charity matches. He is the captain. Other (former) players include Seungri (Big Bang), Yoseob & Doojoon & Gikwang of BEAST, Kim Hyun Joong (SS501), Woohyun (INFINITE), and JUNO (Junsu's twin brother).  Personalities and friendship: TVXQ is known for their good personalities on and off-screen and for the friendship within the group which was not fake or \u201cbusiness only\u201d. The five had split up in 2010, and have suffered from not being allowed to see each other because of SM Entertainment (long story\u2026). They were like true brothers. I've actually only seen such a pure friendship in one other group: BTS. JYJ has even written songs for the remaining two TVXQ-members.  Jaejoong and Yoochun have huge tatoos on their bodies reading \u201cTVXQ\u201d. They never wanted to abandon the group and all three still love TVXQ to the core.   No other Kpop-group, no matter if BTS or EXO, has beat TVXQ yet. EXO had the chance to do so, but their popularity got damaged after some EXO members left SM for the same reason as JYJ. Maybe BTS will surpass them, who knows, BUT first they must heavily improve their live singing and further widen their discography and filmography. Then maybe, yes. If TVXQ were still five, they'd dominate today's YouTube Kpop-scene without a doubt. Enjoy~ _______________ P.S.: TVXQ was also the first K-Pop group to be featured in anime openings/endings.   ",

            "answer_text": "Bangtan Soneyeondan or BTS is and (I believe) will remain as my favorite K-Pop band. :\u2019)  But for me K-pop didn't start from BTS. Initially about 3 years back, I was introduced to Kpop and listened to SS501,Shinee,Big Bang,EXO etc. All of them were really cool and some of their songs still remain as my favorites. SS501\u2019s \u201cBecause I\u2019m Stupid\u201d is really special to me because it was the first time that a song of completely different language touched my heart.Same with the songs of Big Bang and EXO-I loved listening to them but there was something missing.I felt some void in there even though I enjoyed to their tunes.And guess who filled that in? Of course BTS. I really do not want to sound cliche but BTS made me FEEL. I would become overwhelmed at their tunes, amazed at their lyrics and could literally feel my heart flowing with emotions. They struck chords at my heartstrings when no other kpop group could do. It was not \u201clove at first sight\u201d,but I got definitely victimized by their charm at first sight! My top favorite tracks are :Spring DayI need YouRunMagic ShopAnswerTeaching us to \u201cLove Yourself\u201d. The most endearing reason of why I support them and why I would fight for them. There has been lot of songs about heartbreaks,love,agony of parting,insomnia etc.But tell me how many are there where they teach you to love yourself?How many are there where they as you to discover your true honest self?How many are there that teach us to face our difficulties so that we can overcome them with all our might? One ,two?Very few to be precise. BTS concentrated on mental issues ,trauma,bullying and wrote the lyrics of their song breaking all societal dogmas.You\u2019ve shown me I have reasons I should love myself I\u2019ll answer with my breath, my path The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow (I\u2019m learning how to love myself) With no exceptions, it\u2019s all me Maybe there\u2019s no answer Maybe this isn\u2019t the answer either It\u2019s just that loving myself Doesn\u2019t require anyone else\u2019s permission I\u2019m looking for myself again But I don\u2019t wanna die anymore Me, who used to be sad Me, who used to be hurt It\u2019ll make me more beautiful Lyrics. They write lyrics straight from their hearts. You would feel a part them inside the tunes they sing. Most of the songs are written by Namjoon ,Suga and some by V. The song Magic Shop and Spring Day is too beautiful to exist.I will quote a part of Suga\u2019s rap in Magic Shop: So I was always impatient and anxious Comparing myself became a daily thing My greed that used to be a weapon Became a prison and noose But looking back, to be honest I don\u2019t think I wanted to be the best I wanted to be someone\u2019s comfort I wanted to touch someone\u2019s heart I want to take away your sadness, your pain. My heart races at this part. The song is totally about asking yourself to free those shackles of pain ad sorrow From nothing to achieving so much. Even after years it pains me to think that their debut stage wasn't their own and it was a replacement of someone else. They were constantly demotivated,constantly told to give up saying they wouldn't make it far. But look how far we came. :) I came across a picture yesterday of how BTS would sell free tickets in the beginning and now they get sold out within minutes.I could go on and on about them but I\u2019ll stop right here. An Army. ",

            "answer_text": "I have 4 ults: Twice, (G)I-DLE, Mamamoo and Itzy. But if you are asking for my ult ult, it would be Twice.  At first, I hated on them because i thought they were too cute and that Like Ooh-Ahh was a terrible song. I hate myself for that now. It isnt their fault that they need too be cute. Anyway, I started stanning them after they released Likey. I still think it was too cute. But I still liked it. No idea why. Enough of the introduction. Here\u2019s why I like Twice: Their determination.Even with all the critism, they arent really affected. Special Mention 1: Momo Despite being eliminated from SIXTEEN, Momo still persisted on. I still wouldnt say she is good at vocals like the rest though. I hope she can prove me wrong. Special Mention 2: Mina Yep. Mina. Despite overcoming her depression/anxiety, she still participated in feel special. Get Well Soon Penguin! 2. Their Personalities. Each member has their different personalities and I think that that is the wonderful thing about them. Lets start from the oldest to the youngest. Nayeon: Cute bunny. A bit gay too. Jeongyeon: Mom Momo: Funny Sana: Cutie Sexy (and gay) Jihyo: Godly. Mina: Perfect Dahyun: Do I really need to explain? Chaeyoung: Fierce baby tiger Tzuyu: Quiet, savage. \ud83d\udc9c 3. Their love for fans. Remember the time when Jihyo ran from her bodyguard just to greet fans? That was awesome. 4. Their underrated dance skills Their dance skills are really good. Sadly, their choreography is considered too easy because they want Onces to also dance with them. That doesnt mean they dance badly. A video of our dance queen Momo:  5. Their underrated Vocal skills. Jihyo didnt train for 10 years just to be critisised, did she? Most definately not.  6. Their underrated rap skills. Not all Twice members can rap, but Chaeyoung can. Dahyun can. Momo can. And they are amazing.  7. Their underrated Visuals. They have many things that are underrated, dont they? Dont worry this is the last one. Lets bless your eyes. (Not by age its by random) btw sorry for the choice of pictures i just love happy happy and breakthrough era too much Starting with the visual herself, Tzuyu:    (she looks good with bangs) Next for the most underrated visual queen, Jihyo:    Beautiful. No wonder we call her a god. Next for the cute unnie, Nayeon:    No wonder she loves herself. Next, the girl who looks good with short hair but even better with long hair, Jeongyeon:    Woah that stare pierced my heart. Next for the unofficial visual of the group, at least in my opinion, Sana:    Cheese Kimbap, anyone? Next for the Black Swan, Mina:    BONUS PIC TO WISH A SPEEDY RECOVERY:  Whats with that face, Minari? Next for the baby tiger:    Why do you like staring at me just like Jeongyeon? Jkjk Now for Momoring:    Also another underrated one. What better way to end of with the tofu? Thats right, Dahyun is coming your way.    What I love most is her confidence. Now for a group picture:  Did I spam too many pictures? Nevermind its twice anyway. 8. Their fanbase. For once, lets not talk about twice. Get it? For Once? ok fine im gonna be serious. I admit, some Onces are really toxic, but which group doesnt have toxic fans? Onces are very supportive of Twice and they love twice. Thats why i think the fanbase is also something good about twice. 9. Their hardworkingness Is there such a word? Hardworkingness? Anyway, Twice is very hardworking. 2018 had comebacks. 2019 had 2 Korean MVs and 2 Jaoanese MVs. Even with Mina at this state. Give these girls a break, people. Hope you enjoyed! Thanks for reading!  Stream Feel Special! And STAN TWICE Bye! ",

            "answer_text": "Well I\u2019m a bit confused with your question. But looking at others\u2019 answers, I\u2019ll just explain why I love my ultimate groups. Lezzgeddit Btw this is long 0u0 My ultimate group is NCT. NCT 127\u2019s Regular got me into Kpop, and I officially started getting into NCT after hearing Kick It by NCT 127. Here are basic reasons why I love NCT so much: Amount of content. They have 4 subunits, so there\u2019s going to be a lot of content. SM promotes NCT really well these days, with things like Aswaz and other \u201cepisodes\u201d where the members play games and interact with each other. The number of songs they put out is also a lot because they promote separately in units.All-rounder group. NCT is undoubtedly one of the most all-rounded, if not THE most all-rounded, K-pop group out there. SM hit the jackpot with members like Mark, Taeyong, Haechan, Jaehyun, Ten, and more. Who are some of the most all-rounded idols in K-pop.Different = Special and Unique. NCT has this unique \u201cunlimited member\u201d concept. But it isn\u2019t just that concept that is different. NCT 127 has concepts in songs like Cherry Bomb, Simon Says, Firetruck, etc. that no other group could possibly pull off. The 7th Sense by NCT U also has a complex concept that is neither cute, heavy, or sensual. It\u2019s just what it is. NCT is not afraid to try new things and I like that about them.4 Kings of dance in one group. Taeyong, Ten, Mark, and Jisung are all very well-known outside of our fandom as 4 of the best dancers in K-pop. Self-explanatory.My second ultimate group is EXO. I got into EXO out of curiousity. I heard Love Shot early on when I started getting into Kpop, but never actually went farther than that. Based on my love for Love Shot, I decided to give EXO a shot. Monster was the real banger that made me love EXO so much. But here are basics: Vocals. I REPEAT. VOCALS. 3 of the best K-pop vocalists of all-time. Baekhyun, Chen, and D.O. But the group overall is very vocal based. All have achieved a certain level of vocal skill, it\u2019s just some are better than others. Suho and Xiumin are also very talented vocalists. They have many vocal songs and members have individually participated in singing in OSTs and other vocal songs.Mr. Kim Jong In. Kai is known as one of the most charismatic dancers in the industry. When I first watched Love Shot, I thought he was the leader because of the charismatic vibes he gave off. I was shocked to learn that Suho was the leader, but now I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone but Suho having the leader position. EXO SARANGHAJA!Their rap line is actually really good. I know EXO doesn\u2019t have the most amazing rappers like Suga or Bobby, but surprisingly, Chanyeol auditioned to become a vocalist, and SM just decided to make him Main Rapper instead. He has trained so hard to make his rapping better, and I think it\u2019s paid off! His raps in songs like Obsession and Monster are fire. Sehun is also a really great rapper! And so is Kai.They\u2019ve gone through so much, but have pushed through. EXO has lost 3 members, Kris, Luhan, and Tao. Imagine the heartbreak all of the remaining members had to go through when one after another decided to leave. EXO is one of the groups with the most amount of Sasaengs. Multiple times, members have gotten hurt by fans. But you know what? They still put a smile on their face and tell us everything is OKAY. Baekhyun, Kai, and Chen have gotten loads of hate for being human. Baekhyun dated Taeyeon from SNSD in 2014. Even though Taeyeon got more hate than Baekhyun did, he still was hated on and told to leave the group. Kai dated Krystal from f(x) and Jennie from BlackPink and got tons of hate as well. Chen got married and had a daughter recently, and fans have asked for him to leave EXO. But what do they do? They smile and say they love us, when inside, they are clearly hurting. So please everyone. Love your idols, don\u2019t hate on them for things humans do. Lay, the only remaining Chinese member of EXO, has also been asked by \u201cfans\u201d to leave EXO countless times. It truly breaks my heart that these people call themselves \u201cfans\u201d. They have gotten injured so many times. But they try not to show it to make fans not worry. They risked their lives for us. I know most groups have had a hard past, but EXO had really had the toughest time. If you want to learn more and in detail, I really loved Beth Eady\u2019s answer on EXO hardships. So check her answer out here: What are the hardships EXO went through and what are the achievements they received?Anyways, sorry for the really long EXO answer. My third ultimate group is Stray Kids. I actually got into Stray Kids near the beginning of when I started liking K-pop. I specifically started really liking Stray Kids after listening to My Pace. Basics: So many good songs. Let me just list some of my favorites.My PaceDouble KnotGod\u2019s MenuEasyHellevatorLevanterSlumpetc.Another all-rounded group. Han is a main vocalist and main rapper and could be a lead dancer in another group. Hyunjin is a lead rapper and main dancer. Bang Chan is a lead vocalist, rapper, and lead dancer. Felix is a rapper and lead dancer. Changbin is the main rapper and lead dancer material. Lee Know is a main dancer and vocalist. Seungmin is a main vocalist. IN is a lead vocalist. There you go.2 Rap Gods. Changbin and Han are two of my favorite rappers in K-pop. Flow, speed, tone, facials, you name it, they got it.Hyunjin is one of the best 4th gen dancer in my opinion. His facials and charisma is what really stands out to me. His powerful style of dancing is really fun to watch, and he can also pull off less powerful dances as well. You can watch his cover for when the party\u2019s over by Billie Eilish here: Ok well hope you didn\u2019t get too bored right lol \ud83c\udf31 ~ stay green grasses ~ \ud83c\udf31 ",

            "answer_text": "Hm, well as someone who has only been into K-pop for about maybe 6 months, I would like to say that I do like different groups. (Mainly into Boy Groups though) I listen to a few of a certain group\u2019s songs, and if I like enough of them, I will download ALL their songs onto my phone, and then listen to all of them. So they group\u2019s songs have to have a nice impact on me to actually start stanning them. I also know personally that if I listen to songs to often then I WILL get bored of them no matter how good they are. So I am already into a few groups I\u2019d say (Not too much though) so that I don\u2019t get bored by any songs too quick BTS Of course, they were the group that brought me into K-pop. My friend introduced them to me, and being completely honest, I am a person who is very adaptable to different situations and all that, so I kinda forced myself to think that they were handsome (I mean, I thought they looked OK, I just wasn\u2019t exactly like, DDAENG if you know what I mean *I hate myself rn lol*), and also kinda forced myself to like them, but then I listened to more of their songs and the lyrics and was touched. So yeah, that was pretty great. Now I love them so much and they impacted a good part of my life. iKON Omigosh, I LOVE these dorks. Many of their songs are more on the upbeat side, with a few exceptions of course, but their songs are beautiful and can brighten my day. And all these guys in this groups are hilarious and funny. A good way to see this is by their self-produced self TV show, iKON TV, which is AMAZING and HILARIOUS and let me get to see more of their personalities. Amazing dudes, all of them deserve to be in that group. (I\u2019ve seen both of the survival shows they were in too, WIN: WHO IS NEXT, and Mix and Match) Pentagon All these 10 guys deserve so much. I do admit, I did join Universe (their fandom) after listening to their hit \u2018Shine\u2019 (a friend showed the song to me, and at the time, I was super picky about my Kpop songs, so I honestly only liked very few songs) and I thought it was great. After listening to more of their other songs, and seeing their more serious side of songs, I fell in love. Like on my goodness, their emotions and lyrics in some of their songs. Also, their use of Korean Culture references and stuff in their song \u201cNaughty Boy\u2019 makes it one of my favorite songs. (Actually I think it\u2019s my favorite Kpop songs ever haha) Several of their Non-Title tracks are amazing too. These guys are pretty dorky and hilarious (I\u2019ve been able to see from the couple shows I\u2019ve seen them on). I just do feel a bit bad for the rest of the members, since a lot of people left their fandom because of the E\u2019dawn and Hyuna scandal (Not really a scandal in MY, they just were dating, but it became a big thing, and hurt many members in the group). But I still stan all of the members because their videos/music is the ONLY music that will always brighten my mood, no matter how sad/depressed I am that day. And because they make me smile watching any Stray Kids I have been a fan of Stray Kids for a little less than a month by now, and can say that these dudes are worth stanning. I had already listened to a few of their songs, and I liked them, I just hadn\u2019t bothered downloading them onto my phone yet (cuz I\u2019m such a lazy bum bro, it\u2019s shameful). Then, my friend got into them, and I was like, oh well, Imma download their songs onto my phone so I can hear all they do. Was that a good decision! Sure, they have adorable songs like Get Cool and Awkward Silence, but their songs also have some deep and touching meanings. Like Voices, Grow Up, and Hellevator. Those songs are so good, and make me want to cry, dang not something I want to do in public when I have my earbuds in. I\u2019m surprised how hard they work for only being a rookie group. They released a pre debut album, which is really good, along with the rest of their albums. Also, all the members are super fun and hilarious, and get along so well. They\u2019re really a family who love each other. NCT 127 Ok, this is probably the group on my favorites that I know the least amount of, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t like them less. I just barely got into NCT 127, and I like the energy of their songs. I have listened to all their songs, and while I haven\u2019t read the translations of all their songs yet, A lot of their songs are catchy and make me happier I guess. I\u2019ve seen some videos of them on shows (not too many tho) and they all seem very wild and happy together. I like the vibe of their group, which is why I decided to keep listening to their songs. I still need to get more into them haha. Blackpink Ok, being completely honest, I would technically say I\u2019m INTO Blackpink, and sure, I LIKE their songs, and I can tell them all apart, their voices, and their songs are ok, but they aren\u2019t exactly my favorite. I am putting them on my list tho, but when I said this wasn\u2019t exactly in a certain order, but if they were, Blackpink would probably be the last on the list. I do think their songs are catchy and good, but they only have 9 songs\u2026 and I get bored of songs quick. So I listen to their songs sparingly on my phone. They seem like nice girls, but I don\u2019t really watch to many videos or shows with them in it. Still, they\u2019re pretty great. While those five groups are the ones I really got into, and love, there are other groups that I appreciate, and like a few of their songs. Dreamcatcher (dang I just love the songs i\u2019ve listened to so far, and their horror concept is super different than usual girl groups I\u2019ve listened to)Exo (I used to not really like Exo\u2019s music, but they\u2019ve really been growing on me, so yeah, I think I might try and stan them soon)Seventeen (Oof these guys are good at dancing, and seem fun. All the different songs I\u2019ve heard from them, I\u2019ve liked, so I think they\u2019re next on my list to start to stan them)Oneus (This just newly debuted group caught my attention with their song Valkyrie. I\u2019ve downloaded their debut album onto my phone, and all the songs are great. I wouldn\u2019t exactly say I stan them yet, but I want to get to know them more)WINNER (After watching WIN: WHO IS NEXT, with the intention of trying to know iKON better, I fell in love with winner and their amazing style. I wouldn\u2019t exactly say I stan them completely, but I checked them out a bit more, and all their songs I\u2019ve enjoyed so far, and they deserve being the group they are)SHINee (I\u2019ve listened to quite a few of their songs, but definitely not all. But all their songs have this\u2026 hm idonno how describe it, but this\u2026 *insert a word that means cool or something here* vibe that I like. The members seems really chill and pretty, but I don\u2019t necessarily STAN the group, even though they are great)Oof this was super long for just a thing that was like, what\u2019s your favorite group, and I went like, oo here\u2019s like five groups and here\u2019s a description about them ooh. Yeah, Imma gonna stop my ranting now. I DO like Kpop, but I do also like other types of music, not just Kpop. It\u2019s good to listen to several different types of music than just Kpop, in my opinion iodine, I kept ranting ug ok, I\u2019m going to stop now haha. ",

            "answer_text": "I am honestly such a hoe when it comes to Kpop bands I listen to and bias so many. If I had to put them down to my top 10 though I think it would go like this: 10. Twice  I\u2019m not typically a fan of bubblegum Kpop but Twice are simply too good to not stan. I\u2019ve yet to come across a song of theirs that I hasn\u2019t got caught in my head and left me singing it for days on end. Offstage they are simply the loveliest of girls and so entertaining to watch. Bias: Dahyun Favourite Song: Fancy 9. Day6  I absolutely love Day6. Their songs completely appeal to my inner 14 year old who was obsessed with rock bands. They are memorising to watch and their songs just hit real deep. Bias: YoungK Favourite song: Sweet Chaos and I Need Somebody 8. Mamamoo  My favourite Kpop girl group. They honestly produce hit after hit after hit. I fell in love with them after hearing Gogobebe last year and haven\u2019t been able to get enough ever since. Vocal Queens \ud83d\udc51 Bias: Hwasa Favourite Song: Gogobebe and Destiny 7. Big Bang  KINGS. Totally deserving of their title. They can do everything. Their stage presence is truly out of this world and their songs are all so catchy and ughhh talent. Can\u2019t wait for them to start releasing new music again. Bias: G Dragon Favourite Song: Haru Haru and If You 6. Super Junior  Love Love Love their music. Their older music gives me life and is the absolute catchiest. Their vocals slay and they can pull off any concept that comes their way. There is a reason they have remained so popular so long after their debut. Also they\u2019re all in their 30s and yet they look so young still\u2026HOW?? Funniest idols you\u2019ll ever come across. Bias: Eunhyuk Favourite song: Blacksuit and It\u2019s You 5. Ateez  My super rookies. These boys are so good it\u2019s insane. Their stage presence is one you\u2019d expect to see in a group years into the industry not rookies. They release banger after banger and I love how their not afraid to release music that doesn\u2019t necessarily fit the mainstream. Beautiful talented boys and I can\u2019t wait to see how far they get. Bias: Hongjoong and San Favourite song: Promise and Pirate King 4. NCT  21 incredibly gorgeous, hard working boys. It\u2019s impossible not to love them. All of their subunits are pure gold (although Dream is probably my favourite). Their vocals are insane and their dancing is outta this world. Bias: Haechan and Ten Favourite Song: Moonwalk and Stronger 3. EXO  The first Kpop band I ever listened to. These boys got me into Kpop and will always hold a special place in my heart. They have my favourite vocals in the entire industry and I could watch their live stages forever. So much talent, stage presence and charisma. Love them big time. Bias: Baekhyun Favourite Song: El Dorado and Thunder 2. BTS  These boys were my ult group for years. Their lyrics are inspirational and everything about them is so aesthetic and pleasing to the ear. They are the only Kpop group I have ever seen live and it was the best concert I have ever been to. They were positively memorising and their stage presence was unreal. Bias: Jimin Favourite Song: Blood Sweat and Tears and Spring Day 1. Stray Kids  My Ults. 3RACHA have a way of producing songs that hit me hard. As someone who is going through a rough patch at the moment, Stray Kids music gives me strength. Their lyrics are hard hitting and inspirational and I love everything about them. Their rap line is, in my opinion, one of the best in the industry and their stage presence is crazy from such a young group. Bias: Han Favourite Song: Sunshine, Awaken and Voices ",

            "answer_text": "BTS are the kings right now, in general, no matter how many people hate that fact it\u2019s true\u2026.enough said. Blackpink is the biggest gg popularity-wise, they're super cool and gorgeous. But from 3rd/4th generation, as many would argue and hate on me for saying this, but TWICE is the biggest gg in general and the only advantage Bp has over them is popularity but honestly that\u2019s it. I know, I know, I am OBSESSED with Rv, Bp, Mamamoo, and AOA, believe me I AM, but I got to say Twice has the potential to go to an \u201cIT\u201d legendary gg level. Ig twice gets hated on (especially internationals)because people are so used to what they see on the media which is bp/bts/exo/etc., and when they see the opposite of that which is twice they\u2019re like gross but honestly they\u2019re the most hardworking and dedicated girls you can ever see. If only people were able to see the value that they have they\u2019d understand and start to Stan them or respect what they do at least. Other groups are huge threats to them, they have soooooo much talent, i\u2019m not downgrading them whatsoever, each one is unique and different in their own ways BUT Twice has this triple threat talent and potential to go for a really long time. Other groups can go huge and they will without a doubt because they trained hard for it, they're talented and deserve it but there\u2019s something to each twice member that people hate on which is their Charisma. Twice has accomplished sooooo much WITHIN 3 YEARS and are still accomplishing, it\u2019s almost scary when you really analyze things. I mean did people think SNSD would be huge within 3 years of their careers, no and some people hated on them because there\u2019s always anti, but look at them now. People will try to hate on Twice for those same stupid reasons that they are really plain/boring/cringy/toocute/etc (which I call bullshit because their bg do the same and get no shit for it) and I get where you\u2019re coming from because I used to think the same way but I say Fuck it I give credit when credit is due, they are the IT gg of their generation (and at their pace some would say of all generations because of their accomplishments, but thats a 50/50 chance, too early for me to tell). They need to open their eyes to the reality, they won't stop hearing from Twice anytime soon like at all, no matter how much they wish that happened. I DOUBT jype will let them go on a hiatus because if he has a chance to create a gg that can go legendary level like SNSD, S.E.S, Wonder girls, 2NE1, Apink, etc., he WON\u2019T do the stupidest decision in kpop history of promoting them less or disbanding them anytime soon. And he knows it perfectly well because of the shocking accomplishments Twice has reached in such a short amount of time. He will of course keep making more groups even after Itzy but twice will always be there. I know i\u2019m saying this now and things can change in matter of seconds because we don\u2019t know the future but for now Twice is the biggest right now and will get bigger for sure. I get It when they say that they should change up a bit and tbfh I was already ughhh-ing their music 3 comebacks back but they STILL did awesome and they\u2019re so loved. They just recently changed up a bit to a more mature style/concept first with yes or yes and now officially with Fancy and I got to say it\u2019s already going amazing and I can tell that they are already stepping up their game. They showed what anti\u2019s doubted and still doubt (at one point in the beginning even me) they had which is talent. It has to happen with any group sooner or later (unless you're themed/varied and don\u2019t get hate on because of it like bts, exo, etc.) because people get bored of the same thing over and over again and if the concept change isn't as successful then that\u2019s when you know a group won\u2019t go as the biggest of the biggest because they\u2019ll start to flop. And they did AMAZING, the only ones to disagree are of course the over sensitive and picky Anti but they did so great and it fit them veeeery well. I mostly loved how they changed and were still authentic to their Twice style. People think they changed because they're afraid Itzy would de-thrown them but honestly that happens to every gg when a new gg debuts to the company, it happened with SNSD when f(x) debuted and it happened with f(x) when Rv debuted and in other companies as well, because there\u2019s always a change. Either way I think some people under appreciate Twice\u2019s worth and talent and their personalities are just a cherry to add on top of everything that they do. I just wish them the best honestly and other gg too. sorry if this offended you, since I know everyone gets triggered especially in kpop quora questions. ",

            "answer_text": "PSA: This is just my opinion so please do not get offended if I do not mention your favorite group, but feel free to comment below. Let us be peaceful and avoid fan wars, okay? I think that it would be unfair to say the best K-Pop group, because every group is different, has had different experiences and hardships, and being under different agencies may or may not be in advantage to a certain extent. Disclaimer: It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to become a K-Pop idol so to say that a group or person is not good, okay, because they have endured more than you can probably imagine. PSA2: I didn\u2019t really get into K-Pop until the 3rd Generation so I won\u2019t include groups like After School, Orange Caramel, Rainbow, 2AM, 2PM, and Shinwa. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sure these groups were amazing, but I do not feel comfortable writing about them since I do not know that much about them. I also will only mostly (or maybe all, we\u2019ll just have to see how this turns out) have boy groups since I mostly listen to boy groups. Sorry if this offends anyone. It is not my intention to offend anyone. With that being said, here are my favorite K-Pop groups and soloists: Seventeen: Seventeen is a 13 member boy group under Pledis entertainment. Okay, so why is the name Seventeen when they have 13 members? Long story short they actually were planned to have 17 members when they were part of the Seventeen Project, a program where trainees were eliminated until they reached the final lineup (this is actually very common, but it is not a widely known fact since it is not usually broadcast. Think of it like a less glorified version of Produce 101). They have now said that 17 stands for 1 group + 13 members + 3 sub-units (Performance-Dance, Hiphop-Rap, and Vocal Units)=17 total. Okay but enough behind 17. These are just a few reasons why I love Seventeen. They are self-producing idols. This means that they write their own lyrics, compose their own songs, essentially producing their own music all by themselves (of course sometimes they collaborate with other producers) and they also choreograph their dances.The unit system is very neat and it allows for each unit to be featured, therefore allowing the group to be more efficient and showcase more of their talents.They have honest and good personalities. There\u2019s not much I have to say about this but if you watch behind the scenes videos you can clearly see how much they love what they do and you can see that they are close as a group.They are so in sync! Seventeen is known for being the kings of synchronization with all of their dances as well as in real life sometimes by accident.They are diverse. They have members from China, Korea, and the United States.BTS: I almost didn\u2019t include BTS in this list just because so many people know them, and I wanted to help spread recognition to those groups who have not gained quite as much fame, yet. But BTS was the group that really got me into K-Pop so I just couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity. BTS is a very well rounded group. They can act, sing, dance, and rap. They can do all of these well, too. They are also kind and supportive and care very much about their music, fans, and about each other. They are like a bunch of brothers.They produce all of their own songs. K-Pop is a very formulated industry so there actually is not a whole lot of room for creative freedom. BTS has gone against many of the standards even if it wasn\u2019t the thing that would improve popularity (KBS has a habit of banning many things for some dumb reasons) .They are \u201crough\u201d idols. Now, please don\u2019t get offended when I say this, but BTS doesn\u2019t fit the idol stereotype. They swear on camera and they don\u2019t right about how everything is great, like the \u201cperfect\u201d idol group.They always acknowledge their fans, ARMY, first. At award shows they always thank ARMY before they give their acceptance speech. On their V-Live (a streaking app for idols), they have many iconic videos where they dedicate everything to ARMY or they worry about ARMY.Their leader, RM, learned English from watching the TV show, Friends. This isn\u2019t really group related but it\u2019s definitely cool and unique. I mean, who doesn\u2019t love a good episode of Friends?EXO: Of course if I included BTS I have to include EXO, right? Haha please don\u2019t compare or start fan wars (*cough cough* EXO-L and ARMY). They are both are different and amazing so they shouldn\u2019t be compared. They are also good friends so how do you think it makes them feel when they are friends but their fans always war? Anyways here\u2019s the list: Vocals. Okay, wow, EXO may have some of the best (or strongest) vocalists of a K-Pop group at the moment. Seriously, have you listened to EXO-CBX. Also don\u2019t trod on Chanyeol\u2019s vocals. Also those videos with CBX+D.O or Lu Han were gold. Even though he\u2019s technically a rapper that man can really sing.Kai, Sehun, and Yixing are dancing machines! There\u2019s not much I have to say about this since it\u2019s pretty self explanatory, but yeah, they are so good at dancing.Their concept is based on a story line. This is one of my favorite parts about EXO. They debuted with a story line and have, for the most part, stuck with it all these years.They really are good at variety shows. I always find that their variety shows are super funny, whether as a whole group, in units, or solo, they always manage to make the day better through laughter.EXO Showtime was one of the best things that I have watched. When the OT12 were still together they filmed a show called EXO Showtime. It was to promote cooperation as a team and let the viewers get to know them better. This was around Wolf Era (one of my favorite songs by the way) so many of the activities they did were related to the song. During the show they went to a winter sports park, played a cooperation game, went to a haunted house, and much more!Day6: Okay, so Day6 is a 5 member boy BAND under JYP Entertainment. They used to have 6 members but now they have 5. I capitalized \u201cband\u201d, because they are a band. They don\u2019t dance (oh boy, imagine Chicken Little dancing), but they play instruments and sing and rap. They often play light-rock and just have some pretty fresh and chill music overall. You should check out their weekly idol episode with N.Flying! They really put everything into their music. There are videos of them going around trying to find crickets at the park to record for one of their songs. They also used to have a comeback every single month. Now if that\u2019s not impressive, I don\u2019t know what is.They have diversity in their group. Jae, vocalist, rapper, and guitarist, was born in Argentina, but soon moved to California. Young K (Brian!), was born in South Korea, but went to High School in Canada. Jae also used to MC for After School Club.Their acoustic videos are amazing. They used to film videos while they ate dinner while they sang one of their recent songs using acoustic guitars. The drummer (and the maknae) would often make drums out of things he found on the table.Okay, now on to some less known groups, and soloists :) I won\u2019t write very much on these because I feel like this post is getting too long and I don\u2019t want to cut groups out. This does not mean these groups are any less than the one\u2019s above! The Rose: This 4 member boy band has captured my heart from the beginning. They have such a unique style of singing and their videos are so stunning! Shaun: Shaun is a soloist who I hadn\u2019t heard of until recently when he released his song \u201cWay Back Home\u201d. Now, I cannot stop listening to his songs. I highly recommend the song \u201cBad Habits\u201d. Shaun breaks the stereotypes of the typical Idol singer because his is not Ulzzang (don\u2019t roast me please). He has a powerful voice, though and he produces his own music. He was in the indie rock band Koxx and plays keyboard and DJs. Holland: Holland is the first openly gay kpop idol. He was kicked out of his company because he announced he was gay, so he started his own label so he could continue to make music. He has stunning music videos, and amazing music. K.Will: K.Will is a soloist who has been dubbed as \u201cPrince of OST\u201d. He often sings many of the OSTs for Korean Drama\u2019s and is famous for his song \u201cPlease Don\u2019t\u201d (I won\u2019t spoil it, but it is really good so please watch it!). Henry: Henry, a old member of Super Junior-M under SM Entertainment, is now a soloist. He was born in Canada and has Chinese ancestry. Before becoming a K-Pop artist, he was a violinist at Berklee College of Music in the United States. He is famous for his violin and piano skills, but he also sings and dances quite well. I highly recommend his OST, \u201cIt\u2019s You\u201d. He was also featured on the show \u201cAlways Cantare\u201d. Benji of B.I.G.: BIG is a fantastic group, but I would like to focus in on Benji because I feel as if he is highly unique. Benji was from America and went to Julliard School of Music (one of the best music schools in the world) for violin performance. He was also on the show \u201cAlways Cantare\u201d. He is famous for his violin covers of K-Pop songs.

            "answer_text": "NCT 127.  I really love every single album they\u2019ve put out. From Firetruck album to Neo Zone, there are so many songs that I love hearing and that just sound so new and interesting when I was exploring different artists discographies from so many different backgrounds and cultures. I was introduced to K-Pop in 2017, and of course while we had the huge groups like BTS and EXO that many people have heard of\u2014even if they don\u2019t like K-Pop\u2014there were so many other great groups that were just hidden under the surface, and NCT 127 was one of them. They debuted in 2016, and in 2017, I listened to Firetruck\u2014one of the first K-pop songs I had ever heard. I checked out their other two title tracks, Limitless and Cherry Bomb and I really loved their style and the way their music was structured.  NCT 127\u2019s concept is a \u2018neozone\u2019 concept, and I really think that they portray it very well in their songs\u2014most specifically their titles.  Cherry Bomb is an almost 5 minute song that dives in and out of so many genres, it goes from being synth-pop to heavy bass, slips into a quick R&B section, before having an electronic dance break instrumental in the latter half of the song. It\u2019s so interesting, complex, and has so many layers to the song that it\u2019s never a boring listen when I put it on.  One of their newer comebacks, Punch is also super interesting music-wise. It starts off with this video-game sound for around 15\u201320 seconds before going straight into a hype chorus and then into a rap verse. The structure of the song is also really different and the first time you listen to it you would be surprised at every turn the song takes, and it might take a few listens before you even fully comprehend what the song is even constructed of. All in all, Punch is another amazing song that really fits their neozone concept, without being overdone or repetitive.  Lastly, I want to talk about Superhuman. Superhuman is a song released in 2019 and is an amazing sci-fi electro-dancepop song with really gritty EDM and a catchy chorus. Everytime I\u2019ve listened to an NCT title song, I have never said \u201coh this sounds like a song I\u2019ve heard before\u201d because it all sounds so new and fresh. Especially Superhuman. It starts out with harmonies before having really glitchy sound effects and the verses are all really slow and nice on the ears. However, the chorus takes it to another level and the drop is so satisfying to hear every time.  One of my favorite American artists of all time is Twenty One Pilots and NCT 127 really reminds me of their discography. Twenty One Pilots songs can take so many twists and turns just from the verses to chorus and I always find it really stimulating and interesting to listen to. I hope to always find new and interesting songs to hear so that I will never be bored while listening, and right now NCT 127 is doing just that. I love it. From the stars, Dawn. Songs Mentioned: Cherry Bomb, Punch, Superhuman ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t just like K-pop, I love it. I also love a bunch of groups. Bare with me, as this answer will be pretty long lol Boy Groups: BTS: The first boy group I ever stanned. I got into them after their win at the BBMAs, despite listening to Dope for the first time two years earlier. (Can you believe that i thought they were generic back then? LMAO) I\u2019m glad to have gotten into them, though, for a myriad of reasons. They as a group are all very talented individuals, from their vocal line (Jimin and Jungkook sing beautifully, and so does Jin, when they bother to give him lines.) to their dance and rap lines (chock-full of rapping and dancing talent, especially on my boy Hoseok\u2019s end) , they\u2019ve got it all. Granted, they may not be as vocally qualified as EXO, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re bad in the slightest. Aside from having a great amount of talent, all of he boys are so handsome and funny. I may not be directly attracted to them, but that won\u2019t stop me from saying that I think they\u2019re gorgeous. (Especially Jin, aka Worldwide Handsome) I mean, look at this.  Jung Hoseok/ J-Hope/ Hobi, age 24. Member of Rap and Dance lines.  Kim Taehyung/V/Tae, age 22. Member of the Vocal line.  Park Jimin, 22, Member of the Vocal and Dance lines.  Jeon Jungkook, 20, Member of the Vocal and Dance Lines.  Min Yoongi/Suga, 25, member of the Rap Line.  Kim Seokjin/Jin, 25, member of the Vocal Line.  Kim Namjoon/RM, 23, member of the Rap line. Did you feel your soul leaving your body when you looked at those photos? Because I sure did. For more of these gorgeous photos, you can follow their many fansites on Twitter, as well as their main account (BTS_TWT), where you can find many high quality selfies and other things such as music recs from everyone in the group. You can get a direct taste of their humor by watching their Bangtan Bombs and V-Lives. They love to laugh and are quite hyper 90% of the time, just about every time they get together they have loads of fun. I don\u2019t recommend watching the old Bangtan Bombs, though, because many nasty, overused jokes have spawned from them. (i.e. You got no jams) Aside from their group lives, each of the members has solo ones in which they talk to fans themselves, about music, life, and anything else, sometimes even getting visited from other members while they broadcast. For the other sides of their personality, you can watch the older and most recent episodes of Run BTS, as well as the upcoming Youtube Red series Burn The Stage. The last reason why I admire them is for the amazing things they have achieved in this past year, along with their help to spread K-pop to the U.S. Just yesterday, it was confirmed that Big Hit Entertainment is bigger than all of the top three entertainment companies in South Korea, the acclaimed SM, YG, and JYP entertainment companies. They have broken incredible sales records with their most recent album, Love Yourself: Her selling over 1.4 million copies, breaking the record of 1.2 million albums sold after h.o.t. held the record for 16 years. They have partnered with UNICEF to create a campaign titled Love Myself, whose main focus is to eradicate violence towards children and teens. They have had various TV appearances on American televison, from the Late Late Show with James Corden to Dick Clark\u2019s Rockin New Years Eve. They are truly icons in every aspect of the word, as they have done so much for the K-pop industry and for their beloved ARMY as well. They love us as much as we love them, and they constantly thank us for our support and work their hardest so that they don\u2019t make us disappointed. I made that explanation of BTS much longer than planned, lol. I\u2019m just going to do a short list for each group I mention now, because there are too many to count and do huge picture-lists for. I\u2019m going to skip over the other two boy groups I like too, because I don\u2019t know enough about them to say anything substantial. The Girl Groups I Like Are: SNSD: My queens, my leading ladies, my number 1 group. They are the group that got me into K-pop, the first group I ever stanned, the group where I found my first bias and a birthday twin, and the first group whose songs truly stuck with me throughout all these years. All of the members (including Sica), are gorgeous and extremely talented, having some of the best female vocals in K-pop along with awesome, memorable choreography. Interesting concepts are plenty with this group, as they can pull off any type of song, from cutesy and bubblegum-poppy, to classy and sexy, to heavy and dark. Their visuals are no joke, and they can melt the hearts of fans of any gender with their beauty. They are hilarious and very talented at hosting variety shows and events, and have been likened to Super Junior with their skills at MCing. However, I wasn\u2019t around for the majority of SNSD\u2019s careers, because I was a dumb child who never learned how to follow a group\u2019s activities. (Maybe I should be easier on myself about this because I was only 8\u201310 years old around those years, but I still feel like I missed everything important with them.) I was absent when Jessica made her departure, I was absent for most of their tours, I was absent for the majority of their TV appearances and comebacks (minus Mr. Mr., which I bought the day it was released.) I missed many things from pre-2013 as well, because I was a toddler/young child when they first debuted in 2007 and only started to like them in 2013. I never saw the interviews and behind-the-scenes things that I missed, or footage from the main parts of their tours. I feel incredibly guilty about this to this day. It seems like I lack so much knowledge compared to other SONEs. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn\u2019t even call myself a SONE. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be a SONE. Regardless of if I should or not, I will still continue to love and cherish SNSD until the day I die. The day they disband will be one of the darkest days of my life, and you best believe I won\u2019t be leaving my room for a few days after. I love them too much to see them break up, but I have been forcing myself to prepare for that day ever since Holiday Night came out. All we can do is wait and see, and support each other as fellow SONES when that day does come. (another long explanation whoops) Okay, they\u2019ll seriously be short now. Red Velvet- Vocals and visuals. Wendy despite being problematic sings really well, as well as Seulgi and Irene. Everyone in the group is very pretty, especially Joy to me. (Formerly Wendy was my bias, I mentioned that on another question as well as the fact that I don\u2019t have anyone else to Ult. I don\u2019t want to enable her by saying any more good things about her, because I\u2019m still angry about her most recent stunt she pulled) Twice- Lacking in vocals but are very pretty. They also get along really well and are interesting and funny to watch. Their semi-gay interactions also appeal to me, as a really lonely person, and I wish that I had someone like Sana to give me the affection I so crave. BlackPink- I love their dancing and style, even if it\u2019s only like that because YG is trying to make them into mini 2NE1. Their vocals are alright, better than Twice but worse than RV. Do like their voices though. KARA- Got into them about a month ago, can proudly say that they\u2019re the only group that I\u2019ve loved more than three B-Sides from. Almost every song on their albums is good, and to top it all off, they\u2019re gorgeous. Wish they would come back someday. After School- Same situation as KARA, got into them around two months ago. Learned to love their music, especially their Japanese stuff, and I now proudly support anyone who is in favor of burning down Pledis Entertainment to set them free. (Seriously though, screw Pledis for ditching them.) Girls Day- Not very big into them, but I love their concepts and MVs, especially Darling and Something\u2019s. Minah is an awesome vocalist as well, and her high notes always stun me. Not to mention that everyone in the group is pretty, too. Weki Meki- They may be new but they have lots of potential. IDLYG was on repeat for a week after it released, and I began to love them since. Yoojung and Doyeon are triple threats, each being very talented in rapping, singing and dancing. But what else would you expect from the former Produce 101 winners/ IOI members? I do think the other members should get more attention though. Orange Caramel- they may be a subunit of After School, but they\u2019re the whole reason I know about the group in the first place. They prove that they don\u2019t have to be sexy to a successful group, as more of their stuff leans on the cutesy side but is still extremely popular. (I.E. Catallena) I fell in love with Raina after seeing her for the first time, and Nana and Lizzy are also high on my list of hottest girl group members. I love Lizzy\u2019s sweet-sounding voice very much. This group is why I love people who are named Raina, and what I think of every time I encounter someone who is called that. AOA- Not huge on this group tbh, but I do find myself bopping along to a lot of their songs, especially Elvis and Good Luck. I always say the \u201cprince\u201d in Jimin\u2019s rap part in the song, it\u2019s become a habit. The lifeguard concept for GL was one of the best they ever had and they looked so hot in their teaser pics. I\u2019m still sad over Choa\u2019s departure, though, because she was my bias. Hopefully Yuna or Mina will pick up where she left off in their next comeback. Sistar- Another group out of the many that I got into after disbandment. Everyone in Sistar is very talented, especially Hyorin. She can, rap, dance, and sing very well, on top of looking like a supermodel. I\u2019m also extremely proud of her for creating her own agency. Can\u2019t wait till she debuts her first artist :D And so that I don\u2019t leave anyone in Sistar out, I want to tell you all that they are some of the most beautiful K-pop idols I\u2019ve ever seen, and their songs will definitely make you long for the summer. Wonder Girls- Yet another group I started to like after disbandment. I don\u2019t have a bias in the group yet, in fact I don\u2019t really even follow Sunmi anymore. But I do love their music, even the English versions of their songs, which are iconic regardless of languages. I also love the video for Like This, as it looks like it would have been really fun to be a part of it, dancing with the Wonder Girls in a giant flashmob. 2NE1- I never stanned them back in the day, and never quite found it appropriate to call myself a blackjack despite how much I listen to them. However, Come Back Home is featured heavily in my music rotations, as is Gotta Be You and Can\u2019t Nobody. They were another one of the most important girl groups in K-pop history, running the show alongside SNSD and WG for most of the early 2010s. Because of that, they have much of my respect. F(x)- I only got into them after listening to Electric Shock a few years back. I didn\u2019t follow them much or stan them hard, still don\u2019t, but as of recent I\u2019ve been listening to the Pink Tape and missing them. I finally realized how many good B-sides I missed out on, such as Pretty Girl, Step, and Kick, years after they were released. Aside from them as a group, I admire Amber very much for dressing like a tomboy in an industry full of cute/girly idols , and expressing herself the way she wants without letting haters get her down. Her solo work is also really impressive, and her most recent track with Luna was a bop. EXID- Vocal capabilities in this group are awesome. Solji, even though she\u2019s on hiatus now, sings some of the best and most memorable notes I\u2019ve ever heard in K-pop songs. Hani is another really good singer, and LE\u2019s rapping is quite good too. Hyerin is my bias because she\u2019s cute and funny+ she can sing, and Junghwa is second to her for similar reasons. G-Friend- This group is practically perfect. They have angelic voices, can dance almost flawlessly to their songs no matter the speed, and are funny on top of that. Everyone in the group is absolutely adorable, especially Umji, who shares a birthday with my mom. <3 I find it cool that she knows some English, too, and the video of her ordering McDonalds for the group baffles me every time. ( I could never remember so many orders, much less recite them as perfectly as she did) BESTie- I\u2019m still angry over Dahye and UJi\u2019s departure a few months ago, as they were my biases from the group. But that doesn\u2019t erase the fact that I listened to Excuse Me over 500 times last year, making it one of my most played songs on Spotify. I would have more to say on the group if they had stayed, because when those two left, they lost their main visual components and two of their most talented members. Hyeyeon and Haeryung are still two talented girls, but I wonder what will happen to them now that they lost half of their group. GLAM- A sad case of what happens when a group gets underpaid. I never quite liked GLAM because of the Dahee scandal, which I knew about even back in my Vocaloid phase (in case u didn\u2019t know, Dahee voiced the Korean Vocaloid SeeU prior to the scandal and her arrest, GLAM even had her on stage at some of their concerts before disbanding) and caused me to be wary of them. I changed my opinion on them after stumbling upon the video for \u201cIn Front of the Mirror\u201d while looking for empowering K-pop songs.I found that the meaning behind the song and the lyrics was something I could really relate to, and I\u2019ve liked them ever since. Their other songs showcase lots of unused potential, specifically Party XXO. Let me say now, as my final note, that Bang Shihyuk really could have made them big if Dahee hadn\u2019t screwed up. These are just a few of the GGs I like, and there are loaaaads more. (Comment if you want to know them and I\u2019ll either add them in later or tell you in a reply!) Sorry for the long answers like usual, but I need to get my thoughts out in the way I see fit, which is writing a lot. Nonetheless, I hope you guys enjoy his list and that maybe some of you become a new fan of these groups. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to do a male/female combined stan list (and why I adore them). ATEEZ: I don\u2019t really know the idols themselves but god, do I love their discography. It\u2019s such a different taste to me but I LOVE it. Probably my favourite all rounded kpop discography, so these buys have the capacity to shoot up to number one. No bias\u2019s yet but these boys are really shining.  IZ*ONE: These girls honestly are so sweet and I got so attached to all of them during Produce 48. I was near distraight hearing they mightn\u2019t promote because of the Mnet rigging saga. I love their concepts and I just melt when they perform. I\u2019ve loved the more badass covers and honestly I just milk up every bit of content they put out. I always get way too attached to temporary groups and I\u2019ll be so sad when they disband, but honestly the stuff they\u2019ve released makes up for it. The teasers for BLOOM*IZ look so good and I\u2019m super excited for the release.  My bias in IZ*ONE is the one and only Miyawaki Sakura. God when I first saw her, her visuals hit me like a truck and as a straight female, I\u2019m proud to say it. She is genuinely kind, polite and sweet. She\u2019s up front and voices her insecurites. She puts everything into improving herself and I admire her so much. I\u2019m not going to be that person that says she would be a better center then Wonyoung (who\u2019s also a queen) - (but she sort of would have been).  EXO: One of my groups whose music I adore, but I haven\u2019t fully gotten into the idols themselves. Honestly their vocal line hurts me when they sing they\u2019re so good, but the acapella in Tempo literally hit me in 400 different places at the same time. I have so much respect for the group and what they\u2019ve been through and the place in the industry.  My Bias(s): Chen and Xiumin. I maintain that Chen is one of the hottest idols in the industry in that simple, smooth way. His voice is my dream and everything I aspire to be. His fiancee jackpotted there, and I\u2019m sure he did as well. I wish him good health for his family. I hope he takes a break when the child is born to care for them and get to know them. Xiumin had my heart from KoKoBop. I don\u2019t know why but he just stuck out to me as hilarious, very polite and gentlemanly and very in touch with his masculine side (wow I sound like a creep lol). Love him, all the best for his military duties.   Everglow: Honestly these girls have such sweet personalities I adore all of them. There music was fantastic from the get go and I can't wait to hear more from them. There\u2019s not much content out yet but they have the capacity to be one of the biggest girl groups - I hope they get the right promotions and directing.  Bias: Yiren. Don\u2019t know why but I\u2019m very drawn to her personality and I relate to her a lot. She has a really unique visual and I don\u2019t know she\u2019s really talented and I just love her.  Blackpink: Well I swear I\u2019ve biased every one of these girls at one point and I\u2019ve just accepted that I\u2019m an OT4 stan, I love them all. I really like their music to listen to casually and there title tracks are such power anthems. At this point it\u2019s ridiculous with there comeback all we\u2019ve gotten is Awesome Screen, Awesome Camera, Long Lasting Battery Life. And I doubt we\u2019ll get much more for a far amount of time. The girls are clearly not enjoying themselves so I\u2019m glad they have such a tight bond.  TWICE (ULT GG): I could write an essay on each member alone but these girls\u2026 Every single one of them has a special place in my heart. They\u2019ve been through so much together and they\u2019re still so loyal to each other and show so much love towards us Once\u2019s. They aren;t the most talented but together they have worked so much to improve there skills and they have one of the best dance all rounders, visuals in every member, absolutely gorgeous voices and some very talented rappers. I hope they keep producing music they enjoy and are comfortable with. The girls never fail to put a smile on my face. I\u2019ll support them no matter what, they\u2019re entitled to love, health and happiness just as much as anyone else.  Bias(s): Jihyo (ULT), Tzuyu, Mina and Sana. Jihyo is perfect to me, I respect her, her attitude and commitment so much and she\u2019s my biggest role model.  Tzuyu\u2019s personality I relate to on a cosmic level, reserved but hilarious (I like to think I\u2019m funny but my friends would disagree lol) and her visuals are god tier. She\u2019s improved so much since debut and really showed the general public her talent and her drive to succeed and accomplish her dreams.  Mina has just struck me as someone who I wish I could be, so likeable and friendly but also quiet and humble. She is the epitome of elegant and I relay hope she\u2019s feeling better and is taking as much time as she needs to recover.  Sana is rising higher and higher every moment and she\u2019s bias wrecking me as a bias. She\u2019s seems so genuine and friendly. No Sana No life tbh.  BTS (ULTs): I swear these boys just hit different for me. They\u2019re more then just kpop idols. Without them and their music, personalities and Love Yourself campaign, I\u2019d still be in a very bad place. I honestly think these boys were fated to meet. They have the strongest bond with each other and the personalities contrast so well to create the perfect group. They are managed really well and they are so honest and sincere towards their fans and most importantly, themselves. Like Twice, I could right essays on each of them and honestly I\u2019m such an OT7.  Bias (ULT): V. I\u2019ve said it before but I\u2019ll say it again. My ideal type. At the risk of sounding like a creep for the 10th time, I\u2019m very attracted to his personality and his attitude. Very free spirited and sweet but not afraid to show his emotions as anyone should be. I\u2019ll save you the time of having to read it but he\u2019ll always have my heart.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far :) ",

            "answer_text": "I stan quite a few. Around like 8 I think. I\u2019ll name them off and give two reasons! Twice- These girls are rays of sunshine seriously. Their music isn\u2019t girl crushy which I find cool because it\u2019s such a big genre now, but it\u2019s more bubblegum poppy (?). All of the girls are so caring and talented and that really shows through their hard work.  Blackpink- I know, controversial. Yes I stan all of the big three and have no issues. All four of the girls in Blackpink have such bright and amazing personalities. I have never ONCE seen any of them be rude. I know they love music, but unfortunately their company is holding them back because they could do sooooo well internationally.  Red Velvet- I mean what\u2019s seriously not to love about these girls. They all work so well together and I\u2019m always so attracted to their interviews because they just make me laugh. While I\u2019ve heard their rap line is weak, I personally think Irene and Yeri are good rappers and they\u2019re all good vocalist.  Mamamoo- seriously once you watch one mamamoo thing, you fall into a hole. I could go on and on about these girls. First off, they break most forms of standards in Korea. From Hwasa not changing her body, to Solar ripping off her shirt, to Moonbyul advocating for LGBTQ+ and Wheein not changing her ideas, they\u2019re amazing. Also their vocals and rap are seriously no joke.  Iz*one- I would say that they\u2019re underrated, but I also don\u2019t know where they stand in popularity. They\u2019ve had two comebacks since debut and honestly, I\u2019ve loved and spent hours gushing over them. All their songs are just so good. They have a lot of cute songs and a lot of badass songs. With there being 12 members, it allows for so much talent in dancing, singing and rapping. Oh and VISUALS.  Itzy- They won rookie of the year for a reason. These girls are so new to the industry yet they\u2019re taking it by storm. They aren\u2019t afraid to show their true passion and even though they\u2019re a bit hesitant because they\u2019re still building a reputation, I can\u2019t help but fall in love with them. I really admire them for having songs that don\u2019t really fit in a category (it must be a JYP thing). They are also AMAZING dancers. Stan the Chae sisters.  BTS- okay so I knew they were huge and I didn\u2019t really stan them until I had stanned all the groups listed before this. The versatility in the group is what makes them so entertaining and talented. I mean they are so advanced in all forms of music. On top of that, they have such a good bond that they don\u2019t need to be fake even when they were taking America by storm. I really truly love their personalities.  Stray kids- People who are into BTS I feel would really like stray kids. They give me a similar vibe to BTS even though they\u2019re completely different. I was originally attracted to their dance but ended up falling in love with their personality. They are all so hilarious and just work well together. Also their vocals, rap, and definitely dance are so good. I would put them up there in talent along side BTS for boy groups.  Solo- I stan a few solo artists too that I thought I would mention quickly. I stan Chunga, Somi, AleXa, Taeyeon and Jessica (SNSD), Sunmi and Hyuna. Obviously I\u2019m more of a girl group kind of girl. To anyone new to kpop I would recommend all of these groups. I personally ignore the controversy surrounding stanning multiple groups and just follow what I love. Yes it is possible to stan Blackpink, Twice and Red Velvet all at the same time. I\u2019m just happy with the 8 groups and have been getting into Loona, Everglow, and Got7 lately. ",

Each member can stand on his own. Their solo work proves it. ONEW  Go listen to his version of Rainy Blue. I never get over how beautifully he sings that song. JONGHYUN  His solo work speaks for itself: albums, Radio show, SNL\u2026 Two of my favorite songs of his are: SKELETON FLOWER and WARM WINTER. May he Rest In Peace. He is gone but never forgotten. 5HINee, always five members. KEY  Savage. That\u2019s all I am going to say. \u201cWatch out, babe\u201d. MINHO  I just love the way he raps. It\u2019s so cute and always so smooth. I am not saying he is the best rapper. I am just saying that I love the way he does it. And I love his acting. When he is done being an idol, he has something else to fall back on. TAEMIN  Need I say more? The boy is KPOP. There is no KPOP without TAEMIN. PeriodT. His skills are unmatched. Just look at him. Aren\u2019t you entranced? He is 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation of KPOP. The boy got it. MY FAVORITE KPOP BAND! They don\u2019t have a concept. They are the WHOLE CONCEPT. Their music is always bright and preppy and it makes me happy. Whenever I need a pick me up, I listen to them. That\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t like them but don\u2019t say anything disrespectful under my answer. Go write your own about your favorite KPOP band. ",

In terms of girl groups, I adore Red Velvet. Red Velvet is the type of group where you\u2019re never bored with their songs because of the sheer versatility. For me, the songs that I like of a group are just as important as the group chemistry and the connection I have with them (I\u2019ll be getting into this more later). Red Velvet has almost anything you can name of any concept - the differences in theme with their songs Ice Cream Cake, Rookie, Bad Boy, Butterflies, One of These Nights, and Peek-A-Boo are all so different and they have an incredible creative streak with their music videos, which have storylines and plots that you don\u2019t see in any other mainstream group. The members themselves are all very well-rounded and talented, and they\u2019re all sweethearts. I don\u2019t consider myself a Reveluv because I\u2019m not as interested in them as I think I should be for it to be fair to say that I\u2019m a fan, but I definitely support them and I love all their songs.  Seulgi is my bias, who\u2019s yours?  This isn\u2019t really a girl or a boy group, but it\u2019s a sibling duet! Akdong Musician is such a well-loved group within South Korea but they don\u2019t have much of an international following and I wish more people could find their lyrics. They\u2019re all written and composed solely by Lee Chan-Hyuk (the older brother), and Suhyun (the younger sister) has one of the most beautiful voices in the industry. These two are just so talented and lovely and they have such good songs, a few being Dinosaur, Melted (I truly recommend this, it has incredible meaning and lyrics and the song itself is just breathtaking), and Re-Bye.   Now boy groups. There are two that pop out to me. BTS. People reading this may actually be surprised if they\u2019ve seen me on Quora before, but BTS was the first group that got me into K-Pop and will always remain a special group in my heart. They brought me into this world of creativity and talent beyond what I\u2019d imagined of my own country. They were the inspirations behind my life for months. I still adore the members and respect all of them so much for everything they\u2019ve ever been through and I wish them the best in all their endeavors. BTS is well known for their underdog story and the message behind their songs in their earlier years in songs such as Not Today, N.O., and Save Me, but what I actually like the most about them is their resilience and their good natures. With an industry as brutal as the one they\u2019ve risen in, it would have been easy to rely solely on common mainstream ideas to gain popularity, but they didn\u2019t do that. They stuck with their ideas, their lyrics, and their emotions throughout their entire careers (save a few songs) and I love that about them so much. Taehyung, who was my first bias in BTS, is such a sweet, bubbly person. Jimin and Hoseok are amazing dancers that inspire me to work harder, dance harder, dream bigger. I love Jin to death and I wish people could see his talent more. His vocal teacher adores him because according to him, Jin improves with every single lesson. Namjoon will forever be the suffering father and leader of the group, but I adore his efforts for BTS and the other members. Yoongi has touched me so deeply with a lot of what he has written and never fails to surprise me with what he does. And Jungkook is the golden maknae who can truly do anything he sets his mind to. Anyone that\u2019s read all this may wonder why I\u2019ve left the fandom, but it\u2019s simply because I lost interest in their music. It isn\u2019t because of their Love Yourself series, which, unlike what a lot of other people seemed to think, did actually have a rather deep message and was as emotionally charged as their other albums. It was more just the songs themselves. I need a good melody to keep interest in a song. It\u2019s why I especially prefer songs that have a great vocal climax - because I keep coming back to it and I never get bored. My musical tastes have also changed over the years, and that\u2019s something that I can\u2019t control, no matter how much I love these boys. I wish them the best in all they do, and I\u2019ll continue to watch them from the sidelines with a proud smile on my face. Hoseok is my baby, feel free to comment your own bias or scream about him with me :)   EXO. My ultimate group until, hopefully - my last breath. I just. I love them to death. I found out about them, ironically, from a bunch of ARMYs and EXO-Ls that were fighting in the comments section in another video. I didn\u2019t pay mind to it in the beginning, but then I saw Chen singing Tears by So Chan-Whee in its original female key (which is already really hard itself) and I was awestruck. His vocals were a gift from the gods and I would like to fight anyone that disagrees. After I found out about Jongdae, I started looking for other members. Baekhyun, I would like to add, also has one of the best voices I\u2019ve heard as a K-Pop fan so far and every note he sang seemed to fall from an angel\u2019s lips. Kyungsoo, too. Jongin is voted year after year by other idols to be the best active dancer in the industry and it\u2019s quite easy to see why. Yixing composes, writes, translates, and produces all his solos and he\u2019s such a powerful dancer. Chanyeol, as a main rapper, composes, writes, sings, and plays at least three different instruments. This group was just so talented and I couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t fallen for them before. And then I learned about them, as a group. As idols. As brothers. So many people say that EXO has a superficial relationship, that they\u2019re not as close as other groups tend to act on camera. However, the lack of fake skinship doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t close. Chanyeol drove Baekhyun on a trip that lasted hours to his concert on his free day on his own time. Jongdae and Minseok are so close because they were the only two Korean members in China. Kyungsoo cooks for Sehun often because Sehun has particular tastes. Chanyeol buys a lot of things for all the members. Yixing always promotes them in other countries when he can\u2019t perform with them. They\u2019ve been through so much. They were called SM\u2019s worst mistakes for a whole year after they debuted. The entire industry seemed to be out for them. Even after the hate died down, they were accused of being carbon copies of Super Junior and nothing they did appeased the Korean public. Three of their members left early, leaving some members without their best friends and confidantes, Baekhyun and Taeyeon were torn by the media and supposed fans for a scandal that wasn\u2019t even a scandal, really - and they suffered through so much shit over their idol lives that I just want to wrap them up in blankets and see them happy. EXO\u2019s songs are also just a treat in general. They\u2019ve done ballads like Lights Out and Universe, to electric beats like KoKoBop, hard rock with Drop That (and Chen\u2019s incredible high note), as well as the pure and happy song that was Power, and then songs like Tempo that had a freaking acapella bridge in the middle of it? And then they released Promise, which was written entirely by Chen and Chanyeol, co-composed by Lay. It holds so much emotion and it has such a powerful message within the lyrics. Their songs never bore me and I always end up crawling back to them. They have every type of song to fit my every single mood and I just love that about them. Their versatility knows no bounds. I love them for all they\u2019ve done, all they\u2019ve been through, and all they will continue to do. I love all the members (I have no bias, really), and my short term goal in life is to see them live, because I really just want to hear their god-like voices through something more than a computer screen.   A special mention that I just couldn\u2019t leave out: TVXQ and Super Junior. These groups are both so talented with all their members, and they\u2019ve also been through so much within their times as idols, but they\u2019ve thrived and they are now both known as legends in the industry. My TVXQ bias is Changmin, my Super Junior bias goes between Leeteuk and Eunhyuk. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t write more about them but I\u2019m just so tired.  (Super Junior above, TVXQ below)  Thank you for reading! ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not that much of a multi-stan but I'm making a list mostly based on my music preferences and looks(not visuals but the kind of vibe they give off) 10. Red Velvet:When I first saw red velvet they gave off this dark mysterious vibe which attracted me b/c most of gg have that cute sweet image, I'm not saying there's something wrong with it but it's just not my style. I liked them after listening to their peekaboo. In my opinion RV are really underrated.  Also give Monster (Irene and suelgi's) a listen. 9. Sf9:I first fell in love with them after listening to' O sole mio'\u2026.that song of theirs is just *chef's kiss*. Their rappers are really great but the fact that they are 9 kind of kept me from getting interested in knowing them besides their music. For me 7+ member in a group is just too many.  8. Blackpink:Queens of gg's, but their recent comeback just wasn't my taste at all. But visually and vocally they are good and I really like the music they make, I love when they do that bad bitch style like they did in 'kill this love'. They rock every concept they do. My favourite member is Ros\u00e9.  7. Stray kids:A fun fact: I followed them on Instagram without knowing what/who they were. I just followed because I liked the name, I thought it was unique and cool. So when I listened to hellavator for the first time I was like wait these guys look familiar XD.  Yes after that I started listening to their music and fell in love with some of their songs, side effects, my pace being ones on the list. 6. Mamamoo:Like their vocals so much. My favourite songs of theirs are, starry night, Hwasa's Maria, gogobebe and a few more.  5. Monsta x:F***ing love their voices and like all of their songs that I listened to up until now. Favourites are play it cool, follow, and literally the whole album that was in English (sorry can't remember the name). Although I am not into them besides music but I was genuinely sad when Wonho left.  4. Day6:Day6 have the music style that you want at the end of a hard day. Their music just relaxes you, and right up my alley. Also they are super talented and underrated.  3. JJP:Yes, this needs a separate mention. JJP also known as JJ project is a subunit of two of got7's members, but since they existed way before got7 I think they have their own identity. Their album Verse2 is a blessing to the world which most haven't even discovered yet. All of their songs are so serene and beautiful, written, composed and sung with so much love. All of the songs have their own vibe to it. My favourite song from that album is 'Coming home'. I still remember myself gasping while listening to the chorus of that song for the first time. I just hope they comeback soon.  Did I mention that the aesthetics of the album are on another level!? 2. Jus2:Just2 also a subunit of got7 but have a completely separate identity. Jus2 is comparitively new(debuted in 2019). Their first (and only album up until now) Focus is literally so underrated in my opinion because this album is THAT bitch that makes you want to dress up sexily and dance on your own at two in the morning.  Go watch& listen to \u2018focus on me' and you'll thank me for telling you. 1. Got7:  you've probably got the idea by now that I'm an ahgase. This is the band that I really care about, got7 feels like home, they really feel so close like they're your friends b/c they're so open, genuine and honest that you feel like you know them like your friends. Even though I'm new to the rest of kpop, I've been an ahgase for a number of years now. Their music(especially the one they compose themselves) is just so beautiful. I have a habit of imagining songs as matters or abstract things(e.g: this song is ocean, this one is glitter falling from dusky sky). And listening to got7 makes me imagine alot of beautiful things. Also stanning them includes free therapy, anti-depressants, mood-lifters, you name it! In genuine words they feel more real and human-like. They're so underrated for their potential b/c they have got the worst promotion any one can ever get. And ut really sucks when you're an ahgase for so long. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. Have a great day and be kind and understanding to people. Bless you, bye. ",

            "answer_text": "My reasons aren\u2019t all that unique lolololol Okay, let\u2019s see. EXO\u2014 they were the group I first fell in love with and that drew me into the black hole that is K-pop. I loved their music (\u201cHistory\u201d was my first favorite), and as I got to know them more through interviews and such, I really fell in love with their personalities. Not to mention they all look like gods. BTS\u2014 gosh, this group is just the worst. I hate them (not really). I\u2019ve been into EXO for about two years but I\u2019ve only known BTS since March 2016 and they\u2019re already competing with EXO to be my bias group. But anyway, I love BTS because first off, most of their songs are just so catchy! A lot of groups (in my opinion, don\u2019t be offended) start of pretty great, then along the way, their music starts appealing to me less and less. But with BTS, I don\u2019t know. Almost every single song of theirs is amazing! Then you have their god-like looks. And finally, they\u2019re all such stupid idiots. I often wonder why I stan them. They\u2019re so stupid. Even Namjoon with his IQ of 148. VIXX\u2014 for VIXX, I\u2019m more there for the music than the people. Still, I really do love the members, again, they\u2019re very lovable and N\u2019s stank-face is one of the best things I\u2019ve ever seen. (I co-bias him and Ravi) SEVENTEEN\u2014 god help me with these lovable beagles. They\u2019re still so young, yet they\u2019re so independent and talented. They make me feel like kowtow-ing before them and shining their shoes and whatnot, they make me feel like scum XD. They make their own music and choreograph it themselves! Dude! That\u2019s! So! Admirable! I really admire them so much, and their music is really really really good too! And of course, their looks. And that\u2019s that. Hope that was helpful! Update 04/26/17 I fell into the Monsta X fandom. Now I feel like dying. Monsta X\u2014 Beagles. What the hell even are they. They\u2019re godforsaken aliens I swear to god, they\u2019re so dumb and lovable at the same time. Why does Kihyun look so great with pink hair. Why does Minhyuk look so great with glasses. Why do they all look so great. Please kill me. Vocals are on point. I wanna die. Dancing is just absolutely wonderful. Goodbye now I need to go scream into my pillow some more. Update 08/20/17 I managed to get myself into NCT over summer and I\u2019m paying the price\u2014 NCT\u2014 What the fuck. They\u2019re all so talented. I can\u2019t believe NCT Dream is debuted I actually can\u2019t believe NCT Dream is a thing. Why are they so talented. They make me feel like shit because what am I doing with my life?? Kill me??? They\u2019re all so handsome?? There\u2019re so many triple threats?? And dude what the fuck is Ten\u2019s dancing I\u2019m screaming??? And Taeyong looks like an actual fairy??? I\u2019m dead\u2014 ",

            "answer_text": "My ultimate fave group is SHINee. They might not be as popular and trending as other groups but their talent is amazing. I\u2019ve been a fan since their debut 2008 and I grew up with them since we are on the same age bracket. Listening to their songs is my therapy! Their vocals are very extra. Onew\u2019s sweet voice Jonghyun\u2019s powerful vocals KEY\u2019s unique and nasal voice Minho\u2019s deep sound Taemin\u2019s airy vocals all of them dances so well that they are known for being the best when it comes to live performaces \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f All members as well is like a family and knew each others weaknesses and strengths! I cannot even pick my fave song from all their albums because I love them a lot. I also love how they support each other\u2019s individual careers. They always make sure to find time to be personally present  Shawols as a fandom is my fave as well because pur community is very peaceful and humble. We do not start any fight and we only focus on supporting the members  SHINee forever \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f Next group that is growing in mu heart for the past 4 years is EXO. They may have a lot of haters but Eris loves them all, I also love them \u2764\ufe0f Their talent is undeniably great. EXO always standout with everything they do and release. They are not trying to prove themeselves to everyone, they are just doing their best everytime which resulted them being on top! EXO might not win a lot of awards since 2018 but it does not define them as less. Their comeback this 2018 is out of this world  Their closeness is not uust a simple friendship but a brotherhood. Others may question that but for us EXO-L\u2019s we witnessed how they love and care for each other. I\u2019ll be supporting them until their old ",

            "answer_text": "Check out : EXO. EXO is my favourite group because I really like their music a lot. Most of their songs are bops and I like how with each and every comeback they get better and better with their music. I would suggest you to watch their debut year music video first like MAMA. It'll help you out to get to know them better. Then, you should watch their popular music videos like Growl, Monster, Call Me Baby and Tempo.Red Velvet. Red Velvet is like the female version of EXO. I like them because of their music. I tend to listen to their discography most of the time because they're just so good. All of their albums are bops. On top of that, they have two concepts which you can choose from so you won't stand a chance not to look up to them. The Red concept is mostly bubbly, cheerful and cute kind of vibes so it's mostly preferred by the Asian fans especially the Korean fans. The Velvet concept is mainly soft, balad and R&B kind of vibes so most Western fans actually prefer this concept better. I would suggest you to watch their Dumb Dumb, Bad Boy, Red Flavor and Peek-a-Boo music video on YouTube.NCT is also one of my favourite groups because they are all very talented and amazing. They need more love tbh. They are known to have a very interesting concept with their group consisting unlimited amount of members. However, don't worry because they are splited into sub-units like NCT U, NCT 127, NCT DREAM and the latest one, WayV which is currently debuting in China. Right now, their group consists of 21 members in total (and still counting). NCT is also a group which is mesnt to be very diverse and for that, they've released their own songs in different languages including Korean, Chinese, English and Japanese. My favourite songs from them are NCT U's The 7th Sense, NCT 127\u2019s Simon Says, NCT U's Boss, NCR DREAM\u2019s We Go Up and NCT 127\u2019s Cherry Bomb.EVERGLOW. I have to mention this group although they're just a rookie. I've never heard a debut song like theirs in the Kpop industry ever. It's very unusual for a Kpop group to debut with that kinf of song so you should definitely check them out. Search for Everglow's Bon Bon Chocolat on YouTube.TWICE. Since Twice is one of the most popular Kpop groups out there (with so many achievements), you should also check them out. My suggestion would be Like Ooh Ah, Cheer Up and TT.If you want to know more about these groups I would definitely help you out by suggesting more songs especially their b-side tracks for you so feel free to explore more Kpop groups.

Stray Kids  This is a newer group, only debuting in 2017, but I absolutely love them. Not only because of their cute, adorable faces- I mean, look at that little squirrel in the bottom left(Jisung) or the adorable face in the top right(Seungmin)- their music is fantastic. They have a variety of pieces from powerful ones, like \u201cDistrict 9\u201d and \u201cMy Pace\u201d, to more cheerful ones, like \u201cGet Cool\u201d and \u201cAwkward Silence\u201d. They\u2019re also very real with how they act on their reality show \u201cThe 9th\u201d and are so loveable with each other and their fans. They are still pretty young, the oldest being born in \u201997 and the youngest in \u201801, but would you expect from people that just debuted and are rapidly rising in the charts. Bias: Jisung (My little squirrel in the bottom left) Favorite Song(s): Voices + Insomnia 2.) Got7  Now this group has been getting a lot more recognition in the U.S., like BTS, the last few years. Being from the same Entertainment company as Stray Kids- JYP Entertainment if you didn\u2019t know- they are all completely INSANE, but that\u2019s why I love them. They are all childish- even though the youngest was born in \u201997 and the oldest in \u201893- but can still be serious when needed. They are very hard working and have calmer songs thanks to the amazing leader they have (JB, the black haired one in the back row) Bias: Youngjae (The black haired one in the middle row) Favorite Song(s): You Are + Moon U 3.) BTS  Okay, before anyone jumps down my throat saying \u201cOh my Goodness, they\u2019re so overrated\u201d, \u201cHow do you like them, you can\u2019t even understand what they\u2019re saying\u201d (which to this comment, I would like to rely it to every single person that either has, or still does, like(d) the song \u201cDespacito\u201d and can\u2019t speak enough Spanish to understand it. I\u2019ll be waiting for why this is so terrible and that isn\u2019t). This group is the calmest out of the three. They are so hard working, putting out so many songs for us in only six years. They were also just at the 2019 Grammy\u2019s where, though they didn\u2019t win the Grammy they were nominated for (next year though), they were able to present one. I\u2019m so proud of them and can\u2019t wait for the new songs that will be \u201ccoming out sooner than later\u201d. Bias: Jungkook (The black haired one kneeling in front of the other five- Jimin\u2019s next to him) Favorite Song(s): Spring Day + Airplane pt. 2 Honorable mentions that I like the few of the songs I\u2019ve heard and/or seen live shots of them in reality type shows(again, not in any specific order): ExoAstroBlackPinkSeventeenKNK",

            "answer_text": "GOT7 they are amazing to me! They really got me into KPop. I had heard other groups but no one caught my heart like they did. The way they are together, they make me laugh. Like I want to have them all over for dinner and we laugh and play like family friends. As individuals they inspire me to be the best version of me. To be completely satisfied with being me, the me I truly am. Not the one the camera or society wants to see. I love how honest their lyrics are. They have all written songs that have touched my heart deeply. There songs seem very open and seem to say, \u201chere I am on paper, I hope you like it, if not, oh well I love you anyway.\u201d They inspire me to wait on true love. JB is a kind, firm leader; as the eldest of four it surprised me seeing how kind and caring he is as an only child. JB, fearless leader, is such a corky guy. It\u2019s adorable! Mark, oh handsome Mark! He is the oldest and to me it appears he is most humble. I am not sure why Mark is not extra cocky, but I really admire that about him. He seems to mentor the guys with lessons with how he lives his life as opposed to preaching at them, I like that about him. Jackson does not know who he is or how wonderful he is, it is sad but brings me joy to watch him grow and I have hope that Jackson, and all the guys will know they are worthy of love and worth dying for. Jesus paid the same price for every human being, we all have the same price tag. And we are all SO VALUABLE just because we are, not earning it or deserving, just wake up and breathe. You are more valuable than everything in the universe except the person/people in front of you, cause we were all bought at the same price. Park Jinyoung is such a wonderful mystery to me. I think he is a talented lyricist, actor, singer and dancer. He could model whatever he desired. He says he will be a god father and I believe he will be an even better husband. He is kind and so mean to Yugyeom. He reminds me of my baby sister the way he picks with him. Youngjae (Sunshine is usually what I call him) is so sweet, funny and kind to me. He makes me laugh and Got7 would never be the same without him. BamBam aka Double B!!! He is so funny! I want to cook for him! I like his accent when he speaks Korean and English, he really makes everyone laugh. He seems to be the mutual one amongst the members but he will speak what he believes in. Yugyeom! The maknae or youngest brother! He is so kind and sweet! I am so excited to see him become his own man! He loves his brothers and he has blossomed so much. You can hear all of their progress and development on their most recent album and individual/duo projects. I really appreciate the way they love us Ahgases, even when Jinyoung slashes our hearts and smacks down the kisses. I will give them my support until I can no longer.BTS THESE GUYS ARE HILARIOUS! I would enjoy cooking for them! JHope and Suga make me cry all the time! RM is such a good leader, Jin is an amazing big brother. BTS as a whole is a group of some amazing guys that are blessed to be together and has blessed the world with their friendship and hearts of love. I love how smart V is and how Jungkook puts everything on the line for his brothers and their ARMY. Jimin need never feel down about himself. I hate when they are down about themselves. They love each other so deeply and truly. They really give themselves to their fans, I appreciate how far they have come and where they are going.Winner I have not spent as much time studying or listening to other people the way I have with GOT7 and BTS because once I like something, I like it and I ignore everything else. But my best friend that introduced me to KPop kept pushing other artists on me so\u2026.I like Winner!! Mino is adorable! Yoon has a voice that would make a dove cry (not exactly sure what that means, but it sounded legit ;) ) I like every member for what they do, like I said, what I know about everyone else is hear say and a few songs I have heard because of my best friend. I like what I have heard from them, I have not watched any videos of them playing around, hanging out, pulling pranks or doing aegyo like I have with GOT7 and BTS, but they seem cool.   #4. NCT, all of NCT lol NCT U, NCT 127, NCT Dream\u2026I like them all! I like the songs I have heard and they guys are funny, (I saw a Buzzfeed video of NCT 127 and I thought they were adorable together. #5I would say this spot has a tie between Stray Kids and BlackPink\u2026.they each have two songs I like: \u201cMy pace\u201d and \u201cI am you\u201d by Stray Kids and \u201cDdu du ddu du\u201d and \u201cWhistle\u201d by BlackPink. The message in my pace made me cry the first time I heard it/read it. It is about loving yourself and not comparing yourself to others and being the best you at your own pace every day. I like love songs which is why I like I am you. The songs by BlackPink are cute to me and have a beat I like dancing to.  ",

            "answer_text": "I listen to A LOT of Kpop groups. I\u2019ve slipped in and out of Kpop for almost 10 years until more recently a few years ago, I really fell in deep. So over the years I\u2019ve followed various groups with various concepts and styles of music and can recongnize a lot from songs from 2nd generations till now. There are time throughout the year when there\u2019d be a 2 week time pocket where so many groups are announcing comebacks, I can\u2019t even keep up! Ok sorry if I sound like I\u2019m bragging, I\u2019m not I swear! Basically what I\u2019m getting at is, I follow and listen to a lot of Kpop groups. There are groups where I\u2019d watch their MVs as soon as it drops, listen to every song on the album, buy the album, watch all their variety show appearances and know every member and their stats (age, birthdays, various trivia) and then there are groups where I\u2019d follow a bit more casually, watch their MVs, Some variety shows, know some members, and maybe have a few of their B-sides on my playlist. At the moment, my top groups who I follow the most on are: Seventeen, Nu\u2019est, Gfriend, DreamCatcher, NCT, Mamamoo, and Monsta X But again, I \u201clike\u201d so many more groups than that. Some other groups I follow but maybe not as religiously as those are: Astro, Lovelyz, AOA, WJSN, Oh My Girl, A.C.E, SF9, EXID, Infinite, Twice and a few more that I can\u2019t think of. But then there are groups I\u2019d listen to more casually like BTS, Kard, WekiMeki, ONF, Got7, BlackPink, Super Junior, EXO and basically every other group on my massive Kpop playlist. Honestly I\u2019m not picky when it comes to Kpop. I don\u2019t think you need to buy all versions of a groups album, watch every MV they drop, stream it 24/7, like every song they come out with to justify yourself as a fan. You can be a fan of a group just by simply enjoying the content they put out. And also, there\u2019s nothing wrong with not liking one of your favorites group\u2019s song. Everyone has different taste and preferences. Not everyone is going to like you\u2019re favorite groups and your not going to like everyone else\u2019s. That\u2019s why so many groups with so many styles exist, there\u2019s something for everyone! In my personal opinion don\u2019t think you can call yourself \u201cKpop fan\u201d if you only listen to one group. Your just a fan of that group. Anyways, that\u2019s my two cents. Yes I like other Kpop groups. A lot of them actually. ",

            "answer_text": "ok, so I\u2019m gonna do my top 10 groups. No. 1 BTS are and have always been my ults. I found out about them during DNA era, but only got to stanning them in Idol era, which is a really big regret of mine. My bias is Jimin, I love his voice and his dancing a lot. Also, he\u2019s really cute- No. 2 Stray Kids come in second place - they\u2019re so precious. I found out about them during My Pace era, but only got into them a little while after MIROH era. My bias is Hyunjin, and I really love his rapping, he has his own unique flow. Also goddamn his dancing is literally so amazing. No. 3 ATEEZ comes third. I discovered ATEEZ a little after Say My Name was released, and began stanning them a little while before Wave and Illusion. My bias is Seonghwa. His vocals are absolutely amazing, and I can\u2019t believe that he can rap amazingly too. I love it when he\u2019s performing HALA HALA he always looks possessed with San. No. 4 EXO takes the fourth. EXO was actually the second group I\u2019ve heard of, I think I found out about them maybe when Universe came out, but only got to stan them during Tempo. My bias is Sehun, mainly because I love his rap, but he\u2019s such a meme. No. 5 I\u2019m actually pretty new to NCT, but NCT is my fifth. I found out about NCT after Simon Says was released, but only began stanning them a month after BOOM was released. My biases are Taeyong and Xiaojun because I can\u2019t chose only one. They\u2019re both so talented, and I love them so much. No. 6 My 6th group is GOT7. I found out about GOT7 maybe 3 months after Lullaby was released, but only got to stanning them 2 weeks before Eclipse was released. My bias is Jackson, because I\u2019m Chinese and he\u2019s Chinese lol. Also, I love his raspy voice. No. 7 Ok, believe me, this was a hard decision. But number 7 is probably DAY6. I don\u2019t remember exactly when I got into them, but I do know I became a massive fan after Sweet Chaos, which I\u2019m aware, was a really short time ago. My bias is Wonpil. It used to be YoungK, but Wonpil really proved his talents to me. No. 8 This was a really tough decision, but number 8 for me is A.C.E. I\u2019m still a bit new to them, but it took me a really short time to immediately stan them. I love their songs, and they\u2019re all so talented - singing, rapping, everything. My bias is either Chan or Jun. I love Chan because of his amazing vocal range (as proved in their cover of Youngblood), and I love Jun\u2019s voice in Undercover and it really does some things to me. No. 9 I think personally number 9 for me would have to be Red Velvet. Red Velvet, along with TWICE, ITZY, and Everglow, are one of the only few girl groups I stan. I really loved Red Velvet\u2019s Peek-a-boo, and that was a major yes for me. Umpah Umpah was not good in my opinion, and that\u2019s what stopped me from going further as a Reveluv. But after Psycho released, I jffajdfljjaoigjag My bias? I literally can\u2019t choose. I love Irene so much and her rapping is amazing. I love Joy\u2019s smile so much, and she\u2019s beyond talent. And Wendy\u2019s vocals in Psycho really gets to me. Yeri is so pretty and cute oml. And Seulgi is such a dance queen and has amazing vocals. No. 10 Welp, TXT takes 10th. I got into TXT before they even debuted, and was probably waiting for their debut when BigHit first announced the debut date. I stanned TXT lot during Crown, and TXT was number 7 on my list. But I kinda got out of the fandom, but only after Run Away released did I join again. My bias is Soobin. Although my first bias was Yeonjun, I love Soobin\u2019s rapping a lot, and I know that he\u2019ll be a great leader. ",

            "answer_text": "Right now I can confidently say it\u2019s Akdong Musician but I call them AKMU, consisting of brother-sister duo Lee Chanhyuk and Lee Suhyun.  They debuted 7 April 2014 with the song 200% (which is still my least favourite AKMU song, forgive me) after emerging the winners of Kpop Star. I have never watched it, but what I constantly hear is that they were excellent performers, so I might watch it out of curiosity. Over the years, they have never failed to improve more and more, and their sound always impresses me. Reasons why I love them: Their music doesn\u2019t fit the typical standard in K-Pop, they rarely have any tropical house or hip-hop. There\u2019s something about their sound that\u2019s so organic and refreshing. We have Chanhyuk to thank largely, resident songwriter and composer for AKMU\u2019s songs. The lyrics alternate between deep and thought-provoking to fun and light-hearted. And Suhyun\u2019s vocals are above average, she has a pretty powerful voice.They may not have the ideal appearance for K-Pop stars but I love them for how cute and unique their facial features are. I\u2019ve seen them receive flak for it, but I disagree that Suhyun and Chanhyuk are ugly. They are easily some of the most good-looking Koreans I have ever seen. What makes it even sweeter is how as brother-sister, you can clearly see their resemblance to each other.I can relate to them. As an older sister, I have younger siblings whom I love but at the same time am exasperated with. Hearing them talk about how they were when younger and recount past fights while laughing over it or when they interact with each other on variety shows reminds me of my own sibling relationships and how much they are like my family. It helps me establish a sense of closeness to them.Lastly, their music videos are the best I\u2019ve ever seen. \u2018Re-Bye\u2019 has a theatre themed storyline with a twist at the end which always blows my mind because I couldn\u2019t see it coming. \u2018How People Move\u2019 has a crisp, bright aesthetic and is my favourite music video. It includes Escher\u2019s stairs as part of the set-up. \u2018Melted\u2019 is the story of a boy struggling to make it in the world and brings tears to my eyes. It\u2019s all so good. There are many more but these are the highlights. I\u2019d recommend anyone who\u2019s interested to listen to their music, these tunes for a start: How People MoveRe-ByePlay UglyMeltedDinosaurLast GoodbyeChocoladyTo end off, here\u2019s a cute picture of them.  Particularly, a picture of Lee Chanhyuk. Suhyun is amazing but he deserves more love.  ",

            "answer_text": "Oofity i can\u2019t name just one so i\u2019ll name my favorites Exo: These guys were the second k-pop group i ever really liked in terms of music AND their personalities probably my 3rd favorite group and btw for people that are thinking about going to their concerts let me tell you they are SO worth all the money and time! Bias: Baekhyun Bias wrecker: Chanyeol Bts: Yes i know this answer is prettyyyyy basic but i LOVE their music and their just hands down hilarious, and they were the first group that i awaited for their debut so knowing their fame now i feel like a proud mother. these guys deserve all the fame they have and people can have opinions but all together they have this fame and make thousands and you don\u2019t, so who\u2019s winning now? Bias: Jimin my baby UwU Bias wrecker: Yoongi, but these two ^^^^ switch a LOT Shinee: These guys have always been my bias group so when i found out jonghyun had passed i was devastated and felt extremely bad for not even noticing anything however i will still continue to support them especially since i can\u2019t imagine what the members must be going through especially since i would cry every day for months and yet i didn\u2019t even get to meet jonghyun and they have lived with him for YEARS Bias: Jonghyun Bias wrecker: Taemin Bigbang: Now these guys are what REALLY got me into k-pop, i even went to a few of their concerts in korea and it was lit. However even though i love them, what seungri did will never be ok, hopefully he didn\u2019t pull them down to much since all the other members don\u2019t deserve to have their careers ruined because one person made a mistake Bias: G-Dragon Bias wrecker: Top Mamamoo: These girls are OOZING with talent they are EXTREMELY underrated and deserve so much more fame like have you seen them perform? They are amazing and my number 1 favorite girl group Bias: Hwasa my wife Bias wrecker: Solar Twice: I seriously love their music, their music isn\u2019t exactly what i would usually listen to but i guess thats the reason why i love it, also i don\u2019t know why people hate signal, its a BOP and their comeback is amazing, iv\u2019e had fancy on replay for days, im not even kidding Bias: Dahyun Bias wrecker: Chaeyoung F(x): God i don\u2019t know where to start\u2026.these girls are the first ever girl group i stanned and i still love them to this day Bias: Amber my ultimate bias, and im not kidding when im saying i watch almost anything that has amber in it No one can beat amber, actually fight me Got7: Their music isn\u2019t my thing but that doesn\u2019t mean their not talented! Their: Talented, Hilarious, Down to earth and possibly some of the most beautiful people in the world, what more could you want? Bias: Yugyeom UwU Bias wrecker: Bambam Super Junior: Not much to say about these guys that i haven\u2019t already said a million times, their hilarious and extremely talented, their a whole package Bias: Heechul my bae (no bias wrecker, heechul is a GOD) Stray Kids: Ok so these guys are like mamamoo, EXTREMELY talented and underrated, like seriously guys stop sleeping on them, their music is catchy as hell and they have great charisma Bias: Oof i have never been able to choose between, han and felix their all just SO HOT So these are the groups i \u201cStan\u201d aka i have heard almost all of their songs, watch a lot of videos that have them in and stream their new songs, (try) to go to tours, and buy merchandise (Yes i didn\u2019t have basics like blackpink, snsd, red velvet nct ect, but let me say once again these are the groups i stan stan not the ones i listen to a few of their songs and videos, so just because i didn\u2019t put them in my list doesn\u2019t mean i don\u2019t like them) ",

            "answer_text": "I have so many favourite kpop groups because I listen to almost all genres and can\u2019t seem to settle with one. I guess each group that I stan have their own unique feature which really stands out to me. This is going to be a really really long answer! Boybands SHINee (Ultimate bias group) Their music varies across a wide range of genres including dubstep, deephouse and retro. Their ballads make you fall for them all over again. Their dancing is so powerful and sense of humour makes you want to watch all of their variety shows over and over again. EXO Their music is packed with energy and their ballads are just so emotional. They are funny, good-looking, above all, extremely talented! BTS There isn\u2019t one song I dislike by this group. Almost all of their songs involve a very very powerful dance and their variety skills and looks really are just an added bonus to their talent. They debuted under a small company but now look at them, they have so many international fans and are one of the most famous groups out there! BigBang They are CRAZY but in such a good way! All of their songs are so unique and I guess its because this group has such a wide range of distinguishable voices. You can easily tell apart the member singing a part of the song. Even though most of their songs as a group are energy filled and wild, most of the solo songs by each member are more tamed down and again, amazing to listen to. Seventeen Their songs are more \u201clight\u201d I guess and they are fun to listen to. Their dance skills, vocals and visuals are amazing. VIXX I watched the survival show MyDol and was impressed by a few members. But looking at them now, each of them have really just improved so much that they all are equally talented now! They are the kings of dark concepts. KNK When I first stumbled upon their songs, they were rookies then and the first thought that occurred to me was \u201cThey look like a bunch of models and actors rather than idols\u201d and so I didn\u2019t expect much. But their skills proved me wrong. They were excellent from the start and I love how they are getting more and more of the attention they deserve! Got7 It kind of took me a while to actually like this group but when I fell for them, I FELL HARD. I guess the thing that attracted me the most was the way they performed at variety shows and their interaction with fans. DBSK This was the first group that I found out due to a web series. I saw Changmin and wanted to find out more of his movies when I found out about DBSK. The duo is amazing because according to me they are the kings of Kpop. While Changmin is the king of Vocals, Yunho is the king of Dance. Wanna One Long story short, I watched produce101, saw how each of the members have their own skills, how beautifully they could work with each other and I fell in LOVE! Their visuals are no joke! These young boys just have so much talent and even though they are just a project group, they might actually leave a huge impact in the Kpop industry and I can\u2019t wait for more music from them! Girlgroups SNSD (Ultimate bias group) The first group that led me love korean music. I don\u2019t know why, but whenever I looked at this group I could only think of magic. Their songs are so magical and I really just love each one of them to bits. Each member have their own special skill that is displayed through solo activities. The fact that they are still so strong even after 10 years is something to be admired. With the recent rumors of three of the members leaving the agency, it is breaking my heart but one thing is for sure, I\u2019ll just keep loving them and supporting them the same that I\u2019ve been doing all these years. Apink I really just love their concepts. I find it so cute that they really suit the cuter and more innocent concepts despite their age. According to me, they are the funniest groups around and I never miss a single variety show appearance by them! Gfriend The most attractive thing about this group is their dance. No joke. Their dancing is one of the most powerful ones amongst girlgroups and is so beautiful to look at! Each member is such a cutiepie who really just transforms on stage. All of their songs are my favourites. WJSN/Cosmic girls I found out about this group only because of Yeonjung and I\u2019m so glad I did! Their music videos are their speciality and love how they bring out the cosmic feel in each of their videos! April One of the youngest groups around. Their songs are so deep yet their music videos are so cute! I found out about them only few months ago and I wish I had, sooner. Twice I watched the survival show Sixteen and saw how they all improved so much by the end of the show. JYP\u2019s choice was excellent and you can really see them improving more and more by every song! F(X) Honestly, this group is one of the best. It really hurts me that they don\u2019t get promoted enough because they have such unique vibes. Every song of theirs is a totally different concept! I want them to get the popularity and attention they deserve, and really just be known by everyone! EXID Every member in this group is equally talented and I don\u2019t see any reason to dislike them. Their songs are so catchy and makes you want to sing along everytime you hear them. BlackPink These monster rookies must have definitely found a place in everyone\u2019s heart. Since they release very few songs that too with a long delay, improvement can be seen with every music video. These rookies may have a lot to learn from the variety world, but their talent is really just WOW. Red Velvet Their songs are so unique. The tunes and beats and everything get you addicted to the songs. This is one group where learning the names of the members is just so hard despite the fact that there are just 5 members. Every song of theirs display each of the member\u2019s vocal strength and I think that is so cool! Mixed groups K.A.R.D Love at first sight. Remaining groups did take me atleast one song to figure out whether I liked the group or not but with K.A.R.D I just knew instantly that they would become one of my ultimate favourites! Their speciality has to be the fact that there are two versions for every song and every song has a point dance. They are still rookies but still have support from all parts of the world. It\u2019s going to be fun seeing these guys grow! AKDONG MUSICIAN These siblings are really the cutest!! I enjoy their music so much. Their voices complement each other\u2019s and it so nice hearing ballads from this group. Disbanded groups I\u2019ll miss each of these idols a lot as a group but ofcourse my support will always stay with each of the members as they carry on with their solo activities. Wonder girls They were going so strong even after many years of debuting. I did like many of their songs and even though they may not be my most favourite, their disbandment still hurt me a little. Sistar This honestly had to be the most shocking disbandment ever. I mean the news just came about out of the blue and I was just wondering what went wrong! Their songs were so addictive and I just enjoyed their comebacks. 2NE1 The end of an era. They were one of a kind, had such unique and strong concepts that many would fear to try. Their music was catchy and addictive and just perfect. Their powerful songs were just as amazing as their more ballad-type songs. I.O.I One of the most painful disbandments in history of kpop. I watched Produce101 and saw how extremely hardworking these girls were. They made some amazing music in a variety of concepts and I\u2019m glad that they made the most out of the time they were together as a group. Ofcourse, I like listening to more groups but I felt like these names had to be mentioned on the list. If you read the entire answer, thankyou so much \u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Personally mine would be these: EXO- My favorite group. They have been through so much and haven't stopped. They make me happy and there isn\u2019t a song I don\u2019t like. It feels like I\u2019ve been them with forever. SEVENTEEN- They are really funny. They make me laugh. They work so hard. And their songs and choreography are great. And the fandom is really sweet. SHINee- There isn\u2019t enough words to describe SHINee. They have had a member pass. That was devastating for lots of people. SHINee always works hard no matter what and there dancing is on another level. They couldn\u2019t be more perfect. Girl\u2019s Generation/SNSD- I\u2019ve actually known SNSD longer than any other group. And they\u2019ve also always been there for me. They are amazing too. Stray Kids- They have their upbeat songs and their meaningful songs. And that\u2019s what groups need. They are also really funny and work hard. Gfriend- Their song and choreography and song are always in sync. And you can tell just how hard they really work. Super Junior- I can\u2019t even with them. They are hilarious!! Their songs are amazing too!! NCT- NCT is on so many more levels. The different units are all so different and all produce such great music. When NCT came together as one to do \u201cBlack on Black\u201d it was so amazing!! They are just perfect!! GOT7- I have no words. Except that the fandom is one of the best out there with Carats. DAY6- They have such a variety of music and I love all of it. SF9- PERFECT ASTRO- Funny and perfect Nu\u2019est- They work so hard and are just so amazing! MONSTA X -FUNNY AND PERFECT I\u2019m not a huge girl group stan, but here\u2019s what I have that are different from other girl groups I\u2019ve heard: Blackpink and Twice- I\u2019m not huge on either but they both work hard. Red Velvet- Their concepts are always great! Pristin- They are great and really funny!!! Their songs are amazing and I love their choreography is fun to cover!! WJSN- They work super hard and their songs are always different from each other the dances are pretty hard.

Neonpunch- They debuted this year and their dance was really cool! Fromis_9- They just cameback with \u201cLove Bomb\u201d and it\u2019s different from what I heard first and I\u2019m in love with the song! Weki Meki- also cameback with \u201cCrush\u201d it\u2019s pretty catchy and I love it!! Lovelyz- Amazing!

            "answer_text": "I stan many of them so I am listing my favorites enjoy ;-) I WILL START WITH GIRL GROUPS 3. BLACKPINK  Now plz don\u2019t kill me \u2026honestly I hated them because I thought they were a replacement of 2NE1 (queens miss u T-T) but gradually I strarted liking them . The thing is that they\u2019re mistreated , YG treats them as models not artists and it really hurts. Favorite song - Stay Bias - Jisoo  Aaaaaah those visuals\u2026. Jisoo is the visual of group but people usually like her for her visuals only come on . I chose Jisoo as my bias becoz of her raspy voice and I am proud of my decision . She\u2019s a really good vocalist ( try to say something bad about her singing and I\u2019ll dissolve u in concentrated Hydrochloric acid ). Bias Wrecker - Rose  Again I have been attacked by powerful visuals . Rose has such a unique voice , people say that it\u2019s her fake voice but I like her warm voice. Again becoz of her amazing vocals she\u2019s my bias wrecker. move on to 2nd position 2. Twice  I love their cute concepts . Well I am the type of person who cringes seeing cut things but in case of these girls I LOVE THEIR CONCEPTS. Favorite song - Yes or yes & What is love Bias- Jihyo  She is AMAZING . Vocals are so powerful and visuals #dead . She\u2019s an amazing leader . Bias Wrecker - Jeongyeon  Also a great vocalist . She\u2019s so damn sexy #killmeplz . She deservs attention (Jihyo also). and my ULTIMATE GIRL GROUP IS *drumroll* 1.RED VELVET  I L O V E T H E M . Red velvet is the first girl group I stanned before that I used to think that girl gruop concepts are cringey but these girls changed my thoughts well I should say they destroyed my useless opinions about girlgroups. I love how they switch between their Red and Velvet concepts . Favorite song - basically each and every song but Bad Boy is superior Bias - OT5  So that\u2019s my girlgroup ranking now onto boy groups 3. TXT  favorite rookie group . My babies.T-T Favorite song - Run Away Bias - Beomgyu  HE IS HELLA CUTE PERIODT Bias wrecker - Yeonjun  at firt I accidently thougt him of V\u2026. I MEAN THEY ARE SO IDENTICAL so next group is 2. EXO  IT GOES DOWN DOWN BABY \u2026\u2026 oops sry I can\u2019t control myself . Actually my mind was conflicting between EXO and the groupon 1st position becoz I LOVE BOTH OF THEM . I miss ot12 T-T. They are vocal powerhose . I really love their winter ballads . Favorite song - Monster & Universe Bias - Bacon aka Baekhyun  Love Shot was the first EXO song I heard and at the very beggening I was like wait this voice \u2026.. is this Jungkook umm well that was me but u have to agree their voices are really similar and from that day I was attracted to him . I listened to more of his voice and now he\u2019s my favorite vocalist in K pop . Not only voice but he has such a funny personality I mean him and Chen together can make a person deaf EASILY. MEANWHILE\u2026\u2026. Kim JongWae XD aka Chen (from a distance) - Aaawaeeee XD anyways I am really happy for Chen , and haters calm your tits becoz no one is going to listen to your rantings . Bias Wrecker - Suho  EXO\u2019s eomma aka divorced single mother aka Kim Junmyeon XD. ATTACKED BY VISUALS . His voice is so soothing aaah . He\u2019s a great leader controlling his LOUD AF kids XD. moving on to no. 1 *drumrolls* 1.BTS  My seven lovable , adorable , lovely *insert jimin\u2019s voice*, cute and sexy dorks . BTS brought me into K pop. The first song I listened was Mic Drop Remix . At first I thought they usually made songs like Idol, DNA, MIC DROP etc but one day I was really stressed I even thought of killing myself , then I found their song Magic Shop \u2026.. Their music healed me . At first I was just a fan who liked their music but gradually I felt connected to them , seeing them happy made me happy , seeing them crying made me cry , they made me laugh and it felt like family and I\u2019m extremely grateful that I am a part of ARMY and I can share their pain , happiness and everything. BTS I PURPLE YOU ... Favorite song - LITRELLY EVERY SONG Bias- OT7  THAT\u2019S IT ",

            "answer_text": "Well my favorite K-pop group is either BTS, Blackpink or Twice. They are all awesome and talented but I would prefer Blackpink because of their song\u2019s concept. I know all the bad things people say about them so I could reassure you that I know about it and still support them. Although Blackpink doesn\u2019t write their song lyrics their are other groups out there too that doesn\u2019t write their lyrics including Twice and even BTS. BTS only write their rap they don\u2019t write their lyrics though. It seems like to me that since Blackpink is the most popular girl group people are targeting their weakness like \u201cOMG they don\u2019t write their own lyrics\u201d! and \u201cThey don\u2019t nearly have as much songs as other groups there Overrated! Well ever heard the phrase Quality over Quantity ? I know that in Korea there stage presence is not that well but its because they probably feel pressure because of Korea\u2019s harsh judgements. But, in America they rock the stage they do things they don\u2019t do in Korea because of one reason Americans doesn\u2019t judge them as much which doesn\u2019t give them pressure and which makes their performance rock. I know that their fandom is like toxic but its a good thing because its good to know only four girls could make people support them that much I actually feel proud of this fandom. These girls deserve so much more than what they have right now I hope an old blink like me would make you change your minds about Blackpink right now\u2026 I just hope things would improve for them..

            "answer_text": "I asked myself the same question few years back before I became a K-pop admirer. As a foreigner, now living in Korea, I don\u2019t root for any of the big guys, so I hope my answer is fair and from a distance. In Korea, in your daily life, you will hear mostly girls groups playing while shopping in malls or eating out. Twice, Red Velvet, F(x), etc. The ladies are giving the boys a run for their money when it comes to popularity, winning awards, and coming up with new musical styles. In the men\u2019s category, currently BTS and EXO are everywhere. Nevertheless, The one song I heard more often is Untitled 2014 by Kwon Jo Yong, aka G-Dragon. It came out back in April and you can still hear it everywhere. I asked many Koreans of all ages if they know who GD is and everyone does. They know his name, his face, his songs, even in the bowels of the vegetable market\u2026 the 80-year old ladies know who GD is\u2026 Outside of Korea, boys groups have a larger following. Statistically, TVXQ is in the Guinness world-book or records for having the largest fan club in the world. BTS is the most tweeted musical act of 2017 world-wide, and that includes beating Bieber, Despacito, and so forth. So as far as size goes, world-wide, I would say, first came Psy, than TVQX, than BIG BANG, than BTS. If we just refer to Korea, the interests are different, and EXO most probably wins there today. At a stadium music festival in Korea I witnessed the actual competition between fan clubs. Present were: Psy, BTS, a mini-version of EXO, and Sechs Kies, plus many others. In order of loudness, chants and enthusiasm, BTS wins by a mile. As far as numbers, Sechs Kies pretty much conquered the stadium, and Psy got the loudest standing ovation. So depending on demographics, geographics and allegiances, you will get different answers. My personal ranking \u2026 if it matters \u2026 between the groups, BTS wins for influence and universality worldwide - for taking k-pop to a new level today. BIG BANG wins for geniality, disruption, and sheer indisputable talent - a classic anywhere you go. EXO wins for talent, consistency and loyalty. TVXQ wins for talent, power and vision - paving the road for a new musical environment. But then, there are so many others old and new, Girls Generation, Super Junior, Cnblue, Shinee and Taemin, Got 7, Seventeen, Wanna One, Monsta X, just to name a few \u2026 new talent debuts everyday and competition is fierce. But K-pop is an unprecedented phenomenon, and nothing can stop it now. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there i\u2019m Jugyeong from ARMY, BLINK, ETC. And i\u2019ll be telling you the biggest k-pop group. So get ready and BUCKLE UP! Cause here we go! (Yes i know Jay from the kubz scouts xD) Well in terms in k-pop speaking\u2026I\u2019d say either BTS (Bangtan) Or Blackpink! Okay okay, not much of a surprise considering there hard work and others, but to think about it there are other groups who are just as popular not just BTS or Blackpink. BTS lately has gotten quite popular over the years. If you think about it hard enough they really weren\u2019t popular back in 2013, because they were a small group and still Bighit were looking for members to create the BTS group per say. Okay you\u2019re not getting to the topic Jugyeong! Please i need to know!! :( Okay\u2026Sorry! So as i was saying\u2026BTS has gotten over a lot of attention not for there looks but for there music, hard work, amazing talents, ETC! They even got billboard and have there 2 movies! It is so amazing! They also have a huge fanbase considering there fans range from ages to 10\u201316. And yeah there are younger army people forget. There are old army like 16\u201320 or more but not the point. BLACKPINK! Now no hate on them because lately i\u2019ve seen videos like Jennie being lazy or dancing\u2026But i\u2019ll explain that first. Firstly\u2026Jennie might have looked lazy or not as happy as the others. No it could have not been that the songs are old\u2026Or that she was getting tired. Most k-pop idols get tired but still try and do amazing at work even on stage. Jennie might have been sad or depressed because of something personal. If i were to know what i think it would been causing stuff at home. Now that is cleared up lets move on  (Seen here Jennie was in the mood and hyped up for her song SOLO) Blackpink has gotten more popular lately because of Jennie\u2019s song solo. As a BLINK i should know. (Links of BLINKS dancing to SOLO are down below) Jennie\u2019s solo song has been inspiring to young and old and teen BLINKS. Even multi-fandoms.  (This one was my favorite! JUST LOOK AT THERE OUTFITS AND THE WAY THEY DANCED LIKE QUEEN? :) )  (She has amazing dance covers go check her out on Youtube!)  (This one just really blew my mind. I loved it so much!)  (Of course gotta put in Jennie\u2019s video. Like she is queen!! SLAY! XD) Blackpink also had done a collab video with Dua Lipa. Featuring the song \u201cKiss and Make up\u201d  (The song) And yeah that is just about it. Red Velvet, Twice, ETC are also really popular as well as Got7, seventeen, Stray Kids, ASTRO, and so on and so forth. ",

            "answer_text": "Monsta X \u2764\ufe0f  I literally just finished watching Episode 3 of Monsta X Ray \u2014 Season 2. They all have this aura that is so irresistible! It is something about these guys that really absorbs me in like a sponge and it's a very heartfelt thing. They haven't placed #1 in a music award yet but I can most definitely feel it coming soon. It's the same feeling I got when I first discovered BTS. They literally struggled to get views on their music now they are out here achieving goals that they never even imagined setting (with the BBMAs being the prime example). Monsta X will be achieving big goals someday too! I must squeeze this in\u2026it takes a lot of patience to babysit a bunch of active kids, but Monsta X was able to master the role. It took trial and error but thats natural.  I already mentioned this in a recent answer about Jooheon but I will briefly recap. He starved and was held hostage in the past. He never had the freedom to be himself, metaphorically, he was living the life as a circus Tiger (its basically like coming out to perform under the master\u2019s command, then going back into his cage for the rest of the day). His animal like aura is so strong that he was the only person who connected with an animal on the first try in Episode 2 of Monsta X Ray. Barya (the sea elephant) basically became a Monbebe on sight because she would not stop following Jooheon around. The aquarist even said that she never popped her head above the glass\u2026.ever!  Just look at the eye contact she's making with him\u2026I understand how you feel Barya. Wonho\u2019s family would spent their hard earned paychecks to give him the future he always wanted. They loved and cherished their son so much that they would give every dime they had left to make him happy, now he's out here making them proud of him. I.M. traveled so much due to his father being a scientist, therefore, it was very difficult for him to make mingle with others and create a friendship. Even when he was announced as a member of Monsta X, he had a hard time bonding with all the other members. Imagine how hard that was, he surely felt lonely. People judged Minhyuk and said that he would never be an idol or at least successfully get as far as he did right now, but guess what haters? He proved you all wrong! Those four place an inspirational theme to their lives due to their rough pasts. I love it when people escape harsh reality and move forth to focus on their future. Monsta X seem like such a very humble group, besides the fact that Jooheon lies on Starship by saying that they won't let him show his abs, which I think is funny. Also their fandom is very chill but I think it will get out of hand once they gain more exposure. Other than that, I love these guys dearly! Monsta X hwiting! ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite KPop group is Big Bang. Why? BECAUSE they are FANTASTIC! I could give a rat\u2019s patootie about all this \u2018oh, they are so sweet, they work good together, they love each other\u2019 crap if the MUSIC isn\u2019t any good!!! And if the music IS wonderful I don\u2019t care if the guys making it aren\u2019t innocent, sweet, pure babies who \u2018love each other\u2019. OKAY? Now if they\u2019d, you know, MURDERED someone, or were proven rapists (no, nobody in Big Bang falls into either category - do not believe slanderous slur jobs released by gossip rags) that would be different. I, along with Hongki BTW, am over Choi Jong Hoon of FT Island - cause rapist. Damn good guitar player but sorry, no thanks. Big Bang? Seungri left the group (even tho I don\u2019t really care about what he did that much because guess what, he was NOT really involved with JJY\u2019s crap at all) so why hate on the group? Sheesh. I have yet to hear a Big Bang song I don\u2019t like, okay? GDragon is a phenomenal songwriter, T.O.P. has this sexy deep voice when he raps and I like hearing him sing. Daesung is the damn voice of Big Bang - just wow. Taeyang also has a great voice and some songwriting skills. I own Rise, I also own The Great Seungri - which is a wonderful album BTW despite whatever the boy did or didn\u2019t do. You know who else I love? CN Blue. I\u2019m so over the top FURIOUS at these lousy little netizens sitting in internet cafes thinking they can just decide who to throw out a window. They are BULLIES of the worst order. I\u2019m so upset about Lee Jung Hyun being forced to leave. Thank all the deities that little uptight puritans didn\u2019t have the power to destroy groups like Led Zeppelin back in the day - we\u2019d have lost so much great music. This young man has been confused with the FT Island rapist right from the beginning, and none of the little idiots whining about him have even bothered to fact-check a thing. So Oh MY he acted like the ROCK STAR he is back 4 years ago, and then dropped JJY as a friend like a hot potato when the GF made those accusations. That\u2019s his \u2018crime\u2019 - the cops and the Japanese don\u2019t give a flying F!%!% - I doubt any Americans do either BTW. Anyway, I\u2019m a bit upset about things right now. I do like the way KPop wants their idols to be family friendly (at least overtly), be discrete is what that used to be called - and I also like that celebrities acknowledge their fans on a pretty deep level in SK. It\u2019s very nice to see a talented group like BTS who are hugely creative, responsible, civic-minded young people who are great friends with each other. Very nice. Just not necessary for me to like their music or performances. I also like it when groups write their own stuff, have a hand in creating their own material (dance, rap, song lyrics, melodies, concepts, production, etc). BUT again not necessary for me to really enjoy the music and performances. ",

            "answer_text": "(Initially I was asked why I stan my favorite groups. I\u2019m answering that) I\u2019ve criticized my groups more than praised them whoops. I guess I do that cause they already got a buttload of fans that literally worship them. But I\u2019ve never properly answered this question before so here it goes: BTS. Technically, Gdragon and PSY were my first impressions of kpop, but BTS genuinely amused me and I admired their dancer, Jhope. I really enjoy watching people dance. And I like too many BTS songs, so might as well stan them. Monsta X. Second group I cared about, and they quickly became my favorite. I related with their personalities better. And I like their more intense music style (I\u2019m a metal and alt rock fan outside kpop). Plus, the rappers are hard to beat. BlackPink. I thought they were stupid and I hated their songs. At first. Somehow, they grew on me, especially Lisa. I thought her accent sounded pretty cool when she rapped. And I was sick of aegyo concepts from gg, so\u2026 BP made my list. ATEEZ. I was an off and on fan in their fetus days. But I started consistently following after \u201cSay My Name\u201d. What really drew me into this group was their outstanding stage presence. They are hilarious! VIXX. Initially, I just thought they were stupid edgelords trying to be scary (which they kinda are lol). But then youtube was like, \u201chey look at this DANCE by their leader\u201d. And so I slammed the stan button. I love their dance style and main vocalists. And I admire their company\u2019s eagerness to test the kpop boundaries. And their fandom is literally the best. ",

            "answer_text": "PentagonDropping this to prove you why I love them:  You will be surprised if I say that this is a self-produced and self-choreographed title song from their fourth mini album (excl. Japanese album) a month before they celebrate their first anniversary as an established group. The group has that color you\u2019ll never get in other groups. They have members who already became trainees since 2nd gen groups are trending. Their height difference, their overall talents, their visuals, and their personalities\u2026 There are only two members in this group who haven\u2019t showcased their self-composed songs yet, and they are foreigners. This is legitimately the first group which all members wreck up my ultimate bias list because they are all so extraordinary. They are also the first group in which I like all the rap line\u2019s rapping style. They have stayed as my ultimate group for around 4 months now and you won\u2019t regret knowing these guys. You\u2019ll really regret sleeping on them. BTS  Credits for them to make me wanna jump into the K-Pop world. I really like their music style, the originality they have, the bond they have as a group, and one thing that really amaze me the most is the way they can make all members sound so good when singing their songs. Their songs are surely of high quality, especially HYYH. Oh, and despite being a stan since WINGS era, I love them because of their super awesome debut song: No More Dream. You really gotta check that song, and N.O too! GOT7  I know this group from BTS, actually. Their music is pretty much good for me and they are beagle-dols! They also have Defsoul and Ars to produce their songs. Same as BTS, each members are also very connected, and I feel like what I see on camera is their true selves. Seventeen  The way they send their emotions of a song written and composed by a member (Woozi) through its choreography done by a member (Hoshi) made me completely slipped into the diamond life, although it was only for a while. The amount of respect I put on this group is just beyond any groups I\u2019ve ever known because they managed to show me that a 1-year group can look like an established old group (watched them for the first time on MMA 2016, I really thought they were sunbaenims!). All members are so, so formidable, and their musics are HQ most of the time, especially subunit songs. BTOB  This group is so far the only one that made me feel so nostalgic and amazed since I knew about them 4 years ago, and I was not a K-Pop fan at that time! You\u2019ll think that there are normal members here while there are not a single one of them who is normal, especially that popular actor on the left. Sure, they don\u2019t have that visual quality new gen fans adore nowadays, but all the members\u2019 talents and humbleness are on another level (and also their dorkiness). They are not just the king of ballad. Seeing these guys daily will burn your tummy\u2019s calories because they are very hilarious. I also like MAMAMOO (vocal quality, the \u2018quietness and reservedness\u2019 they have, queens of imitating styles), CLC (versatility, visuals, talents, the same dorkiness fellow Cube artists (former or staying) inherited), Bolbbalgan4 (song quality), and Rainz (Hong Eunki, b e a g l e s).

            "answer_text": " 1.THE BOYZ (my ult) I love their songs and I love that they are crackheads, their songs make me happy also:) I loved how they showed their true colors in the Generation Z film!  2. NCT (all units) I love all units they come out with amazing b-sides and title tracks and also crackheads. They are my second ult group. When I\u2019m down, I watch videos of them being crackheads and it brightens my day in a way:)  3. Stray Kids (ot8) I really enjoy listening and their music helps me in a way of difficulty (that probably makes zero sense), Lately I\u2019ve been going through a hard time so Stray Kids brings me positivity through their music.  4)Oneus their music gives me great vibes and I really like their raps. Oneus\u2019s music is also creative and that\u2019s one of the things I like about Oneus.  5. IZ*ONE I loved their debut song but I also love their other songs I will be truly sad when they disband, they deserve better. But hopefully each member will have a good career after they disband.  6. ATEEZ I can\u2019t wait for their comeback I also like their choreography\u2019s and their songs are really good, my favorite is Wave. Ateez has amazing songs that I could listen to on repeat everyday.  7. Wanna One although Wanna One disbanded, it doesn\u2019t stop me from loving them, they deserved better. I really miss Wanna One and I hope they could comeback one day.  8. Twice I really like all of their concepts, they rock each one in opinion:) Twice\u2019s music is really good whichever concept or style, I\u2019ll enjoy it either way:)  9. Kard I really like their music, they have potential in my opinion They are very talented:)  10. Day6 Day6 has Very good music. Their music really surprised me at first and I listen to them very often as well as every other group I put on this list. I hope Day6 is doing well while on hiatus. These are my top 10 groups, yes I do listen to them very often, almost everyday and I enjoy listening to their music a lot. edit: so I just wanted to make it clear for stray kids I am ot8 and I do not support w**jin at all.

            "answer_text": "- Monsta X : they got me into this world and will be favs until I leave it (I hope it will never happened). Their music is totally matching my taste, I one of the lucky one who found her perfect group musically talking. But it\u2019s not only their music.  They are talented babies, they are getting recognition because they are nice people, well known and very popular among other idols, actors and entertainers, to be sweet and treating everyone with respect, no matter if they are rookies or seniors. In addition, they are what I call a family. Groups like that are going to be forever, without losing a member, are able to work amazingly together. It\u2019s something I feel only with a few group, which are Monsta X, BAP, VIXX and Seventeen. Those who have not only face difficulties but who have also fought against each other in order to debut (or in BAP case, faced something so bad that it almost killed literally three of them). Groups like that are diffusing a real harmony and you feel so great when you see them together. These seven boys are going to change the kpop world, making a whole tsunami, they are already creating their waves. \u201cKpop isn\u2019t a fight, it\u2019s a fair competition\u201d. - Seventeen : Is it link to what I said above ? Probably. Anyway, I discovered Seventeen thanks to Monsta X and I have a single thing to say : bless this friendship.  Seventeen are hardworker babies who saved their whole agency with their 26 babies arms. As say above, they, too, are a real family. Such a big group would not work like they do if they weren\u2019t loving each other as their brother, it has been show with groups like SuJu or ToppDogg. I have great hope in their future. - A.C.E : Who are they ? The future. A.C.E are amazing boys who have seen their hope being crushed. They didn\u2019t give up and they are here today. Can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s going to happened tomorrow.  - Nu\u2019est : Nu\u2019est have been on top, dropped so low that people though they were disbanded and came back to be the most popular Kpop group in Korea. No explanation needed. Nu\u2019est are shining. They didn\u2019t gave up, they throwed their whole hope into their fans and LOVE heard them. They are one of the most peaceful and beautiful group I know. I just feel so great when I watch them  That\u2019s it. Otherwise I have a lot of other groups I like but don\u2019t really follow or don\u2019t follow anymore and don\u2019t call myself *fandom name* ; Got7 : They were one of the first group I followed, but their musics didn\u2019t really matched my taste and I ended up dropping them. I have a lot of affection for this group, I feel really sweet when I think about themVIXX : I don\u2019t really know why I dropped them but I think it\u2019s just I wasn\u2019t interested in their style anymore. I have a lot of respect for them tho, not only as kpop group you know, just\u2026 when I see them I want to bow very low and kiss their feet.BTS : Their music isn\u2019t really matching my taste currently. Added to the whole hype and negative aspect of it, I ended up being more and more uninterested by everything they were doing so I stopped following them before I get just annoyed by them. Stay the good memories I suppose. It\u2019s a group I didn\u2019t really stopped following by choice so it\u2019s a little bit bitter.BAP : My sister is a huge Baby and talking with her ended me being interested into them. But I don\u2019t follow them, I just have a strong feeling of affection and I would love to hug them one by one so hard, and patting their head saying \u201cit\u2019s going to be alright, you did well\u201d.And in general I like the work of : SuJu, SHINee, EXO, Up10tion, NCT, Twice, WJSN, Pentagon, SF9, Infinite, Sonamoo, Sistar (TT-TT), Day6, Shinhwa, N.Flying, KNK, Pristin, and probably a lot other I can\u2019t remember. I always wonder if someone read my posts fully ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an individual\u2019s opinion. For me it\u2019s Astro. I have followed lots of groups, but I did not find anyone as best as ASTRO. Like, ASTRO is a complete package. It\u2019s not been too long since I started following them. It was December 2018. I was watching My I.D. is a Gangnam Beauty, and Cha Eun Woo\u2019s visual led me to the group. I started watching ASTRO\u2019s mv, their funny videos, their live performance videos, they were all awesome. I mean, they really are something. Each member of the group has his own talent. Like, MJ, he is good at impersonation, while Jinjin is a good drummer. Well, Cha Eun Woo and Moonbin both know how to play piano as well as they are good at acting. Also, Rocky is the best dancer and Sanha is the best guitarist. I mean that, besides singing, they have their own talent, and these talented boys need more recognition. Its really sad to say that ASTRO is one of the most underrated boy group. However, they are gaining popularity slowly, but not getting famous as they deserve to be. The best thing about the group is that they are really close to one another. They care and help one another a lot. Especially, Sanha (maknae) gets a lot of care by his hyungs, as he is the youngest in the group. Another fact about the group which I love is the two oldest members, MJ and Jinjin, they act like the youngest ones. MJ, also known as a happy virus of the group, along with Jinjin are so playful and always keep their members happy. On the other hand, Sanha, who is the maknae, is very savage to his hyungs. I feel so happy and entertaining when he messes around with older members. It\u2019s kind of cute and interesting. While Cha Eun Woo is like the father of the group. He is a calm member but also very mischievous from inside. He usually takes care of the members more. Talking about Moonbin, he is a sportsperson of the group, and his attitude is like so daring that he is not afraid of anything. Lastly Rocky, he and Moonbin have been trainees for like 7 years together. So, its pretty obvious, those two are very close. Both of them are good at dancing. They even have make choreos of their songs by themselves. They are very talented as well as pure-hearted people. Recently, they have won first prize for their first album and they were beyond happiness. Also, just 2 days ago, they made a Japan debut, and it was a huge success for them. See, these boys deserve to get more attention and recognition. Follow them, you won't regret. #arohafighting #astro #aroha <3 ",

Monsta X  I could write an entire essay about them, but I\u2019ll just say they have the visuals, the dancers, the rappers, the personalities and the vocals to blow your mind and I\u2019m proud that they\u2019re one of my ultimates. 5. Seventeen  13 is a lucky number, isn\u2019t it? 4. EXO  EXO has such a large place in my heart, not to mention my ult bias, who is Chen is also an EXO member. Once you start stanning them, you never go back. Their music is awesome. 3. Blackpink  AAAHHHHH I CAN\u2019T EXPRESS HOW MUCH I LOVE THESE GIRLS! They\u2019re my ultimate Girl group and I love them to the moon and back and to the moon and back again. They are the only girl group that is in my ults despite me standing quite a lot of girl groups (more than 15). I will skewer anybody who dares to hate on them. 2. Stray Kids  Another essay is in order for SKZ. I\u2019ve been a stay for almost a year now and they\u2019ve really been a big part of my Kpop world :D 1.NCT  What we\u2019ve all been waiting for is finally here! Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, my ultimate group is NCT. I\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t have an Ot21 picture, but these boys are my everything and I love them so, so much. They\u2019ve been my ult group ever since I started stanning them, about a year ago and that will never change. I support every single one of them, and Haechan is my bias. In the crackhead NCTzen fandom, there are inside jokes, amazing songs, 21 and counting loveable boys, an amazing concept and a close bond between the fans and the members. I\u2019m telling you, there is very minimal toxicity and the fans are all welcoming and will make you feel comfortable as part of the fandom in no time. You\u2019ll never regret stanning NCT. Well, that was a long answer, and I\u2019m sorry if it wasn't what you are looking for, but these are my favourite kpop groups, even though I stan more that 45 groups. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cbest\u201d. You can\u2019t compare a group that\u2019s been around for 10 or 12 years to a group that just debuted. I have \u201cfavorites\u201d. That doesn\u2019t mean the groups I like are better than the groups other people like. I can see a lot of BTS fans answering this however unless you know tons of KPop groups how can you compare? Not including disbanded groups my top 4, in order, have been in place for years - ShinEE, Vixx, Infinite, and Super Junior. That is not to say they\u2019re better than other groups, just that I personally like them more. I can\u2019t even keep track of the new groups! If you want to add in groups who play instruments CNBlue, FTISland and Day 6. That doesn\u2019t mean my phone or iPod doesn\u2019t have 2PM or Got7 or Seventeen or BAP or EXO or Monsta X or Beast or even, yes, BTS on them. I like vocals and harmonies so my top groups reflect that. I also like groups who sound the same live as they do recorded. I also like groups who dance and remember their choreography (watch weekly idol and see how many groups forget their own dance moves because the song was two comebacks ago. It\u2019s also important to me that the groups really like each other (yes, they all look like they do as they are packaged to look like they are best friends but there are some groups who don\u2019t hang out outside of work and I don\u2019t understand how you can eat, sleep and live with people for years and then just not be friends outside of an MV or concert. When Kim Jonghyun died the main mourned was Choi Min Ho, that\u2019s how close ShinEE is to each other (main mourner is meant only for family so that means a lot). But mostly if it\u2019s about the music, as I said, put out great songs and I\u2019m your fan. The order in which I like groups isn\u2019t that important and to objectively say this group is better than that group or this group is the best is what starts fan wars. I don\u2019t need to justify my favorite group, they\u2019re just my favorite and they don\u2019t have to be anyone else\u2019s. If I\u2019m pulling out a song that is 10 years old and I still love it that justifies why my favorite groups are what they are. ",

            "answer_text": "What IS the best K-POP band in the world? This question is in-fact close to a year and yet, I\u2019m still being requested to answer. How do we even judge this? Currently there are 5 collapsed answers from last year, and most of them say what??? BTS and SNSD. Does that mean they\u2019re the best? Why do questions like this arise? Is it for bragging rights among other K-POP fans? A means to walk like there\u2019s a sore under your arm-pits and show your pride in your K-POP group being \u201cthe best\u201d? Back up please. Let\u2019s see a hypothetical situation: Let\u2019s say for argument sake that the best way to determine the best at something is to find how \u201cpopular\u201d it is, and how much money it has mustered compared to other groups, globally. And let\u2019s just say it\u2019s BTS coz the majority of KPOP fans just love hearing that, don\u2019t they? Would that make them the best?  Look at movies: The highest grossing movie in the world is currently Avatar (grossing 2.7Billion!). Would you call it \u201cthe best\u201d? With the likes of Avengers Infinity War that seemed to break the internet, could you even make this a fair deduction? What does the best even mean? That all other contending movies are not \u201cgood enough\u201d, or they don\u2019t captivate the crowd as much as Avatar? Enough Questions. This is usually a common question when fan wars are happening. It\u2019s a good question to express hate and rage among others. This is because they want other K-POP fans to recognize their idols and acknowledge them as better than all others. Let me go on to say this: BTS is not the best K-POP group in the world. (Actually upon writing this, BLACKPINK are infact more popular than BTS). Let\u2019s add some pictures, coz quora users love those:  SNSD is not the best K-POP group in the world.  There is no BEST group in the world. Yes. Come at me you all. Rain down your rage on me for my despicable acts of violence against your Oppas and Sunbaenim\u2019s or whatever you call them. The truth of the matter is that art is subjective, and treating it objectively would express a lack of perspective towards the other group. You know deep down that Avatar is not as captivating as Infinity War, so the highest grossing movie doesn\u2019t make it the best, going by that standard. Please stop with the comparisons. Put aside the need to put one above the other, because they are all their own style. I understand that they are all under K-POP, but it isn\u2019t imperative to try and find the best. BTS is good in their own regard. Same with EXO, GOT7, BLACKPINK, 9MUSES, G-IDLE\u2026. you get it. Why does this question come up actually? If you are truly interested and invested in the music a certain artist produces, you\u2019d have little to no time to bother if he\u2019s the best. Heck, if they\u2019re the worst in the world, wouldn\u2019t you still listen to them? People bring 2 very mutually exclusive groups independent of each other, and compare them\u2026. again, pictures: We have MAMAMOO  and G-IDLE  They are both really good. They are both dedicated to their work, and they bring out one of the best of sounds there is. To put one over the other, is to rob one of it\u2019s artistic prowess. A means of undermining one\u2019s work. Try to imagine how JYP or any other KPOP inclined agency representative would respond to this. If you asked them, what would they say? This question is quite dangerous if answered incorrectly, which is funny as there is no correct answer. Your best artist is the best artist. Cheers! ",

Who is it?    SUPER JUNIOR. Like HAVE YOU HEARD OF THEIR SONGSSSSS Sorry Sorry (such a bOp)Mr. SimpleBlack Suit (yes I skipped ahead a bit)I Think I (I personally LOVE this)The Crown (the lyricsss)Super Clap2YA2YAO! (Omg stream 2YA2YAO!)And of course, many, many moreI LOVEEEE each of their visuals, charms, and personalities especially: Eunhyuk and Donghae\u2019s dancing. My goodness. Love D&E. Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung\u2019s voices. KRY is like THE most amazing vocal unit EVER. Leeteuk. No words. AMAZING leader. (Koongie is so cute <3) Heechul (my bias), I thank God for your existence. Congrats and stay strong. Siwon. Thank you for your work and dedication to UNICEF. I respect you so much. (Sorry, I\u2019m only familiar with OT9, since I\u2019m still a new ELF. I\u2019m sure Sungmin, Kibum, Kangin, Hangeng, Henry, and Zhoumi are great people as well.) Of course, I\u2019m not saying that only D&E is good at dancing, KRY is good at singing, or anything like that. I just thought they were exceptional and should be mentioned. I really love each and every one them and their dedication to ELFs. If you want to hear about my opinion of their charms, you can see my answer to \u201cWho do you think is the visual hole in Super Junior\u201d or something like that. Yes, it\u2019s very off-topic. Sorry about that. - - \u2026 you thought I was done, right? Sorry. I still have my girl group left. (Lmao honestly I thought I was done too) Girl Group These ladies aren\u2019t as old as Super Junior (well of course not), but it\u2019s been 5 years since they debuted. Their songs and choreos are very catchy, but makes SUCH bops like WOW. It\u2019s also a 9 member group with a cute concept, but they actually are very good with a sexy, badass, or cool concept. This is just obvious now.    I\u2019ll just put 3 pics to match SuJu. It\u2019s TWICE. Once again, their bops: Like Ooh-Ahh (yes it\u2019s not really considered a bop compared to their other songs but it\u2019s actually really good)Cheer Up (shy shy shy, joreujima, etc.)TT (this is the song with the most views for the MV for TWICE)Likey (likey likey likey)Yes or Yes (I LOVED their style and and the tune is so good)FANCY (Chaeyoung was killing it)Feel Special (you make me feel specialllll)This group is pure talent and visuals. Why do people think they\u2019re too cute? It\u2019s their concept. Besides, pretty much everyone is doing a cool/badass concept now. I was honestly AMAZED at: Chaeyoung\u2019s rapping since Sixteen.Mina, Jihyo, and Jeongyeon\u2019s vocals.Momo the dancing mochine xDNayeon and Sana\u2019s aegyo.Dahyun\u2019s humour.And I want to say Tzuyu\u2019s visuals but I don\u2019t want to make things controversial. But yeah. I mean like they\u2019re all super pretty.Once again, I\u2019m not saying that these members are only good at that, or that no one else is good at it as well. They\u2019re obviously multitalented. Also sorry if any of you got offended or anything when I just said \u201caegyo\u201d or \u201chumour\u201d or \u201cvisuals\u201d for Nayeon, Sana, Dahyun, and Tzuyu. All nine members are exceptional at multiple things, and I wanted to say the ones that stood out to me from Sixteen. No wait that didn\u2019t get me anywhere. Well I hope you know what I mean. They\u2019re great. Like seriously. Anyways these groups are visuals, talent, and charms. I didn\u2019t write anything about TWICE\u2019s charms yet, but I will when I see a chance. Of course, these groups aren\u2019t the only groups that are AMAZING, but the question was about my ults and I\u2019m trying not too get too off-topic this time. As always, if I said anything rude or offensive or made a mistake (as in facts not my opinions), please let me know! I accept all opinions, so feel free to say anything about my answer in the comments, but please try to be respectful. Sorry for the really long answer, and have a great day! Btw stream 2YA2YAO! and Feel Special or anything else you like!!! :) ",

            "answer_text": "GFriend, or \uc5ec\uc790\uce5c\uad6c (Yeojachingu) in Korean, stand out among K-Pop groups, with a number of songs better than anything I have heard from any of their rivals, and I find them much more musically satisfying than other groups. In addition to that their main vocalist, Yuju, has exceptional talent, they don\u2019t use Autotune, their dances are generally regarded as setting the standard among Korean girl groups, and you won\u2019t find a lovelier bunch of girls anywhere. Some people complain that all their songs are the same, which is not true; they are always different musically, but GFriend have a characteristic sound (which they don\u2019t always stick to), with strings and other \u201creal\u201d instruments. It doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone, but as a classical music lover I like it and feel that it gives them more scope for expressiveness and colour. Another thing I like about them is that, unlike most other K-Pop groups, they don\u2019t ruin their songs with rap. GFriend\u2019s best songs don\u2019t instantly stick in the memory and that is one of their great strengths; instead of simple tunes and a lot of repetition they tend to have long, wide ranging melodies, interesting harmony and some very good counterpoint, and increasing familiarity brings richer rewards rather than boredom. They transcend conventional pop genres, and Time for the Moon Night is one that I don\u2019t consider to be a pop song at all; it is a genuine art song worthy of comparison with the very best from any time and from anywhere in the world. Start with Rough, Time for the Moon Night and, for something different from the usual GFriend sound, Fingertip. If you listen enough times to really know the songs you will probably end up loving them because they are so outstanding. The more recent Sunrise, and the new Japanese song, Flower (March 2019), are very good too. With songs like these they could become very popular among people of all ages all over the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Because everyone else is doing top 10, so I\u2019m going to, too, because picking just one is more difficult than finding that damn lost sock so yeet. BTS - Did they pave the way? Yes. They allowed Kpop and Korean culture to move more into the western world and allowed many groups in smaller companies to become more well known, like Cube Entertainment groups, Pledis groups, Starship, etc. They also introduced a lot of people into Kpop, myself included. And we enjoy some meme bois at every given time.My bias is Taehyung, not because he\u2019s handsome but because when I first got into BTS, I really liked how wide his vocal range was and how his voice sounds.Stray Kids - I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve released a single song that hasn\u2019t blown my mind, pre-debut songs included. Bang Chan is JYP\u2019s pride and joy, putting together Stray Kids and leading the group. I love how funny and chaotic they are and it hurts me to see how underrated they are in Korea overall. We can always appreciate some chaotic Aussie humor.kinky felix low voice stan (but his high voice is extremely stable too and i luv but felix is mostly my bias because HIS LOW VOICE fsodifjaofpsdoifjopj)Itzy - Their debut and every song leading up to it has been bops, and their dances are very strong. I think most of us can agree that Yeji (also Bang Chan), with amazing dance and singing skills. All of the girls showed extremely good dance skills while competing, definitely showing why they got picked.My bias is Lia because I\u2019ve always been jealous of how flexible and pretty she is. As a person who enjoys dancing and watching choreography videos, her dance for the competition blew me away.Twice - Sometimes I really feel like they are queens of Kpop, dominating it since debut. Even though their choreography was a simpler back then, they\u2019ve really stepped it up, and every girl is a strong dancer and have always been strong vocalists. They, in my opinion, started the trend for being cutesy and girly to be ok, especially because they are from the Top 3.My bias is Nayeon because she\u2019s such a bright, bubbly person who seems like would be very loyal and sweet, or Momo, because she\u2019s such a good dancer and visual. (pINk lAmBOrghiNi)Red Velvet - I honestly thought they would be 3 on my list, but guess I was wrong. They were one of the first artists I listened to after BTS, along with iKon (who never really made it onto my list) and BLACKPINK. They\u2019re really talented girls with excellent vocals and very catchy songs. Irene is it-girl of Korea and anyone can try to convince me.My bias is Irene or Seulgi because they\u2019re talented girls and very pwety.BLACKPINK - I know most people believe BP are an untalented group with a toxic fandom, but like any not all of their fandom is toxic (but as an ARMY, I have seen a lot of the toxic side), and the real reason they\u2019re untalented is because YG Entertainment is a horrible company that just uses BP\u2019s fame for money. When YG is in need of botching up a scandal, BP has a new song ready to be released. They don\u2019t get many comebacks, but individual, they share many talents like Jisoo\u2019s singing voice and Lisa\u2019s dancing skills.My bias is Jisoo or Jennie, because Jisoo is a powerful vocal and (in my opinion) the only girl whose vocals are not held down by YG because she, by nature, has a soft, sing-song voice. And Jennie is a meme and another it-girl of Korea.NCT - Even though I don\u2019t fully \u201cstan\u201d them (I\u2019m in the process of learning names and albums and stuff), they\u2019re a really good group and interesting in the way that they add new members and have a rotating sort of concept. My favorite subunit would probably be WayV or NCT127.My bias is probably Mark or Johnny because 1) I don\u2019t know very much else about everyone else and 2) because, because.Day6 - They have really good songs, including Sweet Chaos and I mention that song because I literally CANNOT on SuperStar JYP just alkdsfj;aoejwrojeapoidv. Just like NCT, I\u2019m learning the members and songs and stuff.I don\u2019t really know most of the members but I know YoungK and that\u2019s it.Got7 - I\u2019ve known them since I started watching KPop, I just never really looked into the group (I watched a lot more Stray Kids) but they have an interesting discography I can deal with and yeeea.My bias is Jackson because (ahem) MAMA meeeme and also because just,\u2026 because.Ateez - I also never really got into the group but I\u2019ve heard of them a lot, and I really liked the concept in Wave. IMO, HALA HALA was kinda dark and the MV was not what I thought the theme would be (I listened to the song before watching the MV), but the song is rlly gewd and Wonderland was a great comeback.I don\u2019t have a bias but my friend (whose bias is Seonghwa) says I would bias Mingi because he has a low voice and apparently I have a low voice pattern in my biases. (Taehyung, Felix.. yea that\u2019s it.)",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on your taste. I\u2019ll put the ones that I think are best in each category and my recommended down. Note: I won\u2019t be including the legendary ones in here as you\u2019ve probably already heard of them Vocals: Boy groups: EXO Girl groups: Mamamoo Dance: Boy groups: Seventeen and Monsta X Girl groups: Gfriend and Dreamcatcher Groups that have debuted not for a long time, but I think have the potential to be really big: Boy groups:Stray kids (Rap is seriously amazing. Vocals are too, but I like rap more so I\u2019m kinda biased on this) Girl groups: (G)-Idle (If their agency,Cube, doesn\u2019t screw them up. I really hope not.) Fandoms: (as in peaceful ones) I am not sure about this one, but to me it feels like Seventeen, Mamamoo and Gfriend are pretty peaceful. Most ARMYs(fans of BTS) are actually pretty peaceful, but some immature fans keep ruining the name for others. I know this for a fact as I myself am an ARMY, and I have met a lot of other ARMYs just want to end the fanwars and enjoy music together. Same for Blinks. I would recommend BTS\u2019s music for their meaning lyrics and sound, but seriously, for your own good, STAY AWAY FROM THE FANDOM. If you post anything that sounds even a little bit negative about them, you would get bombarded with replies. My recommendations: Duo: AKMU, Bol4 and KHAN Co-ed group: KARD Band: Day6 and The Rose (I only know these two bands, but I really like their music) Girl groups(excluding the ones mentioned above): Red Velvet,Loona and Gugudan Boy groups: iKon,Pentagon and Got7 P.S. I don\u2019t know much about soloists, but I heard several songs that I like which are from Hyuna, Sunmi, IU, Suran and Chungha. I don\u2019t know about Jessi\u2019s music, but from the videos I watched, she is a really great and badass woman. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a lot of favorite kpop groups. Some of them are: BTS - because of their music, personalities, just the fact that they never dissapoint me and motivate so many people. Also I love their remake of Come back home. NCT - Empathy is my favorite album in year 2018, I love each one of them a lot and I like their choreographies the most. Also Taeyong is probably my no.1 idol - because of voice, performance, his dance moves etc. Stray kids - their lyrics, themes. Voices, Insomnia, 3rd eye, Question, Rock, Glow, Grow up,\u2026 whatever, also 3racha songs like Broken compass, Double knot, If, Domestic banana, Wow, many more. And they are really funny +bunch of potential. Got7 - personalities, their whole \u201cchill aura\u201d. Their fandom is nice, it\u2019s much better to stan Got7 than for example BTS. I am tired of new ARMYs, when I am on Ahgases\u2019 side of the internet, life is peaceful lol. EXO - as singers and some of them dancers, their skills are amazing. For me they were like \u201cface of the k-pop\u201d for four years. Shinee - songs, vocals. Jonghyun\u2019s album Poet is something I listen to really a lot. Noir - to me it seems like this group is full of unlucky people with amazing skills. Can\u2019t wait for their comeback - soon. That airplane choreography got me. *EDIT* They just released that song, it\u2019s better than I expexted. Check them out they debuted just moths ago but every one of their songs is nice.  BAP - just the fact that their debut was better than BTS\u2019. They were my first kpop group, Zelo and Yongguk are people that I admire a lot and I wish to hear more of their music. EDIT**** ONEUS - Just had their debut and I am totally in love with every member. I really like their voices, there are many surprising parts in this song and it somehow looks like they might try to have some story behind it.  ATEEZ - they are going to debut soon. Might become best dancers in kpop and their performance of one song just got me. Just 1:00 and wait for the chorus. **EDIT - They had their debut, definitely amazing rookies.  There are many more tho. Can\u2019t pick one they are all nice. ",

BTS (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) Undoubtely the most successful K-pop band ever, the milestones they have achieved is remarkable and praiseworthy for pushing K-pop to mainstream across the US and the Europe. The group is a celebrity-magnet, having a very large number of celebrity fans, including Shawn Mendes, Justin Bieber, Halsey, Steve Aoki, Jimmy Fallon, James Corden and John Cena. The group is highly praised for it\u2019s impact-making lyrics, that influence the lives of the millions across the world, making them more than just merely \u2018idol singers\u2019. The performance is absolutely top-notch, as they\u2019re well-known for pushing to their farthest in every performance. The record-breaking K-pop group aren\u2019t only just \u2018idol singers\u2019, but the current \u2018worldwide sensations.\u2019  Seventeen (\uc138\ube10\ud2f4) Debuting in 2015, the thirteen-member group is well-known for their absolute eye-catching dance demonstrations. Seventeen, seemingly popular among teens, for their charming personalities and young-dynamic performers, have started to enjoy initially greater success, both nationally and internationally.  SHINee (\uc0e4\uc774\ub2c8) It\u2019s undeniable that SHINee is one of the most iconic K-pop groups ever existed, their music is, simply, the best. For instance, the debut song, Replay, I\u2019ve never heard a debut song that good. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve only recently developed an interest in Kpop. After years of avoidance, I finally decided to check it out. My current obsession is Dreamcatcher.  They\u2019re the one group I can\u2019t get enough of when it comes to songs, dancing, concepts, music videos, everything. Their entire discography has been nothing but consistently high quality music. As someone more into the rock genre, it makes sense that Dreamcatcher became my first love with that rock/metal influence in their music. Since their debut in 2017, these girls have rocked the \u2018nightmare\u2019 concept with stunning visuals, dance and vocals. After their lack of success as cutesy girl group, Minx, 2017 gave them a clean slate and two additional members. Dreamcatcher\u2019s debut album, Nightmare, starts strong with addictive high energy and synchronised dancing in title track, Chase Me.  Deja Vu is, perhaps, one of my favourite music videos of all time. It\u2019s like some sort of epic fantasy story. I can\u2019t express how much I love this frame alone.  Dami\u2019s \u2018magic trick\u2019 in You and I\u2026 The entire choreography for that song is art.  And Piri\u2019s opening sequence is just beautiful.  Last year, Dreamcatcher released their album, End of the Nightmare, and they\u2019re now onto newer things, with a Dystopia series. This year, two mini albums have been released\u2014Tree of Language and Lose Myself. It\u2019s great to see that their title tracks, Scream and Boca have been doing really well.  They also have some fantastic b-sides that depart from their usual style, including: Jazz Bar, Black or White, And There Was No One Left, Polaris and Wonderland. I would highly recommend watching the group\u2019s self-made music video for Sahara. It\u2019s very professional, of course.  Can\u2019t wait to see what else Dreamcatcher has in store. c: ",

            "answer_text": "My Number one Big Bang What set Bigbang apart is 1. G- Dragon, this man is a musical genius and I think through his leadership and songwriting has made this group what it is today. 2. They have a lot of control now on their music, artist development and show production. G-dragon and T.O.P have been heavily involved in the songwriting process of Big Bangs music since the beginning, so their sound has come off consistent and more authentic as it\u2019s coming from the artist. 3. They have really great and funny personalities. I love watching Big Bang on variety shows they all have distinct personalities and a little quirky. They look like they really enjoy each others company and love what their doing. I think a group that is in a similar situation a lot earlier ( in terms of creative control and showing their real personality) is BTS. Their involvement in songwriting and presentation adds an authenticity to their full package and probably why they have a strong international following ( we want our artists to be authentic and we connect with them through their music so want it to be their story). They're not on this list because I like only a few songs less than the ones on the list, but great group <3. I would just like to note that Kwon Ji Yong by G-Dragon to me is the best K-pop album I still listen to once a month.  Apart from Big Bang I\u2019m pretty much a multi-stan, I just listen to music I like. The below is based on the groups whose tracks music I listen to the most and listen to often. EXO I tend to like upbeat songs ( rather than slow ones) and EXO has a lot of great songs ( Power, Monster, Growl). Also, they have some great vocalist esp in EXO-CBX loved Blooming Day.  TWICE I really tried not to like this group, because the cutesy girly pop music isn\u2019t really my thing but TT and What is Love is my jam.  Honourable mentions - I think these two groups will hit big A.C.E  Pentagon - I hope they can survive the scandal  ",

            "answer_text": "!The following order has no relation to my preference! Stray Kids - I can write a whole essay on them. They have 9 members who can do literally everything - they have no \u201cdance black hole\u201d, they can all sing, rap, and compose (some are better than others), which is very rare in the industry in my opinion, and I admire it a lot. Not to mention their rapper line (3RACHA) is very, very skilled. Moreover, all of their songs have relatable lyrics - some examples include growing up, insomnia, rebelling against norms.BTS - Honestly, not so much now, because their title tracks sound more generic than before and I am not a big fan of their kind of EDM (e.g. Euphoria, Magic Shop, Best of Me), but some of their songs and their older songs are still awesome in my opinion - examples include Dionysus, Dead Leaves, I'm Fine, Spring Day (THE QUEEN) and Run. Of course, I also appreciate their messages to people. And again, their rapper line is awesome.Dream Catcher - The only girl group in my list! I LOVE their dark, creepy, rock concept. Their dance is probably the most powerful and one of the hardest within existing GGs, ans I love it. While their rock songs are epic, their ballads are also soothing but not boring to listen to.Seventeen - Probably the best knife choreography group, and their dances are also creative too. In contrast to BTS, I love their type of EDM (sans DWC but I love DWC for another reason), like Home and Oh My, while their funky songs are also cute and addicting. They also have my favourite kind of voices, with DK so far the only one whose high notes give me chills.The Boyz - LISTEN this group is so underrated. Although less so than Stray Kids, they are also very multi-talented, have some of the best visuals and voices in my opinion, and their knife choreo is also no joke. Their songs are also nice to listen to.One more thing, these five groups are also hiarious and full of walking memes, which is a bonus. ",

Most people won\u2019t give BTS a chance because they\u2019re korean and (No offense to BTS or ARMY) they look like Ken/barbie dolls. That\u2019s what people think. Oh yeah and when they see them, they immediately say \u201cEw they\u2019re gay.\u201d Just because they dress up and wear makeup, which is NORMAL in the Kpop world, and that\u2019s what people fail to realize. Anyway\u2026..My absolute favorite band is BTS because they taught me a lot of important things, and they helped me through dark times, especially when I was in a severe state of depression. I\u2019m self conscious and hate the way I look. I\u2019m not saying I change for BTS, but BTS technically are the ones that made me think more positive about myself and I have to thank them because without them, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. I really wish people would see their message behind their songs because it can help a lot of people, especially when it\u2019s illegal in North Korea. Not to be mean, but BTS are really pushing the boundaries that most koreans don\u2019t want. Like for example, some koreans, (Mostly in North) don\u2019t like it when you try to make people individual. In North Korea, they\u2019re taught to behave a certain way and taught how to act a certain way. Basically they\u2019re like puppets that are being pulled by strings. BTS, if they were to go to North Korea and do what they do now, they would be executed right there on the spot, because BTS are all about voicing your opinion and loving yourself. In short, I truly have to thank BTS for getting me out of my slump, and i\u2019ve never been happier. I LOVE the messages that they put in their music and I wish people would feel the same instead of judging them just because they\u2019re not like us. :( SORRY FOR RANTING ",

Their music is so eye catching and you cannot not fall in love with at least one of their songs. They have a great variety of vocals and although lacking in rapping (Although we haven\u2019t seen a great amount of that). I know that TXT will be one of my favorites for a while. AND THEIR VISUALS ARE JUST\u2026 NO WORDS 2. Seventeen the most consistent Kpop group I started to listen to Seventeen since the release of their 6th Mini Album You Made My Dawn. I love Seventeen\u2019s songs especially Home, Don\u2019t Wanna Cry and Getting Closer. They also have one of the best visuals like Mingyu and Vernon. They have great vocals and good units. But my most favorite is how they are seperated into different units. My personal fave is the Hip Hop Unit consisting of Vernon, Mingyu, Wonwoo and S.Coups. 3.BTS The most inconsistent but the one I most loved I still love BTS DO NOT GET ME WRONG. But the fans sometimes are super annoying and I really hate some anti BTS fans/haters come along and say \u201cOh BTS SUCKSSSSS\u201d. The ARMYS are also annoying as well. But BTS have my fave vocals and my fave rap line. They are also really good when it comes to interviews or shows. BTS THE KINGS OF KPOP ",

            "answer_text": "1- BTS !  This will group will forever be my top, why? It\u2019s because they are funny, thoughtful, kind, humble, and most importantly they taught me how to love myself just the way I am. They have such calming music, with such meaningful lyrics. I don\u2019t love them because of their looks, their popularity. I love them for being them, for being 7 amazing yet dorky crackheads that never fail to put a smile on my face everyday and their amazing personalities! Not to mention, they are such adorable babies, I can\u2019t! 2- GFRIEND !  These girls are SO underrated! They really should get noticed more, they work so hard and they love their fans dearly. They treat everyone as family, in fact they are now acquired by BigHit Entertainment, which means BTS and GFRIEND are basically a family now! Both BTS and GFRIEND have been great friends, and so as their CEO\u2019s. They really should get more attention, for the hard work they put in, like practising for comebacks, recording songs, etc. I don\u2019t adore them just because of their amazing visuals and their hard work, I also adore them for being similar to BTS, I adore them for being crackheads, for being the light that shines forever in dark times and for being so humble and caring. This group will forever be my Top 2 and will also forever will be my adorable and VERY beautiful girls! They always put a smile to my face no matter what! Also, their unique and awesome personalities too, I love them for being who they are. 3- TXT  Also another group I adore. These boys are so cute, like I don\u2019t even know why or how. Like how can 5 boys be SO freakin\u2019 adorable! This group is my Top 3rd because they have such passion into, singing, dancing, and rapping. They work hard non-stop, and they make sure their fans are satisfied with their songs. Even though they\u2019re just kind of a rookie group, I still love them. These guys, are also a bunch of crackheads! All 3 groups are, they all have something in common. I watch TXT, if I need a laugh or if I\u2019m sad and I want something to cheer me up. They never fail to put a little smile on a my face! They are SO fun to watch, because each of them have different traits and personalities that make them even funnier and better! I hope this helped you get your answer! Signed off by your lovely crackhead, -Sammie xoxo    (3 Crackhead Siblings indeed. xd) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi I'm really new into K-pop and also on Quora \ud83d\ude05. However, i've listened to many famous and non famous K-pop groups\u2019 songs. I don't know all of the members of some of these, but their songs are really good and that's why they're on my list of my top 10 K-pop groups.  10. ITZY They're literally very new in K-pop, but they've already released an album & their stage presence, performance, aura and charisma are the main factors for which i admire them. Favourite songs: Wannabe; Cherry; Dalla Dalla & Selfie Cam   9. GOT7 I think i like them more because of their personalities than their songs, but i never said that their songs aren't good. Favourite songs: Not By The Moon; Just Right; Never Ever & Girls Girls Girls   8. Ateez They debuted a few years ago, but they've already gained so much success because of their awesome discography. Their newer songs are always better than the previous ones. Favourite songs: Wonderland; Hala Hala; Answer; Wave & Treasure   7. Blackpink Even though, many people could say that they're overrated, you can't deny the fact that their songs are really catchy. Their MVs and visuals make them stand out the most compared to other K-pop groups. Favourite songs: Boombayah; Whistle; Stay; As If it's Your Last & Don't Know What To Do   6. Seventeen Their synchronization is unbelievable. Their melodic voices and visuals are stunning. Favourite songs: Hit; Left & Right; My My; Very Nice; Home; Don't Wanna Cry & Clap   5. Twice This was the first K-pop girl group i listened to. They haven't got very stable voices and aren't really good performers either, but their aura is mesmering to the point to make me fall for them. Favourite songs: Feel Special; Fancy; Dance The Night Away; Likey; Knock Knock & Fanfare   4. EXO Their songs aren't really my type, but i love their personalities. They're very humble and loving. Plus, their vocal line is outstanding. Favourite songs: Tempo; Love Shot; Growl & What Is Love   3.Mamamoo Ever heard about woman empowerment in K-pop? Yes, Mamamoo is the only K-pop group who touches these kind of topics and that makes them totally unique and different from everyone else. Not to forget that their vocals and rap are unbelievably astonishing. Favourite songs: Hip; Egotistic; Gogobebe; Yes I Am; Starry Night; Mr. Ambiguous & Taller Than You   2. MONSTA X I think they're one of the most underappreciated K-pop groups of all time. Their discography is amazing. I haven't got words to describe the feeling that i have for their songs. Favourite songs: Fantasia; Follow; Shout out; Who Do You Love; Jealousy; Alligator; Beautiful; Play It Cool & Monsta Truck   1. BTS Literally every song of theirs i've listened until now is GOLD and i really mean it when i say so. Plus, their personalities are very unique and i think that, along with GOT7 and EXO, they're one of the most humble and respectful Kpop group right now. Favourite songs: I Need U; Run; Dope; Save Me; Danger; Not Today; Spring Day; DNA; Mic Drop; Blood, Sweat & Tears; Fake Love; Epiphany; Idol; Boy With Luv;On & Black Swan   That's my ranking. You don't need to agree fully with this since it's my opinion & don't need to attack me either (i'm saying this because i've seen many Kpop fans, who are very toxic and immature). Remember to enjoy each sunset for the promise of a new tomorrow and to stay safe & healthy.  See you around ~lina ",

            "answer_text": "I really like a lot of groups, but I\u2019m going to list groups that have not been listed yet (or at least, I think; I might end up repeating some): MYNAME  They debuted in 2011, and are incredibly underrated. They\u2019ve had to promote in Japan because of this, has not had their first win despite being a group of seven years, and are extremely talented. Recently, 4 of the members (as Insoo went to military training) went on the show The Uni+, however, none of them made it to the top 9 (Seyong was very close though). Their last Korean comeback was in 2015, and I painfully wait for their next promotion. They deserve so much more attention, please love them! NU\u2019EST  They debuted in 2012, and are labelmates with SEVENTEEN (whom I love just as much). 4 of them participated on the show Produce 101 Season 2 (I think Aron had an injury, so he didn\u2019t join them), in which Minhyun made it to the top 11 and is to promote with Wanna One until the end of 2018. Due to this, they\u2019ve been promoting as NU\u2019EST W (W standing for \u2018wait\u2019, as in waiting for Minhyun) and had their first win after 5 years with \u201cWhere You At\u201d. They really deserve love! F(X)  Their last song as a group was 4 Walls, which was back in 2015. Among other SM Entertainment girl groups, I feel like SM promotes f(x) the least and it makes me really sad, because I truly love them. All members are talented, so please love them! Love former member Sulli as well, as she has many haters for some reason (although she doesn\u2019t mind them at all, she\u2019s such a queen). A.C.E  I got into A.C.E after I originally posted this, so I\u2019m adding them onto this list! They\u2019re also quite underrated. I promise they\u2019re literally the most talented group I\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re all visuals too; Donghun\u2019s my bias, hahah. Jason, Donghun, and Wow were on MixNine, while Jun and Chan were the Uni+. They\u2019re a rookie group whom only debuted in May 2017, and yet they were on survival shows. Please stan them!! ONEUS  Aha, another group I stanned after I posted this! I got into them in March and they\u2019re extremely talented and well-diverse- literally, 6 vocalists, 6 dancers, 6 rappers. I love all of them so much and I saw them in November (and I\u2019m still missing them). They\u2019re all totally precious and cute, but also so charismatic on stage, so please consider being a fan of them! I don\u2019t use Quora anymore but I was willing to edit this post just for my ONEUS boys. Three of the members were on Produce 101 Season 2 (Seoho [previously known as Gunmin], Keonhee [previously romanized as Gunhee], and Hwanwoong), as well as two of the members being on MIXNINE (Seoho again, RAVN, and Leedo auditioned but didn\u2019t pass, poor boy). ONEWE  And if I\u2019m going to do ONEUS, I have to do ONEWE too. As the brother band if ONEUS, they\u2019re also equally just as talented and cute. One member is a twin of the youngest member in ONEUS (I love both of them a lot, also because they\u2019re both born my year). That same member, Dongmyeong, has also been on Produce 101, and then the whole band was on The Uni+. They\u2019re super underrated, and they\u2019re also really funny (as to when a media outlet got the members name wrong so they wrote their hands on their palm the next time they showed up for a performance). \u2014 Other groups you should stan as well: HotshotThe Eastlight (unofficially disbanded: the two brothers have left, Eunsung has enlisted, Sagang and Junwook are doing their own thing, and Woojin deleted/archived all of his posts on Instagram)KARDPentagon (I still need to get into them too)ASTROVIXX\u2014 Personally, I think all groups deserve love, as they\u2019re all very qualified with their talents and deserve more attention (unless they do something unforgivably problematic, of course).

            "answer_text": "A-HA, I love these kinds of questions! Well, there\u2019s 3 groups that I currently ult, and 2 that I still stan but doesn\u2019t keep up much. Those groups are: Stray Kids [wallpaper created by fan @/etherealstraykids, btw] *deep breath* *insert Wonder Girls lyrics* My first love story\u2026. So, apparently it was My Pace era and at that time I\u2019m still ulting [spoiler alert, so i\u2019m not telling you] and since they come from JYP I subsribed to them and received notifications of SKZ\u2019s My Pace comeback. I thought to give them a try because they\u2019re all the hype now, why not? At first listen I thought My Pace was really catchy, especially during the Nanananana part. I subconciously came to the MV everyday, and I felt like knowing them, so I dig all infos that involve Stray Kids in it. I watched a lot of variety shows and thought, \u2018crap, they\u2019re funny and really really attractive,,, who\u2019s the guy with the chubby cheeks?\u2019 I surprisingly took a lot of quizzes to get their faces and names right, it definitely took days to differentiate Seungmin and Hyunjin (lol). Anyways, after a while I became almost o b s e s s e d with Stray Kids I complain why there isn\u2019t enough merch of them (maybe because they\u2019re still rookies at the time). My bias was Jisung and it still is except that my wreckers are now my bias [Hyunjin and Chan] while my wreckers are,,, truthfully, the rest of them HJSHSJ I CAN\u2019T CHOOSE!!! Seungmin has been wrecking me constantly with his vocals, cuteness and savageness, Jeongin is such a pure babey im,,, Woojin is so goodlooking I forgot how to spell goodlooking for a second there, Changbin is a small rapper that has LOTS of potential, Minho the 4D one and most savage and Felix with his devilish voice and angel personality. Their personalities vary and I think they\u2019re EXTRA and they are a very crackhead-oriented group (JYP gimme your organic foods). I love them LOTS AND LOTS!! look at me now, coming back to the MIROH MV 3 times a day to bop to the song. Stream Miroh for good luck \u270c 2. MAMAMOO  Mamamoo are the full balanced package: MOONBYUL the main rapper can do a hIGH NOTE effortlessly, SOLAR is a cutie that has a really nice voice, HWASA with her charisma and on-stage presence and lovely WHEEIN being the elegant woman we know today. Not only that, they are really entertaining to watch because they\u2019re CRAZY! nope, they\u2019re not crackheads. They\u2019re crazies. They have godlike vocals that can send you to hell and Hwasa is so it\u2019s entertaining to watch her walk the stage like it\u2019s her personaly runway. And it\u2019s also extremely fun to watch them being petty and bicker over ice cream. anyways, stan legends 3. TWICE  Personally, I never liked TWICE before (BLACKPINK was one of my stan lists previously?) and yep, this is the group that made me turn on notifications for JYP Ent. I thought that they were weak on vocals (but can still sing nonetheless) and are cringey, but over time I think BLACKPINK are below TWICE (not in any way I\u2019m hating on Blackpink, I\u2019m just saying Twice improved a lot before Blackpink could). Son Chaeyoung is a smol rapper that has a real nice voice (HONESTLY JYP GIVE HER MORE VOCAL LINES) , Hirai Momo is a great dancer that over time, her stamina and skills improved, Minatozaki Sana, a natural aegyoist (CHEESE KIMBAP) and also a great singer, Chou Tzuyu, visual maknae that has lots of potential and apparently one of the most stable singers in TWICE, Park Jihyo, best leader and best vocalist, Im Nayeon, bunny singer with an also natural aegyo and tomboy qualities a bit, Jeon Jeongyeon, the girl-crush vocalist, Myoui Mina, a black swan that has a soothing voice and pure visuals, and last but not least Kim Dahyun the funniest, craziest, 100-eyed girl of TWICE with well-balanced skills. Phew, that took my time. I love these girls a lot because they are really entertaining and has a very natural aegyo (unlike a few groups that are fakeys). TWICE deserves a lot after all the hate they got for that one cheer up MR removed (tbh I had no interest in them at first, no because of this shit). Stan improvement queens that doesn\u2019t lipsync during one of the Yes or Yes stage. [honorable mentions] BTS! They first bought me to KPop and I think if I hadn\u2019t met BTS I would never find SKZ. Thanks, BTS! Got7~ They\u2019re really nice, and like just like twice and skz they eat organic food! I stanned for only a short while tho. Sorry Got7, but then again I would\u2019nt ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t stan very many groups, but here\u2019s a rough list: BTS I\u2019ve just got to say\u2014when I first found BTS, I knew there was something different about them. Being able to rise from a tiny, near-bankrupt company to the top of the industry takes talent, and of course, loads of blood, sweat, and tears. They have worked so hard and I also just really love their music. Each track on each album has a memorable chorus and interesting variations, not to mention their meaningful lyrics and the fact that they write all of their own songs. Another thing that I really love about them is that when you are watching an interview, or an episode of RUN BTS, you can really never get bored, and they seem to truly have really interesting and different personalities. Times are really hard right now and I think this is having an effect on them but I hope they can cheer up (\ud798\ub0b4~)! I was actually supposed to see them on their MOTS:7 tour and will hopefully soon! 2. IU  I know, i know, she is not a group, but I just wanted to add her to this list because I think IU (Lee Ji-eun) is absolutely amazing. She has a beautiful voice, and so many amazing songs! I mean, even as a hardcore ARMY, I seriously considered putting her in here first! She is also a beautiful and wonderful actress, starring in Hotel Del Luna, Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo, Persona, etc. Her live vocals are amazing and she just looks like a total doll \ud83d\ude42 3. TWICE  My favorite girl group is definitely TWICE. I mean, it pretty much goes without saying\u2014amazing visuals, catchy songs, and just\u2026 everything! 4. Mamamoo  I mean, there\u2019s not much to say. These four women are so strong and powerful, I love their music, and I just really look up to them a lot. 5. TOMORROW BY TOGETHER (TXT)  Ok, as an ARMY, I really am Big Hit-biased, but I\u2019ve got to say, these boys amaze me! After debuting only a little more than a year ago, they already have three albums and I see the same thing as what I see in BTS\u2014not a SINGLE non-memorable track on each album. I believe that they will follow in their sunbae\u2019s footsteps and are headed to becoming world stars! 6. Seventeen  Again, I may be just a liiiiiiitle bit Big Hit-biased, but I really love Seventeen as well! 7. Ateez  I haven\u2019t, in my opinion, listened to enough of their songs to form a strong opinion, but I really loved every track their album Treasure Ep.3: One To All. I\u2019ll keep an eye on this group! 8. ITZY  Again, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve listened to enough of their songs to form a real opinion, but I liked what I saw! The girl crush vibe was really good, and their MVs that I watched were catchy! They seemed to have great dances as well. (I may also really like Chaeryoung after watching Sixteen and hating it when she was eliminated\u2026) Definitely keeping an eye on this semi-rookie group! 9. EXO  As a hardcore ARMY, I know there was a lot of beef between ARMYs and Exo-Ls, but I hope we can all come past that together and stop fandom wars :) Also, I really like Baekhyun after he was in Moon Lovers with IU \u2764\ufe0f 10. Stray Kids or NCT 127   I\u2019m technically cheating and adding another slot here, but I really couldn\u2019t choose between the two. They both have some songs that I like but I don\u2019t really stan them (Except NCT Mark, he\u2019s great). FINAL COMMENT: I know there were some groups that people will probably be surprised not to see in here\u2014Blackpink, Red Velvet, Gfriend, AOA, maybe even some of the older groups. I don\u2019t really listen to the older music like first or second gen, and I haven\u2019t really listened enough to RV, GF, or AOA\u2019s songs enough to make any opinion at all. Blackpink I probably would stan, if they had more than 12 and more different-sounding songs, and if the fandom was not so toxic. Anyway, that\u2019s all~ Thanks if you read this far!~zAyNa ",

            "answer_text": "My ultimate groups that I'm proud to say that I never went through a \u201cit took me a while but I finally like their music\u201d phase are EXO, RedVelvet, Twice and NCT. For other groups I really had to get myself to like them:( So here's reasons why these are my four fave groups. TWICE  I casually listened to TT by Twice some time ago. I never got to even finish the song for some reason, so I just forgot TWICE existed for months. That was until Fancy! I stumbled across it by accident and realized oh these are those girls! Everything in the video gave me goosebumps from the beginning, but the cherry on top was Dahyun! I love them and I think they're really talented and very beautiful! I don't know a single twice song I dislike:) NCT  I really don't care how many they are, if you know a group with so much talent packed into it, then why aren't you stanning? Lol I'm just kidding. Honestly NCT is almost untouchable when it comes to talent, though I think they need a few more vocalists. It actually didn't take me as long as it took other groups to learn their faces and names. All of their sub units are lit af too! Can we also talk about their visuals too? They all look amazing, that's all I can say:) Edit: okay so I'm eating my words after saying they need more vocalists because even their rappers have mind blowing voices! Damn! RedVelvet  I think RedVelvet are the best female kpop vocalists of this third generation! They kill both red and velvet sides perfectly! I started to Stan during Sappy era, and let's just say they blew my hat off with their voices and visuals! They're all very beautiful, and their fandom is so unproblematic! EXO  I have to admit after discovering EXO through Loveshot, I immediately liked them. I had a bunch of their songs on my phone I'd listen to for months, but I wasn't seeing their faces so I didn't even know I supported any group called \u201cEXO\u201d. It was until I decided to watch an MV of them that I was shook! I'm just gonna say they all look like freaking gods! And their voices are amazing as well! I really respect a group where even the rappers can sing amazingly good:) Edit: understatement these men are gods! I'm smitten   Other groups I immediately loved without needing to get used to them are; GOT7MamamooMomolandMonstaX etcThe list goes on, but these are on the top of my list:) thanks for reading Quora's best friend ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite K-pop band ever - 2NE1 I just discovered them recently after becoming an ARMY. Sadly they already disbanded. But Dara, CL, Bom and Minzy are forever in my heart, every single of their song is so beautiful, amazing and relatable. Forever a Blackjack. Wow, I just love everything about them. And I think there would never be another girl group. ever, could replace their space in my heart. Forever my queens.  You may have watched concept of many K-pop girl group: thin, tall, cute with similar face and choreography dance. But 2NE1 is a hundred percent different. They can put on the most craziest outfit that you could never think people can wear but still look so cool. They can have the most weirdest hairstyle that you never could imagine but still look amazing. They were considered \u201cugly\u201d compared to the Korean beauty standard when they debuted but they have conquered the most difficult audience and made history and even they made a song called UGLY. Their music - all in Korean - yet you can just watch them sing and could understand feel the pain, the joy, the happiness, the story and all the emotion they put in their songs. I don\u2019t have my 2NE1\u2019s favorite song cause I love every single piece of their music. It is like - whatever they released a new song, it has to be great. Their live performance - they do not need choreography dances like others but they put each of their stage presence ON FIRE. You can watch the last performance before the fatal date in here . Their power, their confidence and their energy, there are no words that could express. I do not have my bias in the group because I just like all of them. The four girls are totally different but they harmonize so well under the name 2NE1. DARA Visual of the group. Perhaps because she is the most beautiful member of the group or perhaps she is in a group full of talents that she has always been considered incompetent. People say she cannot sing or dance well. Yet she has overcome all critics and proves them all wrong.  MINZY Being considered the least beautiful member, she is the typical sample of how \u201cTALENT BEATS APPEARANCE\u201d. She was chosen by the YG\u2019s CEO to be a trainee since she was just 12. She does not have to be show off any part of her body cause she is already so attractive with her voice, her dance moves and her stage presence.  BOM She can be cute and sexy at the time. She can do some very sexy dance moves and still looks so cute. And her voice is like an angel. She had been into a big scandal in her career and I really hope she could come back and give us more amazing music  CL The greatest leader, the greatest rapper and the most badass singer I have ever know. Every time I see her perform, she is just so powerful, energetic and charming and so caring to all of her sisters.  I just have a simple wish that one day, they can reunite and again put the stage on fire. Forever a Blackjack!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I feel that BTS is an obvious choice (don't get me wrong, I love them) but here are some others. (all boy groups, since I don't really stan any girl groups.) -Stray Kids. Fandom: STAY. Most recent song? Astronaut. Songs I recommend? I Am You, Miroh, Maze of Memories, Hellevator. I would say they have a nice mix of upbeat and serious songs, but they are more upbeat than not, at least in some aspect. -NCT. Fandom: NCTzens. There are three sub-units, so I'll give one song recommendation for each. NCT U: Boss. This got me into NCT. NCT 127: Chain. NCT Dream: Boom. The first song I liked by the Dreamies. I would definitely say that their songs are pretty upbeat. -ATEEZ. Fandom: ATINYs. Most recent song? Wonderland. Songs I recommend? Say My Name, Wave, Treasure, Hala Hala. I would say that they are more often upbeat than not. -AB6IX. Fandom Name: ABNEW. Most recent song? Blind For Love. Songs I recommend? Breathe, Dandelion, Blind For Love, Pretty. I would say that their songs give off more of a \"soft\" vibe, still upbeat but maybe slower, or have more serious aspects. -VICTON. Fandom Name: Alice. Most recent song? I am a new fan, and Nostalgic Night is the most recent MV, so I'm assuming that's it. Songs I recommend? New World, Farewell, Nostalgic Night, Here I Am. From what I've heard, I would say they are a bit like Stray Kids in how often their songs are upbeat. -ONEUS. Fandom name: To Moon. Most recent song? Lit. Songs I recommend? ZigZag, English Girl, Valkyrie, Eye Contact. I would say that their songs are more like AB6IX's, soft. Lit was pretty upbeat though. -A.C.E. Fandom Name? Choice. Most recent song? Savage. Songs I recommend? Under Cover, Cactus, Mr. Bass, Savage. I would say that their songs have more of a \"rock\" aspect to them. More hardcore. -TXT. Fandom Name: MOA. Most recent song? They came out with a new album a few weeks ago, but the most recent MV is Magic Island. Songs I recommend? Blue Orangeade, Run Away, Magic Island, Our Summer. I would say that again, they have the same type of songs as AB6IX. -There are a couple other groups that I like a few songs by, but I wouldn't necessarily consider myself a fan of them, since I don't know enough about the members or songs. Here are they and songs I like by them: -MONSTA X. Fandom: Monbebes. Songs? Follow, Dramarama. I would say that their songs sound like a mixture of rock and upbeat, like if you mashed Stray Kids and A.C.E.'s songs together. -UP10TION. Fandom: Honey10. Songs? Blue Rose, Your Gravity. Again, I haven't really listened to many of their songs, but Blue Rose seems more serious while Your Gravity is upbeat. -SEVENTEEN. Fandom: Carats. Songs? Home, Hit. Hit was pretty upbeat, but from what I've heard their songs are a little slower. (AB6IX vibes again) -Dreamcatcher. (Girl Group) Fandom: InSomnia. Songs? PIRI, Deja Vu. Definitely sounds more like rock than pop. -WINNER. Fandom: Inner Circle. Songs? SOSO, Really Really. SOSO was definitely more serious, while Really Really just makes you feel happy. -The Rose. Fandom: Black Rose. Songs? Baby and Beautiful Girl (However, Beautiful Girl is sung by only the leader and a member form another group.) Again, more of a rock aspect. \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e ",

[Lemme put a disclaimer that no one reads: Just because a group isn\u2019t mentioned in this list doesn\u2019t mean that I hate them, keep that in mind when reading my answer. Also these are in no particular order.] Twice They\u2019re really talented, their personalities don\u2019t seem too fake, they have good personalities, they have good chemistry (especially the Japanese line), they have good discography, all of them are visuals, so why shouldn\u2019t I stan them? need I say more? Red Velvet Vocals? Wendy. Visuals? Irene. Dance? Seulgi. Rap? Joy, Irene and Yeri. Hotel? Trivago. BTS They\u2019re all extremely talented and, well, I stan talented groups. NCT No, it\u2019s not hard for me to stan a group with 18 members. It really isn\u2019t. Got7 I mean-why wouldn\u2019t I stan them? they\u2019re crackheads and are high on drugs, another reason for stanning them. ITZY I love their concept and they\u2019re really good at dancing. Monsta X They\u2019re so underrated :( please check them out, they\u2019re really talented! Dreamcatcher Queens of dark concepts. EXO How can you not stan them? Mamamoo Probably one of the most talented groups out there. TXT They\u2019re still rookies but they\u2019re so talented. (G)-IDLE You\u2019re lying if you tell me that their songs aren\u2019t bops. Gfriend They have some of the best vocals in K-pop. Periodt. Everglow All I can say is, I love them. LOONA No, just because I stan Loona doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll go on saying \u2018\u2019STAN LOONA\u2019\u2019 everywhere. Trust me. KARD I love them and their discography. Plus, they seem so close with each other. Lastly, Somin\u2019s vocals are underappreciated.  Sooo those are all the groups I stan. Check these groups out if you haven\u2019t already for clear skin.

            "answer_text": "There are numerous talented kpop groups out there but here are my top 10 :) 10. Red Velvet These girls are extremely talented and have great vocals! I\u2019m always pleased with their albums (including their side tracks) and they\u2019re all in all the perfect girl group. But with that being said, I don\u2019t really see myself being involved with them more than listening to their music as I find their lives as well as variety show presence not so entertaining or energetic. Hence, justifying their place at number 10. Bias: Seulgi  9. Super Junior Okay these men are so widely loved and looked up to and it\u2019s not for no reason! They are so extremely talented, have amazing stage presence and don\u2019t even get me started on their discography. They are hilarious and they will remain iconic regardless of the number of years that pass! Bias: Heechul  8. BigBang Well\u2026.It\u2019s sad that I had to move them down the list when they really deserved to be in the top 5. There\u2019s no doubt that Seungri is cancelled but it\u2019s hard to unstan the group for that reason alone. Sure the others have been in a few scandals as well but they don\u2019t deserve what they\u2019re gonna get when they come back from the military. They\u2019re so so talented and worked so hard (especially GD) to achieve what they did and even be called as the \u201cKings of KPOP\u201d at a point of time. The opened up kpop to so many international fans and brought life to award shows and variety shows. I\u2019m disappointed at Seungri for his actions but\u2026I hope the rest still have a comeback and regain their lost place in the industry once again! Bias: Taeyang  7. Girls Generation Okay these queens are the ones who got me into kpop many years ago! Their music, visuals, performances justify their place in the hearts of the hundreds of sones all around the world. Despite their popularity, these girls are down to earth and it\u2019s such a pleasure to see them on variety shows (especially running man). Their solos are doing great and Oh GG\u2019s debut was a hit! I really hope SM promotes them more :) Bias: Taeyeon/Yoona  6. Exo The best male vocalists of kpop. End of Discussion. Their discography is once again flawless and the members are talented as hell! They\u2019ve gathered so much support despite going through their own share of hardships. Having one of the largest fandoms in the world, I truly believe that it\u2019s the fans that keep them going! I hope SM stops sleeping on their promotions and give us a comeback really soon! Bias: Baekhyun  5. BlackPink First of all, their comeback was a huge success! Kill this love is a bop and the girls are making it big this year! I love that they produce the kind of music that\u2019s forever iconic you know? They\u2019re definitely the type of group I see myself stanning but I feel it\u2019s the lack of representation and songs that\u2019s preventing me from getting in too deep. Anyways it\u2019s great to see that people are still supporting them and that they\u2019re getting love from both Korean as well as international fans despite all the hate that they\u2019re receiving. Let\u2019s hope that we have another comeback this year! Bias: Ros\u00e9  4. Mamamoo I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019ve always appreciated their music but I\u2019ve only recently been very into them and the fact that they\u2019ve made it up so high on the list in a short period of time says something. They are the most talented girl group in kpop. I said it. They have amazing vocals and are well equipped in all fields of entertainment. They are so so down to earth and are hilarious! They don\u2019t mind being themselves and that makes them so unique and different from other groups which makes me love them even more! Ofcourse they\u2019ve had the blackface incident but they weren\u2019t aware and even apologised for their actions so it\u2019s about time ppl stop holding that against them! Their music never disappoints and I hope they get more recognition in the future! Bias: Moonbyul/Wheein  3. Seventeen They have the best music in kpop. Period. Despite having so many members, each of them shine in their own way and I Guess that\u2019s what makes them so special. Their choreographies are the best and their live performances are absolutely worth watching! Their fandom is such a beautiful community and don\u2019t even get me started on their lightstick haha. They are hilarious and I love how they portray themselves on tv. Their concepts and units are refreshing. Good to Me is the best song I\u2019ve heard in 2019 and I can\u2019t wait for further releases. Bias: DK/Wonwoo/Mingyu/Woozi  2. Stray Kids When people may say that they became popular too fast and find that as a reason to hate on them, I really don\u2019t think so. They became popular for a reason, and that reason is called talent. They produce amazing music and gained popularity on their own and not just due to the Big 3 advantage. It\u2019s cute to see them grow on variety shows and it\u2019s safe to say that these boys are lovable. They really have one of the best and welcoming fandoms and I can\u2019t wait to see more of their content in the future..haven\u2019t been with them from the beginning but will definitely stay till the end :) Bias: Felix/Bang Chan/Hyunjin  1.BTS Okay I\u2019m going to try to make this as short as possible and cut down on the fangirling. These boys are just so special in everything that they do. They\u2019ve helped me go through so much and continue to put a smile on my face every single day. No, they aren\u2019t overrated. They deserve everything that they get and so much more after all that they\u2019ve been through. The message that they carry and whole BTS universe phenomena with the notes and webtoons are so unique! Their music is undoubtedly amazing and carry so much emotion through the lyrics! The boys work so hard to serve their fans and their loyalty and passion is what makes me want to support them for as Long as it takes! Sure the fandom contains toxicity but so does every other fandom. It\u2019s just more prevelant in larger ones and it\u2019s not a reason to hate on the boys themselves. They don\u2019t only act as a source of happiness but also bring out happiness from within each of their fans! Bias: Jungkook (but what even is a bias)  Thank You for reading if you\u2019ve made it this far! ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no groups that you SHOULD stan obviously but there are some groups that I like and I am going to name all of them :) I\u2019ll start with boy groups first. -BTS Yes if you heard too much stuff about them sry BUT they are such a wonderful group! They are internationally famous and their songs are so good! They are currently on a world tour right now so you might not hear new music until like real late this year or maybe beginning of next year (idk). But keep listening to the other songs! Some of my favorites are Not TodaySpring DayBlood, Sweat, and Tearsand the recent ones DNA (very poppy and colorful ; like a pt1 to IDOL kinda)FakeLove (very dark concept and really deep)Anpanman (peppy childish and cute)Idol (I love IDOL a lottt)These are some of the songs that I named but there are many many MANY songs out there and they are all a bop :) -Pentagon I recently got into them but WOW. They are such a fun group ! They make/sing songs that makes you excited and happy yet on the other hand, other make you want to cry because the vocal line is so good! Some songs I recommend are Shine (I would listen to this first)Runaway (AHHH SOOOO GOOD!!)Beautiful (This makes me want to cry. LITERALLY)Some of my recent favorites are Naughty boy (Super super cute!!!)Just do it yo! (This one has the same vibe as Beautiful and lemme tell you Hui\u2019s opening vocal and Shinwon\u2019s part and Yuto\u2019s rap is the cause of my death)-Seventeen I heard \u201cDon\u2019t wanna cry\u201d like early 2018 and I thought that song was soooo good! Song recommendations are ThanksClapDon\u2019t wanna cry (a legend)My favorite song Oh my! (I literally listen to this song on repeat every single day.)-iKON Love Scenario was such a big hit in both SK and the west. That is how I was first introduced to them. I didn\u2019t really follow them until now but they\u2019re sooooo good!! Some song recommendations Good-bye road (newest comeback)Love ScenarioMy faves are Killing me (Like really. This is the cause of my death)Girl Groups -BLACKPINK I\u2019ve been stanning BlackPink for over a year now but they never fail to amaze me! I fell in love with them like right after AIIYL era and my first comeback with them was Ddu-Du Ddu-Du Some song recommendations are As If It\u2019s Your Last (this song is a LEGEND)Boombayah (VERY VERY impactful debut song)Ddu-Du Ddu-DuSome of my other favorite songs are Forever youngSee you later (Man I wish this song came out before I dumped my ex. It\u2019s such a badass song I love it!!! Look up the lyrics when you listening to it. )-TWICE Twice it the very first kpop girl group that I got into. They frequently have comebacks and they are all hits!! Some recommendations TTCheer up!What is Love?My faves Like a ooh-ahh (I love the dance, the song, and the mv)Sweet talker (this is in the same album as What is Love // issa side track// but its so cute!!)-FROMIS_9 I\u2019ve always knew them from like DKDK era but I never grew to like that song which I honestly don\u2019t understand why cuz DKDK is a bop. I can say that I got into them again because of Love Bomb. Soooo songs that I recommend are\u2026. Love Bomb (DUH)To heart (this song is really cute)DKDK (I think it\u2019ll depend whether or not you like it)-IZ*ONE I\u2019ve been watching Produce 48 from the very beginning and I just want to say that I love them PERIOD. Their debut song and music video was really good in my opinion and the members are all so cute T_T Songs that I recommend La Vi en Rose (SUCH A BOP I LOVE IT)We together / Beautiful Color (The two songs have similar vibes but I love them both)O my! (Hitomi and Nako are NOT my biases but they are soooo cute and they wrecked me super hard. All of the members have really good amounts of lines and its a cute song)-(G)I-DLE They are the first girl group I\u2019ve been following since debut and WOW they are doing so good. Song I recommend are\u2026. LATATA (Listen to this first, it will wow you)$Dollar$ (this is so poppy and I like it :))))Hann (This is such a cool concept and the complete opposite of LATATA and its just wow)))I tried listing as many groups as possible but there is obviously many more underrated groups like Elris and Stray Kids and yeah A LOT MORE so don\u2019t get too influenced on others to pick what groups you want to listen to :) Hope it helped.

Music, their style just fit me and I love most of their songs but my faves are. Just right , if you do , lullaby, and lots more . Their lyrics are simple to learn, I'm not Korean , so I don't really care about the meaning of the songs, I could be singing nonsense in my house but my mom would praise me for knowing Korean, so I dont care about meaning of songs except how simple the lyrics are to learn, and their lyrics were simple that I learnt them in a day . Their personalities, they are so much like my brothers , (yeah exactly like my brothers) they are extra, funny, and at least real , there is a limit to scripted performances, but this guys don't act like all what they do is scripted, they seem genuinely fun and sweet. And psycho(the good way) and let's not forget savage, The fandom is peaceful, we sure have some toxic fans , but atlease it is 0.001% of us , unlike groups with 35\u201350% toxicity Lastly they are all damn freaking visuals, my non kpop friend actually started stanning them cos of their visuals So sweetie you should Stan them, If you want 7genuine 7 sweet , 7savage ,7sassy, 7talented, 7visual, ,7crack heads , we are called ahgases I Stan other boy groups like stray kids, super junior, nct, exo, and bts , ( even tho I dislike the bts fandom I listen to their music ) My gg are twice, blackpink, red velvet, mamaoo, itzy  King of savage aka PARK JIN YOUNG aka mom  Our otter / sunshine aka CHOI YOUNGJAE  King of extra, in every good way aka I am JACKSON WANG from China   Sweetest and best leader ever our dad aka IM JAEBUM  You wanna know who dab was invented for it was this guy BAMBAM aka how do u know I'm not big   Couldnt hold my self had to upload two of this king of visuals MARK TUAN our shy boo  Our not- so-small maknae KIM YUGYEOM They bring peace to kpop ",

Big Bang, BAP, 2PM, Cross Gene (but the last clip I saw of them buying food together made me feel so sad), Block B, Day6, Winner - gosh there are so many \u2026 I also like EXO, BTS, The Rose, BVNDIT, Itzy, Oneus, NFlying, KNK, Ab6ix, MonstaX, SF9, Got7, Nu\u2019est, Kard, Vixx, Halo, Spectrum, Shinee, TVXQ, Sechskies, iKon, probably a heap of others I can\u2019t think of right now. 3YE could be interesting? A 3 girl hip hop group. I have a love hate relationship with groups like NCT but I guess I could say the same about MonstaX (I didn\u2019t like Alligator) but I loved NCT\u2019s Baby Don\u2019t Stop and Boss. Both groups come across well in interviews. I know Stray Kids are very popular and their earlier songs I quite like but not so much now. I love the Australian accents. I normally prefer female soloists over the girl groups. Red Velvet had a couple songs that I liked. I avoided Twice as I was never into the cute concepts but their last couple of songs I liked. I know it\u2019s not the question but I like, as solo artists, Zico, Taemin, Key, Park Bom, Dean, Heize, Sunmi, Dalsooobin (?), Chungha, Leegikwang. I know I am missing out at least one important group I love but I have a brain fade! I will call it quits now as this one finger typing on my phone is tiring :( ",

            "answer_text": "I love Yoonseok/Sope I know many ARMYs ship Yoonmin much more than Yoonseok, but I can\u2019t see it. Jimin is a very loving person and mostly shows it through physical actions. Many clips will show Jimin latching on to a member or just straight being touchy with them. This is mainly because in Korea they\u2019re much more touchy than people in America, so when they become more physical with another it\u2019s usually shown as a mere friendship. However, I\u2019ve seen Yoonseok encounter one another and they seem so comfortable with one another. Of course all the members are comfortable with each other since they\u2019ve been together for over six years now, but Hoseok and Yoongi seem to be close in a different way. When they\u2019re around each other they seem so balanced. Yoongi is usually grumpy and/or sleepy, and Hoseok is usually loud and/or active. They seem like opposites and would be the two members that don\u2019t get along as well as they would with the others, but this is quite false. There are times when Hoseok is doing his own thing (entertaining another member or just flat out being loud) and Yoongi would suddenly join in and vice versa. Not to mention they have known each other longer than Yoongi had known Jimin. Jimin was the last and final member to join the roster for BTS. Before he came Hoseok was originally suppose to be a vocalist, but he wanted to try rapping. He didn\u2019t know how to rap at the time, and Yoongi, with the help of Namjoon, taught him how. He soon traded places with Taehyung (who was originally suppose to be a rapper but became a vocalist) and became the third member of the rap line. Also both being rappers they tend to be closer just by their roles in the group. If you got this far thank you for reading all this. Simply search Youtube for Yoonseok and you\u2019ll see what I mean. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have an outright favorite, but I\u2019ve shown the most consistent dedication to these bands (I define \u201cconsistent dedication\u201d by saying I know a good 75\u201380%, if not all of their songs, I\u2019m subscribed to their main channels, watch music videos and shows within a week of release, and know at least a decent bit of trivia concerning the members): BTS - After stumbling across their music video of Blood, Sweat, and Tears, I bought the entire Wings album, no regrets. It was the first K-Pop album I bought. Fast forward a few weeks of scanning YouTube for more performances, interviews, and funny moments, I committed to purchasing their other main tracks (honestly, thank goodness for Spotify, it saved my bank account) and accepted the fact that I had fallen into the ARMY trap. I was immediately drawn to Taehyung and Jimin, but ultimately I think each member is individually and uniquely talented, I adore their teasingly supportive group dynamic, and I enjoy their overarching concept (from the story behind their lyrics and range of musical style, to their light-hearted interactions in Run BTS, and their visuals overall). I\u2019m proud to call BTS my first K-pop love, and I wish them well through their upcoming seasons.  I mean, of course, I\u2019m loving the glow up, but fight me, Blood, Sweat, and Tears was their best era.  Monsta X - I accidentally clicked on a video of Kihyun singing a capella and fell hard for his pure tone. From there I started listening to some of their more popular tracks, found I really enjoyed their edgier vibe and strong beats. I admired their stage presence, technically challenging dances, and after watching the addictively entertaining Monsta X-Ray, I couldn\u2019t help but stan these hard-working, brilliant, hilarious members. I\u2019ll admit, I don\u2019t really want to go to a BTS concert (too many screaming fans makes me claustrophobic, and too expensive), but after hearing that Monsta X is coming to the USA, I low-key high-key really hope to score a ticket. They deserve more recognition\u2026I\u2019m so glad that their newest releases have been trending!  Mamamoo - I was initially more into boy groups than girl groups, as I tend to shy away from more cute concepts in general. Mamamoo defied my every pre-conceived expectation. They are undeniably attractive without aligning with the more stereotypical K-pop female visuals, each member has distinct vocals that are necessary to the group\u2019s harmony, and their songs tend to resonate in my head longer than almost any other group (aside from the two previously mentioned). I freely admit to having an obsession with Hwasa, but honestly, all four of these women are queens. And yes, they slay.  Other than these three groups, lately I\u2019ve been listening to a handful of tracks from these (I know more than just their title/top songs, but I\u2019m not as dedicated long-term): SHINee, Twice, Red Velvet, GOT7, Stray Kids, EXO ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s quite a few of them: BTS (Seokjin biased)  My first impression of them\u2026 Wasn\u2019t very nice. But that changed. Now, they became one of the reasons why I smile every day. They changed my perspective on life, turned me into a better person, made me happier. It\u2019s only enough to look at their picture and I\u2019ll smile like an idiot. Stanning them was definetely one of the best decisions I have ever made. Sure, I love other groups very much but no other group can compare to the connection that I share with Bangtan. I really can\u2019t explain it. I\u2019m just glad that I found them. I won\u2019t take it for granted. 2PM (Junho biased)  I regret not stanning this group earlier. I only found out about them this June and since then I couldn\u2019t get their music out of my head. It only took one look to know that they will definetely be one of my favourite groups. Seriously, their vocals and dance moves are beast. Members are also very handsome and they all share likable personalities. It\u2019s impossible not to love them. Now, they haven\u2019t been active since 2016 because of their enlistments and stuff but I\u2019m telling you, once they come back, it won\u2019t be good for your faves. Also, this is an OT7 picture with Jaebeom since my crying ass can\u2019t get over him. GOT7 (Kunpimook biased)  This group. Seriously. It\u2019s impossible not to love them. Their bond with each other just hits different. They were never a group for me bout a family. Stanning them really feels like that. Like you\u2019re a part of a big happy family. We may have some ups and downs but we\u2019ll always find a way to be happy at the end of the day. The boys have always been questioned if their voices, performances and music in general were worth it but trust me, they are. The passion and hard work they put into music is out of this world. Kpop found a wrong group to understimate. If anyone deserves more respect and attention, it\u2019s definetely GOT7. Blackpink (Chaeyoung biased)  Hate or disagree with me as much as you want, I don\u2019t care. Hear me up first. Trust me, the girls didn\u2019t train over 4\u20135 years to be treated like this by their company and be disliked by most of the Kpop community. They always get called out for their inactivity but that\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s their company\u2019s fault for not treating them the way they deserve. When it comes to Blackpink, people would always focus on the bad things. They may have only 10+ songs but it sure was more then enough for me to acknowledge the talent the girls have in themselves. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll awalys support them and hope for their situation to get better. But if you look at it this way, they only needed less then 20 songs to became world\u2019s most popular female Kpop group so yeah\u2026 They INDEED are talented. Sips tea. TXT (Beomgyu biased)  Okay. They are my babies. I agree that I may have started stanning them because they are BTS\u2019 junior group but they justified that title soon after that and now they\u2019re one of my favourite Kpop groups ever. Do you even see how Yeonjun looks in this picture, oh my God. Okay, I\u2019ll shut up now and continue. See, their talent can\u2019t be handled, literally the whole group raps, sings and dances well. They fit into every possible concept they tried so far. I feel like they may be mistreated by Kpop community because they\u2019re BTS\u2019 juniors, but trust me, they\u2019re more than that and one day they will prove it to you all. They definetely deserved the title of Rookies Of The Year. This is just the beggining for the boys and I can\u2019t wait to continue this journey with them till the end. Mamamoo (Wheein biased)  I\u2019ve been stanning them since forever. Back in the days where Kpop wasn\u2019t my first choice of music, these girls have always been my number 1 girl group. They\u2019re talented, of course, but their personalities are also golden and something that made me fall in love with them in the first place. They\u2019re making a change by fighting against stereotypes in Korea and they\u2019re putting up a good picture for younger girls who look up to them. They totally should. Also, members aren\u2019t even fluent English speakers but they\u2019re still making a name for themselves in Western countries. I\u2019m not even surprised, their harmony and talents shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed or unappreciated. Honorable mentions: Stray Kids (Jeongin biased) iKON (Jinhwan biased) (I lost my Kpop virginity with this group lol. They may not be one of my ultimate groups but I will forever respect them and be thankful for showing me this beautiful place called Kpop) EXO (Baekhyun biased) Shinee (Jonghyun biased, sleep well angel\u2665) Seventeen (Jihoon biased) NCT (Mark biased) NCT Dream (Jaemin biased) NCT 127 (Yoonoh biased) NCT U (Taeyong biased) WayV (Dejun biased) (I\u2019m an NCT trash I know) GFriend (Sojung biased) Oneus (Hwanwoong biased) SuperM (Taemin biased) B1A4 (Junghwan biased) Twice (Dahyun biased) Everglow (Eunji biased) Pentagon (Hongseok biased) Momoland (Joowon biased) ",

            "answer_text": "The Top 10 K-Pop Entertainment Companies in 2019 K-pop is still bigger than ever. It is growing every day not just in Asia but all around the world. Furthermore, K-pop Entertainment companies are reporting all-time high profits and pop groups are getting global exposure. Recently BTS performed on SNL which made them the first Korean musical performer on the show. Therefore, Korea\u2019s main asset still continues to be K-Pop as K-Pop entertainment companies continue to find new talent. Most of these K-Pop companies/agenciesare looking to expand outside of Korea and into other Asian markets as well as the United States. People all over the world want K-Pop more than ever. K-pop is a blend of electronic, hip-hop, pop, rock, R&B, and even rap. Currently, K-pop is a $5 billion global industry. The Battle for the Top Spot Most of the Korean Entertainment companies are listed on KOSDAQ (SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, FNC Entertainment, and CUBE Entertainment). Both SM and YG Entertainment have been the two most dominant over the last decade. However, with all the K-pop scandals that YG faced in 2018, JYP and SM are now battling it out for the top spot. For this ranking we at Seoulz took into account three factors: Talent rosterMarket CapitalizationFuture PotentialThis is our comprehensive list of the Best K-Pop Entertainment Companies in 2019 1.Big Hit Entertainment  The success of Big Hit Entertainment is because of ONE group and one group only\u2026BTS. In addition, BTS has been having one of the most successful runs of all time. Big Hit was just a small company and in 2007 they were on the brink of bankruptcy. But with BTS they were able to create one of the biggest boy groups of all time. BTS is a 7 member boy band and they have already sold millions of albums and their YouTube videos are some of the most-watched videos on Youtube. BTS was not an overnight sensation. They debuted in 2013. BTS stands for Bangtan Sonyeondan which translates to Bulletproof Boy Scouts. Now BTS stands for Beyond the Scene. A Huge Boom to the Korean Economy It is estimated that BTS added $3.8 billion to the Korean economy in 2018. This number could double in 2019. The band could generate $40 billion over the next decade for the South Korean economy. They first came to the US in 2014. The group was living in LA and learning about western culture. They even played at LA K-Con. They have since collaborated with Nicki Minaj, Halsey, and Ed Sheeran. In 2017 won billboard award for top social artists. Beating Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. In 2018 BTS partnered with UNICEF, Converse, Coca Cola, Puma, and Hyundai. Their stadium shows around the world quickly sold out. In 2019 they performed at Soldier Field and Metlife Stadium generating over $30 million in ticket sales. Their Love Yourself/Face Yourself Tour has generated over $100 million. Top Social Media K-Pop Group They are very connected to their loyal fans who are called Army. BTS used social media to make themselves available and visible. The Band had full control of their social media. They were able to show their fans what was going on backstage. BTS has only one band account. One account per platform. For example, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter. Big Hit Entertainment has over 27 million subscribers on YouTube which goes to show their potential market cap once they have their IPO. Therefore, once they do they will crush all competition. This is why Bit Hit Entertainment is #1 in our rankings. Artists: BTS, TXT, TOMORROW Estimated Market Cap: $1.5 Billion 2. SM Entertainment  They are now battling JYP for the 2nd spot. The company has focused a lot on the Chinese market in 2018. They will look to continue that in 2019. After getting investments from Alibaba and now Tencent, their popularity grew even more in China. If you check out their youtube channel they have over 19 million subscribers. Data shows that over 90% of the subscribers are not Korea. In addition, a vast majority are from China. Their strategic partnership with Tencent Music Entertainment will help SM Entertainment\u2019s distribution and marketing in the Chinese music market. SM even has a Chinese boy band called WayV. Breaking into the Chinese Market China is one of the leaders in the music streaming space. Tencent Music Entertainment has close to 900 million monthly users across four of the top music service platforms in China. To put that into context, Spotify has just under 200 million monthly active users. Through the partnership, Tencent Music Entertainment will have access to SM\u2019s entire music catalog. SM\u2019s music and video platform sales have grown close to 50% from last year. SM\u2019s yearly YouTube views have reached just under 8 billion by the end of 2018. Their top female K-pop group at the moment is Red Velvet which is doing their first solo tour in the United States. Their top male K-pop group Super Junior is doing a tour around South America. SM is planning to create an American version of Girl\u2019s Generation as well as a European version of NCT. Artists: S.E.S., Kangta, BoA, TVXQ!, CSJH, Super Junior, Girl\u2019s Generation, J-Min, EXO, Shinee, f(x), Zhou Mi, NCT, and Red Velvet. Estimated Market Cap: $970 Million 3. JYP Entertainment  JYP was founded in 1997 by J.Y. Park. The company has been known for making the careers of K-pop legends such as Wonder Girls, Rain, and Miss A just to name a few. Their YouTube channel has over 12 million subscribers. Their current hottest group TWICE has over 3.5 million followers on Twitter and Instagram combined. While the company has focused a lot on China, JYP focused a lot on Japan. TWICE broke all the records for K-pop girl groups in Japan. The loss of Suzy will hurt JYP, but what JYP does best to find talent from all around the world. They hold auditions all across Asia. Entering the Japanese Market TWICE and GOT7 will continue to focus on Japan as both are gaining a lot of popularity there. But the company will look to support their 2019 projects Mix Nine and Stray Kids. They recently formed a partnership with The Orchard in hopes of expanding their reach outside of Korea. The Orchard is a part of Sony Music Entertainment. They are in charge of global digital and physical distribution. This will help JYP enter the U.S. and European markets in 2019. Artists: 2PM, TWICE, GOT7, DAY6, 15&, Stray Kids and ITZY Estimated Market Cap: $980 Million 4. YG Entertainment  What a terrible year for YG Entertainment. Their biggest female K-pop star CL wants out of her contract. Then they are hit with the biggest sex scandal to ever hit Korea. We will get to that a little later. The K-pop entertainment companies have all suffered due to the scandal of Seungri. LVMH invested $80 into YG Entertainment and China\u2019s social media giant Tencent and its related online ticketing company Weiying Technology agreed to invest $85 million into YG Entertainment in 2016. Weiying owns 8.2% of YG and Tencent owns 4.5%. They also got a huge partnership/investment from Naver, South Korea\u2019s largest internet portal for around $90 million (9% equity stake). Their current top group is Black Pink who are traveling across Asia in early 2019. They have also partnered with Universal Music Group\u2019s representative label, Interscope. Winner will also look to start their U.S. tour in 2019. The Seungri Scandal However, the key to YG will be the comeback of Big Bang after most have now finished their military service. But is that possible with the Seungri scandal? Investors have already started to sell their shares of YG Entertainment and by the end of 2019, it is possible that Big Hit Entertainment will surpass them. Seungri is facing jail time after allegations of drug use and sexual assaults at his nightclub Burning Sun. He has already posted on Instagram that he is quitting show business. YG Entertainment has a major PR problem they need to deal with. Big Bang is a major part of YG\u2019s success. If they fail so will the company. They alone account for 40% of the companies total sales. Their strategy for 2019 will probably be to focus on Blackpink\u2019s comeback. However, Blackpink cannot replace Big Bang. This should be an interesting year. Artists: 2NE1, BIG BANG, WINNER, 1TYM, DJ Tukutz, G-Dragon, Daesung, T.O.P., Taeyang, Kang Seung-Yoon, Minzy, Dara, Psy, Sandara Park, iKon, Seungri, Sechskies, Yang Hyun-Suk, Stony Skunk, Akdong Musician, Katie Kim, Lee Hi, Epik High, Tablo, Taebin, Teddy Park, iKONG, and MOBB, and Black Pink. Estimated Market Cap: $740 Million 5. FNC Entertainment  For FNC Entertainment 2018 was terrible. 2017 was better. 2018 brought a lot of scandals with F.T. Island and AOA. The company itself seems to lack leadership and it seems to have a lot of corruption and is one of the low trending K-pop entertainment companies. In 2017 things ran much smoother. FNC started to focus more on dance. FNC has been known for cool/hipe bands like CNBLUE, SF9, and AOA who have all transitioned into more of a dance group. TV vs Music However, the biggest star for FNC Entertainment is not even a K-Pop star but the famous Yoo Jae Suk who they signed in 2017. That signing alone rose FNC\u2019s stock prices by 30% raising the company\u2019s value to close to $300 million. Therefore FNC relies more on their T.V. talent than singers. This might be a good strategy moving forward as they will not be able to compete with the Big 3 and for sure not Big Hit. Veteran actors Lee Dong Gun will continue to help FNC as they look to split their talent base down the middle. SF9 is who FNC will focus the most on in 2019. They are looking to push them in Japan as well as Latin America. Their new female group Cherry Bullet will also debut in 2019. CNBLUE\u2019s Jung Yong-hwa will leave the military in November of 2019 so a late CNBLUE comeback could be in the works. Artists: CNBLUE, FT Island, N. Flying, AOA, AOA Cream, Hong-gi, Yonghwa, Jimin, Choa, Jong-hyun, InnoVator, SF9, and Juniel. Estimated Market Cap: $120 million 6. Cube Entertainment  Cube Entertainment has found great success with their new group PENTAGON. PENTAGON looked to take the place of B2ST who left Cube Entertainment. This was an attempt to revive Cube Entertainment who has not had a great 2016 and has seen their stocks suffer continual losses even into 2017-2018. Cube\u2019s success depended on PENTAGON\u2018s and CLC\u2018s debut and HyunA\u2018s comeback. With the loss of 4 minute and B2ST, it was crucial for PENTAGON and CLC to pick up the slack which they were unable to do. Losing BEAST was a crushing blow to Cube Entertainment. Add that to their failure to sign SISTAR and resign 4 Minute and many are wondering if Cube Entertainment can ever recover. Many questioned whether Cube Entertainment can take girl groups to the next level. It was not wise to launch HyunA\u2018s solo career so closely with 4 Minutes debut. As all the attention went to HyunA, 4 Minute just got left behind. In fact, looking back on Cube Entertainment\u2019s history you can say their only A list hit was BEAST. Maybe they should think about restructuring their business model in regards to managing their artists. Artists: PENTAGON, BTOB, CLC, Yook Sungjae, Yoon Doojoon, HyunA, Ga Yoon, G. NA, Jang Hyun Seung, Lai Guanlin, and Lee Gikwang. Estimated Market Cap: $140 Million 7. Woollim Entertainment  Woollim Entertainment merged with SM Entertainment through SM C&C in 2013. However, three years later the two companies officially separated. Woollim Entertainment now is an independent company. Their main artists include INFINITE and Lovelyz. 2016 was all about the comeback of INFINITE and has been a success up to this point. 2017-2018 was all about INFINITE. The main topic was whether they would resign with Woollim Entertainment. The good news for Woollim was that they were able to sign INFINITE in 2018. Now they can focus on having an amazing 2019 as they make their first comeback. What can you expect in 2019? More of Golden Child? The main singer Choi Sung Yoon could be the next big K-Pop star in 2019. When they debut in August of 2017 with \u201cDamDadi\u201d there was a lot of buzz about them because of their youthfulness and high energy. The big acquisition of Woollim was Takahashi Juri of Japanese idol group AKB48. She will debut in a new girl group under Woollim Entertainment in 2019. This could be their long term plan to break into the Japanese market. They are one of the major K-pop entertainment companies that are aggressively looking to enter Japan. Artists: INFINITE, Lovelyz, JOO, Golden Child, and Nell Estimated Market Cap: $65 Million 8. Pledis Entertainment  Pledis Entertainment has had great success with their girl group After School over the past few years. However, many fans see After School as a one-hit-wonder because they have not made a lot of noise ever since \u201cBecause of You\u201d. However, still to this day After School has a strong following in China and Japan and still ranks in the mid of Korean song charts. Orange Caramel and UEE were a success in 2017 but have fizzled out. Their main group is SEVENTEEN followed by PRISTIN and NU\u2019EST. Those three groups will be pushed hard in 2019. Out of the three, only two have the potential to have a big global impact, SEVENTEEN, and NU\u2019EST. Raina will be focusing a lot on YouTube. The Pledis YouTube channel has 825,000 subscribers. They have started to upload SEVENTEEN content on the Pledis channel in hopes of raising their subscriber numbers. Artists: NU\u2019EST, SEVENTEEN, Orange Caramel, UEE, Han Don Geun, Pristin, and After School. Estimated Market Cap: $45 million 9. Starship Entertainment  FAVE Entertainment was formerly known as LOEN Entertainment and their subsidiary Starship Entertainment has had much success with their 12-member girl group Cosmic Girls and of course IU who is one of the biggest stars in Korea at the moment. IU is not only a musician but also a very successful actress. She is the driving force behind FAVE entertainment. Starship\u2019s focus for 2019 will be to continue to look into the Chinese market and Cosmic Girls which consists of both Koreans and Chinese members is their best chance for it. With SISTAR resigned and on board, Starship will look to nurture their individual abilities for potential solo careers. Male group MONSTA X partnered with Cosmic Girls to form a new unit called Y TEEN. Y TEEN consists of 7 MONSTA X members and 7 Cosmic Girls members for a total of 14 members. This is Starships plan to appeal more to young girls. MONSTA X was Starships top group in 2018. Comeback group WJSN will continue to push their comeback album as well as continue acting. Boyfriend, solo artists K.Will, Soyou, and Jung Se-woon will perform in various ways such as broadcasting. They come in at 9 on our list of the top K-pop entertainment companies. Artists: Cosmic Girls, Monsta X, Yoo Seung Woo, Hyorin, Soyou, K. Will, Mad Clown, Brother Su, Boyfriend, WJSN, JungGiGo, Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Dong Wook, Kim Bum, Kim Ji Won, Yoo Yeon Seok, Jo Yoon Hee, and SISTAR Estimated Market Cap: $10 million 10. Top Media Entertainment  TOP Media is a South Korean company. They were founded by Shinhwa member Andy. He was in charge of handling the management of several artists. They usually work with LOEN Entertainment as the distributor of musical releases. They are considered one of the top up-and-coming K-pop Entertainment companies in Korea at the moment. TOP Media\u2019s biggest success of 2018 was TEEN TOP. The group has five members: C.A.P, Chunji, Niel, Ricky, and Changjo. Originally they were a six-member group (with L.Joe, filing for contract termination in February 2017), Teen Top debuted with their first single album \u201cCome into the World\u201d way back in 2010. They are still going strong and look to take that momentum into 2019. Artists: TEEN TOP, 100%, UP10TION, Andy, Niel Estimated Market Cap: $10 million ",

            "answer_text": "I can't choose a top favorite but I am certain that my top four are these in order of who I listened to first. The Boyz - The Boyz are monster rookies. They have won rookie of the year many times already and I love that their theme is as simple as the word Boy. There songs are absolutely amazing and their new album is perfect. Bias: Hwall- Hwall is the hidden card or the ultimate weapon of the boyz. He is very baby like but tries to act Chic. He wasn't in the D.D.D. album very much because he was injured but still a great rapper singer and dancer.BTS. - BTS is no rookie. They show it with their difficult dance routines and lyrics that take skill to get right. They obviously really care about their fanbase and want to make them happy even when they hurt because of it. BTS has a great story and I'm lucky to even get this last year of it. Bangtan! Fighting!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bias: Jimin - Jimin has gone through so much in the past 7 years and yet he's still here still Fighting! He cares so much about his fans and even wants to achieve a perfection he doesn't need. Jimin is a beautiful talented singer and dancer. He also is king at mic flipping.Stray Kids - There is no denying that this band has major talent. Stray kids won their debut in a survival show against a girl group that is now known as Itzy. Stray kids don't stay to one singular genre. Their music is great from EDM to Simple pop. Wherever the STAYS are\u2026 Stray kids will stay. For them\u2026 SKZ\u2026. Bias: Felix - Felix is originally from Australia and speaks fluent english. His Korean wasnt too great at first but he has a good hold on it now. Felix started as a dancer which he is really good at but now Felix is a rapper and dancer that they have for really iconic lines. Felix is king!TXT - TxT just debuted this year and already show promising talent. Their songs are amazing with killer lines. Their choreography is amazing and they are really young idols at the age of 15\u201319. Tomorrow X Together is a band that seems just as promising as BTS and I hope they go far in the industry. TxT!!!!!!!! Bias: Beomgyu - Even though im new to the band there is no doubt that Beomgyu is my favorite. As I said they show mass talent im looking forward to seeing Beomgyu through the years. What's great is that they have no set roles so I get to see Beomgyu move around in all of them.",

            "answer_text": "I like a LOT of groups, so it's always really hard for me to choose. In the end, it boils down to Seventeen, NCT, Ateez, and A.C.E. In no particular order, here's why, in case you want to know (you probably don't but anyways): I love Seventeens music so much. Discography is a big part of whether I want to stan or not, and Seventeen is full of bops (including their b-sides). I also like them for their talent and skill. The group is very all-rounded, and they're even self-producing as well! And on top of that, their chemistry is really good, they seem like chill best friends. They're open with Carats (who are an awesome fandom) and care about them a lot. NCT's music is not as good for me as Seventeen's, but there are still a LOT of really great songs (my favorites are WayV's). NCT is also overflowing with skill and talent, and it's so hard to choose a bias, even within the sub-groups. NCT are full of living memes, and that makes for a lot of funny and interesting content. And, like Seventeen, they have great chemistry within the units and czennies are generally a funny and chill fandom. Ateez has the best discography for my music taste. I have their entire discography in my playlist, not joking. I love their music so much. Ateez are also crazy good performers, and dance skill is something I really like (and most of my biases are main/lead dancers). And finally, they're absolutely full of memes. I like A.C.E because their music is full of bops and they're generally just amazing people. They're a very all-rounded group like Seventeen- every member can hold his own when dancing, and they can all sing amazingly well, even the rappers. Also, their line distribution is freakishly even. (ahem, SM, did you hear that?) And A.C.E and Beat Interactive also feed Choices (who are probably the nicest fandom I've been in) very well with a lot of quality content. So yeah. If you're up to it, you should take a look at one or more of those. Even if you don't decide to support them, thanks for considering and learning a bit about them! Byeee ",

            "answer_text": "Without a blink, Mamamoo. This is based solely on their talents, womanhood, music and gauged intelligence. They are arguably the most talented acts in kpop and it's not just only about their vocals, but their musicality, songs, performances and their stated opinions of life in general.  Their concerts usually run for about four hours for two to three consecutive days and fan meetings run for about 3 hours. Activities include creative VCRs, revamped performances with live band, almost no MR, encore stages and cover songs done individually by the members. They never lipsync, and put their 100% into every of their performances. These girls are the epitome of hard work, perseverance and unrelenting strength.  Their musicality is top notch. They easily add adlibs to their songs at the spur of the moment. Create mash-ups, medleys, remixes of songs without much efforts. Their recent rock remix performance of Gogobebe at MGMA 2019 blew my mind away. It was shockingly good. Their live performances are creative, ever changing and interestingly engaging. Never a dull moment. They're funny, witty and all round comedic. Their opinions on life, people, etc., are very intellectual. You could tell that they're incredibly intelligent, open minded and not clout driven. Their love for music keeps them going and it's enough for me to say they are the best kpop group at the moment. Each individual members can be a successful soloist. They're that talented. Surprisingly, they never outshine each other when they're together. Each member shines exceptionally well and brings maximum efforts in the group\u2019s activities.  I could go on and on about Mamamoo, list their several abilities, but I'd leave a last note about these ladies. They're a force to reckon with. They are women who thrive well in a world filled with vile people who throw hate at them. They embrace their insecurities as humans and women and let us know that you can whoever you want to be. They are unapologetic and remind us often that you are in charge of your life and no one has the right to run your life except you. PS if you want to get to know them, I recommend the following resources: Watch their Immortal Song performances on YouTubeGo on Twitter and ask about Mamamoo, their fandom would get through to you and help you out.Listen to their music on iTunes, Spotify or whatever music content platform you pleaseWatch their live stages and get blown away.",

They are among the very few down-to-earth and genuine groups. Also,they are the best physically looking idols,they're not malnutritioned. Love Jooheon\u2019s rap. Shownu defeated my phone in terms of vibration. Their fandom is the best fandom I've ever seen. Monobebe\u2019s are really supportive to other groups too, like how amazingly they supported Z-Girls and Z-Boys on their debut stage even though none of them is Korean or sang in Korean.   3. Oh My Girl Underrated as hell. Better than gg of Big3. Has only one rapper-Mimi who's the only female idol rapper that can rap amazingly besides male rappers. YooA is a doll. Can't get over Liar Liar and Closer and Windy Day. Their latest song The Fifth Season is amazing too.  4. GFriend Have amazing choreographies. All are talented+beautiful. Their songs are extremely catchy. These girls are really nice and warm to others . Their fandom is one of the best. Still can't get over Time for Moon Night and Sunrise.  5. VIXX An amazing group. Ravi is an amazing rapper,better than other so-called rappers. I died at Leo\u2019s visuals in Scientist. Blossom Day by Ravi and GFriend\u2019s Eunha is amazing. Also,people should stop sleeping on Beautiful Liar. It has wonderful lyrics and NO,the video ain\u2019t gay. Leo and Ravi played two different personalities of a same person. One who's coward and lets the girl go (Leo played this personality) and one who can't let girl go(Ravi played this one). So,when the girl leaves,the bold personality leaves too. Starlight is an amazing fandom. I can't get over Scientist and Error. Scientist\u2019s intro is stuck in my mind for forever.   ",

            "answer_text": "EXO - I got into K-pop after hearing Descendents of the Sun Ost - By Chen ( EXO ). I watched all their mvs, variety shows etc. I loved their music a lot.BTS - Then I got into BTS . They had good music with dance and they were hilarious in the RUN BTS episodes . I literally binge watched all of them continuously.Super Junior - If you haven\u2019t listened to suju then seriously are you even a true kpop fan ? Suju hands down is the most hilarious group to ever exists in kpop. The fact that they have still managed to produce good music even after so many years is a achievement in itself. They have really strong vocals that no one can compare. They give old music to sway and bop to vibes.BIGBANG - KINGS / LEGENDS - You will always see fanwars when asked about fav kpop groups. No matter what fandom one belongs to they will ALWAYS accept BIGBANG ARE LEGENDS. They know how to have fun. They aren\u2019t like other kpop groups that have choreographed dance. They make their own rules !! Their stage performance is LIT . TOP and G-DRAGON are iconic symbols of rap and fashion. You will never hear them lip-syncing.NCT - Neo Culture Technology delivers what is promises. Music with a lot of advance tech in both audio and visual mvs. They are young cute and funny. Only NCT makes the music they are currently making - not many groups are experimenting this vibe. And they are killing it. I haven\u2019t heard a single flop song from them.Honorable Mentions - Girl GroupsGIRLS GENERATION , 2NE1RED VELVET, BLACKPINK , MAMAMOOBoy Groups - SHINEE, iKON , GOT7, SEVENTEEN, DAY6, JAY PARKI am actually an EXO - L. Because they were my first ever group. But i love listening to all the other groups . They have amazing music. Its honestly difficult to choose one of them. And everyone has a different music taste . EACH AND EVERY GROUP HAS DIFFERENT MUSIC. So I don\u2019t think we can compare them.Since BTS has gained the new popularity people think they are the best. ( which every group is for their fandom - so nothing wrong with that) Many of these new fans haven\u2019t heard the other kpop songs. BTS doesn\u2019t represent entire kpop there are many other kind of songs available. I accept they have amazing dance and music, but some groups out there have so much more to offer.",

            "answer_text": "BIG BANG  These men stole my heart back in 2014 thanks to this one:  They are Big Bang and that blue haired feast for the eyes and the heart is Choi Seung Hyun, better known as T.O.P. I saw him in the Fantastic Baby video, fell down the Kpop hole, and never recovered. I know they are getting a TON of hate lately but they have been down a very hard road over these 13 years (yep.. 13 years as a group) and these last few have been beyond difficult. Even as just a fan (a VIP) it\u2019s been hard watching them go through this. With most of them in the military, we have no clue what they are thinking or what talks they have had during this time. Seungri screwed up. We know he did. But so many people are confusing his part in the whole Burning Sun scandal with other participants that it drives me crazy. Yes, he did some shady stuff. I doubt we\u2019ll ever get the full story on any of it at this point. But he left the group. He left the entertainment industry. And the rest of the guys still are being attacked by haters. They even tried to warn Seungri about his \u201cfriends\u201d but he didn\u2019t listen. BIGBANG MEMBERS WARNED SEUNGRI | VIDEO PROOF pt.3 I\u2019ll still listen to the whole group and Seungri\u2019s solos but it\u2019s harder listening to the solos knowing what he has done to the group and the other guys. And the domino effect it had on other groups.. some of which were other favorites of mine\u2026 FTIsland, and JYJ. I will always treasure the time I got to see them all in concert (October 2,2015) and the time that they were all together. I just hope that when the other members get out of their military service, i still have a group to stan\u2026 even if they are only 4 members now. ",

            "answer_text": "A K-pop group named Apeace was the biggest, in terms of the number of group members. In 2011, they debuted with 21 members. However, they reduced the number to 15 in 2014. In terms of influence and legacy in the K-pop industry, 2nd generation groups come to mind. TVXQ, Big Bang, SHINee, and Super Junior brought international interest to K-pop and Korean culture. With their powerful vocals, catchy songs, and flashy choreo, these groups appealed to a worldwide audience and helped promote K-pop, after they released hit after hit. Some notable songs include TVXQ's Mirotic, Big Bang's Fantastic Baby, SHINee's Replay, and Super Junior's Sorry Sorry. These singles gave fans memorable first impressions of K-pop. Wonder Girls, Girl's Generation, and 2NE1 also introduced many fans to the genre. All of them produced different music styles and songs that became popular worldwide. Wonder Girl's Nobody, SNSD's Gee, and 2NE1\u2019s I Am The Best attracted many fans from the West, myself included. Their singles never got old. They create much nostalgia of people's childhood or early memories of K-pop. Their music videos are never forgotten, either. As for 3rd generation groups, the ones who currently have the biggest impact on K-pop are BTS, EXO, Seventeen, Blackpink, NCT (who will eventually expand to around 30 members), Twice, and Red Velvet.

Their music / fashion style, choreographies and concepts suit my taste the best and I absolutely love their personalities. 2- Big Bang  They are one of the groups that introduced me to Kpop and helped me realize how amazing the genre is by their unique songs and unusual styles. 3- NCT  Even though trying to learn all of their names ( The group currently has 21 members lol ) and the whole units concepts part was kind of a struggle to me at the beginning but their talents and diversity was able to gain my interest and support. Definitely worth it! If I can mention other groups who are also in my top 30 Kpop groups list then here are them in case someone wants to check their songs or something, they are all talented. ( Some disbanded though ) Also for anyone who think that I'm not stanning many girl groups. It's not cause I believe that they are not talented or cool but because I personally prefer male groups and voices / choreographies. ( I'm a tomboy lol so they fit me better ) It's a matter of taste and I'm more into badass, deep, dark and hype songs than romantic or cute ones. 4- Stray Kids  5- Ateez  6- B.A.P  7- Shinee  8- EXO  9- Monsta X  10- HOTSHOT  11- VIXX  12- Seventeen  13- Ikon  14- Infinite  15- Block B  16- 2NE1  17- Red Velvet  18- GOT7  19- TRCNG  20- Winner  21- NU\u2019EST  22- Super Junior  23- Day6  24- N.Flying  25- Dreamcatcher  26- MOMOLAND  27- Twice  28- GFriend  29- The Boyz  30- Astro  ",

            "answer_text": "These are my favourite KPop Groups :) in ranking 10. MAMAMOO The best performers in 3rd Generation Kpop, try and change my mind.They\u2019re humble, down to earth, and their music is veryyy underrated. Plus, they\u2019re beautz.  My bias : (probably) Solar  9. NCT They are honestly the best dancers among the 3rd Generation Kpop idols (personally).They are charismatic and very very very good rappers. This is an unpopular opinion, but I actually don\u2019t mind the ever growing concept of NCT as long as all of them get represented.  My bias : Wong Yukhei (Lucas) Honestly, whats not to love?  8. Super Junior The best seniors in KPop. Their music is actually so catchy and they\u2019re all in all hilarious. Sorry Sorry is the bop of the century nobody argue with me on this. Bias: Kim Heechul  7. Got7 They\u2019re excellent performers, as most of JYP artists. Good vocals, good dancing, good rapping, they\u2019re a whole package Don\u2019t have a bias  6. Red Velvet Many people may argue with me as to why I\u2019ve kept Red Velvet on number 6. To be very frank, their music has downgraded a bit after Bad Boy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re wonderful as a group, but Power Up just isn\u2019t it for me. BUT omg they\u2019re great. Also irene be slaying me everyday Bias: Bae Joo-hyun (Irene)  5. Twice I can\u2019t really call myself a twice fan as of now, but in the past half year, their music has really started to grow on me. God, I don\u2019t even know why I know all choreographies for their title songs. And i used to think Twice is cringe( USED TO I REPEAT USED TO), maybe i was influenced by other kpop fans saying so? IDK but i love them now so don\u2019t @ me. Bias: Sana   Moving on 4. BigBang BigBang is the sole reason i entered KPop, Bang Bang Bang was the song that introduced me to KPop, so I\u2019m extremely thankful to them. I became a VIP as soon as i joined, the fandom just lured me in. I felt heartbroken when they got enlisted for military, but eventually i guess everyone moves on. After all the scandals about T.O.P, I felt myself drifting away from the fandom as well as the group. But i still love them with my heart and soul, and I will support them when they come back. EDIT; okay i thought about it for a while, and im not gonna remove bigbang from the list just bc of seungri. they might not be my favs now, but they were the reason i came to kpop in the first place. sooooooooooo yeah. also why are you still reading this crap i dont understand. Bias: Taeyang  3.. EXO I haven\u2019t been into EXO for that long, just a year, but I can guarantee anyone, their vocals and the best among any other Korean Group. I may get hate for this, especially from Army, but i think everyone knows it\u2019s true. EXO has Chen who, many people can agree, is the best male singer of Korea. They have Kyungsoo, who\u2019s voice is as sweet as honey. I can go on and on. EXOs rap line is good too. They\u2019re talented in almost everything. Yes, I\u2019m an EXO-L as well as an army, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem with it. Bias : Kim Jong in <3  2.BTS They\u2019re the group that lifted me up when I was done and depressed, so I Guess, it\u2019s natural that they\u2019re my favourites. They have the best charisma and personality and honestly I\u2019ve been a bigger Stan of BTS than any other kpop group, even though I won\u2019t call myself only an army. They are the best performers, and no, they\u2019re not overrated. They deserve everything they\u2019ve got. I\u2019m not denying the fact that other kpop groups haven\u2019t struggled, but I guess those who work the hardest to overcome this struggle come up the most.  bias : Jeon jungkook thank you for reading if you haven\u2019t stopped yet 1. Blackpink Blackpink\u2019s music is exactly my kind of music. I realised I became a BLINK when i got really defensive about the members, and i cried all night because i wasnt able to attend their concert. Yes, I do agree that they\u2019re very new into the K-Pop industry, but I also believe they\u2019re capable of doing amazing when given a platform. I\u2019ve been with them since their debut, so I do have a strong attachment to them. Ros\u00e9 is literally among the best when she sings naturally, bby you don\u2019t need to change your voice for anyone, you\u2019re perfect the way you are. Lisa, my dancing queen, don\u2019t let anyone discriminate against you just because you belong to a different nationality. You\u2019re the prettiest little maknae okie ily Jisoo, you legend. I literally relate to her on a spiritual level since i have the same sense of humor and a 4D personality. You make me laugh everyday. Thank you <3 Kim Jennie, don\u2019t let anyone tell you you\u2019re lazy, or you\u2019re a bad performer. You. Are . Powerful. AND ily.  Bias: Jennie Honestly, all the rumours circulating about them \u201cbeing lazy\u201d and them \u201cbeing disrespectful\u201d aren\u2019t accurate. How can you even hate someone if you don\u2019t know them? How can you judge someone when you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through? No, I\u2019m not being defensive, I\u2019m trying to prove a point that people judge others really quick, and jump on the blame train without thinking twice on the issue.

            "answer_text": "Wow okay. This question sounds simple but for us fans we\u2019re like typing on this one freely but we're actually lowkey weighing our options here. I mean Kpop groups are slowly coming out of nowhere and everything (the music, beats, and even the visuals) is just getting better. I started listening to kpop around 2011 and what really got me hooked were f(x)\u2019s songs and stage presence. And in 2012, I chanced a yt vid starring Eunji's strong vocals from the girlgroup, Apink. (That's her on the left) \u2014so yeah both groups left me an impression, making me part MeU and part panda.  Both girl groups aren't really part of the current kpop gen (they debuted earlier than most groups now) but they certainly delivered throughout the years (and they still are!!!) I may be tad biased, but they make quality, totally rad full albums that show they're not just for show. Among my favorites are Pink tape  And Pink Revolution (idk why they love pink so much but oh well)  My current ranking of girlgroups now is: Apink (but I'm kind of down with their latest comeback and concept, FIVE wasn't really that strong. But heck they won, I dont even get it I mean Only One was reeeeaaally good I MEAN JUST WHYYY--f(x)GFRIENDCLCRed VelvetI'm still not sure with Blackpink. I think their latest track As if it's your last is kind of meh-2012itainttheendoftheworld kind of vibe so oh-kay. Also I was kind of put off with their Weekly Idol responses (except Jisoo's) and VApp vids. Aaaanyway i guess they were wrong intro vids to get to know them?? or that's just me?? But props for the choreo and visuals as alwaysI don't listen much to boygroups. The only boygroup I listen to is SEVENTEEN. I listened to all of their albums and I really like the fact that they're self-produced. ((Lately I've been slipping people into the diamond lifeu.)) I hear BTS is good tho and the fandom is just so powerful. But I havent had the chance to immerse myself in another group now\u2026 \u2026 there are just so many naaaames\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "BLACKPINK love them since debut. They basically my most favorte KPop Group. The reason why I\u2019m into Kpop.  BIGBANG already know them even before BP because of their songs like Fantastic Baby, which was seriously a huge hit. I just started digging about them when I stared around 2015.  iKON another group who has a lot of beautiful songs. Hip-hop or ballads they seriously nailed it.  TREASURE have been watching them since YGTB. They have a lot of potentials so I am looking forward to their future growth.  WINNER another group who also have a very meaningful songs. And they are also pretty funny and hilarious. I really love watching them in any shows they in.  ATEEZ been a fan since Say My Name era. Their past releases were superior. Pirate King was the best debut song in 2018. No one can tell me otherwise.  NCT know them since 2016, but I am rediscovering them this year because of \u2018KICK IT\u2019 that was pretty solid. I love them now and I am stanning them. I really love Haechan the most.  WEKI MEKI another group whom I have been following since debut. They have a lot of bside tracks that worth to listen to. They pretty underrated and it is just sad.  CIX following them because of BX/Byunggon. Been rooting for him to debut since MixNine.  KARD another group who has a lot of nice songs.  I am pretty much into YG\u2019s music, they just appeal to me a lot in general. I am randomly listens to any releases from any groups as long as the song fits my taste. I am into hiphop and edm and it shows to the group I listen to. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, to make it simple I\u2019ll break down my favorite K-pop groups into three tiers. Tier 1 is called \u201cI love this group to the point that I don\u2019t find it cringey to call myself *insert fandom name here*\u201dTier 2 is called \u201cI unknowingly go on a 16 hour rampage of streaming their music/MVs/variety content every now and then and enjoy every minute of it\u201dTier 3 is called \u201cThe groups I heavily judged/despised in the beginning for whatever reasons but am now starting to fall hard for without even realizing\u201dHonorable Mentions - 2nd gen groups that I admire for their music and concepts but never really got around to \u2018stanning\u2019 because I was not into K-pop when they were at the peak of their popularityHere it goes: Tier 1 - EXOI love this group to the point that I am willing to proudly call myself an EXO-L. I used to cringe when people referred to themselves Directioners, Beliebers, Arianators or Smiley Mileys (lol, idk what the Hannah Montana fandom is called). I vowed to never become a part of that population but then\u2026EXO hit me hard, really hard. Now, I\u2019m obsessed to the point where my WiFi name is\u2026.take a guess ;) lol, okay, it\u2019s EXO-L. Tier 2 - WINNER, GOT7, BTS, VIXX, B1A4Once I start out with watching any of their variety content on YouTube, I jump onto their MV playlist then their comeback stages then their live performances and by the time I am done it\u2019s usually 2 or 3 am. Tier 3 - TWICE, iKON, 2PMAs recent as last year, these groups possessed the capability to induce a nauseating feeling inside of me. I know it sounds bad, but I just could not stand them, like at all. Tell you what though, I wholeheartedly accept that I was a huge ass fool for subjecting them to my endless negative judgments. They\u2019re super talented and deserve every bit of recognition they have received. I sincerely wish for IKON to rise even higher and for TWICE to take over the world! As for 2PM I just have this to say \u201cWhere have y\u2019all been all my life?!?!!!\u201d I am just fascinated by the fact that even though I gave a listen to many 2nd gen groups when I finally got into K-pop, I completely skipped over 2PM! What can I say, I am repenting for my sins now. Honorable Mentions (and forever legendary) - SNSD, SHINee, Super Junior, BIGBANG",

            "answer_text": "BigBang Despite all of their controversies and especially Seungri\u2019s controversy and departure from the group, this group remains my favorite as a whole. I appreciate the fact that when they started, they weren\u2019t popular by any means but they managed to become the \u201ckings\u201d of K-Pop with hard work. YG Entertainment, despite their poor management skills, produces hits that are geared towards a Western audience instead of utilizing the typical K-Pop sound. Part of this has to do with BigBang\u2019s leader G-Dragon who writes and produces a lot of their material as well as songs for other YG artists. He had a drug scandal, which I am not necessarily saying is ok by any means but when you really look at his career, you can see that he has worked extremely hard to get to where he is today. Taeyang and Daesung\u2019s vocals fit a wide range of music. They can tackle pop, hip hop, rap, trot, R&B, etc. Their vocals also compliment each other in their songs (like Bae Bae, where they sing the same verse but they both bring something different to the table). In addition to that, both are successful solo artists, especially Daesung who is really popular in Japan. TOP is just weird, which makes him all the more interesting. His deep voice and rapping skill opposes G-Dragon\u2019s higher and nasal tone, which adds more diversity to their songs. I won\u2019t talk about Seungri due to recent events and the fact that he was my least favorite member (more due to his lack of vocals in comparison to all of the other members). Out of all of the Generation 2 groups in K-Pop, I feel like BigBang was one of the first to really emphasize the western sound. Their music usually revolves around rap and hip-hop but thanks to their vocal lineup, their songs feel really balanced and you don\u2019t tend to focus on one member. Thanks to them, they set the seeds for other YG artists to succeed in being popular with the more international audience and they were the main reason why YG Entertainment became of the Big 3. They are also very influential and other groups have claimed that BigBang are their role models (BTS, Monsta X, etc.) ",

The moments,secret moments, they have when they thought the camera isnt looking.  The way they take care of each other and make the other comfortable  That even the whole day they arent together,they always find each other at the end Sorry if i dont have a picture but i have more The subtle glances and nervous looks they give each other How the other members seem to know whats going on and are always protecting them,or even gonna stop them if its too much Jikook\u2026 They are the ship that are subtle and always caught behind cameras. The Ship that always backhugs each other with or without camera. When i watch every jikook moments or analysis (from KookMin world, she is the best okayy) i always think\u2026 okay it makes sense\u2026i mean that isnt something \u201cbestfriends\u201d do. They literally are eyef*cking each other on camera. They lick their lips and tease each other all the time. The way Jeon can always follow or know where his beloved Chim is\u2026 The way Jeon clicks his tounge on his cheeks whenever someone is being close and flirty with Jimin. The way his smile would light up when Jimin laughs. The way Jimin takes care of Jungkook and confess his love on camera. The way Jimin thinks of Jungkook all the time. The way Jimin laughs so hard that his eyes disappear into cute crescents everytime Jungkook makes a stupid joke or just do something funny. <mJikook..i cant even say that they arent real\u2026If they arent a couple yet then maybe they are hiding their feelings because they are in a group. If they are already a couple then they are just scared of announcing it considering Korea is against Same Sex Relationship. ",

            "answer_text": "To be very honest, I'm a huge multi stan (shocker, as if my name didn't give that out) but on a serious note I stan a lot of groups that if I was this serious about my studies, I'd honestly be Albert Einstein smart. Even though I'm relatively new to kpop having gotten into them late last year, I've honestly come across many talented groups, bands and solo artists. I'm starting from my ultimate kpop group. 1. Ateez  My best rookie group!!! Now, I know they're rookies and all and they're just beginning their career, like they haven't even been around for a year but these guys completely and passionately stole my heart. I don't know what it is about them that I just love so much, maybe its the way they perform, the energy and vibe they radiate in both MVs and on stage, the vocals, the synchronized dances, their personalities, the visuals! Or maybe because I'm a 4th generation kpop fan (yes, I dared to say that) and I basically started with them from their pre-debut, I just have this special connection with them! Everything about them seems so alluring. I'm totally whipped for them and you can't imagine how excited I must be for their comeback! My bias is our one and only Korean Big Minion, leader Hongjoong! He's really amazing in every way possible that I can't even begin to count. The other members are my bias wreckers, Every. Single. One! They all bias wreck me so bad I'm actually considering it illegal. Moving on! 2. Exo  They were my first love in kpop! If not for them, I don't think I'd have gotten into kpop as much as I'm in now. The first time I heard their song, \u2018Monster', the inner detective in me arose that I immediately went to the web and learnt all their names and other information written about them on kpop profiles within five minutes. I never knew I could store so much information in my brain during that time frame. The vocals, the visuals, the way they moved just enticed me and I fell for them instantly. Had it been I hadn't yet found Ateez they'd have been my ultimate group. 3. Bts  I'm sure some expected them to be on the list. As happy as I am to admit, I'm a proud Army. All their songs spoke to me in with completely different meanings. It amazes me how they connect songs they did years ago with their present ones, telling a story in one way or the other. The only reason they weren't no.1 is because I get confused sometimes (let me finish, don't come at me!) Like I said before, I got into kpop late last year, so you can imagine the amount of catching up I'd need to do if I wanted to understand the song connection they had years ago with their present songs. That's a lot! Plus the theories, I'm not smart enough to understand them, start connecting the dots with the small hints they've dropped in their previous MVs, I'd have to go wayyy back, notice the trivial things and start coming up with theories. I know some may be able to do this but have I mentioned how lazy I am? You can't even begin to comprehend. I give up on the littlest things if I can't do something on my first few trials, I drop it. Its a bad habit of mine but what can I do... But other than what I mentioned I love them! My bias is Taehyung and bias wrecker is Kookie!!! (Lowkey chanting Vkook) 4. Ikon  This group of crackheads is what I live for oml!!!! I found out about them earlier this year and one thing I noticed in them before listening to their music is how extremely funny, laid back and down to earth they are! Honestly I just watch some of their clips and my day immediately brightens! They're my daily dosage of happy pills and don't even get me started on their music! Killing me, the first of their songs I listened to legit killed me! This is one thing I love about kpop, its not only about the vocals, the visuals, the dance but the instrumentals are important too and Ikon has never failed to give me the best. I honestly love them and their songs! Though I miss the crazy Ikon but the sentimental ones too do justice to my taste! My bias is Bobby and bias wrecker(s) are B.I and Jinhwan though Junhoe (June) gets me too! 5. NCT  NCT is everything I could ask for! Honestly the diversity in this group seriously gets me. Plus their sub units are what makes the group so special. They've been climbing up my best kpop groups ever since I discovered them. My bias is Taeyong and bias wrecker, the whole NCT Dream and 127, plus NCT U and Way V! 6. A.C.E  This group right here is what I call an underrated one! For real after discovering them weeks ago with their latest comeback \u2018Undercover', I can't believe how much they've actually grown on me. I actually beat myself about just discovering them now and even though I'm still learning things about them, I have just four words to say, \u2018DON'T SLEEP ON THEM!\u2019 they're really talented! My bias is Jun nd bias wrecker(s) are the rest of the group! 7. Seventeen  Seventeen releases too many bops I can't begin to count. In my opinion(MY opinion) I feel they're underrated. All their songs I've listened to are so good! Honestly people should stop sleeping on them. I don't even have a bias coz I can't decide. They're all my bias!!!!! Much love from me to them! 8. Oneus  Yeeeep!!!! Have I said their latest comeback is a bop?!! Well, I'm saying it now, their latest comeback, \u2018Twilight\u2019 is a bop!!! Though they're also new to the K-pop industry, they hold a place in my heart. Bias wrecker Leedo and bias wrecked by all!!! Other honorable mentions (coz I'm too lazy to continue) Stray Kids Got7 Big Bang Day6 N.Flying Vixx Nuest Super Junior Twice Mamamoo CLC (G)-Idle KARD Pentagon Wanna One(although they disbanded, I still love them dearly!) The Guys etc I do not really have much gg I stan and I also'm yes y'all noticed, but bg are more my style for reasons everybody knows, but I acknowledge gg tend to be soo good and I pay attention to their songs but in addition to the people regarding listing, I don't stan similar to their songs(MY viewpoint). Additionally most of groups we stan are typically new teams or perhaps not too-old people and once more like I stated i am a 4th generation kpop stan, i am still-new but still discovering old kpop teams but to actually stan is difficulty. I hope I didn't bore y'all using this longg rant ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to do a full answer to this about three groups. (They\u2019re all boy groups btw) I\u2019m writing long answers about each one of them because they deserve more love uwu <3 THE ROSE - they\u2019re not considered a kpop group but I love them too much so I just had to add them. They\u2019re a Korean band who focuses more on indie music. They consist of 4 members and debuted in 2017. They\u2019re honestly really talented and the members are the sweetest guys ever (and they\u2019re complete dorks lmao) But honestly, what attracted me to them is their music. Personally, they are my favorite group (for music) in Korean. There\u2019s something so pure and relatable about their music I just love it. They have feel good songs that can be crying songs- it all depends on your mood. My favorite album of them is Void. And it\u2019s actually my favorite album in Korean. It\u2019s a really good album and if you want to start to listen to them start from there! Here\u2019s the link to their profile in Spotify: The Rose Here\u2019s the link to their kpop profile incase you want to learn more about them and facts: The Rose Members Profile (Updated!) HERE\u2019S SOME PICTURES OF THE GORGEOUSLY TALENTED BOYS.    (Hajoon is so done with everything and anything) next group! GOT7 - I swear to god I love them more than anything. They\u2019re a kpop group with seven members that debuted in 2014. And those seven members, are they reason why I live lmao. They are the most chaotic crackheads I know. I legit want to hit them because the things they say some times and other times, I just want to kiss them lmao. What attracted me to this group was the members. They have the purest relationship in the whole kpop industry. They\u2019re the realest of the realest and I can bluntly say the seven of them are brothers. They also have really good music! I went to their concert in July and talk about energy! They have really good stage presence and bde as well\u2026 let\u2019s hope none of you get that. My favorite album from them is spinning top! You start there seeing how it\u2019s one of their music recent albums if you want to listen to them. This is the link to their Spotify profile: GOT7 Their kpop profile: GOT7 Members Profile (Updated!) SOME PICTURES OF THE PRETTIEST yet weirdest BOYS EVER    The dorkiest kids I swear  Oh I\u2019m sorry Jaebum that\u2019s not supposed to go in there. I suddenly don\u2019t know how to delete a picture. Final one! My ultimate group, you\u2019ve guessed it probably lmao BTS - I have no words for this group. Not only is their music amazing, but the members have beautiful personalities. They are a seven member group that debuted in 2013. The members are probably the most passionate people I\u2019ve ever met. They work hard to get what they want to get and they\u2019re humble about it. They all get along really well and have a very real relationship. They\u2019re also crackheads and love having fun. They\u2019re calm but adventurous and their content is amazing! They always make you laugh no matter what and their group wouldn\u2019t be the same without any of them. I also love the fact that they write their own songs. They express themselves about topics that are not touched in kpop because it\u2019s controversial (insecurities, depression, mental illnesses, loneliness, etc) Knowing that the words that they\u2019re saying comes from their big heart and their unique minds just makes it more special. My favorite album from them is Dark & Wild. It\u2019s actually my second favorite Korean album. Despite this, you should probably not start with this album of your going to listen to BTS. This is not their style of music anymore (sadly :\u2019c) so I would recommend their album \u201cSpeak Yourself: Tear\u201d. It\u2019s a really good album and it\u2019s kinda recent (early 2018) and it\u2019s their style of music now (kinda I hope it is lmao). That album has some of my favorite BTS songs such as Paradise, So What and Love Maze. It\u2019s one of their more calm albums but it\u2019s really good! (After you listen to them for a while, listen to Dark & Wild. It\u2019s such an underrated album but it\u2019s their best album) Here\u2019s their Spotify profile: BTSTheir kpop profile: BTS (Bangtan Boys) Members Profile: BTS Facts; BTS Ideal Type (Updated!) HERE\u2019S SOME PICTURES OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BOYS YOU\u2019LL EVER SEE ,,, I still don\u2019t understand how they can be so hot and cute at the same time\u2026 my heart is torn </3    ",

Literally the only reason that my account has some popularity- Anyways, I have a huge list of K-Pop groups that I listen to, and I couldn\u2019t name them all off the top of my head, so I\u2019ll just try to limit it to like.. ten? And go from there. EXO: Oh my god, I don\u2019t even know how to explain how much I love EXO. EXO was my startoff group, and it was my ult! And it still is to this day! The dancing! The music! The P E R S O N A L I T Y! Gosh I could go on forever! Their music is literally my favorite of all of them, and honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be the same person I am today without them! I have to watch out when buying things, my parents don\u2019t seem to mind BTS merch as much as EXO, as well as the fact that EXO merch is hard to find. But I will get my albums and lightstick if it kills me.BTS! I love BTS, I have an army bomb and albums, and even a sweatshirt! their concepts are stunning, and the people behind all of it are absolutely amazing in just themselves. It can be hard to be a K-Pop idol, and it\u2019s difficult to live that lifestyle, but they do it very well and BTS just has that way of doing things to benefit themselves.VAV: I\u2019ve been getting into VAV a little bit lately, and I\u2019ve been really liking their music! They\u2019re all just so cute, and the things that they post are real! It\u2019s like.. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but they somehow manage to show that they are human and they aren\u2019t afraid of laughing and being a little messy in videos, even on the official page. I could dance to their music forever honestly, and I just want to get more into the group!!Red Velvet: I love Red Velvet, they\u2019re a bunch of literal vocal powerhouses and it\u2019s really quite stunning. I just love them all, and let\u2019s be honest.. they\u2019re all really fricking hot. There we go, I\u2019ve said it! They haven\u2019t been on my list for too long now, but I really do love their music and I\u2019d die to dance to just one song of theirs correctly.Day6: This group plays all their music, and honestly their music was the music of choice for me while I was traveling late last summer. I can\u2019t not love them, and it\u2019s always a shock to my father to hear k-pop that\u2019s been played and sang entirely by the band members. He still thinks they all sound like girlsiKon: currently still getting into them, but honestly, I\u2019m Okay, Killing Me, and Love Scenario, can all step on me and I\u2019d still love them. These songs are the bomb to dance too and I can dance around my basement like an idiot for a whole ass hour listening to these and still do it all over again.Like, all the NCTs. All of them. Whiplash and Regular are frickin bops and I can\u2019t not love them, I\u2019m running out of reasons to explain with because they are all really good artists and groupsSo I\u2019m gonna end it here until I get another group I just have to obsess over, so that\u2019s all for now! I love each of my groups dearly, even if I don\u2019t learn the names of each member from each group! I love them all! ",

They have me dying of laughter on all of their variety shows (except the real Got7 4 that can choke) They have good music album wise. Plus their amazing performers. Really attractive as well. They update a lot so your always connected. They write and produce their own music. \u25cf IKON  I love them because they're the coolest group ever (anyone agree? They're the kind of group that could make you go WOO!!! All of them are great dancers(I can't spot one terrible dancer in IKON, can you? They all dance great with their amazing choreography. No one can dance like that without enough SWAG in self. Their songs can make you feel all sort of emotions. But now B.I is gone . It breaks my heart. I hope fans petition works out and YG bring B.I back to this group. \u25cf BIGBANG  The attitude and talent of each member makes them gain the love from the audience: G-Dragon\u2019s stance as a leader and faked \u201ccold\u201d attitude, T.O.P\u2019s rapping style and his sarcastic and 4D-like sense of humor, Taeyang\u2019s sweet voice and charming \u201ceye smile\u201d and Daesung\u2019s powerful voice and sense of caring a lot for everybody. Each characteristic makes them gain more and more fans everywhere. \u25cf INFINITE  I got into Infinite when I watch the Drama \"Shut Up Flower Boy Band\" and ever since I saw L I was like oh wow lol and then I found Infinite because of him and now he's my bias thank you L . Infinite are talented and their synchronization is amazing . \u25cf MONSTA X  Monsta X can put a big smile on my face by just standing and doing nothing. Monsta X is one of the groups that I listen to EVERY SINGLE one of their songs! All of their songs are seriously so amazing Monsta X and their dances! Wow wow wow their dances are seriously so unique and upbeat and fast. \u25cf EXO  Their songs are addicting as well I mean their song MONSTER. That song I listen every single day. Even without make up they look sooo good! Especially in award shows they kill me with their visuals!they have the most difficult choreographies and they are organized and doing it together. \u25cf SUPER JUNIOR  I like this group because the different music they give, suju as a whole, D&E, kry, suju M, kyuhyun ryeowook every sub-unit/ member gives different feeling/music. Every member is successful with his individual activities, but they are successful as a group too, they are a multi talented group : Mcs, actors, singers, composers, musical actors, they do cartography too.... They tried everything tbh \u25cf KARD  Kard is a coed kpop group, they get a special thread.There song Oh NaNa is so damn catchy I really wanna see how they're gonna do and how they're preformances will go with the award shows and what category they'll go in... \u25cf ASTRO  Astro is probably the only group where I enjoy cute concepts from a boy group (with some exceptions from a few) Astro is filled with dorks! And that's why I love them! Astro is a group that shows their true selves on and off stage! They have seriously grown so much in only a year it's crazy! I've been with Astro since god knows when! I saw their drama \u201c Time to be continued\u201d. They debuted their group through this drama. So, i m huge fan of this group from starting. Have a good day. Deevin~ ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to choose 6 of my favorite groups - 3 boy groups and 3 girl groups. First up: Twice  Twice has an extraordinary discography and they\u2019re similar to Apink in that they continuously grow better and better the longer they\u2019re together. This is the group that got me into K-pop and have stayed at the top of my list as my ult female group for the past 2 1/2 years I\u2019ve been a fan. They\u2019re letting their inner artists show themselves more and I\u2019m forever proud of them. Next: Stray Kids  Stray Kids were the first boy group I ever became a fan of, and they got me interested in other boy groups. I held them at the top of my list for a long time until certain things happened. I still really love their music and think that they\u2019re going to continuously do amazing in the music world. ITZY  They\u2019re new, yes, but I think they\u2019re doing really well and are slowly settling into their skin. Their music is good and they have a lot of potential to continue their rise to stardom. I also like that all of them are within my age range (born after 2000) which allows me to relate to them a bit more than some of the other groups I like. I feel inspired seeing them do what they love. Now, for the NON-JYP groups \ud83d\ude02 Ateez  Ateez have stolen my heart and they are truly phenomenal. From the passionate performances they give literally ALL THE TIME to the chaos and hilarity that they bring with them, Ateez is truly carving a place for themselves as one of the groups to pay attention to. Their music is fun and theatrical, but also meaningful and emotional. Their brotherhood is something to admire, and if you like storylines behind the music and MV\u2019s, Ateez is definitely the group for you. Everything has a meaning - from the stage outfits to the sets. Mamamoo  Mamamoo are truly amazing. They have outstanding vocals and beautiful personalities, and they know how to hype up a crowd. Mamamoo are versatile in style and can pull off a variety of concepts. They truly are some of the Queens of K-Pop. You can trust in their performances 100%. Finally, Seventeen  Seventeen are powerhouses. From the focused units playing to their strengths and the family-like bond they share, Seventeen truly have some of the most talented individuals. Dance, vocals, rap - all of it is superb. They also make sure to feed Carats the content they\u2019re craving. Seventeen are really impressive and absolutely hilarious, so I love them a lot. I know that half the groups have been around for 5+ years and the other half have over a year to their name, but these are just some of the groups whose music I enjoy. There are so many talented groups who deserve the recognition, but I didn\u2019t want to spend hours on a post lol. ",

            "answer_text": "This is goigg to be a long list, bare with me. In no particular order: Astro. I really love them. I started liking them two days after their debut ( a new record) after I stumbled upon their song accidentally. I really hated the cute concept and theirs was such a cute concept. But the song was catchy, the choreography was interesting and there was a moment that convinced me. I still like them a lot, I feel like, even though they are from a less experience d company, they themselves are really great idols. Each one has a specialty that they master, and together they are a very competent and complete group. They're also really chaotic and funny and I really like their songs, even (sometimes especially) the B-tracks.Seventeen. Again, I really love them. It took me a while to give them a chance, because I (was the only one in the world who) didn't like Mansae. But once I did, I became a fan right away. I love their professionalism, their songs and choreographies. But I also love that each one is different, to a greater extent than many other groups, and that they seem to genuinely have a good relationship within the group. I love that the more quiet members still get attention and shine, and I love that the more out-there members do their best to include everyone. That was what really got me into them, the way they seem to promote each other before promoting themselves. In an industry with that high competition, it is not as easy to do as it seems.Shinee. God, I used to love them. Lately my time for kpop was limited to zero, and they were the first to fall, but they are so so good. Except for Minho (don't come for me, it's just an opinion). I really loved their songs, and their vocal ability always blew me away. Jonghyun might have been the best vocalist in kpop, in my very subjective opinion. And the rest were super good too. Sherlock will forever be my favourite Kpop song.Super Junior. They're crazy. And that's why I'm a fan. Because they're crazy. I discovered them by mistake when I was watching Shinee stuff back in the day, and the first one I found was Heechul. Best way to start right there. I really like their songs, most of them. I went through their entire discography a few times and I like about 80% of it, which is a lot seeing as it's huge and it goes through a lot of different kpop levels. But still, what I mostly like about them is their craziness.Vixx. I haven't followed them in a while but I used to like them a lot. N was probably my favourite dancer in kpop, and I really liked Ken\u2019s voice and Ravi. I didn't really like Shangri La, don't know why, and after that I stopped having the time to follow them like before, but they are really talented. I don't really like Leo\u2019s singing technique, but that again is a subjective thing. He is really talented.EXO. Mainly the up-to-Monster eras, but after as well. They were my first group (kind of, but yeah) and I joined during their Love me right times. I really liked them, from Baekhyun\u2019s chaos to Lay\u2019s chill and from Xiumin\u2019s sexy self to Xiumin\u2019s cute self. I can see their experience showing while they perform, especially lately that I don't really like the materials they get. What drew me to them was\u2026 Well\u2026Baekhyun being crazy mainly. And I used to really like Suho as a whole. It kind of hurts to see them fade away, but it was bound to happen, they have left their legacy behind and will continue to thrive in the future.Old NCT stuff. I used to love NCT before they moved their focus to the US. Their vocalists were so good and their dancers were so good. Marks \u201clong ass ride\u201d will stay with me forever. I don't really like their style of music, it isn't for me, and that is OK. I have kind of moved on from them when my time for kpop diminished, but they are really good. Don't be scared by the number, it doesn't matter. Pick the group you like and it's just like any other group. I know all 21 of them, but I learnt them by chunk and it didn't feel like too much. I felt they were more distinctive than idols in other groups, but that depends on each person.I should include some girl groups as well, so Mamamoo. They are so so good, I loved their singing and their live performances. I like many of their songs, too. I can't say much about their personalities, because I started liking them in a time when I couldn't really follow them anymore, but still. They're great singers.Dreamcatcher. I loved loved loved the concept and their songs. They are the only girl group I follow now, just the songs because that's all I have time for. I really like them, the rock-ish sound and the horror concepts.Bands probably don't count, but if they do, FtIsland is right there on top. Fighting for the first spot. Because if Jonghyun is the best vocalist in kpop, Hongki is the best vocalist ever. I love their songs, pretty much all of them, and Hongki is so so good. I first discovered them when I was watching Super Junior stuff and Hongki was always right there with Heechul, but it took me a while to realise that Hongki and this Hongki were the same Hongki. I love him, and his group mates as well (not Jonghoon, I didn't really like him from the start but now I actually have a reason). I love their honesty, even if it's harsh, and I love their music.",

            "answer_text": "I have three ultimate fave groups: BTS I first got into BTS because of my niece. She said I looked like Jin. (i don\u2019t think so, but apparently it\u2019s not only Jin I\u2019ve been told I look like. I\u2019ve been told I look like RM and someone from Twice, and at least one member from a bunch of other kpop groups) The thing that got me into BTS was their rap line (my biases) and Jhope, specifically his dancing. I like their songs, the personalities they show through their performances and variety shows. i went to their concert when they came to Hamilton and I just LOVED it. 2. Mamamoo  I LOVE them so much. My husband says I look and act like Solar. I tell him he needs glasses. I first got into them when I came across their Starry Night video and I remember thinking Solar looked like the Korean Daenerys. All I can say is their Cds do not do their voices justice when compared to their live performances. They remind me of my favourite girl group En Vogue. I don\u2019t have a bias because I love them all so much. 3. Monsta X  I admit I liked this group for Shownu and Shownu only. But when I finally listened to their songs, I loved them, especially the rap line. As much as I thought Shownu was the most beautiful creature in the world, I can now honestly say that has changed and I don\u2019t have a bias as I find each and every one of them beautiful inside and out. All in all, I think these three groups are so funny, sincere and so talented. My autistic daughter, who is low functioning and nonverbal, likes BTS. I remember last year when we went to Mexico, she played BTS nonstop, especially \u201cBest Of Me\u201d and \u201cSilver Spoon.\u201d Now she plays nonstop Jhope\u2019s \u201cJust Dance,\u201d Mamamoo\u2019s b side song from their Blue;s CD \u201cMorning,\u201d and Jooheon\u2019s song \u201cRunway.\u201d She also likes making videos on my phone with the songs as background music. This is the one she did when we were in Mexico. \u00a00:00-0:30 ",

            "answer_text": "Get ready for a long explanation. 1. BTS  People who don\u2019t listen to BTS often think of them as overrated. But it\u2019s truly impressive the success they have received worldwide. And it\u2019s not just their popularity and fame that is mindblowing, but the influence they have over youths today as well as their outstanding talent. They write about deeply profound things that people of my generation struggle with today. Not only do they speak through their music, but through the causes they take up. They launched a campaign called Love Myself, in an effort to end violence toward children and teens. You can see the passion they have for such causes in everything they do. All in all, you can tell each member has a big heart with so much to give to the world. All we need to do is listen. Bias: Jungkook  Not only do I think he has an angelic voice and can dance very well, but he\u2019s overall just a genuine, passionate individual. I admire those qualities in a person. He also enjoys doing photography like me. 2. SHINee  Where do I even begin? This group has been through so much. I felt it only right that I include a picture of them with the late Jonghyun. In December of 2017, he committed suicide. Since then, SHINee has continued to go strong, still releasing quality music. But they will always be different without him. Still, SHINee is the first K-pop group I listened to. They were what got me into the K-pop fandom with their hit \u201cSherlock.\u201d Bias: Taemin  I knew immediately that Taemin, the maknae, was my bias. In fact, he\u2019s my ultimate bias in all of K-pop. I still stan him to this day even in his solo career. I think he\u2019s one of the most talented people in K-pop. He has a strong eye for aesthetics, and he comes up with some of the nicest concepts for his own music videos. If you haven\u2019t seen the dance choreography for his hit \u201cMove,\u201d you need to! 3. B.A.P  I realize B.A.P is going through a lot right now. Yongguk left (supposedly,) Himchan has been accused of sexual assault, their contracts are nearing their expiration. Overall, their future is very uncertain. I only really mention B.A.P specifically because of how talented they are. Even though he\u2019s no longer a member, I want to speak on Yongguk a little bit. On their second studio album \u201cNoir,\u201d he, along with Zelo, wrote one of the deepest, most meaningful songs based on his own struggles with mental illness, called \u201cPray.\u201d He has never performed it live because he says that he felt so bad while writing the lyrics, that he doesn\u2019t want to relive those feelings. Having depression and anxiety myself, it really touched me on a personal level. I admire the fact that he\u2019s not afraid to write or speak about such things, and I really feel for him. Another thing\u2026if you haven\u2019t seen any of their music videos, you need to go on YouTube and watch them now. Specifically the ones for \u201cOne Shot\u201d and \u201cSkydive.\u201d This group deserves an Oscar. Also, Zelo answered a comment of mine on a live stream once. You can imagine what a happy BABY I was. Bias: Yongguk  I know, I know. He\u2019s not a member anymore. But the bias award goes to him nevertheless. Because, despite not personally knowing him, I still feel a personal understanding with regards to him and his own struggles. And he\u2019s so talented in writing song lyrics that convey those struggles. Other honorable mentions, in no particular order: EXONCTMonsta XBlackpinkPentagonINFINITEWinnerBig BangGOT7K.A.R.D",

            "answer_text": "May favorite groups are the following: VIXXThese guys may be my favorite K-pop group of all time. VIXX, also known as concept-dols, always do their absolute best with every comeback and never disappoint.  Monsta XI also find Monsta X very talented. I used to be a huge fan of them, but my love for this group is now more casual. I love all of the boys and hope they will succeed more in the future because they deserve it.  EXOThese buys never cease to amaze me with their awesome vocal and harmonizing skills. They are insanely talented (save the rapping part, which is not so good in my opinion) and deserve their popularity.  SF9Even though they debuted recently compared to other groups, they still managed to make it to my favorites due to their hard work and randomness (see Mamma Mia). I hope they\u2019ll become more popular in the future.  PentagonI started stanning this group more recently with their comeback \u201cShine\u201d an can testify that I do not regret it in the slightest. Hui and Jinho are easily some of my favorite vocalists in K-pop, while I also enjoy their rap line. What\u2019s there not to like?  BTSBTS are the first group I was into and they have not failed me yet. While I (as well as many other fans) didn\u2019t like LY:Her, I believe that Tear was one of their best works after Wings.  NCTWhile other people dislike it, I find their concept really interesting and promising. My favorite subunit is NCT U.  SHINeeI have nothing to say about them other than asdfghjkl. And RingDingDong RingDingDong RingDingDong. They are the kings.  ",

            "answer_text": "Monsta X. Obvisouly :) I've been a Monbebe since they had their debut. I've been with them since No Mercy but since the group hadn't officially had their debut, there wasn't a fandom name at the time of 'No Mercy'. Although they weren't the first group to get me into K-Pop (that was BIGBANG) nor were they the first group I fell in love with (that was also BIGBANG), they immediately caught my attention. Although I still love BIGBANG, I love Monsta X more than any other group or soloist. There's just something about them that I vibe really well with. I love being able to watch them grow and become more successful and start to get the amount of recognition, love, and care they should be receiving (it's still not nearly enough). As you guessed it, I'm going to be explaining what I love about every member and how they captivated my attention. Lets start with the leader himself, Shownu (Son Hyunwoo)    I love this man, so much. At first you may think he\u2019s quiet, boring, and reserved. Well, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s a dork, just like the rest of the members. His dancing skills really impressed me along with his vocals. He deserves so much love and care, so much. He deserves all the success he\u2019s worked to earn and more. His talent should not go unrecognized. Nor should his beauty. Next member up is Lee/Shin Hoseok AKA Wonho!    I love him so much. You don\u2019t even understand the amount of love I have for him. I am ready to fight in order to keep him safe, protected, happy, and loved. He means the absolute world to me and I can\u2019t ever imagine that changing. Yes, he has a nice body but he also has an absolutely amazing personality. He is so sensitive and so caring. He cares deeply for others, especially the people he loves. I can\u2019t begin to explain how this man is the absolute best. You can disagree but don\u2019t you dare leave any nasty comments about him. I don\u2019t care what you think, just keep your thoughts to yourself. Keep your nasty, hateful comments away from Wonho. I don\u2019t want him seeing them. No MONBEBE would ever want any of the members seeing a hurtful comment, especially Wonho. Why especially Wonho? He\u2019s the most caring, sensitive, emotional member of Monsta X. We want to protect our little baby bunny. He doesn\u2019t deserve any hate thrown his way and he needs to be protected from all the bad things in the world. His vocals are amazing. He\u2019s amazing. His visuals are amazing. No matter what anyone says, Wonho will always be an important member of Monsta X. All of them are important. That includes Wonho. I\u2019m sick and tired of seeing posts that say \u201cOh, Monsta X wouldn\u2019t be any different without Wonho\u201d. Actually, yes it would. There would be no Monsta X if there was no Wonho. They are all like a family and they wouldn\u2019t let one member be removed and continue promoting without him. They stick together, no matter what. That\u2019s already been proven. He is a crucial member of the group. I wouldn\u2019t have the group any other way. Nor would I have Wonho in any other group than Monsta X. If you can\u2019t see how much he is worth than you\u2019re not a true MONBEBE. You\u2019re just blind. This man deserves the entire world. He deserves so much love, protection, care, and kindness. It\u2019s time that he gets the amount of love, respect, protection, care, and kindness that he has been giving to us. Alright, Next member. Lee Minhyuk.    The quirky little boy. The sunshine of the group. I love him so very much! His energy is something I vibe with really well. He never fails to put a smile on my face. He can cheer me up in a heartbeat. That\u2019s how contagious his mood is. He\u2019s absolutely hilarious. His vocals are outstanding and his visuals are just wow. I\u2019m so happy he had his debut. Monsta X wouldn\u2019t be complete without him. Next member is Lee Kihyun.    Such a cutie. I love him so much. His vocals are absolutely the best, no matter what anyone says. Listen to him sing and you\u2019ll agree. His visuals, wow, I refuse to believe he isn\u2019t a visual. He\u2019s so pretty. Don\u2019t look his pretty looks deceive you though. He\u2019s evil. He\u2019s an evil little short, powerful, sensitive vocalist. I love him though and I will protect him with my whole heart. Can you guess who\u2019s next? If I\u2019m going in order of age\u2026..Chae Hyungwon    Wow. I love this man so much. No joke. He means so much to me. He is literally Kermit the frog. His visuals are absolutely amazing and his vocals are stunning. Starship needs to give him more lines. Let his voice shine! He is seriously such a dork though. You can\u2019t help BUT to fall in love with him. We got the one who spits fire up next. Lee Jooheon.    The man himself. I love him so, so much. He was my first ever bias in Monsta X. He captivated my attention and heart. The love I have for him is so powerful and strong. It\u2019s impossible for me to ever get rid of that love. He has made me smile and laugh when I needed to the most. He is very important to me, just like all the other members. He holds a special place in my heart and no one will ever take that away from him. Next we got the oldest looking maknae. Im Changkyun    I love him. Really, I do. Nothing in this world could ever change that. He makes my heart beat fast and my eyes light up whenever I see him. His voice is ultimately my favorite in Monsta X, maybe even in the entire K-Pop industry. His dorky side is what made me fall in love with him though. He\u2019s so quirky and lovable. He tries to act tough but in reality, he is a big baby who needs all the protection there is. His raps are literal fire. When he raps, I get immersed into the song. Whether it be if I\u2019m jamming out to Monsta X\u2019s music or walking with earbuds in listening to their music, whenever Changkyun raps, I stop. I stop and listen to his voice. His voice is so soothing. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a lot :) My ULT group is BTS I love their various discography, and the amount of growth they\u2019ve made. Even in scandals they admit their wrong doings. Namjoon for example in BTS\u2019 early days said the N word. I\u2019m Black, and I was digusted by the clip. It made me so uncomfortable and I just hated it. Made me question a lot about supporting them. After the performance, he aplogized and acknowledged his ignorance. That was around 2014. He has now currently shown so much growth between then and now. Namjoon has even brung it up again talking about it. I truly believe he is a good person, and has shown a want to change his mindset for the better. I could honestly go about how much I love them all tbh. You can tell they truly care for each other as a group, especially some of the stories they share. Of course I have no idea about them in IRL, but I feel I get a good idea whenever I watch them. NCT NCT is something I truly love, they were my second kpop group. Despite there being 18 members, now 21. I can still tell them all apart. What amazing combinaton of personalities, like wow SM I\u2019m actually applauding you for something. So happy to see these crackhead together. Even though it is legit hard to pick a bias. Right now I cannot pick between, Taeyong, Mark, Yuta, Winwin or Lucas. Im truly happy to see each member thrive. I hope people give them more chances, I know the group size can be overwhelming. NOTE: GIVE WINWIN, YUTA AND JOHNNY MORE LINES SM. I swear they\u2019re trying to kill Winwin off, I\u2019m not okay it. Legit they did a version of one of their songs in Mandarin Chinese and didnt give WinWin anymore lines\u2026 even though its in his native language, same with Yuta and the Japanese releases. Also Johnny didnt train for 9\u201310 years for this bullshit you\u2019re displaying SM. Im coming for u. BLACKPINK My favorite girl gorup. People will hate, I\u2019ve seen it. But I really do see talent in them. Rose\u2019s vocals have to be my favorite. She\u2019s so talented, they all are honestly. I really do wish people would listen to her sing on Masked Singer. People say Jisoo is just a pretty face, but her vocals are SO soothing. Lisa is so talented with her rapping, but NO ONE EVER pays attention to the fact she was originally trained as a vocalist. I also love her dancing, espeically with NCT\u2019S Ten that one time. Jennie, I love her but know I was annoyed and so dissapointed by her slack on some stages. Iireally think she can rap, but I wish YG would keep her on just vocals. I dunno, I just really miss hearing her vocals. Though her rapping is great as well. GIVE THEM A FULL ALBUM YG I have groups that I like such as TWICE, MONSTA X, IKON, PENTAGON, ASTRO, OH MY GIRL, MAMAMOO, GFRIEND,CLC, GOT7. EXO, MOMOLAND, SEVENTEEN, PRISTIN, BIGBANG (minus u know who) and so one. But I don\u2019t hard core stan them like the three above. But lowkey can assure you in the next two months Monsta X and Got7 somehow end up on this list. ",

RED VELVET  They've fallen in the ranks but \u201cPsycho\" breathed new life into them. 7. GFRIEND  2019 was very exciting for them and they've been running thru 2020. 6. MAMAMOO  The only reason they aren't FIRST is because the competition is stiiiiiff. 5. BIG BANG  I'm still holding on. 4. BLACKPINK  See \u201cBig Bang.\u201d 3. BTS  I didn't like \u201cOn,\u201d but they've otherwise kept my interest. Mostly, because of Suga's recent project. 2. OH MY GIRL  What a surprise and delight. I've always liked them as people and respected them as performers. But they've been blowing my mind consistently for about a year. They never disappoint, they only impress. TOP TEAM: TWICE  I saw \u201cHeartbreaker\" by accident while binging Blackpink and thought Twice was interesting so I looked them up and found their reality shows. After getting to know them, I really liked them. \u201cWhat Is Love\u201d sealed the deal and I was hooked ever since. Okay bye. ",

ITZY  I know they\u2019re rokies, but they already have their own sound & they\u2019re so talented <3. 3. (G)- IDLE  I really love everything abou them, I couldn\u2019t even decide on a bias (I was between Yuqi, Minnie & Soojin) because I love them so much, I reallyyyyyyyy want to meet them <3<3<3<3. 4. MAMAMOO  Ooof!!, they\u2019re so talented, I wish they were less underrated, they\u2019re vocals are out of this world. 5. BLACKPINK  They\u2019re only in number 5, because their performances need a little improvement, but I love everything else about them, their albums are always a bop. 6. EVERGLOW  They\u2019re as talented as they\u2019re beautiful, it took me so long to pick a bias, (i was between EU & Onda). 7. Red velvet  I love their concept and their visulas are so amazing :). 8. MOMOLAND  I love them so much, their vocals have to get a little better when they\u2019re dancing, but I know theit trying, I feel so bad for what happened to them in Mexico, I just want to say us Mexicans don\u2019t claim those people. 9. CLC  They\u2019re so talented and their song are bops. Boy Groups:1.BTS  They\u2019re my number one, these beatiful boys got me into kpop *sniff sniff*. I love them so much, they\u2019re so pure and talented, I love our fandom so much, it\u2019s full of sweet & supportive people, like a second family. 2.1TEAM  These boys make me feel some type of way 3<3<3<3. I\u2019ve been in love with them since their debut, talented and beautiful babies. ~I\u2019m sorry for not liking many boy groups ( you can tell I\u2019m a girl group stan:) ), you should give these groups a listen, they all deserve it~ See you later alligator -M ",

            "answer_text": "Ooh, pick me. I know exactly the group- it all comes down to taste but here we go. This group is a Woolim group- they are labelmates with Rocket Punch and Golden Child. All members are talented\u2026\u2026\u2026 They are Lovelyz!  I\u2019m not a full Lovelinus yet, but I can identify the members:(tell me if I made a mistake!!) Baby Soul(Soojung) is the one with the tan top, in front row. She is easy to recognize. Soojung likes to play piano.She is the leader of Lovelyz.Wonderful vocalcan rapHer ideal type is someone like Crush.See that one in the pretty pink top, the one beside Baby Soul? That\u2019s Kei, a main vocal. She released her solo albumSings a lot of OSTs.Very easy voice to recognize- good for new fans.also distinctive faceThe one in green top- Sujeong. lead vocalshares room with Baby Soul ( soojung and sujeong hehe)Beautiful voice, i\u2019m shook. She snapped in triangle.It was recently her birthdayThe other one with a tan top and red hair- she\u2019s Mijoo. She gets best of both worlds with names- She was born Mijoo and that became her stage name. But then she changed her real name to Seungah.Shares not being able to swim with her roommate Kei.Often has red hair, or brown hairGirl with red top is Jisoo! She can act.Shares a room with Jin.She enjoys shopping and listening to music.And I think that Jin is the one beside Soojung. Shares room with JisooVOCAL QUEEN AH MY HEARTShe wears braces even though she\u2019s like 24Jiae is the one beside Mijoo. Visualwas a modelShe enjoys dancing.The members say she sleepwalks. They also claim it\u2019s a little serious\u2026\u2026be preparedThat leaves Yein\u2026 Maknae.A member of Top Dogg said he had a crush on Yein.She used to be under JYP.Fun Facts: Baby Soul and Sujeong have the same real name, but I call Baby Soul Soojung and I call Sujeong, well, Sujeong.They have a few episodes on variety shows like Weekly Idol.Baby Soul doesn\u2019t always rap but when she does, she sounds good.All have great vocals, but I like Jin, Baby Soul, and Kei\u2019s voices best.Yein is often called a deer. (lol)They were on Queendom.Songs!: Lovelyz have great title tracks, such as Lost and Found and Beautiful Days. But their side tracks are mesmerizing too- they take a while to grow on you sometimes but are same quality as titles. My recommended songs:(not in order) DollAmusement ParkLost and FoundBeautiful DaysMoonlightJustCircleTRIANGLE. This song is a whole bop, it took a while to grow on me. I used to only like lost&found but then I loved this song. I played it too much(it\u2019s really addictive once you learn to like it)The (yes that\u2019s what it\u2019s called)TwinkleBookmarkAh-ChooA piece of the moon-that\u2019s Baby Soul\u2019s soloCameoTheir style is their own, most groups do girl crush(Blackpink, Twice, Crystal Clear, Itzy, Iz*One, Weki Meki.) Not dragging those groups but most do girl crush and it gets boring. But Lovelyz kind of has a girl crush concept, right? What sets them apart is: They don\u2019t over excessively use EDMTheir songs aren\u2019t flex songs about how many boyfriends they have or their 1000 million cars.They have a signature style.All of Lovelyz are talented. Stan Lovelyz!  ~Reena ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my top 4 in no particular order: MAMAMOO- When it comes to just pure talent, these four women are number one. They don\u2019t need flashy choreo or the typical Kpop girl group style to put on a great show. Just give these girls a microphone and a stage, and they\u2019ll blow you away. They write some of their own songs, choreograph the majority of their own dances, and I can\u2019t stress how heavenly their voices are. I wish more people would recognize their talent. They truly deserve so much more success. BigBang- I don\u2019t need to say much here. If you know Kpop then you know BigBang. They\u2019re the Kings. \u2018Nuff said. BTS- About 2\u20133 years ago I saw my first ever Kpop mv and these guys blew me away. My life hasn\u2019t been the same since. They give me so much hope and I learned how to dream again because of them. Their success didn\u2019t come as a surprise to me. It was only a matter of time before the whole world saw them like I did. And I hope that their popularity will bring more foreign artists into mainstream music. Loona- I honestly surprised myself when I turned into a Loona stan lmao. If I would\u2019ve heard \u201cHi High\u201d like a year ago, I wouldn\u2019t even think about listening to them (not because it\u2019s a bad song but it\u2019s so cutsie omfg). But their debut process was so unique and I got to see what each member is actually like, so I feel more invested in them. Plus although \u201cHi High\u201d is kinda cutsie, it\u2019s also a bop lol so I can\u2019t be mad. Plus they\u2019re literally all living memes so how could I not stan. I do look forward to their next comeback tho. Stan Loona BeLisMamamoo Love Yourself Let\u2019s meet again when the flowers bloom ",

            "answer_text": "If I\u2019m to be perfectly honest, Super Junior.  There\u2019s a few things that drew me to them, and I wanna rant about em, so yay you get that now. The first is the strength that these boys (men\u2026) have shown, even through everything. They\u2019ve been together 13 years, and are still fairly popular even after all members going through military. They\u2019ve helped each other through several car accidents, the loss of family members, scandals, marriages, and run ins with the law (coughkangincough) and come out of it stronger. They\u2019re hilarious, and don\u2019t care all that much about an \u201cimage\u201d, per say. They\u2019ll pay each other out at any opportunity (go watch Super TV or their episodes of Intimate Note, Knowing Brothers and Weekly Idol if you don\u2019t believe me). They\u2019ve gotten up on stage and shamelessly pulled off Elsa costumes (or in Heechul\u2019s case, Anna), Beyonce costumes, Lady GaGa, Sistar, Power Rangers, Avengers, you name it, they\u2019ve probably done it. And let\u2019s not forget Leeteuk\u2019s \u201cSexy Elsa\u201d and Eunhyuk\u2019s Marilyn Monroe (in the airport, mind you).   (and honestly, how pretty is Hyukkie here???) But even when they\u2019re not together, you can see them everywhere. Heechul is well known as one of the temporary hosts of Weekly Idol, and a permanent one in Knowing Brothers. Leeteuk hosts Star Show 360, among other things, and appears on so many others (I haven\u2019t seen them all yet\u2026). I know for a fact Shindong also does show hosting, but I don\u2019t recall where. Ryeowook (and Leeteuk) used to host Sukira (Super Junior Kiss The Radio) before he went to the military. They all have their points of appeal when doing these shows; Heechul\u2019s crazy temperament is well known to most Kpop fans. They\u2019re also doing so much good for this world. Siwon, in particular, aids a lot of different humanitarian groups and causes. I just got lucky on one of his recent Instagram posts; he posted a wonderfully touching speech about bullying, and responded to my comment\u2026 it\u2019s clear that even if it isn\u2019t his priority (which, honestly, it may be), be certainly wants to spread awareness, and that is something that means a lot to me, as the cause is close to my heart.  (and yes, it was an insane experience to be noticed, and my god am I thankful for it\u2026 it saved me that night\u2026 screenshot from Siwon\u2019s twitter; cause I couldn\u2019t get it all in one shot) There\u2019s also the subgroups and songs they have. D&E is doing so well right now, and I\u2019m so proud of them; if you watch those two through the years, they\u2019re actual friendship goals, being around the same age and their personalities complimenting each other so well. SuJu T was possibly one of my favourites, being the reason Rokkugo came about; the song is so fun and light, and also that TeukChul right there. (Also kinda jealous of Heechul\u2019s hairstyle).  And with SuJu you also have half a dozen solo artists. Chinese members Zhoumi and Henry are both active soloists, as are all three main vocals (Yesung, Ryeowook and Kyuhyun). There are some gorgeous titles within their discographies, with my favourites being Henry\u2019s Trap and Fantastic (as a violinist\u2026) and Ryeowook\u2019s The Little Prince.    But finally, I need to rant a little about my bias; leader and precious angel Leeteuk. Teuk has been so strong, so selfless over the years, and it\u2019s his thoughtful character (and good looks, not about to deny the good looks) that draw me to him. He\u2019s been through a lot. He stayed strong through Hangeng\u2019s lawsuits and Kibum\u2019s departure. He helped Donghae through his father\u2019s death, and Heechul through the proceeding car accident. He was the first to enter the military, and chose to go on active duty rather than a military police role. He suffered through the pain and grieving of his father\u2019s suicide, and his grandparent\u2019s murder, not to mention his fathers scathing last words and debt. He pulled Kangin through his DUI scandal, and is dealing with the second. He was caught in the car accident that nearly robbed Kyuhyun of his life and voice, and was badly injured, but told paramedics to go to Kyuhyun first; \u201che\u2019s worse than me\u201d (Shindong\u2019s reports later say that Teuk was bleeding very badly as well, though he\u2019s right, Kyuhyun was worse). He stood by Siwon during his scandal (something regarding his dog; I didn\u2019t pay a whole lot of attention to it). I don\u2019t doubt that he\u2019ll be standing by Sungmin with his wedding scandal (which shouldn\u2019t be a scandal honestly; boy fell in love, what\u2019s the big deal? He is like thirty something, it was about time anyway). Teuk is Super Junior\u2019s angel, and mine too. I hope that, maybe, as time goes on, things can be easier for him, and the rain in his life may let up, but for now I want to thank him for inspiring me. And that is why you should stan Super Junior xx ",

            "answer_text": "I saw Holly Tan answer this and I thought I\u2019d give it a go. It took me a minute to really decide my top three. I\u2019ve put myself into a ton of kpop fandoms and kpop isn\u2019t even my main music source. But I decided after some very careful thinking and I think I\u2019ll do a top 3 boy groups and top 3 girls groups. I don\u2019t hold boy and girl groups to the same standards because they are treated so in the kpop industry and if you\u2019ve been a long time fan like me, You understan what I mean. Boy groups first! Super Junior (SuJu)I couldn\u2019t for the life of me find a photo with all of them, but *shrug* They debuted in November of\u20262005 I think? They had more members than they currently do.  2. GOT7 I was going to add in one of the older groups I really loved, but I don\u2019t constantly listen to the same groups I did when I was younger. Got7 is probably the most played group on my Spotify. Their recent comeback Eclipse really spoke to my heart but I really liked this photo from the lullaby comeback.  3. ATEEZ Oky, so for my third group\u2026I really couldn\u2019t decide between Monsta X, Seventeen, or Ateez. Bur as of recent, I\u2019ve been listening to Ateez a ton. I\u2019m def an Atiny now and I\u2019m really looking forward to their comeback. I hope they get a lightstick soon.  Okay! Top 3 girl groups! TWICESo, I\u2019m not big into girl groups because of the whole generic bubblegum pop feel. But, as TWICE has gotten older, I\u2019ve liked their music a bit more. Currently, they are my number one girl group.  2. (G)I-dle I really really really love this group. They\u2019re a bit dif from my number one. I listened to Hann a few months ago and was immediately in love and listen to their other music. YG def missed out on having Miyeon in BlackPink but I feel that she fits this groups vibe a lot more.  3. Girls Generation (SNSD) I\u2019m fully aware they aren\u2019t really a group anymore, but I still love them a lot.  Sorry this was so long, I have a hard time deciding things. ~J ",

BTS   Ah yes, on of the first kpop groups I've got into. Now don't get me wrong I loveeee BTS will all my heart but I've been a fan for a while now ( kinda) and I'm starting to lose a little interest but I still love them and listen to all their music and I am an OT7 3. A.C.E   I love these boys also to death. I honestly couldn't chose who was my bias at first but now it is BK and my bias wrecker is WOW. So the same thing with ATEEZ I fell in that hole again with A.C.E (and I'm not mad haha) the first song I heard by them was \u2018take me higher\u2019 and I still listen to that song because it is just my favorite song (well one of them). So those were my top 3 BG and now onto GG ;) 3YE I just had to put them on my top 3 they have sooo much potential!! Just like with ATEEZ and A.C.E I fell in love with their consept and their music I just love it all haha 2. DREAMCATCHER   My girlllssssss. I honestly love them so much and they have such a fresh concept that I havent seen much in kpop. Just like 3YE they have alot of potential and I can see them being big one day and I hope that it happens ^^ 3. MAMAMOO    all I have to say about this group is VOCAL QUEEENSSS HONEY. They just have to be on my top 3 because I love them so much. They are a group of visuals. They have great talents. And stage presence is just 100%. Oh hey you made it to the bottom! Thank you so much for reading my top 3 BG and GG Bye bye~ ",

STRAY KIDS- they have a lot of talent and honestly, although I'm not a great fan of their music, they do try put out a good message in their music. Their stages are crazy though and the boys themselves are cute, handsome and very talented. Bias- Bang Chan Bias Wrecker- Lee Know 9. ASTRO- more to do with their talent and personalities rather than the actual music itself. members are very cute Bias- Moon bin Bias Wrecker- Eun Woo 8. EXO- Their songs aren\u2019t really my style but they do have talent. Sometimes I feel they lack something but I don\u2019t know what?? you get what I mean. All the guys really solid dudes and I wish Lay would join in their Korean promotions but man these boys do have talent. Their vocals are off the fucking chart. Bias- Sehun Bias Wrecker- Chanyeol/Baekhyun 7. TWICE- These girls have so much stage presence that it is mf crazy. some of their songs aren\u2019t my thing, and because of this they are quite low on the list but these girls CAN sing but they really need to go on a break ASAP. They are clearly tired Bias- Momo/Nayeon Bias Wrecker-Jeongyeon 6. RED VELVET- I don\u2019t know why but I have really gotten to like red velvet\u2019s music style and their live performances. They have a lot of talent and although stage presence lacks sometimes, they can prove someone wrong. Bias- Joy Bias Wrecker- Seulgi 5. TOMORROW X TOGETHER- they are cute and breath of fresh air in the Kpop industry. they defo know how to put on a good stage. Honestly ACTUAL ROOKIES OF THE YEAR (meaning they are a group without a member who has already debuted or entered the Kpop scene before) their first mini album was a bop so I look forward to their newer releases. Bias- Beomgyu Bias Wrecker- Yeonjun 4,3 +2 are acc all on the same level in my opinion but I did the order based on music style preference but in actuality I like them on the same scale 4. GOT7- first group I got into after BTS. Same with ASTRO prefer their talents and personalities more than their music. BUT they have some bangers and the JUS2 unit was actual heaven. Bias- Jaebum Bias Wrecker- Yugyeom 3. MONSTA X- their style is very different, hip hop r&b and also quite grime inspired. their powerful dance and visuals are what made me obsessed with them and also one of the only groups that have a strong rapline. Bias- Shownu Bias Wrecker- Kihyun/ Minhyuk 2. NCT (ALL UNITS INCL. WAYV).Honestly a talented bunch of young men, who are killing everyone with fresh stages and personalities. They are very visual heavy group meaning every single one is so beautiful ( but I mean who in the Kpop industry isn\u2019t beautiful). they have grown into a very professional group that Hoobaes can look up to. NCT DREAM Bias- Chenle Bias Wrecker- Jaemin NCT 127 Bias- Taeyong Bias Wrecker- Jaehyun/Doyoung WAYV Bias-Hendrey/ Ten Bias Wrecker-Lucas 1.BTS are my ultimate biases:))))))) First ever Kpop group and they continue to be the one group I completely anticipate. Their lyrics remain the same, meaningful message they always portray and their style is fresh and different. they are not afraid of changing things up and if they have a setback, they learn from it. They have crawled through mud and water to get to where they are and honestly I don\u2019t see them leaving anytime soon. The way Big Bang seems right now, I honestly believe that BTS have earned themselves the crown to be one of the Kings of KPOP. ALSO, I recommend BANGTAN UNIVERSE to be something you should check out because once you go there, you never come back bitch. Bias- Jungkook Bias Wrecker- the rest of BTS;)) ",

            "answer_text": "BTS- I\u2019ve been a fan since Dope Era (2015). What BTS has that made me love them is their meaningful lyrics. It talks about society and society\u2019s problem which is a taboo in Korea, brave for a group that came from a small company. Also their bond, they\u2019re more than just a group, they are a family. Favorite Songs: 1!2!, Spring Day, Young Forever. Bias: Kim SeokjinStray Kids- I\u2019ve become a fan later last year. Bts and they have in common, they do write and produces their own songs. They also have meaningful lyrics. Waaahh, I just love them. Favorite Songs: Insomnia and Grow Up. Bias: Yang JeonginSeventeen- I\u2019ve become a fan 1 month after they\u2019ve debuted. Self- sufficient idols same with my first two. Writes and produces their own songs. Favorite Songs: Thanks and Our dawn is hotter than day. Bias: Wen Junhui and Lee SeokminIkon- I\u2019m still knowing them. Favorite Songs so far: Best Friend and Goodbye Road. Bias: Jinhwan catches my eyeTXT- Bts\u2019 hoobaes. They\u2019re actually talented, to tell you the truth, their vocals were much stronger than of BTS. Favorite Song: Blue Orangeade Bias: All of them, lolWinner- these four guys probably the most I can say that is real singers, no offense meant to other kpop groups. May it be like, they\u2019re a bit drunk, they can slay their songs. Really Really live version and Everyday tipsy version was really amazing. Blessed YG, they have found these guys.That would be all for now, I don\u2019t know but I can\u2019t really explain why I do love them, I just do. ",

I also believe theyre the most meme group in kpop lolol. I am Hyunjin biased (also OT9) The song \u201cHellevator\u201d is what got me into them and then I listened to \u201cDistrict 9\u201d, \u201cGet Cool\u201d, and \u201cSide Effects\u201d and I got really hooked. Usually, it takes me a while to learn a group, but skz had such distinct personalities that it was really easy to learn them and enjoyable too. \u2022 TXT (Tomorrow x Together)  The group started out as a \u2018privileged\u2019 group and \u2018only popular bc of BTS' but then really proved themselves (music wise) with TDC:Magic, which really showcased their talents well. Their personalities are just adorable and they are so funny and cute. They love their fans and their senior group, BTS. Im not an ARMY myself but the interaction between the two groups is just amazing and TXT looks up to them so much that its so adorable. BTS are their biggest supporters and vise versa. I am OT5 and absolutely can not pick a bias for the life of me lolol. \u2022 NCT / WayV  I havent been an Nctzen for very long and am still learning some members, but this group's concepts and members are just amazing. My friend introduced me to their music and I absolutely fell in love. A few months later, I had finally decided to stan them with his help. I am OT21 but the members I am most biased to are Taeyong, Jungwoo, and Johnny. ",

I have not been a k-pop lover for so much time but I have learned to love 2 bands with all my heart:>BTS   I love them with everything, their attempts of being hotter than the sun, every little defect, every stupid thing they do, and all of their weird faces.  Their songs just make me feel so good, so loved, like I worth a lot more than I think (21st Century girl)  I don\u2019t know what my life would be if I hadn\u2019t met them.  >GOT7 I don\u2019t know why but my heart just starts beating more ando more when I see them, and then when I their videos I never notice I\u2019m always smiling.  I fell in love with them for their love between them, they ara like a family composed by brothers  They are dumb, just like BTS members just that they take stupidness to the next level, I laugh every day with them.  JACKSON!!! That piece of clown is a ball of memes and craziness   Their music may not have the greatest beat but their lyrics (ooofff) its obvious that will touch your heart.  These are my favorite bands, I have laughed with them   I\u2019ve cried and felt their sadness   I\u2019ve seen them succesing   And I\u2019m proud of being their fan.  Sorry if this was too long, but it was because of the pictures, so these are my 2 fav. k-pop boy bands. Hope you like them too, and if you don\u2019t know them\u2026.. LISTEN TO THEIR SONGS RIGHT AWAY\u2026. maybe you\u2019ll fall in love too. <3 ok, there are a lot more bands I love, but these are those that have most impacted me, and my life. ",

            "answer_text": "BTS is obviously number one for me, the amount of effort they put into writing song lyrics and composing for their fans. The dances they do are perfect, the music videos are to die for, everything they have done for us ARMY\u2019s is absolutely beautiful. They love their fans with all their hearts, and have been on the edge of disbanding but have stayed strong till the end. BTS are also a bunch of crackheads, just watching those videos of them is definitely what will make me crack a smile and laugh. They spread their message \u2018Love Yourself\u2019 constantly for those who deal with hardships, that\u2019s why they will always be my number one favourite. I Purple You BTS!! Ateez i only just got into them so don\u2019t kill me haha, but i love the beat and their dance with their songs. they are crackheads which i found hilarious, they are big BTS fans which i thought was kinda cute. stray kids another not so newly debuted band who\u2019s music and dance is absolutely stunning!! i love to listen to their music and watch their MV\u2019s ahem STREAM MIROH. TXT also known as tomorrow x together. this newly debuted group has gotten a lot of attention for being the brother group of BTS. i didn\u2019t like them at first but after actually listening to their music, i started liking them a lot more and i like how unlike BTS they have a more poppy sound to their music which is a change definitely. BlackPink i\u2019m more of a fan of boy bands, but black pink manages to squeeze their way into my answer. although i find it sad they only ever make 4 new songs per album plus the amount of fan wars between blackpink and bts is ridiculous. Jennie when she dated someone which was against her contract should\u2019ve gotten fired as she broke a contract that she signed and agreed to. the fact that YG treats her like a princess kind of annoys me because the other members are just as good. i have to be honest, if i didn\u2019t chose blackpink it would be wannaone or got7. dont hate me, this is just my opinion. we all have opinions and you may not agree with mine but so what. anyways have a good day byee~!

            "answer_text": "I like, and love, a lot of groups, so I\u2019m going to list some that especially stand out to me. I\u2019ll break them down into two categories - the ones I like and love. I\u2019ll also give brief explanations as to how they stole my heart. Here they are: LIKEFromis_9 The first song I heard from them was \u201cLove Bomb\u201d, and it was the best thing that happened to me the entire month. I was hooked to that song. The chorus gave me these \u201csad but happy\u201d vibes, and I thought it was very unique and creative. I began to search them up and listen to more of their songs. Some of them I like, others are just not my style.Momoland If you guessed I discovered them through \u201cBboom Bboom\u201d, then you\u2019re right. 7th-grade me religiously listened to it every. single. day. No matter how much hate they get, I will still continue to enjoy their music and respect the members.ONEUS Some of their songs don\u2019t really appeal to me, but I love \u201cCome Back Home\u201d and \u201cLit\u201d. I haven\u2019t heard much of \u201cTo Be or Not To Be\u201d to really give a statement about the song; nevertheless, I\u2019m curious about what types of music they\u2019ll release in the future.Victon They\u2019re really underrated, but their songs are top-tier. Some are even better than certain title tracks released by top groups. They also have a lot of talent, and I think that should never be ignored.Seventeen I\u2019ve never seen any other Kpop group release the type of music they make. Their vocalists sing with overflowing emotion, and that\u2019s what caught my eye (or ears) the most along with their unique discography.Red Velvet Do I even need to explain? They are IT, and nobody else can do it like they do. Their songs deserve all the awards, wins, and support they got. In my opinion, they have the one of the best vocal line-ups in their generation.LOVEDreamcatcher I can write a whole essay about this group. They are SO underrated, yet their discography is one of the best, if not the BEST, I\u2019ve stumbled upon in this generation of Kpop. They have NO bad songs AT ALL in my opinion, and the albums keep getting better each comeback. Not only do they have great songs, but their personalities are amazing. They have superb chemistry and are really funny, cute, kind, and caring. I watched the following video titled \u201c[Guide] Dreamcatcher \ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0- Collecting Hearts Of Other Idols (Elris Gugudan KARD Everglow Izone Etc)\u201d yesterday, and I find it to be one of the most wholesome and entertaining videos I\u2019ve seen in weeks. Link: Loona \u201cButterfly\u201d took my breath away. It was the first ever song I heard from them, and I\u2019ve stanned them ever since. The more I discover facts about them and listen to their music, the more I love and cherish them. They\u2019re also one of a few idols who openly support the LGBT+ community, of which I am a part of. I felt a sense of \u201cpride\u201d (pun intended?) when I learned that; furthermore, their songs are among the best I\u2019ve listened to, and I never get tired of them. STAN LOONA.I apologize if reading this gave you a headache. My English has been getting worse each year ;-; ",

            "answer_text": "Let's go like this My top 5 favorite groups are 5. Seventeen I always loved their performances. SVT was a very first group with so many members I started to stan and I felt for their teamwork and their music quality. These days I can't say I'm a fan of new stuff but I still love them so much.  Bias: S. Coups Overall I'm hip-hop unit biased but the leader was and still is my soft spot I love him so much. He is there for boys 24/7. Also, I\u2019m IN LOVE with his eyes.  4.Stray Kids I heard them this year (I actually didn't watch that reality they had) and I fall on my butt the moment District 9 started (also the leader is celebrating his birthday today by KST -Happy Birthday Chris!). Hip Hop bands are my thing and it was natural for me to fall in love with their style right away. Stray Kids are young but their topics are so real. The fact that young boys can write and produce their own music makes me so proud.  Bias: Hyunjin I LOVE HIM. TBH Felix is also pretty much my bias but Hyunjin is the most fascinating member of Stray Kids. A rapper with the title of visual I didn't expect him to actually be an amazing rapper but his rap is...out of this world he is co clean and fast plus amazing dancer plus fantastic vocalist. Very affectionate and loving toward members (baby Pisces )...he is perfect.  3. GOT7 Got7 does not have the best music in this world or best rappers but they are the best fit you can find. The energy of the group is so big and large that you can't dislike them. Even when JB or Jinyoung try to act seriously you know they will fail because they are same savage kids as the other 5. I LOVE their humor and I love them as a band.  Bias: Yugyeom YG is my ult bias. I LOVE THAT BOY. Back in the day when I heard \"If You Do\" Thai baby boy was my bias but after \"Never Ever\" I got interested in sexy tall makane. So naturally, I spent hours watching and re-watching \"Hit The Stage\" as well as his savage videos. He is a big baby and also a very talented one. I love him.  2.NCT More I got into them more I like them. At last SM got good quality hip-hop band whit actually good rappers! Music style changes and my favorite songs are usually tracks with fewer members like \"Yestoday\" but overall there isn't song i don't like (some Dream songs are not my style but it's OK), they are amazing!  Bias: Taeyong I don't like being clich\u00e9 but every time I see him I forget that the rest of the world exists. He is a fascinating idol, sweet boy yet powerful on stage. Boy with so many talents (please even his singing voice is magical) I adore him  1. BTS My boys. My heart. All those bands are great but joy and happiness BTS brings into my life is something different. BTS came into my life and ever since then their music is there for me when I'm happy or sad or when I need to feel loved. Those 7 boys are special and I love them so much.  Bias: Yoongi I never had such a huge respect for someone like I do for him. Yoongi is my second ult and he is my bias since I became ARMY basically (Jimin was first week or two). I don't understand Korean but I feel when he raps. His nature is also fascinating and I remember crying my heart out when I read that he had to choose between a meal or bus. He deserves the world.

            "answer_text": "BTS I was properly introduced into K-pop through BTS, and they still remain as my favourite group out of all the groups I stan. I love the fact that they can slay any concept thrown their way. Unlike many other groups, the members seem to be very genuine and they are all so close as if they are one big family. So they left a good impression on me both personality wise and music wise.   EXO They\u2019re the group I got into right after BTS. The weird or rather unusual thing about me stanning EXO is that I fell for the members first, and then their music followed. EXO\u2019s music was pretty different to BTS's and I loved the contrast. It felt refreshing and new.   These groups have always been my top 2 and I actively follow them. Although I consider myself a multi, I do not follow other groups as much as I follow these two, which is why it's hard to pick one for the final spot. Some of the groups I love listening to are MONSTA X, GOT7, PENTAGON, NCT, Stray Kids, MAMAMOO, TXT, X1 & ATEEZ. If I really had to choose one as my 3rd favourite, I'd probably go with:  MONSTA X It was \u2018Shoot out\u2019 which got me hooked. I freaking loved their last 2 comebacks as well. \u2018Alligator\u2019 was such a bop, that even the Jap version sounded just as good as the Korean one. \u2018Follow\u2019 was a great song too. When it comes English songs, they release the best ones. You must listen to \u2018Who do you love?\u2019, \u2018LOVE U\u2019 and \u2018Play it Cool\u2019.  (Miss you Wonho! T_T) ",

            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER: I mentioned that I do not like some of the members in certain groups. I won\u2019t be including specifics in my answer. I will also be over looking their scandals, and do not support what certain groups have done. Just want to make that clear. 10 > RED VELVET I found them around Dumb Dumb era and immediately stanned. Rookie is my ultimate fav song of theirs ever since it was released. Lots of people don't like it but.. its a whole ass bop. I just hope SM is a bit more fair towards them. They deserve it.  9 > PRISTIN .......... i............ ................. FUCK YOU PLEDIS  8 > CLC At first i didn't like them, but I somehow grew to like them. I do not like all of the members, and dont really watch when they go to variety shows for that very reason, but they absolutely deserve a spot on this list. As much as I loved Where are You i didnt really get why cube suddenly switched their concept? They wouldve been much more popular now. Their recent music is somehow a bit too similiar (Not including Devil) but its all so catchy and I hope these girls get the treatment they deserve.  7 > LOONA Orbits might be quite annoying, but I can see why they want people to stan them, as I am an orbit myself. I would put them higher on this list, but I feel like i'm losing interest in them recently (As a group, but I love them more individually? idk how to explain it). Their concept is unique. At first, when I first found LOONA, which was when VIVID was released, I didnt really understand whats going on yet, but the story and my understanding progressed with each solo. These girls deserve much more and especially EQUAL LINE DISTRIBUTIONS.  6 > WJSN I wasnt really interested in them until I saw this one video of them doing an underwater photoshoot, and SeolA over-coming her fear of water (Although the staff are clowns for forcing her). This video got me into them, after I saw how beautiful and nice all of the members are, so I looked into their music. It might not be everyone's taste, but definitely worth a shot. At first its quite intimidating to start stanning such a large groups, but it was very very easy to remember their names.  5 > TWICE This doesn't even need an explanation. Stan TWICE. I don't like all of the members, but thats only natural. Truly the 2nd nations girl group along with SNSD.  4 > (G)I-DLE Although I do not like all the members, I love LOVE their music and quite like the other 4 members. Senorita is my favorite song of theirs, evem though its kinda unpopular. Although I don't really like any of their personalities that much, I always find myself looking towards their next song to see what theyve come up with. Their music makes me over see what I don't like about them, which is very rare for me for that to happen-  3 > EXID If you don't have at least 1 song of theirs on ur playlist, ur committing a crime- All of their music is so catchy I find myself repeating it several times before I move on to the next song. Their choreo is simple yet still fits the concepts, making it easily memorable and fun to do. Hot pink is def my favorite. Stan EXID y'all.  2 > MAMAMOO These 4 girls, women rather, have such bright personalities and they are all so unique as people, but also with their music. I can't describe it but they have this certain style that theyve kept for all their career and its what draws me to them. I found them around mid 2016 and stanned them ever since.  1 > AOA They might not be my ults now, but still stand on top of this list. They were the first kpop artists I really stanned, which was late 2015, and the first kpop album and the only one I have till this day. I'll get some new ones soon, and AOA will sure be included. All of their music is amazing, and to me, never gets old. I love them all so much and really miss ChoA and Mina. I hope they continue to grow, and hopefully stay together.  ",

            "answer_text": "YES YES YES YES YES I LOVE KPOP WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND SOULLLLLLL!!!!! *cough* anyway! I love a lot of groups. Let\u2019s do it in order. Here\u2019s my top 6 (I was gonna do a top five but then I forgot to do BLACKPINK): 6. BTS  BTS is such a fun group! To me, they are literally the kings of K-Pop. They have a HUGE worldwide fan base and are just so popular. I think they\u2019re all adorable in their own way. Especially Kookie and his bunny smile. Aww\u2026 BUT- they\u2019re bloody cocky. Yes, alright, alright. We know you\u2019re the almighty, we know you\u2019re the kings of K-pop. But seriously, calmmmm downnnnnnnnn. Be humble. Be modest. Yes. My favorite song is \u201cRise of Bangtan\u201d which is super duper cocky but bloody hell- it\u2019s good!!!!! My bias is Suga! 5. Red Velvet  Red Velvet\u2019s songs are sooooooo cuteeeee! I don\u2019t stan them as much as I do other groups (and yes, I do stan BTS a lot, but they\u2019re still not my favorites). They\u2019re the typical girly girls at sometimes and then at other times they look edgy af. I still love their songssssss!! My favorite song of their\u2019s is Rookie. Owahhhh!!!! My bias is Irenenenenene! 4. Monsta X  Hyungwon is an actual meme. He\u2019s a precious blubba bubba and I love him so FUCKING MUCHHHH!!!! Anywayyyyy- They\u2019re such a unique group and their bond is unbelievably strong. They\u2019re all so funny and talented! And yes, Hyungwon\u2019s lips are real. I love them just as much as I love BLACKPINK, but I put them 4th because I can\u2019t have two groups in one category. My favourite song is Stuck. So gooooood! Hyungwon is obviously my bias, I love him too much! 3.  Lisssssaaaaaa!!!! I\u2019m sorry but this is one of the most amazing groups ever! Their songs, their dances, their voices, their looks- everything is perfect! Their V lives are so entertaining and funny. This group is adorable and edgy at the same time. They\u2019re such good role models and they always make me feel better about myself- I don\u2019t know why aha. My favourite song is DDU-DU DDU-DU- amazing. Lisa is my bias in BLACKPINK, my Thai cutie! 2. Wanna One  \u261d\ufe0e Me when I found out Guanlin was 16 years old. Aha\u2026 Anywayyyyyy- Wanna One, akkkk- beautiful!! I loved watching produce 101 and watching them grow. They\u2019re all incredibly talented, beautiful and funny! There\u2019s nothing bad to say about them!! My favourite song of theirs- akkk so many! Okay, \u2018Light\u2019, \u201cWanna be (my baby)\u201d and \u201c11 (eleven\u201d. Literally the best songs everrrr!! Gualin is mah bias! And finally, last but DEFINITELY not least. This group gives me life, this group makes me feel loved. They started my love for K-POP, I\u2019ve been there since their debut in 2015 (but back then I didn\u2019t know about the k-pop genre) This group is called- SEVENTEEN Bloody hellllllll I don\u2019t even know where to start. I love them so much to the extent that my love for them is unhealthy. I can\u2019t express my love- I just AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! They are perfect in every way possible. They\u2019re unbelievably talented (obviously), they\u2019re all memes (even though there\u2019s not as many memes of them as there is of bigger groups like BTS), they\u2019re all fucking gorgeous and they\u2019re all super funny and kind. Their V lives are hilarious and super entertaining! I love their instagrams and I love how Joshua always says \u201cHappy Saturday\u2600\ufe0f\u201d and \u201c#Letsgetit\u201d. It\u2019s the little things that count. My favourite song is all of them, but I can\u2019t choose all of them, so I\u2019ll choose three: \u201cLilili Yabbay\u201d (I think that\u2019s how you spell it), \u201cSpace\u201d and \u201cTrauma\u201d and \u201cSAY YES\u201d and \u201cShinning Diamond\u201d and- ALL OF THEM!!! I have an obsession, I know. My top Bias is Joshua freaking Hong, I love him more than anything (not in a romantic way). But when there\u2019s 13 perfect men, how can you have just one bias? JoshuaVernonHoshiSeungkwanJunJeonghanBONUS ROUND! Solo artists Here\u2019s my top three solo artists: 3. Stella Jang  I don\u2019t know much about her but in interviews she seems kind and funny. One of her songs is in my top 10 songs of all time- it\u2019s so goood!!! My favourite song is \u201cDo you know me?\u201d Super SUPER gooood!!!!! 2. Ailee  I just think she\u2019s so adorable and precious and beautiful and perfect and lovely and funny and kind and- Jesus. I love her songs so muchhhhh!!! I have two favourite songs: Q&A ft SEVENTEEN and U&I\u2026 Jesus they\u2019re stunning. DEAN Isn\u2019t he beautiful? Listening to DEAN is like listening to ASMR. His voice is like an angel! I love him so freaking much! He is just so funny but then again he\u2019s fucking edgy at some times (*cough* instagram music video). My favourite songs are \u201cInstagram\u201d and \u201cLove\u201d I hope this helped you! I highly recommend these groups and solo artists. I love them alllll!!! Have fun K-Popping, you won\u2019t regret it ;)! ",

            "answer_text": "BTS was my first kpop group and they\u2019re pretty up there but there are two groups above them. Topp Dogg (#1) They\u2019re a very talented, VERY underrated, unappreciated group. Their songs are so so original and the members are hilariously unique. I\u2019ve never seen such an animated, talented self producing group like them. They debuted in 2013 and have no one has ever given them much attention aside from their 2015 song \u201cThe Beat\u201d. Their company, HUNUS, practically ignores them and manages them terribly. They\u2019ve gone through around 20 member changes (including sub groups) and their career has been overall exhausting for them. They\u2019ve been on countless hiatuses and no one even knows if they\u2019ll have a comeback again or if some members are still there. They deserve so so much better and I love them with all my heart. Pentagon (#2) They\u2019re a fairly new group, only debuting in October 2016, but they are already so talented and making waves in the industry. Their leader, Hui, is becoming a very sought after and highly acclaimed composer. Hui and member E\u2019Dawn debuted in a group with Hyuna call Triple H. Wooseok and E\u2019Dawn are features on Hyuna\u2019s upcoming album. Jinho used to be in SM Ballad and Hongseok almost debuted with iKON on Mix & Match. They all participated in Pentagon Maker and they are honestly so talented and deserving of good comebacks, wins, and recognition. I love them a lot and their personalities are just so hard to not fall in love with. ",

            "answer_text": "BTS is my favorite Kpop group for many reason. I love them because of their passion and love for music. They are a group of very dedicated men. They\u2019ve had to struggle to the top. They\u2019ve also had to face many obstacles along the way, however, they all decided to push through it and keep going. It\u2019s becuase of this that they have a genuine bond. They are one of the few groups out there to participate in writing, composing, and producing their own music. Which is very admirable. BTS actually write their own lyrics. Each of the rappers even have their own mixtape. (RM, Agust D, Hope World, Mono) Also Suga is one the fastest rappers in the industry. Listen to Cypher pt 2 and you\u2019ll see. RM likes to do a lot of wordplay and such in some songs. In Ddaeng, RM mocks other rappers that stutters by incorporating stutters into his part of the song which is clever. BTS even practice their dancing up to 12 hours a day. Especially those who aren\u2019t a part of the dance line. Whats also admirable about them is the fact that they are very humble and accepting. BTS are known to be supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. In the speech that they gave at the United Nations ceremony, RM said \u201cno matter who you are, where you\u2019re from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself\u201d. They love to inspire us and give us encouraging messages. There are also times where they forget that they are celebrities. (For example, when one of the members tried on a unique pair of sunglasses he responded with \u201cwow I feel like a celebrity\u201d) They also get very excited they\u2019re versing each other in games for prizes such as a Nintendo switch or a rice cooker even though they\u2019re are millionaires lol. BTS also breaks social norms. One of the rappers (Suga) ends up making some songs about struggling with depression and social anxiety. This is amazing because talking about mental illness is considered a taboo in South Korea. Some people don\u2019t even like to associate BTS with Kpop anymore because of how diverse their music is. They do many genres such as pop, hip hop, ballads, EDM, and even Latin pop! They love to experiment and change it up every time. Also BTS has a storyline with their music videos and clips. Fans love making theories based off of their music videos and clips. Each member has a unique story and people love to figure it out. They also don\u2019t create simple concepts that every other group does. With their recent concept photos, it was a very weird yet interesting style. Members were put into boxes while there were hands, eyes, and cameras sticking into the boxes. Many fans theorized that it could\u2019ve been a metaphor for how they feel while being mobbed at airports. This turned out to be longer than I thought, but I hope you took the time to read it. Basically BTS is not like other Kpop groups and seriously deserves a chance to be heard and not to be stereotyped as \u201canother boy group\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, it\u2019s the band that introduced me to k-pop - Super Junior. Super JuniorSuper Junior is that ULTIMATE group for me that has my bias, my favorite songs, my favorite singers, my favorite dancers, and everything. Moreover, they are very entertaining. I became a fan of them because of their music and became a part of their fandom because of how funny they are. At first glance, they look like these sophisticated men in suits but are a group of comedians. they are funny. And while being so, they have one of the best singers of pop, one of the man dancers of kpop, one of the best leaders of kpop, one of the best hosts of tv shows and so on. 2. BlackPink I saw Jisoo and she was gorgeous and wanted to know more about her. That\u2019s how I found BlackPink and was totally blown away by their songs. Kpop usually has this concept of cute girl groups. They are nice songs but I was looking for that vibe that gives me an electrifying feeling. BlackPink gave me that. They are very talented. Jennie is one of the best rappers of this generation. Lisa is an amazing dancer. Rose and Jisoo are great singers. They are the best girl group in my opinion. 3. G-(I)DLE The most versatile group of this generation. They have covered several concepts. LATATA, then Uh-Oh, Senorita, and all their songs are very good and very different from each other. It\u2019s all in one. They are good at entertaining too. Yuqi is my favorite. She is super cute. Then we have the pretty Miyeon. I like Minnie. She is beautiful. Their rapper, Soyeon is also one of the best of new generation. 4. BTS Now I\u2019m not a huge fan of rap but kpop has a knack of making me a fan of those songs too because of their quality music. Blood, Sweat and Tears has to be one of the best songs of kpop this decade. In my opinion, it is the best song of this decade. If only the choreography was easier, I bet everyone would be dancing to it like Sorry Sorry. Then have songs like Idol and Boy With Luv and they also have songs like I Need U and Fake Love. If I weigh these songs, it\u2019s all balanced. Only BTS can do it. 5. SNSD Second generation SM idols were true gems. they were so talented. With their hard work, these groups had the best dances and singers. The company didn\u2019t give them much freedom but they still were able to show whatever they could. Taeyeon is one of the best female singers in kpop. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any argument in that. Hyoyeon is one of the best dancers. Let\u2019s not forget the beauty of Yoona, Yuri, and Seohyun. Their songs were mostly cute but Girl\u2019s Generation could still make you feel the heat. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a small group here on Quora! But of course there are some of us\u2026 It seems like there\u2019s no place on the internet without at least a few kpop fans these days! ^^ I\u2019ll just head straight into listing my faves, and I\u2019ll try to keep it short, k? In no particular order: 1- Block B  I really enjoy the kind of music they release. Usually I love every single song off their albums (which is kinda rare for me, I tend to skip ballads even from my faves). Woo Jiho is an incredible musician and producer! And while I\u2019ve been a fan of the group since Nillili Mambo in 2012, the struggle they went through with their lawsuit [Block B - Wikipedia] made me an even bigger fan. I respect them for publicly calling out Stardom Ent\u2019s horrible treatment of them because it\u2019s all too common in the kpop industry, but few idols will risk the public\u2019s judgement of them in such a situation. I also love the fact that they stuck together as 7, although it would certainly have been easier (for certain members) to ditch the group and try their luck as soloists. They must be good friends, to be so loyal to each other. And it paid off! 2- Mamamoo  Their vocals are amazing, they\u2019re without question some of the most talented people in the \u201cidol\u201d category right now. They\u2019re a lot of fun to watch on stage because they have a level of confidence and intimacy with the audience that I\u2019ve honestly never seen in kpop before. I like the fact that they\u2019re so close as friends too, Wheein and Hwasa have known each other since they were little kids together and it\u2019s just adorable to think that they\u2019re fulfilling their dream of becoming entertainers together as adults. They also have a sort of reputation for being LGBT friendly as idols and as people, and that appeals to me. 3- Stellar  I love Stellar because they have never given up. They\u2019re not at all popular in Korea (except with army men) and they\u2019re constantly criticized for their \u201coverly sexy\u201d image and songs. Leaving aside the \u201ctoo sexy\u201d debate (because that\u2019s a matter of opinion and preference) the fact that these girls have continued to try to reach out to new fans and make new music is really admirable. They\u2019ve told stories about being so broke as a group that they share one dinner between all four of them, and of being so unpopular that when a more popular girl group walks by at a performance or salon, they\u2019d hide out of shame. They\u2019ve come to the brink of disbandment several times, but their luck is turning a little lately. There\u2019s a company called Makestar that basically connects less well known kpop idols with international fans in a fundraising effort. Stellar\u2019s fans (myself included) crowdfunded their last two albums to over 400% of the goal! Now they can keep making music and trying new things to appeal to the public, without being forced to live like paupers. Well that ended up not being short at all, so I\u2019ll stop here. There are a lot more groups I\u2019m following though. Thanks for the A2A! Hopefully it\u2019s not considered spam if I include a link to my blog? In case anyone reading wants to find more kpop groups or chat with me!~ PINK&FUNKY ",

            "answer_text": "My favourite kpop groups? Oh boy get ready for a long answer My top 3 boy groups:  Seventeen: would have to be my ult group. I don\u2019t remember how I discovered them but I remember the first music video I watched was \u201cAju Nice\u201d followed by \u201cDon\u2019t Wanna Cry\u201dat the end of 2017. My first thought was \u201cwhy the hell are they\u2019re so many of them?!\u201d What I love abt Seventeen the most is their synchronisation while dancing, not one of them is just average. I also love how there are three sub-units catered for each member who specialise in a specific area (performance, vocal and hip-hop). I specifically want to mention the three leaders of the sub-groups. S.coups shows how hardworking he is by leading all 12 members as well as being the leader for the hip-hop unit. I don\u2019t know how he does it, but Hoshi is able to choreograph a lot of the group\u2019s dances, which is beyond my talent. He is also able to sing and rap just as well. Lastly, Woozi deserves continuous praise for producing almost all of Seventeen\u2019s songs. He literally has me wondering sometimes how he has that much talent, the fact that his artistic control creates such catchy and meaningful songs which are completed by the other members. NCT: is just a whole ass group full of visuals and talent. I really appreciate the diversity in the group (international fans can relate) and although I think the \u2018limitless\u2019 member concept is uneccessary, I still think it\u2019s unique. They provide lots of fanservice which makes them easy to follow, not to mention their songs are weird as fuck, which what makes them interesting. The member I appreciate the most is Mark. He is able to be in all 3 units of NCT, remember ALL of their choreography and write his own raps at the age of 19. DON\u2019T GET ME STARTED ON THEIR DANCING, TEN AND JISUNG WHAT THE FUCK. I also think that Taeil\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t appreciated enough. They\u2019re just a bunch of crackheads who really know how to sing, rap and dance. (MFAL IS THE SUPERIOR SONG). BTS: were the first group that introduced me to K-pop back in 2017 with their song \u201cDope\u201d. Probably one of the most inpirising groups in terms of musical creativity. They delve into topics that are taboo and aren\u2019t ones you would think about, they even encouraged me to paint an artwork based off the lyrics in \u201cBaepsae\u201d and \u201cGo Go.\u201d In my opinion they have one of the strongest rap-lines with RM, Suga and J-hope. Although they are not my ult group anymore, they are one of the most inspiring and will always have a place in my heart as being my first K-pop group discovery.Top 2 Girl Groups:  Red Velvet: are my ult girl group. Their name is evidence of their ability to switch from sweet bubblegum-pop to seductive \u2018velvet\u2019 concepts. Wendy\u2019s voice can switch from strong and powerful to sweet and sultry. They also cater to r&b based tracks, which I am a huge fan of (I JUST AND KINGDOM COME CAN LIKE, GET IT). To people who think that Yeri was not a worthy addition to the group, she might\u2019ve not been the best when she debuted but has definitely improved since then and has proved that her vocal and dancing skills are worthy. Mamamoo: are a close second. I first saw their performance in the 2018 Seoul Music Awards and decided to watch their \u201cYes I Am\u201d music video. It\u2019s one of my favorite songs because it promotes self-acceptance and confidence, and defies Korean beauty standards. I personally think that Moonbyul is one of the best female rappers with her low register and nice flow. Solar is also notable for her extremely strong vocals. I love their fun songs the most because they are all able to execute strong stage presence.Honorable Mentions: DeanKim ChunghaStray KidsPentagonEXOHyuna",

            "answer_text": "SEVENTEEN I am a huge fan of SEVENTEEN. I have been following them since their predebut era, way before some of the members even joined the group. I have been a Kpop fan since 2008 and have liked several groups in the past, but once I found SEVENTEEN, my entire outlook of Kpop changed. I will list some of the reasons for why I like them so much. SELF-PRODUCING IDOLS. Some people think SVT uses the \u201cself-producing idols\u201d tag because it\u2019s trendy. But very few know that the title itself was coined by the Korean media to describe SVT. Although a few groups had been making their own songs before SVT debuted, SVT was a self-producing group in the truest sense, because they wrote, composed, and choreographed their own stuff. This was all because the company wasn\u2019t in the position to provide in-house songwriters, producers (except for Bumzu), and choreographers (they have a dance instructor named Hyelim). Woozi learned to compose songs on GarageBand. As of today, all members have songwriting credits on KOMCA, with Woozi having nearly 80 songs under his belt, followed by Vernon with over 55 songs. They even designed their own mascot and promoted themselves to the public to make their debut happen.They made their debut happen. This might seem odd, but it was actually the members who took it upon themselves to debut. They had been waiting for their debut for years, but their company kept pushing it, because the company has serious management issues. They promoted themselves by doing street performances, performed in schools and hospitals for free, in order to gain some attention.They\u2019re a classic example of rags-to-riches. Back in 2015, when they debuted, Pledis was not in a good position, financially. All 13 boys were crammed in a small dorm, and their living conditions were so poor that they even had to fight for toothpaste and other basic necessities! Some members even came on the verge of leaving because their future looked blurry with an uncertain debut and the company\u2019s lack of proper management. Even after debut, it wasn\u2019t easy for SVT. You might know that artists who perform on stage require in-ear monitors. However, since those are very expensive and the company could not afford them, they had to use regular earphones. Since those aren\u2019t suitable, the members had to borrow money from their parents to buy in-ears. However, they saw a silver lining when they became the best-selling rookie group that year and was the only kpop group to be listed in Billboard\u2019s \u201c21 Under 21 2015: Music's Hottest Young Stars\u201d and their rookie album appeared on Billboard\u2019s \"10 Best K-pop Albums of 2015\" chart. They broke even in 2016, and soon established their company\u2019s status as one of the top entertainment companies. Right now, they are one of the Top 3 best selling kpop boy groups in 2019.SVT is quite different from your everyday Kpop groups. Back then, grungy, bad-boy concepts were more popular. SVT popularized fresh, funky concepts and developed their music over the years.They write meaningful songs. This is one of the lesser-known things about them, but SVT writes very well-thought-out songs. They have songs that encourage introspection, songs about empowerment, songs that thank fans, songs about heartbreak, and a plethora of other topics. Their lyrics are often humble and based on their real experiences.One of the most all-rounded groups. I think this is the only group I know where every member plays at least one instrument, participates in songwriting, and come up with insanely catchy choreos. Their synchronization is on another level, which they are very well-known for. All members are vocalists, despite having a dedicated vocal unit. Moreover, all members are dancers, although they do have a dedicated performance unit to make the choreos. The rappers of the group are very talented and have released very listen-worthy tracks and mixtapes.Perhaps the least problematic group. Kpop has had its fair share of controversies, with either some members saying or doing something inappropriate, insensitive, or ignorant, or the entire group engaging in a circus fest. SVT might be the only group that has managed to avoid controversies. The members themselves are very aware of the issues of colorism, racism, sexism, and other social issues. You will see this reflected in their lyrics, their actions, or simply the way they treat others. They are very respectful of fellow idols and staff members and remain humble.The best choreos and some of the best songs. One of the most important aspects of a group is how much you can enjoy them. SVT is well-known for their intricate and creative choreographies. If you notice their live stages, you will see how their dances have a theatrical vibe. They\u2019re very passionate performers and never slack no matter how tired they are. Music taste, I know, is subjective. SVT is one of those groups that experiment with different genres, with most of their songs leaning towards R&B, Soul, Hiphop, Pop, Orchestral EDM, and Rock, leaving something for everyone.I don\u2019t think I have and will come across another group as unique as SEVENTEEN. They changed the way I view Kpop and made me realize that 13 members is not too many, when you get 13 equally-talented and equally-involved members with unique personalities that never fail to amaze you.

            "answer_text": "I can talk page up and page down about SHINee, but I\u2019ll do it quickly. SHINee is my favourite K-pop group and the reason is very simple - they\u2019re wonderful. Their music ranges from sweet ballads to upbeat dance songs. Wikipedia describes their genres from ranging from contemporary RnB to funk rock to complextro to deep house. SHINee experiments with music and the outcome is always wonderful because SHINee\u2019s vocals are not only suited for one genre. They\u2019re extremely talented and passionate in their art and many of the members like to veer into other aspects than just performing. The notion that K-pop groups don\u2019t make their own music doesn\u2019t stand true with SHINee either as both Minho and Key have been actively participating in writing the lyrics to their raps, Jonghyun both has composed and written lyrics to several of SHINee\u2019s songs and Onew also has written the lyrics to a few of their songs. As far as I know, Taemin has only been penning the lyrics for his own solo songs so far. But not only is their music really really wonderful to listen to, the 5 members of SHINee presents themselves in such a familiar way, that if you first start following SHINee, you will soon find yourself with 5 friends. They have all matured a lot since their debut and it\u2019s obvious. You can tell the development in them. And they never once faked their relationship. Key got a small hit for saying they were only colleagues back in the day, but as such he spoke the truth. Jonghyun also revealed that he saw them as colleagues - they were brought together by work. You will get to know little tidbits of SHINee because they are genuine yet not overly open. And you\u2019ll be able to feel their bond as well. The collegian bond they share but still makes them so very fond of each other. So I said I was gonna be quick and now I ramble on and on. That\u2019s what SHINee does to you. As for favourite song? It\u2019s probably SHINee\u2019s discography. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me give you my top 5 list(; 1.BTS This is probably not surprising to you since BTS has been taking the world by storm these last two years. The reason why I love BTS so much is that they have such a strong bond with each other and their fans, and the songs they write are so meaningful. I love them for the fact that they love every single individual fan and they call ARMY their extended family. This makes us feel so close to them and the fact that we matter means so much. So if you haven't listened to BTS, I'm telling you, STOP READING THIS AND PUT ON YOUR HEADPHONES. btw, my bias is Jungkookie!<3 2. Black Pink This is also a predictable one, but Black Pink is by far my favorite girl group ever. Since they debuted, they've only released five songs and they're growing in popularity by the minute. I love Black Pink because they are unique and have such an edge to their songs. The rappers are full of swag and the vocalists are sweet as honey, which is a nice contrast. If your gonna listen to a girl group, Black Pink is a good choice! btw, my bias is Lisa! <3 3. Red Velvet This girl group is sweeter than the actual cake, and it's not hard to believe why. The group debuted in early 2014, and have been making epic comebacks ever since. I love these girls because they have an American Pop feel to them. They have different sound effects than a usual K Pop group, especially in the tracks \"Bad Boy\" and \"Peek-a-Boo\". They have grown so much since debut and I am awaiting a new comeback! btw, my bias is Wendy!<3 4. SEVENTEEN My second favorite boy band! SEVENTEEN is amazing because their songs have that \"ocean\" feel to them, and their choreography is just amazing with all twelve members going at it. They are in a way like BTS, but they brach off into their own definition with their diverse members and different grades of talent. If you ever find yourself a SEVENTEEN fan, congratulations! They're an excellent choice! btw, my bias is Wonwoo!<3 5. TWICE You saw this coming. Since TWICE is the most popular girl group, it's not difficult to believe that they would make it onto this list. These girls are sweet as sugar and I love their music because it's the classic girl group \"bubblegum-like\" songs and dances. They have such light voices, and their rappers can never be too edgy either. They have an amazing Christmas album, which I listen to over the holidays, and their songs are probably most like Anime openings. I can never say enough about these girls, but there you have it. btw, my bias is Momo!<3 That is my top 5 picks for K-Pop groups! I hope you listen to some of their songs if you haven't, and always remember that \"Once you Jimin, you can't Jimout!\" So be careful or else you'll get sucked into deep fandom! ARMY FIGHTING! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m just gonna copy and paste my answer to a previous question.  Without a doubt, BTS!!! It was this past Labor Day, when I was relaxing and watching YouTube videos of different kinds of people reacting to different video. Then I came across a video of \u201cTeens reacting to K-Pop\u201d, and what do you know? BTS happened to be on there with their video for \u201cBlood Sweat and Tears\u201d. I thought to myself, \u201cThis sounds so good. Let me check it out.\u201d After watching the music video in its entirety, I was completely SOLD! From there, it led me to checking out some more of their music. I really got drawn into how their lyrics/choreography are things that you don\u2019t see or hear in today\u2019s pop music anymore. They actually write/produce their own songs which talk about relatable social issues. They\u2019re also not afraid to express their dorky yet genuine selves in interviews and offstage. That\u2019s how I became a fan. In the beginning, I did not have a bias. And to be honest, I do not have an ultimate bias because I love and support every single member in different ways. That being said, my current bias is Jungkook with Suga being my wrecker. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you asking about K-pop bands?  Or K-pop groups?  Because there is a difference between the two. I\u2019ll assume you really mean bands and in that case my answer is: DAY6 Main reasons I\u2019m a big fan: I really like all the music styles they explored in more than 60 original songs - their music is very different from what popular k-pop groups offer - and at the same time very similar to english rock, but they also have ballads and some experimental songs,4 professional vocalists and drummer - their live covers are top notch,harmonizing, harmonizing, and again, harmonizing, one of the biggest reason I love their songs.write their own lyrics, very relatable, beautiful and deep,make their own music,I enjoy to follow their own solo projects:Young K makes covers (Young One project),Jae (or should I say eaJ?) writes and I guess also compose his own lazy (his own words!) songsJae\u2019s funny YT channelByron\u2026 who you ask? The guy who makes videos where he\u2019s roasting chicken\u2026. (the last video will explain xD)Music examples: Rock ballad I guess Covers & Harmonizing Lyrics - english version of Congratulation (for having no heart, dear ex!) Young One, Korean Sinatra eaJ who\u2019s the greatest dancer in JYP, THE GREATEST DANCER IN WHOLE K-POP?!! aaand Jae\u2019s own video editor Byron roasting the one and only Chicken Little (Jae) Yeah, that\u2019s probably everything. Hope I\u2019ve not forgot anything important, lol. 2. The Rose  For me Woosung, lead vocalist, is the brightest star in this small band and the main reason I like The Rose. His voice is very unique and I had to get used to how it sounds. It wasn\u2019t love at first listen. But his confidence, performance and stage presence! A shining star! One can tell he belongs to and loves stage and spotlight. Sadly, The Rose is at halt right now because of some legal stuff with the label they are under. Such a pity, I really hope they will come back soon with another great songs! Favorite live sessions   Favorite song and MV  3. N.Flying  Funny guys. Two of their members have YT channel called 2idiots. Guess it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. I don\u2019t know much about this band, their music isn\u2019t exactly what I like and look for. But for some time I listened to this song a lot:  4. CORONA No joke. They debuted several years ago (couldn\u2019t google when because all uncle google found was about YouKnowWhat\u2026). I know absolutely nothing about this indie band but I\u2019ve listened countless times to their Flower. Just beautiful. Sadly, other songs were not as interesting as this one.  ",

            "answer_text": "I will be ranking this based on Kpop groups\u2019 peak popularity, so that means a couple 2nd gen artists will be included. This is my opinion, because usually a lot of views/records are now mostly made by the same couple hundred or thousand people streaming, so these are usually not legitimate views. I\u2019m not saying streaming is bad though. BTSBlackPinkbro BlackPink literally BLEW UP in 2018 and the Coachella era, and everyone knew them. That was their peak, at least for now. Because of the lack of content and music they have been releasing, sadly the hype really died down and much of it has been replace by hate or indifference.2NE12NE1 had a VERY successful but short lived era of hype. They could easily have switched spots with BlackPink on this list if Bom hadn\u2019t had the drug scandal.BigBangSame situation as 2NE1, except the scandals were the Burning Sun and marijuana scandals.Girls\u2019 GenerationTWICETwice is still riding the peak of their popularity, and it will probably stay like that for at least a year. Arguably they and Girls\u2019 Generation could switch places.EXOSHINeeSomething about mentioning SHINee always makes me nostalgic :(Stray KidsNCTY\u2019all needa watch out for Stray Kids and NCT. They\u2019re slowly riding their way to the top of the popularity list. Unless there is a big drug/sex related scandal with them, I can guaranteed you that they will bag at least the top 7 or even 5 on this list.BONUS: PSY. If the question here was asking for Kpop artists, PSY would have made it to the top. Even though Gangnam Style and Gentleman were overplayed, you can\u2019t deny that they are freakin iconic and everyone bopped to them. It was on Just Dance and I\u2019m pretty sure it even made it to GoNoodle (according to my friend\u2019s little sister lmao)",

            "answer_text": "Okay sisters, I hope you\u2019re ready to stan the girl group of the next generation of K-pop, because you will not be able to read this answer without stanning. \u201cAnd what group would that be,\u201d I hear you asking. Well, let me tell you. Na na na nana na na na nanaNanana nananaEVERGLOWNa na na nana na na na nanaNanana nanana First off, who is EVERGLOW?  EVERGLOW is a rookie K-pop girl group that debuted under Yuehua (Yoo-eh-hwa) Entertainment on March 18th, 2019 with their debut song, Bon Bon Chocolat. EVERGLOW has six members. 1. Kim Sihyeon (Sihyeon) is the second oldest member, lead vocalist, visual and face of the group. She was the fifth member to be revealed, and is known for her bunny teeth and sweet vocals.  2. Han Eunji (Mia) is the third oldest member, main vocalist and main dancer. She was the second member to be revealed, and is known for looking like a younger version of 2ne1\u2019s CL.  3. Jo Serim (Onda) is the third youngest member and lead vocalist. She was the third member to be revealed, and is known for her incredible dance skills and nearly perfect smile.  4. Wang Yiren (Yiren) is the maknae, vocalist, visual, center and lead dancer. She was the fourth member to be revealed, and is known for her incredible visuals, cute appearance, traditional Chinese dance and flexibility.  5. Park Jiwon (E:U) is the oldest member, leader, main rapper, main dancer and main vocalist. She was the fifth member to be revealed, and is known for her iconic platinum blonde hair that she has had since before debut.  6. Heo Yoorim (Aisha) is the second youngest member, lead rapper and vocalist. She was the final member to be revealed, and is known for her height (she\u2019s one of the tallest female idols in all of K-pop at 5\u2032 8\u2033!).   Next up, the music. Sure, EVERGLOW only has three songs:    BUT\u2014 each of them are vastly different from the other two. The range and diversity that they displayed in this debut album is incredibly impressive. I mean they already have more variety in their music than some popular-girl-groups-with-four-members-that-debuted-in-2016-with-one-of-my-favorite-debuts-of-all-time. I would highly recommend listening to each of the songs and basking in the beautiful vocals, especially in Moon and D+1.  The music video. They currently have only one music video (but a new one is dropping with their comeback on Monday!), ignoring that that is a very sad fact for those of us that stan these girls, it is a fantastic music video. They really wanted to show off their superb choreography and beautiful visuals with this video, and they did just that. It is one of my favorite debut music videos of all time, and I would highly recommend it.   This may just be their strongest point: their dance and choreography is out of this world. There\u2019s a clip of BTS circulating on Twitter again of them dancing to \u201cSave ME\u201d and they\u2019re so in sync it\u2019s kind of scary and stan twitter is shook over it. Yeah, that\u2019s EVERGLOW all the time. I mean, just watch these dance covers:    Especially these next three:    Yeah. I know. You\u2019re welcome.  And now, what I consider to be the most important factor in any musical group: chemistry. These girls are best friends and complete crackheads. You can tell that they\u2019re all incredibly close, which is what I\u2019d attribute a great deal of BTS\u2019s own success to. If they continue to show their chemistry, I think they have the potential to climb to the top of the industry just as BTS did.    And now I will leave you with this YouTube playlist I compiled: try not to stan EVERGLOW challenge (impossible!!1! she did what?!) - YouTube This playlist includes every video I linked in this answer as well as some I didn\u2019t. I will be adding to this playlist as EVERGLOW keeps pumping out stan-worthy content.  in closing: stan everglow for clear skin. ",

Shownu is one of the best dancers in the industry (haha i said it), Joohoneys rapping is *chefs kiss*, and Kihyuns vocals are sooo good. 2. my next group is Cravity. i honestly love this group so much\ud83d\ude02. they are hilarious! their show on Vlive \u201cCravity Park\u201d is lowkey the best part of my week. woobin is one of the best vocalists in the 4th generation. try to prove me wrong! they all act really close to each other. of course we don\u2019t know how they are off camera but on camera they are just so wholesome. they are definitely all allrounders and ROTY material.  3. next we have Ateez! i literally became an atiny like a month ago and i wish i had known of them sooner! they literally have no bad songs and they are so versatile. definitely recommend checking them out.  ok my next groups are gonna be groups i recommend and am starting to listen to but i\u2019m not gonna write a whole paragraph because i\u2019m not that familiar with them yet. 4. Seventeen- every. song. is. good.  5. AB6IX- daehwi has my whole heart  6. Secret Number- who dis?  7. ASTRO- saw them for the first time at Dream Concert today\u2026.  8. CIX- Movie Star is my new favorite song  9. Mamamoo- their solo stuff is amazing too  10. The Boyz- road. to. kingdom.  buh bye\u2763\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "I have been waiting for this question FOREVER. My top two kpop ships are MoonSun (Moonbyul and Solar from Mamamoo) and Nyongtory (Seungri and Gdragon from Big Bang). If you don\u2019t ship MoonSun or stan Mamamoo yet, I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re doing. How fun and flirty they are together. Precious Solar combined with straightforward Moonbyul makes the cuteness even more overwhelming.  Greasy/perverted Moonbyul.  The gayness of Mamamoo in general.  All of this, without even considering MoonSun\u2019s onstage chemistry. I think they are actually together, but no one would know except for the two of them. Nyongtory, in case you didn\u2019t know, is GRi but in Korean (G for Gdragon and Ri for Seungri). It\u2019s difficult to ship any of the Big Bang members with each other because each member can be shipped with almost anyone else, without even taking 2ne1 into account. Gdragon and Seungri are so flirty onstage, and Gdragon always looks like he is falling for Seungri. As a VIP, this ship is everything to me. I think it\u2019s just fan servicing, but who cares? They\u2019re still so adorable and I know and hope that one day it will become cannon. Gdragon has declared his love for Seungri.  There are too many videos of the two of them\u2026so I just picked this one. I hope that all of them will be able to be with the ones they truly love and continue to make great music. ",

            "answer_text": "The group that got me into K-Pop\u2014Blackpink. I first heard Boombayah in a slime video, I kid you not. The intro was catchy, and, curious, I looked them up. I listened to their songs, watched their interactions. I decided, wow, I like them! And suddenly, I entered the world of K-Pop. The group that made me stay\u2014Orange Caramel. Interesting choice, right? Orange Caramel isn\u2019t exactly everyone\u2019s first pick these days (sadly), but that didn\u2019t stop me from falling in love with their music. Their music videos are hilarious, cute, and aesthetically pleasing. Their music is catchy, fun, and never fails to put a smile on my face. Their personalities are entertaining, and even philosophical sometimes. To this day, Nana is still my ultimate bias. Had I not discovered Orange Caramel, I wouldn\u2019t have become so devoted to this genre of music, nor would I have taken the time to appreciate other groups. But, with Orange Caramel\u2019s indefinite hiatus, I was forced to find other groups. The group that won my heart\u2014Twice. I love these girls. It feels weird saying that, since I\u2019ve never met any of them in my life and I don\u2019t know them personally. With other idols, I\u2019m sometimes cautious of how they act on camera. Maybe someone I thought was a nice person is actually nasty in real life, and I could never know. But Twice changed my mind\u2014they\u2019re such pleasant girls: down-to-earth, humble, fun-loving, hilarious, and personable. Not to mention, I love cute concepts, and Twice has such a unique sound. Their style can\u2019t be found in Western pop. I will forever rave to me likey and jjirit jjirit and I\u2019m like TT until the end of time, I kid you not. Twice brings light into my life\u2014through their charming personalities and captivating music. Seriously, stan Twice. But what about boy groups? Me? Forget? I would never. While I\u2019m mainly a girl group stan, some boys have really left an impression on me. The boy group with my favorite music\u2014Astro. Boy groups with cute concepts make my day. Hide and Seek is so catchy and adorable and fun; I can play it in the morning, at night, in the afternoon, whenever. All Night is an absolute banger. Always You is beautiful, and Innocent Love is a nice ballad song. I just really like Astro. Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. ",

BTS have literally everything I need right now- The musicMotivation to keep livingThem being themselves/memes/adorable/oops I\u2019m pregnant nowThe fandomTheir music is special. Yes, I feel like they are getting more westernized, but if you go look back at their older songs, they really seem to have their own sound in my opinion. They sing/rap about loving yourself and not worrying about the haters. I think that\u2019s really cool. Their music and their personalities make me want to wake up each day and hear them singing/rapping. To hear Jimin\u2019s high note in Am I Wrong?, to listen to Suga/Agust D rap The Last, to see Jhope dance to Just Dance, etc. They make me want to wake up and get out of bed. To go to school when I don\u2019t want to. And I applaud them for that. Also their dualities are on FIRE. Like, Jhope (my bias) can go from cocoa butter sunshine flower boi to me saying under my breath, \u201cShit my ovaries.\u201d They are all hilarious and watching a run episode now and then is really fun. The fandom is really nice. I\u2019ve never met a \u201ctoxic\u201d A.R.M.Y before, and that\u2019s great. There are a few fan boys I know at my school and my two friends and I are big fans as well. There are a lot of people who know them, but don\u2019t listen to them as well at my school. The A.R.M.Y projects they do for BTS is outstanding. I\u2019ve never been more proud to call myself something like this is a long time. ~ I was originally gonna make this answer longer, so that\u2019s why it was taking me a while.

            "answer_text": "I'm an exo-L, army, moomoo, sunday and meu but in my opinion, infinite is the most impressive kpop group I have ever seen. In the beginning I didn't pay much attention to them, I just thought they were like shinee version2. But I am so glad I got to know so much more about them. Sunggyu, sometimes dismissed as a funny sloth, is not only an amazing vocalist, but is also the best leader I have seen so far. He made me cry in the first episode of infinite showtime itself. Woohyun is a top class vocalist and is so funny. Don't take L to be just a pretty face. He's a true gentleman and has an adorable personality. And unlike other groups with useless visuals, this guy can sure sing (watch him on masked singer) and nobody looks as handsome as him while playing a guitar. Ah and our precious Dongwoo. He will never fail to put a smile on his face. He i's a human embodiment of sunshine. Even though his father recently passed away, he did not give up on promotions or get into a gloomy mood. He tried his best. Hoya, hot Hoya. If you watch hit the stage, you know how fire this dude is. Definitely one of the best dancers in kpop. Also an amazing rapper. Sungyeol imo is the most handsome guy I've ever seen with the best proportions. He is known to be a vocalist BUT WHEN HE RAPS IT'S KDJJDJDJ. He will make you laugh so hard your stomach will hurt. And then we have the maknae, Sungjong. He is the purest, sweetest kid I have ever seen or heard. Period. If you don't know much about infinite you must give them a chance. They will steal your hearts. Amazing albums, meaningful mvs and world famous knife sharp choroes (gods of synchronisation I must add). Watch any episode of weekly idol with them as guests, it will make your day. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Hi! I definitely recommend a group called highlight, formerly beast. They used to be under cube ent and have a 6th member but he left then the other 5 guys left cube to make their own company.  long answer: As they're their own bosses it gives lots of freedom. Freedom to have fun on stage, get some sleep, eat a healthy amount, and enjoy themselves tbh. I always see other fans talking about how worried they are for their bias but highlight fans are able to sleep easy knowing that highlight isn't pressured or harmed by a big label. To describe their music in one word it would be too difficult so instead ill describe it as an action. Picture someone doing the cha-cha slide but they're sobbing at the same time. I say this because their overall sound is very happy but songs like \u2018sleep tight\u2019 and \u2018its still beautiful\u2019 are so beautifully sad. ALSO since they run their own company, their own member Junhyung produces and writes the lyrics for each song. Lastly, there are also plenty of solo activities. Yang yoseob has a mini album which is very calming with amazing vocals. Lee Gikwang has a mini album out and its just a fun set of songs which his voice adds nicely to. Yong Junhyung has a mini album and will be coming out with a full one in a bit his songs are calming until you read translations then they're pretty sad. Son Dongwoon has been the mc for a few shows and on variety shows, and their leader Yoon dujun has been taking up acting and dang he\u2019s good. Thanks for reading, check them out if you want! ",

EXO: I\u2019ve been with exo since before their debut and they hold a very special place in my heart. Each member is so talented in everything they do. Exo\u2019s discography is one of the best out there. Exo has some of the best vocalists and dancers. Exo is just an all around great group. Red Velvet: I am absolutely in love with each member from Red Velvet. They are all SO talented and they are all so charismatic, it\u2019s hard not to fall for them. Their songs have so much variety, from fun, bubblegum pop to smooth, captivating r&b to powerful, emotional ballads. Seulgi is one of the best girl group dancers I\u2019ve seen. NCT: Even though their concept is a little messy and kind of all over the place, but their members are extremely talented. Ten is one of my favorite dancers in Kpop next to Taemin. The vocalists are very good as well. Their title tracks go hard for no reason and so do their B-Sides. Their choreography is extremely difficult and I give them mad props for executing it so well. Seventeen: They\u2019ve been training since they were super young and all that training really paid off. Their vocals are the most stable in the Kpop industry even while doing that difficult choreography they usually have. They are also one of the most in sync groups while dancing. Each member can sing and dance to almost perfection. Their music is great and each member gets a chance to shine. BTS: I\u2019ve been with them since debut and I\u2019m very glad I got to see them four times in concert and got to meet them. I\u2019m so proud of everything they\u2019ve accomplished this far and there\u2019s no where else to go except up from here. Even though I\u2019m not liking their new music, I can appreciate the message they\u2019re sending. There\u2019s no doubt that all the members are extremely talented and that their songs are all great. ",

            "answer_text": "I mostly listen to SM artists. Their stage performance are usually better than their recorded music. SM artists have lots of potential and hidden talent, it\u2019s just that, SM didn\u2019t give them much chance. Lots of SM artist can compose, play instrument, and choreograph. Also, it\u2019s worth mentioning that if you want to enjoy SM artists\u2019 work, you have to watch their live performance or dance version of the mv. Here are special mention of my favorite SM artists performance you might wanted to check: EXO - Eldorado  Chanyeol - All of Me (cover)  Chanyeol x D.O. - Love Yourself (cover)  Girls\u2019 Generation - Catch Me If You Can  F(x) - 4 Walls  DBSK - Catch Me  DBSK - Spellbound  There are plenty more but my head ran out of idea. SHINee live are also pretty amazing and Super Junior concept are always fun. Thus above are just my favorite that able to show SM top notch performance quality. Hope you enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "EXO Their name can fit anywhere; lightsticks, album covers, etc. Every single design is so creative and incorporates the group name into it. I love their logo as well, it\u2019s extremely flexible. Whoever dreamed up their name deserves a promotion! STRAY KIDS What makes this name so special to me is the fact that the members came up with it themselves. \u201cStray\u201d means that they are pushing the barriers of the music world, \u201cstraying\u201d away from the norms. I also think it could mean that they are trying to find themselves as \u201cstray\u201d could refer to being lost, especially with their I AM: trilogy. The group\u2019s name can also be abbrievated as SKZ, in case some people find it too long. RED VELVET It\u2019s perfect for their concept. They have their \u201cred\u201d side, which is fresh, cutesy, and cheerful (Power Up, Happiness, Red Flavor). Then they have their \u201cvelvet\u201d side, which can be creepy, mature and dark (Bad Boy, Peek-A-Boo). Once again, a win for the SM staff! NCT 127 First, NCT is so cool. It stands for Neo Culture Technology, and they are introducing a whole new \u201ctechnology\u201d with their creative music and concept! 127 is the coordinates of South Korea, which is pretty awesome. TXT It stands for \u201cTOMORROW X TOGETHER\u201d. The 5 of them are facing \u201ctomorrow\u201d \u201ctogether\u201d, and all came together because of 1 dream. I just think the combination of the two words is so beautiful, and the idea of this \u201cfriendship\u201d is really cute. ATEEZ ATEEZ means A to Z, which is really creative actually. But how cool is it to say \u201cATEEZ\u201d? It\u2019s like the perfect name that would instantly make you think of a K-Pop group. So catchy and easy to market. Even their fandom\u2019s name, ATINY, is lovely as well. DREAMCATCHER Yet another group whose name fits their concept. This name is just so ethereal, and I love that it can either be a dream or a nightmare. A dreamcatcher is actually an object which is really pretty, just like the group\u2019s concept. ",

But i\u2019m going to say my personal favorite (there\u2019s others but I\u2019m in class trying to waste time writing) STRAY KIDS:  I really look up to 3RACHA, Their predebut rap/hiphop group. Chan Is such a great leader and I hear a lot of ARMY\u2019S and EXO-Ls (Not so much exo-ls) Saying that their rap line is superior. I had an EXO-L the other day (PURE EXO-L) tell us how well SKZ had preformed at MAMA and how thankful they are to have performed EXO songs as well over time. An ARMY who isnt familiar with SKZ Much says that our rap line is top tier and that she hopes that SKZ and STAY go far in the contract time we have. Minho and Felix\u2019s Elimination:JYP must have saw how differently they acted without the other two. when they were brought back for their \u201cLast performance\u201d they pushed through so hard only because it was their last chance of having Minho and Felix back. Chan\u2019s Late nights: \u201cChan-hyung would stay at the studio til 5 am every day and then go back at 10 am. If I was him I would have collapsed by now,Really, Hes just amazing\u201d \u2014Jisung (Stray kids show) He did this so he could get them to debut sooner, and he did it out of love for his members \u201cHe teaches the choreography, and whenever we dont get it right, he reteaches until we do\u201d \u2014Jisung (SKZ show) 4 albums, 9months: FOUR albums and they\u2019ve only been Debuted for NINE months. and for the LONGEST time we were the \u201cUnnamed fandom\u201d by other fandoms. Who else has done that in that SHORT of time? 3Racha: They had put almost every member at risk except for a few, and they were rappers. If JYP wanted a rap group, they should have debuted 3Racha. Granted, I miss their music but they\u2019ve got SKZ. MAMA 2018: Hi, Little more of a rant now. First of, I want a StrayKids flag. Second, DISTRICT 9 ROCK VERSION: A CONCEPT 3rd: Minho had said he was nervous to perform in front of of Bangtan because he, a few years back, was a backup dancer for them. and yet\u2026 he killed it. 4th: Felix was SO SO SO SO SO energetic! I was proud uwu 5th: 3RACHA P.A.C.E. performance. It was so powerful and happy! 6th: Jisung\u2019s \u201cSTRAYKIDS IN THE BUILDINGGGGGG\u201d These kids deserve the world. Stan SKZ  ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, 1. Super Junior. The reason are it\u2019s my first group I stan, and the music, concert and even their variety skills never fail to amaze me. I really like almost all songs from the 1st album to the last album, not just the side track, even the subunit\u2019s song is cool. The concert is always amazing, like I love how good is their voice and dance, they can perform professionally as an idol, but they also can amuse us with ther brotherhood relation and funny moment on the show (I think funny moment isn\u2019t quite right, but Idk how to describe it, pardon \ud83d\ude05). But, I do listen some song to some groups and singers, although I don\u2019t follow their activity as I do on SJ. I quite like many song that they released. For group, they are NCT Dream, TVXQ, EXO, SNSD, and SHINee. As they all are in the same company as SJ, I really like the interaction between them, like DBSJ (Show Me Your Love, Analog Trip), SuGen (Seoul Song, Idk another project but there are so many fanfic about it and it\u2019s fun to read some of them), and some variety shows. For singers, K.Will, Gummy, IU, and Kim Jong-Kook (although he isn\u2019t making any album for these past years). They have a lot of songs that incredible and quite catchy that included as favourite song in my playlist. I really hope KJK will release a new album as a singer. There are some song from group that I listen just 1 or 2, and mostly it\u2019s their title track. I don\u2019t really fond of their song or style of music, but 1 or 2 of their songs is quite good. They are 2PM, Sechskies, BTS, EXID, Girl\u2019s Day, Big Bang, iKON, BTOB, Apink, KARD, Blackpink, and RV. As I\u2019m kinda SMstan, mostly group that I listen to come from SM. I join the fandom since 10 years ago, so I think I kinda prefer to 2nd to 3rd generation group. I don\u2019t listen much girlgroup, since I don\u2019t really like most of girlgroup concept because I find them quite boring, but some of them is good. Update: Let me add a picture of Super Junior, I\u2019ve been really wanted to add a picture to my answer.  Souce: google ",

            "answer_text": "Day6 This band. I thought I couldn\u2019t love a group more than BTS, but then I found Day6. And it\u2019s not that I\u2019ve given up on the BTS boys (not even close). I\u2019m still a full-blown army. But since diving into Day6\u2019s music, I\u2019ve discovered a depth and rawness that isn\u2019t often encountered in Kpop or American pop music. Day6 writes most of their own songs, and one of their members, YoungK, writes almost all of their lyrics. As a result, they have a very distinctive sound and lyrical presence. It\u2019s a band, so they all play instruments. Their talent is incredible! And of course, they are so funny. Their members are always making My Days (their fangroup) smile. Stan talent! Stan Day6! Loona One quite underrated and special woman groups nowadays in my opinion. They premiered in 2018, after months and months of buzz. Actually, it absolutely was one of many coolest marketing and advertising methods I\u2019ve ever before present in Kpop. Fundamentally, Loona was like, \u201cHi, we\u2019re perhaps not likely to be a woman group that perhaps eventually ends up having a couple solamente musician projects in some years. Many of us are going to be solo musicians and artists INITIALLY, and then we\u2019ll bond which will make anything even better-a woman team made up of crazy skilled, *individual* musicians.\u201d So that is among fundemental concepts of Loona. Ahead of debut, each one of the 12 people debuted separately due to their own solamente songs. In addition, subgroup paths had been introduced. This is why method, Loona currently features a large track record, despite having just debuted last summer. If you would like development, you\u2019ll def like Loona. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Starting with the ones i first started listening to: ASTRO  The main reason i love this group is because of their uniqueness. Kpop boy groups with bad-boy themed songs & cool sexy vibes are really on high rise in the industry. Also, almost every kpop boy group you see belongs to the above category. However, Astro surprised me by delivering strong cute concepts. Their songs make me laugh, sad & are overall so emotionally satisfactory. They're the cutest, fun filled lads you've ever to imagine. BTS  No doubt they're one of the most demanded boy bands of the century not only nationally but even globally. I never really tried listening to their songs cuz i believed they're overrated. But then i happened to hear DNA & trust me i went bonkers and started researching more about them. Their songs are magic & they heartily deserve all the recognition they are getting. WEKI MEKI  Not really a fan of girl groups, but they prove it otherwise. Basically a rookie group but watch out for the power packed talented girls. RED VELVET  I just adore them with my whole heart. They're no less than any boy group out there. Talented well deserved queens must say. Other groups i recommend would surely be : UP10TION SHINEE SEVENTEEN EXO A. O. A That's the end of my bias list. Fighting!!! ",

            "answer_text": "GOT7  GOT7 is my favorite Group and no matter how much I like songs from other groups etc. no group is for me like GOT7 and here are some reasons why. PersonalityI think that they have one of the most honest personalities in KPOP. They say their thoughts and opinions, they're saying mostly their struggles and hardships. They are honestly talking about their relationship and their fights. They are so thankful and thoughtful. They have problems and issues just like everyone else. They are doing mistakes and they are learning from their mistakes. They are one of the loveliest and most caring idols I personally know. And they have two groups that are really really really close to them. MONSTA X      And BTOB     2. Hardwork I know that every other group is working hard. GOT7 has foreign members. And they had to sacrifice a lot to debut. Just like the Korean members. They had in 2016 or 17 a really hard time and they felt really bad. Jackson cried while talking about the hardship they had to went through. Everyone had their struggles and they had their own hardships. They are doing their best and are thanking their fans for everything but..we feel like that we don't do enough. Bambam is crying everytime when he feel bad for us. And he usually don't cry. We never saw him crying since the letter from his mother that he became when he went with Jackson to a survival show. He felt so bad for us..told us so many sad things..oh god when I think about it I have to cry again\u2026 he told us that we should care about us more, that we shouldn't do everything for GOT7 but for our selves too. That he things that we are doing so much but they don't\u2026. Arghh this boy\u2026 What I want to say: They worked so hard but still didn't got that what they deserve. But they created a wonderful fandom. They created us Ahgases. So he shouldn't feel bad. Because I'm so happy. They are recently the only ones that can give me a smile..  3. Friendship They don't have only a good relationship with BTOB and Monsta X. And the maknaes with some 97 liner (Bts, Seventeen\u2026) they also have a really good relationship with each members family. No joke xD. The family members also have a wonderful relationship together! GOT7s relationship is one of the most genuine relationships ever. They fight or fought a lot xD but that's how they grew more and more together. They have different tastes or different personalities but they are getting along so well \u2026WOW. They are so close together and that's so sweet. Like bambam said:  They went through a lot together. That's why they are not only group members but real friends..a real family. And that's another point why I love them so much. Here are some family pics: JB, Yugyeom and Mark with Marks family  The Mothers( except Jacksons mother because she couldn't come), who are doing GOT7s Sign.  JB with Jacksons Parents  Mark and Jackson with Jacksons Family  GOT7 is such a lovely group ^^ And their friendship is Gold. And I love how supportive their familys are..even when some of them weren't really happy with this choice at first 4. Everything else Their music -masterpieces Their reality shows -hilarious Their talent -amazing \u2026. These were some examples why I love them so much ^^. For me they couldn't be better. They are doing what they love. And even when they regret some things that they did. These things lead them to GOT7. They are perfect in their imperfection. GOT7 stands for 7 people that came together. With different backgrounds, different nationalities and different personalities. That is what makes this group so unique. Like Jackson said: 7 for 7, 7 or nothing. GOT7 only exists with all of them. And We IGOT7s, we AHGASES only exist when GOT7 exist. I hope that you liked my post^^   ",

They are the only two groups where I can confidently say, I know every song, I know all the inside jokes, I\u2019ve watched almost all of their shows (I\u2019m behind on Run BTS lol I\u2019m tired ok). Not saying that you have to know everything when you stan a group, I just love them so much that I want to be a super invested fan. Monsta X:  Monsta X perfectly matches my taste in music. They have hardcore hip hop influenced music, while also having a lot of amazing slower songs with top tier vocals. They have one of the best rap lines in kpop, and their choreography is soooo good I could watch them dance all day. BTS:  ^I love this picture The first Kpop group I got into, and I\u2019ll never forget being introduced to the amazing world of kpop for the first time. They have talent written all over them, are hardworking, and have an amazing message behind their songs and lyrics.

            "answer_text": "INFINITE.  My beautiful boys, Infinite. I don\u2019t think I can provide the perfect answer for the reason why I stan them. I\u2019ve been a fan for four years, and I can\u2019t stop but love them each and every day. They make me smile, laugh, cry, they make me live. The fandom and Infinite are going through a hard time right now. Fans are already taking sides, blaming each other and even leaving the fandom. I know everyone has their own opinions, but if they have been sincere when they carved \u201cInspirit\u201d on their chest throughout the years they supported Infinite, they would have stayed and fought for Infinite. Just as the six members have fought to keep the name \u201cInfinite\u201d. I\u2019m not saying that Hoya is the bad one here, I\u2019m sure it was hard for him to make a decision in leaving the group too. It\u2019s hard and I still feel weird for seeing only six members in the grp, but I respect and support his choice. He can go far with his talents. I believe in him. If I have to answer the reason why I stan them (and Hoya), it\u2019s because I felt the sincerity from them. It\u2019s hard to see that in other groups. They take care of the fans well and make us their priority. They worried abt us a lot, they got angry and complained if the staffs mistreated the fans, and they always try to give back as much as we give. I feel so loved being in the fandom. It\u2019s like I\u2019m being squished from their hugs and they refused to let go of my hands. I guess they lived up to their songs for being an obsessive boyfriend lol. They are all so sweet. Never it has crossed in my mind, to leave the fandom. I still have a lot more to give back to them from all their loves and efforts. So I should support them til the end. I hope Inspirits who are reading this will stay strong for Infinite. Have faith in Infinite and Hoya! ",

            "answer_text": "SHINee SHINee wasn't even my first kpop group I actually got into kpop because of infinite n super junior but SHINee attracted me with their bops and sucked me deep into their blackhole with their ballads(SHINee has legendary bops but their b-side tracks n ballads are absolute winners so good n soothing on ears n their solo works are amazing too). I have always been a sucker for good harmonies n SHINee\u2019s harmonies are probably most of the best harmonies that I have listened to(seriously listen to 1000 years by your side 130920 SHINee 2013 United States Odaiba Alarm live_(480p) - \ub3d9\uc601\uc0c1 Dailymotion (from 12:51) it's such a beautiful song). When it comes to performances they are absolutely amazing it's not just shawols who agree with it. The way they sound so stable n amazing while doing their complicated n hard choreographies is unbelievable. The fact that there was a server breakdown in england due to the ticket bookings for a SHINee act wayback in 2011 to the completely sold out recent Tokyo dome shows how relevant they had been in the kpop act dispite them being a 10year old group. The way they treat their fans n the way they express their gratitude towards their fans is beautiful you can just feel it. The mutual respect that SHINee n shawols share is really incredible(Remember how key requested for the fans to keep his holiday a secret n release the pics later after he finishes his holiday n how they acknowledged his request. How they held mini fanmeets while waiting in the studio for music show recordings or performances). SHINee really are one of those groups that cannot be disliked even if you are not a SHINee fan, (maybe not stan them) you will still end up liking them. Their discography is so broad that you will find atleast a couple of songs of your liking for sure. SHINee will always be the top group for me. While stanning a single group in Kpop you will come across many other groups n kpop has so much to offer that it's really hard to ignore others so the other groups that I follow are big bang, vixx, super junior, dbsk, snsd, f(x), 4minute, exo, btob, seventeen, 2ne1, infinite, cnblue, akmu n many more mostly 2nd n 3rd gen kpop n just a few new gen groups. Note: Shawols struggles are way too real when it comes to picking a bias so I didn't mention my bias. ",

            "answer_text": "There are too many on my list, because I love to appreciate all groups, whether they\u2019re big, small, or different in any way. In no particular order, here are some of my favorites. I\u2019ll list the girls first. Red Velvet - The members are all so beautiful, and I appreciate their versatility in their concept, as well as their consistency in quality. Wendy is also a top-tier vocalist. Seulgi has a very distinct tone. Irene is a high-grade visual, and Joy is my bias. Yeri is the relatable maknae. They\u2019re very cohesive. If they have a concert in my state, I will buy tickets and rush there with my friends. Gfriend - I love their concept; it\u2019s like a breath of fresh air. Their style is clean and classy, and I adore the girls. They\u2019re one of the first girl groups I became a fan of when getting into kpop groups. I also appreciate that their agency lets them try new styles; it\u2019s great! Yuju is a very good vocalist as well. If they perform in my state, I will also rush to see them. TWICE - I\u2019m very basic, and so I love their music. That\u2019s mostly what it is. And I\u2019ve also been a huge fan of Jeonghan ever since the beginning, before I even liked the group. I don\u2019t know the members very well, but I just appreciate when Jeonghan gets more attention and lines. It makes me happy. Oh My Girl - They have some really nice hits, like \u201cLiar Liar\u201d and \u201cWindy Day\u201d. Their group has such a quirky but cute and sweet style; it\u2019s really something amazing. I\u2019m sure they are plenty successful in South Korea, too. I also was a big fan of their \u201cBanana Allergy Monkey\u201d comeback with the unit. Lovelyz - This group has some very interesting sounds in their music. I find it to be full of satisfying synth sounds for certain songs; their songs are not stereotypically catchy like TWICE, but their melodies are a little more complex and still interesting at the same time. Also Kei is an amazing vocalist. Girls\u2019 Generation - Can\u2019t beat it, they are the queens. Classic group, legendary members, with so many talents. I love a lot of their music, and they are such powerful women; over time, their influence has reached a very high level. I appreciate Taeyeon, Tiffany, and Jessica\u2019s vocal talents a lot too. LOONA - I\u2019ve been following them since Kim Lip\u2019s Eclipse came out, and I really love the effort their company puts in for them. Promotion was done so well; they also hired Monotree to direct their videos, which was a great choice. The songs are high quality and satisfying, and the girls are versatile. Orbits forever. This is a group I would attend a concert to see. KHAN - The two members from the disbanded group The Ark are in this duo. They have amazing talent in dancing and singing; their stability is amazing. I believe they have not lip synced on stage a single day at all when they promoted \u201cI\u2019m Your Girl\u201d. I watched close to all of their lives and I can tell. Dancing and singing at the same time, but perfectly? They are the bomb. BLACKPINK - I discovered them from the beginning\u2026 right at debut. I was 15 and excited. I watched \u201cBoombayah\u201d and I knew I wanted to stan these unnies right away. So I did, and more than two years later, I\u2019m still with them, supporting them. (I don\u2019t buy physical stuff but I purchase their songs on iTunes, being a poor college student lol) This is a group that I want to attend a concert for someday. 4minute (disbanded) - I didn\u2019t get into kpop until after they disbanded, but I really like their high energy songs; so impactful, while also being total jams. Hyuna is a beast, by the way. Can\u2019t escape her power. SISTAR (disbanded) - I believe I may have seen an MV of theirs while out and about at restaurants, but I wasn\u2019t into pop at the time even, sadly. I discovered their summer bops and it was glorious. I now follow the activities of Hyolyn. I.O.I. (disbanded) - Quite possibly could be named as one of the best idol groups of all time. Full of visual and true talent; the best of the best, trained through their own companies AND a survival show. Faced a lot of trials. I really appreciated that there were a good amount of members who could speak English, as that\u2019s something a majority of idol groups lack nowadays. I find it helps to really increase international appeal. Those are all the groups that I invest time in following to the best of my ability. I like more groups, but this list would be too long if I included everyone. Onto the boys! There are a lot less that I really like. BTS - I don\u2019t like to call myself an A.R.M.Y., but I do like BTS music. I don\u2019t follow all their releases because I\u2019m so swamped in my girl group world, but this is the boy group that I\u2019ve purchased the most songs from on iTunes. And I\u2019m really stingy, so this says a lot. I appreciate these men a lot, and their hard work. VIXX - I enjoy their classy and sensual style. As a group, they work together well. I really have to admit, I became a fan of them initially because of \u201cChained Up\u201d. It\u2019s such an amazing song and a really pretty video. A lot of their music videos are so artistic and inspiring. As a visual artist myself, I like taking a look at their MVs every now and then. GOT7 - I haven\u2019t been into them enough in order to say I\u2019m an iGOT7, but I appreciate them as a group and I like \u201cJust Right\u201d quite a lot. As someone who has done martial arts for 11 years myself, I appreciate Mark Tuan\u2019s martial arts tricking skills a lot; actually he is my bias. I just kind of related right there. Also their visuals are on point. SEVENTEEN - I have invested a lot of time in this group; I\u2019ve tried so hard to learn the members and I\u2019ve gotten pretty far, so I\u2019ll keep going. But aside from that, their hard work and sheer dedication to being an incredibly self-sufficient group is incredible. SEVENTEEN has got to be my absolute personal favorite boy group of all time. Their songs are consistently good and they pull off every concept so well. They commit to it. I truly admire them\u2026 hats off to the oppas. NCT Dream - I became a fan of them right when they debuted; I was 15, I related to them, and I connected more easily because I was the same age as them (granted, Chenle and Jisung were 13 at the time, but you get the point). I liked their cute bubblegum pop sound, and their dance skills were quite good. Their visuals were nice as well; although they\u2019ve grown out of the little boy image, I still appreciate them a lot. ASTRO is a group that I want to appreciate; hopefully I can find more time to look into them. I hear Cha Eun-woo is becoming very popular recently. I liked their song \u201cHide and Seek\u201d quite a lot, and I find the members to be adorable, so hopefully I can do more research about them. And those are the personal favorites I can think of at the moment! I know there are other groups out there that could be just as amazing as these, and I have yet to discover them. ",

            "answer_text": "Seventeen, or SVT. S(ynchonization), V(isuals), T(alent). Hands down. They came from nothing, locked away in the basement of a failing and poor company, their debut kept getting pushed back (for 2/3 years!). They worked so hard, promoting themselves, and look where they are now. They produce all of their own music and award winning choreographies. They\u2019re so damn synchronized , its insane. Their best known is probably Dont Wanna Cry, which won 5 awards since it\u2019s such a work of ART. I recommend that you watch it, they\u2019re all so synchronized (which is hard to do with a group of THIRTEEN boys) and dance so well. They are all such genuinely nice, talented, and kind people. They thanks and love their fans so much. They\u2019ve even made a title song just for their fans, called Thanks. I have heard COUNTLESS firsthand stories of the kindness of seventeen from so many types of people, from fans to reporters. They also have a bond that no other group can really compare to. They work so well as a team and love each other so much, it so evident. There are so many examples of this; you can find them anywhere on youtube. Each member has a ring that they got when they debuted. They\u2019re all identical and they really bind the members together. They treasure their rings and their connections to each other so much. Bonus: EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, they have heart to heart conversations AS A GROUP, reflecting on the day and themselves and each other. EVERY NIGHT. Find me another group that has a bond as strong as theirs. I\u2019ll wait ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll talk about male group firstly :) 1.VIXX( my favourite group) I think their songs are really great. Almost every song has everything balanced. Anyone can feel the music from their song(as my opinion) They aren\u2019t popular as BTS but they deserve to be. Eternity, Shangri la, Scentist, Milky way, Walking, The closer, ECHO, Black out are few of their best songs actually I really liked their scentist and Shangri la album . And their OST are beautiful too(Alive, Is it love and also edge by vixx N)  2 .BTS BTS are quite popular right? Thanks to Fake love song. Honestly I\u2019m not a big fan of them but that song deserve popular it's beautiful actually I really enjoyed love yourself -answer album(almost every song in that album are beautiful) expect idol song. Actually I thought their next comeback will be beautiful than fake love but Idol is quite dissapointing. After listening to fake love I began to listen more of their songs but some songs were quite dissapointing. I listen to rise of bangtan only from 3.00 to 3.20 junkook part I think. I need you, Born singer(one of my favorites), Fake love, DNA are few of their best songs. From OST I liked even I die, it's you by Jin and V  3. SHINEE Actually shinee is my second favourite they also have many beautiful songs and their songs are full of rhythm and I really like it. View, Lucifer , Tell me what to do songs and The story of light ep 1, 2, 3 album songs are really beautiful and also shinee key relesed his album (Face album) last year and the songs are really pleasent to hear(also rip jonghyun)  4. EXO Exo also have many beautiful songs and really popular group. I don't like them much but some of their songs are quite beautiful and addictive. For an example lotto (lol) but I really like their Love shot album (love shot and trauma only)2 songs and from tempo album tempo and gravity also from countdown album loving you more and electric kiss and black pearl song is also beautiful. Ost are really good (chen ft punch everytime and chen beakhyun for you (scarlet heart ryo))  5. The boyz Actually I didn't have option for this place I thought putting txt but from their first album I only liked main song then thought about putting wanna one , nct but I don't like them much nct is a talented group but most of the songs are same style I only listened to paradise, limitless and trigger the fever also I only listend to wanna ones energetic and light. I started to listen to thr boyz few months ago and got really fond of them. Still didn't get time to see what are the songs in there album but got fond of No air, Giddy up, Right here, Boy, Keeper. What impressed me is their mr removed are really really stable and good chreogrphy also good too. Hope their new album will be a great one:)  ",

BTS i love BTS\u2019s music because well, it\u2019s the complete opposite of Stray Kids. my favorite album my them is Love yourself Her, which consists mostly of really soft songs. if i need to cry, i always listen to Epiphany or Euphoria. i love the MOTS album, and Home is a bop. they also make a lot of their music, but i\u2019m not sure if they actually produce all of them (like Stray Kids). i really appreciated that yoongi wrote / produced his solo mixtape. ~aria louise ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite kpop group, and honestly the only one that i stan with my entire heart is BTS. These hardworking, humble and talented angels put a smile on my face every. single. day. When my family asks if i'm smilling to my phone because i'm talking to my boyfriend it's always because i'm looking at a picture or video of BTS. They make me happy in a way that nothing else except my best friend can. And since she is also an ARMY, 80% of our conversations are about them. Their music makes me sing, dance, smile, laugh, cry, scream my lungs out while jumping around the house. I know their lyrics, their choreographys, i have thousands of photos and videos of them on my phone, all of their songs, even the covers. BTS are present in every part of my life. My ringtone is a BTS song. I wake up everyday to a BTS song. I fall asleep everyday to BTS songs. Even my damn credit card password is BTS related. And what i love the most about them is their personality. Even tho they are so famous, they're still the most humble people i've ever known. And they're SO hard working. They deserve the fucking world. I found out I had depression (i still do) a few months after I fell in love with them. And honestly if it wasn't for them (and my best friend) i would probably be dead by now. These seven boys give me a reason to wake up and get out of bed everyday. To keep trying. To keep fighting. To keep living. To be 100% fucking honest i would die for these boys because they saved my life.          ",

You'll get the more rebel, free and almost going against the grain kind of kpop that focuses on hip hop like BTS, B. A. P, monsta x, stray kids, ikon. (nct is like refined form of this style) The legendary big bang, 2ne1, girls generations, super junior, tvxq, jyj, boa, rain, Lee hyori. Some groups are equally popular for the personality as they are for their talent like mamamoo, btob, got7, twice, hilight. The bands like the rose, Day6, F. T island, drug restaurant. The exceptions like winner and vixx-good Quality, different aesthetics. If you wanna support some lesser popular groups or some younger groups, there's ohmygirl, pentagon, A. C. E, April, loona, wjsn, gwsn, sf9, nct dream, the Boyz g-idle. There's only one co-ed fixed group which is KARD. Of course there's more but way too many to mention all.

STRAY KIDDSSSS Now here are my reasons: Their songs- lot's of people say that there music is JuSt NoiSE but that couldn't be farther from the truth. If you listen to like Ex, Another day etc. You'll know that their songs aren't noise. And maybe this is my western side but, I personally love the \u2018noise' type songs like God's Menu and clearly lots of other people do too.3RACHA- the most talented people in kpop. Period. 3RACHA make most of their songs. Changbin and Han are the best rappers in kpop. (Once again period). Bangchan is an amazing singer,dancer,performer, leader and basically person so yeah.Their dance line- THERE DANCING ARE AMAZING AND MESMERISING.SINGING- every single one of them can sing beautifully. P e r i o d. But, Seugmin and I.N are incredible singers and should be acknowledged more.They are so funny- i guarantee you cannot watch one Stray Kids interview without laughing. Try it now.If these points aren't enough look at these boys  Thanks for reading ~Felix's Egg~ ",

Okay so try stanning: NCT - they're really talented and although there are a LOT of members, it's worth it because they're all so handsome and cute/hot, plus the sub-units produce a LOT of songs so you'll never have to wait long for a new album!!GOT7 - their vocal line is beautiful and their songs range from upbeat pop to aesthetic ASMR to Christmas-y plus the group is really funStray Kids - they're a true family and they should totally have a reality show, they're so hilarious, also the members are pretty easy to distinguish (at least for me)ITZY - they're a rookie group but they're super talented and hard-working and they've had a lot of success with their debut song, DALLA DALLA, and their more recent song, ICYTWICE - they're cute and fun and girly and they are really popular in Korea, also their songs are quite iconic in the kpop world (SIGNAL and TT were HUGE)Blackpink - their concept is, unlike TWICE, more tomboyish; although they can be adorable, they tend to lean towards being hot, girl-crush material. Their songs are also AMAZING (although they do NOT have enough songs to satisfy me lol)I'm pretty sure you already know about BTS, so I'm not even gonna name them (I was debating whether to include Blackpink, but decided why not). Anyway hope that helped and don't get mad at me for not naming certain groups!! ",

The top ones are these. Not based on popularity but on how talented and well rounded they are. They arent in any specific order. 1.BTS It's no lie that bts are a completely well rounded group. They have the highest scale performances in kpop out there. One of the best rappers with a sick level of flow and beat. Their vocals are extremely strong too. And dont get me started on their dancing. 2.Stray kids More than half of the group actually had dancing experience in the past. More than half of the groups are rappers. And the vocalists they have are HELLA good. 3.Ateez They are seriously being slept on right now. Their dances are the best I have seen in kpop. Their vocalists have voices that...are out of this world. Their rappers are known for their flow. 4.Twice Twice is one of the group that people call talentless a FUCK lot. But just because they never showed their whole potential it doesnt make them non worthy. Chaeyoung is a rapper who writes her own lyrics but never gets much recognition for that. She has the flow but jyp never let's her show that. They literally known for not having any weak dancers and having dance breaks that shock their audience every single time. Their vocals are more than just soulful. Just because of their pitch, one cannot judge them. And the technique they use is a brilliant one too. ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to list down the bands which suit my music style, hence might be a little biased. So here goes the list ; 1.Infinite :(my bias band I can't miss them hehe) Knife like choreography, 99% synchronisation,top notch vocals,often leave fans wondering if they \u201cate their CDs?!\u201d(that's how awesome they sound live). Hard work is their first name! And bonus: witty memebers and Greek god like visuals even if you're not a fan of them, just watch their reality shows and you will be head over heels with them xD My fav songs: everything honestly, but to name a few one day, chaser,btd, love letter, nothing's over, love of my life, can you smile. And on a side note, have you come across a band and a fandom who diss each other?! That's us, we love each other soooo much and that's the way we show it ;) With their 7th anniversary just around the corner, INFINITE has been one the finest and most successful band in Korea as well as overseas with a strong and thick fanbase, with them even being nominated as the representatives of hallyu wave for the year 2016  2. B1A4 : my second fav band,their vocals are just awesome,something which is rarely found in k-pop. My fav songs : A lie(in my everyday playlist),Solo day, sweet girl, what's happening, lovely 3. SHINee: They played a major role in spreading the hallyu wave and it was bcoz of their catchy songs. My fav songs: ringdingdong, Jojo, boys meet you,everybody,1of1 And their bromance with infinite is just so so sweet, I mean just look at this awwww  Other bands like winner, bigbang, sechskies, monstax k.a.r.d, c.n.blue,block b,apink,clc, are worth checking out ",

(Daesung- Singing/Variety Shows TOP- Rapping/Acting \u2026Taeyang and G-Dragon- One of the most whole-rounded kpop idols IMO) Even though the Seungri Scandal (which shows how deceptive and evil people can be under their nice exterior- this which made me disgusted at him) However, it shows that many text messages had been forged by SBS if I am not mistaken. 2ne1- I am shook at their stage presence! I love their songs and they are really talented. I am really sad about the disbandment but they came back on their 10th anniversary and celebrated it! I love their solo songs and will continue to stan the individual members in their solo careers!! (Although I am really angry at YG for not letting CL debut in America and not allow her to get interviewed) Winner- I love their songs (even though Cross and debut eras are my favourites) They are versatile and can do many genres! They are really really talented. You can watch millions of their performances every and smile again. They make you feel far from empty. Their songs are not soso, they OMG awesome! ",

            "answer_text": "Hai, i was kpopers, back when kpop was hits in 2010. I get that you already has many people recommend you to BTS or other groups that popular nowadays, but i\u2019ll give you another one, that you totally regret for not knowing them when you still learned about kpop hehehe.So, i'm going to recommend you this boygroup you really need to know (from 2nd gen ofc). They are Beast/Highlight B2st or Beast was boygrup from Cube Ent. they debuted in 2009, with six people (from top left: Dongwoon, Doojoon, Yoseob, Hyunseung; bottom left: Junhyung, Gikwang)  But in 2016, Hyunseung left the group. then in 2017 the 5 remain boy made decision that they would left the agency, but bcs of some disagreement, the boy can\u2019t use their group name, so then they build their own company, Around Us Ent, and change their name to Highlight (was also the name of their recent song that time).  actually i\u2019m not into kpop after 2013 or so, but up until now i still root for them (Just two bands, Super Junior and them!) i personally would recommend \u2018Fiction\u2019 or \u2018Good Luck\u2019 for starter, bcs i think that it was their best M/V and dance. if you into ballad, you can try \u2018On Rainy Days\u2019 or \u2018Will You be Alright\u2019, for fun song \u2018Beautiful Night\u2019 or \u2018Plz Don\u2019t be Sad\u2019 And fact, they ranked as the stable male group along with Shinee and Infinite, the three of them called Shi-Bea-In. Beast/Highlight also one of the group that billboard recommended for best group you should know in 2015 article (spoiler, the most of that recommend was 90s group) Along with this recommend, i should tell you sad news too, recently the sex scandal that also involved Seungri Bigbang, made Junhyung left Highlight, bcs he admitted that he know about it, and feels sorry for not thinking that it would make a big problem. (Sad sad info, Junhyung is writer, producer and excellent rapper of group) they all now enlisted to military. and will be back in 2020 i think, maybe with just 4 members left. as the old boyband, they won many award, well mannered, cute when in fact they all almost hit 30 ._., they have loyal fans and not toxic i think. So, if you don\u2019t know them, give it a try, you would\u2019t regret. (from former kpopers, to just stan Highlight & SuJu) ",

Chaeyoung got me feeling some sort of way ;)))  NCT 127 One of the best. I tried to get into the rest of NCT but just can't. Jaehyun \u2026 omg Jaehyun can run me over  BIGBANG Fantastic Baby was literally my very first K-pop song, I didn't know it was K-pop but that song was just too good. BTS were the ones who got me into K-pop but these guys, some of there songs really stick to me. And will never be forgotten.  BlackPink Their songs are really catchy. But some days I'll be honest, some days I hate them. Some days I love them. It's an on and off. Not a Blink, I tried just can't for some obvious reasons. Anyways Jisoo.. I live just to see her omg  KARD I recently just got to know them and honestly.. they're one of the best. I'm in love with the female and Male K-pop group idea, it's amazing. Their music is just Soo..  LOONA I fell in love with Butterfly. Their vocals are absolutely beautiful. I'll try to get to know the girls  STRAY KIDS Felix.. oh Felix.. From the first time I listen to his deep ass voice I knew this was some good ass shit. Turns out my instincts were right \u2026  Aaand many other groupss I listen to a shit load and won't ever mind any new recommendations ",

            "answer_text": "Yay for the answer request - people gonna say BTS, so I\u2019m gonna do some non-BTS ones. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Stray Kids Debuted in 2018, they came from a survival show, SKZ is very unique, because the members were put together by their leader Bang Chan, and they mainly rely on their self-producing (Han, Changbin and Chan have producing credits on 99% of their songs). They won multiple ROTY-awards, have a crazy amount of songs already 30+ in 1,5 years, dabbled into multiple genres. They have stable vocals, powerful main dancers, and one of the strongest raplines in the entire k-pop industry. Fun fact: if we count every rapper SKZ has 6 rappers.  Members are: Woojin, Chan, Minho (Lee Know), Changbin, Hyunjin, Han (Jisung), Felix, Seungmin, I.N (Jeongin)  They are adorable, funny and weird, did a lot of cool stuff, like walked on NYC Pride, and are generally really considerate and sweet idiots. Also fandom is called STAY, mainly international, but luckily they are slowly gaining popularity in SK too. Monsta X Sweet, woke and amazing members.  MX has one of the strongest visual as a group in the entire kpop, often performing in revealing clothes - however this is really not why they should be stanned. Kihyun is probably the best male main vocalist as of now (don\u2019t hate me other fandoms), who also happens to be ridicolously stable while doing MX choreos (which are not easy), and the rest of the vocal line is great too.  Their rapline: Joohoney (Jooheon) and I.M (Changkyun) may only be two people but holy they are a force to be reckoned when it comes to rap. Jooheon is often considered to be the best idol rapper right now, and well, it\u2019s either him or Stray Kids Han/Changbin. Their dance line: MX as a group is really synchronized. Members: Shownu, Wonho, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, Jooheon, I.M iKON They are very underrated and deserve more love. I don\u2019t want to talk about the Hanbin thing - I\u2019m just gonna say I miss him badly.  iKON has pretty decent title tracks, but why I fell in love with them are their b-sides, which have songs like this masterpiece:  Fandom is called iKonic, members are: Bobby, Jay, Ju-ne, Song, DK, Chan, (and B.I who used to be their leader, but was forced out by YG.)

THE BOYZ they\u2019re underrated. alot. they have lots of talent, incredible vocalists, dancers and rappers. check out their performances on MNET\u2019s Road To Kingdom, because they\u2019ve done breathtaking stages! songs i recommend: The Stealer, Salty, Bloom Bloom. VICTON i fell in love at first sight. i love their personality and they don\u2019t fail to make me always laugh. the vicuals are-\u2026wow-. they\u2019re an amazing group formed in 2016. i personally consider Seungsik (main vocalist of victon) one of the best vocalists out there. some of you migt recognize Han Seungwoo and Heochan from Produce X 101. Songs I recommend: Nostalgic Night (bop), Time of Sorrow and Howling. ",

They are the only kpop group (i think) that has different size of members and i love it! I really enjoy myself watching every variety shows that they in and definitely laugh like a lottt while watching the shows. And their songs are so special to me because it have their own uniqueness. To think on how much they struggle in the past since most of them came from a poor family and seeing them for who they are now, for what they achieve really make me so proud of them \u2764\ufe0f 2. Shinee I started to like shinee because of minho, i knew him from the drama that he acted. It breaks my heart every time i think about jonghyun, he is such a perfect guy with a perfect vocal! But shinee will always and always be 5hinee. And taemin our maknae is a perfect dancer! I really love to see him dance, and his dance in Move is totally perfect! 3. Exo A real definition of visual, like how can they all be so handsome?!?!!! And their vocals and dances are so amaaaazing! And kyungsoo despite being a shy type of person, he\u2019s a really good actor and his voice like omg! 4. Infinite They are just woww! Their voices their dances their songs are all amazing! Idk but i think that they are a little bit underrated, i mean that they don\u2019t have many viewers on youtube despite being so so good! But yeah you can\u2019t really judge a group based on their viewers on youtube. 5. Cnblue My most favourite korean band. No words can describe how good their performances are. Yonghwa\u2019s voice is absolutely dabomb! 6. Blackpink My badass girls. Their mvs their songs their vocals their dancing are so perfect! And they are all so cute especially lisa \u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there!! Kpop is one tricky thing, there are always new artists debuting and everyone is unsure of who to stan and who to support and whatnot. However, I will definitely say Stray Kids are ABSOLUTELY one group you should support and I will tell you why. Stray Kids are a group of 9 boys: Kim Woojin (the oldest), Bang Chan (the leader), Lee Minho (Lee Know) Seo Changbin, Hwang Hyunjin, Han Jisung, Lee Felix (Yongbok), Kim Seungmin and yang Jeongin (The youngest/Maknae) These boys went through a survival show called Stray Kids in which they worked so hard in but unfortunately lost Lee Know and Felix during the show (for ridiculous reasons) however, the remaining 7 boys carried on with the survival show in which a couple of other members like Hyunjin and Jisung were at risk of elimination. Later on in episode 9 of the survival show JYP brought Felix and Lee Know back and Stray Kids had to do a performance on stage as OT7 and OT9 and then the public decided whether Stray Kids would debut as 7 or as 9. Fortunately, 96% of the public voted for OT9 which i was so happy about because all of the boys worked so hard. Stray Kids make relatable songs talking about societal struggles and dealing with mental health issues such as Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia since the members too have struggled with mental health issues. Chan the leader does a Vlive once every week to talk and to play people`s favourite songs since he knows people struggle to sleep at night. Chan has such a beautiful heart and does and would do anything for STAY. he comforts his members, he helps out where he can and I can pretty much say that for each of the members of Stray Kids. Stray Kids are a self produced, self written, self made group in which Chan chose each of the other 8 members by himself in which JYP did not even get to meet until the survival show. STAY`s write letter to the boys and they do the most beautiful and most humbling thing, they read the problems that their fans are facing and they use STAY`s letters to make songs and to deliver such a passionate piece of music or pieces of music I should say and help their fans overcome or get through any troubles. Stray Kids have won 13 ROTY awards in under one year and a half, they have been on America tours, Asia Tours, toured Australia and are coming to perform in multiple places in Europe e.g. England, Russia, Germany, France this month!! :) Stray Kids do not just feel like \u201canother boy group\u201d they are honestly like your best friends and family, they used to do Q and A sessions on Twitter and KakaoTalk and would respond, mainly Felix and Chan reply but the other members of course would too. Felix`s responses were so heartwarming he would call STAY`s love, darling and the most cutest of all Bubby! The boys get a lot of hate from people for no reason especially the leader Chan, even though those people know Chan would do literally anything for them yet they still hate and disrespect him, it would be so lovely to have more people come into the STAY fandom and help the existing STAY like myself give Chan and the rest of the boys as much appreciation, respect, care, love and support as we have already tried to give. Sorry for this being long but I just could not express my love and appreciation for Stray Kids in a minimal couple of sentences. I really hope you become a STAY and enjoy listening to and appreciating the boys as much as I do. #STANOT9 #STAN3RACHA. I also forgot to mention that Jisung, Chan and Changbin formed a group called 3RACHA before Stray Kids existed and the make awesome songs like P.A.C.E, WOW, Placebo, Domestic Banana, For You, Matroshyka, Runners High, Double Knot, ID:a, Cloud -9, Broken Compass, NXT 2 You, Zone, 42. 3RACHA does the majority of the composing, writing of the songs but the other 6 members take part in it too.

            "answer_text": "Day6 This band. I thought I couldn\u2019t love a group more than BTS, but then I found Day6. And it\u2019s not that I\u2019ve given up on the BTS boys (not even close). I\u2019m still a full-blown army. But since diving into Day6\u2019s music, I\u2019ve discovered a depth and rawness that isn\u2019t often encountered in Kpop or American pop music. Day6 writes most of their own songs, and one of their members, YoungK, writes almost all of their lyrics. As a result, they have a very distinctive sound and lyrical presence. It\u2019s a band, so they all play instruments. Their talent is incredible! And of course, they are so funny. Their members are always making My Days (their fangroup) smile. Stan talent! Stan Day6! Loona One of the most underrated and unique girl groups out there in my opinion. They debuted in 2018, after months and months of hype. In fact, it was one of the coolest marketing strategies I\u2019ve ever seen in Kpop. Basically, Loona was like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re not going to be a girl group that maybe ends up having a couple solo artist projects in a few years. We are ALL going to be solo artists FIRST, and then we\u2019ll come together to make something even better-a girl group comprised of crazy talented, *individual* artists.\u201d So that\u2019s one of the fundemental concepts of Loona. Prior to debut, each of the 12 members debuted separately with their own solo tracks. Additionally, subgroup tracks were released. Because of this strategy, Loona already has a huge track list, despite having only debuted last summer. If you like innovation, you\u2019ll def like Loona. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I have two groups I stan: EXO, my main group, and GOT7. - EXO  Buckle up, because I have a lot to say about EXO. EXO was the group that introduced me to K-Pop. Before EXO, I was a lil dumb shit who assumed that K-Pop = BTS. I discovered EXO's Chen through a drama OST and fell in love with his voice. I decided to check his group out, just so I could hear him sing more. Lo and behold, EXO had a Chinese subgroup. I was shocked, as I thought K-Pop groups were, well, strictly Korean. And it happens that I'm Chinese, so their Chinese songs were very enjoyable to listen to. The Chinese members were relatable in a way, I guess. I told myself I would only listen to EXO-M. If you're an EXO-L, you know that it's impossible to stan only one member/subgroup/etc. Migrated to stanning the whole of EXO. Best damn decision. EXO's vocals, imo, can't be matched. No other group's vocals are powerful as theirs. I find all of their songs bops, even the non-title track ones. They also release a wide range of songs - pop, R&B, ballades, etc. I can always listen to EXO no matter what mood I'm in. Briefly mentioning their close bond as to keep the answer short. Haha. It's not short. - GOT7  Let me talk about their relationships. They. Are. Super. Close. They're brothers from different mothers. You can tell by the way they act that they aren't faking it. They're super entertaining to watch. Trust me on this. They're very kind to their fans, and always keep an eye out for them. Jackson once bought a bunch of water for the Ahgases (fans) who were standing outside for them on a hot day. Many kind acts. Bops. Some of their songs are whole ass bops. They mainly release trappy/poppy songs. When I'm in the mood, there's nothing better (maybe except for EXO, hehe) to listen to. - Thanks for the request! Hope you enjoyed. :) ",

            "answer_text": "As a fan of different k-pop groups all at the same time, it\u2019s pretty hard to pick a favorite. For context here\u2019s the list of K-pop groups that i listen to BTS, EXO, NCT(including the sub-units NCT U, NCT DREAM, NCT 127 & WayV ), Straykids, SuperM, BlackPink, ITZY, Twice, Red Velvet, CLC, Everglow, and other artists like IU, AgustD, Wonho, Taemin, Baekhyun, etc. Now that you\u2019ve seen how many groups i listen to and if you have listened to as many as i have, it is pretty difficult to pick a favorite out of these many groups, cause each of them has their own style of singing, rapping, and performing. If you make a playlist of their songs, you could listen to so many different types of music or, should i say k-pop in the span of just 20 songs. But if i had to pick a favorite out of these, i would say i\u2019m a little biased towards EXO, cause i\u2019m drawn towards vocals and EXO is best at it, not that the other groups have really good vocalists, but each of them has their own style and each style corresponds to a different mood, for example BTS is for relaxing, EXO is for more upbeat, NCT if i want to party, Red velvet, CLC, Everglow, Blackpink, ITZY, etc for more mature and sassy kind of mood, Twice just makes me happy, and others are just for time-pass or if i had to do some kind of work of some kind of work or other. And yeah that\u2019s how i would describe my favorite groups. and if you guys want to check out a playlist for all their songs, you could at the link below K_POP_ARCHIVES, a playlist by Abhinav Bammidi on Spotify this is my personal collection of all the songs that i like, make sure to check it out ",

            "answer_text": "90% of the answers are about their favorite kpop groups, not their names oops. anyways, one of my favorites are: TXTthey mean tomorrow x together or tomorrow by together and the concept just makes me happy, it\u2019s really cute and when you think more deeply of it it\u2019s also touching because it also means that they\u2019ll be together tomorrow, the day after, after that, forever. it\u2019s just.. wah. 2. BTS it stands for bangtan sonyeondan, and it means bulletproof boys. with all the fame comes hate, and they prove that they don\u2019t get the hate to them, especially not when their fandom army are guarding them too <3 3. Stray Kids the boys themselves thought up the name and that fact just makes me feel more closer with them. they\u2019re basically saying they\u2019re unique kids, straying from the stereotypes that most people have for kpop. they\u2019re amazing. 4. A.C.E i can\u2019t leave a.c.e out. a.c.e stands for adventure calling emotions, which in deeper detail is about the five members of a.c.e wanting to urge someone to have an adventure achieving their dreams. it\u2019s nice! i love how they took consideration to want to make people achieve their dreams. their fandom choice is also called choice because they are a.c.e\u2019s first pick. it\u2019s really cute. i remember having theories on what our fandom name was going to be, and it was so fun. the end result was still amazing despite us being wrong haha ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! I love love love K-pop. I just recently got interested in the genre of music this summer but these are my favorite groups: Male Groups Monsta X\u2014 this is my ult group, and the group is consisted of 7 members but most of the groups I stan are made up of 7 members which I find a funny coincidence. But the seven members are \u2026 Shownu, the leader, main dancer & lead vocalist The main vocalist, Kihyun Lead dancer & vocalist + visual, Wonho Vocalist and visual Minhyuk Vocalist and other lead dancer + visual Hyungwon Main rapper, vocalist Jooheon Lead rapper, vocalist & maknae I.M And here I grant you the 7 visuals, vocalists, and rappers and most importantly the 7 gods that make up Monsta X. But this of course is coming from a Monbebe so if you don\u2019t agree then that\u2019s ok with me. But moving on, the rap line for Monsta X is crazy, so that\u2019s why I gave them gifs instead of pictures. Jooheon and I.M\u2019s charisma is sensational and their stage presence is always full of energy and vigor. The vocal line for MX is also very special; the main vocalist, Kihyun has the most beautiful voice. His high notes are always a success, and the way his voice runs over notes in songs are so pretty to me. His voice is my favorite ever, and that goes for all artists I listen to, Western or Korean. Shownu\u2019s voice is sweet, and soft and elegant. He has great voice control, and whenever I listen to a Monsta X song I\u2019m always soothed whenever I hear his verse. Ah, Wonho. His voice is sultry, and raspy and deep and manlier than a manly man\u2019s. But it can hit high notes, express sadness, and leave audiences dumbfounded. Wonho\u2019s voice is very beautiful, and I love listening to it while watching the lyrics meanings because it always sounds more beautiful when the words are full of meaningful sentiments (which most times, they are). Minhyuk\u2019s voice is so cute. I find his voice to be the most calm out of the whole vocal line but also the one that has the most passion (besides Kihyun\u2019s) if that makes sense. Idk, whenever I hear him sing I just hear a lot of emotion or attitude or sass. His voice always stands out. Hyungwon is like that one vocalist in the group that never gets enough lines, if any. But that\u2019s the worst part because his voice is honestly the most distinct (to me at least) in the group, but maybe that\u2019s because I barely hear it so when I do I\u2019m usually like \u201coh yup that\u2019s my baby Hyungwon!!\u201d But in 2018, many Monbebe are rooting for Starship to give Hyungwon more lines because he deserves it, but the fact that in most performances he\u2019s center stage because he\u2019s a lead dancer makes up for it. He\u2019s also a DJ/producer and in his pre-debut days he was a model. But that\u2019s about it for my ult boy K-pop group Monsta X. I\u2019d say a lot more about the members as individuals and them as a group, but then that\u2019d take too long so I\u2019ll just move onto other groups I like (p.s, Monsta X is the only group I love, other groups I like lol). SF9 I got into SF9 a few months after finding Monsta X and it was from their song Easy Love that I found them. Afterwards, I just kept watching more and more MVs and that\u2019s how I became to be a Fantasy. SF9 stands for Sensational Feeling 9, and there are nine members with five of them making up the vocal line and the leftover 4 being the rappers. The leader is a rapper, Youngbin, and the vocal line is \u2026. InseongTaeyangJaeyoonRo WoonDawonAnd aside from Youngbin, the three remaining rappers are the maknae, Chani, whose voice is scary deep for his age (he\u2019s 17!!!), the main rapper Zu Ho (my bias!) and Hwi Young. I love SF9 mostly because of their music, although I do love them as individuals very much. They also really love us Fantasies and always make special MVs or extra clips for us. SF9\u2019s music varies a lot, and their latest comeback O Sole Mio is unlike a lot of K-pop songs. I feel like SF9 makes really unique songs with different beats and basses, their just so eccentric and electric (some of their coolest songs are Fanfare, ROAR, and K.O\u2014you should give them all a listen!!) They also have difficult choreo often with their songs, and their lives are consistently breathtaking and I love watching their old comeback stages from last year to their latest ones because you can see how much they\u2019ve improved and how far their getting. Each of their personalities are just super kawaii too. I hope that they each achieve stardom together as SF9. They also just debuted last year in 2016 so I\u2019m wishing that 2018 being their third year since debut brings many blessings their way. SF9 fighting!! #onceafantasy #alwaysafantasy  Top row L2R: (Zu Ho, Taeyang, Dawon, Hwi Young, Jaeyoon) Bottom row L2R: (Ro Woon, Youngbin, Chani, Inseong) And with those two groups out of the way and accounted for, there really aren\u2019t any other Kpop boy groups that I stan as hard as I do with these two. However I do listen to other groups such as Got7, BTS, KNK, Super Junior, TVXQ, JYJ, BIGBANG, and SEVENTEEN. I only know Got7\u2019s Fly, but it\u2019s one of my favorite songs. Jackson\u2019s swag is awesome, and I love Mark and JB\u2019s voice. For BTS, my bias is Suga and my bias wrecker is V and I love the BTS songs Fire, Blood Sweat & Tears, and I Need U. I only just learned of Super Junior by stumbling upon their song \u201cSorry Sorry\u201d from a concert Monsta X did. This is like a staple song in K-pop y\u2019all, everybody and anybody who likes K-pop should be put onto this song. \u201cSorry Sorry\u201d is one of the catchiest songs ever made!! KNK isn\u2019t a too popular group but I love their songs \u201cU\u201d and \u201cRain\u201d\u2014 their definitely worth giving a listen. The fandom name is super adorable too, we\u2019re called Tinkerbells! TVXQ was originally a group of 5, but eventually the group split into a duo, which kept the name TVXQ and the three members that left formed a trio, JYJ. TVXQ is the biggest legend in K-pop. This is something I will always believe and no one can ever tell me otherwise. Mirotic, which is the true staple song of K-pop, is a single that broke records on records on records. TVXQ as a 5 was everything. The members before disbandment, Yunho, Changmin, Jaejoong, Junsu and Yoochun were formidable. Their stage presence couldn\u2019t be denied and this is the one boy group in K-pop history that I feel like as individuals, the members were capable of everything that another was able to do. The high notes in their songs were breathtaking, the choreo was the most difficult I\u2019ve ever seen esp taking in that the songs they were performing along with it weren\u2019t made for low notes but mid to high ones, and despite all odds they made it. But enough about TVXQ as a 5, since that\u2019s old news that still breaks my heart but even separated, both TVXQ as a duo and JYJ are doing well. I also still love their songs and Mirotic was actually the first ever K-pop song I ever heard. BIGBANG is just an awesome group. Their songs are so hype and G Dragon is like just one of the most beautiful people to me; he\u2019s so effortlessly cool!! Daesung is also hilarious, I love his goofy personality. Seungri is another member too, and he\u2019s one of the most friendly idols ever. Taeyang is the \u201csexy\u201d one in the group and him and GD are supposed to be enlisted into the military soon although BIGBANG won\u2019t disband but they will take a hiatus. BIGBANG fighting!! The last member, T.O.P is the oldest of the group and the maknae btw is Seungri. The only songs I\u2019ve listened to by BIGBANG are Sober, Fantastic Baby and BANG BANG BANG. I love every one of them!! I\u2019ve also watched their Weekly Idols on YouTube and seeing GD and Daesung dance to TWICE songs honestly made my entire month of December jolly. The last (but not least!!) group that I\u2019ve yet to mention that I like & listen to is SEVENTEEN. SVT has 13 members, and I don\u2019t even know half of their names. I only know S. Coups, Hoshi, Mingyu and The8. But before the year ends I hope to put a name to each of the faces unfamiliar. I love their latest song Clap, and Don\u2019t Wanna Cry. Their both very different songs but I love them both and listen to them everyday. I hope to become a good Carat and help support them. Fun fact: Monsta X and SEVENTEEN both debuted in 2015 and both groups are very very close. Just watch the fancams where they watch each other\u2019s performances! All the members of each group know almost all the words to one another\u2019s comeback songs (Monsta X to SEVENTEEN\u2019s Clap and SEVENTEEN to Monsta X\u2019s Dramarama). Their also pretty much brother groups and they both support each other a lot and get along very well <33 Partly the reason of why I\u2019m a Carat is because of how much MX seem to love and support SEVENTEEN. Ah! And before I go into the female K-pop groups that I like I also like the group NCT and their music. However I only know one song, and that\u2019s Cherry Bomb from the sub unit NCT 127. But it\u2019s a very cool song that has a lot of hot, handsome and very sexy and swag vibes to it. I hope to hear more of their music! Girl Groups Since I\u2019m super tired of typing b/c of my overkill on male K-pop groups I like, I\u2019ll just list my favorite K-pop girl groups from the ones I like and listen to the most to least.

            "answer_text": "I stan many groups but my favourite and first kpop band I got into would be BTS, they are a 7-member boy band under bighit entertainment. Their english name used to be bulletproof scouts but now it\u2019s Beyond the Scene. They have 7 members, 4 vocalists and 3 rappers (however, sometimes they do exchange roles, because they are good at both) and they produce music.  This picture is from their repackage album, you never walk alone (they do have a new album coming soon). From left to right, Jin, J-hope, Jimin, Jungkook, Suga, V, Rap monster That is literally the most simplistic way I say it ^^ I will briefly introduce the members now. Jin a.k.a Kim Seokjin- He is the eldest member of BTS and he is well known for his flower boy looks and his very broad shoulders. He is a vocalist in BTS. J-Hope a.k.a Jung Hoseok- He used to be in a street dance group so he is very good at dancing, he is a rapper and he is very good at rapping very fast. Jimin a.k.a Park Jimin- He studied in Busan\u2019s top dance school so he is very good at different styles of dancing, he is well known for his abs. He is a vocalist and his voice is VERY high :) Jungkook a.k.a Jeon Jungkook- He is the \u2018Golden maknae\u2019 (youngest member) because he is good at everything. He is a vocalist too and he is known for his muscular body (trust me, when you see you, you\u2019ll understand) Suga a.k.a Min Yoongi- He is a rapper in BTS, he is known for his accurate pronunciation of words and he is also known as August D, which is his own rap songs. V a.k.a Kim Taehyung- He is a vocalist and is known for his deep soulful voice, and his 4D personality (he doesn\u2019t like being called that tho), he\u2019s just very funny and cute and clumsy, you can always tell it\u2019s him. Rap Monster a.k.a Kim Namjoon- He is the leader of BTS, and a very good leader, he always makes the prep talk for them and organises them. He can speak very good english tho and he is a rapper, sometimes he raps in english too. Hope this helps!! :) ",

I like many other boy groups but EXO is my ult group all around! I listen to many groups but I always come back to EXO. Their talent is undeniable. They are humble and respectable not only as idols but as people. They have been through so much as a group and are still coming out on top. And their visuals are no joke\u2026all of them are beautiful!!  #2 ATEEZ!! Rookies that are breaking through everywhere! These boys are amazing and talented and deserve everything they are getting through their hard work.  #3 NCT127/Monsta X!! I could not decide here because these groups are both so amazing! I literally love them both\u2026 I\u2019ve seen them both in concert and can\u2019t believe how hard they all work to make you feel amazed by their hard work.   Honorable Mentions: Pentagon - stop sleeping on their talent!!! Their rap line, Yuto and Wooseok, is amazing, talented (vocally and visually) people who deserve the world.  Oneus - Another rookie group who is so amazing!! Leedo, Ravn and Xion are my favs\u2026but the whole group so good together. It\u2019s mind-blowing how they are blowing up!!  SuperM - I mean how can you not mention this groups, I know everyone was so on the fence about this group, yes I was too! But they are amazing\u2026they bring so much to the table and they really look happy when they are together! Can\u2019t hate on that\u2026and I got to see part of my ult group on stage\u2026it was so AMAZING!!!  Girl Groups #1 Twice!! I love these girls so much!! They all work so hard and are so amazing!!  #2 Mamamoo!! They are breaking norms and I can\u2019t believe how amazing they are!!  #3 Itzy!! Rookies out here making themselves known.  I am definitely more of a boy group person and can acknowledge this. So again this only my opinion. K-pop is so amazing all around and all idols work so hard to make us happy. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you by band as band can be so easily mistaken for a group. I\u2019ll just answer both ways. My favorite kpop group is BTOB. Back when I only cared for Korean dramas and variety shows, I despised kpop. It was something that caused a small rift in my family. When I heard that they were incredible singers, I felt really doubtful and decided to hate them for no real reason. I don\u2019t know why, but something pulled me to watch to \u201cWay Back Home\u201d stage. It\u2019s difficult to listen to BTOB sing and deny their talent, but I somehow did. Months passed and I saw Missing You on YouTube. I listened and fell in love. The song was so different from the other kpop songs I hear everywhere. It felt so much more meaningful and deep. Ever since, I\u2019ve been obsessed with these loud, talented guys. My favorite band is The Rose. It was about a year after I started stanning BTOB. When you stan a group as talented as them, it\u2019s hard to be impressed by anyone. So there I was, unsatisfied by anything that wasn\u2019t BTOB. I heard that The Rose was extremely talented so I listened to \u201cSorry\u201d. My god\u2026 they were insanely good. While my heart doesn\u2019t go to them as it does to BTOB, they\u2019re definitely one of my favorite artists. Their songs, like BTOB, didn\u2019t feel factory-produced like most of kpop songs. It felt real. The emotions in the song was so heavy. It was exactly what I loved. So yeah, The Rose is now my favorite band. ",

            "answer_text": "Tough decision, but Day6. I got into them recently, before they did the \u2018one video per month\u2019 thing, but later than the album before this last one I explored their music more after that one \u2018day in the life of Day6\u2019 or that \u2018dorm room video tour\u2019 and I just kept clicking links to their songs\u2026anyway I fell in love, stanned almost instantly. It is truely rare for me to like every single song a group puts out, but here we are, loving every song and bopping when I get the chance. What attracted me most was their ability to actually PLAY their own instruments and sing while they're at it (their vocals and harmonies are no joke). Haven't seen that since CNBLUE. Their English covers are top notch too, I suggest that if you haven't listened to their cover of \u201cStop and Stare\u201d by One Republic (or any of the other ones) give it a listen. (Last reason I swear) I grew up on rock and rock subgenres, and pop music was another favorite, so those are key factors as to why I like them so much. Pop and rock mixed together?? Sign me the hell up. They also write a huge amount of their work, so bonus if you like groups that write their own stuff. (I'm sorry) This isn't the group themselves, but the fandom is chill (YouTube, as far as I know) and you don't see those \u201cC\u2019MON STREAM GET THIS TO THE MASSES WE NEED MORE VIEWS\u201d comments either. They all just sit and bask in their glory. ",

            "answer_text": "BLACKPINK- I love all of the four members, especially their show BLACKPINK House. My favourite member among them is Jisoo, what a cutie. For me, the group is able to pull off their \u2018girl-crush\u2019 concept well with both (in my opinion) a strong vocal and rap-line. That and I feel the genuine friendship amongst all the girls, which, in all honesty, is refreshing to see.  TWICE- Twice is definitely one of my favourite groups as of right now. I have a soft spot for all of the 9 members. I can't choose a favourite can you blame me? Recently I went through a hard time with one of my friends passing away, and Twice\u2019s bright music, personalities and smilies (as cheesy as it sounds) really helped me take my mind of it. I also love their side tracks. They're hidden gems, to be honest.  Seventeen- Seventeen is definitely one of my favourite boy groups. I guess my favourite would have to be Jeonghan. RIP long hair, You'll never be forgetton. Anyways, Seventeen\u2019s cheography, vocals and rap are just amazing, why wouldn't I put them on this list? Again, like BLACKPINK and Twice, you can really feel that genuine connection with all of the members and can see that they're close with each other.  It seemed like you were only asking for one group but I had a hard time choosing. Sorry. ",

            "answer_text": "my fav kpop group is bts. now im not gonna talk about their visuals or their underdog story but rather, i would say because they are artists themselves. (other groups too) im an emotional person and i find to like songs that are relatable to me. as we all know, bts writes lyrics that are delve and taboo topics and i respect them for their courage to speak up about these things. this made me a fan of their music. onto the artist themselves, i like their personalities. i love how each of them have different habits, how they love each other, how they appreciate their fans, and how humble they are. i also like the fact that they involve themselves in creating their songs which makes it feel like i have more connection to the artists themselves. i also like rap a lot so that\u2019s a given. i dont know if others also think of this but i believe that bts is one of the groups with the best rap lines. i like the fact that rm, suga, and j-hope has their own style and they are distinguishable even if you close your eyes. though the vocal line is not the best among all kpop groups, i still like them because their voices have different colors. jimin with his soft and high pitched voice, v with his low and deep voice, jungkook with his angelic voice, and jin with his sweet voice. (i recommend you to listen and watch the truth untold lyrics or just the audio itself and you can definitely differentiate and recognize their voices). all in all, i can say that they\u2019re my fav group because they are great artists and people. lets spread love and remember whar they always say \u201clove myself, love yourself\u201d.

A kpop group has a lot hard dance choreography and a kpop band plays instruments and doesn\u2019t dance. BTS, Twice, Ateez, Got7 are all kpop groups. Day6, Onewe, and The Rose are kpop bands. Ok, now that we\u2019ve sorted that out: My favorite kpop band is Day6. I also love N.Flying, The Rose, and Onewe. Day6: My Bias is Jae and bias wrecker is Young K. I would say my favorite songs from them are Time of Our Life and Man in a Movie.  N. Flying : Bias is Hun and my bias wrecker is Jaehyun. Favorite songs are Rooftop and Flowerwork is a bop!  The Rose: My bias is Woosung and bias wrecker is Jaehyeong. Favorite songs are Like We Used To and She\u2019s In The Rain.  Onewe: They are the band counter part to the group Oneus. Bias is Dongmyeong and bias wrecker is Kanghyun. Favorite songs are Regulus and Kousikondou. If you were wondering what my favorite Kpop groups are: AteezStray KidsBTSNCTGot7",

            "answer_text": "My top 10 would be: 10. BTS They\u2019re talented, hardworking and extremely kind to their fans. I personally really love the rap line of BTS, and also their visuals shocked me too. Also, most of BTS members can produce and compose music as well, and I don\u2019t think a lot know this fact. Now, I\u2019m not an ARMY, but I really enjoy their music and I love the fact that they love each other like family and always care for their fans. In fact, the reason why I started to like Kpop was because of BTS. Even though I don\u2019t stan them, I always support their music and follow their shows frequently. 9. GFriend GFriend is also in my top due to the fact that they are extremely talented and funny. We all know that they\u2019re incredible dancers, every. single. one. of. them. And they\u2019re really stable when singing and dancing as well, even though their dances are really hard. They're considered one of the most talented girl groups in the Kpop industry. Also, even though faced criticism, they still stand strong and be positive, and they worked even harder to prove those antis are wrong. 8. Seventeen Like GFriend, they\u2019re also awesome dancers. Most of their choreos are really hard to follow and need to have a lot of energy when dancing, so I seriously admire them so much. Like really, how can they dance like that while also being so stable singing it live?!?!?! Seventeen is extremely funny, really watch their reality shows :)) Not only that, Woozi in SVT can compose music - he actually composed most of SVT title tracks. Wow, talk about talents. 7. CLC They\u2019re very underrated despite being so talented and coming from a popular industry. After working for years, they finally got their first win with their newest song - NO. CLC composed of talents - dancing, rapping, singing, visuals, charisma. They have it all. And they worked extremely hard to promote themselves, not only as a group but as individuals as well. They frequently posted dancing videos (did I mention that they\u2019re all incredible dancers?) on Youtube and participated in shows, etc. CLC deserved more than just this. 6. EXO They have awesome music talents. I really love and admire the vocals of EXO as they can just do acapella out of sudden interests. Check out their videos on Youtube, you\u2019ll be amazed. The members are all good dancers as well. Really, EXO is full of talents. And really, you can\u2019t find a visual hole in their group, I don\u2019t even know who\u2019s the main visual in the group anymore :) But yeah, EXO is a combination of talents and visuals, definitely one of my favs. 5. Everglow I know that they\u2019re still new, but really they\u2019re one of the best rookies of this year. I love their debut song as well as their other songs in the album. And the fact that this group is full of visuals as well like Yiren, Sihyun, etc. They\u2019re all very talented, like every single member of their group is good in every position. They can all dance, rap and sing stable and are very well-rounded. And not to mention that they\u2019re very charismatic on the stage too. Definitely one of the very promising rookies. 4. Mamamoo Ah, the vocal queens! There\u2019s no need to argue about - Mamamoo is extremely talented vocal girls. And rap too. They are all incredible singers and have a wide vocal range (check out their lives) and they can easily switch positions from rap to vocal, from vocal to rap. They\u2019re also creative with their songs lines so that it will always be the original. They can just invent the words out on stage and it still fits with the music. (check out um oh ah yeah stages - they change their catchlines different times, different places) They\u2019re also really funny, carefree and kind to each other and their fans. 3. G-idle I stan them since their debut. The fact that the whole group is so talented that it\u2019s a crime :) They all can dance well, can sing lives stable and extremely, extremely charismatic. Really, see their up-close videos, it was just wow. The whole group is a pack - they\u2019re literally dinosaur rookies. Their songs and accomplishments are something most rookies can only dream of. Even though the whole group is really young (their leader is really 22 years old) and they already reached so many achievements that they\u2019re admirable. Their songs are super catchy and girl-crushed, it\u2019s hard not to notice them. And did I mention their visuals? 2. IOI I love them straight out of Produce 101. They\u2019re talented in every single field - from vocal, rap, dance to reality shows, charismatic, visual. They\u2019re seriously one of the best and biggest girl groups back when they still have their contract. They are also funny and welcoming, heart warmed and kind to their fans. To me, IOI is a perfect group and they could have been so much more famous now. Even though they only have 9 months together, their 9 months are a legend. Winning a lot of prices even though under a very short time is very impressive. And to this day they\u2019re still well-known even though under different groups and industries. All of their fans (including me) are still waiting for their reunion that we hope will someday come true. T.T Wanna OneI know, I have a habit of liking reality shows groups. :) It\u2019s weird really. But like, to me, Wanna One is perfect really. They have incredible vocal lines, cool rap lines, amazing dance lines, and an all visual group. They can produce and compose music, can play musical instruments and have many crazy individual talents. They\u2019re also extremely funny, opened, caring, kind, and hardworking. To me, Wanna One is very perfect and it\u2019s my best decision to stan them. Even though also a temporary group, they had incredible records - 101 cups they have won and so much more prizes - and they are considered one of the best rookies. It\u2019s a shame that they broke off too soon, but I\u2019m glad that they got put together and created an extremely talented, whole-rounded group. ",

If you asked me this question every year I\u2019ve been into K-pop, chances are I\u2019d have a different answer each time. Therefore, I\u2019ll give you my top 3 K-pop groups as of right now! The Boyz - LORD OKAY\u2026 I have stanned The Boyz since they wrapped up their debut\u2019s promotional period! I instantly fell in love after listening to \u201cI\u2019m Your Boy\u201d and have never looked back. The Boyz quickly became my ult group in a matter of weeks. They are such a versatile group, and that versatility extends past discography and into the group dynamics of The Boyz. It\u2019s been an absolute honor being a The B and having the opportunity to see them live at KCON NY! They put on a great performance and have improved immensely over the years. All of these attributes (and my love for Kevin) lead me to make this decision: TBZ is my favorite band!KNK - Coincidentally, today\u2019s KNK member Jihun\u2019s birthday! I got exposed to these clowns when I came across their teaser for their comeback title song \u201cU.\u201d Those 30 seconds (probably less) changed it ALL for me. KNK consistently produce BOPS with amazing vocals and performances. I\u2019ve also gotten the opportunity to see them live at KCON NY in 2018 and at their first solo tour in the States last year, on their 3rd anniversary. Needless to say, they never disappoint. Beyond their flawless discography, the KNK members are all literal COMEDIANS. Please take a couple minutes out of your day to watch a compilation of their antics, it\u2019s a guaranteed fun time!EXO - I think it\u2019s safe to say that EXO is that group. EXO are basically a household name for K-pop, and happen to be the first K-pop boy group I ever listened to! Years later, and I would still consider myself an EXO-L. EXO have an incredible catalog of music and are incredibly entertaining people. I always look back fondly on EXO as they are a group I have a lot of appreciation for, for leading me to the genre of music that has brought me to meet so many friends and to make countless memories.",

            "answer_text": "I used to have lot of favourite groups until I have seen an episode of Running Man. Episode 52- 6 members of SNSD were the guests and a couple race happened. After that episode I have watched all the variety shows Girls\u2019 Generation were a part of. (Star Golden Bell, Strong Heart, Family Outing, etc.). The girls are very funny and really good at variety shows.  Till then I only listened to Gee, I got a Boy tracks from SNSD. I was never wholly into Kpop (only Kdrama and Kshow fan) at that time. To see what the artist which is termed as \u2018Korea\u2019s National Singers\u2019 can offer me, I have started listening their tracks from the debut song Into the New World. By the time I reached Run Devil Run I became SNSD addict. I have 80 tracks of SNSD in my iTunes playlist which have a total play count reaching 1000. The only thing I regret in my life is not witnessing the rise and growth of SNSD. I am a new Kpop fan (discovered this amazing world in 2016) and I wish I have a \u2018Time Machine \u2018 so that I can go to 2007 and Stan this perfect group from debut.  To explain why Girls Generation is a perfect Kpop group there is a video which I watched recently on youtube- \u2018This is Kpop\u2019  All the things explained in the video for Kpop as a whole can be explained just using SNSD. (exclude extreme concepts like creepy, stellar level sexy) Singers - Taeyeon, Jessica (EX-SNSD member), Seohyun, Tiffany, Sunny Dancers- Yuri, Hyoyeon, Sooyoung, Yoona Rappers- Hyoyeon, Soyoung SNSD have songs in multiple music genre and tried all the possible concepts. All their members have a successful solo careers. Taeyeon- Solo female artist with 2 studio albums, Part of TTS Yoona- Popular actress with dramas and films in Korea and China Yuri- Actress in couple of dramas and variety shows Sooyoung - Model and Actress (drama currently airing) Seohyun- Female Solo Artist with a Studio Album, Part of TTS, Actress (drama currently airing) Sunny - Radio Shows, Variety Shows, Also has plans for an album Hyoyeon - Participated in dance variety shows, Has 2 singles Tiffany - Studio Album, Was a main cast of popular variety show (Slam dunk) Jessica - Solo Artist, Actress (In China) SNSD (Shoujo Jidai) also has a very good popularity in Japan. I personally like Japanese albums more than Korean ones. They also received a lot of awards and set many benchmarks (Not calling them records because a record is broken every day in the current digital world). I think SNSD is the epitome of every Kpop group and all the groups should strive to reach it to become legends So Girls Generation is my favourite artist and I am pretty sure that I am a sone forever. Jigeum-eun Sonyeoshidae!! Ap-eulodo Sonyeoshidae!!! Yeong-woni Sonyeoshidae!!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Okay then, even though I discovered K-Pop through BTS, I\u2019ve got to say, I LOVE Seventeen. I mean have you seen these thirteen wonderful boys? (actually they were supposed to debut with 17, hence the name, but 4 left, including Samuel, who is now a solo artist under Brave Ent.) They have actually released quite a few songs this month, such as \u201cLilili Yabbay - Performance Unit (Hoshi, Dino, Jun, The8)\u201d, \u201cTrauma - Hip Hop Unit (S.Coups, Vernon, Wonwoo, Mingyu)\u201d, \u201cPinwheel - Vocal Unit (Woozi, Jeonghan, Seungkwan, Joshua, DK)\u201d, and \u201cChange Up - Unit Leaders (Woozi, S.Coups, Hoshi)\u201d, and they\u2019re all such bops! They have such a good rhythm~ I am not ready for their new comeback omggg. Also, they have great personalities. Seungkwan being his loud, extra, and friendly self, Dino being Jeonghan\u2019s baby (they are honestly such cutiess omg my fangirl heart giewwig). And Woozi, the short, adorable bean that doesn\u2019t want to be cute (he\u2019s pretty scary actually, lmao he used a guitar as a weapon once). Oh and don\u2019t forget Joshua\u2019s slight obsession with Resse\u2019s Puffs (oh and since his name is Jisoo, many Carats have made this kinda old meme a while ago called \u2018you need Jisoos\u2019), and Vernon once looking like young Leonardo DiCaprio. This is what kinda lead me to stan Seventeen honestly hah, their amazing personalities and their interactions and cooperation with each other. And to think, they came from the bottom, to have to share one bottle of toothpaste with 13 people and rooming with each other, to all having rooms of their own\u2026 ;\u2014; very similar to BTS\u2019s story tbh\u2026 Anyways, I hope this was a good answer, and always remember\u2026 \u201cSlip in to the diamond life~\u201d P.S. No, the fandom name is not \u2018carrot\u2019 as Wonwoo once said with Hoshi\u2026 (well, most of the members pronounce it that way lmao).. The fandom name is actually Carat, like 24 carat gold. ARE YOU KIMBAP KIDDING ME (Seungkwan quote ;D)? I ALMOST FORGOT\u2026 Some of my favorite Seventeen related channels are LoliKitty and ftwseventeen. And I recommend watching Adore U (their debut song), Highlight (by performance team, you might hear a misheard lyric.. \u201cI\u2019m like a bird, not a turkey~\u201d), Shining Diamond, Swimming Fool, My I (omgsofreakinglittjwie), Mansae (mansaemansaemansae :)))), Ah Yeah (though it may be old, it\u2019s lit), and the English Time playlist on LoliKitty\u2019s channel (you won\u2019t regret it). Omg this answer is so freaking long, just tell me if you\u2019d like me to introduce you to the members if you don\u2019t know them yet <3 Much love~ edit: y\u2019all carats go watch clap m/v, it was released earlier today and its so littt :)) ",

IKON Similar situation with IKON. I love their personalities but severely miss B.I. listening to their music makes me want to cry because I miss him. 3. Seventeen They are the biggest group that I am into, and I love them! There music videos are always so pretty and they amaze me by getting every member in shot. My favorite group for performance by far. 2. BTS BTS was the first kpop group thar I ever got into and I love them all dearly. My Ultimate Bias is in BTS, Yoongles, and I listen to their music all the time. There is so much that I have yet to see and hear, and I hope that one day I can catch up with all the Run episodes. AteezMy babies! Ateez has got some of the prettiest music that I've heard from a kpop group and to tjis day, I am amazed by their voices and visuals. ",

            "answer_text": "I like many, but I love, respect, and admire EXID and Red Velvet. It isn\u2019t solely based on looks and choreography, but how they climb up the ladder to get to where they are now. Red Velvet\u2019s story isn\u2019t as poignant as EXID, but I love RV\u2019s personalities and chemistry, their songs are catchy and great, either in Ballad or Dance songs. These girls aren\u2019t as explosive as other popular girl bands in terms of popularity, but they keep the quality high every time they perform, you might have heard about RV members shivering on stage but keeps on performing, that\u2019s what I admire from them, their personal stories are fun to heard, too! EXID came back from the ashes. In 2012 when they debuted, songs aren\u2019t hitting the chart, some member left and formed another group. These happened for 2 years, Hani said in an interview on Happy Together, she even went to China to study because EXID wasn\u2019t popular, and she\u2019s about to gave up. But she realized she shouldn\u2019t let people dictate her dream, and because of Pharkil (fancammer), their title song Up & Down skyrocketed and topped charts even though promotion period ended. There was also a story where there was only 15 people came to EXID\u2019s fan meeting, including their families. Seeing them rising makes me respect them right away. Not that I discredit popular groups, but to witness a group persistent is something great. ",

            "answer_text": "As of November 2016, I currently stan 4 groups: EXO, GOT7, EXID and KNK. Most of you guys probably know about the former three, so I\u2019ll be introducing you to KNK. Here\u2019s an excerpt from Wikipedia about them. KNK (Hangul: \ud06c\ub098\ud070; RR: Keunakeun, lit. \"great\" or \"to be great\") is a five-member South Korean boy band under YNB Entertainment, the company's first male idol group. KNK is an initialism which stands for K-pop kNocK. They held their debut showcase on February 29, 2016 and officially released their debut single album entitled Knock on March 3, 2016. KNK\u2019s a relatively new group. The offical fanclub name is \u2018Tinkerbell\u2019, and according to allkpop, here\u2019s the story behind it. \"We were watching the movie 'Tinker Bell' and came to think that our fans are our tinker bells that protect us. So that's how the name was chosen.\" Yeah I know how cheesy that sounds. But I\u2019ll also admit that I first got into them because of their heights - KNK\u2019s average height is 1.85m. The tallest member (Seungjun) is 1.89m while the shortest (Heejun) is 1.78m. I repeat. THE SHORTEST.  Here\u2019s them standing beside Heechul in Weekly Idol. The member in the first pic is Seungjun. In the second pic - the order from left to right is Jihun, Inseong, Seungjun, Heejun and Youjin. Why is this so important to me? Well, my height is 1.75m. So I\u2019m taller than or around the same height as about 50% \u2013 80% of the members in any given male k-pop group. Imagine my pain when they give out interviews like \u2018My ideal type is shorter girls\u2019. And yes, I know I\u2019m being delusional but whatever, I\u2019m content with just the thought that I fit into my bias\u2019 ideal type. Except that it rarely happens. Why? Because I\u2019m 1.75 and get disqualified as soon as height is mentioned (read: very quickly). *cries* Nevertheless, KNK soon grew on me and now they are one of my favourite groups along with GOT7. They recently cameback with a song called \u2018U\u2019 but decided to promote without an MV. (Their lable said that the MV had low-quality). So here\u2019s their comeback stage at Inkigayo.  Apparently, the tinkerbell who subbed the video had same thoughts as me.   If you\u2019re interested to know more about KNK, as a start, I highly recommend watcing their weekly idol episode. They\u2019re all funny, charming, talented and dedicated hard-workers. All of their past singles are good too. KNK is a group that definitely deserves more recognition. TL;DR. WE HAVE TALL ASIAN MEN JOIN US. ",

I first heard about BTS when I was small, one if my best friends, who has known them since they started, she introduced me to them. I soon grew to be obsessed with the band. I do have a bias and bias wrecker, the thing is..they're both Yoongi (Suga). I know a lot of other bands like, TXT, NCT, NCT 127, EXO, STRAY KIDS, TARGET, TOO, BLACKPINK, Red Velvet, Girls Generation, Gfriend, MONSTA X, Kingdom Teams, ATEEZ, ect.

I know all the members, I know all their full names, and I know my favorite member, Huening Kai, height.

Bias: Ji-soo (I apologize if I didn\u2019t spell her name correctly) 4.Astro  Astro was the second boy group I enjoyed. Ugh\u2026their visuals kill me. Bias: MoonBin 5.Triple H  I was introduced into this group because of my love for hyunA. 365 Fresh is a bop. Bias: All of them..because why not 6. Red Velvet  Red Velvet is definitely my No.1 girl group. Cookie Jar was such a great song. Happiness is the best thing that my ears have experienced. Bias: Joy As for the two solo artist that I stan, they are hyunA and Sunmi. As I\u2019m wrapping things up I realized there are so many more groups that I like, but I couldnt include them because my list would be awfully long. But if you\u2019re curious they are EXO, Momoland, I.O.I, CLC, and NCT U. ",

            "answer_text": "Golden childThey are really underrated. And I don't stan them because of their visuals but because I truly believe that they are the most talented kpop group I've ever seen in my life. From strong vocals to amazing rap and dance skills. They can do it all. And their voices are all so unique and gorgeous. And not to forget about how they are the funniest group. And believe me I stan a lot of groups so I know what I'm talking about. They always make me laugh with basically everything that they are doing. 2. Victon Another underrated group. (I live for underrated groups, they are the best honestly) They are also very weird and talented and I like that. They just have this aura to make me happy idk. 3. The boyz Even tho I'm not a hardcore stan anymore, they are still one of my favourites. They have a lot of good songs are they are also a silly group. I feel like some members did change from when I last saw them. And sunwoo's actions aren't really doing them good atm. The reason that i don't really watch videos or listen to their songs anymore is mainly bcs of some \u201cfans\". 4. Cix Yes again, an underrated group. They are super cute and funny and i love all of their songs. And they are not problematic and just really peaceful (except from the maknae xD)& the fandom to. and I like that. ",

            "answer_text": "Oooh this is going to be a fun one to answer. Here\u2019s some of my only girl group ones bc I have too many and with boy groups as well it would take forever. My Ult bias (not a group, but for all of kpop) is Lee Ji-eun, or IU. You can\u2019t deny how kind she is, how much of a fantastic artist she is or her beauty.  My favorite girl groups include: Red Velvet. They are all so gorgeous and talented, and have such a range of musical diversity. (My bias is Irene)  AOA: They also are all beautiful and have a large range of musical styles. (My bias is Jimin.)  G(idle) They are so cool and honestly very intelligent (lots of bilingual members), and have had an amazing start for just being rookies! My bias is Yuqi.  Girl\u2019s Day: THEIR VOCALS ARE EVERYTHING. Especially in \u201cI\u2019ll be Yours\u201d which just lets all the members shine.  Loona: As much as everyone hates the people who constantly post \u201cstan Loona\u201d on everything, you should stan Loona haha. They have great vocals and dancing abilities, and their concepts are everything. (bias: Vivi)  Izone: AMAZING rookie start. La Vie en Rose was one of my favorite songs of the year, and you can just feel all of these girls amazing stage presences.

            "answer_text": "\u201cstan\u201d is a word i use very cautiously, lol. to me, to stan a group means investing your time into that group and giving the effort to learn their names, their backgrounds, and their overall story as a group. what i mean by that isn\u2019t remembering the exact date each of the members were born or even buying their merchandise, but instead, supporting them in your own way :). MY FAV GROUPS: Got7 members (l to r): Jinyoung, BamBam, Youngjae, JB, Mark, Jackson, Yugyeom  (2020 album: Dye) (title song: \u201cNot By the Moon\u201d) this group is so talented on so many levels. they\u2019re music is tasteful, the group\u2019s good looking, and most importantly, they, as in themselves, are good people. we don\u2019t know these idols in person, of course, but Got7 is known as one of the most down to earth groups in K-Pop at the moment. it\u2019s truly inspiring to see how humbly they present themselves, despite their fame. one person i\u2019d really like to point out is BamBam, their Thai member.  he\u2019s one of the three foreign members, and while i\u2019m not in any way disregarding jackson\u2019s or mark\u2019s troubles, it seems that the media has a particular liking to pointing out BamBam\u2019s ethnicity over everything else when he does something unfavorable. an example would be when he messes up the choreography, misses the beat, etc. (which is all normal stuff). haters do this to Lisa of Blackpink as well, and frankly, it\u2019s disgusting. but despite that mess, Got7 is full of good people with amazing personalities. i could watch videos like this of them all day:  2. Monsta X  members (l to r): I.M, Joohoney, Minhyuk, Hyungwon, Kihyun  (2020 album: Fantasia X) (title song: \u201cFantasia\u201d) i\u2019m pretty sure this album will be my favorite album of 2020. it\u2019s a little soon to say, but i\u2019m in love with the display! the colors, the aesthetic, and the vibe is just jaw dropping. Joohoney\u2019s part ^^ is a replay after replay all day, every day. it\u2019s just so smooth, haha. but apart from their amazing talent and staggering vocal ability, the group\u2019s personality is favorable as well! that seems to be a reoccurrence throughout this list, you\u2019ll see. the thing with that, though, is that if i take the time to learn their names and learn about them as more than \u201cMonsta X\u201d and really dive deep into the fandom, i would need to enjoy watching them. you know what i\u2019m saying? there\u2019s no point in watching a group i don\u2019t find entertaining. groups with big personalities like Super Junior, EXID, Exo, Got7, BIGBANG, f(x), etc. are enjoying to watch because i\u2019m constantly laughing along! anyways Monsta X is at the top of the list because they deserve to be. and go ahead and listen to their new album! it\u2019s really good! \ud83d\udc9b 3. G-Idle  members (l to r): Shuhua, Minnie, Miyeon, Soyeon, Yuqi, Soojin  (2020 album: I Trust) (title song: \u201cOh My God\u201d) finally, a girl group! honestly, i was never into girl groups as much i was into male groups because of a few things. the main reason was the song choices. the usual girl group song would be cute and sweet, and super high pitched. there\u2019s nothing wrong with that! but it\u2019s just not my go-to song style. anywho G-Idle is the first girl group i\u2019ve ever stanned :). their voices are incredible as well as the vibe they each portray. they\u2019re very fun to watch too, and i find them humorous lol. i\u2019m mostly interested in their music though. the song above is amazing and i\u2019ve been playing it on repeat since it came out a few months ago. the aesthetic they chose for this mv is almost mouthwatering. it\u2019s definitely my favorite mv of all time! and the girls look totally gorgeous as well. i\u2019d also like to point out Soyeon\u2019s voice- omg. it\u2019s just.. so cool. her rapping makes me wanna dance naked hahaha! no, i\u2019m just kidding, lol. but seriously, i love each of their voices! \u2014 so! to recap, i like Got7 because of their personality, Monsta X because of their music, and G-Idle because of their aesthetic. lol. nahh, i love G-Idle\u2019s music too lol! i\u2019m a huge fan of these three \ud83e\udd0d ",

            "answer_text": "\u2078I'm a fan of kpop for near 2-3 years but I stan many groups so I will put my top 10. This is my opinion 10.BTS Bts is amazing but there things I don't necessarily like about them.Fire is absolutely my favorite song from them since of how good it was and the beat slightly changed.Bts are amazing but not as the others on my list.But still I love them as an ARMY and not to be rude but they have a weak vocal line but strong rap and dance line. 9.Girls Day I really miss Girls Day even as a Daisy (Girls day Fandom) I really love their personalities with each other.They show off their sweet friendship with other idols like Hyeri and Ros\u00e9. My favorite song is Female President since they all showed off their beautiful vocals even Minah's high parts were amazing. 8.Super Junior Super junior are excellent but I really hated about what Shindong said.(I'm not sure if Its correct ShinDong commented, \u201cFor me, if you have to lose weight, then you should. Lose a little weight, can\u2019t you just manage yourself. If I say this, the other party will go \u2018Who are you to~\u2019 and I will say \u2018I\u2019m a guy and you\u2019re a girl\u2019.\u201d which is just sexist in my opinion. 7.Blackpink I really love them but I can't understand some things about them.Their songs are bomb but I didn't really like Ddu-ddu-du and how they have the same concept.I do respect them for how they are but I just can't get into them. 6.Twice Just like blackpink I love and appreciate them but the line distributions are a bit whack. The rappers don't get enough lines like bruh also I don't like those cutesy concepts.But I really respect them. 5.Red velvet I'm glad that Wendy is recovering very well but they really are amazing I don't hate them.All of the members are pretty and talented. As a Reveluv they sometimes lack in a few things. 4.Btob Btob (Born To Beat) are outstanding their vocals are the best.All of them could visuals and Vocalists since even the rappers are good. In my opinion they have one of the bestest vocal lines. 3.EXO To be honest I miss the members especially Xiumin but they also are amazing Obession was good and Sehun got more lines.But everyone can showcase their vocals on stages with songs like Sing 4 u or Lady luck. 2. (G) I-DLE Just amazing.I love them all and as a Neverland they all have amazing voices.Soyeon gives the members lines that fit them well.They have sweet songs like Maybe,Luv u,What's your name and What's in your house which shows everyone's vocals. 1.GOT7 They are crackheads everywhere,anywhere,any time even in front of their younger groups.They have a really peaceful fandom (IGOT7,Ahgase which means baby bird) and they care for us no matter what. No one is normal in the group not Mark(Marknae,Fake youngest) or Jinyoung(Eomma,Mother) even Jb (Memebum).Special mentions Bambam(Dabdab,weird,crazy,I go to school boi),Jackson(Noisy,Loud) Youngjae(Sunshine,Loud) or even Yugyeom(Laughs at everyone,savage,also loud) ",

I immediately fell in love with Minho when I saw him in the Korean drama To The Beautiful You and had to know more. So I googled him and found SHINee. I remember the first song from SHINee I heard was \u2018Hello\u2019 and that is still my favourite SHINee song to this day. Im not sure I can really pin point one thing that made me fall in love with them, but I did. I cant think of a song of theirs that I don\u2019t like, and i\u2019ve listened to their whole discography. The boys are a family and you can really see the love they have for each other. After Jonghyun passed i was terrified they may disband. and even though i would have supported them no matter what i would have been heart broken. Finding SHINee helped me in many ways. And even now when i am feeling down or upset their music, dramas, variety, and reality shows always bring me so much joy and happiness. I will always love them. ",

            "answer_text": "I listen to IZ*ONE the most. In their recent comeback which is Secret Story of The Swan is very very good. Their concept also has changed. Their songs in the past was linked with the flower concept. And now the flower concept has ended. Secret story of the swan is a very charismatic and elegant song. I'm actually not a fan of repeated chorus but I'm okay with this one. And, also their choreography, it is very pretty. They said that if we want to lost weight, we should just dance to this song \ud83d\ude02. So, if you like the song, please watch the dance practice too. Well, that was about their recent comeback. Now, it it about the song that I wanna recommend to you. If you like high beat songs, then I would recommend Up and Airplane. If you like emotional and slow beat songs then I would recommend Memory, Really Like You, You&I and lastly, Someday. Believe me listen to their voices will make your heart feel calm. So that's all. I would be very happy if you listen to my recommendation. No pressures tho. Bye, luv ya \u2764\ufe0f. ",

            "answer_text": "By far, VIXX. No doubt. Why? heres some reasons, concept kings. They almost never do similar concepts. They did 2017 Conception which was a 3 mv storyline about Greek Gods, kratos, hades, love potions, Zelos, Jelousy and desctruction. They have also been love slaves, traveled to ultimate peace in shangri la, been cyborgs, voodoo dolls and much more concepts in the last 6 years. much unique to many kpop groups. 2. Choreography. Their dances usally tell their stories in a powerful way. So strong and graceful. 3. Vocals.Anybody who doesnt think they can sing should check out live versions of Fantasy and Error. Watch them sing Shangri La on Dingo. Listen to Love Letter and all of their ballads. If you listen to all their songs it proves how well they can sing. Ken and Leo may be the main vocals but the others are no joke too. True vocal kings. 4. Ravi, the rapper. He spends most of his time and free time writing songs and lyrics for VIXX, and his own music that he has 1 album, and multiple mixtapes that he releases many times a year. His rapping is amazing. Most of them are songwriters and composers, But Ravi has by far done the most songs, Leo comes in at second. 5. They are silly and quite wierd, but they all have diffrent personalities. All are serious about work. N is the talkitive, kind of annoying leader who loves on everyone too much, praises himself too much, main dancer with the honey voice. Leo is the soft spoken one,eccept when hes singing, he can blow out your ears. He used to never talk but now hes very giggily and wierd, Loves hugging especally Ken. Ken is also the main vocal who sounds amazing while singing, but loves making strange noises, screaming and is the king of Aegyo. Acts like the maknae but everyone loves him. Ravi, Rapper, is silly and cute but looks tough, acts crazy when you dont expect him too, most seriousn when it comes to work. He loves Ken more then anything. Hongbin is the Visual with the brightest smile that will light up your whole world, deep singing voice, cringes at almost everything. Hyuk, the huge evil Maknae that loves throwing them to the ground, especally Leo. Powerhouse dancer. All loves their fans. This has been long but no words can explain how much I love these wonderful boys. They have made me happy many times.  ",

I know it\u2019s looked down upon but not gonna lie and say I\u2019ve stanned someone my whole life since I met them. Okay so first group that was my first ever favorite in Kpop, was superjunior. I fell in love with them after watching full house. A bit after that, while still loved Suju I also really fell in love with Kara..I reall liked their song Honey at the moment and Pretty Girl, but what made me love them and be one of my favorites is because I saw them on star golden bell, and I fell for Gyuri. Then I really took a liking for SNSD, I remember I was watching a video for wonder girls tell me to see what the hype over it was all about, and at that time you could add ppl as friends..anyways I went to this person\u2019s channel who commented on the video to send a friend request but they said in home page of their channel that they didn\u2019t want friends who liked SNSD..didn\u2019t know who they were at the time so I checked them out, I saw Kissing You, and fell in love with the song because it was so cute and it had Donghae\u2026and I really liked Jessica from the start, now although I didn\u2019t fell for Jessica how I fell for Heechul or Gyuri, I just really liked their songs, and though Taeyeon and Jessica were just so cute, and I loved their voices. Then I got disinterrested in Kpop..not much so the music but the fandom\u2026then I found BTS an really liked their songs, and well they were pretty funny, but stil was turned off b fandom in general (not bts fandom but kpop as a whole) if not for that I probably would have gone trough an obsession face with them..anyways despite the bad side of kpop every once in a rare moon I would check to see what\u2019sup, so I checked on infinite and went to woollims page and saw they were promoting a girl group, saw live performances of them and all, and really really liked them, loved their songs, and their performances, and even more I fell in love with their personalities\u2026so if it is who is my favorite at the moment, I would defenately say it\u2019s Lovelyz, even though snsd made comeback, and suju still around. At the moment I am all for my eight pretty princesses Kei,Jisoo,Mijoo,Yein,Jiae,Baby Soul, and Jin. ",

            "answer_text": "Right now I can confidently say it\u2019s Akdong Musician but I call them AKMU, consisting of brother-sister duo Lee Chanhyuk and Lee Suhyun.  They debuted 7 April 2014 with the song 200% (which is still my least favourite AKMU song, forgive me) after emerging the winners of Kpop Star. I have never watched it, but what I constantly hear is that they were excellent performers, so I might watch it out of curiosity. Over the years, they have never failed to improve more and more, and their sound always impresses me. Reasons why I love them: Their music doesn\u2019t fit the typical standard in K-Pop, they rarely have any tropical house or hip-hop. There\u2019s something about their sound that\u2019s so organic and refreshing. We have Chanhyuk to thank largely, resident songwriter and composer for AKMU\u2019s songs. The lyrics alternate between deep and thought-provoking to fun and light-hearted. And Suhyun\u2019s vocals are above average, she has a pretty powerful voice.They may not have the ideal appearance for K-Pop stars but I love them for how cute and unique their facial features are. I\u2019ve seen them receive flak for it, but I disagree that Suhyun and Chanhyuk are ugly. They are easily some of the most good-looking Koreans I have ever seen. What makes it even sweeter is how as brother-sister, you can clearly see their resemblance to each other.I can relate to them. As an older sister, I have younger siblings whom I love but at the same time am exasperated with. Hearing them talk about how they were when younger and recount past fights while laughing over it or when they interact with each other on variety shows reminds me of my own sibling relationships and how much they are like my family. It helps me establish a sense of closeness to them.Lastly, their music videos are the best I\u2019ve ever seen. \u2018Re-Bye\u2019 has a theatre themed storyline with a twist at the end which always blows my mind because I couldn\u2019t see it coming. \u2018How People Move\u2019 has a crisp, bright aesthetic and is my favourite music video. It includes Escher\u2019s stairs as part of the set-up. \u2018Melted\u2019 is the story of a boy struggling to make it in the world and brings tears to my eyes. It\u2019s all so good. There are many more but these are the highlights. I\u2019d recommend any person who\u2019s interested to hear their music, these tunes to begin with: How People MoveRe-ByePlay UglyMeltedDinosaurLast GoodbyeChocoladyTo end off, right here\u2019s a lovely image of all of them.  Particularly, an image of Lee Chanhyuk. Suhyun is amazing but he deserves more love.  ",

            "answer_text": "1: NCT I adore this group, I've been into Kpop for awhile since around the time they debuted but only found them last year. It hasn't even been a year yet since I joined the fandom but they are the first group that I know all of the members and can pin point who is who. I can't even do with western singers. 2: Stray Kids This group will make me cry I have so many feeling for them. From their survival show to their first year anniversary. Their lyrics are real and raw and so Relatable. 3: Super Junior As the Maknae has finally come back from his military duty it will be an amazing comeback when it happens. I can't wait. 4: ATEEZ When they first Debuted I couldn't get into them. But when they had their first comeback I was hooked, they've just comeback again and it's even better than the last one. 5: SEVENTEEN One of the first self-producing groups, their talent is outstanding. 6: TxT The brother group of BTS. They had so much pressure more than any other group really since BTS is a such a popular but they crushed it. I think they would have to be one of the only groups that had such a huge fan base before they even debuted. 7: AB6ix All except one of the members participated on Produce 101 s2. Only two went on to debut as Wanna one, Park Woojin and Lee Daehwi. They are amazing and talented and you'll fall in live with the members. There are so many awesome groups but those are my tops. ",

After carefully thinking it over, I\u2019ve decided my favorite K-Pop band is not from South Korea, but from North Korea: the Moranbong Band!  WHAT?! Why? My favorite K-Pop is from the 90s. North Korea\u2019s a couple years behind, and thus their music (for some reason) reminds me of the 90s.They play their own instruments! These days, many groups have their music done on computers \u2014 but not the Moranbong Band! While they do use electronic instruments, they know how to play them and the piano isn\u2019t electronic at all.Their lyrics are\u2026 interesting\u2026 to say the least.The ladies in here are the best of the best (in North Korea) \u2014 there\u2019s no competition between rival groups, etc. Also, they have the approval of Kim Jong-Un himself, who supposedly hand-picked them.A lot of their music videos are basically slideshows set to some music. For some reason, it makes me laugh.Their dances are really polished (see below)Take a look below:   ",

Hate to say this but i think EXO's fame has been decreasing lately and so many fans left our fandom. Note : I REALLY LOVE THEM T.T 2)INFINITE after Kris left EXO,i thought i would just stop liking them and stan another group. THEY'RE SO TALENTED. They're from Woolim ent,a small agency and they used to be one of the most popular kpop group in 2010/2011 ( i forgot). They are THE BEST if u are looking for kpop MR REMOVED. 3)VIXX A-NOT-SO-POPULAR group but their fandom is the best. AND THEY'RE TALENTED. Their concept are\u2026so unexpected.They never disappoint us with their comeback. CHECK OUT THE NEW MV 'SHANGRI LA' :) :) 4)IKON Nah,they say IKON is the 'most failed' group produced by YG ent. I used to hate them lol. The line distribution isn't fair\u2026 so many ppl call them '2B AND THE BOYS' 2B means BOBBY and B.I cause they always got the most part.And their maknae\u2026Chanwoo,ugh the only line he has on RHYTHM TA is 'NANANANANA' Its not a joke -_- 5)MONSTA X When they first debuted,they caught my attention (their debut song is so catching). But,i don't know why i couldn't stan them. This year,my friend show me their newest mv 'beautiful' and yeah\u2026 after that i watched their dance practice,memorized their name and start to watched their variety show.Monbebe (their fandom) is one of the best you could be friend with :) I stan another groups to like DBSK(OT5), SUPER JUNIOR,BIGBANG (thx for secret bigbang lol),B1A4,CNBLUE, and many more. But,my top 5 is on the list ^ ",

I\u2019ve shared my story on how I got into Kpop because of taemin\u2019s dancing. He singlehandedlt changed my perception of kpop. There was not too much uneeded flash and glammour in his dance; each move is instead supported by years of hard work and limitless talent. His move so delicate yet powerful, he was really untouchable back in the days. Slowly, I into all of SHINee and branched out to look at other groups. I always returned back to SHINee because none could captivate me like the 5 members did. Almighty Key, Bling Bling Jonghyun, Dubu leader Onew, Flaming charisma Minho and Maknae Taemin. The 5 of them literally defined my first half of Kpop life. Then EXO happened. SHINee lost momentum and fans get to see them less and less. Still, their comebacks focused nothing but quality. Through thick and thin, SHINee members have stuck together. In 2013 alone, they had 5 combacks: breaking news, dreamgirl, why so serious, boys meet you and everybody. Taemin had additional commitments with henry\u2019s solo. For each comeback , they had to record at least 5 songs and learn choreography for 2 songs. Not to mention back in their rookie days, they attended literally ALL musical events including all the small ones hosted in universities (check out their fancams, they had a lot). The point is that, they are super hardworking and talented. They should be appreciated more. I don\u2019t know why they aren\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh yeah! Finally a question that asks for my favourite groups! In plural form! Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f My recent favourite boy group is Seventeen. They have my favourite concept of all time: non women-degrading nor excessively possessive lyrics, fresh but intricate choreography, easy to listen melody, strong but not overly done raps. I also love that they don\u2019t take a sexy concept yet, even when they started trying a much darker concept than their usual. It\u2019s just everything they do is on the right dose, not too much but not too little. They also have active schedule throughout the year. And when they are resting and/or have no official on-air schedule, they would still give the fans some updates, sometimes going on a surprise live broadcasts or chat with fans on fancafe, VLive, or twitter. So I have no time to get bored and forget about them, and I think that\u2019s a great marketing system. For a girl group, my all time favourite is Lovelyz. I started being a fan right after their debut with Candy Jelly Love, and cry whenever they release new albums because they always show improvements each time. I also love VIXX, mainly for their versatilability. I love that they can take ANY concept and execute them perfectly. Sensual? Cute? Boyish? Dark? Real dark? Traditional? They\u2019ve done them all, and it feels like they own those concept. Infinite, well, I don\u2019t know why I love them in the first place, but I love the mad synchronization in their choreography, especially when Hoya was still in the group. And their songs are nice, too! Girl\u2019s Generation was my first favourite group, and my bias was Tiffany. If I were to mention other groups I also like and have their entire discography saved on my streaming account but not to the level that I play their songs everyday: Mamamoo, Cosmic Girls (WJSN), Gfriend, LOONA, Oh My Girl, and Girl\u2019s Day.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a devoted shawol (SHINee fan) and i first like SHINee mainly because their music is outstanding. They\u2019re one of, if not the most, experimental group in terms of music in kpop. They don\u2019t follow the trend, they make the trend. They\u2019re not afraid of making new sounds that might be unfamiliar for the public at the time, and usually being the one that introduces new sounds that\u2019ll be the trend all over kpop months after they started it. Their choreographies and dancing in general is also mindblowingly amazing. They make such high quality music with such marvelous artistry and aesthetic, also consistently powerful performances. They\u2019re just basically A+ in music artistry, vocals, dances, just everything included for a perfect performance.    Besides the music and performances, SHINee members are all very amazing human-beings, not being exaggerated at all. I could write 100 pages full essay as to why SHINee members are amazing, but i\u2019ll keep it short here. They\u2019re all very nice, intelligent, genuine, human-beings and the amount of love that they give for shawol (SHINee World; SHINee fandom) is unbelievable. They\u2019re very real people that also care about social situations and more often than not can be seen supporting constructive movements with their own voices which is so amazing. They\u2019re also very hardworking people that\u2019s always pushing for improvements and also genuinely love what they do, and love to perform with each other in front of their fans.  And also, what makes me love SHINee more and more is because of SHINee World itself. SHINee World as a fandom is to die for, honestly. Shawol have such beautiful fandom culture that\u2019s very genuine, kind, driven by love, and just overall goodness. I do believe that a fandom\u2019s personality definitely mirrors the group\u2019s personality and i feel like because SHINee is so genuine, loving, and respectful towards each other and towards their fandom, shawol can\u2019t help but mirror that and being even more genuine, loving, and also respectful towards them as well.  p.s: Buy MOVE by Taemin on iTunes and watch the MV on Youtube!

BTS is the type of band that will make you like every single member, no matter who your bias is, this band will be your bias. it\u2019s absolutely impossible not to be able to like everyone in this band, since everyone has their unique talents. The songs they produce under BigHit Entertainment is also hard to dislike. I have heard every single one of their songs and all of them are well written and sung. They have also received numerous awards, the MAMAs, Mnet Comebacks, SBCs, etc\u2026 Not only that, they have also been enlisted in the Billboards as \u2018Top Social Artist\u2019, beating Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and Shawn Mendes.

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of groups that are worth stanning, It always depends on your style of music too, but I stan five groups, NCT /WayV(Bias group), BTS (what got me into kpop), Stray Kids (They are legit legends and their survival show is insane), Seventeen (how can you not stan them, prolly one of the most well-rounded groups), and last but not least, Mamamoo (They r all so pretty and they all are rlly talented). But these are my preferences since I like EDM and singing based songs. Some other groups I would recommend: Ateez \u2192 Practical legends, I can't believe that they are rookies and all of their songs are absolute bops, Wave, Illusion and Say my name are prolly my favorite songs EXO \u2192 Also really good singers, they are a little older though, Monster, Love shot, Growl and Lotto are my fav songs by them Red Velvet \u2192 Another legendary group by SM, I haven't really liked their past two comebacks, but I have a ton of friends who really like them, Definitely listen to Power up, Ice cream cake, and Peek-a-boo ITZY \u2192 Another Rookie group, they r rlly talented, they have only had two cbs but both of them are bops, I would definitely listen to them (I swear JYP is the only group that knows how to deal with girl groups) Although these are all great groups, these are based on my music prefs, and don\u2019t be an immature kpopper and stan groups cuz of their looks, listen to their music and stuff first :) Happy Stanning :) ",

My other faves are Day6, Red Velvet, Mamamoo, ITZY, Blackpink and Twice. If a group has at least 5 songs in my top 100 current favorites-kpop edition, I consider them my fave groups. I am currently eyeing ANS (Bian is such an eye candy on stage and her voice is fantastic\u2026too bad they don\u2019t have as much content available online) and NIZIU (though they are japanese, their songs sounds kpop, and I find it easier to sing Japanese lyrics). I\u2019ve also been enjoying rewatching G.O.D. and SECHS KIES contents online. Once I\u2019m done with the 1st gen, I\u2019ll do reruns of Suju\u2019s and SNSD\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "R E D V E L V E T       Red Velvet because i love how adventurous they are with concepts and genres which is very fun and makes you always wondering and curious about what they\u2019re about to do next. I also think their vocal as a whole group is strong and complement each other very well. I think they are very pretty and have good maners. My fave is SEULGI because she\u2019s just the complete package; amazing dancing skill, outstanding and unique and chic aura, charisma you can\u2019t find anywhere else, great fashion sense, incredible vocals, photogenic, cool sense of fashion, lovable character (that\u2019s the simplest way for me to describe reasons why i love her because i can go on for DAYS if i have to go on details + the solo shot is the picture of her) But for other members, i like Irene because of her leadership that once i used to be not sure of but now i feel like her way of leading is not very visible but you can see from the little things that she does that she takes care of the member as both the leader and the eldest. For Wendy i like her because of her amazing kind-hearted personality and amazing vocal. She seems to be very humble and far away from the word greedy and always know how to make the members smile + although she\u2019s said to be the least out of the others in terms of dancing, i totally appreciate how she still dances with energy and tries. For Yeri, i LOVE love love her personality. I think she keeps it very real with the audience about herself, not forcing aegyo, not forcing her coolness/savageness, not being fake when caring about her members, just real! People judge her for all sorts of stuff but i can totally see how she (deep inside) cares and loves her older members very much. It shows a lot in her agressive yet clingy and playful behaviour. For Joy, i like her for being kind as well. You can say that she\u2019s the satan\u2019s child and all. Yes, she is very playful but that\u2019s not my focus. I actually think she\u2019s gentle towards her members despite being very playful. Plus, she has a great vocal. Maybe she\u2019s not the main or the lead but her vocal is amazing. ",

I also really like Ikon because they have the best vocals and just yAy :) I also stan exo a bit,, not really the people but i love their songs they have the best talent. I adore red velvet, the girls are really hard working and deserve a bit more love. They have very interesting songs and concepts. I really like BTS and TXT they are just the cutest little blobs and deserve so much love and I think their songs carry so much meaning. I also stan izone they actually have really nice music and i\u2019ve said this before but i also stan everglow quite a bit. I used to stan wannaone but unfortunately they did disband\u2026 monstax has some unreal rappers and blackpink has always been one of my favorite groups. Recently i feel like YG hasn\u2019t been managing well and Jennie lacks stage presence but they are still so talented. Also you have to love twice let\u2019s admit it, they might not have that girl crush concept but they are such an UWU. If you want to know some more about any groups or recommendations for me please tell me on my blog and i will post about it thanks, its called yAy kpop :) yAy kpop :) ",

            "answer_text": "I currently have 5 main groups I listen to right now. These are in no particular order: Big Bang  Practically everyone knows them. They\u2019ve been in the industry since 2006. Many consider them to be the kings of kpop, and rightfully so. I love how all of their voices are distinctly different. G-Dragon\u2019s voice has a slightly higher pitch, but it is still nice to listen to. TOP has a mesmerizing deep voice that suits both rapping and singing. Taeyang\u2019s voice is very smooth-sounding to me. He has a very good range and very good control. Seungri\u2019s voice is very sweet sounding, with a good upper range and lower range. Daesung\u2019s voice is deep and very powerful. As soon as I heard his voice, I needed to know who he is. Needless to say, this group is legendary. Recommended songs: Bang Bang Bang, Blue, Last Dance, Sober, If You Dreamcatcher  This group, contrary to Big Bang, is less known. Their primary genre is rock, which not many people in Korea listen to. Their newest album, The Tree of Language, they have songs exploring different genres. In my opinion, it\u2019s their best album so far. I really hope they get their first win this year, they deserve it. Their vocals are some of the best I\u2019ve heard. Siyeon\u2019s voice sends me to a different plane of existence. Dami\u2019s rapping is incredible, but she is also very good at singing (just listen to the bridge of Jazz Bar). Sua\u2019s dancing is too good for words. I love them so much. Recommended songs: You and I, Chase Me, Jazz Bar, Sahara, Scream Day6  Out of most Kpop bands (N Flying, Onewe, etc.), Day6 is more well known. A few of their music videos have a story line that some people think needs to be put into the form of a K-drama. They also have different genres in their discography. Like Big Bang, their voices are also very distinct. Young K has an amazing range, and he can go from a deep, gentle tone to a strong falsetto. Jae\u2019s voice is smooth, sweet sounding, and full of emotion. Sungjin\u2019s voice is very raspy, and he also has a very good range like Young K. His voice sounds good if he is singing softly or belting. Wonpil\u2019s voice has a higher tone, and is very stable. Like Jae, his voice is also full of emotion, especially in sadder songs. Finally, Dowoon\u2019s voice is deep and smooth. He doesn\u2019t sing much, as he\u2019s the drummer, but look out for songs where he has a small part. Recommended songs: Like a Flowing Wind, Sweet Chaos, Shoot Me, I\u2019ll Try, I Like You Exo  They went from being called SM\u2019s biggest mistake back in 2012/13, to being one of the most recognized Kpop groups today. They went through 3 members leaving the group in 2014/15. Their discography is one of the best in Kpop, with a wide range of genres. Many people say that they have the best vocal line in all of Kpop. All of them can sing, but the main vocalists (Chen, Baekhyun, and D.O.) shine the most. Even when he isn\u2019t being serious, Chen can hit extremely high notes (When he sang Tears on Knowing Bros). Baekhyun\u2019s voice is incredibly soothing. Listen to UN Village, it\u2019s an amazing song. D.O. can have either a powerful voice (Monster) or a softer voice (Sing For You). Overall, they are an amazing group with an amazing discography. Mamamoo  Amazing vocalists. Amazing performers. Absolutely hilarious. Mamamoo might be lesser known that Blackpink or Twice, but they still have a decently sized fanbase that is incredibly loyal. On stage, they have an air of charisma and confidence about them, and off stage, they are hilarious, genuine people. They don\u2019t feel the need to put up a facade, and they let people see their real personalities. If you ask practically anyone that knows them, you will hear that their vocals are unlike practically everyone in the industry. Even the main rapper, Moonbyul, has an incredible voice. On a side note, Hwasa\u2019s new solo is coming out on the 29th, so go listen to that when is comes out. Reccomeded songs: Decalcomanie, Universe, Starry Night, Wind Flower, 4x4ever  (Insert signature here) ",

            "answer_text": "I would definitely say BTS and Stray kids. -BTS bc how successful they've become throughout the years and how hard they worked for to become who they are today. Plus they technically saved their company as well bc they didn't start off as successful they started off from a poor company and tried to do their best when they were in 2013. They also have donated and influenced people to donate to people who need help and to the environment as well. They have helped so many people through physical and mental problems. it is sad to say that there probably going to disband soon bc of their contract and the fact that they've been in a group for 6 years. -Stray kids bc of how they're doing so many things at a young age and every single day they're becoming more successful as ever. Also how much they take care of their fans bc ive seen this video of them at the Spotify concert (bc there were going to perform) and basically what happened was that they were not going to perform until everyone steps back bc, people started to get hurt and they literally left for a few minutes until they were going to actually step back. And I just thought how much they do care for stays and of course theres many more moments as well. Its also sad on how they went on a survival show to see who was going to be in stray kids (i think, im not super sure about what it is) ",

            "answer_text": "I'll list the groups that I stan / \u201cstan\u201d down below! Blackpink: if you're able to wait for a comeback you should stan blackpink. I really like their music and they can pull of so many vibes. The girls work hard and and are very talented! I've seen them live and omg they are GOOOOD! Other than that they are very kind and sweet and a little more mature and calm. They care about people and adore animals which is very cute. They don't run around and scream all the time (they do somethimes lmao) but are still very entertaining. You can see they are a little bit older (mid 20\u2032s) and it's nice and refreshing. Jisoo is really funny and so are the other members. I think jisoo and rose are the kindest and sweetest girls alive. Jennie is super cute and very funny when she's scared. they all care about other people and love everyone. I would totally recommend you stanning them!Itzy: they are awesome. Their performances are ALWAYS on point. Their dancing is incredible and they are always in sync. They are talented vocalists and rappers as well. Monster rookies in my opinion. Their concept is very good an important, but they have more light songs as well. Their side tracks are bomb and so far I liked everything they put out. Their personalities are great as well, they are a jyp group. They are all very energetic and young. Basically the opposite of black pink. They have a great sense of humour and are amazing during variety shows. You can see they loveeachtother and care about the other members. Chearyoung once started crying because Lia said something really nice to her and then Lia started crying as well and it was such an emotional moment. You should check out their idol room and weekly idol appearances and you want to stan them. It's so funny.Gfriend: I don't really stan gfriend, because I don't really know how to get into the fandom, I'm working on it tho. I really enjoy their pure and angelic sound, it's a great way to be different from the other groups. They mix classical music with pop, which is awesome in my opinion. Their vocals are so good as well, the high note in time for the moon night makes me cry every time and their debut songs are still ICONIC. Their dancing is obviously what they are known for, so I don't think I need to say anything but, omg how are they so talented. They are a little bit calmer than your average group, but are still fun to watch at veracity shows so I suggest you give them try!Twice: I. Love. Twice. They were the second girlgroup I started to stan and i still love them. I watched SIXTEEN and I suggest you do as well. You'll understand everything when you watch that show. Its emotional, funny and deep. It explains why twice is the way it is and I loved it. The girls grew a lot since then and it's fun to see how they changed. Their dances got harder, their vocals got better and their raps became even more awesome. The girls are very funny as well, especially Sana, Momo and obviously dahyun, so watching variety shows is not a problem. They have a caring and loving side, while also being funny and energetic. I would suggest you stan them. You would constantly have new music to listen to when you stan twiceThat's it! ",

I love them so much that in between of a very critical project at work where it was almost near to production release and I was working like 14 hrs a day to resolve the issues, I flew down to LA from SF to see them. I worked till 11 PM before night..went to bed at 12 AM .. got up at 5 AM ..reached LA around 2 PM..booked a hotel and a car..went to concert at 7 PM..flew back next morning at 5AM and went to work at 9 AM. Considering my laziness and work schedule, I went to see them for just 1 Hour on stage and I did this All ALONE!    BIGBANG: this is my next favorite and first Kpop band I listened to. Their songs and style are awesome and if they ever come to US, I will make sure I will visit them :) I love TOP <3  ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite groups are : BTSI discovered this band completely by chance and at the time I didn\u2019t like kpop and I had some difficulties with myself. They arrived at the right time, their music, their lyrics, their videos, their hapiness and their fanbase allowed me to stand up to see the good side and fight. I would never be grateful enough for what BTS did for me.I think that BTS is the first group where I get involved at this point, where I keep informed about their comeback, their health etc... I am happy to be an Army Monsta X This band is a real surprise to me, I love the rapline. Even though the way the band was created and the No.Mercy period is a subject that I hate to talk about... I love this band, they\u2019re geniuses, they\u2019ve come to the same point as the BTS so far, and I hope I don\u2019t abandon either of those groups. I didn\u2019t think you could smile so much looking at these people-that I don\u2019t even know-have fun! KARD I really like this band already because it\u2019s a mixed group, I don\u2019t know why but I love this concept! And their music is really very training! I don\u2019t know what else to say... GOT7 and NCT I do them on the same line because although they are part of my favorite bands and I could spend my days listening to their music I really don\u2019t have much to say about them. For Got7 I love the energy of the group and for NCT the concept of subunits etc is very ingenious and really cool ",

            "answer_text": "I really do love ALL Kpop, and I could say that it is hard to pick my favorite groups\u2026 BUT it isn't. As of right now my absolute favorite Kpop groups are BTS, EXO, 4minute(disbanded 2016), Stray kids,IKON, NCT, BLACKPINK. I love them all for various reasons, but most of them are basically me saying that I just like them as a group. The members interact cutely, their music is outstanding, they make me laugh, they are all amazing at what they do! My top two would be BTS and EXO, because I've known them the longest, they are two great examples of what friendship is, and they are my role models. Hope this answers your question. when I was writing this paper, I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT\u2026. My role model in life- Bang Chan from Stray Kids, he is someone I look up to every single day and that is something I'm so proud of. He helps others before himself, he is kind\u2026 Let's not forget\u2026. -bAbYgIRlS- honestly he cares so much for Stays and its so so so inspirational to see this man totally change me, and many others. He needs more recognition and I need to give him my love, ALL OF IT\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not real mainstream in terms of my music taste, so you might not recognize these groups. There are a lot of groups I listen to here and there, these are just my top picks. N.flying  N.flying is a band under FNC. Some of my favorite songs by them are \u201cHot Potato\u201d, \u201cThe Real\u201d, \u201cLonely\u201d, and \u201cLike a Flower\u201d. Apart from having great music, this is probably the wildest group I\u2019ve encountered. They\u2019re funny and charming and, most notably, incredibly weird. Gotta love them, though. SF9  SF9 is also under FNC, although they\u2019re more of an idol group than a band. Some of my favorites by them: \u201cEasy Love\u201d, \u201cO Sole Mio\u201d, \u201cMamma Mia\u201d. These boys are also pretty wild, to be honest; just look at their Immigration video or their Cleopatra games. Aside from that, they\u2019re really good live and they have really great covers. Day6  Day6 is of course under JYP. They\u2019re a band, like N.flying, although their concepts are usually a lot softer. Favorites: \u201cI Need Somebody\u201d, \u201cColors\u201d, \u201cI Would\u201d, \u201cShoot Me\u201d. Oh, my babies. The members are so sweet and funny and are just really lovely, if occasionally weird. They have great covers in both English and Korean, too - 10/10 recommend. The Rose  The Rose is under J&Star and are a fairly new group - newest on this list, anyway, having debuted in August of 2017. They only have a couple of songs out so far, but my favorites at the moment are \u201cSorry\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s in the Rain\u201d, and \u201cBaby\u201d. These boys are really the softest, sweetest human beings on the planet. They\u2019ve got so much talent and I\u2019m super excited to see what they\u2019ll come out with next. That\u2019s my favorite K-pop groups in a nutshell. Other really good groups include Astro (especially their new releases, which I personally like a lot more than the older songs), Rad Museum, Monsta X, Seventeen, and others that have probably just slipped my mind.

BAP amaze me a lot with how strong they are, and I have endless amounts of respect for bang yongguk. They've been through a lot, and are honestly so kind and appreciative to their fans. Super talented, super attractive, super witty. Stan BAP, guys  I have a lot of respect for highlight for sticking together too and I like quite a lot of their songs and stuff. I'm fond of VIXX and infinite too, just because I think they're funny, and I like the general vibe of longer lasting idols. I liked sistar a lot too, they were super talented. Teen top and BtoB are some of my other favourite groups. Theyre both just carefree and hilarious to me. ",

            "answer_text": "my top 5 groups. I might seem like an oldie rn but is bc i grew up with 2nd gen., i still like newer groups but not as much. and lets just say itnw by snsd may or may not have gotten me through middle school\u2026MOVING ON: 5) Red Velvet I found it kinda hard to get into 3rd gen. when it started back in like 2012 because 2nd gen. was I C O N I C. But i rlly love Red Velvet. I remember when happiness come out, i hated it. But i became more fond of them once Ice cream cake came out, it was very catchy. And i absolutely LOVE Yeri. She is my bias. And i love their song peek-a-boo. I don\u2019t usually listen to newer girl groups but they are pretty good, and it takes a lot for a group to please me like this. 4) We have a tie between SNSD and 2NE1. I rlly cant choose. I was there with my girls 2NE1 since their debut in 2009, back then i just become kpop fan. I went to their NOLZA concert in japan back in the day, 2011. It was so much fun. I am the best is an absolute hit, and it was big not only in korea, but also a hit in america and japan, you cant tell me that that song wasnt pure gold. And as for SNSD, i wasnt too fond of them at first until i heard ITNW and Run devil Run. I became a huge SOne in 2010 and i even still have a shirt that says \u2018so stop, lets bring it back to 1:40\u2019 that i got in 2013. Although 2NE1 disbanded, i still will always love the OT4 and although Jessica was kicked out of SNSD and some members left SM AND they are not active, I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU OT9!! <3 3) Monsta X. You gotta admit they have best rappers in 3rd gen. and the vocals are PERFECTION. I demand you listen to Broken Heart, now! You will be amazed. Not only do i love their music, but i love their personalities. They arent fake unlike some groups. They also are funny. You need to Listen to Broken Heart and YCHMH, now. \u2018nuff said. they are also soo humble and kind. They BOWED TO THE FANS, ON THE FLOOR when they got their first win. watch this video,  2)Got7. THey are the reason i like 3rd gen. In 2014 i heard the song A from their second album and for a new group, it was bomb asf. Them and Monsta X are literally the only groups i can not pick bias in, they all are so great! And if you havent heard Never Ever or Lullaby, you should do that. The rap line\u2019s voices are very unique and easy to distinguish. They worked so hard to get the little recognition they get today (as well as monsta x) so pls support them and stream dye. last but not least\u2026 BIGBANG!!!! I have been v.i.p since 2008 since i heard the song \u2018haru haru\u2019 in korean this means day by day and in japanese it means springtime. Its a beautiful song amd to this day is one of my favorite kpop song. They are very controversial, even their debut was controversial (them being known as the ugliest boy band in korea)but i still love them. I went to their \u2018Stand up\u2019 tour in Japan around early 2009 and late 2008. it was actually my first concert as a preeteen. my aunt took me haha, and that was when i was live in japan before i come to america. they have very good solos and sub units song like crooked by gd ( i love this one so much) and eyes nose lips by taeyang and doom dada by top, daesung\u2019s japanese solo career (known as d-lite) daesung has so many good songs like i love you and look at me gwisun. They havve good duet like good boy by gd x taeyang and zutter by t.o.p x gd and baby good night by gd and top and knockout by gd and top and turn it up by top. there is just so many. i believe they are one of the best if not the best boys group in kpop (ik there are lots of other groups that are rlly good) anyways that it 4 today! stay safe ",

The way I understand K-pop is that it consists of boy or girl groups and there's another section that is more adult. The first has groups like BTS and Blackpink. I have some tracks on my iPod that qualify as K-pop like SNSD's Mr. Mr, Apink's Mr. Chu and EXO's Growl. My Korean music collection consists almost entirely of the 2nd section I mentioned earlier. If you can imagine a pie chart, this wedge would be 85\u201390%. Thanks to Apple Music, I have the full albums of Shinhwa, Davichi, Akdong Musician and Ailee. I've never checked but I probably have 200 tracks and music videos by those 4 artistes. To answer your question, my favorite Korean musician is Ailee. She has impressive vocal range and isn't difficult to look at, admittedly. ",

I love her work and how she\u2019s always pushing boundaries, though I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s the only one who does this or that she\u2019s the best at this, but I\u2019ve always liked her music since I first heard change in 2010. Her solo debut was deemed too inappropriate but as we all know she came out with an even more provocative video, \u201cBubble Pop\u201d in the next year, I love how she sticks with what she wants to do even if it\u2019s frowned upon. I love her sound and her stage presence is so overpowering that it\u2019s actually it\u2019s actually fun watching her perform. Also, her music varies from different genres from going to a ballad, rnb, and pop, this is must evident in her song \u201cRed\u201d which she did a marvellous job in the transition of music styles. I also love how well-rounded she is. She can rap, sing, and dance so well. She may not be the best singer but her voice in her song \u201cSerene\u201d was so mesmerising, I definitely suggest giving that song a listen. I know she gets a lot of criticism because of her sexy image, but she stated herself that it empowers her and I think that\u2019s a great message that you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of what makes you feel powerful. Anyways, those are the reasons on why I\u2019m an A-ing(official fandom name). ",

Even Dispatch exposed them and Koreaboo made acticles about the rumors and how they are true.If you see them both, you might even start to ship them! It just somehow happens! And they are not the two idols you may think they are, it is not Jungkook and Taehyung or Jennie and Lisa.   In fact, they are married and they have children! . . . . . . . . . They are: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Jimin and Shrek.  I am really glad they ended up together. The world would never be the same if they were not together. . . . . . . . Just kidding! I do not ship any K-Pop idols. I personally think that shipping two idols together is weird. Especially BlackTan. If you ship any, that is alright. As long as you do not get so invested into making them a couple. :) Goodbye! ~Mei M. Aki ",

Its just that BTS's songs resonated a lot with me...2) They have a strong vocal and rap line which makes it a perfect blende... Wonderful to listen too...3) The choreography!!!!!!! Goodness!!!! As I once read in a meme, 'Their choreography was probably created by Satan himself ;);)' Its a pleasure to watch them perform!!!! The energy, with which they perform.... They literally FIRE up the stage with their DOPE performances(forgive the pun, I simply couldn't resist\\U0001f609)...4)AND they happen to be fabulous models and amazing people too!!!!! They are united and together, always supporting each other(like when everyone attended Jimin's performance and Jungkook's graduation).. That's what makes them superb!!! So... All that stuff just makes them A.M.A.Z.I.N.G, and makes me proud to be an ARMY!!! ",

I found out about them when I was at quite a low time in life, I was seriously thinking of giving up and ending it all, I has therapy sessions but they were not helping, I still had suicidal thoughts and started distancing myself from everyone around me. But one day on the news I saw that BTS were the first kpop group to be invited to the AMAs or something like that and was like, that's interesting. So searched them up as you do when curious and their songs generally made me happier than I had ever been. And to this day it still does, over the years their music and message has encouraged me alot and I feel like a changed person. That's why they will always be my ult no matter what, they rlly changed my life even if they dont know it. NCT Apart from BTS their songs are the ones I play the most. Also these dudes always make me laugh I love their energy. I also love the uniqueness of all the units songs, they rlly are different from groups nowadays ",

And so, that's a reason why their my favorite kpop group. And because, I deeply admire them so much -- the way they dance, sing, rap, their personalities and mind, and how they overcame their hard journey and being on the top charts, and also their bright/good vibes I get from them, and how they are learning English and how they have improved in it,, throughout the years. And their other skills they have improved in -- And so, yeah.. That's why BTS will always be my favorite k-pop group and why I'll always be a ARMY for the rest of my life. (But, I also like other k-pop groups, but BTS is and will be my 1st favorite group forever.) ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, this is coming from a totally casual fan that's been listening to Kpop for years now. And by casual I mean I am following their music less their life. Big Bang without doubt is my number one pick. They have great songs, I find them to be less generic, overly audio-tuned than most Kpop. As individuals they seem pretty down to earth and just a fun bunch to be around.TVXQ ( 5 or as 2 separate groups) is probably one of the first groups I had contact with ( the other being Shinee). I fell in love quickly with their ballads, their beautiful voices and how well they blend together. I gotta admit they are also pretty handsome fellas but that was not quite a decisive criteria when I places them 2nd.Shinee. Although music wise I have my faveorite and less favorite song and I am not familiar with all of their discography, they just have a special place in my heart. I've had some of their song on my phone for years and I keep listening to them on repeat quite often. They are all really talented and good looking, and I hope that losing one of their precious members last year will only make them stronger.Highlight( former known as Beast). I have been familiar with their existence since quite some time, but just a while ago I got into their music. Pretty good vocals and catchy songs and that was enough for me.Cross Gene. I found them pretty randomly and I don't really know much about them but I like quite a lot of their songs so there's that.",

            "answer_text": "Right now I fully stan the first 3 groups, but there are a couple which I\u2019m a big fan of and will start stanning: Red Velvet- because they are pure talent and duality. They have the best vocals and can cover girl crush and cute concepts both perfectly NCT (All units but mostly NCT 127)- because unlike other groups, they show a lot of personality and their human side. They\u2019re undoubtedly the only group in kpop serving fans both quality songs and a whole crap load of content (vlogs, games, short movies lol, basically anything). They\u2019re the only group to have released short music videos for each and every song in an album. Not to mention their all aces, so they can all sing, rap, and dance, so they\u2019re not confined to one specialty. Not to mention a whole buffet of 21 visuals and godly rappers like Mark \u201cBruce\u201d Lee, Taeyong, and Lucas. Every member is unique and brings something different, so the fact that they mix them up in NCT U for a song is pretty creative. Exo- Again, vocals are off the charts, and I\u2019m talking Chen, D.O., Baekyun and Lay. Then astounding visuals like Kai and Lay, Also, the rappers, Chanyeol and Sehun, are very talented. Plus their duality is just so precious: Sexy, dark, and mysterious on stage, intimidating non fans, but then cute, funny, crackheads when in interviews or filming fun videos. They really treasure and cherish their fandom like no other! Got7- I don\u2019t know what it is about them, but I just love how they have a lot of baritones or deeper voiced members and singing voices. Plus the vibes in their songs are so inspirational and deep. CIX and Cignature- Duuuuuuuuudeee!!!!! Go listen to them!!!! Groups like TXT and ITZY have nothing on them, trust me! They are both new groups under C9 entertainment, and CIX just hits different, making me forget that I like both guys and girls lol. Listen to their songs Movie Star and Rewind. CIGNATURE seem to be genuinely having fun in their mvs, and they are right in between the Girl crush and cute, so when they act subtly seductive, it feels like they\u2019re not doing it for a guy but for themselves. Listen to Assa! ",

I don\u00b4t remember if I first saw Mirotic or Keep your head down, but I was stunned by both songs and by both choreographies and whole videos. Then I looked on their other work and they got me. And I have to say, I love them more as duo, than as 5 members band. Changmin high tones are unique and perfect and U-Know is so talented. Both are very talented. They have always great choreography and their music is just my cup of tea. I love their new songs Chance of love and Love line and Truth. And beside their voices, they are handsome and charming too. I listen to Exo, Super Junior, B.A.P,C-Clown (big, big mistake, that they were disbanded), Boyfriend, GOT7, History, Infinite, Henry, MBLAQ, Monsta X, Seventeen, Shinwa, Shinee, VIXX, Winner, Cross Gene, Beast, BTOB and others, but TVXQ is the best of the best.

They are very talented artist who write their own songs, compose their own music, choreograph their own dances. Their voices and visuals are out of the world. Their fans are called ahgase which means baby birds. They love their fans to the moon and back and always try to include their fans in their songs while using reference of birds in their music videos. They are very funny but their thinking is very mature.  2. BLACKPINK Blackpink consists of 4 members Jisoo who is vocalist, Jennie who is rapper, Lisa who is rapper and Rosie who is vocalist. They trained for more than 6 years to debut. Their songs always have a important message mostly of women empowerment and how women should always stand for themselves first and how we shouldn't be bound by boundaries with men live your life your way and many more. Their fans are called BLINKS. Their group was named blackpink which means every human has a pretty side to themselves and they need to embrace it.  3.

For instance Insomnia which as the name they talk about the problem of some kids and adult not being able to sleep and 42 (which was made by 3racha and sung by them too) talks about suicide and depression. There\u2019s another song called My Pace( which was the song that got me into them) which talks about going at ur own pace and trying to not compare urself to others. Personality wise I would say they\u2019re crackheads and their super funny. They also interact a lot with Stays( the fandoms name) mostly Bangchan or Chan (he\u2019s the leader of the group) he does weekly lives if I\u2019m correct and he interacts with korean Stays and intl Stays. Here\u2019s a pic of all of them  They also have 9 vocalists,9 rappers and 9 dancers. Oh and I forgot to put that 3racha are the people who produce and write their songs. Members in 3racha are: Chan, Changbin and Han. They\u2019re also a trio formed before Stray Kids was formed and they have a lot of pre debut songs that you should check out. ",

            "answer_text": "You probably might get this answer a lot, but BTS is my favorite Kpop group. You might also get the same answer for why people like their music, but here\u2019s just my perspective. There are legit A LOT of reasons why people like BTS. People like BTS for Their visualsTheir hard and intense choreographyTheir overall stage-presenceTheir song-writing skillsTheir messagesTheir infamous story linePersonally, I like BTS more for their messages. A lot of BTS songs have a very emotional meaning behind it. RM (leader) is a bookworm, and he reads a lot of literature, which is where he gets his ideas from. That\u2019s why a lot of their music is beautiful. I\u2019m not saying this in a \u2018dramatic\u2019 way; I really mean it. Their song \u2018Blood Sweat and Tears\u2019 was inspired by the Icarus story and a book called Demian. Below is the basic summary of the book:Herman Hesse's novel Demian tells of a young boy named Emil Sinclair and his childhood growing up during pre-World War I. Emil struggles to find his new self-knowledge in the immoral world and is caught between good and evil, which is represented as the light and dark realms. 2. Spring Day, a song about the loss of a friend, a song about leaving a place where there is fake happiness, a song about carrying on. It is a song inspired by a book called \u2018The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas\u2019. Below is the summary of the book: Omelas is a utopian city where the people lead lives that are happy, in the best sense of the word. HOWEVER, the happiness and success the people in this \u2018town\u2019 is based on a child\u2019s suffering. This child is locked away somewhere below the city, with no clothes and no sense of comfort. The more this child suffers like this, the longer the people\u2019s prosperity lasts. Spring Day is also based on the movie \u2018Snowpiercer\u2019. Snowpiercer is a story set in 2031, where due to some failed test, all life on earth is gone, except for those aboard the train \u2018Snowpiercer\u2019. The Snowpiercer continues to travel around the world without an end. I can\u2019t explain verything here, but I suggest you check the plot out to understand. But how is it connected to Spring Day? At the end of the Snowpiercer movie, something hit the train, making it fall on it\u2019s side and stop. The people inside can finally come out. They are breaking free from that \u2018dungeon\u2019. One last thing about Spring Day, is that they show how important friendship is. In one scene, they show JK lighting a match alone in a room, but it blows out. He then lights ANOTHER match, and he is no longer alone in the room-his friends are sitting with him. The match doesn\u2019t blow out. 3. Another song that is possibly inspired by literature, was the song \u2018The Truth Untold\u2019. That song is amazing. The Truth Untold is (possibly) based on La Citta di Smeraldo. It's the story of a man who lived in a castle and kept to himself because he thought himself to be ugly. One day a woman came near his castle and picked his flowers. He was angry at first but eventually became curious and waited for her. He found out that she was actually selling those flowers for a living. The man fell in love but didn't want to show himself because he was \"too ugly\" (you know that I can't show you me, give you me..) So he decided to plant a flower that didn't exist on the planet so she could sell it at an expensive price. Eventually he manage to fill his garden with them but the women stopped coming. He then learned that she had died. That part where they sing 'but I still want you' is about him regretting not telling her his feelings all because he didn't love himself first. Isn\u2019t that just a beautiful way to bring literature into music? That\u2019s why I like BTS. Personally, I like literature too, so that\u2019s another reason why I connect to BTS. And as a person who struggles with self-love, their songs really speak to you. It\u2019s not only melodically warm, it\u2019s lyrically beautiful. Someone once said, \u2018When you\u2019re happy, you listen to the elody; when you\u2019re sad, you connect with the lyrics\u2019. In conclusion, BTS don\u2019t write songs, they write beautiful stories ",

            "answer_text": "I'd really like to address @User-10757409031954706390 There's a difference between a trend group and a group with influence. BTS is trending right now, they're not necessarily the most popular group. You could ask someone if they knew BTS and they'd say \u201cYes I've heard of them\u201d, but if you ask for a song name a lot of people wouldn't be able to give one, whereas most people in Korea know \u2018Growl\u2019 and \u2018Call Me baby\u2019. BTS can trend all they want but that doesn't mean they have influence over listeners like EXO & BIGBANG. Ps. BTS got a million sales off of 2 combined albums (Wings & Wings : YNWA) whereas EXO got 1 millions sales in 24 Days for \u2018The War\u2019 album & BIGBANG can get 2 million slaes off only 1 album. BTS isn't as popular as a lot of people seem to think. & EXO has beat BTS for multiple popularity awards (Just recently won a popularity awards @ the Soribada Music Awards) & not to mention EXO has 19 Daesangs & BB has 10 while BTS has 3 lol ",

For which, I am very grateful to her. At first, my sister made me listen to SHINee's Ring Ding Dong and EXO's Ko Ko Bop. In the up next section of Ring Ding Dong ,there was always Lucifer which I used to get .But I didn't like Lucifer from its intro. And when I was listening to Ko Ko Bop, I got Call Me Baby in the up next section. I listened to it and I loved it.I also listened to Monster. In YouTube mix, I got to listen to Growl.You guys may know or may not, but Growl is the legendary song which made Exo-Ls.When I was getting obsessed with Growl, I started to stan EXO. Chanyeol is my ultimate bias.I am an Exo-L. Especially, vocals of Exo are excellent.Their talents ,dances ,songs ,raps-I love these things about EXO. That's why I stan EXO and you should too only if you are interested.I am not gonna force you. ",

But after them I can list top 3 I guess. 1.iKon: I loved them before but after those 2 programs which WiN and Mix&Match I love them deeper. I can see how they want to achieve good things and I\u2019ll always support them for it. Because they survived after two programs, most people couldn\u2019t do that, even I couldn\u2019t handle those progress. And Kim Hanbin, you have the biggest part of this top 1 thing, literally. 2.Winner: Since they have been in the same program (WiN), even though I supported iKon continuously they made me love them in this show. Before seeing that program, I thought they were not genuine but they proved me wrong. 3.BigBang: I gotta put them here because they made me started this journey and they literally deserve this in my heart. Because of the things lately happened I feel really down since that person was my first bias but when I met them, they were there with music and good vibes. So I\u2019ll keep them as one of my top 3 because I can\u2019t throw away those 4 men like it is nothing. ",

My first Stray Kids song being Hellevator, I never really heard anything like it before. But off stage they were such precious little kids it was impossible to hate them (and here begins my journey, after I tripped into the hole called \u2018YOU\u2019RE STAYING FOREVER\u2019) They improved so much since their survival show. Felix was nearly eliminated because of his korean, and Lee Know made many mistakes, and the ones who really stood out were 3RACHA. Now, none of them really lack any skills. The biggest reason why I became a fan is when I found out they write and produce their own music, including their predebut mixtape. It might seem normal, but to me it\u2019s impressive that such young boys openly and honestly write about such good subjects (debut struggles, society problems, etc) while this type of music is slowly shrinking away. I heard they also work on their own choreographies. Have I mentioned that Changbin (SpearB), Bang Chan (CB97) and Han (J.One) wrote many amazing songs under the name 3RACHA on their own? Some are just hilarious (Wow, Hoodie Season) and some just made my jaw drop (Placebo, Broken Compass). Stray Kids\u2019 are trying out new concepts (Awkward Silence and My Pace) and the members are finding out their best points and weaknesses, their albums keep getting better and better. I hope you all STAY~ ",

They ruled over kpop for multiple years that even now they are deemed as legends. But in the present era they are more focused on the individual careers but they are considered two of the biggest groups. In the third generation, it is undoubtedly BTS and Exo with a difference of few years. From 2012\u20132015 Exo was the biggest boy group but by 2015 BTS started gaining momentum both in terms of exposure, critical acclaim as well as revenue. So right now both are the biggest in Kpop. After them Seventeen and Twice are looking like the next big groups because of their wide audience and interest from GP. ",

Anyway here\u2019s some groups that I stan and you should stan them to (don\u2019t let anyone tell you you shouldn\u2019t stan a group bc another group is better, branch out find out what you like best) : Boy groups EXO EXO CBX SHINEE SUPER JUNIOR IKON BIG BANG WINNER GOT7 DAY6 2PM STRAY KIDS SEVENTEEN BTS TXT WANNA ONE BTOB ATEEZ ASTRO SF9 THE BOYZ INFINITE HIGHLIGHT MONSTA X NCT & SUBUNITS THE ROSE VIXX Girl groups GIRLS GENERATION aka SNSD RED VELVET FX TWICE WONDER GIRLS ITZY MISS A BLACKPINK 2NE1 MAMAMOO APINK WJSN DREAMCATCHER LOONA EXID GFRIEND GIDLE IOI IZONE OH MY GIRL PRISTIN soloists IU JAY PARK SUNMI AILEE BOA TAEYEON DEAN :))) \u2190 stan him lmao CRUSH ZICO CHUNGHA ERIC NAM G DRAGON HEIZE HYUNA LOCO TAEMIN hahaaha I kinda went I over board (and this isn\u2019t even everyone lmao). But but the point I\u2019m trying to make, is that there\u2019s not one person or group listed above that is perfect. I feel that kpop these days is all about comparing whose better and that\u2019s how fanwars start. I\u2019m not saying stan everyone haha that\u2019s wayyy too much time. What I\u2019m saying is that there is so much talent to chose from, why generalize who is the best? I hope this helps you make a decision. In my opinion, there is no group that is \u201cTHE BEST\u201d becasue there is a variety of talent all throughout the industry ",

            "answer_text": "This is extremely hard to say because all the groups are truly precious to me. They all had a huge impact into changing my life. But well my favorite Kpop group would be Stray Kids. They are really talented. The rappers can sing and the vocalists can rap! Also they are really young and they followed what they wanted to be. Even though for a couple were hard they managed to hold on and prove their worth. Another reason why I love Stray Kids is the reason is that most of their songs if you listen and look at their lyrics it is mostly about their experiences of how they became a trainee and and idol. All the members show the hardships, all the difficulties of becoming an idol. Not that I have anything against the other Kpop groups is just that they only show the good side or the happiness of being an idol. EVen if it is sad it is usually is associated with love, heartbreaks, and breakups. Stray Kids shows the scarred side of the moon of Kpop. This is the reasons why I love them and how they will forever remain my #1 favorite even long after they disband even when I hope the don\u2019t.     ",

But, just going from an overall perspective, I would say Twice are in 3rd place as they are more popular across Asia but are still well known in the western parts of the world. They have the most albums sold for a kpop girl group, and have the most followers out of the other contenders for third place. So it would be: BTSBlackPinkTwice",

With cute, boy next door charms and colourful videos, each song has deep meanings and has been self written by its own members.      BLACKPINK Blackpink is probably the best and the most popular Girl group ever after Wonder Girls, 2NE1 and Girl\u2019s generation. Based on the concept of girl power, it is very unlikely of any other Korean girl Group. With the big label of YG, this 4 membered group has the best dancer, singer, rapper and visual. Known for its fashion and expensive music videos, it is the first ever kpop group to perform at Coachella.      EXO The sexiest boy group in Korea, it is the most popular boy group in Korea and japan and the second most popular internationally. It mainly uses sexy masculine themes unlike BTS and has elements of Hip Hop, eDM etc in it. it has nine members under the big label of SM town      TWICE Under the big label of JYP, this nine membered girl is one of the most popular GG in both Korea and international. Each song has the elements of aegyo and happiness in it. Twice is synonymous to color pop because of the MVs that are cutesy and very feminine and has lot of soft fun dance moves.      ",

A recently debuted 4-member band called The Rose is, well, the apple of my eye? I fell in love with their debut song Sorry and the two main vocals' voices were absolutely a wonder, especially Woosung's. I first saw them because of the MV, and here I have to mention the cinematography and their acting was as good as their song. (Jaehyung's solo frames had me gaping at his similarities to Luhan\u2014except for the jawline) They already had gigs and events and they covered many English/American and Korean songs months (or ~2 years?) before this, and now I'm catching up with their busker events through fancams in Youtube. Fortunately there's an Instagram account for their international fanbase (unofficial, but the band gained international fans more due to this fan account).  ",

The rise of NCT and SKZ was noticed by my friends before I realized how much of my attention they truly held. I absolutely adore the variety of sounds they present with their songs, and the members are just fantastic! SEVENTEEN has always been one of my favorite groups but with the release of You Make My Day last year they solidified their spot in my top 3. For the ladies, Red Velvet was the first girl group I really fell in love with. Their duality was a big selling point, they can truly pull off any concept. I don't care what anyone says, BLACKPINK has BOPS! I love their music and through BLACKPINK Diaries I came to love them too~ CLC first snatched me during Hobgoblin era, and with \u201cWhere Are You?\u201d they held on. I think they are so talented, and I was incredibly proud when they got their first win this year! There are actually a few groups who could be considered above these 6, but they aren't listed because I view them as unrankable. BIGBANG, SHINEE, EXO, SUJU, AND 2NE1 are those groups. All amazing, all legendary! They hold an extremely special place in my heart~ ",

Now that I have listened to some other boy band groups like EXO, 2PM, Super Junior, BTS, Shinee, BTOB, JYJ, S501 etc, I consider Big Bang are true kings of K-pop. Big Bang is now a veteran boy band group that has been in the music industry for over a decade. Debuted in 2006.  Just in case you don\u2019t know; as per the above photo Big Bang memebers (from left to right) Taeyang, Seungri, G-Dragon (leader), T.O.P and Daesung. I honestly like all their songs. Even though they have released only few albums during the ten years as a group, each of the members have a promising solo career as well. Currently the group activities are on hiatus as the members are enlisting in the army. However, their solo performances are second to none. I totally recommend Big Bang! ",

            "answer_text": "My all time favorite is Big Bang. They had their ten year anniversary this year, and they are on hiatus at the moment (military inscription starting up + other problems) but their songs are just great to listen to. They\u2019ve done a ton of different styles, and because of how old they are of a group, they\u2019ve kind of done a lot of the music eras present in these past 10 years. There\u2019ll honestly be at least one song every kpop fan could like. Their more popular songs (if your interested) are: \u201cfantastic baby\u201d, \u201cblue\u201d, \u201clast dance\u201d, \u201charu haru\u201d. Other than these, I personally love their songs \u201clove song\u201d \u201cTell me goodbye\u201d \u201cOh my friend\u201d and \u201cbeautiful hangover\u201d (TOP\u2019s part in beautiful hangover is awesome) They\u2019re a bit old but definitely worth looking into, especially their old songs. I also recommend 2ne1 (disbanded), 2pm, TVXQ, FTIsland and Jay Park (he\u2019s not a group but he can sing and rap really well. Careful with some songs though- their mv\u2019s might be 18+) ",

I remember there are some group that I like at first but in the end I only love them. And for the question \u2018Why?\u2019 I actually can give you 5 sheets of A4 paper and that's still not enough to write all of the reasons. But here I go with the main reasons: I love their bond (or chemistry). Their friendship is really too big for this world. 9 different personalities trying to fit to each other. Even though it's 8 officially :\u2019 I sometimes love to watch dorky member play along well with quite member. I love how 180\u00b0 different personality can go together well.Their hardwork are amazing. I often feel me myself isn't really a hardworking person so I really respect those who admirably hardworking. And for me the level of SNSD\u2019s hardwork and devotion are amazing. Being an Idol itself, for me, can be categorized as hardworking and perfectionist. And I think they're higher than average. When I watched Produce 48 and Produce x 101 it seems like being trainees for 5 years is incredibly long. But I remember many SNSD members have trained for 5 - 7 years. I know right? The bloody 7 years! It's Jessica and Yoona. If I were them maybe I have cried and tell my mom that I can't do it longer. I would simply (and easily) say that being an Idol is not my destiny lol.Their music is amazing. Their music are incredibly diverse. From Taeyeon herself, I can listen to many genres only from her solo albums. I always listen to their songs since years ago and won't be bored. If I'm in bad mood they provide great ballads. Or if I simply want to listen some songs while reading a book I can hear many type of songs ranging from cute, emotional to super badass. When I'm busy and can't follow them up, their songs always nurture my love for them and remind me of how amazing they are. There is a quote, I forget whether it's from fans or from them. Basically it said, \u201c If you don't love SNSD, Then raise your standard!\u201d ;)",

They have 10 members, and 9/10 had participated in atleast 2 songs. They also release their own self-composed songs for fun on Youtube/Soundcloud!Multitalented (actually 90% the same as no.1). The main vocal and main rapper are also lead dancers, rappers can sing, their main dancer (Kino) has a few songs on his Soundcloud (www.soundcloud.com/knnovation), and as stated in number 1, a few members have their own self-composed solo songs.Funny and entertaining. Watch a few of their videos!Their visuals are top-notch. I\u2019m not even kidding on this one, their visuals are so good! All 10 of them are really handsome and cool and cute and ughhhhh how to explain.This one might be the most bullshit out of all the reasons, but the pentagon stairs. Yes, ranging from Wooseok (188 cm) - Yuto (186 cm) - Hongseok (181 cm) - Hui (175 cm) - Jinho (169 cm).And yes, I love those 10 dorks so much. ",

Edit: Ok coming back to this, I\u2019ve kinda unstanned Itzy since I don\u2019t like some of their music. Skz is my ult, with BTS right behind. I\u2019m currently working on stanning Twice and Day6 soon after, possibly Dreamcatcher. I\u2019m not gonna delete any of my answer though\u2026 I included reasons for the first four (with 2 pics for each) but I don\u2019t really have reasons for the rest except that I like the music. I might edit later. Hopefully this won\u2019t be too long. 1st- The main groups I stan (the only ones I know all the member\u2019s names) are: Bts- Mmmannnyy reasons\u2014 They are VERY talented. They make good music. They are GODLY dancers I swear their stuff ain\u2019t easy for ANYONE. They spread uncommon and amazing messages and talk about things that are \u201ctaboo\u201d. They work their a$ses off every day, and have for over 7 years with one a one month break. They have amazing visuals (they are all hot/cute/handsome/eVeRyTHiNg). Their music has a lot of range (in style/genre).  Stray Kids- They are also very talented and work very hard. I can relate to a lot of their music. (And it\u2019s not about love and heartbreak and crushes and being depressed.) They have pretty cool dances and can dance very well. They have a lot of pretty much rock that I enjoy. (Even my 50 y/o dad likes some of it.) They have awesome visuals. Sidenote we miss Woojin.  MCND- I like their music for when I am wanting to listen to pop. They are very new still so they don\u2019t have much music and I don\u2019t know much about them though. They have awesome visuals. They are DANCE KINGS, even doing covers of BTS, Exo, Nct\u2026 and NAILING it.  Itzy- Pretty much the only girl group I stan. They don\u2019t always have a a super cute/girly/feminine music style and concept (that I often find annoying). They are very talented, especially in vocals. They have more complex dances than a lot of girl groups I see. They are also all very beautiful (TEACH ME HOW PLZ). They are a fairly newer group so I don\u2019t know too much but they\u2019re cool.  Blackpink- I have kindof unstanned them since they don\u2019t have much (any) content. After three years, about 15 songs and no full album\u2026 it\u2019s YG\u2019s fault but yeah. \u2014\u2014 Edit: Ok they\u2019re HAVING A COMEBACK FINALLY Wkljdajwdaawdjwdakjwdl I might end up being a stan (again) if if if the songs are different and I like the concepts.2nd- I (sometimes) know a couple member\u2019s names, and at least a few songs. NCTExoTwice3rd- I know about one or two songs, have heard about them and watched a couple music videos. EverglowLoonaTwiceAteezGot7MaxOneusSuperMBlock BBTOB(G)I-dleKardDay6DemianTxTDreamcatcherHope this helps! -Audrey  Edit: Added a few more groups/ I\u2019ve edited this like 3 times I\u2019m so indecisive djskdbskdb ",

            "answer_text": "For me, TVXQ. Say what you want but New Generation K-Pop will never be as good as the old generation, sorry to all the new gen fans, but no. Auto tune & western influence in K-Pop got super popular somehow. I think this happened when SM debuted F(X) & YG debuted 2NE1. Live stages started getting less genuine, if a group is singing live you can hardly hear them because the background music is so loud. Miss the days where idols were actually singing during performances, and not lip-syncing. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of talented idols, but most groups rely heavily on visuals and give lines to their artists according to popularity, there's maybe 1 or 2 average vocalists per group, the rest are usually visuals. TVXQ - Mirotic, \ub3d9\ubc29\uc2e0\uae30 - \uc8fc\ubb38, Music Core 20081025 DBSK - Love in the Ice [Inkigayo] (08.09.28) {Hangul, Romanization, Eng Sub} Tea. Where's the prerecorded audio? Hm. Anyways I do prefer most veteran groups over new gens, I know people will hate me for this but hey, it's the truth. ",

            "answer_text": "SEVENTEEN ->WHY? 1.CUZ THEY\u2019VE BEEN SELF-PRODUCING THEIR MUSIC ND CHOREOGRAPHY SINCE THEIR DEBUT ND THEIR ROOKIE ALBUM Became \u201cthe longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and was the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's \"10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015\" chart. Since then they\u2019ve become a great hit. 2.Their love for their fandom(carats) is amazing.They provide so many entertaining contents like GOING SEVENTEEN(2018,2019,2020->WHICH IS STILL ONGOING ND VERY FUN),INSIDE SEVENTEEN VIDEOS,IF\u2019S AND SO MANY.They prepare fanchants for carats nd present them. 3.Their success is amazing.They come from a small company \u201cPLEDIS\u201d.Every one knows that \u201cPLEDIS\u201d exists bcoz of SEVENTEEN.They never get good promotion nd management.Everyone thought that they would disband soon after their debut.But they proved everyone wrong. Even coming from a shitty company who treats them poorly nd does\u2019nt give proper promotions SEVENTEEN worked really hard since they were teenagers and their PASSION nd HARDWORK nd their loyal fandom CARATS is what made them one of the successful nd one of the best kpop groups ever.Their album \u201cAN ODE\u201d was named the NUMBER 1 ALBUM AMONG THE BEST KPOP ALBUMS OF 2019 BY BILLBOARD. 4.THE MEMBERS-> There are thirteen members. VOCAL TEAM(5 members),PERFORMANCE TEAM(4 members),HIP HOP TEAM(4 mem). Each one of them has amazing personality.Don\u2019t be overwhelmed by the numbers.Otherwise u will miss a lot on them.(The r very easy to remember, just watch weekly idol,knowing bros).They are the most entertaining,most caring,most talented members i\u2019ve ever seen. With all the contents they provide nd the music written by their member \u201cWOOZI\u201d, U feel like u r actually connecting with them. and u do connect with them.I found my peace when i found SEVENTEEN.They have freakin amazing personalities. THEY R VERY DOWN TO EARTH ND VERY FRIENDLY WITH MANY KPOP GROUPS. 5.Their album \u201cheng:garae\u201d SOLD 1,000,000 COPIES IN UNDER A WEEK and became a huge success for them.SEVENTEEN,BTS,EXO were the nly ones who have a record of selling 1,000,000 million copies in under a week. 6.Listen to nd watch their songs \u201cDON\u2019T WANNA CRY\u201d, \u201cTHANKS\u201d, \u201cHUG\u201d, \u201dSMILE FLOWER\u201d, \u201c247\u201d, \u201cOUR DAWN IS HOTTER THAN DAY\u201d, \u201cHOME\u201d, \u201cLET ME HEAR U SAY\u201d (omg they have so many nd literally does\u2019nt have a bad song at all) 7.For bops watch nd listen to \u201cCLAP\u201d, \u201cFEAR\u201d, \u201cAJU NICE\u201d ,\u201dHIT\u201d, \u201cGETTING CLOSER\u201d, \u201cLEFT_N_RIGHT\u201d. 8. Be sure to watch their MV\u2019S and performances bcoz SEVENTEEN is considered the BEST PERFORMING GROUP along with nct. Their choreographies r the most CREATIVE nd COMPLEX nd FREAKIN GREAT. SEVENTEEN\u2019S member HOSHI creates most of their choreographies nd won many awards for their choreography. No one can talk about dance without SEVENTEEN. 9.Lastly in my opinion they r literally the best thing happened to me.Even though they r very popular in MANY ASIAN COUNTRIES ,MEXICO(ACTUALLY SO MANY COUNTRIES) nd even AMERICA , If they got good promotions,good management by their company in the past they would have been even more popular in western countries. Sometimes i feel like they r under appreciated. Even though they come from a shitty company, SEVENTEEN came all this way nd made their name bcoz of their own hard work nd support from carats.I was really amazed by the fact they self produced their music since their debut And I\u2019m proud to be a CARAT. Hope they get good promotion in the future since they r under BIGHIT nd more people will recognise them cuz they r hella TALENTED nd AMAZING GROUP. U WILL NEVER REGRET THE DECISION OF STANING THEM.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Rebecca Rodriquez. I\u2019m assuming you mean favorite? For official Kpop groups, I\u2019d have to go with the now-defunct 2NE1. YG broke the mold after creating this group in my opinion. Smaller for a girl-group (only 4), they had a fairly unique sound and style all their own. Greatly helped by the lead CL. Overall they came off \u2018edgier\u2019 and with a lot more panache than most other ones. Each of the four also had fairly distinctive voices (though sometimes Minzy could sound a bit more like CL or Bom at times), so it was easy to follow who was singing what. Now, if you\u2019re looking at current k-pop (as 2NE1 is now gone), that\u2019s trickier. Technically I might have to go with Girls\u2019 Generation, as they\u2019re still coherent. Most of my favorites have disbanded. As I\u2019ve listed elsewhere, a current K-music group that is a true favorite is MFBTY. Not technically Kpop in that they aren\u2019t run by one of the big-3 k-music corps, and lean more heavily towards rap than \u2018pop\u2019. If you\u2019re not familiar with MFBTY, do look them up. Tiger J.K. (Aka Drunken Tiger), Yoon Mi Rae (aka Tasha, T, Baby T, Queen T, Gemini), and Bizzy. Tiger and Yoon are married and have a kid and are generally respected as the king and queen, or perhaps godfather and godmother of Korean Rap (unless that\u2019s changed recently). Both are phenomenal performers together and individually, fluent in Korean, English (and I think potentially Japanese). ",

(Logo is the one above) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014( They have an amazing discography, over 3:15 hours of music and they only officially debuted in 2018. Not only this but each song is so unique to the other, listen to Let me in by Haseul and then Egoist by Olivia Hye. Or listen to Hi High and then Butterfly. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Their concept is beautiful, there are other groups who tell stories via music (BTS, etc) but I have never seen a group do it like Loona. It\u2019s all so organized and elegant, they take lessons from the real world and from the Loonaverse and it\u2019s mindblowing how it all flows so nicely. It lets you learn about new things and see the world differently, I\u2019d never think that a song and video such as Vivid by Heejin would be so connected to a song and video released a year or so later One&Only by Gowon. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014( The way the girls were introduced was creative as hell, they were ahead of their time back in 2016 with Vivid. I loved the fact that Orbits had something to look forward to each month, the thrill of finally getting a new piece of Loona will always be dear to me.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014( The subunits are amazing. OEC, 1/3 and YYXY are so diverse in sound, looks, and message yet when you look deep they all intertwine so well. It\u2019s all so well done, OEC with their pop-ish and modern like sound, 1/3 was a nice homage to early girl groups and YYXY was dramatic, elegant, and cute. Each unit, each girl fit so well and when you see Loona all together it gives me chills to remember Mix&Match, Max&Match, Love&Live, Love&Evil, Beauty&TheBeat and then you see ++ and xx it\u2019s !!! They all compliment and show how diverse Loona, as a whole, is. ) YYXY | Yves, Chuu, Gowon & Olivia Hye  ) OEC | Kim Lip, Jinsoul & Cheorry  ) 1/3 | Heejin, Hyunjin, Haseul, Yeojin (She doesn\u2019t promote) & Vivi  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014( The message they send. Female empowerment, self-love, and so much more. They\u2019re also aware that they have a big LQBT+ following and avidly speak out about them. They\u2019re aware of trends we Orbits have and listen to us, and BBC does so too. Don\u2019t get me started on BBC, they\u2019re such a good company who listen to Loona and Orbits alike. They also recognize Orbits and their work, our complaints, everything we say feels like it reaches BBC and Loona. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014( Overall, Loona is ahead of their time with their message and music, it\u2019s sad to see how non-Orbits treat and see these girls. All 12 of them deserve the world and work their sanity off.  In conclusion; STAN TALENT, STAN LOONA. ",

For those who don't know, this is them:  But I already saw a very well written answer about them, so I'll answer about my second favorite. VIXX  I love VIXX! Their songs, concepts, members, styles and the way they show affection to eachother (aka the neck chops), they're so random and unique. You just can't help but feel drawn to them! But I have to admit, the thing I love the most about this group is that the members personalities are very different, yet they fit together and understand each other perfectly. For example, Leo and N are polar opposites. Leo gets shy easily and his personality comes off as serious and cold (ps. not true, he's a extra drama queen now a days), yet N is funny, outgoing and loud. But together, Leo teases N by rejecting him, which N counteracts with skinship or neck chops, but since N knows Leo is shy, he doenst try to push him further than that. I find that adorable, since when people know someone is shy they try to make them do things so that they aren't anymore. In their friendship you can tell that N doesn't ry to change Leo, he just accepts him how he is, and that is adorable. I also love how they know that Hyuk is a maknae on top, but they don't even try to stop him anymore. Its like they gave up completely XD. Ps. These are my favorite videos of them: Hyuk being evil:  Leo being extra (rare footage):  VIXX being\u2026 VIXX:  ",

At the first time I watched Haru Haru mv on television, I\u2019ve totally fall in love with their music. Then I started to google and watch all their video on youtube and I started to become addicted with their music. My favorite member in Big Bang is - T.O.P  I fall in love with his charisma voice and stunning visual. His rap is sick and personality is funny and weird. It is hardly to imagine a person with the face like this can be so childish and funny. He involved with songwriting and making lyrics on Big Bang song and we can know that he is talented.There are two favorite members that I loved in Winner - Kang Seung Yoon & Song Mino  I love Winner since the Who is Next: Win survival program by YG. In this program, they were competing with Ikon and only one group can debut.Winner are unlike other group like Big Bang and 2NE1 in YG Entertainment. Their music is not hip-pop at all which different with other group in the company. They compose their own songs mostly by leader Kang Seung Yoon and Mino are creative.They are very stable in performing live and always give 100% on stage to bring joy for their fans Inner Circle/in-seo. I\u2019ve attended their concert in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and they are so charming and stable in performing in live. Seung Yoon performed All of You by John Legend without any background music and his voice is flawless.I wish that they can earn more recognition and Winner always deserve better. Please spend 5 minutes to watch their live performance on youtube and you wont regret it. WINNER - \u2018REALLY REALLY\u2019 0409 SBS Inkigayo ",

Their japan debut song Suki to iwasetai and their latest song Violeta ( Those three are the Title tracks ). Not only their title tracks, the other songs are great also; Colours, Gokigen no Sayonara, Neko ni naritai, Really like you, up, and the others.

            "answer_text": "These are my four favorite k-pop groups ranked by preference: TWICESNSD (Girl\u2019s Generation)BLACKPINKMOMOLAND(Sorry for being such a girl group bias) Of course, my favorite songs are all from the groups above. As you can tell from my credential and from the list above, I\u2019m especially a big fan of TWICE, but surprisingly (spoiler alert), my overall favorite k-pop song isn\u2019t from TWICE. Anyway, here are my top 10 favorite k-pop songs: 10) What is Love?- TWICE  It was so hard to choose the top 10, and this was the lucky one out of many to barely make it into the list. It has an overall catchy beat that stands apart from other TWICE songs, and I especially love Dahyun and Chaeyoung\u2019s rap segment in this one. As a bonus, shoutout to Mr. JYP who produced this song! 9) Oh!- SNSD  SNSD songs are known for being extremely catchy, and this one is no different. The chorus of \u201cOh, oh, oh, oh!\u201d is the main highlight of the song that always gets stuck in my head whenever I listen to it. 8) BBoom BBoom- MOMOLAND  As the song that got me into K-pop in the first place, I can\u2019t describe how catchy and upbeat it is. My friend once said, it\u2019s \u201cthe song you can play at a party when everyone gets tired but the party must still go on and then they\u2019re all pumped up again.\u201d One of my favorite parts is the on-fire Daisy and JooE rap segment. After the massive success of \u201cBboom Bboom,\u201d I can\u2019t wait to see what MOMOLAND brings to the table next. 7) BOOMBAYAH- BLACKPINK  I wouldn\u2019t exactly call this \u201ccatchy,\u201d but it\u2019s very powerful and upbeat. The chorus isn\u2019t that great, but the buildup is amazing. Plus, Lisa\u2019s rap segment is one of the best in all of K-pop. Badass level: 130% 6) Heart Shaker- TWICE  Again, not really \u201ccatchy,\u201d but super upbeat. The entire song just blasts out energy everywhere. Enough said. 5) Genie- SNSD  First of all, I would like to point out that the song gives me Michael Jackson vibes, my favorite non k-pop artist. How do I describe the song itself? It isn\u2019t really catchy nor upbeat compared to the other songs on this list, but it\u2019s very refreshing. Undoubtedly the best part of this song is the final chorus at the end with Taeyeon\u2019s magnificent supporting vocals. 4) I GOT A BOY- SNSD  This song probably stands out the most from the other ones on the list. There are so many different parts to this song, which makes for a perfect combination of catchy, upbeat, and powerful- with amazing transitions in between. Some notable highlights include Tiffany\u2019s badass intro, Yoona+Hyoyeon\u2019s call-and-response rap segment, and Tiffany+Taeyeon\u2019s formidable solo part near the end. Badass level: 200% (Sorry BLACKPINK!) 3) Gee- SNSD  Yes, it\u2019s another one from the queens of k-pop. I don\u2019t think this song needs much explanation, but we can all agree it\u2019s a must-know classic. The reason why it\u2019s the legendary success it is today is because of just how catchy it is. In my honest opinion, it could be considered one of the catchiest songs of all time. The verse of \u201cGee gee gee gee,\u201d much like \u201cOh!,\u201d gets stuck in my head every time. I listen to this song multiple times a day and I never get bored of it. 2) Like OOH-AHH- TWICE  Considering the fact that it\u2019s their debut song, this is pretty impressive, eh? It showed the world what TWICE could bring to the table, and it was spectacular. From start to finish, it leaves you with no choice but to keep your earphones on. Mostly because it was their first song, it seemed like each member (except for Jeongyeon) got an equal opportunity to add her own unique voice to the song. Also, the chorus brings on so much energy I just want to dance to it all day long. (Unintentional rhyming right there) 1) AS IF IT\u2019S YOUR LAST- BLACKPINK  BLACKPINK in your area\u2026 Even though TWICE came close, my ultimate favorite song goes to BLACKPINK. This is the perfect summer jam. Firstly, each member got a lot of time to shine and provide their respective styles of singing. I absolutely love every single second of it from Jennie\u2019s refreshing intro, Ros\u00e9 and Jisoo\u2019s charismatic solo buildups, and Lisa\u2019s all-English, on-fire rap segment. But of course, we can\u2019t talk about this song without mentioning the outstanding chorus, which is the most prominent reason I love this song. It\u2019s too upbeat for it\u2019s own good (in a good way). Just blast this in the summer and all the heat will fly away! After this summer hit, I can\u2019t wait for their new comeback in two days\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I like a lot of groups, but right now, even if they\u2019re not my favorite, I have to mention SHINee and INFINITE. I have immense respect for both groups. SHINee is a veteran group. They\u2019ve been around for almost 10 years (2008 debut) and still have all the members and work hard for SM. They\u2019re still really popular, although Shawols aren\u2019t that caught up in raising their YouTube views, but they always sell well, get rewards and bring new sounds into the Kpop industry. All members get lines and work hard to improve. I\u2019d like to point to SHINee\u2019s Taemin; who\u2019s really popular solo as well, who used to just be the maknae, sub vocal, dance machine, but now has released solo albums. SHINee is a group I honestly think that you cannot objectively dislike. Even if you might not be a big fan, you have to respect them. They\u2019re different form all other idol groups. Then you have INFINiTE, who are extremely underrated. They have very strong vocals, dances and visuals. They\u2019re one of the top dancing groups, with dancing machines like Lee Ho-won of Hoya, which killed during Hit the Stage. They have a classic sound, so you can always recognize them. Just like SHINee they\u2019re one of the veteran groups. The band debuted in 2010 and is still going strong, with songs like The Eye. However, they\u2019re usually not nominated for MAMA\u2019s best choreography award, which is simply weird. I\u2019m pretty sure they nominated BIG BANG once. I mean, BIG BANG, I love them, but that\u2019s not right. Both groups are variety kings and have respectful fans. Jonghyun of SHINee even stepped down into the audience to let the fans touch him. The fans all stepped back, afraid that someone would hurt him, sassing fans, however, he said he wasn\u2019t afraid because he trusted his fans, and there are beautiful pictures of this. I\u2019ve always respected INFINITE, but I recently became an Inspirit, while I\u2019ve been a Shawol since I discovered the group in 2012. I am proud to call myself their fan. ",

I like 6 out of the 7 members which is pretty good. My bias is Jinyoung.Monsta x: they are literally so kind. I like all of the members. They all add something great to the team. Visuals!!! Singing but especially rapping! Bias is Wonho.Nct (U Dream and 127): amazing music. Hilarious people. Love the English speaking line. Great leader. Great sub units. Bias is Jaehyun.Exo: funny people. Love the members. I miss ot12. Amazing singing. Bias D.OSHINee: HILARIOUS group. Work well together. Rip Jonghyun. Bias Jonghyun. Current bias (I guess) is Taemin.I had to do 6 sorry! Nflying and FT island are both my number favorite too. Nflying has amazing music and have improved since hoeseung was added to the group. The group is filled with crazy people who deserve so much more attention. Amazing leader. FTisland is literally one of the most underrated group I have ever seen. They're music makes me cry, it is that good. Please check out FT island. They are so real (like SUJU) and they are so funny. (These groups are both bands not idol groups)Nflying Ft island ",

When I first got into kpop I didn't have any music service apps like Spotify or Pandora so I would just use youtube. I just made a huge playlist of kpop mvs amd videos of all the songs I like and a lot kf MVs would pop up on my youtube recommended page so I would watch a lot of them. One day Baam popped up on my reccomend page so I listened to it and I really liked it!! But even then I didn't really get into them. But one day a Momoland video from FBE popped up on my youtube where they did a try not to sing or dance challenge and I instantly fell in love. I automatically knew JooE would be my bias and I just loved them so much. I thought it would take a long time for me to learn there names since there's 9 of them but it barely took any time. At the point I stanned 4 other groups Red Velvet, Blackpink, Twice, and Gidle. (Still stan them all) I had stanned Momoland for about a week and realized they are my ults!  ",

NCT 127Their name is super awesome, the last 3 numbers are the coordinates of Seoul. How cool is that? SHINee\u201cOne who receives the light.\u201d I\u2019ll just leave that there. 2NE1The pronunciation itself is really interesting. Reps of the 21st century, I love that. IZ*ONENow I don\u2019t know if this is the actual meaning but: 12 members who become 1. I think that\u2019s a fantastic name. f(x)Now, my nerdy self loves this name but it actually means \u2018Flower Girls\u2019. F standing for \u2018flower\u2019 and x representing the female chromosome. Very clever. SF9\u2018Sensation Feeling\u2019 because they want to WOW everybody with their talent. Confidence, I like it. These are just some of many unique names, they all have a meaning behind it and I love that. <3 ",

            "answer_text": "My personal ultimate favorite groups are KARD, NCT and EXID, but objectively speaking I'm gonna say the best kpop group is\u2026 SEVENTEEN. Their music style is consistent and they always come out with good and unique songs that set the trends instead of following them. Sub-unit songs have their own flavour to them and are all well made. Their dancing skills are unprecedented in the industry \u2014 they are very synchronised and not only are their main dancers talented but their vocalists and rappers are also very skilled at dancing. Those same vocalists all have unique vocals and the rap line is very well balanced when it comes to different rap styles. They have the visuals and are fun to watch on variety shows. They seem naturally close and fun to be around. They all have a strong stage presence and are well rounded as individual idols. Their album sales are among the highest in the industry. They always get many wins on music shows or award shows at the end of the year. They're creative, humble and hard-working. Even though they're not one of my so-called \u201cult\" groups I realize that SVT is a group that is outstanding in every aspect that we say define a good kpop group. They're well rounded and that's what sets them apart from other groups who all have their weak spots (which is completely normal!). In conclusion, stan SVT! ",

Meaning this is totally objective. All facts, no opinions, just bam(bam), the gayest ship in Kpop. You think this is a joke?! It\u2019s not! Seyjin. Seyong x Chaejin, from MyName. Some weird fans call the ship name Sejin, but we\u2019re going to pretend those people don\u2019t exist. As I mentioned, my answer will be totally objective, meaning Seyjin is certainly the right way to refer to them. All facts, no opinions!   Look at that gay hug. Adorable. But Kpop idols gayly hug each other all the time. What makes Seyjin so special? Well, dear reader, I would explain, but it\u2019s better to just show you. You must watch this video. That\u2019s not a polite request, it\u2019s a demand. You want OTP, you get OTP, and this video is OTP.  You\u2019ll surely agree with my objective facts that they are the ultimate OTP after watching this video. I rest my case. Edit: PLEASE ENJOY THESE BONUS GIFS THANK YOu    ",

EXO has won many awards in the world. More than anything, they are dance and singing voice makes me exciting. i think if you hook a EXO, you gave him your earnings, so did I. they are very famous in Japan. crazy love and spend a lot of many Japanese teenager who likes EXO. For example, my friend bought 150 CDs so that she could get 150 lottery tickets to go to its concert. I really recommend to EXO!!! Maybe you can find your type members. ",

            "answer_text": "My absolute favorite Kpop group of all time is NCT. I really click with their music, especially their B-sides and all of NCT Dream\u2019s discography. They can always cheer me up and make me smile. I LOVE their humor and personalities. Life in Neo City is never boring, there\u2019s always something happening. I also really appreciate how multilingual and diverse they are, and how their Youtube videos are almost always uploaded with English subtitles. :DNCT 127 (Seoul based unit)  NCT Dream (teenage unit)  WayV (Chinese unit)  2. My second favorite Kpop group is Stray Kids. I\u2019m actually not into their music so much, I\u2019m only a casual listener. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m mostly there for the chaos. They are such a young group so I can relate to them as a young person myself. I just love how\u2026 weird they are lmao. And they are ridiculously open minded and accepting. Bang Chan especially makes me feel so comforted and safe, I love watching his Vlives.   3. After NCT and Stray Kids, I\u2019d say some other groups I like are Seventeen, Pentagon, Mamamoo, 1Team, Twice, Red Velvet and TXT: Seventeen: Their title tracks always SLAP. I love how they do more playful concepts than other bgs. The dancing is always next level. I don\u2019t know much about the members, but so far I really like Vernon, Woozi, Joshua, and Seungkwan.  Pentagon: Also such good music, I love their more playful concepts like Shine, Humph, and Naughty Boy so much. I don\u2019t really know much about the members, but I love their music. Hui\u2019s voice is amazing.  Mamamoo: Their vocals are AMAZING omg also I have a massive crush on Moonbyul lmfao.  1Team: new group, but so far I\u2019ve loved every single song. Go listen to Vibe if you haven\u2019t already.  Red Velvet: I don\u2019t know much about the members, but I love a lot of their title tracks and they\u2019re on my playlist.  Twice: I also don\u2019t know much about the members, but their title tracks SLAPPPPP omigod. They\u2019re so catchy.  TXT: I don\u2019t think they have that magical chemistry that I look for in a group to STAN stan yet, but I do think they have some solid title tracks under their belt, and their dancing is so underrated.  So yeah these are some of the groups I like! xoxo ",

Also, they all have distinct personalities that compliment eachother which I really like because tbh I love a variety and difference of personalities. Last but not least: TXT\u2019s music. Their whole discography is amazing and I NEVER skip one single track because I love each song so much. (A/N: Sorry if this explanation makes no sense, I suck at explaining things..oops) Another one of my ults is NCT, (mostly NCT Dream but I love the other units as well huhu) but I won\u2019t go into detail because I will never stop talking about it.

I\u2019ve been a BTS army since 2017 and is really happy to see all their hard work from the past 6 years really pay off these recent years. I\u2019ve been to their concert once and just loves many, many BTS songs. Their latest EP released in April contains amazing 7 songs. I became a TXT fan before their debut as they are also under Big Hit. After TXT released their debut album, I really fell in love with all 5 songs as they are so fresh and unique. I became a stay quite recently after really liking their hits Hellevator and District 9. Three members write all of their songs, and I just like Stray Kids\u2019 unique, addictive music genre. As I listen to basically only male group songs, I don\u2019t particular \u2018really love\u2019 any K-pop female group. I do like Mamamoo (best vocals), (G)I-dle\u2019s music, and watches Twice on variety shows from time to time. ",

For me personally, I think that EXO or NCT are the best, only because they\u2019re the two who I follow the most.

You may have heard the statement \u201cSTAN LOONA\u201d before, but do you know why those \u201cannoying\u201d Orbits repeatedly say this? It is because the band is so unique with their \u201cnever-before-done\u201d concept and their distinctive sound but is underrated in South Korea. They work hard, they love their fans, they have expressed women\u2019s rights in their recent song, expressed LGBT topics in their songs, and have very sharp choreography, too! ",

Plus, EXO was able to make me appreciate other music genres that I never liked before. I think they\u2019re a good group of guys and I have more of a personal connection to them and their music more so than other artists. They\u2019re also funny and I love watching them interact on variety shows and with fans. Plus, I always look forward to their random lives on IG as they always make me relax and smile \u2014like when Baekhyun and Sehun went live on Suho\u2019s new IG. Poor Suho, though. Sehun still hasn\u2019t followed him yet. [insert laughing here] (Although, there are plenty of amazing and talented k-pop groups I have yet to discover. I am just pointing out my personal favorite.)

I mean they're way more hardworking than others cuz as kpop industry is enormous and stars countless idols, they do need to work more and more to stand out worldwide but they certainly do it really well. I love their passion for their work , their enthusiasm, dedication, all which is needed to make up an IDOL. And group,well well, when it comes to groups, nothing comes in my mind other than EXO ofcourse. They are so talented and hardworking, which makes it even more appealing to stan them. There is absolutely nothing they lack, well it's a true fact though that there ain't any rappers in EXO but that never creates a problem cuz their strong vocals cover it up really well. And the visuals of EXO members (let's say all 12, including LuHan, Kris and Tao), are pretty attractive. They're all really pleasing to look at. Apart from professional life, as individuals they're much more , full of aegyo and fun loving., which is completely my style. I LOVE EXO. and then some other groups I like are BTS , Girl's Generation, SHINee, Super Junior, Infinite . They're all great artists, contributing beautiful music to the world. ",

I listened to alot of their songs but I felt like it wasn\u2019t my style. So I checked out more groups and then I came across BLACK ON BLACK. I just loved how good the dance moves were and Taeyong, Mark, and Lucas\u2019 raps were sooo good! I checked out KICK IT, LIMITLESS, WE GO UP (one of my faves now) and more! Their concepts are amazing! I don\u2019t know why people hesitate to stan this group cause of the limitless amount of members. And now here I am, my ult group is now nct, used to be bts but yea. ",

I know they\u2019ve gotten a lot of hate before, even got boycotted on the 2008 Dream Concert, but they became known as the Nation\u2019s Girl Group and probably can still be considered as is. What was remarkable about them throughout the years was their bond and diversity. You\u2019ve got a lot of dramas going on within the group that was pretty evident also. But working with a bunch of people, there\u2019s always drama that\u2019s bound to happen. It\u2019s just something we wouldn\u2019t know as a person from the outside. The only thing that did break it for them was when OT9 became OT8. Some people have moved on from what happened and just learned to accept what was given to them but there are those, which one of them includes myself, that haven\u2019t moved on from it and are still very curious about what actually happened. Nevertheless, I\u2019m happy to see each member relaxing more now and venturing out of Girls\u2019 Generation as individuals. You still see the bond they have every now and then, especially with the recent collaboration they have together for DJ Hyo\u2019s Dessert. ",

Their music just really clicked with me from the very start and having heard pretty much every song they ever released, I would say that its pretty credible. They have a large fan base so sometimes I (guiltily) aren't as active as I should be as an EXO-L but their talent, personality and viduals make them one of my bias groups. Their vocals are also really strong and by bias Chen is a main vocalist which means I can support their music but expecially their vocals :) Seventeen is a group that I've just gone around to bias rather recently. Their personality and chemistry with each of the other members (especially with 13 members) is really legit and nice. I feel like I can relate to them on a personal level in terms of personality and their choreography and songs being self produced? Makes me support them even more!!! I also like the notion of subunits for each of the main categories. ",

Their lyrics speak for themselves, and I just find them really funny. From their start with No More Dream to their recent collaboration with Steve Aokis (Waste It On Me), I can say without a doubt that BTS is the hottest KPop idol group right now. Remember to stan all 7 #ot7BigBang- They\u2019re known as the kings of Kpop, and for good reason. I only recently found out about them, ironically when 3 of them have enlisted already, but listening to their songs have made me see Kpop differently. Hits like Fantastic Baby and Bang Bang Bang are bangers that I never skip when it comes on shuffle, and it\u2019s worth noting that they were formed because of their abilities, and not just looks. Can\u2019t wait for their comeback when they\u2019re back from military, hopefully in the next few years.",

Not just that, they\u2019re also hilarious, both on variety shows and in the videos they film of themselves; they\u2019re always up to something, whether it\u2019s making up raps on the spot, doing silly dances or just having impromptu karaoke competitions in the back of their van. The three singers can rap, and the rapper has a beautiful singing voice too.

I watched a documentary series that they were a part of before they debuted, and I was so impressed by how hard working they were and how different the kpop industry was compared to Hollywood. Through that documentary series, I also got to see their personalities. Then, I watched their music videos for \u201cShining Diamond\u201d and \u201cAdore U\u201d and I couldn't help but fall in love! My bias changed at least 3 times during all of this, my first bias was Vernon and then it changed to Jun (because I was really digging the long dark hair on him) and then, during \u201cMansae era\u201d, Mingyu came out of nowhere, completely destroyed my bias list, and stood on top (He's still on top to this day). Their visuals got my attention, their music got me to stay, and their personalities got me to fall in love! ",

Four of the members are on the unit, whilst one of them is in a group formed by produce 101 called jbj.Topp Dogg is really special to me, although it isn\u2019t my favourite group, which is why I need to include Seventeen into this. Seventeen are from an entertainment agency is really hate, called Pledis. I\u2019m so surprised they didn\u2019t flop right off the bat. Which is why I\u2019m actually shook with this group sometimes. Just as Topp Dogg, they\u2019re extremely talented. Choices I almost chose: Super Junior, EXO, VIXX, BigBang, 2Ne1, Sistar, Got7 ",

They have showed me that only I can make up the rules for my life. That I need to live myself before I can love others. They showed me the meaning of self worth. They have helped though many problems. If I felt down I would play BTS. I normally don't like socialising with people I get really uncomfortable. Infant I really hate it. Of there are too many people around me I get really faint. One time I passed out. BTS help my confidence. I would play there sings while I sit in front if the mirror telling myself how much I love myself. How I have done a good job in everything. How I am so beautiful. They have helped me so much. At this point they are my reasons for living. I may sound like a saesang but I'm not. I care about all the members. Even if I don't meet them at least I know they'll always be there for me. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s easy. EXO. I tried to get into other kpop groups out there but they just aren\u2019t the same as EXO to me. For instance the chemistry between the members, the type of music, the performances they put on or how I connect with the members just aren\u2019t the same. However, I do like listening to other groups, I have a few BTS songs on my playlist along with one bigbang song, one Monsta X song, one Got7 song. It really depends on the group itself and whether I enjoy their music, if I only listen to the one song I usually don\u2019t find myself going further into the group itself just admiring them from afar whereas if I listen to numerous songs then I take a bit more interest. It\u2019s odd though because for some groups I like the members more than their songs for example: Got7, Monsta X & others, I only have hard carry on my playlist yet I still find myself liking the members, does that make me a fake kpop fan because of it? I don\u2019t think so but I do feel like I should like more songs to become a proper fan of a group. ",

Yes they are a lot of firsts for me :) Since then I have been loving them and supporting them through lot of ups and downs. It\u2019s not only their music or performance talents I like about. It\u2019s also their chemistry with each other, fans and just simply their personalities, which are very diverse.Originally they used to be 12 member group under SM entertainment. Basically 2 big subgroups EXO-K and EXO-M, for Korean and Mandarin. But eventually things happened and now it\u2019s only 9 members with EXO. They are right now a quadrauple million seller with one of the biggest fanbases called EXO-L. Above all they are a group of boys passionate about whatever they do and it proves how long they have come so far.  ",

Onew is an amazing vocalist and he can also do opera  Jonghyun also has amazing and unique vocals  He is an amazing performer  Taemin is an amazing singer too  Minho and Key are rappers and they\u2019re very good rapper but they can also sing really good too!  They also have amazing choreographies    Another reason is their amazing stage presence     Also their songs are really good but they aren\u2019t \u201cmainstream\u201d type music if you know what I mean???      They have lots of different genres!! Another reason is that they are really funny 0:00-0:30  In conclusion there is no other group/band that can do it like SHINee. SHINee are different to all other kpop groups it\u2019s hard to explain why but they are. Also their fans (ShaWols) are extremely kind and like a family. They are one of the best fandoms. Btw if you meant band as in a band that plays instruments then my favourite band is probably ftisland or day6 :) ",

They're hysterically funny and very talented. B.A.P The group was just a fingertip away from greatness when their agency screwed them. They are mindblowingly awesome and deserve much more than they're getting. WINNER talented, handsome IKON so much talent. 2NE1 Yes, they're gone but they will forever be the best for me.

And when they're performing together, non of the members outshine each other - a well balanced group indeed.

I suggest if you want to watch their videos, watch No More Dream their first song debuted. All members really participate in every songs they'll release. Bangtan boys made their songs by their own, so all hard work and things they've done are really worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend dipping your toes in at first and reviewing some of the popular groups first. This might prepare you for the incoming storm of emotions. BTS, Blackpink and Twice would probably be the representative groups of this generation of K-pop. They\u2019re well known, even outside of K-pop. With international and domestic popularity, they thrive with some signature concepts, but also have unexpected releases. BTS\u2019s most friendly eras would be their newer songs from 2017\u20132020. Songs as Spring Day, DNA, Fake Love and Boy with Luv are generally songs that appeal to the majority of music listeners. Most of Blackpink\u2019s discography are \u201chit song\u201d material. You can find old school concepts, like Boombayah or Whistle if you like hip hop. Their newer releases are very catchy and lie under the genre of Pop Music. Ddu Ddu Ddu Ddu and Kill This Love are very popular and recent releases. Twice is more known for their cute and girly concept, but recently experimented with an elegant and mature concept. TT, Cheer Up and Ooh Ah seem to be the type of songs Twice gained the majority of their fanbase through. Recently, they released Fancy and Feel Special. A deeper dive into K-pop would take you through Red Velvet, Seventeen, NCT, EXO and many others! I hope my answer is helpful. Enjoy browsing through these groups and let\u2019s all be sensible on the internet! ",

They are doing this thing in which every month in 2017 they would release a song. Plus they doa variety of genres so their must be something you like. One of my favorite songs are \u201c\"I Wait\u201d and \u201cHi Hello\u201d. Anyways Day6 is the band I like and I am proud to be an MyDay! ",

In my opinion, none of their songs are songs that I would skip if they happened to appear on a playlist on Spotify. I like that none of their songs sound similar, which is difficult to come by in kpop. Monsta X, I liked Shootout and Hero, but also their personalities. I enjoy the content and compilations made of them. EXO, they caught my attention when they were on Knowing Brothers, playing the game where they wear headphones and shout at each other. They\u2019re hilarious, without even trying. ",

I say this because Got7\u2019s choreography is better put together than most and the scene transitions are extraordinairily smooth, while Black Pink and BTS are also extremely well put together Got7 has the best choreography lining up with the beats of the music. Black Pink is very unique puts a good amount of surprise and color and the group members always give off an \u201caura\u201d of confidence (most female kpop groups do), more so than the boy kpop groups of Got7 and BTS. BTS is extraordinarily good at making lyrics of their songs, and don\u2019t forget the settings! BTS certainly goes more extreme with their sets than Black Pink or Got7 and has more spunk, thought, and time into making the lyrics of their songs and sets. But, in the end this is really all your choice and this is just my opinion, so whatever kpop group tickles your fancy I guess! ;p! ",

Its disrespectful, degrading, and it basically says you don't matter as a sentient being. Yes it is that deep. ",

SongsOk, their songs are another selling point. If you watch their MV alone, you might not understand WHY they use that background, why they dress like that and what not. But once you look at the lyrics, you will understand and I was so touched by the meaning behind \u2018Spring Day\u2019.. T.T Someone help me.. PersonalitiesBTS is stanned also for their kindness. They help those in need, and they keep promises. They work harder everyday because they think they owe it to us ARMYs who voted for them (Uhm.. not like crazy..) and helped them win numerous awards. BTS is also funny, cute and they\u2019re daring. They\u2019re brave. They dare to do things people don\u2019t because they have been through tough times and know if they don\u2019t do it NOW, they might not be able to again. Overall, BTS is an AMAZING group and I don\u2019t, and NEVER will, regret stanning them!  ",

I get into the fandom late, but I am still supporting the individuals and happy that they are getting the recognition for their hard work all these times. 2. X1 - haven\u2019t debuted yet. Formed by the same way with Wanna One, through Produce 101 series. Announced the final line up on 19 July 2019, they are now preparing their debut in 27 August 2019 in Gocheok Dome (just like Wanna One). I am excited to see how they\u2019ll turn out, especially the line-up got some amazing trainees too.  3. BTOB - one of my main favorites. Not exactly stanning them, but I do like them and every single song they have ever released. A truly talented group with amazing members.  4. iKON - amazing, talented group too. Too bad YG had to ruined them and kick Hanbin out. Someone save them from YG):  5. Victon - recently discovered them after Han Seungwoo and Choi Byungchan joining Produce X 101. They are truly amazing, too. I like the whole group chemistry. Seungwoo is currently joined X1, so I will see how they will promote with 6 members only.  ",

            "answer_text": "According to me, right now at this very moment BTS is one of the bestest K-Pop band and I am not saying this because of the fame that they have received but because of their humble and down to earth nature. Their lyrics speak the honest truth and reflect their passion for music. Not only this, they are always ready to give love to their fans and they do get equivalent love from their fans called as ARMY. So it's a vice versa deal. Offcourse, different people can like different bands but for me genuinely BTS is one of the bestest band because of the way they are and their music is totally LIT. There is something for everyone in their songs. All you gotta do is listen to their songs without any bias or any thought and you'll definitely find something worth it. ",

TXT Tomorrow X Together is fairly new but their songs are catchy, they come from the same company as BTS (BigHit) EXO I don\u2019t listen to them that often as the others but they definitely have some cool songs and are a pretty decent group! I really hope this helps, I can also recommend some songs by them too\u2026 \u2022Mic Drop-BTS \u2022Boy with luv-BTS \u2022Cat & Dog TXT \u2022CROWN TXT \u2022For life- EXO I hope this answers your question and helps :) Also when you are recommending it to someone go in that order of groups (BTS, TXT, and EXO) ",

If you are looking for good music, then I'd suggest any YG Entertainment group. They have really good songs. But I have to say this, YG's Music Videos are Waaay Out of the Box!. Some of the groups under YG entertainment: 1. Big Bang(Fantastic Baby, Good Boy, Sober, Bang Bang Bang) 2. 2NE1(Iam the Best, Come Back Home, Happy, Go Away) 3. Akdong Musician(each and every song) 4. EXID (Not YG BTW) If you are looking for good visuals, choreography, music then the following are the few groups I suggest 1. BTS (Dope, Fire,Save Me) 2. Girls Generation(Oh, Run Devil Run, I got a Boy) 3. Seventeen(Very Nice, Mansae) 4. EXO(Growl, Monster, Overdose) 5. Twice(Cheer Up, Ooh Aah) There are more, but the above are the best.

In my opinion, BTS has gone farther than a lot of K-Pop groups becoming well known in the states and worldwide. They each have their own unique and loving personality which I think makes the Bangtan Boys stand out from the rest. Let's not forget their talent and looks. They were the reason I fell for K-Pop, and that was because of their awesome singing and dancing abilities and as I got to know them I couldn't let go.They have come so far and have achieved so much that hey deserve our love.There is so much more I can say about them but my fingers are too tired to type at 9:30 pm. lolSo is BTS your favorite K-Pop group, or do you think there's a group that tops them?

A simple scream from them could move the whole audience like a wave. They were there when kpop aren't as recognised as it is right now. They were the ones responsible for bringing kpop to where it is now. They're extremely talented as well! Back then we just have to admit they don't have those good looks everyone likes. Somehow they became legends. This just proved how much they put their efforts into their music that kpopers didn't care about their looks. This just showed how powerful and big BIGbang is. ",

            "answer_text": "At first, when I was a K-Pop newbie freshly introduced, I listened to Blackpink(because why would I need any other group?). Mostly the title tracks, but when I looked at their B-sides, turns out that there aren\u2019t that many B-sides either. Then I discovered Twice through \u2018What is Love\u2019, and let\u2019s just say that I wasn\u2019t very impressed with their former cute concept. \u2018Fancy\u2019 was an addicting song, and \u2018Feel Special\u2019 had a very meaningful message. My interest dropped after that though. Now, Red Velvet is my one true love\u2014I love all of their title tracks, their B-sides, and I have downloaded so many of their albums you can\u2019t even count (I\u2019m in China, so a QQ music VIP really helps cuz you can listen to their songs without purchasing). Mamamoo follows at a close second. I\u2019m still building up my EXO playlist, but I can confirm that it\u2019s going to be as huge a collection as Red Velvet. I mean, when close to 80 songs in your inventory are from RV it isn\u2019t exactly speedy to build another collection, you know? Have a Yeri because I love this queen so much:  And sometimes you just need short haired Yeri to save your day. ~S. ",

I say I was just about to do that when I found this: The casual use of \u201cstan\u201d famously comes from Eminem and Dido\u2019s hit 2000 song of the same name, in which the rapper weaves a harrowing yarn about an obsessive fan trying to get his attention. Nas helped spread the term, rhyming in his 2001 diss track against Jay-Z \u201cEther,\u201d \u201cYou a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan.\u201d \u201cHis is the first recorded usage of \u2018stan\u2019 as a label (and a pejorative one) for an obsessive fan rather than the name of the fan himself,\u201d as The Outline noted in 2017. Over the years, \u201cstan\u201d has morphed into a go-to slang term for diehard fans and was added [unbefuckinglievably] to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017.[1] Bloody hell.

He worked with BigBang, Psy, winner, ikon etc. Basically genius in his own way. I know a lot of people hate them for stupid reasons. They're not overhyped. Every artist is famous as much as he should be. They have one of my favorite beat drops and instrumentals in kpop. I adore it. Vocals and rap parts are good too. And they can dance ofcourse. People say that fandom is toxic. Just for a record let me fix y'all not a fandom, but toxic stupid fans. ",

I'm sure the first group needs no introduction, but nonetheless - BTS (aka \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8, meaning Bulletproof Boy Scouts) is a 7-member group under the company Big Hit Entertainment, comprised of rappers Suga, Rap Monster and J-Hope, and vocalists Jin, Jungkook, Jimin and V. My biases in this group (yes, I have two) are Jin and Suga. I first fell in love with Suga through the intense rap of Never Mind, and Jin kinda just came out of nowhere with his gorgeous visuals and beautiful vocals.  And as for Pentagon, they are a 10-member group, made up of vocalists Yanan, Jinho, Hui, Shinwon, Hongseok, Yeo One and Kino, and rappers E'Dawn, Wooseok and Yuto. My bias in this group is Shinwon, mostly because I just find his personality adorable, but he has a nice face too. They're from Cube Entertainment, and 100% worth checking out if you haven't already.  (Yanan is missing from this photo due to injury.) ",

Their music really touched my heart and so I started loving them more and more. The first Exo song I heard was \u2018Growl\u2019)Bts (I joined the fandom in early 2015. They were the 3rd band I was introduced to. I love their music because it\u2019s all relatable. \u2018Save Me\u2019 was my first Bts song)Vixx (I was introduced to them after Exo. After joining the fandom I got to know the reason they are called \u2018Concept Gods\u2019. This is a well-known fact so no-one can argue with me. \u2018Error\u2019 their song about cyborgs was lit and my first Vixx song)Seventeen (I joined the fandom in 2017 with the song \u2018Clap\u2019. Their music is lit and also the choreography is amazing as they choreograph their own dances)",

Have you even heard about this said group?Like many artists, they have talent 1 and 2, and 3, and 4, and this and that\u2026The group is the rare gem that still persist as a Kpop group without solid considerable fandom or decent attention/coverage or established agency since 2011.I always vow for the underdog.",

I first fell in love with V because of his voice, but when I got to know the members a bit more I changed to Min Suga. His amazing voice, his talent and his big heart for music is just amazing.

Were the first Asian group to perform in West and much more). But now as many members left for the military services they have lost a big part of their fame as of course the group had no activities for many years. Well for these days EXO and BTS are of course very famous. However since SUPER JUNIOR has released their album play and has performed SS7 they have started gaining back their lost fame. ",

Everyone (for the most part) is hardworking. Everyone tries to be unique too (but I\u2019m biased and find some groups generic). Everyone wants to work to the point of being the best too. So I don\u2019t think comparing work ethic will determine who is the best. Not everyone is capable of producing, writing, or choreographing either, so I can\u2019t compare that and say someone\u2019s the best. A lot of the people I enjoy do aid in the process or do it themselves, so I\u2019m biased in that. So yeah, I can\u2019t really pick a best. ",

            "answer_text": "Red Velvet - They have many unique concepts for every song, due to the fact that the Red in Red Velvet means boldness and Velvet means smooth and silky. They have gotten on the chart the most times, they are really good. The members are Joy, Yeri, Irene, Seulgi, and Wendy. I recommend the songs \u201cIce Cream Cake\u201d and \u201cBad Boy\u201d Twice - Twice is the cutesy type of group; they have cuteness in every song, serious or bubbly. Twice and Blackpink are near competitors, they\u2019re both really famous. Twice\u2019s songs, in my opinion, kind of sound like anime introductions. They are phenomenal, and I definitely recommend them. The members are Sana, Momo, Mina, Jihyo, Tzuyu, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, Nayeon, and Jeongyeon. I recommend the songs \u201cWhat is Love?\u201d and \u201cTT\u201d (\u201cTT\u201d is a to-be-continued song and the song \u201cKnock Knock\u201d completes the story). EXID - EXID used to be one of those hidden bands and they were so unpopular that they were about to disband. A fancam showing their most popular member, Hani, at a concert performing \u201cUp & Down\u201d went viral and saved them from disbandment. They are really excellent; they have one of the best vocals from Solji and Hyerin, breathtaking visuals from Jeonghwa and Hani, killer rap from LE, and energetic dancing from Jeonghwa and LE. I recommend the songs \u201cUp & Down\u201d, \u201cAh Yeah\u201d, and \u201cL.I.E\u201d. (Note: Hani and Jeonghwa are not renewing their contracts and are leaving after \u201cMe&You\u201d promotions are finished). Gfriend - Gfriend always brings you sad songs from a girlfriend\u2019s perspective. Their music and choreography is hands down really good. The members are Sowon, Yerin, Eunha, Yuju, SinB, and Umji. I recommend the songs \u201cSunrise\u201d, \u201cTime for the moon night\u201d, and \u201cNavillera\u201d. **THIS IS FROM A GIRL GROUP STAN\u2019S PERSPECTIVE** ",

Non-fans may think they\u2019re fake, arrogant or whatever (I used to think so too when I wasn\u2019t a sone), but when you give them a chance you realize how an amazing group of talented, hardworking and lovable women they are. I could write lines and lines of texts about how they not only broke the status quo by becoming a successful girl group with a huge fandom in a sea of boy groups but also became cultural icons in South Korea (which is one of the reasons so many younger girls have them as their role models), but instead, I\u2019ll just say you should check their reality shows (like Hello Baby, Channel SNSD or their appearances on Running Man) and their albums, especially their japanese stuff. No way you won\u2019t fall for them - I mean, there\u2019s a reason they still have so many fans after a decade in the game, after all :) Useful links: SNSD Variety Show IndexList of SNSD\u2019s Records and Achievements",

If you looked at income of the companies you will see which bands are the most popular but sometimes popularity doesn't mean they are the best. And of course there will be older Kpop bands who aren't listened to as much but were good in their time so it's hard to say which band is the best. ",

Amazing songs. Stan them. F(x)- I love their style and their music. Wish they were more active tho. Blackpink- Love their music and just love them in general. Can't wait for their comeback.

I would say that EXO is definitely the most popular in Asia though. I am an international fan so I don't exactly know what is going on there but In America if you go and ask someone who listens to music (any type) and ask if they know any of their songs they could tell you a few of their songs. A girl group that is trending right now is Black Pink. Most of my friends have heard of them and they don't even know what K-pop is. However, I don't know about the most popular of all time. It'd probably have to be Big Bang. Anyone who listens to Kpop even if they are not a fan of big bang will be able to tell you the names of some of their songs. I don' know about best girl group though. ",

Before getting into Bts, I was very picky with what music I listened to, or just wouldn't listen to music altogether because I was just bored with what I was listening to all the time. Eventually, I became more observant to lyrics and their meanings and other music artists instead of listening to the same ones.. ",

He always makes me laugh when I see him in NCT content and he just reminds me of a little brother. Haechan- NCT  I like Haechan because of his singing voice. He also can dance very well to not be part of the dance line of NCT. Honestly if I met him in person I would not want to be his friend because from what I see, his personality doesn\u2019t really fit well with my personality.

They dance awesome too cause I am mostly into dances. They also kind, humble, and gentle except suga as he is known as the cold member of the group but then he is sweet from inside. Blackpink I like they cause they are cute and act like 5 year old kids. They are humorous. They are funny and good people to be around with. There music is also cool but then they are not as active as the other kpop groups. They are also humble and kind. They are also good at dancing and Lisa is the best. She is my bias. So is just like a kid and cool and can be a good friend of yours. Hope this will help your answer. ",

That\u2019s why I love bts the most. BL\u039b\u0186KPI\u0418K reasons; They debuted in 8 Aug 2016. For one year in 2017, I dislike BL\u039b\u0186KPI\u0418K because I always like that. In this year 2018, I forced myself to like BL\u039b\u0186KPI\u0418K. They are very sexy among the others kpops girls. Their looks are so cute and pretty. But others girls also pretty, wat?!

There definitely IS an obsession at first with only ONE, it lasts a few months, even 6 months or more for some people. I realised that I was comparing them to others even without getting into other groups and having a listen to them. Then I eventually discovered EXO, by listening to their song: CALL ME BABY, an ultimate hit! NCT popped up and now I am into all three mostly, still I also like Red Velvet, Blackpink, Astro and am starting to recognise other groups as well. But being an ultimate fangirl, I would go for BTS, EXO & NCT! ",

Their beginnings are also interesting because it was one of their serious moments (NO MERCY era) NCT I also love NCT so much <3 Tbh their units and stuff are not hard to understand lmao so give them a chance if you haven\u2019t yet. NCT DREAM is the most superior unit (you can\u2019t change my mind), all of their songs are good. Other units\u2019 songs are good too although I dislike some of their non-title-track songs.

Super Junior - because they\u2019re derpy and ridiculous and meme worthy but also very talented even if not all their songs are fantastic. Day 6 - an actual legit band of talented dudes who constantly experiment and grow. B1A4 - more dorks with dorky songs, dorky videos, just lots of fun to watch and listen to and their most recent stuff shows more growth, maturity, and experimentation. ",

I just like how they interact with fans and the songs they self-produce. And they find time to have fun on variety shows. You have no idea how happy they have made me. ",

Also I have this weird attachment with them its hard to explain but my love for them as you woud expect would slowly fade over a year or two but no I have love them more and more everyday.

No one wants to go against them when they promote a song. TVXQ are the most popular boy group, still, in Japan. EXO is really popular in Korea, and to a certain extent, China. BTS is super hyped in the USA. For girl groups, I would say Blackpink and Twice. However, SNSD are more respected and well known in the older generations because they were one of the first girl groups and one of the oldest groups that haven\u2019t disbanded. In the past, H.O.T., G.O.D., Shinhwa, BAP, BTOB, 2ne1, F(x), Wonder Girls, Sechskies, Super Junior, Shinee, KARA, Brown Eyed Girls, FTIsland, etc. were really popular. ",

They became a hot topic among western and international celebrities.  Kudos to their team for their brilliant marketing strategy and hardworks. Other Kpop groups can learn from them too. The best thing about BTS is that they sing in Korean, their own language and don\u2019t even bother to sing in English and yet, are loved by western listeners. Other Kpop acts who wanna make it big, please take note from BTS. ",

They explore different concepts, dances and styles in their music. K-pop isn\u2019t all about pop or bubblegum pop, the groups above mentioned have songs in hip-hop, ballads and jazz and are recommended for beginners to Kpop music. ",

Next for the girl group i'll suggest BLACKPINK which is a 4 member girl group consisting of Jennie ,Jisoo, Lisa and Ros\u00e9. Their songs are just awesome and they've slayed each era and their visuals are also quite beautiful. ",

For me, I didn\u2019t know Psy was the start of K-pop growth in the U.S. Because Gangnam Style came out when I was in 7th-8th grade. When I got into K-pop, BTS was who came to mind first. Even though I wasn\u2019t familiar with the genre itself. But any group you enjoy their music, learn about the group, watch variety shows they\u2019re featured on, etc\u2026learn about each member, choose your bias (favorite member), and keep on listening to them. So, in summary. All of the active K-pop groups that are growing internationally, are the best. Learn why they\u2019re making such an impact on the world. Learn about what are they doing and what makes them so unique. ",

The letters (E and X and O) and the imagination behind the group name appeals me a lot. NCT I just like the matching of the 3 letters\u2026. EVERGLOW Has a magical vibe to the name. DREAM CATCHER A very fancy and rare name for a group. TXT The meaning, \u201cTomorrow X Together\u201d is a forever together kind of thing. TWICE A simple but rather posh name in different views. ",

That being said, overall I personally believe that Shinhwa holds the title of very best, but that\u2019s based on what I consider the best. If you meant vocals then I think Stellar is pretty well good in that category. I don\u2019t listen to Exo, but I think they would probably take the award for most attractive. If you mean best by being all around good, then either A.C.E or Monsta x. But these are all groups that I consider the best, everyone has different preferences, and every group has different skills, so there really is no such thing as the best group. ",
