            "answer_text": "There are a few reasons but this totally varies from person to person. Many people dislike kpop because it\u2019s Korean. Their reasons are something like \u201cYou don\u2019t even understand what they are saying\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point if you don\u2019t the language etc. But music is a universal language. Even if you don\u2019t understand what they are saying, you can feel the emotions.  Then we have plastic surgery. Many people criticize kpop idols for having plastic surgery. Well, it\u2019s true some idols do. But does it really affect the music they are producing? The answer is no. The kpop industry has high expectations for looks so some idols may feel like they need to fit within the beauty standards. SO, it\u2019s completely their choice. People also don\u2019t like how guys wear makeup. It\u2019s part of their culture. It\u2019s perfectly normal in Korea for any guy to wear makeup, not only idols. Also, I want to point out that literally all actors or singers wear some kind of makeup, whether it's just a little bit of powder to hide the shine on their face or a full face of makeup. They look feminine/gay. Maybe by western standards they do. But in Korean, they are actually considered very masculine. There are many more but I think these are the top ones. ",
