            "answer_text": "There are a couple of things in this question that should be clarified. First, the decision to upload music to Spotify is not made by the artist unless the artist owns the master recording. The master owners of the most popular records are usually labels. Although a great many of the tracks currently available on Spotify (and other platforms like Apple Music and Amazon Prime) might be owned by the artists themselves, the tracks that are streamed the most belong to labels. Whether they were signed to a label of a producer, most recording artists in the 20th Century were paid a royalty. The older the contract, the lower that royalty rate tended to be. Back in the 60\u2019s the royalty rate (after the producer\u2019s cut) was often less than 10%. Over the decades the rates rose, so by the 90\u2019s the rate might exceed 20% (with the producer royalty normally being paid by the artist). Today it\u2019s common to see the artist receive half of all the net revenue that a recording earns. However no money is earned until all costs are recovered, including recording costs. All this is to explain that if an artist is only paid a royalty rate on streams, that\u2019s not going to be a lot of money. If the artist gets half the streaming revenue, that\u2019s not so bad. And the if the artist owns the master (implying that he or she actually financed the recording) a lot of money can be made. Spotify pays on the basis that iTunes established with downloads. That means as a distributor, they generally retain about 30% of the money earned for providing their service. The remaining money is paid 12% to the song-writers (although that percentage is certain to rise in the future) and and 88% goes to the owner of the master recording. There is no set amount since the free tier (supported by advertising) pays far less than the premium tier which is paid by subscribers. Mind you, the great majority (85%+) of Spotify users pay the monthly fee. So I\u2019m generalizing with this example but I\u2019m \u201cin the ball-park\u201d when I say that a million streams on Spotify might generate $840 for the song-writers/publishers and $6160 for the master owner. Assuming the artist doesn\u2019t owe the label any money for recording (and other costs), an artist from the 70\u2019s might earn a little over $700 from a million streams. An artist in a more modern deal would make over $3000 per million and an artist who owns the master makes $6000+. (All amounts are in USD). This explains why the four major record companies (who own most of the successful catalog and often on very favorable terms) are making historic profits from streaming. It explains why Heritage Artist from the 70\u2019s feel they are getting a terrible deal. It also explains how a new generation of artist-entrepreneurs are getting rich. Provided you own masters that are streaming in the most lucrative markets (U.S.A. and Europe/UK) Spotify is the best thing that ever happened. But it also requires working those markets and unless you have hit singles that means touring. (A lot!) It isn\u2019t easy, but I work with a number of artists who have proven that it isn\u2019t impossible either. One thing is certain; the days when people bought music are gone. There will always be \u201ccollectors\u201d (of vinyl and even CD\u2019s), but the biggest record companies in the world are very happy with the new streaming model. Don\u2019t expect that business model to change any time soon. ",

            "answer_text": "100% of 0 is still 0. It\u2019s better to get paid something than to not get anything at all. Also that Spotify pays little is more of a myth than reality. You get more casual listeners than would ever buy your album so it\u2019s not possible to compare the two. As an indie artist Spotify is very convenient. You just have to put up your release and let the money tick in. You don\u2019t have to spend money on printing covers, burning CDs, mailing et.c. Spotify will even do some of your marketing for you. Spotify will put your tracks in their radio and curated playlists. ",
