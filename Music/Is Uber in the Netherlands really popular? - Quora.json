But I have driven people from other European countries that were in my town on vacation and from what I understand, Uber in Europe is growing exponentially. But, there was also a lot of bad press about Uber \u201cpaying off\u201d police and city officials in various countries to not prosecute various criminal offenses committed by Uber drivers. Now that I find appalling and disgusting and as I learn more about Uber on a daily basis I'm finding myself becoming extremely withdrawn by the \u201cpartnership\u201d I have with them\u2026another total joke. I do it because I really like all the people I've been meeting and would otherwise never have a chance to meet. But, I\u2019ve digressed, sorry about that. ",

            "answer_text": "I always used Uber (now Grab) in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore). However, in the Netherlands I never use Uber. I dont use Uber because I use my own local public transportion. Uber is available in major cities such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. But outsides these cities there are less or no Uber available. I know that Uber is used by many tourists in Amsterdam. Schiphol airport also has a specially designated parking lot for Ubers. Taxis are expensive in the Netherlands and an Uber is 35% cheaper. If I were a tourist in Amsterdam and public transportion is not an option, I would certainly use an Uber.  And Uber's international headquarters with 1000 employees is also located in Amsterdam.  ",
