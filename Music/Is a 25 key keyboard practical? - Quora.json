            "answer_text": "A 25-key keyboard can be done. It's pretty much what many pre-smartphones were doing. However, that doesn't mean it's practical -- it's a pain in the ass.  That said, if someone introduced a 25-key supplemental keyboard, a simple 5x5 matrix of multi-programmable keys (so I can give it a switchable layout), gave it nice mechanical (like Cherry or Alps, not X-keys metal dome) switches, and priced it under about $50, I'd buy one in a heartbeat as the ultimate number/cursor pad and also for gaming. Aside from the price and the metal domes, the X-keys XK-24 is actually not too far off the mark, and actually I'd rather have 30 keys than 25:  Although I could make it work with 25 (but not without a Fn key):   ",
