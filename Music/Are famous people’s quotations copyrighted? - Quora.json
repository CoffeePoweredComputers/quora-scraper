            "answer_text": "Legally, anything you say is copyrighted as a creative work, unless\u2026 The unless part is complex. In general, it means that the thing you said isn\u2019t creative or way too common. There\u2019s also the problem of \u201cprior art\u201d as someone else could have said the same thing before. For example, answering questions is not creative. It\u2019s just an answer so it isn\u2019t copyrighted. General speech is also hard to get copyrighted as you need to show that is was meant to create something artistic, which is generally hard to do. But people talking in a TV show can be copyrighted, even if the dialog is non-scripted. That\u2019s because making a TV show is a creative process and the makers of the show have copyright on the images and basically whatever is said in the show. But then we have \u201cfair use\u201d which would allow parts of the complete dialog to be quoted in reference to the person who said it or the show from where it was taken. Finally, there\u2019s also the point that people don\u2019t even care about the copyrights they have over what they said. In which case it is still copyrighted but no one is stopping any of the violations. To make it even more complex, speeches given by the Federal Government are immediately part of the Public Domain. So if the POTUS tells a children story that he himself created and tells this to a bunch of kids on a school, with a camera filming it all then the story becomes public domain! But the recording of this story-telling can be copyrighted\u2026 State Governments, on the other hand, can decide to retain copyright over their own speeches, though. Thus if a speech is made by a State Official, it might be copyrighted. (Still, you have fair use!) Then there\u2019s this question: Could Michelle Obama Sue Melania Trump Over Plagiarized Speech? The answer to that is \u201cmaybe\u201d but the story also tells another part of the whole copyright discussion! You have to show that the copyright violation actually caused you (financial) damages and that\u2019s nearly impossible with any speech. You spoke it and everyone heard it. So, how are you losing profits when everyone repeats what you said? So, practically speeches aren\u2019t copyrighted, even if they legally are\u2026 You\u2019re moving into a possible minefield if you start quoting famous people, though. They might try to get some financial compensation for it, as you\u2019re making profit from their quotes and they don\u2019t get a share\u2026 That\u2019s financial damage\u2026 If it will hold in court? Doubtful, but the legal costs for you might be high enough to go bankrupt if you don\u2019t settle it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two things that govern this: Is something that someone said in passing a \u201cwork of art\u201d; andIf it is, when was it said?Something that somebody says in itself, as far as I know, is not a work of art. If it was something said by someone who made the comment less than 70 years ago, and then included that comment in, for example, a book, or inscribed upon a painting or sculpture, or even (as I have seen) a drip mat in a bar, which themselves are works of art, then those works of art, by dint of the fact that they ARE works of art, are governed by copyright laws. Similarly if it comes from a speech which is then published in a book, then the book is governed by copyright law. But to the best of my knowledge and belief what someone says cannot in itself be copyrighted. (I\u2019m sure Marvin Gaye\u2019s estate would disagree). My two favourite quotations, which I have no fear of repeating here are: \u201cTake the first step in faith. You do not have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step.\u201d - Martin Luther King; and\u201cThe human body may remain naked and unclothed and retain its beauty and its splendour.\u201d - Karol Wojtyla \u2026 whom you probably know better as Pope John Paul II.",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the Ask. I am not a lawyer. US Copyright laws, and the international Berne Convention, stipulate that the creative expression must be fixed in form (written down, recorded, something). If there is a record of someone saying something, that counts (probably). It is difficult, however, to determine who might hold those copyrights, and if/when they expire. Generally, most stuff goes public 25\u2013120 years from creation, depending on format, region, and when the creator died. The great things about quotes, though, is that they can be used/presented as \u201cfair use\u201d as educational or parody or transformative work, and they\u2019re easy to cite. If you want to plaster a famous quote on something, all you have to do is say \u201cthis person said this\u201d and you\u2019re clear. It does get thorny if you want to attribute a quote from fiction, because that can step on copyright licenses that are more exact and specific\u2026 and it could be argued that you\u2019re reproducing (infringing) someone else\u2019s property. Feel free to quote J.K. Rowling\u2019s political statements on a T-shirt, but don\u2019t transcribe any Harry Potter dialogue. A good rule of thumb: If the original copyright owner is making money by using this quote (like all the official Harry Potter merch out there), then you should not try to rip it off. If you share some examples, we can give you better answers. As always, if you have money riding on this, it is worth hiring a lawyer. Good luck! ",

Artist Emily McDowell wrote a great intro article on this topic: Using Famous Quotes On Products: When Is It OK?. I know it\u2019s a bummer that modern quotes can\u2019t be used on commercial work without permission, but it\u2019s good that you asked! It\u2019s definitely the professional and respectful thing to do. On a side note, it might not hurt to create designs with any quote you like for the sole purpose of sharing via social media and growing your audience (with proper credits to the author, of course)\u2026 That way if the quote passes into the public domain while you\u2019re still selling products, you might be able to use it for profit at that point.
