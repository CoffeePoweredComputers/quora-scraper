            "answer_text": "Yes, Nicki Minaj deserves that! Her lyrics, beats, quality, and personality is on fleek. Unlike Iggy her lyrics aren't always very understandable when she is on live and Nicki Minaj's always are. Lil Kim shouldn't get this because her beats and lyrics and not on flow. Other female rapper are cool, but they can't be compared to Nicki Minaj!!    Love You Nicki Minaj! ",
