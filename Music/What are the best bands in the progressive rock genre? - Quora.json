            "answer_text": "I'm gonna recommend 30 albums by 30 different acts.I like many albums by these acts so I've chosen the ones that are good introduction's. Here goes\u2026.. 1.Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon is probably the best known prog album of all time.  2.Genesis selling England by the pound is one of many classic album's by this great band, my favorite Peter Gabriel era album by them.  3. In the court of the crimson King by King crimson is a seminal release by the first line up of king Crimson.  4. Brain salad surgery by supergroup Emerson, Lake and Palmer is another classic.  5. Yes close to the edge is my favorite album by the band, this album has the classic line up  6. Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells is another classic album,this album launched Virgin records and was used as the soundtrack to the horror classic The Exorcist.  7. Queens a night at the opera showcases Queen at their prog best  8. Peter Hammil Nadirs big chance is a classic album that even has punky moments on it like the title track. Peter Hammil is also the driving force in classic prog act Van der Graff generator.  9. Hawkwind space ritual is a space rock opera . recorded live. It is awesome.  10. Gentle Giant octopus is a great album by the under achieving Gentle Giant who for years were one of prog rocks best kept secrets, though they do seem to be getting more attention these days which is great.  11.The Moody blues a question of balance is a classic album by one of progs biggest bands  12.David Bowie dipped his toes into prog rock now and again, none more so than the mad station to station album recorded under the influence of loads of drugs.  13. Caravans in the land of pink and grey is a perrenial prog classic, that has never been out of print. They are from the Canterbury scene, that gave us soft Machine and Hatfield and the north amongst other bands. This is my personal favorite of that scene.  14. Moonmadness by camel is my favorite album by them.  15. Jeff Wayne's war of the worlds is a double album epic based on HG wells classic tale of alien invasion. It has an all-star cast including Richard Burton and Justin Hayward of the moody blues.  16.Jethro Tull Aqualung is a classic album in the prog genre.  17. Marillion Misplaced Childhood is a classic neo prog album. Neo prog was the second wave of prog bands that came out in the 1980 s and marillion and this album are the most successful from that movement.  18.Eye in the sky by The Alan Parsons project is my favorite album by producer/engineer Alan Parsons and collected musicians and singers.  19. The raven that refused to sing by Stephen Wilson is my favorite prog album of the 21st century so far.  20. Iron maiden seventh son of a seventh son. Metal goes prog all of Iron Maidens prog influences are laid bare on this occult classic. Queensryches operation mindcrime came out that year too which is also a prog metal classic.  21.Focus making waves is a classic album from Dutch Band Focus.Hocus Pocus the song is eccentric and brilliant, just like the rest of this album.  22.Pallas the sentinel is another album from the neo prog scene. Pallas are a Scottish band and this is a concept album,it was produced by Eddie Offord who produced classic Yes albums.  23.Liege and Lief by Fairport Convention is a classic album, where folk and progressive music meet and mix wonderfully.  24.Gong Angels egg, part of the Radio Gnome Trilogy, this is an eccentric, spaced out Classic.  25.Magma MDK, is as far out as prog gets, influenced by classical music and opera, they even invented their own language to perform it in.  26.Kate Bush the hounds of love is a classic album by the first lady of prog rock, packed with hits this is prog pop at its best.  27. Can Tago Mago, named after an island Alistair Crowley visited, may be the pinnacle of Krautrock, which is German Prog.  28.Bob Calvert captain Lockheed and the starfighters, is a comedy concept album about a failed German air force program. Bob Calvert was sometime singer of Hawkwind, the album also has the brilliant Vivian Stanshall from Bonzo dog dooh dah band and tubular bell at his eccentric best.  29. Renaissance Schezerade and other stories, is a classic album, influenced by classical music  30.last but not least. Kraftwerk Autobahn.Kraftwerk would become the most important band in electronic music, but their roots were in prog rock and you can hear it here.  \u2026. I could pick another 30albums by 30 other bands easily, but these bands and artists and these albums will give anyone a good basic understanding of what prog rock is. ",

            "answer_text": "My favourites. Obviously just my opinion. That's all this question can be answered with. 1. GENESIS. I can't recommend Genesis enough. I love almost every song they made from 1970-1980. My favourite album is And Then There Were Three (1978). Be careful which versions of their albums you get, because they all were sacrilegiously remixed in 2007 and falsely marketed as simply \"remastered\". The 1994 Definitive Edition Remasters sound beautiful, where as the remixes sound like they are falling apart. 2. FRANK ZAPPA/THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION. His discography is a confusing mess when it comes to remixes and reissues of original mixes. In some cases I actually prefer FZ's remixes, but not all. Listen to what ever version you like. Some albums I recommend are Studio Tan (1978, 1995 Rykodisc Remix) and One Size Fits All (1975, I don't think it was ever remixed). There's A LOT more, but those are good places to start. 3. RICK WAKEMAN. Yes (band) is good, but the solo work of this former Yes keyboardist is even better. Check out Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1974), King Arthur (1975) and No Earthly Connection (1976). 4. BLACK SABBATH. Maybe not as classically influenced as typical prog rock, but with such adventurous, fun and beautiful music they are no mere heavy metal band as they are often accused of being. Ozzy Osbourne is the master of melody. People rave about the first 3 albums and while those are great, I'm more into the later 5 of the first 8 albums. Some good places to start are Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath (1973, Rick Wakeman plays on this album!) or, you know what, just go ahead and listen to all the first 8 albums. Frank Zappa was a fan. 5. JETHRO TULL. I highly recommend the album Thick as a Brick (1972). Also, A Passion Play (1973) took me a few listens to appreciate, but now I love it. 6. CAMEL. A good place to start is Moonmadness (1976). 7. STEVE HACKETT. Best Genesis solo artist. Voyage of the Acolyte (1975) and Spectral Mornings (1979). 9. STARCASTLE. They are often accused of being a Yes clone, but if you listen to them enough you'll notice they have their own ideosyncracies. Perhaps the most jolly of prog bands. Starcastle (1976) and Fountains of Light (1977). 10. KANSAS. Leftoverture (1976). 11. MORGAN. Criminally overlooked band that featured vocalist Tim Staffell, who was in the band Smile, which was Queen before Freddy Mercury. Their only 2 albums are both masterpieces. Nova Solis (1972) and The Sleeper Wakes (1973). 12. YES. Time and a Word (1970), Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) and Relayer (1974). 13. EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER. A good place to start is Tarkus (1971). 14. GENTLE GIANT. I want to like this band more than I do because they have so many great moments, but I find most of their albums to be spotty. They make the good parts short and the not-so-good parts long. Still, I have a lot of respect for them as musicians and at least Acquiring the Taste (1971) is a mostly consistently good album. The Power and the Glory (1974) is good too. 15. BABYLON. A great Genesis-inspired band that put out only 1 album, Babylon (1978). 16. THE ENID. This is about as symphonic as a band can get without being an actual orchestra. The first 2 albums were remixed and I like those versions and the original mixes. I think the 3rd and 4th albums are a little better. Touch Me (1979) and Six Pieces (1980). 17. TRILOGY. Genesis meets ELP instrumental band that put out one album with less-than-professional production, but the music is great. Here it Is (1979). 18. JEAN JACQUES PERREY. I guess one would call this early synth pop with classical influences, so maybe not standard prog rock, but it certainly appeals to this classic prog fan. The Amazing New Electronic Sound (1968) and Moog Indigo (1970). 19. RETURN TO FOREVER. These guys come from the jazz world, but man they bring the symphonic synthesizer madness on the album Romantic Warrior (1976). 20. WEATHER REPORT. And let's round off this list with the best of jazz fusion, that close cousin of prog. Heavy Weather (1977) and Black Market (1976). There's more good stuff, but I've rambled enough. ",
