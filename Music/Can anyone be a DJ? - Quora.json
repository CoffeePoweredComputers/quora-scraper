            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of a DJ. If it simply means a person who plays music for others, sure (no mixing involved). Anyone with a pulse and mp3s can do it. If you\u2019re asking about being a real, professional working DJ, then the answer is definitely a resounding NO. Here\u2019s why: A real working DJ takes time to master their mixing craft (like years), music selection, reading the crowd, keeping up with new music, practices, also does branding and promotions, and basically works very hard for peanuts- especially in the beginning of their DJ career. After years of struggles and lots of practice, a DJ can get better, and also get better gigs once their reputation is built. Even then, you deal with shady promoters, hate from fellow DJs trying to bring you down (because of insecurity about their own ability), and a myriad of other difficulties. It is not easy\u2026 Hopefully IF you built a good rep, you will start getting lots of repeat business over time, and possibly DJ full-time for higher pay (weddings, parties, corporate gigs, clubs, etc. etc.).

            "answer_text": "Sure. Just Bluetooth your phone to a boom box at a party & press play on your Spotify playlist and voila! You're a DJ. Now whether that makes you a good DJ, that people want to listen to or have at their party or not, is something else entirely. The proliferation of DJ apps over the past 15 or so years has really changed the industry dramatically. Whilst they've lowered the barriers to entry, the apps have convinced a lot of people that it's easier than it actually is. Many of the challenging aspects have been automated with algorithms - particularly in respect to beatmixing & transitions. Everything's seamless & perfect. Zero skill needed - simply let the app do everything for you and sound like a star. Kinda sounds appealing, doesn't it? Minimal effort with maximal results. You can almost hear the crowds chanting your name at festivals. Jet setting celebrity. All from an app. Except it doesn't work that way. At all. Technology can't replace talent. Now don't get me wrong. DJs only exist because of technology. After all, DJs were born from a tech revolution. Radio jocks resulted from the birth of the medium. And things pretty much stayed that way for decades, with DJs never rising much past being a voice tha accompanied your favourite tunes, filling the gaps between them. It was about personality, more than anything else. And then the revolution happened. A little hi fi company called Technics, released a turntable with radical features like direct drive and variable pitch control. DJing as we know it today, owes everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, to the 1200. Pioneers in Detroit, Chicago, New York & elsewhere realized how powerful a tool it was. Beatmixing was born, sounds were bent, remixing & sampling could be done live in the club. The DJ as a performer in his own right was now a reality. Then came hip hop & rap, where the DJ took the place of the traditional band, creating a sonic backdrop for the MCs to spit bars over. Technology, once again revolutionized things with the CD. It took a bit for the hardware to evolve to the point where a DJ could perform somewhat the same as he would on vinyl. The release of the Pioneer CDJ-1000, followed by mp3s, laptops & interfaces, coded vinyl & CDs, really allowed DJs to become superstar performers - headliners, in their own right. Something to aspire to. Now, the reason I've gone through this very condensed, abridged history of DJing is to point something out. Until the advent of these new DJ apps which automate everything, in order to be a DJ, you had to be able to mix, among other things. There was skill involved. Talent was needed. Pressing play didn't make you a DJ, flow did (among other things). The good news is that the skills required to DJ can be learned. From simple beatmixing through more complex transitions to flow & vibe and even more abstract aspects like ear (not your biological hearing apparatus but rather the intangible quality of critical listening), everything can be learned & developed. Then there's the type of gig, which also affects things. For example, weddings & parties are vastly different than pubs & clubs, which are again different from concerts or festivals. Weddings & parties focus less on beatmixing & more on overall flow. The DJ is there to augment the event rather than be the focus. A deep library and knowledge of music is more important because of the diversity of the crowd. The deeper your musical knowledge here, the easier it is to keep the flow going. Crash fading Garth Brooks into Slipknot into Frankie Goes to Hollywood into Frank Sinatra results in a shit gig. You can begin to specialize a bit spinning in pubs, which are kind of halfway between parties & clubs. At a club, the DJ is the entertainment, so here is where you get to specialize your format and show off your skills. Here, as well as pubs, your flow is as important as your mixing. The top club DJs understand how to keep the crowd rotating with the flow. They cycle the crowd from dancefloor to bar to seating/sidelines and back to the floor. Concerts are where you get to shine, whether you're opening or headlining. This is where you get to show off what you do. All your tricks, your sound, your vibe. This is typically what people think of when they think of DJs. Here it's all about the dancefloor. Behind the decks, it's all yours and you are god. Beatmixing, transitions, sonic tricks, etc, all come to the forefront. Your style & flow is what people are here for. Of course, you may be wondering why I'm mentioning this breakdown. Simple. The skills you need to be a successful DJ vary depending on where you are. Again, these skills can all be learned, though some are more difficult to master than others. To wrap it all up, it is absolutely possible to teach anyone to be a legit DJ. The concepts involved are, for the most part, straightforward. Making a living at it, on the other hand, not so much. Especially if your goal is to be a world famous headliner. Anyway, I've rambled on long enough, cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "Well..: okay, let\u2019s go through this. If one is both deaf and blind, then they may have a difficult time of it though technically they could do it (not very well, but it\u2019s possible). If a person is deaf and blind and is missing both their hands and feet, then it would be perhaps possible to hit the play and cue buttons with one\u2019s nose ..: so again difficult but possible. If one were completely paralyzed, deaf, blind, and were missing both their arms and feet, then it would be very very difficult\u2026 i would say next to impossible without extra assistance. However, djs get assistants all of the time to do things like carry records or maybe even throw on a song while the DJ uses the restroom. I remember that once Madonna \u201cDJed\u201d but she really just sort of stood there wearing headphone while her assistant did all of the work selecting, cueing, and playing songs. In this theoretical case, a very very strong \u201cDJ assistant\u201d could hypothetically lift up the paralyzed, deaf, mute, no arm or leg having DJ and use the djs nose to push the buttons and trigger different effects. So there you have it. Anybody can be a DJ! Thanks, great question! ",

My two children who are 8 and 9 can play music they like and perform tremendous feats of finger dexterity. But are they DJ\u2019s? No they aren\u2019t. The fact they can perform a mix on equipment that does everything for them doesn\u2019t make them dj\u2019s. To become a \u201cgood\u201d Dj takes time, practice, endless hours of learning from your performance, being able to play to a dance floor of people and hold them there over the course of an evening, which in itself can\u2019t be done by just anyone. In summary, can anyone be a Dj? Yes. Can anyone be a good Dj? No because the learning curve knocks out the people not committed to learning the trade. ",

Now people think that producing a few shitty progressive house tracks and playing them through a Numark Party Mix to their light - up Bluetooth speaker makes them a DJ.
