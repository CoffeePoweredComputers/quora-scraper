            "answer_text": "Historically, areas of the world have followed certain schools of lutherie that manifests as a certain style of instrument. With globalization taking place for the past few centuries, however, we are seeing less of a distinct geographic border as to origins of the instrument's aesthetic qualitites. Personally, I see the question as being flawed. Asking \"which country makes the best violins\" is like asking \"what race of people are best at cooking?\" It's a question that reeks of ignorance, as if geographic location or cultural heritage, in the modern world, will have any direct impact on a person's ability to do their job. There are good and bad luthiers in all parts of the world, regardless of skin color or location. The stereotype dictates that violins of poor quality come from China, simply because many areas of Northern China have wrested the majority of control over the factory fiddle trade. A violin that comes out of a factory with little quality control will undoubtedly be of inferior quality to an individually-crafted instrument that emerges from a well-educated and practiced workshop (of which Mainland China has many). Conversely, the stereotype also insists that Italians make the best instruments. While we must recognize Italy as the epicenter for the accelerated evolution of the viol family into what we understand today as the orchestral string family, the story of the violin is multicultural at heart. It was the Ravanastron which many people consider to have introduced bowed strings into musical instruments, though this has been contested as having been truly a product of Central Asia and spread to the Eastern countries through nomadic peoples. Either way, the groundwork for the instrument was not solely a product of Western European heritage. Today, Italy produces little of the quality instruments it did during its heyday. Just as in many parts of the world, a great deal of poorly educated luthiers resting on a cloud of romantic, pie-in-the-sky history and \"tradition\" pollute the market with abysmal instruments that are only salvageable when taken to a knowledgeable luthier for regraduation and complete set-up. Currently, there is no quantifiable characteristic that allows us to determine where the best instruments come from (much less one that allows us to incontrovertibly determine the quality of a violin without subjective measurement). There are only the opinions of all those involved with the instrument, which will be fiercely argued back and forth until doomsday. I am of the opinion that the potential of an instrument can only be predicted by intimately knowing the hands and mind which made it; the color and location of those hands is irrelevant. ",

            "answer_text": "Countries don\u2019t make violins - people do. Italy, home of the most famous and sought-after instruments in history, would have to get a National Award if there were such a thing. One of the main luthier schools, which trains luthiers from all over the world, is still there in Cremona. ) Germany and France also have long histories and well-established traditions of luthierie, France taking the cake as the home of the finest bows. Tourte bows are on a par with Strads in the impossibly-priced and sought-after category these days. We have a very good school in Utah here in the USA, and many fine makers. Eastern Europe -particularly Poland, Romania, Hungary and Czechoslovakia (or whatever it\u2019s called now) all boast good makers. There\u2019s a guy in Australia making incredible violins - Isaac Stern bought several for his personal collection. China is mostly mass-produced student grade stuff now, but they are moving upward quickly. They are a quick study, those Chinese ;-) ",
