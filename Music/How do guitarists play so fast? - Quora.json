            "answer_text": "Loads of these answers say things like \u201cpractice!\u201d (practice what?) and there\u2019s \u201cno magic trick\u201d (yes, there is). Here are a few tips: Hammer on:. Fret a string at say the 5th fret. Deson\u2019t matter which string, but usually it\u2019s easier on the thinner strings (at first). Use your forefinger on the string. Pluck the string with strumming hand. Now while it\u2019s ringing (ie quickly), put (for example) your 3rd finger on the string somewhere nearer the bridge than your original finger (Let\u2019s say two frets up in pitch). BUT still hold both fingers down on the string. Because the string was still ringing, you use its energy to play the second note without having to pluck the string again.Hammer off: From that position, release your 3rd finger and drag it slightly across the string as you do so. You\u2019ll feel the string twang slightly again as it\u2019s released, and your original note played by your forefinger (still on the string) will ring. If you can get this happening quickly, it\u2019s a pretty easy way of playing incredibly fast solos without having to synchronise your strumming hand with your fret playing hand. Google \u201cguitar hammer on - off\u201d or something similar, I bet youtube has loads of videos. note that hammer on / off is generally easier and sounds better on an electric guitar, with either some distortion or compression to help smooth out the notes.Tapping: Very similar to hammer on / off, the only difference being you use your strumming (usually right) hand fingers to do the hammer on/off, which means the second fret you use can be a long interval away from the first- wherever you like, in fact. Eddie Van Halen made this technique famous, to great effect. The speed feels almost unlimited once you get comfortable with it.Sweeping: I\u2019ve never got into this, but google \u201cguitar sweeping\u201d to see how it\u2019s done - basically you play across the fret quickly, so the speed comes from playing adjacent strings quickly. I shan\u2019t say much more as I\u2019m not very good at it !Shredding: This is the trickiest, and I have never mastered it. Actually I\u2019ve never needed to, because I\u2019m pretty good at hammer on/off and tapping. Basically this involves playing notes very fast with your fret hand, and plucking the strings in time with your right hand: ire simply playing very quickly. With this one, there really isn\u2019t a magic trick: just practice.Almost all guitarists I\u2019ve heard use hammer on / hammer off and many now use tapping. ",

            "answer_text": "As the other answers say - it\u2019s practice. However, some people can play much quicker than others and that\u2019s down to hand size, finger strength and other personal factors which would influence speed. Much like an athlete - everyone is different. That\u2019s down to genetics. Also, the guitar setup plays a part in speed. Low actions are easier to shred on. Lower gauge strings also play a part though these do tend to have a harsher more trebly sound. The problem with playing fast is the synchronisation if the picking hand with the fretting hand. Usually, the fretting hand can move a lot faster than the picking hand - this is simple mechanics. The picking hand has to do a lot more work to keep up. Various styles of picking are used, but the alternate picking is considered the fastest. But the fact remains that the fretting hand will always be much faster than the picking hand. Additionally, guitarists can cheat - they use technics such as legato, pulling the strings down and releasing with each finger to produce a clean fast run, and sweeping, brushing the pick up and down a chord so each note sounds individually. Finger tapping is also a way to get fast runs. Having said that - nothing is as fast as a fast alternate picking technique. It can sound like a buzz saw. Generally, most people who take up the guitar will want to play impressive pieces. Speed is considered impressive but without the musicality to make it interesting it wears very thin very quickly. The current world record for speed is triplets at 1250bpm. It\u2019s ridiculous. However, none of the professional speed shredders have taken that test, so its unlikely it\u2019s the fastest out there. If you think guitarists are fast, check out violinists. They are much quicker as they don\u2019t have to worry about both hands sychronising perfectly all the time. Happy shredding. \ud83c\udfb8 ",
