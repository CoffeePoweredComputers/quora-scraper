            "answer_text": "Let me turn the question around a little: Why do Automotive mechanics have so many wrenches? Why do woodworkers have so many cutting, shaving, and shaping tools? Why does my seamstress wife have 5 sewing machines: big monster of a fast, powerful straight stitcher; \u201ccomputer-controlled\u201d machine that does complex stitches and excels at buttonholes; 4-thread serger, 3-thread serger/hemmer; and industrial blind-hemmer? I think you might see the point I am making. From purely a practical point of view, each guitar brings something different to the music. I have 4 regularly used electric guitars. Each sounds\u2014and plays\u2014quite differently. I use the Tele for crisp, sharp, treble rhythm playing and switch to the overwound P90 neck pickup pushing an amp on the edge of breakup for blues.my Les Paul is my most \u201cchameleon-like\u201d electric, outfitted with pickups I custom built for it. It can do clean, dirty, gritty, warm, bright, and lots of sounds in between (but it\u2019s still sometimes missing something).I have an old ES-335 style guitar built in Japan in the 1970s that perfectly produces the sound of most early to mid 1960s Rock, plus can play a wonderful and mellow jazzy tone. The Bigsby (knock-off) vibrato is a very nice addition to its palette and list of capabilities.then there\u2019s the Roland GR chimera of a guitar. It\u2019s a straight up 1980s \u201cHair Band in Stadium\u201d designed guitar with a weird & wacky, \u201cit came from outer space\u201d look, hot pickups, and a dive-bombing vibrato system. It also happens to be a synthesizer controller for a Roland GR700, so I can pull out sounds of guitar, synth, and any blend between the two I can imagine (at least imagine for an early 80\u2019s vintage digital/analog synthesizer). In spite of any similarities in pickup design, I CANNOT produce Les Paul sounds with it. It has no Telecaster tonal qualities. It cannot do the \u201cmellow\u201d nor the \u201cjangle\u201d of the 335 copy.That\u2019s just me with 4 electric guitars. I \u201cneed\u201d at least one more. Not one of my current guitars can adequately reproduce the sound of a Stratocaster with the selector switch set in the 2nd position; that\u2019s the bridge & middle pickups generating that nasal mid-rangey Strat \u201cquack.\u201d This is my favorite Strat sound (followed by switch position 4 with neck + middle) and I cannot achieve it with any of my current instruments. I could repeat this exercise with my 4 main acoustic guitars\u2014where the sonic differences between them and the way each instrument lays in one\u2019s hands are even more dramatically different, but I think you might get the idea. \u2026and that is just considering sound and feel. Along with that we must then add the other esthetic considerations; things like we humans\u2019 propensity to place value on things like color, decoration, and novelty\u2026and Our predilection to collect and even hoard things.

            "answer_text": "Guitars look cool. Matching the guitar to a particular song adds to performance ambiance. That, however, is not the only reason. Guitars can be made to sound different even if they look the same. What is a guitar to a musician? To the untrained eye, all guitars look similar unless they are something special like a BC Rich. An acoustic guitar can sound different based on the wood materials and string materials. It is a platform to capture the tone of resonating strings. There are remarkably many variables you can change on an acoustic guitar to make it sound different, and many musicians own more than one but rarely a huge number of them, but here I focus on electric guitars as those tend to be the ones that become huge collections. An acoustic electric guitar can be thought of as a subset of electric guitars with limited pickup choices. Electric guitar is a platform for mounting electronics to capture the tone of resonating strings. It consists of a body, bridge, saddles, optionally tremolo, one or more pickups, switches, electronics, neck, fretboard, nut, 6 or more strings (except for the 4-string tenor guitars), and the tuners. It can have both active and passive electronics. I am not mentioning the signal path after the cable exits the guitar body. It also can be tuned in standard tuning, drop D tuning, and any number of other tunings. All of these variables affect the sound. All of them have many options. Each of those elements can be customized. Let\u2019s say you want to play a song using the whammy bar. You will want a locking tremolo system if you want the guitar to stay in tune. Let\u2019s say you want to play some heavy metal. You would want humbucker pickups rather than single coil pickups. If you are playing blues, you will probably want single coils. The classic Stratocaster is an S-S-S pickup configuration. An H-S-S guitar is a good compromise of both, but then you will not get the single coil pickup sound in bridge position. Musicians can conceivably buy a single guitar like Somnium Guitars with interchangeable pickups or American Acoustasonic\u00ae Series Guitars with built-in modeling, but these are a relatively recent invention and VERY expensive costing over $2000. I am aware that these guitars are not the first in history, but interchangeable pickup guitars are rare anyway. Interchangeable pickup guitars are fantastic for testing pickups while shopping for pickups. However, you can\u2019t afford glitches during a live performance. At the end of a song, the guitar will often go slightly out of tune. Switching to a second guitar freshly tuned by your tech assures you stay in tune, so now you need a minimum of two guitars for a live show. A far more reliable way is to setup multiple guitars to match the configuration necessary to best perform a particular song. You can buy 10 $200 guitars for the price of one interchangeable pickup guitar. With relatively little finishing work, they can perform similar to much pricier counterparts. The fit and finish of better inexpensive instruments is astonishing these days. So, in addition to merely adding a cool-looking instrument to the collection, the musician often sets them up differently to produce different sounds from different components. ",
