            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say Plant actually disliked him; I just think it was more a matter of them simply not being very close. In fact, none of the other 3 were particularly tight with Jonesy. Plant, Page, and Bonham were all 100% signed up to the rock and roll lifestyle, and fully embraced everything that went with it - the partying, the sleeping in, the drugs, the women\u2026 and Jones certainly didn\u2019t fully reject these extravagances, but his heart was never really in it. The other three were full-fledged, highly enthusiastic rock stars, but Jones never really wanted to be anything but a musician. While the other three were holed up in a hotel room shooting heroin all day, Jones would be wearing disguises and going around exploring whatever city they were in. He once said, \u201cI can\u2019t understand the point of traveling all around the world and never seeing anything but the inside of hotel rooms.\u201d Then he\u2019d get back to the hotel in time to change clothes and do a line of coke before the show, but to the other three, he was always something of an outsider. A brilliant and totally dedicated musician, but just\u2026 not a rock star. Jones was swept along by the tremendous early success of the band, because\u2026 who wouldn\u2019t be? But by the time the band was recording Houses of The Holy in 1973, he\u2019d had enough. He\u2019d made his money, and he\u2019d had his fun, but he wasn\u2019t really having much of it anymore. He had married in 1967, and was deeply devoted to his family, and began to resent the time away from them. The band talked him into staying, but the divide between him and the rest just continued to widen over the the remaining years. Then, in 1977, when Plant\u2019s 3-year old son Karok died, none of the other three attended the funeral. This was not something that Plant ever really felt OK with. It caused a strain between him and all three of the others, but considering he was never really close with Jonesy anyway, it was harder for him to make up with him than it was with the other three. Years later, time had healed most of the wounds, and Plant and Jones became warmer toward each other, but I don\u2019t think either of them ever missed the other. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Robert Plant and John Paul Jones simply had different attitudes about what Led Zeppelin meant to them. Robert Plant was a true believer, a free-love hippie who would have done the whole thing for free. John Paul Jones saw being a wildly popular musician as simply a lucrative career doing something that doesn\u2019t suck. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true that they didn\u2019t like each other. I\u2019d say they were occasionally at odds because they were different people. And since Robert grew up with Bonham and was a kindred to Jimmy, he was probably least-closest to Jonesy. But it\u2019s really hard to be in a band for 11 years with someone you don\u2019t like, even if you\u2019re making gobs of money. ",
