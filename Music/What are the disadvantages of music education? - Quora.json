            "answer_text": "I\u2019m interpreting the question a bit differently than everyone else, so apologies ahead of time if this is WAY OFF of your original question. But here goes\u2026 Instead of focusing on \u201cmusic education\u201d as a college discipline, I\u2019m going to talk about what I call formal musical training. That is, the act of learning or honing musical skill as an academic discipline. This involves the classroom-oriented approach to learning music\u2014learning to sight-read musical notation, studying chord progressions, understanding melody and harmony\u2014all the fun stuff. Formal training (classroom-style music education) certainly has advantages: Mainly, it allows musicians from all over the world to share ideas with each other through a common language. However, I\u2019ve seen it come with disadvantages as well. Commonly, the more \u201cclassically trained\u201d a player is, the harder it is for them to make music WITHOUT sheet music. Through intense study, players actually train themselves OUT of creativity, fluidity, adaptability, and the ability to learn by rote. Formal training also carries the disadvantage of dampening creativity. Through academic study, we are taught that music is built on a system of rules we must follow. These rules serve a great purpose, but lead to the homogenization of music. Non-classically-trained musicians have NO IDEA about these rules, and are thus not bound by them. TL DR version: Music education is great, but the classroom is only ONE facet of becoming a master of your craft. Placing too much emphasis on classroom-style music education can harm your musicianship just as much as it can help. ",

            "answer_text": "There are no disadvantages to Music Education. True, most students will not have a career in music, but the critical thinking skills, the concentration, the idea of working toward a group goal, increased abilities in math, discipline, and personal achievement are all by-products of a music education. There are tons of studies showing the advantages of having a music education. Students also learn how to deal with both success and disappointment. Besides those advantages, many people turn back to their instruments or voice as they join community bands, choruses, and orchestras as a social and mental activity. Older people can keep their mental abilities by playing a musical instrument. There is even a program \u201cNew Horizons) designed to get seniors back into playing an instrument. So, my answer to your question is that there is NO disadvantage to a music education. ",
