            "answer_text": "Martin Fox did a lot of the heavy lifting on this answer. A lot of those songs brought back fond memories. Anyhow, here is a scattering of postcards from my teens in the 90\u2019s in no order whatsoever. At the Drive In: 198d (1999) Why? Vaya, is easily one of the most critically overlooked albums of all time. If you listen to what Omar Rodriguez-Lopez is doing with his guitar, you\u2019ll appreciate what a gift this band really was.  Soul Coughing: Mr Bitterness (1994) A guy that worked at Strawberries music store told me that if I didn\u2019t like this album, Ruby Vroom, I could bring it back. I never brought it back. Why? Lyrics like these: leaning up against the wallI will lash out dancing like a madman when you're goneI will spit the blue flame and hurl my glass against the wall  G Love and the Special Sauce: Blues Music (1994) Why? This band put one of the most incredible shows I had ever seen\u2026 including 20 foot tall dancing puppets brought by a local art collective. Also, I\u2019m native to the Philly area. These guys are princes, and their sounds on record do not do them enough justice for how good they really are.  The Kostars: Don\u2019t Know Why (1995) If you like Lucious Jackson and Ween and find it hard to imagine a world in which they joined together for a song\u2026 this is the your song. This album, Classics With a K, is a top to bottom musical adventure. FANTASTIC memories here.  Eric\u2019s Trip: The Stove (1993) This particular song of of the album, Love Tara, brings me closest to actually feeling nostalgic and all gooey-huey misty eyed about it. Coffee never smelled as good to me as it did around this time. I don\u2019t know why.  Dismemberment Plan: Survey Says! (1995) This was a band that opened up for another band who I came to see. I forget who that band is now because I became a D-Plan fan that day, and that is all that matters. This was the song they opened up with. My ass is probably still somewhere on the wall of the Trocadero (yes, I mean they blew it off).  To be continued\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Alternative Rock was the eventual name given and accepted for the underground college music scene of the 1980's. Bands like R.E.M., The Cure, Jane's Addiction and Bauhaus, among others, were recording and touring incessantly in order to develop a following. They were releasing music on small, independent labels and getting airplay by college radio stations where a rabid following developed for a new music that was well outside the established mainstream. By the 1990's, the major labels recognized the marketability of these artists and started signing them to big label contracts that immediately brought the power of their promotional mechanisms to the genre. Bands were being sought and signed as fast as the major labels could acquire them. New music from NYC, LA, Boston, Chicago, and the up-and-coming Seattle scene were thought highly marketable and corporate radio stations were even reformatting their programming to showcase the new Alternative. It was a great time. So much new music hit the airwaves, and many of these bands have survived until today. Even among those that didn't make it, the influence of their perspective and style is felt now in the newest Pop and Alternative offerings. My playlist from the 90's has to include some of the most influential of the period and just one or two that are just guilty pleasures. Nirvana: \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d  Pearl Jam: \u201cJeremy\u201d  Alice In Chains: \u201cWould\u201d  Soundgarden: \u201cFell On Black Days\u201d  Bush: \u201cSwallowed\u201d  Smashing Pumpkins: \u201c1979\u2033  Fuel: \u201cBittersweet\u201d  Radiohead: \u201cCreep\u201d  Oasis: \u201cWonderwall\u201d  The Verve Pipe: \u201cThe Freshman\u201d  Oh, man, there's so many more I loved, but I hope this will suffice for now.
