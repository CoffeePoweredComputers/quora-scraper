            "answer_text": "Yes. There are a few elements to mastering. The one that everyone thinks of (even though they may not really understand it) is the one with the audio processing. Mastering engineer Ian Sheppard describes that element something like this: if mixing is bringing all the recorded tracks together to form a cohesive song, mastering is bringing the songs together to form a cohesive album. An album recorded as you describe will probably be fairly consistent from song to song, but there could be variations. At the same time, though, the mastering engineer provides a second set of ears. They are also working in a different listening environment. They may hear problems that weren\u2019t evident when the songs were mixed - or were even caused by a deficiency in the studio in which the album was mixed. A song mixed in a studio where the low-mids are hard to hear may have over-loud low-mids - which worked at the time, but won\u2019t translate elsewhere. But in addition to this, mastering includes putting the tracks in the right order, putting in cross-fades (that doesn\u2019t really work for an mp3 release), adding metadata, and producing the files for final delivery. Most of that stuff is fairly basic, but someone needs to do it, so the album has to be mastered by someone. My first two paragraphs are the reason why it should be someone who knows what they are doing. And why, ideally, it should not be the person who mixed it. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a big fan of a separate mastering phase. It\u2019s true that consistently recorded, well-mixed tracks by a single producer would, in theory, be enough to result in a balanced, consistent album and I\u2019m sure that it can work well. (It depends partly on the style of music. A four-piece rock band doing pretty much all live takes is probably fine \u2026 but the more complex the music, and the more complex the recording process, the less consistent the output will be.) Mastering just gives you the opportunity to revisit the tracks afresh, to hear in a different way, to approach the whole entity of the album in a new light. And there are all sorts of tiny tweaks a good mastering engineer can make - and may think of when the original musicians and producer think they have \u201cdone everything\u201d. There are just a few mastering engineers who seem capable of sprinkling a bit of magic dust over a mix. Mastering allows you also to check the fades, get all the spaces between the tracks just right, adjust EQ, iron out any rough spots. So. To me, sure, you may well get a really nice result in the circumstances you describe. But personally - I like to get someone else to hear my work and I will always leave a gap between finalising mixes and mastering the end product. ",
