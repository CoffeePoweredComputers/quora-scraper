            "answer_text": "I think some older version of Javanese. The core of the Majapahit capital was centred around Mojokerto and Mojosari if I understand it right. After the fall to the Sultanate, the elite migrated to Bali and possibly the hills of Java among the Tenger. So Balinese would have been adopted after the migration. By that time there was no Majapahit kingdom anymore. This is what I understand. ",
