            "answer_text": "SHORT VERSION: First Part: Are Blackpink overrated? No, Blackpink is not overrated, they are overhyped. (By the way, I'm a Grammar Nazi and can't help but point out that the question should be Is Blackpink overrated? ) Second Part: Are they on the same level as other groups? If you're talking about skills and visuals, yes. Third Part: Did they get more fame than they deserve? Who are we to decide what they deserve and what they don't? DETAILED ANSWER: Overrated: \u201cIf something or someone is overrated, that person or thing is considered to be better or more important than they really are.\u201d Overhype: \u201cMake exaggerated claims about (a product, idea, or event); publicize or promote excessively.\u201d They are pretty similar words, so it's often difficult to determine whether something is overrated or overhyped. In Blackpink's case, it is clear that they are NOT overrated, but overhyped instead. They are considered as one of the top idol groups in K-pop, which they are. They only problem is that they haven't yet fully displayed their talents as artists, and are currently just super talented performers. An artist, in my opinion, is involved in the making of their art, which in this case, is music and dance, or at least, they are familiar with what they are performing. A performer is well trained imitator, who performs the art created by someone else and doesn't know much in depth about what they perform. As far as I know, it seems like Blackpink isn't familiar with the true meaning of what they perform, which is what leads most people to believe that their music has no depth and meaning behind it. Kill This Love sounds like any other Blackpink title track. But the lyrics of song? They might seem generic, but they aren't. One of the makers of song shared her story through these lyrics.  As for their latest release, How You Like That, people are dissing the lyrics again, especially, \u201cLook up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane.\u201d I know, it seems like a dumb lyric. But\u2026  It's a dialogue picked from Superman! The lyric directly references the classic quote from the introduction of the 1950s series, Adventures of Superman. The quote is often used to describe a powerful comeback. With this lyric in the context of the song, the girls are comparing themselves to Superman. In the preceding lyric, Ros\u00e9 sings about losing her \u201cwings\u201d and being trapped. However, they declare that they are past that phase and they are ready to soar higher than ever before. -Genius Clearly, their music isn't one dimensional. But it seems so. Because: Blackpink doesn't talk much about what their music means to them.There is not much versatility in their title tracks or stage performances. (For some reasons, some of the interesting parts of their choreography seen in dance practices are done differently on stage.)I haven't watched all of Blackpink's interviews and VLives, but from what I've seen (and heard), they haven't mentioned the Superman reference or the story behind Kill This Love, which indicates that they aren't as aware about what they're singing and dancing to. This makes them a group that's not substantial. However, having substantial music and being talented are unrelated to each other. Their music and performances might seem hollow, but they're talented, nonetheless. They're successful and popular for all the right reasons, but they're publicised for the wrong reasons. They are not \u201cthe Queens of K-pop\u201d.They are not the pioneers of girl crush.They are not unmatchable.They are not way better than any other K-pop group.They are not the female counterparts of BTS.Instead, They are Queens.They are a good girl crush group.They are very talented.They are a part of the K-pop industry.They are women of their own, who are successful because of their talent.So, Blackpink is overhyped, not overrated. They might not be as talented as BTS, but that doesn't mean they're shitty. In fact, Blackpink's rap line is one of the strongest rap lines in K-pop girl groups. They might be 'shouty', but I think that's better than being cringey. Check out See You Later to see how well Jennie can rap. Lisa is one of the best dancers in K-pop, and is at par with Momo and Seulgi. Ros\u00e9 and Jisoo have such unique voices. Some people say that their technique is not good, while some say otherwise. I'm not a vocal coach, neither do I have any knowledge about singing, so I can't comment on their technique. In my unprofessional opinion, they are great singers. So while Blackpink as a group lacks substance, they aren't downright bad. Each group has their own shortcomings, so does Blackpink. They are not undeserving of anything they have achieved so far. The only irksome thing about this group is their fandom, but I guess every fandom has their own rotten apples. Let's not bash these girls for the immaturity of their fandom.

            "answer_text": "No Blackpink are not overrated none groups you mentioned are overrated actually none of the idol groups are overrated! I would rather say they are underrated considering how much effort, time and energy is needed to become a idol.    Let's not forget that Blackpink was originally supposed to be a 9 member girl group and to get a 9 member group their has to be about 20 trainees. Now imagine, the four members of the group have been able to last longer than all the other trainees. Meaning that YGE probably saw something in them that only the 4 girls ended up debuting from a supposed group of 9 girls. In no way are this girls overrated. Now BTS were from a then smaller company and to reach the stage they are on right now they are not at all overrated and deserve every bit of fame they have received. Same with Twice they were selected out of 16 girls to become the 9 membered girl group we know and love. In no way would anyone will be able to say that they are untalented or overrated. Most kpop idols go through a severe training process which brings out the best in them. Many people think that to be an idol one has to be perfect all rounder and that's where everything goes wrong as no group is an all rounder group. They all have different flavours and styles if Blackpink has more badass vibe then Twice can make you happy anytime or you like bad boys then you have EXO or do you like inspiration and determination then listen to BTS. All groups have something different to you. Enjoy it while it lasts as we are running out of time with them. EXO members are enlisting one after another and it seems like obsession might be the last comeback for a while where as BTS are also running out of time and soon there would be a vacuum in the kpop scene. Twice are also nearing their 7 year contract expiration and you never know what might happen and the same is true for blackpink as well only they have a little bit more time but with the less amount of comebacks they get it just doesn't seem right. So just appreciate that this groups exist and are active because not many groups make even this far so support each and every one of them. \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "NO , BLACKPINK is not overrated. BLACKPINK is not on the the same \u201clevel\u201d as Bts because that isn't how idols are ranked. In my words, BLACKPINK is one of the most iconic groups and so is Bts. Then again, some armys love to rank other idols with Bts as the criteria (no offence). It's usually saesangs and fake and obsessive fans of other kpop groups who say that because they simply think their idols are the best and they always deserve the best, which isn't necessarily bad. But degrading and spreading rumours about other idols and down rating them isn't the way they should be stanning their idols. There are always some good and bad fans in every kpop group so that isn't a big issue but this matter has already gone out of hands\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb BLACKPINK is amazing in their way. I am a BLACKPINK Stan. But I love Bts and twice and EXO and red velvet because they deserve it.They are different music genres and styles and each one amazes me. Let's all stop down rating others and be kpop stans\ud83d\ude04 ",
