            "answer_text": "Sure. I\u2019ve played in bands where I play keys and do \u2018left hand bass\u2019 - but I much prefer to play bass for the bass lines. Some music requires synth bass - some really requires string bass. Not long ago, there was this myth/panic among drummers and bassists that we\u2019d all be replaced by sequencers & drum machines\u2026 and for a while there, things seemed to be headed in that direction. Happily, that never really came to pass. That said, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that in most top-40 pop music, everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - is synthesized. Some keyboard player has a riff and the rest is programming and autotuner. It\u2019s moving that way in pop CW (Nu country) as well. But if you don\u2019t listen to or play top-40 music, then you needn\u2019t worry about being replaced. ",

            "answer_text": "I know a band that has played together for years that is simply a 3 piece band, guitar, drums and keyboard. The keyboard player also played the bass lines on his keyboard and on many songs uses a sequencer to do just that. If you were in another room just listening you\u2019d swear there was a bass player. It just depends on the equipment you have at your disposal. If you can afford a top of the line Kurzweil for example you can practically be a one one band. There are several keyboards and also computer software that can do wonderful things. While recording an album in Hawaii my producer produced a new bass line on a few songs because he just didn\u2019t like the actual bass line and when you listen to the songs it has a great sound like a popping bass sound. You can reproduce just about any instrument with the right equipment and I defy you to tell the difference between the keyboard produced sound and the real instrument sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people on the keyboard have been able to achieve something like that. While I would never replace the sound, touch, flavor and feel of the strings (plus, I\u2019d be out of a job, hehe!) I can mention Ray Manzarek, from The Doors, where they played many of their most memorable songs without a bassist. Manzarek not only was able to replace the bass, but also gave us some of the most meorable keyboard lines. There might be some other cases out there. But they are few. Most of the times, nothing replaces the nice, strong, powerful punch of a bass. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. Sampler based VSTs have come a long way throughout the years. Chances are a lot of music people listen today and think they are hearing real instruments are actually using VST. http://media.soundsonline.com/mp3/Let-Me-Go-Web.mp3 That was made entirely with Ministry of Rock 2, a VST package. I find it very convincing. Edit: I\u2019m a little tired and read your question without paying attention to \u201csynthesizer\u201d. So my answer is only valid if you have a loose interpretation of synthesizers. Clearly, a modern VST is not a sine wave with some effects over it. It uses real instrument audio modified to be controlled by the user. ",

Bass guitar is a pretty highly developed instrument, and a big part of the styles you mention, so you should expect doing this to be about as hard as just learning to play the bass. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, just expect it to be a very large project. ",

We used to use acoustic drums and then the drum machine happened. The sax used to take all the solos and then the electric guitar happened. If you feel like running an accordion through a distortion pedal feel free to do that also. You just might make a new sound that becomes copied by many bands. ",

If you really want to do it right it will take loads of experimentation. You want the same sonic space to be filled. That is possible with the right equipment. You want the same attack and attitude? You've got to have the right kind of player. Bass needs the right attitude. Supportive, aggressive, melodic, laid back\u2026or a combo of all\u2026 Good luck my friend. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely. You will have to pick your effects and voicing very well though. For example, in metal, you may not want to have a sound that swirls or wows. A wah sound may be acceptable, but rarely. However, your basic sine, square, or sawtooth wave, with or without glide, and from zero to a lot of distortion will be nice. A sound with a sharp attack like clavinova-ish stuff would work great too. ",

The bass synth made us sound like soft cheese. In my opinion there's no substitute for a proper rythim section, and that is always bass guitar and drums. ",
