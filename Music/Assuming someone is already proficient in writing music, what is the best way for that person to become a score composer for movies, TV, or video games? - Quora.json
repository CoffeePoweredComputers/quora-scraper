You have to work your way up and it takes a while. You have to be okay with a lot of people saying no and you have to understand how competitive the business is. A lot of music being pumped out commercially like this is very similar in quality and style to the kinds of really well produced pop songs out there now. There is not really job security in this business especially for people new to scene, it\u2019s literally survival of the fittest. ",
