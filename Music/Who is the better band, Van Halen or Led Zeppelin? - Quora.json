            "answer_text": "Doh!!! Is this a serious question??? Uh,,,,, ZEPPELIN obviously without a doubt! Ok, I am sorry, I will get more serious with my answer and quit messing with ya\u2026. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Halen did much great things, especially at a time when decent hard rock guitar driven popular music was beginning to really lag. Some might even say that Van Halen saved the 80\u2019s or at least was one of the few artists that stood the test of time and can listen to and not cringe\u2026 Eddie obviously came out on top as the new generation of technical guitar slinger virtuoso. Eddie\u2019s brown sound Marshall and dive bomb whammy bar partscasters created a whole new trend in emerging new electric guitar look , design and popular culture. Also, I like to point out that Van Halen was also a Los Angeles home grown local band too!!! Zeppelin adopted LA as there touring home base home away from home! That said,,,, LED ZEPPELIN SET THE STANDARD. Zep was the guys that set the stage. Certainly the top band of those original rock acts that defined and for who (oh yes the Who too) the legendary exccess of what a bad ass heavy rockstar was all about! They paved the way and set the example that every other Rock Star aspired to be\u2026. If no Zep, doubtful we would have had a Van Halen. The youngsters from the LA Basin were just kids doing and acting like what they thought the stereotypical rock star should be\u2026 Not that the Zep were just poster boys for rockstar lifestyle. They contributed mapped out alot of the things that brought about the formula, standards and procedures within the music industry. They innovated the logistics of a band taking the show on the road. Creating their own big productions and employing their own crews and bringing their own gear, backline and sound reinforcement, lighting and started an industry, showing the profit in touring. Zeppelin\u2019s insistance on building and producing full albums and no creation of remixed single 45\u2019s or tracks cut with specific radio play formats. This indirectly had profound effect within the broadcast industry and \u201cLed\u201d the way to a new format that found widespread adoption as rock music emergence upon the FM dial in what was deemed \u201cAlbum Oriented Rock\u201d(presently referred to as ClassicRock) This Format was long unrecognized and undefined by the standards of regular Pop Music Charts such as the sorry ass Top 40 hits market. Hence making the Classic Rock demographic even more of a illicit, rebelous, underworld, counter culture stoner reputation or genre that was lightly recognized in the mainstream. Yet they sold and sold well and continue to sell to this day. Showing execs the profit in signing bands like Van Halen. Jimmy Page brought about what loud is all about. After Peter Green, Clapton on Beeno, it was Jimmy Page that made the brown sound and helped sell Marshall but even more so brought the Les Paul into its legendary status as such a fine instrument that certain examples today are revered as much as the Stativarus of classical status. Surely Page isnt the fastest or technically purist accomplished guitarist but he certainly one of the greatest of the British Blues innovators to bring back the blues to America and certainly him and his two other peers created the hard rock blues that so dominates modern guitar rock music to this day. His studio contributions are large and varied. As a young studio musician his untitled and unrecognized contribution to much of the British Invasion reads like a who\u2019s who\u2019s list of some the greatest hits to cross the pond. Much of Van Halen cut their teeth on covering artists in which Page played those original tell tale recognized riffs. Think Dave Davies? Yeah but many of those tracks in the studio were Page. HE WAS ALREADY A VETRAN WHEN HE TOOK TO THE YARDBIRDS. Yeah Eddie shreds and Sammy was every bit the personality as David Lee Roth and ya gotta take note at just what a great Drummer Alex is,,, in fact I dont think Alex gets the accolades he truly deserves, he is good! But nobody hits the Hammer like John Bonham did or likely ever will\u2026. Hail Hammer of the Gods LED ZEPPELIN RULES AND IS RIGHT UP THERE AS ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS OF ALL TIME AND CONTINUES TO STAND THE TEST Van Halen is good but not nearly as great or as legendary. I may not be the biggest Van Halen fan but do have respect and they certainly are a legend but not as tall as Zep! ",

            "answer_text": "Although neither of these groups will ever be on my all-time favorites list, I feel comfortable assessing both fairly. The short answer is that Led Zeppelin is the far greater band. My rationale is as follows: The songs. Without question, Led Zeppelin wrote better songs. Or should I say, Led Zeppelin appropriated and updated better songs. In either case, their songs have endured - even those not written as hits. Van Halen did produce some good singles, but few of their album tracks have had staying power. Edge LZ.The chops. Eddie Van Halen was a transformative guitarist. He paved the way for metal shredders with pop leanings, which was critical to the popularity of hair metal. Alex Van Halen made a lot of noise and kept time pretty well. Mike Anthony was a competent bass player. David Lee Roth was an amazing front man, with a good voice and great personna. The other guys are irrelevant. For Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page was one of the all-time great rock guitarists. After having great success on the Telecaster with the Yardbirds and as a studio player, he defined the 1970s Les Paul sound (with Mick Ronson). Page was also a fantastic acoustic player. Lastly, his use of studio overdubs and multi-tracking was at the time unique. John Paul Jones was a very musical bassist who carried the band during altered-tempo songs. John Bonham was an excellent hard rock drummer who could also accommodate playing mellower songs. Robert Plant was the weak link in Led Zeppelin, but he was certainly a competent hard rock singer. Edge LZ.Long-term influence. Van Halen provided a superb gateway into pop metal. Led Zeppelin didn\u2019t invent riff rock (The Kinks and Yardbirds really did), but they made it the mainstay of hard rock for decades. Edge LZ.In sum, Led Zeppelin wins by much more than a nose. ",
