            "answer_text": "What you called as weird would be called as experimentation and innovation from many musician. The fact that it was this experimentation, keep pushing forward their music to the boundaries, inventing new song and sound so that none of their song sounded similar is what made them so heralded. In answer to were they concerned their albums wouldn\u2019t sell well?Of course there is some concern. But it never bother them much. They know they have to progress, they don\u2019t want to repeat themself. They were influenced by others of their peers as well as influencing of course, namely such The Beach Boys (who they perceived as their friendly main competitor), and The Who. They started their transformation at around Rubber Soul album then culminate on their weird \u2018concept album\u2019 of Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Infact, The Beatles lose some of their early fans with this transformation. But in return they gained a much wider audience and benefited on the long run. The [Revolver] album was the source of confusion for the group's more conservative fans. A female fan later complained in Beatles Monthly that 1966 represented the end of \"The Beatles we used to know before they went stark, raving mad\".  The Beatles were aware of this, but they made a fully conscious decision to moving forward and keep pushing their music. \u201cWe'll lose some fans with [the new album], but we'll also gain some. The fans we'll probably lose will be the ones who like the things about us that we never liked anyway\u2026\u201d\u2014 Paul McCartney about Revolver album, June 1966 Progressing and experimenting is what drive them forward, it\u2019s one of the reason why The Beatles were so revered. They took influence and inspiration from all around them but made it unique to be original of their own. They\u2019re not follower, they were the Trendsetter. They were proven right though, as their rival and musician after them told. There\u2019s no outdoing The Beatles.Sgt Pepper Lonely Heart Club Band is probably the greatest single album I've ever heard.\u2014 Brian Wilson - The Beach Boys.They were a great influence to us because they were songwriters. They broke a lot of rules and they created an artistic credibility in the pop music business, which was never there before. \u2014 Robin Gibbs - Bee Gees.PS :Pot and LSD maybe help a little ;pHey, long before Bob Marley fall in love with Rasta. Paul already made an \u2018ode to pot\u2019 song on \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life\u201d released on Revolver album. ",

            "answer_text": "The 1960\u2019s was a weird decade. It wasn\u2019t \u2018straight\u2019 as this era is now. The Beatles just followed the zeitgeist of the times. Or possibly led it. The decade itself was alive with change and all intuitive musicians tapped into it. The Beatles were all about constant change. They hated repetition of earlier themes. Today it's all about turning out music that never changes and also never inspires. Most of us with a toehold in that era (I was only a child) believe that the future turned out all wrong. If only things had continued in that trajectory until now life would be so much more electric. Instead we have a sub-standard firmament to live in and be disillusioned with. The Beatles had enough talent and charisma to know that they would always sell. The fact that you call it \u201cweird\u201d says a lot about these moribund times I think. ",
