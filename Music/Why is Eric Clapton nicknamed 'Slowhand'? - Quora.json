            "answer_text": "Eric Clapton is arguably the best guitar player of all times and frequently compared to Jimi Hendrix. However when we look at Clapton's key legendary songs, the shredding comes down to slower elongated shreds and it's as if he is making his guitar sing along the song or \u2018weep' with all puns intended. Check out the below cover track tribute song While my Guitar Gently weeps from Concert for George Harrison. You will know why he is the one and only, Clapton the 'SlowHand'.(The magic starts mainly at around 3:33 minutes into the song.) While others think of guitar skills as fast shreds, Clapton played a whole different game and created something magical with his unique style. Citing something from Google though for precise information:- In Clapton - The Autobiography (2007), Eric had this to say, \"On my guitar I used light-gauge guitar strings, with a very thin first string, which made it easier to bend the notes, and it was not uncommon during the most frenetic bits of playing for me to break at least one string. During the pause while I was changing my string, the frenzied audience would often break into a slow handclap, inspiring Giorgio to dream up the nickname of 'Slowhand' Clapton.\" Hats off to this great legend indeed.

            "answer_text": "Ah, I read about this recently - apparently the audience would launch themselves into a slow applause while he replaced his guitar strings on stage.   The nickname \u201cSlowhand\u201d was not, as is commonly thought, given to Clapton due to playing the guitar slowly.  Rather, it was given to him because of audiences giving him a slow hand clap when he would replace guitar strings on stage.  Rather than go off-stage to fix it or have it fixed by a roady, Clapton would typically stand on stage and replace and tune the string in front of the audience.  While he was doing this, the audience would give him a slow clap or a \u201cslow hand\u201d until he had fixed it and was ready to play again.  This ultimately became a common thing with Clapton, while with the Yardbirds, where whenever he\u2019d break a string during a performance, the audience would give him a slow clap until he was finished replacing it.  According to Clapton, Giorgio Gomelsky, who managed the Yardbirds, then gave him the nickname \u201cSlowhand\u201d: \u201cHe coined it as a good pun. He kept saying I was a fast player, so he put together the slow handclap phrase into Slowhand as a play on words.\u201d Source: The Woman Eric Clapton Thought was His Sister was Actually His Mother ",
