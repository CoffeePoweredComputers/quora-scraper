            "answer_text": "Amazon or a Reasonable Korean Store. The first 2 albums I ever got were Thriller and Born to Beat, BTOB\u2019s 1st and 3rd mini album. Being American, and not knowing of any stores here that sell their albums, I got them off of Amazon. They were in good condition, and my copy of Thriller actually came with a signed photo card. Korean stores online will also probably offer albums, but make sure to compare prices. Albums aren\u2019t cheap, and you also have to remember that you might have to pay for shipping. I\u2019m not overly familiar with SM and EXO, but they might have a specific website where they sell merchandise in addition to the albums. If not, there are probably other stores willing to sell you their album (I nearly bought BTS\u2019s Wings album from Your Online Store for Korean Stationery, Books, and More so it might be worth a shot there). Hope this helps!! Best of luck in trying to buy their album! ",

            "answer_text": "Amazon marketplace will be easiest and most convenient - there are a number of companies that sell Kpop music reliably this way, and some use Amazon distribution, especially for the popular titles. You will certainly be able to purchase EXO\u2019s latest, although I am not sure if the availability will be the same release dates as in Korea. You can download off iTunes or Amazon music, or similar digital music stores online. I\u2019ve purchased Super Junior Kyuhyun\u2019s solo mini albums this way without issues; before that, I have purchased from YesAsia some years back (based out of Hong Kong, generally expensive, but reliable), and Taiwanese albums from books.com.tw. Usually things ship internationally by DHL, but if you go via Amazon, direct or marketplace, it most often has already passed customs, so it will arrive more quickly. ",
