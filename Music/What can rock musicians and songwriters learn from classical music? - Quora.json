            "answer_text": "Through-form lyrics, ie poetry. Voice leading, aka. counterpoint. Motivic development. Form. Through-form lyrics from art songs use complexer poetic devices than generally found in rock/normal-contemporary-songwriting. Complex is not necessarily better, but writing simpler music often can be achieved with greater elegance and quality when complexer varieties are understood. An understanding of voice leading and counterpoint from Baroque music can beef up Rock solos. The music of JS Bach, specifically the fugues is about as beefy as you can get. If you want to jump in the deep end have a look at the Kunst der Fuge. Generally JS Bach has so much to offer all musicians when it comes to how to handle the relationships of melody to it\u2019s counter melody. Motivic development found in early classical music (Mozart) again has a lot to offer when it comes to it\u2019s advanced handling and development. Perhaps Jazzers have more to learn from Mozart and Co. than Rock/Songwriters since much of Jazz is motivic development upon reharmonizations of chords. Nonetheless much of Rock is similar to Jazz and although it is not primarily improvised the motivic development found in Mozart and Co. gives a good backbone to how many riffs one can develop from a very simple idea. Form in Rock and standard contemporary Songwriting is relatively simple. But again, going back to the first point - if you understand more complex Form structures, analyzing the simpler ones and working with them becomes a piece of cake. In all of these three areas classical music is in my opinion the most advanced as compared to other genres. So there is plenty that rock musicians and songwriters can learn from classical music. ",

            "answer_text": "The previous answer is from the point of view of someone who\u2019s maybe not so into rock music that stylistically borrows heavily from classical music, what we\u2019d call progressive rock or \u201cprog.\u201d I personally don\u2019t share that dislike but I get it, it\u2019s really not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. With that being said, I absolutely can tell you one way a rock musician (or any musician) can benefit from a healthy appreciation of classical music. When you listen closely you begin to hear how all of the instruments work together to create the whole of the piece. Melody and countermelody, the use of different registers produced by different instruments to create particular effects, be they sweeping and epic or subtle, light or dark. This approach can bring a songwriter to new heights of creativity, leading one to think of how the guitars, bass, drums, and vocals (and keyboard and any other instruments used) can work together as a whole rather than, say, a riff on the guitar and everything else just backing that up. Not only that but classical music can also show us the importance of dynamics, where we can use volume as effectively as the notes themselves, increasing and decreasing to create a more emotive piece. Those aspects, in my opinion, are of far more value than the technical. I guess the short answer really is, listen to everything. The more music you hear, the more you grow as a musician. ",
