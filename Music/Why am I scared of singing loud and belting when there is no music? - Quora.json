            "answer_text": "is most likely that you are scared when you do this because you still lack confidence in your abilities. The only way to dispel this fear is through knowledge. When you know that you can sing properly when you know that you can hear your voice the instant you sing and there's no delay which will cause you to sing out of pitch and cause you to sing out of sync you'll be able to sing better and more confidently. When you know the piece of music you're singing so well that you don't even have to think about it, it just comes out, it will also help you when you are so good at singing whatever it is you're going to sing that you can teach others to do it that is when you can have confidence to do it as well. It is confidence in my opinion even though I don't know you, I know myself and I'm a singer. Learn more about you. Make it comfortable for yourself to sing make sure you can hear your voice the instant it comes out of your mouth which is not always easy to do. ",
