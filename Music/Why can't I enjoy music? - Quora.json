            "answer_text": "If you really are incapable of enjoying music, the good news is that you are not alone. The bad news is that you may have to wait for longer to know 'why'. A recently published study has revealed that not everybody enjoys listening to music, and its findings seem to be in sync with how you describe your response to music.  The effects of music on physical and mental health have long been discussed. It has also been a matter of research as to whether humans are genetically wired to respond to music, albeit to different degrees. This is an interesting read-up about The Genetic Mystery of Music. While we are yet to arrive at concrete and definite conclusions, it is generally agreed that music is something that most humans, even unborn babies, are equipped to enjoy. The positive effects of music, or 'enjoyment' as the colloquialism goes, are attributed to the release of endorphins that listening to music causes in the brain. The said study, however, noticed that some of its subjects, when exposed to music, responded differently\u2014that is, by not responding at all. The researchers link it to the brain's way of interpreting and deciding on reward-systems. From The Verge's article on the same:  Although these participants were perfectly capable of perceiving when a tune was sad or happy, they didn't show physical or emotional reaction. They didn't shiver if a singer hit a high note, and their heart rate didn't increase with each crescendo. But when asked to play a game involving a monetary reward, those who were indifferent to music reacted just like everyone else: the thought of winning even a small amount of money was enough to make their hearts race. The results were unchanged a year later, when 26 of the students took the test again. But we shouldn't mistake an indifference to music for dislike, Marco-Pallar\u00e9s says. When students were asked to describe their affinity for music on a scale of one to ten, for example, those who were indifferent usually answered with the number five \u2014 the mathematical equivalent of a shrug. Researchers even have a name for the condition: \"specific musical anhedonia.\" The term anhedonia is used by psychologists to describe a person's inability to derive pleasure from activities that most find enjoyable. But as the monetary-reward experiment indicates, this specific anhedonia only affects music perception. \"Now that we know that there are people with specific musical anhedonia,\" Marco-Paller\u00e9s says, \"we want to know the neural bases that might explain [it].\" The research team plans to conduct a new experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study how the brain's reward system differs in these people. This is first experiment to demonstrate that anhedonia can be specific to a single form of reward, so many questions remain unanswered. There might be other forms of specific anhedonia that we don't know about yet, Marco-Paller\u00e9s says. But the fact that the first form to be identified is related to music is interesting in and of itself, he says, because from an evolutionary standpoint, it's hard to explain why we like music in the first place. \"Music doesn't give us access to biologically relevant advantages,\" he says, the way food or money does. \"The emotions are the key point in this reward.\" So, from a survival standpoint, there's no disadvantage to being indifferent to music. As Marco-Paller\u00e9s puts it, you just end up with \"people who don't understand why anyone would pay to go to a concert.\" Do note that people who are physiologically affected by music don't just enjoy it. The whole point is that music always evokes some kind of emotions in them\u2014pleasure, repulsion, fear, sadness, irritation, and so on. Do you feel absolutely nothing when listening to music? Although I don't get why you should be embarrassed on being caught trying to listen to music. Make sure you aren't trying to live up to some kind of impression or image you have carved for yourself, to stand out or otherwise. It's completely okay to not have any fondness for music today and suddenly fall in love with it tomorrow. And if music indeed has no effect on you, big deal? Doesn't look like there is anything for you to be worried about. You are probably missing out on one of the many forms of entertainment that humans resort to, and that's okay because that form of entertainment is of no use to you if it cannot entertain you.  As for not being able to join your friend in enjoying Justin Beiber, I don't think you're missing out on anything that special. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is wrong with you. Some of us love cake while others hate it. Maybe you just haven't found the right style yet, or maybe, you don't love it because you don't need to love it yet. I love music, but for reasons not everyone relates to. Others listen to music to dance, to have a simple background filler to mask the silence that makes them uncomfortable. I love music because it is my friend. Whenever I'm down, it's always there to pick me right back up. It's always been there for me, both, on my good days and bad days, cheering me on, and cheering me up. I think that you will eventually like music. The first time I heard dubstep, I thought to myself what the hell happened to society? I stopped listening to it, but as my need for music grew, I started liking when I gave it another shot a while later, and today, I find myself asking myself what the hell happened to me? Give it some time to grow on you. You know that saying you don't know what you have until it's gone? Shut out music entirely, and maybe then you'll find your answer, whether you could live like that forever, or whether you find yourself dancing to the beat you didn't hear in so long. After all, that is the point of music, to make you happy with or without it, because silence in its own form is also a type of music, a song we all hear and interpret differently. Hope this helped.
