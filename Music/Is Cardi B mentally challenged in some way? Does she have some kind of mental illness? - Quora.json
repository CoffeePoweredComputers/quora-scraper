Idk, maybe I\u2019m wrong. Nevertheless, she\u2019s clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed. For example, she posts some really disturbing things on IG sometimes, which isn\u2019t necessarily bad, but she does it in a way such that you can tell she thinks she\u2019s being artistic and profound, but she\u2019s just not, and she just doesn\u2019t get it. Cardi B demonstrates regularly that she\u2019s a bit lacking in self-awareness. Mental disability or not, she\u2019s noticeably unintelligent. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t uncommon for celebrities to have mental illnesses, given that they are celebrities, therefore I would not doubt the fact that she does. These mental illnesses can include depression, anxiety etc.. Now if you meant to mental disabilities like autism, OCD etc., then that\u2019s another story. I am aware that depression and anxiety are both disabilities as well but they are harder to spot. In conclusion the only way to really know is to ask them personally but that can be rude, so ideally they should be the one to tell you if they have a diagnosed illness or disability. ",
