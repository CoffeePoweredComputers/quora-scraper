            "answer_text": "\u201cThird Week In The Chelsea\" Sometimes I feel like i am leaving life behind My hands are moving faster Than the movement of my mind. Thoughts and generations Of my dreams are yet unborn, I hope that I will find them \u2018fore my moving gets too worn, If only I could live to see The dawning of the dawn So we go on moving Trying to make this image real, Straining every nerve Not knowing what we really feel, Straining every nerve ending And everybody sees That what they read in the Rolling Stone Has really come to be, And I\u2019m trying to avoid a taste Of that reality. On an early New York mornin' A mirror in the hall Showed to me a face I didn't know at all. Lines were drawn around A pair of eyes that opened wide And when I looked into them I found nothing left inside, So I walked into the little room And whistled like a sigh. As dawn light closed around me, though, My head was still in gear, Thinking thoughts of playing more, Of singing loud and clear, Trying to reach a friend somewhere And make that person smile, Maybe pull myself away From that old lonesome mile That often comes to haunt me In the morning. All my friends keep telling me That it would be a shame To break up such a grand success, Tear apart a name, But all I know is what I feel Whenever I'm not playin', Emptiness ain't where it's at And neither's feeling pain... Well now, what is going to happen now Is anybody's guess. If I can't spend my time in love, I guess I need a rest. The time is getting late now And the sun is getting low, My body's getting tired Of carryin' another's load And sunshine's waiting for me A little further down the road.

            "answer_text": "In terms of lyrics? I\u2019m Fine by Hazel English. It\u2019s a mellow song with a vibe similar of that to Stranger Things. Really long story short, I come from a rather dysfunctional and poor family, so it\u2019s a no-brainer that heated arguments are frequent. It is no joke when I say my grades decide the fate of my family. There are other aspects of our history that are significant but I\u2019d prefer not to say yet. All the disputes in our family are usually aggressive and they all affect me. After each argument, my dad and mum would come to me at separate times and ask me to not let what\u2019s happening at home affect me or my studies. And it sucks whenever they do that because I have to say it doesn\u2019t affect me in any way. I hate how I have to put on a brave face and go about my life because it really hurts inside. A month ago, there was a festival near me. My friends and I decided to go and I thought I was having a great time. There was a dark voice in the back of my mind that kept on reminding me of the hardship my family was going through. Soon enough, I started realising that I was putting on fake smiles, my laughs sounded hollow and I tuned my friends out. I slowly drifted from my group and eventually found myself alone in middle of a crowded street. There was so much laughter and chatter, but it was all white noise to me. I went walking around so I could look for my friends. What I was really doing was finding comfort. I put on my earphones and played this song on loop. \u2018I have never felt more alone in this world.\u2019 This is what went through my mind as I wandered through the packs of joyful people. That night, I watched the fireworks alone at a little park. During that day, I realised that I have no one to help me in this dark time. This is why this song describes me, no matter what happens, I have to say \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019. I don\u2019t want my friends to know this horrific life of mine and I certainly don\u2019t want my family to think they\u2019re the cause of my sorrow. So, yeah. ",
