            "answer_text": "Yes, you can use any electric guitar effects pedals with an acoustic, just so long as the acoustic has on-board electrics which you use a guitar cable to connect. You could also use effects with a microphone, but it is a little more complicated. The effects will sound different in some ways, modulation type effects such as: Delay, Chorus, Flange will work. Distortion, overdrive and fuzz will also work, in fact some players use acoustic guitars for electric sounding guitar work on recorded albums. The effects sound different because the acoustic pickups are usually specifically designed to render the acoustic nature of the guitar, but because this is also an electrical pulse it will be processed by the effect. Experimentation and trying stuff out is highly recommended - have a go and see if you like the results, that is the best way. ",

            "answer_text": "If the acoustic guitar has an output jack, then yes. As far as how the sound will differ from the electric guitar, it will vary depending on the type of effect you're using.  For example, if you use distortion pedals on an acoustic-electric guitar you're going to run into a lot of sensitivity issues. Typically you'll get alot of feedback if the gain is turned up too high. That's not to say you can't use distortion on an acoustic guitar, you'll just need to play with the levels a little more. Two effects that typically work well with acoustic are Chorus and Reverb. They are more texture-based effects than drive, so they'll add some \"color\" to your sound rather than just boosting it. ",

            "answer_text": "Most effects will result in feedback problems. In the 1950\u2019s Gibson installed a center block all the through their hollow body guitars plus the made the guitars thinner to stop feedback at loud volumes. There are some acoustic guitar such as the Taylor T-5 that may allow some success with a guitar pedal. The solid spruce top allows for greater deflection and this makes it difficult for guitar pedal effects to work without feedback. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it will differ. It will sound like your acoustic guitar with the effect layered on top. I used to plug in my acoustic to an old Line6 POD and actually loved it. I love the sound of the acoustic but then you layer on a delay or reverb and it sounds so lush and will inspire you to write licks. The best answer to your question is, close your laptop, plug in your guitar and play and enjoy. It is worth it. Upvote yourself for that. ",

If it is a flanger, it will flange, an echo will repeat, an eq will eq, and a distortion pedal will produce square wave distortion etc\u2026it will still sound like an acoustic guitar except for the distotion type effects.

            "answer_text": "Yes you can plug your acoustic guitar in any effect pedal/unit. But of course the sound will not be the same because you're not using the same guitar. There is also dedicated effects for acoustic guitars. With an acoustic guitar you might get a thinner sound, sometimes more feedback. The effects will not react the same. ",
