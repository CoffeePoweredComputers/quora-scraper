Now I do not do either of the latter 2 but I \u201chear\u201d the music in my head. If you don\u2019t \u201chear\u201d the music, then perhaps start with your idea for a song and write out the lyrics. If you have any melody ideas perhaps you could find a friend or someone who plays an instrument or if you do, pick out the tune on whatever instrument you have. Find someone in your area who is involved in composing or playing and take your ideas to him/her and see if they can help you. I wish you well. ",
