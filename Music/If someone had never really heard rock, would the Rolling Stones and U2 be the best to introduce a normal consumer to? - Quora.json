            "answer_text": "U2 absolutely not. And I say that as a someone who was a legitimate fan once, and still enjoys some of their material today. Instrumentally, their playing is often atypical of what many would regard as fairly standard rock music. Whether by design or because of limitations. Whether you love or hate Bono\u2019s lyrics, he has a distinctive way with words, and covers topics that aren\u2019t especially usual of rock music (more so in their earlier material), or at least are examined from a somewhat different perspective. Rolling Stones \u2014 maybe. Kinda sorta. There is no argument they\u2019re historically relevant, and embody the rock & roll spirit as well or better than most. I think part of my reluctance with them, is Jagger\u2019s voice. I\u2019m not a great fan of his singing \u2014 he suffers from MPM (Mashed Potato Mouth) syndrome to my ears. Albeit I\u2019d never want anyone else to front the Stones, ever (aside from the odd song sung by Keith - and he too has a less than an aesthetically soaring voice \u2014 much less); that is the voice of the Rolling Stones, all imperfections notwithstanding. But god forbid anyone would hear his voice and think \u2018Oh, so that\u2019s what a fairly typical rock vocalist sounds like!\u2019 I\u2019d run with the Beatles and Led Zeppelin, personally. The former to convey that rock music can run the gamut from very basic and straightforward to strikingly avant-garde. And the latter to demonstrate that it can encompass light electric and delicate acoustic sounds, as well as pounding, punishing riffs and banshee keening, sometimes even in the same song. ",

            "answer_text": "Tough question to answer, because you have a wide range of artists to choose from (unless we\u2019re just talking about hard rock). For example, you probably need to introduce them to first Elvis, Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Buddy Holly (at least) from the birth of rock. You simply can\u2019t ignore The Beatles, who (IMHO) took basic rock and altered it in so many different ways. Most influential and important band ever, again in my opinion. They have to be included. The Stones are arguably the original mold for what a typical rock band looks and acts like today, so they have to be included. The Who were the first or one of the first practitioners of hard rock / punk rock, so they need to be on the list. Zeppelin was a blues band that enhanced hard rock. They weren\u2019t the first, but they were important for their time. U2 can be included. I find them a closer cousin to The Beatles (you could almost take any track from Achtung Baby and drop it into the middle of The White Album, and it would fit). I personally don\u2019t think they\u2019re as influential as some or all of the bands listed above, but that can at least be argued. There you go. My answer, based soley on my subjective opinion\u2026 ",
