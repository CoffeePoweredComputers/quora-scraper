            "answer_text": "I would argue it was Beethoven. Prior to him musicians were usually in the employ of some wealthy patron, a nobleman, a bishop or if lucky a king. They often wore the livery of that patron, just like a valet or footman. At some point in his career Mozart had to ask permission to travel to perform in other towns or to listen to other composers and orchestras. Beethoven earned a living by providing works for the new public concert halls so he didn\u2019t depend on the goodwill of a single patron. Also he is the first to adopt the mystique of The Artiste as someone special and worthy of admiration. There is a story that while he was walking with Goethe they crossed path with a prince. Goethe saluted the prince and after an awkward pause the prince saluted back and only then did Beethoven salute. Afterward Goethe scolded him for failing to salute the prince first as his status demanded but Beethoven replied that the prince was what he was by an accident of birth while he himself was what he was because of his own genius. If that doesn\u2019t spell superstar nothing does. Question: Who is the first ever music superstar? ",
