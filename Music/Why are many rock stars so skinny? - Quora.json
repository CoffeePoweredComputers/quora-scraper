            "answer_text": " There are certainly many reasons. Have you ever seen Bruce Springsteen in concert? I'd term him fit, even today, over skinny. But he still plays 3-4 hour concerts, and he's not just standing around, but running, jumping up on things, etc. In fact, early on, Bruce was kind of a skinny guy, and reportedly finished up concerts exhausted. In order to keep up that kind of energy as he got older, The Boss got serious about heath: good diet, no drugs, alternate days running and hitting the gym.  Now, Mick Jagger has always been skinny -- he's had a 28\u2033 waist his entire career. But like Springsteen, he's maintained a very athletic stage act, and he's currently 75 years old. He managed this by becoming a fitness fanatic. The Stones, as a group, have 200 people employed during a tour for fitness, nutrition, diet, etc. Jagger was, at least a few years ago, on a ketogenic diet, very low in carbohydrates (as low as 5% of total diet). And no drugs for Mick.  Iggy Pop's another famously skinny rock star, and lots of people probably assumed it was the drugs. Because long ago, it probably was the drugs. But no one taking rock star level drugs is still running around on stage for hours with his shirt off at age 71. Years ago, when working with David Bowie in Berlin, Iggy got healthy. He works out, practices several martial arts including Tai Chi, and drinks just a glass of red wine after concerts. I did concentrate on lead singers here, as they're often the skinny face of the band. Other musicians have other fitness regimes needed to do their jobs. And that's the key factor here: after the initial amazing luck of being discovered and building a fan base as a rock musician, there are usually only two ways to go: you work extremely hard to maintain that job, or you get lazy, drugged out, whatever and fail at it. To keep going, it's much the same thing a professional athlete does to keep going. A guy like Bruce or Mick can easily cover 4-6 miles on stage in a night -- not that much different than a professional soccer player during a match.  Or watch your favorite drummer on-stage for a 2-3 hour show\u2026 that's an amazing bit of athleticism as well as musicianship.

            "answer_text": "Well Many of them are very young, which helps in being able to control weight and lose it even if you don\u2019t particularly try all that hard to control your weight. Ever see what young men eat?Part of being successful in entertainment is that you be somewhat attractive, and in the business, that typically means being on the slim side. Rock stars have every incentive to look as good as they can, particularly if they are wearing tight or body conscious clothing (and many of them do).Performing is WORK. These guys travel, then they get on stage and are active for at least two hours in concert. All that jumping around and running around, and singing and playing burns a LOT of calories. If you are out of shape it will impact your ability to perform.Excessive drug/alcohol use or addictions has the effect of reducing/cutting out your appetite. Not eating enough food while you are touring and performing will pretty much guarantee you stay slim.Many of them as they get older do start to take care of themselves so that they can continue performing\u2014the Rolling Stones, for example, are all now ex-druggies who are meticulous about their diets at this point. Given that they are all over 70, they apparently reversed their bad habits just in time before those habits had a chance to really screw them up. Bruce Springsteen is close to 70 at this point and he still is in great shape-as far as I know he\u2019s never abused drugs or alcohol, so he\u2019s probably always had those good habits and it is reaping benefits for him now.",
