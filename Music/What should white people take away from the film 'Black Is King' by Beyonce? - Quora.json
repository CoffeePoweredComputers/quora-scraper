            "answer_text": "Firstly that Beyonce is an amazing artist. Not just musically. But also visually. But, plausibly, also, that we are in an age of crude affirmations. Black people seem to feel the need to be told they are beautiful and noble in kitschy Disnified dance numbers. Just as white people feel the need to be told how great America is and how much better they are than everyone else by whiney blowhards. The fact that there's such a market for crude affirmations across all races suggests that there's something very sick about contemporary society, which is starving us of the resources we need to build real intrinsic self-confidence and sense of our own value. And of course we should all know what that is. Consumer capitalism has no interest in us feeling satisfied and self-sufficient. It needs us to feel that we lack something so it can sell us something to fill that hole. And that we are worthless unless we work even harder to earn more to buy more. Capitalism has long ago co-opted hip-hop, the greatest contemporary black artform, and twisted it to that message. And it's unsurprising that Beyonce, a product of that scene, can't escape it. As long as we leave that economic system in place, corporations like Disney will see racism and denigration of black people not as a problem to be solved, but as an opportunity to sell short-term palliative \u201cfixes\u201d. Beyonce is an amazing artist, though. And there's nothing wrong with using art to make us feel good. Or to give us some catharsis to help us bear our pain. Black is King is a beautiful but tragic film full of suffering : though largely hinted at obliquely. And maybe the film provides release. It is awfully aestheticised though. That may or may not be a good thing. Maybe that aestheticism helps to reach and touch more people and raise awareness. OTOH maybe it cements the archetypes of the tragic black man, and his even more suffering tragic black mother, in place. And makes it harder for us to imagine things could be any different. I can't adjudicate that. I can have an opinion on the potential problems, but it's for the black community to decide how to respond to this film. Does it ultimately nourish and uplift and energise, or ultimately reinforce dis-empowering kitschy stereotypes? ",
