            "answer_text": "That would easily be BLACLPINK. Now,let me clarify that I LOVE both BTS and BLACKPINK but honestly this question is quite hysterical. Now this isn't neglecting the talents or the hard work the members of BLACKPINK have put into their careers. In fact, the members of BLACKPINK trained for 4\u20136 years, living an off-camera \u201csurvival\u201d show. They were meant to debut in 2012 with 9 members but ended up debuting in 2016 with 4 members, as they watched their closest friends leave. Coming from YG entertainment (the company that holds kpop legends BIG BANG), BLACKPINK had a huge advantage, since YG entertainment is part of the \u201cBig 3\u201d agencies. From debut to now, BLACKPINK have only 2 mini albums and 13 songs only, despite being around for 3 years. They have the most viewed kpop group song,were the first kpop girl group to perform at Coachella and have sold out 99% of their world tour revenue. They have a HUGE fan base and are considered BTS\u2019 biggest competitors in the Western market. Now let's talk about BTS. BTS debuted in 2013 from a very small, unknown company known as \u201cBighit entertainment\u201d. The group was formed around leader \u201cRM\u201d. They didn't have the advantage of coming from a big company so little to nobody knew who they were. Having 2\u20133 comebacks a year, they struggled greatly up until 2015 where their single \u201cI need u\u201d came out,which gave them their first ever music show win, 2 years after debut in comparison to BLACKPINK who won their first music show win just 13 days after debut. \u201c I need u\u201d became a hit and increased their popularity majorly. The following year in 2016, \u201cFire\u201d and \u201cBlood, sweat and tears\u201d were released which became even more popular. \u201cBlood, sweat and tears\u201d along with the album \u201cWings\u201d gave them their first ever daesang for \u201cAlbum of the year\u201d. This was a BIG DEAL, as it was incredibly rare for a group outside of the \u201cbig three\u201d agencies to win a daesang. BTS literally just stepped out of their unknown agencies and won over acts such as EXO (who are often called the nation's boy group). In 2017, \u201cSpring day\u201d and \u201cnot today\u2019 were released. \u201cSpring day\u201d did implecibly on the charts and is still trending on naver charts today (it's been 2 years\u2026). The same year BTS became the first artist to beat Justin beiber at the billboard music awards for best social artist. This would be the start to their legendary success,as everyone not only in Korea but around the world would be saying their name. As the years went by, they would soon become the highest selling Korean artist, highest charting Korean artist on billboard, some of the most influencial people in the world and would have one of the highest grossing concerts of all time and take over musical legends \u201c the Beatles\u201d. All these achievements came from the hard work of 7 men, who had left their tiny towns at young ages to pursue their musical dreams. Bighit didn't create BTS, BTS created Bighit. I still remember when they could barely afford to eat full meals or live in spacious or even tolerable dorms. Now they are the biggest stars in the world. They are BTS. So,to answer your question; yes BLACKPINK are incredibly hard working and talented. But, when you put them next to artists such as BTS they are very overrated. Let's send our love to both groups\u2764   ",

            "answer_text": "I want to ask a question, does YG actually have something to do with whether or not Blackpink is overrated? Although I do agree that Blackpink is more overrated than BTS, YG doesn\u2019t necessarily contribute to that opinion. Everyone who answered has talked about Blackpink being born on a silver plate, but that doesn\u2019t downplay their hard work. Blackpink is a group, a K-pop group at that, who worked and trained hard to be where they are. So, in my answer I am going to refrain from talking about YG too much. (Blackpink did come from a world of fame, but they wouldn\u2019t have debuted if they hadn\u2019t worked hard for it.) It\u2019s hard to compare two very different successful groups, who only have a handful in common. Experience. Not a lot of answers to this question touches on this area, and this is a very important area. BTS has more experience in performing, touring, interviewing, etc. But, they had more time to be popular, so it only makes sense that they become famous now. But Blackpink? They debuted three years ago, with barely any experience, and they\u2019re famous already. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. The experience factor allows BTS to build upon their skills on stage and in real life. We see that Blackpink does not have this factor, and is more inexperienced on stage and irl. But either way, we see that fans are calling Blackpink the best and queens of the industry, when they barely have any experience. Talent. It\u2019s pretty obvious to see that BTS is more talented than Blackpink. Both are talented groups, but when we compare, it\u2019s almost embarrassing to see Blackpink. The dance line in BTS is stronger than Blackpink\u2019s. The vocals in BTS are more pleasing to listen to than Blackpink. The rap? When BTS has one of the best rap lines in the industry, it\u2019s hard to compare Blackpink\u2019s rap to theirs. In terms of stage performance, BTS practically destroys Blackpink. BTS manages to do hardcore choreo, yet keep a stable voice most of the time. We can see their hard work and practice in every single one of their performances. Blackpink, however, does not have the stability. Their stage performance is weak compared to BTS. Their choreography is much easier than BTS, yet they struggle to keep a stable and strong voice. Stage Presence. When we watch the two groups perform together, our eyes are more intrigued by which one? Most likely BTS. BTS has a much stronger stage presence than Blackpink. BTS\u2019s facial expressions, strong and coordinated movements, their voices, and overall performance are much more stronger than Blackpink\u2019s. BTS\u2019s faces contort to their music, their movements are never ever bland, and their voices pack up so much emotion. More people would be intrigued by BTS. Blackpink just dances and sing on stage. They don\u2019t perform like BTS does. They do interact with their fans, but they don\u2019t carry around the same strength BTS does. Music. BTS has the stronger hand in this category as well. They have a stronger variety, and their songs could be made for everybody. They have rap songs, ballads, just pop songs, dance music and more. It helps that they have more than eight times the number of songs Blackpink does. Blackpink is commonly hated on the fact that they have so few songs. It isn\u2019t their fault, this is the only factor that YG plays. YG does not allow Blackpink to write their own songs, and they only write a small amount of songs for this girl group. But either way, BTS beats Blackpink in this category. Character. So many people fall in love with BTS because of personality. They started out scared of being themselves, but as they became more acquainted with the industry, they started to come out more. ARMYs see the real side of BTS, how hard they work, but they see how much these seven boys love them. They aren\u2019t afraid of showing themselves and their love to us. This is different from Blackpink. Blackpink\u2019s personality seems more, not boring, but more controlled. Less expressive. All in all, BTS has more reasons to be where they are. Blackpink kind of showed up out of nowhere and got famous. BTS went through a journey, nearly five years without much recognition, and now that they made it, it hurts to see that people are still calling them overrated. (I just realized how contradictory I was in this answer, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s 3 in the morning-) ",
