When talking on the phone, Viber remains \"Online\". ",

My Viber is running in the background (it is there when I check Apps->Running) but I don't receive any messages until I manually open the app. This is really annoying and I can't find a way to deal with it.  Jordan Arnett, do you happen to have any advise that might work for me? I tried autostart manager, locking apps etc. but absolutely nothing works. The phone is Xiaomi HM 1S running on Android 4.4.4 and MIUI version 6.6.1.0. I would very grateful if anyone can help! Thanks! ",
