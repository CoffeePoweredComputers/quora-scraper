            "answer_text": "Before I was born AND when I was young (I'm 51) we (African Americans) called talking to someone as rappin to them. Instead of saying \u201cGoodbye\u201d (like white folks would say) we would say \u201cahh ite bro\u2026. I'll rap to you later\u201d meaning I'll talk with you again when I see you again. Not just blacks but the Brown (Mexicans) had our own language to separate ourselves from \u201cThe man\u201d (our oppressor) IF the white man called a cigarette a circle we start calling them \u201cSquares\u201d which my generation changed it to \u201cSqahhs\u201d. I'll explain the difference in the short A sound to the dragged out short A sound. It's actually a lil piece of our southern roots coming out as a new northern/southern accent. Long story short. The word \u201cRap\u201d or \u201cRappin(g)\u201d is just street slang for \u201cTalking \u201d to someone. Now\u2026 the first \u201cRap\u201d song to ever hit the radio was a joint called \u201cRapper\u2019s Delite\u201d by a group called the Sugar Hill Gang. Check it out when you get a chance its on YouTube. Rappers Delire came out in 1979 but black artists were rappin long before that. Check out James Brown and/or Isaac Hayes etc\u2026 The next time you are talkin to someone\u2026. Remember that you are Rappin to them my young friend. (Insert smiley face here) ",

            "answer_text": "At first answer, rock comes from Rock and Roll...which is a reference to sex.....  To Asker:  FIRST, Hip Hop is a genre of music, Rap is a verb. People rap, the music that they make is Hip Hop. THEY ARE NOT TWO GENRES! A Rapper Raps, just like a Singer Sings. Do you call the music a singer makes Sing? Is it the genre of Sing? No it's not....neither is there a genre of Rap.  Second, One theory of where the word \"Rap\" came from is that it formed  from the genre \"Rapso\" in Jamaica. It was a genre contemporary with  Reggae and Calypso. It was characterized with being predominately  spoken-word instead of actually singing, also much of it rhymed. During  the period of great immigration from Jamaica to the United States, the  genre of \"Rapso\" followed, and eventually lost the suffix \"-so\" and  became the Verb \"Rap\". Hope I'm not wrong.
