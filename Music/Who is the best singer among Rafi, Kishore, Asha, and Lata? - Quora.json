            "answer_text": "All four are and were legend singers. Everybody has ups and downs. It depends what kind of songs you like? 50s and 60s songs I would go for Rafi and Lata. 70s and 80s I would go for kishore and asha. Note when Rafi carreer was reviving in late 70s, he passed away. Rafi was soft spoken, sang with heart not for money. He helped many new music directors by singing their songs for free. He even agreed to sing for unknown actors of film Dosti music by Laxmikant Pyarelal, when other singers refused to sing for this new actors. All song of DOSTI became instant hit and music director LP became very famous. Rafi and Kishore were very good friends. It was media which created unnecessary conflict of views. A singer is only good as the song composed by music directors. Rafi had special voice for Shammi Kapoor, Kishore kumar sang differently for Dev Anand and Rajesh Khanna. That is their versatilities. Even crores of words for Rafi are not enough. ",
