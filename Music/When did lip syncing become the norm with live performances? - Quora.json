            "answer_text": "I feel like it became a norm in live performances when dancing started to become a big part of the performances. Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, J-Lo\u2026.they gave high energy performances starting in the late 80s, and fans flocked to the performance to watch those iconic dance moves. I remember Janet\u2019s Rhythm Nation tour, one of the first I went to where everyone came to see her dance. We didn\u2019t care that she pre-recorded parts of her performance, especially if she was dancing during them.  Anyone remember the iconic move at 2:44 of her #1 hit \u201cIf\u201d?  I think that lip sync performances started to get a bad rap when technical malfunctions outed the singer as not singing live. Hello J-Lo - although she recovered because of the dancing in the rest of the performance. My feeling on the lip syncing, if you are just a flat out singer, then sing live. If you are a dancer, then bring the energy and the dance moves to the stage, because that\u2019s really what people come to see. I think some people just aren\u2019t good live singers, so they may pre-record some parts. Taylor Swift does pre-record some of her vocals, but she should have done it on these high note fails:  Get the point?\u2026Good\u2026Let\u2019s Dance  ",

            "answer_text": "Lip sync-ing has been around for a long time! Look at any footage from old TV shows from the 60\u2019s such as the Ed Sullivan show. They\u2019ll have someone like Cass Elliot or Streisand come on stage and belt out some mega hit. Do you see any microphones or cables? NOPE! Wireless lavalier mic\u2019s had not been invented at that time. Back then doing audio was way more fraught than it is nowadays. There was tons of heavy gear and dials and twiddlers etc. Since those stages are pretty small and some of those shows were filmed with a live audience, they didn\u2019t have time/space to do a complete stage setup for each act that was going to go on those shows and sing maybe two songs. So how do you think they did it? They Lip Sync-ed!!!! As time rolled on, fans demanded live performances out of their idols. There is an undefinable energy about performing live. When the show is for just one band it was possible to get the setup right, so the people could and did sing live. But that was back when it was about the MUSIC. Nowadays it is more about the spectacle aspect of a show. Singing lives assumes that they can actually sing in the first place. In the past that might have been a fair assumption, but not any more. Some very popular performers these days are all eye candy, and their albums have tweaked their vocals in studio so much that it\u2019s hardly even them. Such performers CAN\u2019T sing live because they would sound like crap. It is impossible even with auto tune an all the rest of it to do live what can be done in studio. So those people ALWAYS lip sync to a vocal that is them but only technically. Then of course there\u2019s the issue of vocal stress. Touring is harsh physically and it takes its toll on the voice. After singing 4 huge shows a week for 3 months, the singer would rather not give her fans a less than optimal voice, so Lip Sync it and problem solved. Finally, even for performers who CAN SING and who aren\u2019t WORN OUT\u2026. fans want MORE! Not only do they want the performers to sing, but they have to DANCE too. And we\u2019re not talking just swaying the hips and snapping the fingers. We are talking a rather athletic choreographed routine with lots of moving around on the stage and strenuous jumps and kicks. Doing all that while holding a mic and trying to see where you\u2019re going with crazy stage lighting back in the day was a recipe for cable tangle, injuries, and other nightmares, not to mention that people do not do their best singing when engaging in strenuous dance moves. Wireless mic\u2019s have solved the cable tangle issue, but we still have people who can\u2019t sing anyway, people with stressed voices, and people who would rather dance live and sync to an awesome vocal performance that they did previously while not being distracted by dancing.
