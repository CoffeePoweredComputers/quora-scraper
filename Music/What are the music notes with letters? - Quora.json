            "answer_text": "C D E F G A B Any of these half a note higher are called sharps, half a note lower are called flats. On a piano or guitar, there's no tonal difference between flat or sharp: an F sharp for example is the exact same note as a G flat. The symbol for sharp is #, and the symbol for flat can be best described as a small lower case b. On fretless stringed instruments (violin, viola, cello, double bass) there is a slight difference between flats and sharps, but those differences are subtle.   ",
