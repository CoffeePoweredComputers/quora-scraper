            "answer_text": "No. You might be confused with the rumour that John Lennon and Beatles manager Brian Epstein (who was definitely gay) had a homosexual affair early in the Beatles' career. Brian and John went on a holiday alone together to Spain and while John has spoken about the trip and denied there was any sexual activity, rumours have persisted for years. There has even been a movie produced that dramatizes the holiday and includes a fictionalised account of homoerotic interaction. The Hours and Times. John once beat up a friend who teased him about this holiday, it was a touchy subject. To the best of my knowledge there has never been any accusation that Paul was gay. Dead, yes, but gay, no.  If he is a homosexual then he's managed to do the best diversion of any gay man in history. 50 years in the public eye, marriages, relationships, children- he's covered his true sexuality incredibly well.

            "answer_text": "No, he and John Lennon were not gay! However, they were definitely bi for each other though. That is a fact. They both shared a wanker or two, other than that, that\u2019s just about it. Doesn\u2019t really matter now though because they were: Two of the most heterosexual men ever known in modern times. I include John in this answer as if asking the same question pertaining to him just as much; which was already asked and most of the answers that asked if John was gay were wrong. So why are all of the answers about Paul being gay not wrong? It is surprising to say the least that a question such as this should be asked. McCartney was no better. There must have been a smidgen of a chance he was, he was the cute one and some gay men may have found him just as arousing, but who are we to know? Nor are we to care as well. Furthermore, a shallow question deserves a shallow answer. There you have it. ",
