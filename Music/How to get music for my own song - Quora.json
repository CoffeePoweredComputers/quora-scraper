            "answer_text": "I did not understand your question perfectly. So I will answer the best way I can. By your song you mean, you have lyrics or you have a melody. So if you have lyrics, then you will have to find a melody that suits your lyrics. If you know any instruments, you can try different chord progressions and eventually you will stumble upon something (I had a friend who did that and wrote brilliant songs). If you have a melody in your head and you have to put it on an instrument. In that case, either use professional musicians or session artists, who can play things easily by ear. Or else, they will give you something very close to what you hear in your head. If you play an instrument and you have a melody. Try to play a few chords or notes, and see which note suits the best to your melody. If you have a chord progression or a musical riff/lick and you want to write lyrics to complete the song. Then you can either take help from a lyricist/songwriter. And if you intend to do it on your own, then probably try to think about an idea or theme, which will correspond your song the best. Once that is decided, you will get better lyrical ideas. If nothing else works, read and read and read (lyrics, poetry, books). Feed your Head. This always helps!! I hope this answers your question. Thanks for A2A. ",
