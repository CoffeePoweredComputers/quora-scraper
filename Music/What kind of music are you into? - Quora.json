            "answer_text": "I\u2019m more eclectic when it comes to music. I grew up with my mom as a music teacher (she was strict as to what type of music should I listen especially while studying - Classical.  And she was the one who made me appreciate and love Philippine tribal music and Asian music). When I was in high school (early 2000s), my classmates were into rock, punk, alternative, etc.   So I had to divide myself (haha) to be in both worlds: appreciating the old school and the musical trend that time. Then in college, I was more into reggae and old school rock and roll. Or rock bands from 80s backwards.    But during the nights, I was into the OPM (Original Pilipino Music). Sample of OPM (English language): Journey by Lea Salonga This was very popular as a graduation song back then hehehe.  OPM (Tagalog language): Himig ng Pag-ibig by Asin (lit. translation Melody of Love by Salt haha)  I like folk and country hits too (international and local). Oh! and Tunog Kalye (OPM street music) especially from the \u201890s never gets old. Sample of Tunog Kalye from the \u201890s: (it can be in English or Tagalog or both) 214 by Rivermaya (English song)  With a Smile by Eraserheads (English song)  Esem by Yano (Tagalog Song)  Don\u2019t Touch my Birdy by Parokya ni Edgar (Tagalog-English)  In 2011 or so, my female co-worker introduced me to Mr. Bones and The Boneyard Circus   I also support the Visayan pop music (which showcase the talents from Visayas and Mindanao and using the Bisaya language - - not Tagalog). Sample of Tagalog Pop: Dahil Sayo by Inigo Pascual  And sample of VisPop (Visayan particularly Cebuano language): Balay ni Mayang (Written by Kyle Wong and Marianne DungogPerformed by Martina Sandiego and Kyle Wong)  I also listen to gospel music (from the hymns up to the Christian rock to the Christian reggae). Oh, the Gregorian chants (and other Orthodoxy chants) give me thrills from time to time. Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing - Covered by Sarah No\u00eblle  Gregorian chant - Deum verum  Russian orthodox angelic song  But as of the moment (thanks to my anxiety haha), I listen to Ancient Chinese music - - it\u2019s more relaxing. It\u2019s a sort of a lullaby so I can sleep peacefully. Beautiful Chinese Music - Bamboo Flute  Hahaha, I just realized that I\u2019m not yet half-way through\u2026but anyway\u2026as long as I am in a mood then I don\u2019t shy away from exploring different genre (even if I don\u2019t understand the lyrics, language and even if they belong to the oldest school such as this one\u2026)  ",

My music listening began in the 1950s, so jazz, Broadway, doo-wop, RnB, Beatles, Hollywood musicals and theme songs, blues, Motown/Stax, rock, funk, some classical, Brazilian, Arabic, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Ray Charles. I have over 17,000 songs in my listening catalog, and I\u2019m about a third of the way through my recordings ( and I\u2019m not counting my performances). I\u2019ll just say I\u2019m into music\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I mostly listen to metal and rap. I'm not one of those people who \u201clistens to everything\u201d because that'd be a bold faced lie. My favorite genre of all time though is nu metal and I know I'll get shit for that lmao. It's just something about the rawness and aggression that can't be matched to me. I also like other forms of metal, rock, EDM, and reggae, but nu metal is just the tits. I usually don't listen to my music around other people because I get judged and made fun of for it. 1. Because they think it sounds horrible and 2. Because I'm black and \u201cblack people don't listen to that bullshit\u201d, so I just say fuck it and not listen to it at all around my friends and family because I don't feel like hearing their mouths ",
