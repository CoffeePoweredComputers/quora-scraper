            "answer_text": "Yes, it is. It is okay to like something that you like, even if there are people who think that your music taste is bad. Well, maybe you don't like indie alternative music or classic rock who some people think are good music. But that doesn't define whether your music taste is okay or not. People's music taste are different, and if you feel crappy about liking modern music, you'll be surprised when you find out there are so many people who have the same taste as you. ",
