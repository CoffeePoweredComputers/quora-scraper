            "answer_text": "Since you're asking about sync, here's a simple \u201cmusic video recipe\u201d which will make sync issues simpler, help the video hang together, and lets you decide how to edit later. Plan shots you'd like to use, e.g. singer in candlelight, couple walking through night forest, couple in front of lake etc. ( video shot while recording of the song and video of a rehearsal or concert performance of the song could be really useful, we\u2019ll get to them later. ) Make an audio version of the song with a count-off, two-pop or other clear audio for syncing t. This will also help your video performers start the song in sync. On shooting days, bring a music playing device with speakers eg. old-school portable CD player. Light the shot, set up camera(s) etc. Play the song. Have the singer (or whoever you\u2019re shooting) lip-sync to the song and/or move in the tempo of the song, play their character connected to the song lyrics and mood. Whomever you film, have them do it while listening to the song. For editing simplicity later, you could have them do it through the entire song every time. Record audio with the camera each time you film. As \u201einsurance\u201c, you could shoot additional informal footage between set-ups, or in the car on the way to the shoot... Imagine that you\u2019ve done twelve different set-ups, and have twelve takes. Now load them all into your video editing software. Lay them out so that each shot has a video track and an audio track. Using the countoff or two-pop waveforms, line them all up so that all clips are in sync. Now get to know your footage. Watch each shot through and take notes or get impressions. This will make everything go faster and better later. Your notes might look like this: couple walking in forest: good up to 1:52, jittery after. singer in candlelight: All usable except bad lip-syncing in bridge. 2 takes; second is better throughout than the first. couple in front of lake: all usable, a bit dark throughout. Then start editing. go from beginning, edit between shots as needed/wanted. Leave all shots in place at first, so whatever you use for the first chorus came from the first chorus. As it begins to take shape, you might begin to move things around. Try to do a first assembly using just your twelve shots from your shooting days. That way the video will have more continuity than if you bring in many shots from the beginning. When you get pretty far along, check out your edit and see if you need \u201esomething more\u201c. In this case, start going to other footage: the informal \u201einsurance\u201c footage you shot, perhaps something from a concert (so not in sync with the recording), footage during the recording of the song, a band interview, stills. You can also get more mileage from your footage by flipping shots horizontally, re-coloring, zooming and cropping, other video effects. Try not to go overboard with your \"something more\u201c - it\u2019s easy to put in more time fussing with 20 seconds than you did with the other three minutes. You asked about Julia Nunes\u2019 videos.  The footage for \"If I Ain\u2019t Got You\u201c was shot as she recorded the song. (because the sync looks too good to be lip-syncing.) She has headphones on after the first take, so she can sing backgrounds and play percussion in time with the basic guitar+vocal recording. At 1:12-1:20 there are jump cuts as she sings background vocals. Julia re-positioned the camera as she sang each of the harmonies so that the video could have a little more movement - good idea! She certainly could have used the \"music video recipe\u201c: lining up all the takes and then beginning to edit.  \u201cDebt\u201d uses the same recipe, as do her other DIY videos I saw. \"Make Out\u201c is trickier.  Much of the footage is slow-motion. Even planning to edit that way, it can still be helpful to film with the song playing so that something of the mood of the song filters into the performances, although they\u2019ll no longer be in sync with the recording when used in slow-motion. Julia\u2019s shots at 0:30, 0:55 etc. are also slo-mo shots - but her mouth movement is in sync with the song. She might have specifically made a faster click track or a time-compressed version of the song and lip-synced to it to get that cool effect. \"I Don\u2019t Want To\u201c uses the same trick - slow-motion yet in sync.  Ms. Nunes is a good video performer and portrays a character well. Don\u2019t forget, good music and a talented cast are also important for music video! Pomplamoose is another group that films while recording and layers the shots creatively:  Hope this helps. Have fun :-) ",

            "answer_text": "You don't *have* to use a great NLE program to create a video that you showed. You may have to spend some time learning to lipsync to the music that you will be singing to before you record your final edit but it can be accomplished without too much fuss.Another creative way to make your own video would be to record yourself multiple time singing and playing different instruments that appear in the song and then splice that together as one video cutting from scene to scene. To create a video like that may require a bit more knowledge or a better NLE (Non Linear Editing) program along with a plugin such as Pluraleyes (http://www.singularsoftware.com/pluraleyes.html) but it would be fun to try. Just remember to give credit to the original author and performer of the music. It's the right thing to do. ",
