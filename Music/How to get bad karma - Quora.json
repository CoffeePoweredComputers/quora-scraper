            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d karma. However, a karma that results in lesser chaotic outcome can be called a \u201cgood karma\u201d and a karma that results in higher chaotic outcome can be called a \u201cbad karma\u201d. If you compare your daily works as a student or a job holder you will notice that a good karma is nothing more than a step towards an organized goal (good result, better performance, etc.) An organized goal is less chaotic state compared to an unorganized goal. For example: if you don\u2019t follow an organized steps to get a set of work done you may end up taking more time in completing the work. Not following an organized method is like working in a chaotic pattern. A chaotic pattern may not lead to completion of a work. When a criminal commits a crime, he/she creates a chaotic effect in society which affects the entire society. The society then brings the criminal to justice only if the society as a whole considers that particular karma as a crime. For example: In a terror-breeding society, it is not a crime for a member of a terrorist organization to kill people. A society that doesn\u2019t see the activity of a terrorist as a crime is a society which considers the karma of the terrorist as a less chaotic karma and as a good karma towards its existence. Such society as a whole does highly chaotic karma or bad karma towards the societies that are liberal, open minded and that are less chaotic. If we consider all the societies in our planet, we can identify the karma of the entire human race. We can see the envelope of the karma of our species and also get a hint of its direction; as in what will be our condition in next 100 years or where we are heading. You can now understand why a crime may go un-punished while a good karma may go un-rewarded. It all depends on the \u2018degree of chaos\u2019 involved in a karma and what is the envelope of the karma of the group or society to which one belong to. Karma can never be void of chaos. Like a flutter of the wings of a butterfly may be a cause of a destructive tornado; a karma that gives life to someone may bring death to many. It is the direction or the envelop of the karma performed by all the individuals that is important. For more, you may read my blog: Space Post Or, this answer on Karma: What is karma? ",

Living only for the satisfaction of the senses, such a person lives in vain.Purport: The mammonist philosophy of \u201cwork very hard and enjoy sense grati\ufb01cation\u201d is condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yaj\u00f1as is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature\u2019s law, this human form of life is speci\ufb01cally meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways \u2013 namely karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yaj\u00f1as for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense grati\ufb01cation require puri\ufb01cation by the above-mentioned cycle of yaj\u00f1a performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The yaj\u00f1a system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-grati\ufb01catory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the yaj\u00f1as are directly aimed at the particular demigods mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yaj\u00f1as one is sure to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. But if by performing yaj\u00f1as one does not become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. ",
