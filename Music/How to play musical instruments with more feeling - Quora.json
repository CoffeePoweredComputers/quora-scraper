            "answer_text": "First, you hear the music in your mind, and you hear it with feeling. Listen to it in your mind, and imagine how it sounds with feeling. Then, practice playing it the way you hear it in your mind. Feeling is communicated by subtle changes in the tempo and loudness of the notes. Doing it well should be done with feeling rather than intellect, and that\u2019s why you need to hear it with feeling in your mind. However, when you are getting started with this, it\u2019s fine to analyze it and decide where you want notes to be louder or softer, faster or slower. Listen to recordings of music you like that are played with feeling. Pay attention to subtle changes of loudness, tempo, and tone. Practice playing those songs with those changes. As you gain experience with this, it will be easier to naturally put more feeling into your playing. Start by simply accenting some notes that you think should be louder. Just this simple approach makes your playing more interesting and enjoyable. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm, that is one of the hardest things to convey to a student. But here are three points I think are worth mentioning. First of all, you need to feel a connection between your emotions and the music you play, so that you feel that your instrument can be an extension of your ability to communicate. Secondly, think of music as an analogy to sentence structure and verbal communication, spoken or sung. How do we talk when we are full of emotion? Do we emphasize words or phrases? Do we speak louder or softer to get our point across? Do our words ever sound even a little bit distorted? Do we change the speed at which we talk (or yell or cry, etc\u2026?) Think about words for your phrase, if each note had a word of a sentence that describes your feelings about the music, how would you say it? Then can you play it that way? Finally, though there are many elements to being expressive musically, I think one of the most important is timing, or placement of notes within a particular phrase. To play things in perfect time as if you are playing to a metronome is rarely anyone\u2019s idea of playing with feeling! So take liberties, make the music your own. If it is your own, you have the right to play it exactly how you feel it. If it is someone else\u2019s, you still have that right; you should add that touch of you that no one else can bring to this piece of music. One last bit of advice is to not be afraid to overdo at first. It\u2019s a better mistake than under-doing. Take risks, take chances, record yourself, see how it sounds compared to how you feel. Often we think we\u2019re doing way more than we are, and the younger we are, often, the less permission we give ourselves to be expressive. It makes us vulnerable. But the best things in life do! PS. The answer below is funny, and it actually happened to me too; in my instance the teacher giving me this advice wanted to be part of that process\u2026but it\u2019s a bunch of sexist BS. ",
