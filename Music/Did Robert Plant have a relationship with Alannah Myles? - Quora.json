            "answer_text": "Well it really doesn't seem to be any kind of a secret that Alannah Myles dated music arranger Robert Plant back in 1990. And while not quite admitting anything about a love affair, Robert Plant finally said about Alannah Myles that, they're good friends and that he thinks the world of her. That she's a great, powerful lady, has one of the finest voicest of the idiom. And that she was always very kind to him as well as very warm-hearted... also stating, \"But the road is the road\". There\u2019ve been rumors that Alannah Myles was his muse of \u201c29 Palms\u201d as she was Plant\u2019s former backing singer and vocalist for the recording of his number one hit song \u201cBlack Velvet.\u201d Plant has actually admitted not only that \u201c29 Palms\u201d was written on tour, at the time they were in California\u201d but he's also confessed that his song was, his \"ideal-love-affair-gone-wrong song\". So while there's no real proof one way or the other, there is Robert\u2019s beautiful love gone wrong song. ",
