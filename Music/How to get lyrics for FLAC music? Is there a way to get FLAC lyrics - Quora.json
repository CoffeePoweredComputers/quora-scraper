            "answer_text": "FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3, but lossless as there is no degradation of sound quality during compression. The type of file does not dictate the lyrics in any way.  Most songs are in MP3 format but I repeat, the song format has zero to do with the song itself or the lyrics. The song is still the same song regardless of how it was formatted. Hope this helps. ",
