            "answer_text": "To learn music, as you say, would involve learning harmony, and the sax is not the best place to start, unfortunately. Depending on how you feel about the instruments, I recommend either keyboard or guitar. To play any instrument well is not easy. You have to find one that feels right to you, but the ones I mention are a good window into the world of harmony.  (Also, you can't sing with a mouthpiece in your face, but maybe that's another issue.)   Guitar is pretty cool.  You don't have to worry so much about the sound like on sax - it takes a lot of work to get the sound right.  You can hang out with other players on a guitar and share and learn together. Sax players often feel quite left out. Then, after you get it together a bit, you could pick up a horn and see what you can do. ",
