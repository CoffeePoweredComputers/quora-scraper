            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve tried Legere, Daddario, and Vandoren and keep coming back to Vandoren, so that\u2019s my personal favorite. I play on 4 1/2 strength Rue Lepic (black box) reeds, but that depends on a lot of things- how big you are (physically), the mouthpiece you play on, so the strength is really something a player needs to figure out for themselves. However, each reed brand has its strengths and some Daddarios might go better with certain mouthpieces. It matters only if you find the best reed for your mouthpiece, and there is a whole lot of variance there. It takes a lot of experimenting and will continue that way until you find the mouthpiece of your dreams. If you are looking to start, then a 2 1/2\u20133 strength blue box Vandoren or Daddario reserve is the choice for you. That is pretty standard. ",
