Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards the treesBehind a bush he lift his kilt and gawks at what he seesAnd in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes\"Ah, lad I don't know you've been but I see you won first prize.\" Ring-ding-did-a-little-la-di-oh, Ring-di-diddly-eye-oh,\"Ah, lad I don't know you've been but I see you won first prize.\" ",
