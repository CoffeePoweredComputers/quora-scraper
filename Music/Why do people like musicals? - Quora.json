            "answer_text": "Musicals represent a heightened, magical world which is not like our realistic world that we live from day to day. Therefore, experiencing a musical is an escape into a different, more interesting, more sonically beautiful place. Musicals are best viewed in the theater. They tend not to work as well in film - because our expectation of film is that it is a more realistic expression. Musicals require a certain amount of freedom to imagine worlds which are unlike our own. They inhabit a world of heightened passions and heightened emotions where people are thrust into song by the events of the play. This freedom gives musicals some wonderful advantages over other forms of storytelling. First, song itself allows for a more emotional exploration of the character\u2019s inner feelings. That\u2019s why shows like Spring Awakening can be set in Germany of 1890, but then use modern Rock music to communicate the inner thoughts of the high-school students in the play. Second, the song in a musical is like a close-up in a movie. When you get a movie close-up, you see small emotional changes in the actor\u2019s face, and these communicate emotion. On stage, there is no such thing as a close up. The audience sees an actor on stage who is, you know, hundreds of feet away. How do you do a close-up? Well, a song is a fantastic way to do a close-up on stage. They sing their emotions and you get a close-up view of what the character is feeling - through music - which you would be unable to get in the same way as a movie close-up. And because it is a musical, you accept that they can sing about their feelings (because that\u2019s what songs are - they are people singing about emotions). A couple of awesome examples are \u2018And I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u2019 in Dreamgirls, and Billy\u2019s \u2018Soliloquy\u2019 from Carousel. And finally, musicals are amazing at expressing \u2018the will of the community\u2019. How can a work of art express the feeling of a group of people? It is really hard. Musicals accomplish this by having actors singing as a group (a chorus). This gives voice to the community in such a powerful way that is practically impossible in any other medium. As an example, watch \u2018The Music Man\u2019 (the songs \u2018Iowa Stubborn\u2019 and \u2018(Ya Got) Trouble\u2019). I\u2019m not sure that any of this description will help you enjoy musicals. I used to have a friend who hated Star Wars because \u2018It\u2019s not realistic\u2019. All art work, to some extent, requires you to relax a bit and enter the world being presented to you. This is one reason why I believe that modern movie-musicals generally do not work. The social contract between the musical and the audience (which is born of the theater experience) is different than the social contract between a movie and the audience. To enjoy a musical, you must agree to enter this heightened, emotional sonic world and accept it (temporarily) as \u2018truth\u2019. If you want to try it out, I *strongly* recommend you see it in the theater, live. Musicals work best, by a large margin, in the context of the theater experience. If all you ever do is watch them on TV or in a movie theater, then it is a much tougher sell. Long winded, I know. I hope this was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "I love musicals very much!!Shout out to the Be more chill, Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Heathers, 21 Chump street, Great Comet Of 1812, Miss Saigon, Rent, Kinky boots, Hairspray, In the heights, and Carousel fans!My most favorite musicals tho is Dear Evan Hansen and Be more chill because it is a bit more relatable but anyway, musicals inspire me everyday.Like it\u2019s beyond the songs, dialogues, and characters, even hearing your favorite actor in a musical you like laugh will pretty much give you a good time (Especially for the insanely cool Will Roland, the lord of dank memes)!Musicals make me happy in general, just hearing one of the songs in one of my favorite musicals will get me dancing.I\u2019ll probably move on from my interest in musicals in the future so right now I am just living up to my mega supreme theater fan expectations and also probably find some bootlegs of Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen, Be more chill, and Heathers since I live in Asia and it will take a billion light years for them to come to my country.This is why I strongly disagree to people who say people who love broadway lives in New York.Like I live in the freaking Philippines and here I am in love with broadway!!!Anyway you guys should probably check the musicals I enlisted above because they are lit! (hopefully one day I\u2019ll meet the amazing and cute Mike Faist (ahhhhhh) and the insanely cool Will Roland) (Also I wanna meet the freaking talented George Salazar!!) ",
