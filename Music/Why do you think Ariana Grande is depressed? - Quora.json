            "answer_text": "Well, I don't think its depression that The Great Ariana Grande (you can\u2019t blame me, I am a big fan) have , it is called PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). As the name suggests, it affects a person after the traumatic event. A person have anxiety attacks, panic attacks, etc (basically or in simpler words, the traumatic event never really leaves a person\u2019s mind and sometimes affects a person\u2019s daily activities). Now, the traumatic event for Ariana the legend (ignore my habit, but it is true so, yeah, whatever) was Manchester Terrorist Attack which happened during one of Ari\u2019s concert (Dangerous Woman Tour to specify) in which 22 innocent people were killed ( I remember that I was at my nonna\u2019s house when I first heard the news and I felt very awful, which any person would after any such event) (thank god Ariana was not affected physically , but it did a awful job on her emotional health) on 22nd May 2017. The Ariana then performed another concert for the affected by death of 22 (there was Pharrel Williams, Mac Miller (Ari\u2019s then boyfriend), Victoria Monet (Ari\u2019s best friend), etc to support her. She still cries sometimes while performing one last time (song of My Everything album) and also somewhere over the rainbow. She supports people of LGBTQ sexuality and belives that the love we spread is above all emotions. She has a tatto related to Manchester Terrorist Attack, it is a bee behind her ear. She also wrote a song named breathing ( sweetener album) about anxiety. Recently, she also shared an MRI (I guess) picture showing the affected area from PTSD, which was a major area of her brain. It is best if we give her the love and support she deserves. After all she have done so many good deeds for everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite a number of reasons. Depression because of that dreadful attack at Manchester, passing away of an ex bf due to drug overdose\u2026..could be personal reasons and of course her being controlled by the Illuminati, singing songs like God is a woman\u2026..rich, famous but will always be controlled by the ones who made her rich and famous. She is a wonderful person and a good singer\u2026sadly, the price of fame, always being under the public eye, and selling her soul for a price is just completely overwhelming for someone so young. More of these artists will show a lot of signs of depression in the years to come. I guess we could just pray for them and value their artistry. They made a choice. They have to live with that, sadly. ",
