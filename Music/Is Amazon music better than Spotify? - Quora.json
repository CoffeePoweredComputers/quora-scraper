            "answer_text": "n recent times many of us have changed the way that we listen to music, swapping physical formats such as CDs for streaming services such as Spotify. Instead of \"owning\" music \u2013 whether physical or digital \u2013 we now pay a monthly subscription fee to access music in the cloud, allowing us to listen to millions of songs \u2013 without actually buying them. Unsurprisingly, the popularity of music streaming has rocketed. In fact, music streaming is now the industry\u2019s fastest-growing revenue source with an estimated 68 million people worldwide paying for a music subscription service. Spotify is one of the biggest players in this market, but it's beginning to face stiff competition \u2013 especially now that Amazon has its own rival music streaming service called Amazon Music Unlimited. Can the tech giant knock Spotify off its perch? Let's weight up the pros and cons... Amazon Music Unlimited is Amazon's Apple Music and Spotify rival, while Prime Music is the version of its music app included with an Amazon Prime membership. Amazon Music Unlimited comes with 40 million songs, ad-free, that can be downloaded to listen anywhere. Amazon Prime Music is a service with two million songs, available through an Amazon Prime subscription, which costs \u00a379 per year. You can also get a special Amazon Music Unlimited Echo deal when you buy an Amazon Echo smartspeaker. The exclusive price of \u00a33.99 is only available with the Echo. Amazon also has a brand new free tier to its music service. This version is only available when users play on an Echo smartspeaker, and includes adverts. You cannot search for individual songs, but instead must stick to playlists or radios from Amazon. Amazon Music Unlimited | 60 million songs ad-free\u200e Join For free Amazon Music Unlimited ",
