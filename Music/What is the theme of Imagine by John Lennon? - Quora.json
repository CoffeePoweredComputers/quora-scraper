Obviously a world like that will very likely and very sadly never exist, that's why the song is called \u201cImagine\u201d and he sings about being a \u201cdreamer\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Y\u2019all kinda right. But bruhhhhh, I think the song is more likely to be promoting peace and pacifism. The rise of terrorist attacks, human trafficking, and international conflicts in the 21st century reveals the intensification of the intricacy of power dynamics on an international level. John Lennon, A.K.A the \u201cFather of Peace\u201d, was also a pacifist. In 1967, Lennon started to espouse pacifism in his lyrics; some of them even being adopted as anthems for the anti-war movement. Later on, he held a two-week-long \u201cBed-Ins for Peace\u201d as an anti-war campaign for the Vietnam War. \u201cImagine\u201d was written in 1971, at the climax of Lennon\u2019s Peace Movement. Not only did he continue his Bed-Ins Peace campaign in different places, but he also released singles, which are associated with anti-militarism and world peace, notably \u201cHappy Xmas (War is Over).\u201d In the lyrics, components of pacifism appear in a grandiose and utopian way. \u201cImagine there are no countries\u201d and \u201cNothing to kill or die for\u201d lead fans to fantasize an anarchic world without countries ad pains. It also reveals a realist perspective on the causation of \u201cwars\u201d. Realists argue that the countries are individual actors on a global scale; and are struggling for survival and self-interest. Thus, states are destined to start wars. In the case, \u201ccountries\u201d can also be an analogy of human greediness on a local level. \u201cImagine all the people living life in peace,\u201d and \u201cimagine all the people. Sharing all the world,\u201d also create a harmonious, idealistic picture for listeners. However, this illusory utopia creates an immense contrast to reality. The brutalities, violence, wars, and injustices are then magnified. The chasm between the utopia in \u201cImagine\u201d and reality has proven that \u201cpeace\u201d is the only way out to combat brutality while \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d can never be considered as a measure. Growing up, I\u2019ve always been a big fan of the Lennon gang (shout out to the Beatles xoxo)! His one-of-a-kind thoughts on pacifism, his flamboyant ideal on spreading peace dragged me from being a pessimist to an optimist. \u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer,\u201d but if everybody DOES value peace and eliminate any use of violence?, A peaceful utopia would no longer be just an idea, but a reality!. I know something is happening in my hometown, Hong Kong, at the moment. But PLEASE DON\u2019T USE ANY FORM OF VIOLENCE NO MATTER WHAT! ",
