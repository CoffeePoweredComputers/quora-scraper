            "answer_text": "A lot of times it depends on the song and why you are listening to it. Some song lyrics don\u2019t really have much meaning and are just meant to be catchy bops. Also, some songs do have deep meanings with emotional lyrics but are also catchy enough that it is possible to get caught up in the catchiness and jamming out to the song that you don\u2019t really pay attention to what the lyrics mean. Some people easily remember the lyrics to a song if they are listening to songs with emotional lyrics that are written in a way that can make you actually feel what they are feeling at the time they wrote it. That makes it easier to remember the lyrics, especially if the lyrics actually do relate to something you are feeling or a situation you are going through or went through at some point. Also, if you listen to a song for emotional reasons and really pay attention to the lyrics, you will be more likely to remember them. Also, you will be more likely to have a difficult time remembering lyrics to songs that are in languages you don\u2019t understand. I listen to those kinds of songs sometimes. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people remember lyrics because the song has a special meaning or significance. Others might remember the lyrics because the are simple and/or silly. On average I think most people remember part of the lyrics as they are applied to a certain situation without realizing all of the implication of the rest of the lyrics. For example when I was growing up, the song \u2018Reasons\u2019 by Earth Wind & Fire was popular and young lovers would dedicate it to each other as an expression of their love. The main cause was the lyric that said \u2018The reasons that we're here, the reasons that we fear our feelings won't disappear\u2019. But if you listen closely to the rest of the lyrics you find the song is about a one night stand, not forever love. Some people might remember lyrics because the music is fantastic but the lyrics were surprising. For me an example was the song \u201811 Miles per hour\u2019 by Was Not Was. I used to listen to this while driving and jammed to the beat. Listened specifically for the harmonica solo but didn't listen to the lyrics very closely. Imagine my surprise to discover the song is about the JFK assassination. So it is why you are listening that determines what you remember. ",
