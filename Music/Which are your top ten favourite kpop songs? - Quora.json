            "answer_text": "Top 10? Wow, I only got into the genre about five or six months ago and I can think of 30+ good songs. Nah, just kidding. I have some favorites, so here they are. VIDEOS ARE ON THE BOTTOM!! Yes, they are in order and I\u2019m sorry if I did mostly title tracks with the exception of #3 and #7. I\u2019m also sorry for the long paragraphs of why I like the songs so much. I also gave \u201cwriting prompts\u201d for scenarios I think of when I hear these songs and apologize if the videos are wild/wacky BTW: I don\u2019t speak or understand Korean, so I have been reading English translation of lyrics to interpret the meanings of the songs. Days Gone By (Day6): This was the first Day6 song I listened to. It immediately transports me to a scene from one of those John Hughes films or an 80s high school prom. The song itself talks about nostalgia of an old relationship, but for some reason it makes me happy since it is written in the key of (A# major/C minor). The synths remind me of the dream-pop I listened to before getting into k-pop and the guitars are reminiscent to the indie/new wave music I enjoyed throughout my high school years. Want a song to write a prom scene to? Here it is. (I\u2019ve planned a whole plot scene where the main character in my story recreates this music video in her own way)Look (GOT7): Before hopping on my indie phase in high school, I listened to a lot of radio-friendly EDM music (Calvin Harris being my favorite) and for this reason, this song reminds me of a Calvin Harris song. (PSA: THIS IS THE SONG THAT GOT ME INTO K-POP LOL) The beat is fresh, the lyrics are telling a story of how the speaker has eyes for one person only and that their love interest should keep their eyes on them. I also love the music video, so there\u2019s that. JB is a gifted songwriter and I wish JYP paid attention to this. Want to write/imagine a party scene where two people lay eyes on each other for the first time and dance the night away as they fall in love over the course of the night, only to have a conversation before the party ends? Here\u2019s a song for that.Like (BTS- Some of you may know it as \u201cI Like It\u201d): I have such an eclectic taste in music, so RnB is something I\u2019ve been trying to get myself into lately. This particular song was the first BTS song I liked as I made way into appreciating RnB more. I had heard of one or two of their songs, but I never seriously considered listening to them until I heard this song. It has a groovy bass line (something I like) and a major late 90s/2000s RnB vibe; the vocal line show their highest potential here and the rap line show off their developing talent. (peep at Hoseok\u2019s vocal/melodic rap). It\u2019s a song about how the speaker and his girlfriend broke up and he still miss her as he is jealous that the ex\u2019s new boyfriend likes her photos. I wish they still performed it live. Want a song to write/imagine a scene about missing an ex and how the power of social media can further tempt you into having that temporary stalking your ex session and then realizing how much you miss them? Here ya go.Tempo (EXO): I remember my friend from college telling me how much she liked EXO; back then, I wasn\u2019t into k-pop. However, I had heard of EXO throughout high school and one of the common names that popped out of people\u2019s mouths when it came up was Kai (who looks a lot like a 12 y/o cousin of mine). I didn\u2019t care for/listen to their music until I encountered Tempo (and as a result, I\u2019ve been binge listening to EXO\u2019s music. oh and if y\u2019all care, my bias is Chanyeol). This song perfectly displays the undisputed supremacy of EXO's vocal line (well, Baekhyun, Jongdae, Kyungsoo and Suho. Minseok and Kai sang very little, whereas Yixing was nonexistent, but that\u2019s a story for another time) and the talent of the blossoming rap line (Is it Sechan or Chanhun?). The beat is something very unique in that I had not heard of it in the music that I listened to before. I still don\u2019t know if I should classify this song as a party song either. Anyways, I immediately fell for the acapella section (perfectly executed by Baekhyun, Suho and Kyungsoo. Probably the best choices for this part.) Chanyeol\u2019s rap lines, like his personality, are memorable, which for this song is no exception. I highly recommend this song if you want to write/imagine a scene like #2 (but a bit more physical, but not sexual) or for a dance sequence at a party when everyone is super bored.Fancy (Twice): This song immediately grabbed my attention to the point where I\u2019m about to dethrone \u201cLove Scenario\u201d by IKON as the new South Korean national anthem. It\u2019s so catchy and although I suck at dancing, I somehow know the choreography to the chorus of the song. I like how easily danceable the song is and how catchy/sticking to your head the vocals are. The sound of the song is still the same classic bubblegum pop Twice are known for, but they are signaling some form of change (as shown in the music video, they combine the mature and bubblegum concepts) and I\u2019m down for it. I know the chorus has very memorable choreography and although brief, I enjoyed Chaeyoung and Dahyun\u2019s rap parts. The lyrics speak of an immediate infatuation the speaker has with someone along with the subsequent feelings that come with it (I think this is something we all can relate to). TBH, I\u2019m mad that Tzuyu doesn\u2019t get a lot of lines, but that\u2019s a story for another time. I highly recommend this song when you write/imagine a scenario about seeing a cute person at a public place, such as a beach and being instantly infatuated with them or a scene where everyone miraculously knows the choreo of the song.As If It\u2019s Your Last (Blackpink): A party anthem that reminds me of the classic 2000\u2019s/early 2010s bangers I would listen to (so those David Guetta or to a small extent, Avicii songs we\u2019d hear every other day on the radio). I can\u2019t think of some right now, but I think you know what I mean. It\u2019s my favorite Blackpink song. I like Jisoo and Rose\u2019s vocals here; Lisa\u2019s verses in this song are probably some of her best in their catalogue and Jennie\u2019s parts are strongest here as well. The video is also really cute; they look like they\u2019re living the time of their lives. The beat gives off dance til the end vibes; the synths are reminiscent of 80s music. The lyrics tell how the speaker wants to live this relationship as if it\u2019s their last day (or last one?). Ironically, I like how the song is able to coat this dark message in a sweet, major-key Guetta-esque beat. When you want to write/imagine a party scene where you\u2019re living the time with the love of your life/ a great group of friends and enjoying those moments as if they are your last; I usually think of like an after-party on New Year\u2019s.Coming Home (JJ Project): I\u2019m from New York City, so this song gives me a major urban/contemporary vibe. Jinyoung and Jaebeom make an exceptional duo and I\u2019m glad JY wrote this song. I love how they manage to combine synth-based pop, contemporary beat-making production, soft vocals and modern (not extremely) sensual RnB to make this underappreciated queen. I love the perfect use of the slap bass and of the synth, which gives it the classic urban vibe. The lyrics tell the story of how the speaker goes away for a while and comes home to the love of their life and how no matter where they are, they will come home for them (the lover). Also, the piano at the end gets me. It\u2019s such a sweet and romantic song; the first time I ever listened to this song, I was going to Brooklyn and taking the D train over the Manhattan Bridge and saw the river behind me, hence my connection of the city and this song. It also makes me think of the guy I liked for a while in college. When you want to write/imagine a scene in late-night New York, somewhere in Brooklyn and riding the train back into Manhattan, thinking of the love of your life and no matter where you are, the city will always be your home (along with them).You Are (GOT7): I have a soft spot for GOT7 as they are the first group that I got into. It\u2019s a bit too ballad-y to be called a title track, but I love how positive and beautiful it is. When I am sad or feel hopeless in life, I like to listen to this song and look at the sky; there will be better days out there and this day is just a small pass. The video is strange and lowkey looks like a cult gathering members to connect a necklace, but I love how the setting of the video reminds me of a breezy spring evening. The rap line\u2019s verses showcase a sincere side to them, whereas the vocal line showcase their most admirable (and probably best in their entire catalogue) moments in this song, particularly Jaebeom and Youngjae. The lyrics connotate the speaker\u2019s lover being as beautiful as the sky and the lover being a place of comfort; I love the imagery he uses to describe how much this person means to him. I wish they performed it at the concert, but IDK. I don\u2019t make the setlist lol. Somethig for when you want to write/imagine watching the sunset after a picnic with the love of your life; you guys are having a conversation and you keep looking at the sky and then at them as you begin to realize how much they mean to you and you to them.Daydream (J-Hope): The aesthetics of the video remind me of a Tyler the Creator song; to be honest, this song reminded me of a Tyler the Creator song, period. It has a bouncy bass line, sliding/bouncy rap verses and melodic vocals. Hoseok shows a side to himself in this album that we don\u2019t see in the music he is involved in with BTS; he is more vulnerable and is unafraid to share his experiences/insecurities. While listening to this song and watching this video, I realized that he visualizes the world in a colorful way, which is something I don\u2019t hear/see in most songs these days. He makes references to sleep, Alice in Wonderland and Hogwarts, thinking about an alternative world of impossibilities and peace, something we are all prone to doing. Something for when you want to write/imagine a scene where the main character is having a moment of downfall, but has a montage of various dreams without understanding what they mean; yet, these daydreams help the main character get what they want at the end.Miroh (Stray Kids): This was the first Stray Kids song I ever heard. At first I didn\u2019t like it because it was unusual for a k-pop song to sound like the way it does (it was noisy when I first heard it), but after a couple of listens, it became an instant bop. With high emphasis on production and beats, 3Racha create an underrated festival-worthy classic and if they make a surprise cameo at Coachella and perform this song, I won't be surprised. The lyrics talk about being confused and how life is like a maze (cuz \u201cMiroh\u201d means maze in Korean) that we need to navigate in order to get through it, no matter what it takes and what obstacles come our way. The majority of the members are teenagers and like every human being ever, they are still trying to figure out their lives (albeit most of it is in the spotlight); adolescence and young adulthood are a confusing time as people are just beginning to figure out who they are. I applaud Chris, Han and Changbin for not being afraid to write about these things such as loss of youth, mental health, etc. Something for when you want to write a lit party scene and there\u2019s a small, but very important interaction between some characters and then there\u2019s an improptu dance break where people somehow know all the steps.Days Gone By  Look  Like (or \u201cI Like It\u201d)  Tempo  Fancy  As If It\u2019s Your Last  Coming Home  You Are  Daydream  Miroh  ",
