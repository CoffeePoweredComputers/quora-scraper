            "answer_text": "Bass produce lowest sound of any acoustic instruments except pianos, hence you can feel its deep pronouced tone and power, in case of electric basses. In acoustics, bass need great energy that is why basses have large diameter strings and should be picked with force (in acoustic bass and contra bass) or, otherwise needs powerful amplification (in case of electric basses). People always loved deep bass sounds even non musicians. Thats why consumer electronics on audio industries inovates sub woofers and bass oriented speakers ever since the dawn of modern technology. Every instruments have thier own sound characteristics, saxophone, guitars, organs, and so on. Bass have its own distinctive sound characteristics that really cuts through the mix, because most instruments produce near the midrange spectrum of human hearing, while bass blasts powerful low sound. These sound not only reach your ears, it hits your whole body like some sort of invisible force. Your brain will combine these experiences together and thus tranlates into one feeling. ",

            "answer_text": "One short answer: google harmonic series (overtones). The lower the fundamental pitch played (say, the 30.868 Hz low B on my 5-string bass) the more overtones are produced that you can hear (13 of them before reaching Concert Pitch at 440 Hz \u2013 the midrange note to which an orchestra tunes), producing a fuller and more pleasing sound. This is the sensation of body Dave Hatch referred to above. Think of it as a row of bassists playing one note of the series, each progressively quieter. Low frequencies have a dark side, to be sure. It can be irritatingly muddy (conflicting harmonically with itself or some other overtone series in the arrangement), unsettling (like the rumble of an earthquake or a sitting on the lowest keys of the piano), even unbearably painful and physically damaging due to body resonant frequencies (google it yo) or sound pressure levels (gunshots, explosions, amps that go to 11). David Collins, I wonder if the cause of your bass = meh feelings might be more closely linked to the performer's questionable musicality or the questionable arrangement of the instrument in a composition, and that the bass guitar's frequency range is just an innocently bystanding wave. All that I'm saying is give bass a chance. :-D ",
