My personal interpretation is that they're telling a person that they love them (heart beating) and asking if they love them too. They then ask if the love is real (am I dreaming) and if the feeling will last forever (eternal flame). But hey!? What do I know? Addendum: Okay. Now that I've actually listened to the song, I have to stick with my original interpretation. I agree with myself. It\u2019s about love. ",
