            "answer_text": "Among plenty of options, i found this one is the best. Acer nitro 5. It is gaming series laptop with big fans and accurate harware to meet your needs, with configuration of i5 7gen/8GB/1TB/2GB gtxNvidia. Having said this, if you are using power director for video editing then there might be some problem as power director 14 and above versions will not work on nvidia. They doesnt run on this processor for some reason. But if you work in lower resolution, in live view, it will work perfectly as you can export the video in HD afterwards. Link for the laptop is below and some offer is gng on on this from acer too.
