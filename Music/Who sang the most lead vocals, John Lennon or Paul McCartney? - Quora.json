            "answer_text": "Early in their career (1962\u20131965) John sang most of the lead vocals wth Paul harmonizing well. As their songwriting progressed they mostly sang the lead vocal depending on who authored the song. As John\u2019s output fell from \u201867-\u201970 Paul ended up taking the lead on more songs mainly because he was writing them. One example of the author of a song taking a lead vocal when it suited the other\u2019s voice better would be Oh Darling. It was written by Paul but needed a more gravelly vocal approach. Instead of asking John to sing it Paul wrecked his voice for 5 days before recording the final vocal track. Sure, it is iconic and somewhat amazing it might have had a different outcome had John taken lead. George sang lead vocal on two songs authored for him by John and Paul (Do You Want To Know A Secret and I\u2019m Happy Just To Dance With You) but then took lead on his favorite cover songs and his own compositions as his writing progressed. Ringo had his obligatory vocal spotlight on nearly every album but most were written by John and Paul for Ringo. All three Beatles wrote songs for Ringo to record after their breakup. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeh probably John as he sang significantly more of the early Stuff than Paul but it was about 50/50 from about Rubber Soul in 65 onwards, So overall i'd say roughly 55/45 John overall. EDIT: Having just counted from the wiki page of Beatles songs which includes the lead singer in one of the sections (PHEW!) ....including covers as well as their own material...John sings lead on 137 tracks, Paul sings lead on 103, so it's pretty close: 57/43 to Lennon in fact (so pretty good guess from me) and obviously the other was usually singing backing or harmony on the tracks, and therefore still contributing vocally. Damned if i'm going to go through the list for the George led songs now though (-; ",
