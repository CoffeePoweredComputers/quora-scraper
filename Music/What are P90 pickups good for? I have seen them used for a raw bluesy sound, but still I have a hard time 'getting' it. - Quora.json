            "answer_text": "It\u2019s simply a fuller, rounder, single coil sound - that\u2019s how you \u201cget\u201d it! Your typical single coil is rather harsh, glassy, sometimes really grating if you crank up the tone. However, they provide you with clear, open, and airy tone, which is what makes a good clean tone. On the other hand, humbuckers are really warm, punchy, and beefy, but not as delicate, and it has a rather focused and \u201cspringy\u201d tone. The P-90 gets the best of both worlds. It is a single coil design, so you get that open, clear sound, with crystal clear highs, but you also get the warm, meaty, punchy mids of the humbuckers. Another way to \u201cget\u201d P-90s is to play them in context. Pick up a Fender type guitar with a P-90 on the neck, to a super clean amp. With the right tone knob setting, you will get a super clean neck pup sound that has the resonance and warmth that could come close to an acoustic guitar. On the other hand, a P-90 on the bridge cranked up and into an amp set to crunch or high gain and you will get the tightest, punchiest overdrive/crunch/distortion tone you would ever get from a single coil setup, without the harshness.

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re among my favorite pickups. They\u2019re midrangey and push an amp, but they\u2019re still articulate. Somewhere between a PAF style humbucker and Fender single coil. But for exactly the same reason, lots of players don\u2019t like them. If you\u2019re into 70s rock they won\u2019t be heavy enough. If you\u2019re into glassy clean tone they\u2019ll be too dirty. Check out Grant Green. One of the best tones of all time, and he exclusively played p90 hollowbodies straight into a small tube amp.
