            "answer_text": "Fear of a Blank Planet by the Porcupine Tree. The album cover has haunting vacuous blue eyes set in an equally daunting visage, lit by the omnipresent \u201cblue light\u201d that the album title references as an agent in the overall \u201cblankness\u201d precipitating in the youth. Their excessive attachment to the computer and television screens, indulgence in nihilistic pursuits will eventually ensue in a planet comprising metaphorically \u201cblank\u201d people, a premonition amply echoed in the tracks of the album and the appurtenant music videos. The album title is an apt one, rather than many outrageously named album titles to evoke shock or smirks or those which have no bearing whatsoever to the album content.

First, it is the Who\u2019s next album, second, looking at the cover, who is next to pee on the stone.  I would add \u201cRuber Soul\u201d, by the Beatles  And \u201cBlood on the Tracks\u201d, by Bob Dylan  Honorable mentions, \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d, by the Moody Blues  And \u201cSticky Fingers\u201d by the Rolling Stones  ",
