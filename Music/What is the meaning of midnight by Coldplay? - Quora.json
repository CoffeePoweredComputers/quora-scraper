It urges one to stay hopeful, even in the darkest times, when you are away from home, away from family and friends, when you are caught up in the middle of a crisis, you should leave a light on, implying you should have hope. Everything tragic, all wrong happened to you, would one day be past for you, and you'll move on, the world hasn't ended, you'll rise, and you'll be stronger than before. ",

The darkness before the dawn - despair, when it seems that the night is lasting forever - is very real for a lot of people, and Coldplay reminds us that often the key to their hope is in our hands. We can leave a light on. We can be there for them, and help them find their way home. ",
