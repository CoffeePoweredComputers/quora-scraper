            "answer_text": "Singing along with a tune doubles the pleasure which is elicited by the melody increasing and decreasing then increasing then decreasing the degree of anticipation of harmonious resolution. Why does harmonious resolution and its anticipation give us pleasure? Because we are evolved to discern animal sounds; the instant we hear the sound of any animal we picture its form and determine if it is safe. When we determine the sound means it\u2019s safe we feel the pleasure of relief. Songs are safe sounds so we are pleased by them, or, by the melody which goes up and down both the frequency scale and the harmonious resolution scale. The harmonious resolution scale is the measure of just how consonant or dissonant a pitch interval is; melodies are composed of a series of pitch intervals, the note of the moment in reference to some root note, usually the tonic of the scale. Each pitch interval elicits a certain degree of harmonious resolution / yearning for harmonious resolution. It is the waxing and waning of the yearning for harmonious resolution / feeling harmonious resolution which makes a melody compelling and pleasant. Too much resolution is a boring melody; too much yearning for resolution (induced by dissonant pitch intervals) makes for a difficult song to listen to. The pleasure is in the changes we hear. Singing along doubles that pleasure; this was \u201cproven\u201d by lab experiments on volunteers undergoing fMRI scans while listening and playing music. Playing / singing music is much more pleasurable than just listening, according to volunteer reports and fMRI scans which map the blood flow to brain regions, in this case the pleasure / reward center.

            "answer_text": "I think you could avoid singing along, but you choose to sing because of the joy it gives you. I do the same thing, but I try to spare the people around me because I know they prefer to hear the song without my voice added to it. I think it\u2019s best to do the singalong in private, or with a group of others who like to sing. ",
