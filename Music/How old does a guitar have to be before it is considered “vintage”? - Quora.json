            "answer_text": "Vintage is usually taken as 25 years old, but \u2018vintage\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018valuable vintage\u2019. Twenty-five years takes us back to 1994. By this time there were masses of good quality, affordable guitars, especially electrics. Once Washburn, Aria, Ibanez, Yamaha and others figured out how to make good guitars at reasonable prices which weren\u2019t copies of American guitars, it became a golden age for new purchases. All of these are turning \u2018vintage\u2019 now, but electric guitars don\u2019t get better with time, and a perfectly playable guitar then, with a good sound, will either still be perfectly playable with a good sound, or it will have deteriorated and be worth less. \u2018Vintage\u2019 guitars, in the usual meaning of the term, are rare guitars which are prized for particular qualities. The vintage to all vintages was the 1958\u201360 Les Paul Standard sunburst, of which 1700 were made (and there\u2019s about as many fakes of these knocking around as well). If you can find one, even without any particular history, it will be price of a new Ferrari to buy it. Or, if you find one in the attic, and you can give reasonable evidence as to how it got there, you can start browsing Ferrari catalogues to see which car you want to buy when you sell it. Vintage guitars, like the aforementioned Les Paul, are usually associated with an end of line or a drastic deterioration in production quality after the vintage years. With the Les Paul, it was both: Gibson stopped making them, and, when it started again, it didn\u2019t make them as well. I have a vintage Yamaha 1977 SG-1000. It\u2019s worth quite a lot now in European markets, but the 1982 and onwards models aren\u2019t. They are still fine to play, but a change in production methods and strategy meant that they have more of a mass-produced, good-enough quality to them. The same goes for 1970s Yamaha acoustics, which are quite collectable, whereas 1980s models aren\u2019t. This doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get something for the later SG-2000s (or SBG-2000 in the USA), but there won\u2019t be a premium for it being \u2018vintage\u2019. Some guitars will never be worth anything. I started on a Columbus Les Paul copy. If I still had it, it would go for about half what I paid for it at a junk shop in 1981. The same goes for Kays, Satellites, and many others. You might get something for a Hohner or an Epiphone, but, again, you might not. A vintage Squier is not going to substantially add to your retirement fund. My 1990s Godin is going to be vintage in a couple of years time. It\u2019s a magnificent guitar, but Godin has carried on improving its models constantly since then, so, basically, although it is just as good as when I bought it second-hand in 2006, and I could probably get my money back if I sold it now, it\u2019s never going to really appreciate in value because they\u2019re still making them, and they\u2019re making them better now than then.  Basically, for age to make it worth more, it either has to be collectible (usually on the basis of scarcity) or have some characteristic no longer available which is highly prized. In about twenty years time, a lot of expensive-wood guitars will probably pick up in value.  Generally, values of second-hand guitars, except for those few vintages, have taken a hit because of eBay, Craig\u2019s List and Reverb. Pretty much the whole back catalogue of guitars which were ever made but are no longer played are making their way onto those sites. This substantially lifts saleability\u2014 lots of guitars which no music shop would ever touch will change hands for some money \u2014 but it keeps prices down for instruments that otherwise might have some scarcity value.  If you have an old instrument, enjoy playing it. ",

            "answer_text": "Many factors, age is only one of them. The number produced, and made by a particular luthier also count. Age tends to become a factor, because the older ones were made before CNC routers, and machines making them. One of many \u201cClassic \u201c guitars is the 59 Les Paul, of which there were only 2 to 300 made, by a very few people. So that\u2019s why they become vintage, cause they\u2019re weren\u2019t many made or survived the thefts and thrashing\u2019s of the 60s etc. Modern vintage guitars follow the same vein, Pensa Suhr guitars of New York, are again hand made, have search for Mark Knopflers one that they made for him in the 80s. Hand carved, and shaped to his spec. Priceless in a way. Fender made a one off for George Harrison, called the \u201cRooftop Fender\u201d which he used on the day, and recorded Let it be album. The solo on Let It Be, was played on this guitar. A Rosewood/Maple/Rosewood sandwich body. They released a 25 Year anniversary edition, one of which I have pictured below, that belongs to me. A beautiful instrument in every way. They brought the woman out of retirement, to rewind 25 pickups to the original design. Ebony fingerboard the lot! Rosewood neck, pearl inlays dots. Fender Custom Shop engravings, complete with dings and scrapes. Top hat pickup switch bent on purpose towards the rhythm pickup, cause he kept catching it into other settings? Fine vintage instrument.. one of 26. The original is owned by Daniel Harrison, and unfortunately like many classic guitars, are gawped at in glass cases, when they have many years of playability left in them.
