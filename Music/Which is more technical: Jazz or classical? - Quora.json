            "answer_text": "There is no overall answer to this question. Both genres offer the most simple and the most complex music you can imagine. Which is more technical: Rachmaninoff's 3rd concerto, or Miles Davis' album Kind of Blue? In terms of sheer playability, pretty obviously the latter is a piece of cake compared to the former. Now, which is more technical: Erik Satie's gymnopedies and gnossiennes, or Anthony Braxton's album For Alto? Children under ten years old can learn to play moving renditions of the former. The latter took Anthony Braxton many years of training in both physical ability and improvisational maturity. It's true that classical pieces often demand a level of instrumental mastery that goes beyond a typical jazz piece. It's also true that to be a halfway decent jazz player, you need to know everything about playing music that classical players know, and more - you need the ability to get under the surface of a piece, and redesign it to your whims in real time. Technique in the end is not as important as simple musicality, and both types of music require the utmost musicality. One thing I will give jazz is their percussionists typically need a LOT more technique than a classical percussionist. Sorry to all you PhDs in classical drumming out there, but resting for 240 bars and then hitting the downbeat at the right time is not as cool as any five second clip of Jack DeJohnette :) ",

Sure, there is some jazz that is more complex than some classical, and vice versa, but with both genres being so incredibly broad (and with both copying and appropriating so many ideas of one another) it would be impossible to say.
