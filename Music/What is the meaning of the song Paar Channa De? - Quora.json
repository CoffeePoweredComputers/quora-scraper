            "answer_text": "It is a beautiful song about the story of sohni-mahiwal, with spiritual symbolism and sufism as its base. Lets cut short and start at the point where the song begins. After Sohni is married off, Mahiwal has started living like a faqeeer on banks of the river Chenaab (referred as channa, punjabi for chenaab). Sohni's marital house is on the other side of the river. Sohni crosses the river every night to meet Mahiwal and returns before morning. She does that using an earthen pot (she belongs to the potter clan). One day her sister in law replaces her pot with an unbaked one, which dissolves in water and Sohni drowns in water. Then Mahiwal also kills himself. The song starts with sohni telling the pot that mahiwal's hut is across chenaab, the night is dark and river on high waves. In fact, the entire song she is talking to the pot. Later on, pot tells sohni that I am not strong but weak, in fact my nature is weakness. The end of a weak one is weak. One should not expect crossing the river taking support from a weak one. The sohni tells the pot not to be afraid of the high waves in the river, today I will surely meet mahiwal. My corpse would meet the beloved today. Now, just read the above two paragraphs picturing sohni as human soul, pot as the human mind, Mahiwal as true master or God, and river as the life and its ups and downs, happiness and sorrow etc. This song is the conversation of soul with mind. Imagine such refined symbolism is in a folk song whose creator is not known! The last stanza (which I don't like a lot) talks about taking refuge of the true master or murshad, who helps cross this river. ",
