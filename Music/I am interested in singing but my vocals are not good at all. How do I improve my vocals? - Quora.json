            "answer_text": "The best thing you can do, if you can afford the time and money, is to get a private teacher. Find a respectable singing teacher, preferably a classical or opera teacher as they will be able to teach you the best general technique, and study with them. I was amazed at how quickly I improved my singing with just a few lessons with a good coach! If you can\u2019t go that route, then the next best thing is just a lot of practice and trial and error. Try to find some videos on proper breathing technique, as breathing to play a musical instrument or sing is different than how you would breathe day to day. Then start to record yourself singing and listen back to what you could improve on. If you do this, you\u2019ll be tempted to judge yourself harshly, its important that you try to block this out and focus on positive growth. I\u2019m of the opinion that anyone can become a good singer, maybe not world class, but at least good or even very good regardless of their natural voice. Keep at it and you\u2019ll get there if you focus your attention in the right ways. ",
