            "answer_text": "Oooo, I\u2019ve been wondering when one of these questions would come up. Now, these are only my opinions, but to get you started, I\u2019ll be as informational as possible (XD) BTS - now I know that this is of course gonna be a big #1 answer but yes, these seven boys are very talented. They have many good songs, and I suggest you start with the Wings album and LY album: Tear. Those are my favorite albums by them of all time. Of course you should listen to all their other songs but that\u2019s just to get you started. (Also Dionysus is my favorite song from their new album how bout you?)Stray Kids - They\u2019ve been a group now for about three years and I must say they are by far in my top five best groups. Their new album, Miroh, is an album that absolutely blessed my ears so I suggest you listen to that as well as one of their songs called MIA. I have no idea if this is an underrated song or not but it\u2019s one of my favorite songs.Red Velvet - I personally think that all of their songs are bobs and you should definitely check them out. That\u2019s all. Enough said lol.ATEEZ - Love \u2018em. 10/10 songs, I suggest you check out Say My Name, Pirate King, and Treasure just to get you started.MAMAMOO - They\u2019re by far my favorite girl group. Amazing vocals and four beautiful girls. Starry Night, Egotistc, Gogobebe, and Sleep in the Car are just a few songs I recommend.BLACKPINK - Now I know that they\u2019ve been getting a lot of backlash mostly because of Jennie recently (and most of their songs are subpar) but I figured I should put them here just so that you could find your own taste because everyone has their own. I didn\u2019t want to be too biased in here, but if you do listen to some, I suggest Kill This Love, Ddu-Ddu Ddu-Ddu, Kick It, Boombayah, and maybe Playing With Fire.All NCT Subunits - Now there are 21 people in this whole group alone so I don\u2019t expect you to get to know their names but their songs like Chain, Baby Don\u2019t Stop (provocative I know but that\u2019s actually a good many of their songs), Chewing Gum, Fire Truck, Boss, Superhuman, Baby Don\u2019t Like It, and Regular are actually complete bops I totally recommend. Also if you want the whole 21 people Black On Black is a good sign as well.That\u2019s all I would recommend you for now. I know how bad it is to be rushed into something someone else likes and feeling overwhelmed so I\u2019m just gonna let you figure out what else you\u2019d like from K-Pop at your own pace and by yourself. Hope I helped though! ",

            "answer_text": "Ooooh that\u2019s an interesting question. Depending on which gen they\u2019re from, each person will answer differently. I will try to be as objective as possible! Legends These are groups that every K-pop fan should know. These are the groups that pave the way for the current groups we have. Now these groups will most likely not end up being your ultimate favourite group but I think it\u2019s important to recognise and acknowledge them for what they have brought to the Korean music industry. Girls Generation/SNSD  They originally debuted with 9 members, but member Jessica left in 2014. Their famous songs include Gee, I Got A Boy, Genie, The Boys and of course, their debut song Into The New World. They are very versatile and can pull of virtually any concepts; from solemn to cute to sexy to girl crush. Big Bang  They debuted with 5 members, but member Seungri had to leave (check out the Burning Sun scandal for more details if you want). They have been in the industry for a long time and is one of the few still active. Their famous songs include Fantastic Baby, Haru Haru, Lies, Let\u2019s Not Fall In Love, Loser, Bang Bang Bang and more. They have been caught in many scandals, but are absolutely a must-know for K-pop fans. Super Junior/Suju  Now K-pop won\u2019t be K-pop without Suju! I don\u2019t follow them closely, but there are quite a few member changes. They originally started off with 12 members but there are a lot of member changes so I won\u2019t focus on that. Their famous songs include (of course) Sorry Sorry, Mr Simple, Devil, U, Black Suit and many more. Understandable since they have been in the industry since 2005 \u2014 that\u2019s 15 years! They promote outside of Korea too, Japan, China and America. Shinhwa  They are the longest running boy band in the history of K-pop. They have been active since 1998 \u2014 that\u2019s 22 years! While maybe not as well-known compared to other newer groups, their contributions to the industry are still significant. It saddens me to see fewer international fans recognise them these days, but they are loved by other fans too. Their famous songs include This Love, Wild Eyes, Perfect Man, Venus and more. They have been in the industry for a long time and are a definite must-know! 2NE1  The epitome of \u201cgirl crush\u201d, 2NE1 is known for their strong concepts that are unique and different. They experiment with different genres as well. Their famous songs include Fire, I Am The Best, Come Back Home, Lonely and more. They have powerful vocals, powerful rapping skills, powerful dancing skills with visuals as well. Wonder Girls (there are too many at this point!)  At this point there are too many legendary groups. But Wonder Girls created a worldwide sensation with their song Nobody (yes I need to mention this). It blew up everywhere and I sang this song when I was without knowing it was K-pop. I mean, the lyrics were English (I want nobody nobody but you!) so yep. Their famous songs include Nobody (duh!), Tell Me, Why So Lonely, So Hot and their debut Irony. OTHER EQUALLY NOTABLE GROUPS T-ARA Kara Brown Eyed Girls TVXQ EVEN OLDER GROUPS (known as the first generation) H.O.T SES Sechs Kies Seo Taji & Boys G.O.D \u201cBetween here and there\u201d generation These are groups that can be considered the generation around the 2010s, veteran groups that are still active. I consider these groups the breakthrough to international market because of the diversity in music. Of course, all groups contribute to the \u201cHallyu Wave\u201d in their own manner. I won\u2019t elaborate more on them but if you\u2019re interested you can look them up! SHINee  EXO  Girls Day  Apink  BEAST/Highlight  Sistar  F(X)  2PM and 2AM  4Minute  Miss A  There are waaaaay more groups so here are just a few. Of course, we have our third and fourth generation of K-pop groups. I\u2019ll name a few you probably know: BTS, Twice, Blackpink, Red Velvet, GFriend, Got7, Mamamoo (third generation) and Itzy, Izone, TxT (fourth generation) The generation thingy has been disputed over but in my personal opinion, there are four generations of K-pop. I know there are many who believe there are three generations of K-pop, and that\u2019s perfectly fine too! So these groups are the ones you will probably take on as your ultimate groups. It\u2019s up to you to explore and determine the group that clicks with you, so I won\u2019t dwell on that. At the end of the day, I just want you to be more aware of older generation groups and their contributions :) Even if they may not be as significant as they used to, remember that they are the reason why K-pop is so successful today.
