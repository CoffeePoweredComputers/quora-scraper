            "answer_text": "Even more so, the real-life presence which he gave off at the concerts was even more powerful and thrilling than the videos. It felt much more personal and energetic as well, actually standing there rather than staring at a computer screen. Another huge part of the whole experience was to have all those equally or even more enthusiastic and absolutely crazy fans around you. The power of the crowd really makes up for a huge part of why concerts are such an amazing thing, and the audience seeing Queen is particularly fun and wild in its own way, and this sort of vibe complimented with Freddie\u2019s energy so amazingly well, that the result was just beyond great. So I\u2019d say he was most definitely as energetic as he seemed in most videos, even more at the live concert itself ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely!! The first time I saw Queen they played for a solid 2 hours 45 minutes and Freddie was a ball of energy. He was prancing about the stage the entire time while singing flawlessly. It was amazing to see them in concert. I saw him perform two times after that and it was the same. I feel bad for anyone that never got to see him. ",
