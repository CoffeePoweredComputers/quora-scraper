            "answer_text": "im not an expert of music or psychology but judging from my own experience, it's about the environment you were born and grow up in, and how is your feeling/ emotional state at the moment. I don't really listen to a lot of music while im at middle school. my dad would play pop or classic rock songs at night, and my neighborhood would play our local genre of music at our neighborhood event. because of that, whenever I heard pop, rock, or local music I would most likely like it and enjoy it. at junior high school, I couldn't catch up with a lot of classes so i would get sad and stressed. and while scrolling through youtube i found skrillex, so i try to listen to it and i instantly fell in love with it, and so i begin to search for another artists, i found zomboy, knife party, marauda, trampa, skism, excision space laces, and a lot more. i like dubstep and such because it represent how i feel: such as rage, anger, and adrenaline flowing through my vein. and then at 9th grade, my ex, who cheated on me after 2 years of dating made me sad, stressed, and angry. and then i listen to joji, xxxtentacion and some lofi stuff. their music would yet again represent how i feel: sadness, loneliness and silence. i would listen to death grips, godspeed you black emperor when im feeling mad. i would listen to some rock when I'm feeling energetic and not wanting to lose control of myself. i would listen to some dream pop and such when I'm feeling down i would listen to music that matches my feelings at the moment. i listen to music to express those feeling that i can't express verbally because I'm bad at expressing feelings, i easily feel a mood swing, I'm bad at getting a hang of myself when I'm feeling anger, sadness or happiness.

            "answer_text": "Music is the Universal language in all human cultures here on Planet Earth. The Creator of all Heaven and Earth knew that music is the soothing balm for us in every aspect of human life. There\u2019s music in the Church ( satan was the chief musician of The Lord GOD ALMIGHTY unitl he was kicked out of The KINGDOM OF GOD- whe he tried to take over fron The Creator ) and in every other gatherings of Christianity in Praise and Worship and other joyful settings, at weddings, when couples bring home their babies ( especially the first born), there\u2019s music at funerals, birds and other lower animals chirp musical sounds in all of their rituals, in their mating seasons, etc, etc. Music is an intergral as it is interfaith- and is for everyone everywhere. So, that\u2019s why \u201cpeople enjoy different types of musics\u201d and the word \u201cdifferent\u201d is to be held in the highest regard because whether i don't like your style of music or you don't like my style of music, we must respect each other\u2019s differences no matter what, where, or whom, (or is it whose?) Furthermore, what makes us all happy is the love which we\u2019re all failing to practice in everything toward one another. ",
