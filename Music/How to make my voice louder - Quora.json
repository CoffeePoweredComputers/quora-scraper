            "answer_text": "Finally. A question about my undisputed area of expertise. First of all, there are some aspects that simply naturally make people louder than others: the shape and size of the voice box, lung capacity, etc. So some people (yours truly) have an advantage. Deeper voice tones also tend to carry further. But in terms of things that you can actually do something about, a lot of it is posture and delivery. You need to speak from the diaphragm - also called \u2018speaking from the belly button.\u2019 Your voice should not start in your throat. This will just exhaust your throat. You need to breathe and start your speech from far lower in your body, using the power in your chest and abdomen to push the air up. I liken this sensation to tensing your abdomen like you\u2019re about to get punched there. This is approximately where your diaphragm is, and if you use this part of your body to manipulate your breath, you will get a louder, more powerful voice. Relax your vocal cords. Your throat should be used more as a megaphone, and should be as open as possible. You should not feel air exiting out through your nasal passages - this will take away from your deeper tones and make you sound too nasally. (Obviously, some air will exit out of your nose, but you shouldn\u2019t feel it.) Shoulders back. Chin up. Hands either at your sides or resting on a podium. Eyes forward. Your entire body should be set up in order to allow freedom of breath movement and maximum presence. If you do this right, you can actually feel your voice \u2018vibrating\u2019 through your body to a certain extent. And you will be loud. Also, \u2018loudness\u2019 also has a lot to do with enunciation and posture. If you tend to mumble, practice speaking clearer. If you tend to stand hunched over, practice standing tall. It\u2019s not just about speaking loudly. It\u2019s about having a commanding presence that gets the attention of others, even without words. ",

            "answer_text": "By making your vocal folds vibrate more strongly. That is done by increasing the pressure of air passing through them. That is done by taking in more air on your in-breath, allowing the diaphragm to descend (find a diagram on google search, if you don\u2019t know what or where that is) more than for normal speech, which means allowing your belly to expand as the diaphragm pushes downwards whilst pulling the lungs more open, so you have more air under a higher pressure. It is then on the outbreath that you use that high pressure to cause your vocal folds to vibrate more intensively, strongly (right behind your Adam\u2019s Apple) between your throat and your lungs. Now, that is a technical kind of approach, being aware of the \u201cmachinery\u201d involved. It\u2019s a necessary aspect of developing a wider volume range. Another way is using the permission that acting gives - act as if you are in an emergency situation and need help. You could be seriously injured, but not in your central or upper body; your voice is there, it\u2019s the one way the character may be able to escape the terrible situation he is in. Shout out, as loud as you can. As long as your breath allows you. Now, for the in-breath, the actor in you must organise things so that you consciously, yet quickly, refill your lungs, and allow the diaphragm to descend to the limit, and from there on an extended outbreath, you yell for help again. It\u2019s a question of using the permission of theatre, of being an actor, to seem to be in distress, to act as if you are - yet another dimension in your awareness is detached and working. The final stage is to do all that, but with a keyboard nearby you play the note one octave above middle C, and hold that in your scream - so you are screaming on one note. Maybe you\u2019ll need help from someone else for all this. But you repeat many times, with pauses, gradually moving up, note by note, from the middle notes of your range up to the highest and then all the way back down to the lowest; always with an emotional urgency behind. Use fear for the first few tries. Then change to mad laughter, roar with laughter. Then shout with anger\u2026.. always on a note. Take pauses, and sometimes do the opposite by making soft, gentle sounds on different notes. Do all this regularly, in a space that allows it without upsetting anyone else. After the session your voice will feel and sound strange for a few hours, maybe a few days, but gradually you should feel that your capacity to vary the volume of your voice has increased considerably. You can then choose the volume of your voice according to the circumstances you are in, and without any particular after effects. ",
