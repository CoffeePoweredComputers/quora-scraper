            "answer_text": "I have recorded over 100 songs and the amount of time varies depending on the song. I have recorded songs in as little as an hour and have taken the whole day on others. It depends a lot on the arrangement and just how prepared you are. It also depends on just how good the people you are working with are. Just to demonstrate what I mean while recording in Hawaii the studio I used my co-producer and sound engineer was also a fantastic musician. in a 2 hour period we were able to have him do a keyboard part, piano part and drum part where I did the bass and guitar parts and then record the vocals. The song was a 4 minute song but being able to lay down 5 instrument tracks and not only the lead vocals but also the backing vocals in that amount of time was fantastic. We were able to accomplish this because Pierre was so good at his job. I\u2019ve done similar recording in New Mexico because the studio I used there the guy was also very talented. I did a song that was only an acoustic guitar and my vocals and we did that song in less than an hour. I recorded at the Sound Factory and it was so time consuming at times and it could take pretty much all day to do a song. The biggest difference was the fact the guy I was working with was not a musician as well as being a sound engineer so it took time to get the song the way I wanted it. When I recorded in Manila, Philippines the studio there the guy was just so anal I laid down my tracks and came back about 8 hours later and I really wasn\u2019t happy with the end product so I should have stayed and made sure I got what I wanted but the guy had done the production for Crosby, Stills and Nash so I figured he had to be good. Bottom line is that there are so many factors you have to take into consideration that there is no black and white answer to your question. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the strangest part of it is that it doesn\u2019t *feel* like a long time. But that doesn\u2019t answer your question. Modern recording is about perfection. To the extent possible we want to get a perfect recording, but we can go back later and touch up (think Photoshop for audio) the little imperfections that arise. That means recording each track separately - drums, guitar, bass, vocals, etc. The more there is the longer it\u2019ll take. I had my niece in the studio last summer for a couple of simple Christmas songs that were mainly her voice + acoustic guitar. We added bass and drums later. Just to get her and the guitar recorded took about 4 hours per song. The first hour was spent going through the music, getting down the chord progressions that we would use (she\u2019s rather jazzy so regular chords are boring), lyrics, all that stuff. This would culminate in sitting around playing guitar and singing the entire song. After that it was another 30\u201345 minutes to get the guitar part recorded perfectly, recording it perhaps 10 times. This usually included a few \u201coh crap\u201d moments when we would start over. After that it\u2019s time to sing. Thankfully these were single vocal with no background vocals. We would spend an hour to an hour and a half with her singing. Repeatedly. There were a few \u201coh crap\u201d moments there as well, but it\u2019s quite easy to just restart at the beginning of a phrase and continue. Sometimes the last take is mainly the one we use. The producer helps her with suggestions (\u201cpour on the sweetness on this take\u201d, \u201clet\u2019s be a little subdued\u201d, etc.) so that he can mix and match later. After all that it\u2019s time to put together the guitar + vocal version that will be the foundation for whatever else we might do with the song. So the producer (this is small studio) goes through piece by piece for another hour to hour and a half and listens to each vocal, marking for each phrase which his favorites are. After that we go back through and piece together the whole song based on our favorite pieces. Again, this process would be much much longer for a recording with a whole band. At this point, he fixes up any bad pitches, silences the vocals between phrases, etc. When he finishes we have a good recording. Now, he goes back through and adds a bass line and percussion. Often we just use recorded instruments for this (hard to explain until you see it, but they sound great). This part is actually easier than the rest of it. Now, that\u2019s for a song that\u2019ll have four tracks total at the end: guitar, vocal, bass, percussion. Your normal pop song will have 10+ tracks between all instruments and vocals. Scale this up accordingly. ",

            "answer_text": "Very generic question, for there are myriads of ways to create a recording. I'll keep it simple though.A singer/songwriter with a guitar only needs two microphones: one for the voice, one for the guitar - although most studio's might use two for the guitar, to get a  stereo recording.If it is a fullblown popsong, then instruments may be played by professional session musicians (for solo artists/vocalists) or by the members of the band.Or, the whole arrangement may be made by one person using the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) protocol. This is how most modern popsongs and filmscores are created, by just one or two persons - think of AVICII, Daft Punk, Royksopp, Aphex Twin, Moby and many, many more.MIDI enables a musician to trigger sounds via any controller that can send MIDI, such as a MIDI-keyboard, or MIDI-drums, or a MIDI-guitar or a MIDI wind-controller. None of these controller make sounds, they just send performance info to a soundmodule (which can be standalone hardware or a soundlibrary on a computer), and that module then produces the sound.When I hit a key on my MIDI-keyboard, two pieces of MIDI information are sent to the computer or soundmodule: the \"type\" of event (note on) and the velocity (power) with which the key is pressed (value between 1 amd 127). If I release the key a \"note off\" message is sent. When recording MIDI, the length of a note is the time between note on and note off.In the recording program (known as DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)) you can see this MIDI info in the Piano Roll. MIDI in Logic Pro X   In a DAW, besides MIDI, you can also directly record audio - just like on a taperecorder in the analog days. So that is why you see both audio and MIDI in any DAW. The DAW (in this case Logic Pro X) will contain the complete song.  Audio in Logic Pro X  The big advantage of this way of production is firstly  that MIDI is, the only digital protocol (since 1981!) for musical performance data, there are no other protocols, so there's never any mismatch with hardware or software. The second big advantage is that digital audio is now of a much better potential quality then analog recording ever was, even though there is still a perception bias of it being harsh. This is no longer true, in spite of what \"analog believers\" will try to tell you. I can make digital audio that even a blind audio engineer will not be able to tell apart from taperecorded (= analog) audio. Here is my (strictly amateur) rendition of this old Randy Newman song.

            "answer_text": "I have been playing in the most advanced youth orchestra in the state of Utah for a little over a year. This orchestra likes to record YouTube videos and songs throughout the year all as a way to spread the beauty of music around the world. Anyways, I have only participated in 3 recording sessions. These recording sessions are usually well structured. All of the section leaders (and maybe more) get a set of headphones. These headphones usually only output the click track unless the conductor wants to hear back what was just recorded. Then the song is broken into sections. These sections are usually partitioned according to their difficulty. If the first 20 measures are easy for the majority of the orchestra but the next 20 are hard, we then have 2 sections: measures 1\u201320 and measures 20\u201340. We then play each section 2 or 3 times, recording each time. If there is a super obvious mistake made during the recording of a section, that recording is scrapped and we start again. If you cough, we start over. If you bump your stand, we start over. If you breathe a little to heavy, we start over. Perfection is key. Usually after the conductor feels good about a section, we will play and record it at least 1 more time as a \u2018safety take\u2019. And then after all the sections have been recorded, we play the entire song over again as one big safety take. While recording section 1, the conductor will, if played absolutely perfectly, continue onto section 2 without stopping. That way the audio editors can get the audio to mesh perfectly. It is all very well choreographed. The conductor of this orchestra once recorded a song that had a very difficult-to-reach note for the violins. So they recorded the song up to the point of that note, stopped, let all the violins find that note and hold it out, recorded a few seconds of that note, and then continued the song. I wasn\u2019t there for that recording session but it sounded like fun. That is why it takes so long to record a song. Perfection. Any tiny mistake and the entire recording is garbage. ",

Add about an hour for setup and one hour to mix and master the song. Of course, if one or two microphones are positioned properly and the vocal and instrumental performance levels are spot on, you can do the song in one take. Here\u2019s an example of one song performed by three musicians, one of them singing, in one take with two microphones. It took about an hour to get everyone in the right position. It took about half an hour to decide how much reverb and EQ to add to the original recording.

For example: I can create a song from scratch in my home studio in an hour and you wouldn\u2019t probably believe when you hear the song that it only took an hour. The recording itself is quite a simple feat nowadays. The question is how many people you have in the band / orchestra and how much processing you want to do after all the stuff has been recorded. What are your ambitions regarding the final outcome etc. So the question is actually: what are the various factors into which you can invest time and effort during the recording of a song and the answer is pretty endless. It\u2019s all a matter of what you want to do and how you do it. ",

I\u2019m assuming the latter: I would buy a high-quality USB mic and record it at home. You can connect it to an iphone, ipad, or computer. Record the vocals with some decent onboard effects so you\u2019ll feel in the moment, but then send the raw audio takes to me (or another audio engineer) and we will work on it over a ZOOM session together to get a professional result. You will waste a lot of time \u201ctracking\u201d (recording) vocals in a traditional studio and over time, a LOT of money. How would I know? Because I\u2019ve MADE a lot of money this way. And I hate to see artists waste their already incredibly small budgets practicing singing and rapping their songs in a traditional studio. This can be done at home in a closet or, at a friends house with a closet. It can be done when you\u2019re inspired and in the moment. You will get better takes, with more passion.
