            "answer_text": "I know I can\u2019t sing better than the performer does but I\u2019m certainly not in competition with them, nor am I making any comment on how they sing. I sing because singing is very pleasurable. It can make me feel better when I feel low, and my family knows that if I\u2019m singing, I\u2019m feeling ok, or great, and if I\u2019m not, I\u2019m pretty depressed. If I\u2019m in public, and feel the need, I will sing very, very quietly, but in my car, I belt it out. ( I actually have a nice voice but I have a very limited range, so I can\u2019t hit the high/low notes). Boy do I envy the likes of Cindy Lauper, her range is phenomenal. I don\u2019t care if people see me singing in the car and at home, I sing along with the songs I know on the radio. There\u2019s nothing wrong with singing and when I was a kid at camp, some of the very best times were around the campfire singing our lungs out. ",

In fact, I was concerned about getting headphones because I was slightly concerned I would break into song on the Metro or something. It\u2019s all I can do not to dance sometimes, lol. I have yet to embarrass myself but I\u2019ve come close a couple of times. Also, as a kid I got terrible car sickness. Unfortunately my parents were very much into road trips so I had to figure out how to cope. If I wasn\u2019t curled up asleep in the back seat, I was singing because it helped me not think about my queasiness. I\u2019d have to do the same thing while swinging on our giant swing set so I wouldn\u2019t get sick. I remember belting out Elton John\u2019s \u201cCrocodile Rock\u201d the most. And other songs now that I blush about realizing what I was singing, haha. ",
