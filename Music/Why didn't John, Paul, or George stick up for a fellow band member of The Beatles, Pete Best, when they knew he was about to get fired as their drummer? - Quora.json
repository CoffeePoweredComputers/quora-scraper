            "answer_text": "Because they were the ones who wanted Pete fired. They got Brian to do their dirty work for them since he was their manager, but they wanted him out and Ringo in. Pete Best became their drummer in the first place because the Beatles were playing at the Casbah Club, which was owned by Mona Best, Pete\u2019s Mom. However, by the time of Pete\u2019s firing, The Beatles had gone to Germany, honed their craft, and came back to Liverpool, playing the Cavern Club (where Brian Epstein discovered them), which was a step up from the Casbah Club. Now they no longer needed the Casbah Club, Mona Best or her son. It was thus a lot easier for them to get rid of Pete, which they had wanted for a while. The reasons fro Pete\u2019s firing are myriad: Pete was better looking than John and Paul, or he had a bigger fan base, or Ringo was a better drummer. While any or all of these may have something to do with it, I think the reason is a lot simpler: Pete wasn\u2019t part of the clique. The Beatles in the early days were more than a band, they were a gang. Outsiders weren\u2019t allowed in. Astrid and her friends in Germany tried, but they were never allowed into the Inner Sanctum of the Beatles. Pete Best played with the Beatles, but that was it. Once they were off stage, John. George and Paul went their way, and Pete went his way. However, during the Hamburg days, one \u201coutsider\u201d was allowed to hang out with them, and that was Ringo, who was performing there with Rory Storme and the Hurricanes. So why was Ringo allowed in? Because they got each other. Rory and his band were \u201crock stars\u201d. Pete was the son of a business owner. Ringo was a working stiff from the streets like John. Paul and George, and he loved hanging out with them during their \u201coff\u201d time when the other bands, including Pete, wanted to be alone. So when they saw they no longer needed Pete in the band to insure the would get gigs, the decided now they could get their buddy Ringo in the band and make their gang complete. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, they DID stick up for Best. Producers in Germany, and Decca Records told them Best was lacking in drumming skills in the studio. They had kept Pete in as drummer despite knowing he was holding them back. When they got their big chance with EMI and George Martin, they had to stop waiting for Best to become the Best drummer. So they got Ringo, the top drummer in the Liverpool area and a good friend! As to why, we can go back to Best joining the early Beatles. He wasn\u2019t asked because he was a good drummer. He was barely adequate at Best. The \u2018prefab four\u2019, Stu on bass, and the three guitarists John, George and Paul had a gig in Hamburg. It was 3 months work! To get it they needed a drummer. Paul made it clear he was not going to be the drummer. They had to get one to go. They asked many local drummers. Most didn\u2019t want to leave their current band, their families or their country. With the deadline looming to go and desperate, Paul remembered Mona Best\u2019s boy Pete had played drums. Purely an amateur, Pete was their last resort. He agreed to go and became the fifth Beatle. John got his passport at the last minute as well and they left for Hamburg! Despite Pete being a last minute fill in for them to get their ticket to ride to Hamburg, the Beatles remained loyal to Pete and never tried to replace him with a better drummer. In small clubs with lots of drinking, a weak drummer didn\u2019t matter enough to make the effort. But Paul, George and John were aware of his shortcomings, especially after they used a fill in drummer when Pete was unavailable to play. The fill-in drummer\u2019s name? Richard Starkey - aka \u201cRingo Starr\u201d. A couple of years later, Best had improved at the drums but only so far and showed no sign of going further. His timing was a touch off, as as the rest of the band rely on that drum beat it needed to be steady through out the songs. They finally got a shot at making music with EMI records. When big time producer George Martin told the three lads (Stu was gone by then) that they needed a session drummer to play on their 1st single, J, P, and G made a decision to get their manager Brian to fire Pete. P&J went to where Ringo was performing and asked him to join. Ringo agreed to do so after his last show with his band was done in a week. Sources vary on the details as to who was the most responsible for the change in drummers. Paul was known to think Stu\u2019s bass had been lacking. But that was expected as Stu had no prior experience playing unlike the main three Beatles. But Paul only took on the bass when Stu chose to leave the band and he had no desire to be stuck behind the drum set on stage. He only did that when Pete had his turn at singing lead on a song. So Paul would have agreed with Martin\u2019s opinion, but perhaps not led for the change. John, as leader, should have taken on the responsibility. It is likely that when Martin made his announcement John suggested they finally get a new drummer as had often considered doing on occasion even earlier. George was more recently assumed to have been the major force behind replacing Pete with Ringo, possibly after a decision to remove Pete was made. I think it ultimately came down to Martin telling JP&G that a new drummer would be on the recording session. That is when they moved to replace Pete. So Pete was an ok drummer for their live performances. He was not technically good enough for Martin to work with. But good enough for their concerts where a missed beat or note, or off tempo drumming might be overlooked So they actually stuck by Pete as long as they could, until they could do so no longer. Their mistake was in not telling him he was out in person. (from Wikipedia:) Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison all later stated that they regretted the manner in which Best was sacked. Lennon admitted that \"We were cowards when we sacked him. We made Brian do it.\" McCartney stated: \"I do feel sorry for him, because of what he could have been on to.\" Harrison: \"We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go. Historically it may look like we did something nasty to Pete and it may have been that we could have handled it better.\" Starr, on the other hand, feels he has no apology to make: \"I never felt sorry ... I was not involved.\" ",
